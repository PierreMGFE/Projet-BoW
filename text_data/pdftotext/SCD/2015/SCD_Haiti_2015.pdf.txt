Haiti has a vision to become an emerging economy by 2030. Haiti’s geography,
­resources, and history provide it with opportunities. The country has comparative advantages, including its proximity and access to
major markets; a young labor force and a
­dynamic diaspora; and substantial geographic, historical, and cultural assets. Areas
of economic opportunity for Haiti include
agribusiness, light manufacturing and tourism. Building on these opportunities, the
Government of Haiti issued in May 2012 a
Strategic Development Plan (PSDH), aiming
at building a new modern, diversified, resilient, competitive and inclusive economy, respectful of its environment and in which
people’s basic needs are met. This objective
would require ambitious double digit growth
rates, a significant break from the past, based
on an expansion of agriculture, construction,
manufacturing, and tourism.
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in
the last four decades has been disappointing,
however, and poverty remains endemic. A
history of vested interests, political instability, and natural disasters has prevented the
country from realizing its aspirations, trapping the country in a low equilibrium and
keeping it as one of the poorest and least
equal countries in the world. GDP per capita
fell by 0.7 percent per year on average between 1971 and 2013. As a result, in 2012
59 percent of Haitians remained poor and
24 percent suffered from extreme poverty,
indicating that almost 6.3 million Haitians
could not meet their basic needs and 2.5 million could not even cover their food needs.

Executive Summary

This Systematic Country Diagnostic
(SCD) seeks to identify the most important
constraints to and opportunities for inclusive
and sustainable growth in Haiti. To identify
the key constraints to Haiti’s growth and
shared prosperity, an extensive review of the
literature (from both within and outside the
World Bank) was first carried out. Economic
and sector work on Haiti produced in 1980s
and the early 1990s had already identified
most of the country’s challenges and demonstrated that better functioning institutions,
stronger human capital, and improvements
in infrastructure were all needed for Haiti’s
economic growth and shared prosperity.
Rather than listing these again, this report
attempts to provide some prioritization
and identify the most binding constraints,
both quantitatively and through a series
of consultations with stakeholders and the
country team.

Country Profile: What
Makes Haiti Haiti?
A social contract is missing between the
State and its citizens. While overall income
growth is a necessary condition for increasing shared prosperity, it is not sufficient.
Growth that is inclusive of the poor requires
additional mechanisms such as a pro-poor
fiscal regime, as well as targeted social programs and expenditures, not only to redistribute resources towards the poor but also
more importantly to ensure that the less
well-off are an integral part of the process

1

and that opportunities improve for all.
Previous reports have noted, however, that
Haiti has never had a tradition of providing
services to the population or creating an environment conducive to sustainable growth.
Haiti’s tax system generates limited resources
for the government and tends to be regressive. Furthermore, public spending in health,
education, and social protection remains
limited, constraining the government’s ability to provide services and offer equal opportunities to its citizens. In the absence of
government, basic services such as health
and education are mainly provided by non-­
government actors, placing a substantial financial burden on households and delivering
achievements closely linked with household
income.
The reliance on non-government actors
has also weakened public investment
­management. Haiti’s public investment management exhibits a number of distinctive features and practices common to countries
that are aid-dependent, including weak
­appraisal capacity and reliance on donors
to design good projects, hampering the
­effective use of public resources. Sectoral
strategies to guide the prioritization of
­projects are lacking. This leads to a Public
Investment Program composed of projects
that are neither fully assessed nor prioritized.
Furthermore, there is no effective ex-ante
control on disbursements based on the physical progress of projects against plans. While
progress is being made in fiscal reporting by
rolling out the use of a single treasury account, domestically-funded capital expenditures are not yet properly accounted for,
tracked and reported, creating an environment conducive to a lack of transparency
and accountability.

2

The structure of the private sector shows
signs of high degrees of concentration,
hampering the entry of new actors and resulting in high prices for consumers. From
the beginning of the twentieth century, autocratic leaders in Haiti have traded political support from the elite for economic
advantages to this elite. Though publicly
available information on privately held
businesses is limited, many of the same
families who dominated the Haitian economy during the era of Duvalier in the 1970s
and the 1980s seem to remain in control of
large segments of the economy today, resulting in high concentration in a number
of key industries, distorted competition,
and non-transparent business practices in
many instances. Several of the most important food products in the Haitian consumption basket are sold in concentrated
markets, and a preliminary analysis indicates that the prices of these products are
on average about 30–60 percent higher in
Haiti than in other countries from the region. This translates into limited opport­
unities for a substantial expansion of the
formal private sector across most sectors.
Few of Haiti’s established private firms have
modern capital and governance structures
with professional management, limiting
their access to long-term financing.
Political violence has occurred regularly
throughout Haiti’s history, leading to instability. At Independence in 1804, Haiti was
at the forefront of history, being the first nation to abolish slavery. Since then, however,
with some exceptions such as the 30-year
­period of autocratic rule under Francois
Duvalier (Papa Doc) and his son JeanClaude Duvalier (Baby Doc) (1957–86),
Haiti has known a succession of short-lived

Executive Summary

governments. Lacking sufficiently long periods of stability, the country has struggled
to develop the institutional mechanisms
and policy fundamentals essential to economic development and the rule of law.
Disenfranchised and without effective channels to voice needs and demands, citizens
have taken to the streets in protest, sometimes violently. While violent airing of grievances in Haiti’s early history generally took
place in the rural areas, contemporary unrest
tends to break out in the cities, reflecting the
country’s demographic evolution and urbanization over the years. Against this backdrop,
the post-earthquake period has been comparatively stable.
Furthermore, the Haitian population is
one of the most exposed in the world to
­natural disasters—hurricanes, floods and
earthquakes. Between 1971 and 2013, Haiti’s
economy has been subjected to natural disasters almost every year with adverse effects
on growth. The country has a higher number
of disasters per km2 than the average of
the Caribbean countries. In 2008, tropical
storms and hurricanes caused losses estimated at 15 percent of GDP. The earthquake
on January 12, 2010 killed 220,000 people,
displaced 1.5 million people, and destroyed
the equivalent of 120 percent of GDP.
In this unfavorable environment, migration has become a key avenue for Haitians
seeking a better life. Substantial internal migration is taking place, particularly from
rural to urban areas, as people seek better
economic opportunities and better services.
In addition, for both political and economic
reasons, large numbers of Haitians have emigrated throughout the twentieth century
building an important diaspora. A vast majority of Haitians who continue to emigrate

Executive Summary

now seem to do so because they cannot find
work opportunities in Haiti. This large diaspora is a significant source of remittances:
remittances received by Haiti are the highest
among Latin America and Caribbean (LAC)
countries in terms of GDP and the fourth
highest in the world in terms of export
earnings.

Trends and Profile in
Poverty and Shared
Prosperity
While remaining high, poverty has declined in Haiti. Recent findings indicate that
extreme poverty has declined in Haiti from
31 percent of the population in 2000 to 24
percent in 2012. Progress was mainly concentrated in urban areas, however. This trend
is confirmed by both monetary and nonmonetary poverty indicators, with the biggest non-monetary progress recorded in
education. All school-age children go to
school in about 90 percent of the households
compared to about 80 percent in 2001.
Immunization rates are also up.
Recent evidence suggests that this decline
in extreme poverty was driven by labor
­income, private transfers, and aid. Nonagricultural labor income increased by about
3½ percent on average per year, especially
among men, with expansions in construction, telecommunication and transport, all
concentrated in urban areas. Formal employment remains small (13 percent of the labor
force) with agriculture and urban informal
sectors still providing most of the employment with about 40 percent and 47 percent
of the labor market, respectively. Workers’
transfers from abroad have represented more

3

than a fifth of Haiti’s GDP in recent years,
and the percentage of households receiving
private transfers (domestic transfers or remittances from abroad) in Haiti increased
from 42 percent to 69 percent between 2000
and 2012. Furthermore, the 2010 earthquake
resulted in unprecedented aid flows in the
form of money, goods and services. These
external flows have also contributed in reducing poverty over the period, especially
in the metropolitan area which attracted
most of the assistance (in large part because
Port-au-Prince was hit hardest by the
earthquake).

Trends and Drivers of
Growth
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in
the last four decades has been disappointing.
From 1971 to 2013, GDP growth averaged
1.2 percent a year, much lower than the average of the LAC region (3.5 percent) and the
average of economies at the same level of development (3.3 percent). The few periods of
positive growth were short-lived, often followed by a contraction in economic activity.
Furthermore, in light of the country’s important demographic growth, the level of GDP
per capita even fell by 0.7 percent per year
on average between 1971 and 2013. Whereas
low income countries (LICs) have on average
seen their GDP per capita taking off since
the mid-1990s, Haiti was left behind.
Political instability and natural disasters
have taken a toll on growth. Despite investment and increases in the labor force, Haiti’s
growth performance has remained weak, reflecting the natural disasters and political instability the country has experienced. The
departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier initiated
4

a period of intense political instability in
Haiti. Between 1986 and 2014 the country
had 18 changes of president and important
changes in regime. Such political instability
has often been accompanied by violence and
a continuous weakening of state institutions,
the rule of law, and the investment climate,
undermining investor confidence.
Uncertainty as to whether investors can obtain returns from their investments represents one of the main constraints to growth
in Haiti. Political instability has also resulted
in a trade embargo in the first half of the
1990s that crippled private sector activities.
Haiti’s business environment is hampered
by institutional weaknesses. Although governance indicators have improved, Haiti still
ranks lowest in the region in control of
­corruption or government effectiveness.
Efficient mechanisms for international
­arbitration and mediation are lacking.
Guarantees for the protection of investors’
private property rights are insufficient. Legal
and regulatory frameworks are fragmented
and dysfunctional. In particular, a real property cadaster and land registry system is
needed. Furthermore, access to finance is
challenging for both, households and medium- and small-sized enterprises.
Haiti’s infrastructure also falls short.
Island economies are extremely dependent
on the quality, frequency and cost of the
means of transport that link them to markets
which represent both outlets for their products and supply sources for the needed imported goods. The efficiency and effectiveness
of transport, whether by road, by sea, or by
air, therefore strongly affects their competitiveness. The quality of transport and logistics
services in Haiti is low, however, with large
parts of the territory still poorly connected.
Recent evidence indicates, for instance, that
Executive Summary

only 40 percent of people living in rural areas
have access to all-weather roads. Haiti is also
less integrated into the global shipping line
network than many developing countries,
and the costs of loading and unloading a
standard container at Port-au-Prince are by
far the highest of the Caribbean ports.
In particular, the provision of electricity
is problematic. The supply of electricity covers only a small proportion of the country,
with rural areas being particularly neglected.
Only 35 percent of Haitians have access to
electricity (11 percent in rural areas). The
provision of electricity in Haiti is also unstable and there are frequent power cuts and
surges, which can result in serious damage to
industrial equipment. Business owners cite
the lack of reliable electricity supply as the
most binding constraint to private sector development. Despite this poor service, the
cost of electricity is among the highest in the
region. Furthermore, per capita consumption of electricity in Haiti is substantially
lower than in other Caribbean countries, for
example, it is only two percent of the level
observed in the Dominican Republic.
Surveys also point to the lack of qualified
labor. One major constraint faced by enterprises in Haiti is the difficulty to find technicians that are well qualified, particularly in
new technologies and trained managers for
middle management. This forces the country
to position itself as a low cost producer for
goods and services requiring limited skills.
The level of education among the adult population remains low: 45.7 percent of the
adult population (60.5 percent of households’ heads) have never attended school or
have not completed primary education. Not
mastering basic skills such as literacy and
numeracy when starting work represents a
major impediment for their insertion in the
Executive Summary

labor market and, more importantly, for
their ability to absorb post-school training
either on or off the job, and to adapt to
changing job requirements.
The constraints discussed above seem
to be particularly present in the agriculture
and the non-agriculture informal sector,
where most Haitians are likely to continue
working for the foreseeable future. The formal manufacturing and service sectors have
the potential to be an important source of
employment, but because they hire such a
small share of the labor force, even with very
high growth rates, they will not be able to
absorb more than a fraction of the new entrants. The agriculture sector in Haiti has
been declining for many years, the result of
neglected rural infrastructure, weak research
and extension, poorly defined land tenure,
limited access to credit, and under-investment
in human capital. With regard to the informal non-agriculture sector, empirical evidence suggests that a little investment in
years of education or remedial training for
skills acquisition among people who have
been out of the school system for a long
time, as well as improved access to inputs,
such as electricity and water, are associated
with substantial increases in income.

Sustainability
Urbanization is increasing Haiti’s vulnerability to natural disasters. As a safety
valve, migration probably contains poverty
and provides relief to many families through
private transfers. However, moving to urban
areas is putting pressure on the environment,
and leading to the settlement of large populations in vulnerable places. Urban areas
have experienced an explosive expansion
in the past two decades with a near total
5

absence of urban planning and growth regulation. This unplanned urban growth has
created vulnerabilities for both the physical environment and those who live in it.
Furthermore, settlers tend to occupy areas
that are not only prone to risk from disasters,
but are also sometimes nature’s protection
from risks such as coastal ecosystems. Slow
degradation of the environment in such
areas in turn increases the country’s vulnerability as a whole to natural disasters.
Rapid urbanization could also be feeding
greater violence. Youth violence is often expressed as a reaction to perceived social and
economic exclusion—grievances that can
easily be mobilized by political interests.
Rapid migration to urban neighborhoods,
associated with poverty, unemployment, political and social marginalization, limited
­access to services, and weak governance,
could fuel the formation of gangs that engage
at-risk youth and draw them in. Evidence
suggests that migration is associated with
greater violence, as social ties erode. New
migrants are likely to have less access to local
social networks which provide economic and
social support. These grievances have also
contributed to intergenerational conflict, undermining social cohesion and hindering the
capacity of many communities for productive collective action.
Macroeconomic stability has been maintained in the aftermath of the earthquake.
Haiti’s macroeconomic environment has significantly improved over the past decade.
Inflation was brought down to single digits
and international reserves built up to adequate levels. Between 2009 and 2011, Haiti’s
stock of external debt drastically shrank following debt relief. In addition to benefiting
from the HIPC and the MDRIs, Haiti received additional debt cancellation in the
6

aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. The real
effective exchange rate remained aligned
with fundamentals.
Budget constraints are becoming tighter,
however, and could put at risk some of the
recent progress achieved in human development. The country has taken the opportunity
of its greater borrowing space to contract
loans on concessional terms with Republica
Bolivariana de Venezuela through the
Petrocaribe agreement. While the availability
of this concessional financing has allowed
higher levels of public investments and
spending on social programs, it has also allowed a widening of Haiti’s twin fiscal and
current account deficits, increasing the country’s level of indebtedness, although keeping
it at a sustainable level. The decline in aid
and in international oil prices (which affect
the availability of Haiti’s concessional resources) is reducing the country’s fiscal
space. These tighter constraints could put at
risk some of the recent progress achieved in
poverty reduction and human development,
making the country’s balancing act between
developmental needs and fiscal sustainability
even more challenging.

Priorities
A quantitative approach would suggest
a policy mix including higher investment in
human and physical capital, which would
also support greater political stability. Faster
economic growth alone will not be enough
to bring significant improvements in the living standards of most Haitians. Without any
change in the income distribution, reducing
extreme poverty to 3 percent by 2030 would
require a two- to three-fold acceleration in
Haiti’s growth rate with respect to its best
performing years: a very ambitious outcome.
Executive Summary

Policies to ensure more inclusiveness are
thus needed to allow the incomes of the bottom 40 percent to grow faster than the average. In this regard, estimations suggest that
the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution would see their incomes grow faster
than the average if Haiti were to invest in
health, education, and infrastructure, as well
as achieve greater political stability. In turn,
simulations for Haiti indicate that political
stability could be increased—or more
broadly conflict risk reduced—through
higher welfare spending (education, health,
and social protection).
Qualitative research based on consultations brought additional important insights.
Broad consultations were carried out with
stakeholders and the country team. In this
regard, the general story line was validated,
but in addition the consultations highlighted
that:
• Maintaining the stability of the macroeconomic environment called for immediate
attention. The decline in donor assistance—­
returning to pre-earthquake levels—and
lower availability of concessional financing following the drop in international oil
prices raised concerns about the sustainability of many social programs and of the
recent progress in improving access to
some basic services. In this regard, greater
mobilization of own fiscal revenue and
improved efficiency in public expenditure
management were seen as critical.
• Turning to more medium-term challenges, progress needs to be made simultaneously on several fronts. For Haiti to
break from its past and achieve meaningful progress towards poverty reduction, a
piecemeal approach to reform focusing on
one sector only would not work.
Executive Summary

• State capacity needs to be strengthened.
Poor governance and the need to
strengthen the State were generally viewed
as the most important constraints. The
lengthiness of the process should not
deter immediate action, but call for more
realistic expectations. In this regard, many
stakeholders perceived that donors bypassing the Haitian government in favor
of non-State actors, while providing perhaps a quick and short-term response,
continued to undermine the public sector
and could not bring a long-term solution
to the lack of government capacity.
• Restoring the social contract was flagged
as particularly important. Most modern
democracies use fiscal revenue to finance
the State, regulate private activity, and redistribute wealth. In return for these revenues, the State is expected to provide key
services and a level playing field for the
private sector. In Haiti, both sides of this
contract are very weak—few people or
businesses pay taxes, and the State struggles to provide services and appropriate
regulation.
• Barriers to market entry need to be
­removed, competition enhanced, and
small private sector actors supported.
Representatives of the established private
sector recognized the lack of competition
existing in Haiti’s economy, a reflection
in their view of the country’s unfavorable
business environment. In this regard,
civil society expressed concern about the
higher prices and the possible lack of
­innovation that limited competition
implied.
• There was not only a need for more jobs,
but also for better jobs. It was pointed
out that the private sector in Haiti
was not only limited to a couple of large
7

enterprises. Most people in Haiti were occupied in a less visible private sector: in
the agriculture and informal sectors, two
sectors that had been neglected so far.
• The importance of reducing vulnerabilities
was also stressed. In the face of recurring
shocks and vulnerability, better risk management strategies and better targeting in
social protection should be a priority to
protect households and individual livelihoods. Disaster risk management should
be strengthened. Risks need to be identified
and understood better, as well as reduced
in the future through greater awareness
when investing. Financial protection needs
to be designed in case risks materialize.
• Finally, the consultations made it clear
that there was limited evidence to inform
planning and targeting of programs and
policies. Discussions with stakeholders, as
well as discussions with the country team
confirmed that it is difficult to carry out
effective development policies without appropriate statistics or analytics.

8

Policy packages—or buckets—rather
than independent activities in sectors were
thus recommended. The SCD points out
five broad themes around which activities
need to be organized in order to ignite a
process whereby Haiti could set itself on a
new development path: (a) balancing macroeconomic stability with developmental
needs; (b) improving statistics and analytics; (c) creating greater economic opportunities and better jobs, including through
infrastructure and human capital; (d) (re)
building the social contract; and (e) reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. Progress on all these themes is
needed simultaneously. In light of the
tighter budget constraints facing the government, maintaining the stability of the
macroeconomic environment, and improving knowledge and statistics to increase the effectiveness of public policy
(including more transparent fiscal reporting) call more particularly for immediate
attention.

Executive Summary

1. Country Profile
Opportunities and a
Vision
Haiti’s geography, resources, and history provide it with opportunities. Haiti occupies the western, smaller portion of the
island of Hispaniola, which it shares with the
Dominican Republic. Both by area and population, Haiti is the third largest Caribbean nation (after Cuba and the Dominican Re­public),
with 27,750 square kilometers and an estimated population of 10.4 million people. The
country has comparative advantages, including its proximity and access to major markets; a young labor force and a dynamic
diaspora; and substantial geographic, historical, and cultural assets.1 There is a pent-up
demand and many untapped markets that
the private sector can explore. Areas of economic opportunity for Haiti include in agribusiness, light manufacturing and tourism.
Furthermore, Haiti possesses mineral potential. According to the World Economic
Forum, Haiti’s economic fundamentals could
allow the country to become a vibrant economy and grow by 6–8 percent a year if adequate policies were in place World Economic
Forum (2011).
Building on these opportunities, the
country has a vision to become an emerging
economy by 2030. In May 2012, the Government of Haiti issued a Strategic Development
Plan (PSDH), building on the Action Plan
for the Recovery and Development of Haiti
(PARDH) prepared following the 2010
earthquake. The PSDH details the PARDH’s
vision and strategic plan for the country’s
long-term development, and four major
Country Profile

areas of work for the recovery and development of Haiti: territorial reform, economic
reform, social reform and institutional reform. The Plan aims at building a new modern, diversified, resilient, competitive and
inclusive economy, respectful of its environment and in which people’s basic needs are
met. This objective would require ambitious
double digit growth rates, a significant break
from the past, based on an expansion of agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and
tourism.
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in
the last four decades has been disappointing, however, and poverty remains endemic.
A history of vested interests, political instability, and natural disasters has prevented
the country from realizing up to now its aspirations, trapping it in a low equilibrium
and keeping it as one of the poorest and
most unequal countries in the world. GDP
per capita fell by 0.7 percent per year on average between 1971 and 2013. As a result,
the overall poverty headcount amounts to
about 59 percent and extreme poverty to
24 percent in 2012, indicating that almost
6.3 million Haitians cannot meet their basic
needs and 2.5 million cannot even cover
their food needs.

A Broken Social
Contract
While overall income growth is a necessary condition for increasing shared prosperity,
it is not sufficient. Growth is not a cure-all,
but it is essential to allow Haitians to escape
9

poverty. Unfortunately, Haiti has yet to achieve
a sufficiently strong growth momentum. How­
ever, even the modest resources the country
has generated in the past have not been distributed in an inclusive manner. Growth that
is inclusive of the poor requires additional
mech­anisms such as a pro-poor fiscal regime,
as well as targeted social programs and expenditures, not only to redistribute resources towards the poor but also more importantly to
ensure that the less well-off are an integral part
of the process and that opportunities improve for all.2
A social contract is missing between the
State and its citizens. Haiti is not very inclusive. The Bank’s 1998 Poverty Report noted
that “Haiti has never had a tradition of governance aimed at providing services to the
population or creating an environment conducive to sustainable growth.” A number of
Haitian and international observers broadly
agree that the Haitian State remains ineffective and delivers little to its population. To a
large extent, this results from the particular
winner-takes-it-all nature of Haitian politics

Figure 1.1
35

and economics which creates little incentive
for broad-based coalition building. “Haitian
institutions have never provided justice, education or healthcare to the majority of the
population” (Lockhart and Forman 2013).
Instead, a small economic elite has supported
a state that makes only negligible investments in human resources and basic infrastructure (World Bank 1998). “Governance
and state capacity to effectively formulate
and implement sound policies, and to deliver
core public services to the population, are
weak. The state is present largely in the major
urban centers and has been unable to provide basic services or infrastructure to large
portions of the population” (Buss 2013).
Haiti’s tax system generates limited resources for the government and tends to be
regressive (figure 1.1). Despite recent improvements in tax collection, Haiti collects fewer domestic revenues in terms of
GDP than comparable countries in the
Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC).
Furthermore, Haiti’s tax revenues rely heavily on indirect taxes which affect consumers

independently of their income level. The
ratio of direct to indirect taxes stood at about
30 percent in 2011, a level inferior to that of
most countries in LAC and to the average of
low income countries (LIC): a fact largely
explained by the sizable share of Haiti’s
­revenues coming from international trade.
Tax systems relying relatively more on direct
taxes tend to be more progressive because
in such systems the burden of taxes weighs
Country Profile

differently on economic agents of varying income levels.
Furthermore, social spending remains
limited and the delivery of basic services
strongly inequitable. Public spending in
health, education, and social protection
amounts to 5 percent of GDP, below comparator countries, limiting the government’s
ability to offer equal opportunities to its citizens. At the same time, many large spending
11

items such as fuel subsidies clearly favor the
rich. In this regard, the rise in fuel prices in
October 2014, as well as the recent decline in
international oil prices, could be conducive
to more inclusiveness in public spending. In
the absence of government, basic services
such as health and education are mainly provided by non-government actors. Eighty to
ninety percent of primary school students
attend non-public schools, placing a substantial financial burden on households and
delivering achievements closely linked with
household income. Outcomes are equally
unfavorable to the poor in the health sector:
in 2012, infant mortality was 62 per 1,000
live births for the richest quintile compared
to 104 for the poorest quintile.3
In the absence of public services, non-­
State service providers have stepped in. In
­response to limited government services,
foreign assistance—as well as a growing
number of international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) since the 1950s—has
provided a broad range of dispersed public
services. In many remote rural areas, the
State has extremely limited delivery capacity, and NGOs provide services to the population. Their services are also important
among the urban poor. In health, about 50
percent of total health expenditure is provided by NGOs, which for the most part
­deliver primary health care services and
NGOs or private, for-profit institutions run
over 80 percent of all primary and secondary schools. In water and sanitation, while
the National Water and Sanitation Directorate (DINEPA) has greatly improved its presence in remote rural areas by creating,
training and supporting local water committees, interventions are often funded
through NGOs. These non-state actors are
largely disconnected from the state system
12

and fragmented among themselves, leading
to highly uneven service provision.
The reliance on non-State actors, particularly donors, has also weakened ­public
investment management. Haiti’s public investment management exhibits a number of
distinctive features and practices common to
countries that are aid-dependent, including
weak ­appraisal capacity and reliance on donors to design good projects. These hamper
the effectiveness of public investments
(box 1.1). While the government’s Strategic
Development Plan (PSDH) provides broad
guidance on government priorities, sectoral
strategies to guide the prioritization of projects are lacking. This leads to a Public Investment Program (PIP) composed of projects
that are neither fully assessed nor prioritized.
Furthermore, there is no effective ex-ante
control on disbursements based on projects’
physical progress against plans. More importantly, although progress in fiscal reporting
is being made by rolling out the use of a single treasury account, domestically-funded
capital expenditures are not yet properly accounted for, tracked and reported, creating
an environment conducive to a lack of transparency and accountability, as well as to mismanagement of scarce public resources.
Fi­nally, even though the existing legal framework is acceptable for the management of
public investments, its requirements are
rarely respected, with numerous processes
and ­procedures that, when not redundant,
are ­excessively elaborate.

BOX 1.1

Common Features of PIM in Donor-Dependent Countries

Public investment management (PIM) systems in donor-dependent settings tend to exhibit the
following distinctive features:
Investment guidance, project development and preliminary screening: government strategy documents, such as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), tend to be directed towards the donors,
rather than covering both external and domestic investment in an integrated and coherent manner.
They are at a level of generality that limits the extent to which they can provide a basis for preliminary screening of projects, and are often not supported by effective sector strategies.
Formal project appraisal: there is a reliance on donors to conduct appraisal, with a serious lack of
appraisal capacity within government; and a lack of guidance on defining the project preparation
process and on how to appraise domestically-financed projects and PPPs. Donor capacity-building
on appraisal tends to be agency-specific, with little or no domestic training capacity.
Independent review of appraisal: reflecting reliance on donors, there is a lack of capacity for independent review, either of donor projects or domestically-financed projects.
Project selection and budgeting: the budget is divided into a recurrent and a development budget,
with weak integration between the two and substantial off-budget aid. The use of Public Investment
Programs (PIPs) remains quite common, but these can be poorly connected to fiscal policy and the
budget. In practice, a PIP tends to be more a coordination tool than a tool to manage the project portfolio strategically or to help enforce review of individual project proposals before they can be considered for budget funding. Agreement by a donor to finance a project is tantamount to the project being
included in the budget—subject to basic screening for consistency with a PRSP (which is not difficult
given their generality) and any required counterpart financing being affordable.
Project implementation: unpredictability of donor funding (especially budget support) interrupts
project implementation due to lack of alternative financing. Weak project management capacity
induces donors to set up multiple Project Implementation Units (PIUs) within implementing
agencies that initially help to speed implementation and compliance with fiduciary standards,
but which cut across and negatively impact on in-line capacities and accounting and reporting
systems. Procurement is undertaken by PIUs or donors to donor standards rather than national
procurement standards.
Project adjustment: reliance on donors to trigger review of any projects that are off-track. No similar mechanism for domestically-financed projects.
Facility operation: formal hand-over procedures on completion of donor projects, but inadequate
asset registration systems; and inadequate funding for operations and maintenance, in part due to
weak integration of recurrent costs of donor projects in fiscal policy and budgets.
Basic completion review and evaluation: reliance on donors to undertake reviews and evaluations of
their projects. Otherwise, little or no systematic basic post-project review, let alone evaluation, and
little systematic use made of findings from donor evaluations to ­improve future project design and
implementation.

known—was considered the world’s richest
and most productive colony. It was also reputed to be the most violent, with the majority of its population working as slaves
in plantations (Acemoglu and Robinson
2012; Dubois 2013). Brutal punishments
were common, and slaves died at staggering rates. In 1804, Haiti emerged from
13 years of revolution as the second nation
in the Western Hemisphere to attain independence from a European colonial power
(after the United States).
Independence did not lead, however, to
the development of inclusive institutions.
The country’s successful revolt left the new
­republic isolated on the international stage,
as evidenced by the early lack of diplomatic
recognition from Europe and the United
States. This had a negative impact on the
willingness of foreigners to invest in Haiti.
It is also argued that there were insufficient
checks and balances on the power of postindependence leaders who set themselves
up as a new elite, exploiting Haiti’s people
through the very means as the French had
earlier. Furthermore, to gain recognition,
Haiti had to agree to compensate France for
the property losses faced by colonial planters during Haiti’s revolution (1791–1804).
Payments began in 1825 and only stopped
122 years later, in 1947, draining the economy of much needed capital.
An elite, often of foreign descent, build
important economic interests. Beginning in
the mid-nineteenth century, Haiti’s economy
had grown increasingly dependent on imports, and wealth was accumulating in the
families of importers. With looser restrictions on foreign merchants in the mid-1840s,
migrants primarily from Britain, France and
Germany began to establish themselves on
the island to meet the demand for European
14

goods. The migrants typically stayed in Haiti
as resident aliens to maintain the protection
of foreign governments, but often married
into elite Haitian society to circumvent restrictions on foreign ownership of Haitian
property (Plummer 1988). These families
of mixed Haitian and European descent
were followed beginning in the 1890s by
Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. By the
early turn of last century, these immigrants
owned the major trading houses, as well as
transportation and communication systems
(Plummer 1988).
From the beginning of the twentieth
century, autocratic leaders in Haiti have
traded political support from the elite for
economic advantages to this elite. During
the 1910s, presidents began floating domestic loans that were largely subscribed
by the foreign commercial community
(Rotberg 1971). Plummer (1988) writes
that “merchant-bankers had to cooperate
with official requests for funds if they
wished to continue conducting business
unhindered, but they were frequently rewarded for their pains by favors at the customhouses.” François Duvalier (‘Papa Doc’)
continued this tradition of cutting deals
with the economic elite. In 1958, for instance, following a first abortive coup attempt, Duvalier demanded “displays of
loyalty—especially from wealthy businessmen, who made the first of many special
contributions to the defense of the realm”
(Rotberg 1971). The practice was continued in the early 1960s, when Haiti was simultaneously hit by an economic slump
and cut off from U.S. aid. “Foreign-owned
companies and men of wealth with important stakes in the country shared the ­burden:
they were encouraged to contribute to the
stability of the regime by subscribing to
Country Profile

national bonds, government lotteries”
(Rotberg 1971).
In return, statutory monopolies and exclusivities were usually granted for cooperative economic elites. A long list of industries
­became monopolies by presidential decree
during the 1950s and 1960s: “mineral and
petroleum exploration and exploitation, the
construction and operation of television
stations, the planting and processing of sesame, the processing of guano, the manufacture of ­chocolate, a fertilizer industry, the
development of casinos and hotels, the construction of a sugar factory, the improvement of the telephone system…” (Rotberg
1971). By 1985, some 19 families held almost exclusive rights to import many of
the most commonly consumed products
in Haiti, as detailed in table 1.1. Another
twenty to thirty families held import ­licenses
for another 92 items (Fass 1990). Though
publicly available information on privately
held businesses is limited and import quotas
has been dismantled, many of the same elite
families who dominated the Haitian economy during the era of Duvalier in the 1970s
remain in control of large segments of the
economy today.
Against this backdrop, the structure of
the private sector shows signs of high degrees of concentration, hampering the
entry of new actors. The established private
sector is dominated by a number of families, resulting in high concentration in a
number of key industries, distorted competition, and non-transparent business practices in many instances. In practice, this
translates into limited opportunities for a
substantial expansion of the ­formal private
sector across most sectors. Few of Haiti’s
established private firms have modern
­capital and governance structures with
Country Profile

professional management, limiting their
access to long-term financing.
The open institutions needed to create a
level playing field for economic actors and
underpin a rule of law based on impersonal
exchanges have not emerged. To prosper,
economies need institutional arrangements
to resolve disputes among firms, citizens,
and governments, to clarify ambiguities in
laws and regulations, and to enforce compliance (World Bank 1998). A State needs to
use its coercive power to enforce property
rights at low cost without abusing it and
­exploiting its citizens in order to develop
mechanisms to enforce effectively impersonal agreements (North 2010).4 In such
agreements, an economic operator’s decision
to transact is independent of his partner’s
personal past history. It is made without
knowledge of that partner’s past conduct,
or the expectation of future transaction with
him or her, or the ability to report misconduct to future trading partners (Greif 2006).
In particular, mechanisms of arbitration are
required to settle possible disputes between
traders and ensure contract enforcement.
The inability of the Haitian State to manage
its power appropriately has not allowed the
emergence of these mechanisms and the established private sector had little incentive to
create a level playing field that would have
primarily favored new entrants.
In the absence of effective contract enforcement, economic operators tend to remain within their family or social networks.
Without effective legal systems making low
cost enforcement of contracts possible,
­operators have to rely on personal knowledge, reputation, or the possibility of some
form of retaliation in selecting their business ­partners. Family, ethnic or social networks have been shown to be able to impose

effective informal sanctions and enforce contracts in weak institutional environments,
and thereby foster economic transactions
that would ­otherwise not take place (Greif
1989, 1993; Rauch 2001). Empirically, the
presence of migrant networks, for instance,
has been shown to compensate for the lack
of good ­institutions and is associated with
greater ­international trade (Ehrhart et al.
2014). While these relationships are useful,
they are not conducive to greater inclusion.
This ­social organization tends to undermine
collective action by providing alternative,
non-­collective avenues for ensuring individual and family survival.
As a result, competition is perceived as
low in Haiti. According to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2014–15, Haiti ranks
low in terms of competition: Haiti ranks 140th
out of 148 countries in terms of intensity of
local competition and ranks 140th in terms
of extent of market dominance (a high rank

Figure 1.2
2014–15

indicates few firms dominate key markets)
(figure 1.2). This suggests that in Haiti, prices,
availability and quality of goods and services
are perceived to be determined by a small
number of firms rather than by market mech­
a­nisms and that these incumbent firms appear to face little competitive pressure from
new entrants or smaller domestic firms. This
situation could be the result of high legal or
behavioral entry barriers in the market that
prevent new competitors from participating
in key markets. These market structures
could facilitate tacit agreements among families/groups to allocate markets among themselves, which may harm productivity and
incentive to innovate.
Weak competition contributes to a high
degree of operational business risk. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s operational risk model (2013), investors in
Haiti perceive that the risks associated with
discriminatory policies favoring

incumbents and unfair business practices
are higher than in other countries in the
­Caribbean region and only comparable to
those in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (figure 1.3). The sources of these risks
are mainly related to: a) price control and
the control of other market variables that
both limit the benefits that firms could obtain by competing effectively and harm the
incentives to invest; and b) vested interest
and discrimination against foreign firms
that appear to play the most important role
in generating distortions of the level-playing
field, hinder innovation, and preclude more
efficient firms from competitively gaining
market shares.

Trade data seem to confirm these perceptions about limited competition. According to a product market concentration
analysis based on available import data
(see box 1.2), Haiti imports most of its
final products and most of the imported
goods sold in Haiti are provided by few
large firms. About 70 percent of total imports in value are in goods whose markets
are either highly or moderately concentrated according to common thresholds
used by the U.S. Department of Justice and
Federal Trade Commission (­figure 1.4).
While market concentration is not unusual
given the size of the economy, high and
stable market shares (above 40–50 percent
of the market) may increase the potential
risks of firm abusive behavior with negative
impact on consumers. Highly concentrated
product markets (representing around 40
percent of imports with a HerfindahlHirschman Index [HHI] exceeding 2,500)
include petroleum, food and consumer
goods markets (telephone sets, motorcycles). Imported goods in moderately concentrated markets (representing another 30
percent of imports with an HHI between
1,500 and 2,500) include food, consumer
goods (electric generating sets, motor
­vehicles) and cement.
The concentrated nature of the Haitian
market may be leading to higher consumer
prices. The market analysis aims at detecting the market characteristics that favor
the existence of market power and its potential risks in terms of abusive practices.
For instance, the risk of potential anticompetitive behavior given high market concentration may translate into high prices
for consumers, which may be particularly
damaging in Haiti where more than half of
the population lives on less than US$2 per
Country Profile

BOX 1.2

Product Market Concentration Analysisa

An analysis of product market concentration was conducted jointly between the World Bank and
the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Haiti with the collaboration of a team of
researchers from Harvard and Columbia Universities.
The analysis was based on Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (HHI), calculated using customs import data based on the Harmonized Coding System (HS) disaggregated at a four-digit level. The
HS is a multipurpose international product nomenclature developed by the World Customs
Organization.
The HHI is a commonly accepted measure of market concentration based on market share estimates for each firm in the market. It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in a market (showing the relative space they occupy in the specific market being analyzed),
and then summing up the resulting numbers for the fifty largest firms (or overall firms if the industry counts fewer than fifty companies). The HHI is preferred to other concentration measures (such
as concentration ratio) because it accounts for the heterogeneity in the size of the firms in the market, giving more weight to larger firms.
The HHI can range from close to zero to 10,000. The closer a market is to being a monopoly the
higher the HHI. If, for example, there was only one firm in an industry (a monopolist), that firm
would have 100 percent market share, and the HHI would be equal to 10,000 (100^2). Conversely,
if there were thousands of firms competing in an industry, each firm would have nearly 0 percent
market share, and the HH index would be close to zero.
For the purpose of this analysis, the concentration levels based on the Horizontal Merger
Guidelines (U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission) were used. As such, three
HHI levels help identify the characteristics of product market concentration:
• Unconcentrated Markets: HHI below 1,500.
• Moderately Concentrated Markets: HHI between 1,500 and 2,500.
• Highly Concentrated Markets: HHI above 2,500.

Nsimba, and Reginald Surin).

day. Several of the most important food
products in the Haitian consumption basket are sold in concentrated markets. A
preliminary analysis over time of prices for
such products seems to suggest that on average, prices in Haiti are approximately
30–60 percent higher than in other countries from the LAC region, even taking
into account differences in income levels
and purchasing power of the population,

as well as the cost to import containers and
import tariff levels (see appendix A for

government instability. At Independence in
1804, Haiti was at the forefront of history,
being the first nation to abolish slavery.
Since then, however, with some exceptions
such as of the 30-year period of autocratic
rule under Francois Duvalier (Papa Doc)
and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier (Baby
Doc) (1957–86), Haiti has known a succession of short-lived governments.
Lacking sufficiently long periods of stability, the country has struggled to develop
the institutional mechanisms and policy
fundamentals essential to economic
development.
20

The past decade has been nevertheless
comparatively stable. Over the past ten years,
with security provided by a large United
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), two presidents have been chosen
by election and the current President, Michel
Martelly, was the first to accede to the Presidency by election from a party in the opposition. However, stability remains fragile,
with frequent changes in government and
­repeated delays in electoral calendars. Such
delays led to the lapsing of Parliament in
­
January 2015, leaving the executive to try to
broker a deal with the opposition and agree
Country Profile

on a transitional government who would organize elections.
The distribution of resources seems to
feed grievances. From the early days of independence until the end of the nineteenth
century, almost all of Haiti’s heads of state
granted land to the military and to high profile civil servants, stripping peasants of their
land rights (Dubois 2013). As a result of this
history, calls for and conflicts over land redistribution repeatedly emerge as a source of
instability and uncertainty, with serious consequences for growth. Many observers agree
that Haitians perceive political and economic
disputes as a zero sum game with only winners and losers, each with very long
memories.
Grievances lead to conflicts. Distributional conflicts arguably have as a corollary
inhibited the development of social capital
and hampered the building of trust within
Haitian society further preventing agreement
across groups and the emergence of social
cohesion at the national level. Disenfranchised and without effective channels to
voice needs and demands, citizens have
taken to the streets in protest, sometimes
­violently. The Bank’s 1998 Poverty Report
noted “the absence of a culture of democratic
decision making and peaceful consensus
building … has generated tensions…and
hampered Haiti’s rehabilitation effort.” While
violent airing of grievances in Haiti’s early
history generally took place in the rural
areas, contemporary unrest tends to break
out in the cities, reflecting the country’s demographic evolution and urbanization over
the years.
Violence in turn hampers economic opportunities. A report on governance and social justice in the Caribbean (Dollar 2000)
argued that Haiti is an “extreme case of a
Country Profile

country caught in a vicious circle in which
unemployment, inequality, and poor education feed into lawlessness and violence,
making it difficult for the economy to grow
and create jobs, thus perpetuating unemployment and inequality.” For instance, the
political turmoil of the late 1980s and 1990s,
coupled with a US embargo, severely depressed Haiti’s exports. Exports of assembled electronic goods virtually disappeared
and never recovered. External aid flows
have also been highly volatile, responding
to political events. All of these elements
have negatively affected employment of a
very young, and increasingly urbanized and
disenfranchised population, the level of
public investments, and the overall sustainability of the social and political situation in
the country.

Natural Disasters
The Haitian population is one of the most
exposed in the world to natural disasters—
hurricanes, floods and earthquakes.6 Haiti
has a higher number of disasters per km2
than the average of the Caribbean countries
(table 1.2). In 2008, tropical storms and hurricanes caused losses estimated at 15 percent
of GDP. The earthquake on January 12, 2010
killed 220,000 people, displaced 1.5 million
people, and destroyed the equivalent of 120
percent of GDP. These disasters tend to affect
disproportionally the poorest and marginal
pop­u­lations settling in flood zones and
coastal areas, in particular in the case of
tropical storms where almost 50 percent of
damages and losses to the productive sectors
have been concentrated in the agricultural
sector.7 Overall, based on available historic
data, weather-related disasters are estimated
to have caused damages and losses

amounting to about 2 percent of GDP on average per year during 1975–2012.8
Moreover, the effects of these natural
disasters are much larger in Haiti, indicating higher vulnerability and institutional
weaknesses. While Haiti appears to be
somewhat more exposed to natural hazards than some countries in the Caribbean, it is also more vulnerable. Even
when the earthquake of 2010 is excluded
from the statistics, the number of casualties to the population is very large, similar only to Honduras and Nicaragua
(table 1.2). In Haiti, population density and
lack of coping capacity have translated into
large numbers of people affected by natural
disasters ­(figure 1.5). In this regard, the
comparison between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, both sharing the same island, is instructive. The number of
weather-related disasters from 1971 to
2014 has been more than double in Haiti
than in the Dominican Republic, mostly
22

because Haiti experienced more than twice
as many floods, as a consequence of a
storm, and three times the number of
drought periods than the Dominican Republic. Floods are one of the most common weather-related events that affect
Haiti and are partly related to the country’s
severe deforestation. Haiti’s greater vulnerability is reflected in the consequences of
these events in terms of losses, both
human and economic, reflecting the inadequacy of drainage, large populations settling in flood zones, and the lack of sound
buildings or building codes.

Migration
In this unfavorable environment, migration has become a key avenue for Haitians
seeking a better life. Substantial internal migration is taking place, particularly from
rural to urban areas, as people seek better
economic opportunities and better services.

In addition, for both political and economic
reasons, large numbers of Haitians have emigrated throughout the twentieth century
building an important diaspora (figure 1.6).
A vast majority of Haitians who continue to
emigrate now seem to do so because they
cannot find work opportunities in Haiti
Orozco (2006). They move mostly to the
United States, the Dominican Republic,
­Canada and France ­(figure 1.7).9 According
to the Global Bilateral Migration Matrix, one
million Haitians were estimated to be living
abroad in 2010. About 540,000 of those
were in the United States, 280,000 in the

42,000 in France.11
This large diaspora is a source of significant remittances. Remittances received by
Haiti represent a large share of GDP, the
­largest share among LAC countries, and the
fourth highest in the world in terms of export
earnings (figure 1.8). For every year in the
period 2000–09, remittances were larger
than official development assistance (ODA),
foreign direct investment (FDI) and the total
exports of goods and services (­figure 1.9).12
­Despite the sharp increase in development
assistance in the year after the earthquake,
in 2012, remittances once again surpassed development assistance, representing the equivalent of 20.4 percent of GDP vs. 16.1 percent

of GDP for ODA, 13.2 percent of GDP for exports and 2 percent of GDP for FDI.
Remittances are, however, predominantly
an urban phenomenon and migrants tend to
be better educated. Emigration is relatively
costly and accessible mainly to urban and
wealthier families. While for the country as
a whole, about a third of all households receive remittances, this share reaches over 35
percent for urban households and drops to
20 percent for households in rural areas.
­Migrants tend also to be better educated,
representing an important “brain drain.”13
Overall, the profile of Haitian migrants
is very similar to those of the average
­Caribbean migrant. However, individuals
with advanced education represent only 3

compared for example to almost 20 percent
in the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. These figures suggest that over 45
percent of Haitians with a college degree
currently live outside of the country.14
Remittances have tended to finance the
consumption of foreign goods. Remittances represent an important source of
livelihood, amounting to about 20 percent
of household income. Controlling for a set
of household characteristics, remittances
have been shown to be positively associated with higher expenditure on food,
­e ducation and health. 15 On the
­macro-economic level, however, data

Figure 1.9 Foreign Flows,

would suggest that this ­c onsumption falls
mainly on imports. The continuous increase in remittances—and aid—observed
over the past has been associated with an
expansion of imports and a widening of
the trade deficit, making Haiti one of the
countries that import the most in terms of
GDP ­(figures 1.10 and 1.11). ­Import increased from about 30 percent of GDP in
the early 1980s to more than 50 percent in
the early 2010s, largely consumption goods
financed by international aid and remittances. Major items imported by Haiti are
food (representing around 35 percent
of total imports over the past decade),
­manufactured goods (around 18 percent

There is limited evidence to inform

Capacity Indicator (SCI), a composite index

that takes into account statistical methodology, source data and periodicity, Haiti
ranks below comparator countries (figure

that has resulted from surveys such as the
Demographic and Health Survey (MSPP,
IHE, and ICF International 1994, 2000,

recent years data provision has serious
shortcomings that severely hamper IMF
surveillance (IMF 2014a). The most affected areas are the national accounts, fiscal data, and external sector statistics. In
particular, constant price GDP data are
still being ­published using a base year of
1986–87, which does not adequately reflect the structural economic changes resulting from the various civil conflicts
and natural disasters Haiti has experienced
over the recent decades, and thus introduce major uncertainty in policy analysis.
Equally problematic are estimates of the

Notes
1. Haiti has traditionally enjoyed substantial preferential market access to the United
States and Canada, but has not succeeded in
fully exploiting this advantage. For example, the country has not been able to fill its
quota for exports to the United States under
the Hemispheric Opportunities through
Partnership Encouragement II (HOPE II)
initiative or under the Haiti Economic Lift
Program (HELP) Act. These laws allow Haiti
to assemble textiles, whatever the origin of the
imported fabrics, and to export them to the
United States duty free and tax free but are due
to end in 2020, unless renewed.

greater inclusion, see for instance Narayan,
Chanduvi, and Tiwari (2013).

traders, which ultimately provided the essential
institutions for impersonal exchange, and the
practice of the Mahgribi (Jewish merchants but
in a Muslim culture), who fail to make the necessary institutional adjustments and lose out in
the competitive trade of the Mediterranean.

According to the probabilistic model used by
the CCRIF, tropical cyclones cause an estimated US$118 million in damages each year,
which is equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP for
2013, while earthquake-related damages average US$26 million each year (0.31 percent of
GDP in 2013). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk

14. This estimate considers the share of college-educated residents from ECVMAS
2012; OECD data for education attainment of ­migrants as of 2010–2011 and estimates for education of Haitians living in
the Dominican Republic. Niimi and Ozden
(2006), based on data from Docquier and
Marfouk (2006) and Barro and Lee (2000),
reported that 80 percent of Haiti born people with college degrees lived abroad as of
2000. This result is driven by the estimates
that only 0.7 percent of Haiti residents had
college degree in that year.
15. Econometric analyses carried out for the 2014
Poverty Assessment tend to show that a 10
percent increase in remittances would be associated with an 8–13 percent increase in spending on education and health, and a 5 percent
increase in food expenditures.

Haiti is imported.

Country Profile

2. Trends and Profile in Poverty and
Shared Prosperity1
Trends
Recent findings would suggest that extreme poverty has declined in Haiti over the
past decade (figure 2.1). Extreme poverty
decreased in Haiti from 31 percent in 2000
to 24 percent in 2012 (World Bank and
ONPES 2014).2 Progress was mainly concentrated in urban areas, however. The share of
extreme poor has declined from 21 percent
to 12 percent and from 20 percent to 5 percent in other urban and metropolitan areas,
respectively, while it has stagnated in rural
areas.3 This trend is confirmed by both monetary and non-monetary poverty indicators,
with the biggest non-monetary progress
recorded in education (table 2.1). All schoolage children go now to school in about 90
percent of the households compared to
about 80 percent in 2001. Immunization
rates are also up. While data is not available
to assess trends in moderate consumption
poverty, it is also expected to have improved
in the last decade.
Poverty remains, however, endemic in
Haiti and varies widely. Haiti is the poorest
country in Latin America and among the
poorest in the world in terms of per capita
GDP and human development.4 The overall
poverty headcount amounts to about 59 percent and extreme poverty to 24 percent in
2012, indicating that almost 6.3 million
Haitians cannot meet their basic needs and
2.5 million cannot even cover food needs.5
Geographically, poverty and extreme poverty
are considerably higher in rural areas. More
than 80 percent of the extreme poor live in
Trends and Profile in Poverty and Shared Prosperity

rural areas, where 38 percent of the population is not able to satisfy its nutritional needs,
compared to 12 percent in urban areas and 5
percent in metropolitan areas (i.e., the capital
city). The poorest regions are the furthest
from the capital city and the most isolated.
The poorest departments are geographically
concentrated in the northern region of the
country where the extreme poverty rate exceeds 40 percent in the North East and North
West, compared to 5 percent in metropolitan
area of Port-­au-Prince (map 2.1).
Furthermore, income inequality is the
highest in the region and has widened in
rural areas. The Gini coefficient stagnated at
about 0.6 between 2001 and 2012. This result hides, however, important regional disparities: while inequality widened in rural
areas (from 0.49 to 0.56), it narrowed in
urban areas (from 0.64 to 0.59). Preliminary
evidence would suggest that increases in
labor income and private transfers could
have contributed to the narrowing of inequality in urban areas. On the other hand,
the contraction in agricultural production
caused by ­repeated weather-related shocks
could explain the widening of inequality in
rural areas, reducing earnings for agricultural labor and increasing the prices of food,
both factors affecting the poorest disproportionately. As a result, in 2012 the top one
percent of the population lived on almost
50 times the resources of the bottom 10 percent.6 This result makes Haiti the most unequal country in Latin America and one of
the most unequal in the world.

Despite improvements in access to basic
services since 2001, the poor still face significantly larger barriers. Poverty is an important barrier to both school enrollment
and health service utilization, for instance.
According to the most recent household
survey, cost is the main reason for keeping
children out of school or not consulting a
doctor if they are sick in 83 percent and 49
percent of cases, ­respectively.7 As a result, in
2012, while 87 percent of 6- to 14-year-olds
in poor households were in school, this ratio
reached 96 percent for non-poor households. In turn, this more limited access to
education perpetuates poverty: the poor live
in households in which the heads have an
average of three times fewer years of education, and as many as 61 percent of the heads
of poor households are illiterate, compared

with 34 percent among non-poor households (table 2.2). The poorest also have limited access to maternal health services and
are more likely to die during delivery, with
fewer than one woman in ten in the lowest
quintile benefitting from assisted delivery
(compared to seven out of ten among the
better off).8 These obstacles are even greater
in rural areas, where the supply of services
is more limited.
Most of the poor work, but their earnings are insufficient to lift them out of poverty. Almost 70 percent of poor households
have heads holding jobs (against 73 percent
among the non-poor). However, among
the former, 61 percent work in agriculture,
where average earnings are less than 20
percent of the earnings in the formal sector.
Among the remainder, 35 percent work in

the informal sector, where earnings are less
than half those in the formal sector. As a
­result, more than half of poor households
undertake two or more income generating
activities. This underscores the urgent need
to create higher labor productivity jobs.
The poor suffer from poor nutrition early
in life and from food insecurity. Food insecurity is significant in Haiti, at 28 percent nationwide and 34 percent in rural areas.9 Poor
household members are much more likely to
report frequent hunger or lack of food at bed
time relative to members of nonpoor households (­figure 2.2). Households with children
under the age of 5 are much more likely to

experience repeated food shortages World
Bank and ONPES (2014). As a result, onefifth of under-5-year-olds are chronically malnourished (MSPP, IHE, and ICF International
2013). This is a particular cause of concern
because proper nutrition in early life is crucial
for brain development and subsequent life
outcomes (Alderman and King 2006).
The poor in Haiti are particularly vulnerable and access to social safety nets is
limited. A typical Haitian household faces
multiple shocks annually: nearly 75 percent of households suffer economic consequences following a shock (e.g., natural
disaster or health-related). Households in

poverty are even more vulnerable, particularly those in extreme poverty: among poor
households, 95 percent experience at least
one economically damaging shock per year.
The poor and vulnerable have limited access
to public support, given the low capacity of
the State.10 Most assistance arrives to them in
the form of remittances or support from
churches, other nongovernmental institutions, and donors. Despite recent efforts to
expand social assistance provision under the
EDE PÈP framework since 2013, the programs remain too fragmented, too small, and
not targeted enough to make a significant
difference. The majority of the poor continue
to lack access to formal safety nets that could
allow them to smooth their consumption
over time, prevent irreversible loss of human
capital, and avoid destitution.
Coping strategies perpetuate poverty. In
the absence of formal instruments to manage
risk effectively, the poorest households are
34

unable to cope with shocks and adopt coping
strategies that damage human capital.
Overall, 23 percent of households in extreme
poverty changed their nutritional profile in
response to a major shock. In particular, if
the shock hits the entire community, a staggering 56 percent of households in extreme
poverty change their nutritional behavior, as
opposed to 37 percent of resilient households.
The extreme poor are also more likely to remove their children from school, particularly
if the household is experiencing a change in
composition (such as the birth or death of a
household member) or a decline in the monetary support from outside the household,
which is often used to pay school fees.
Women and girls are particularly vulnerable. Although poverty does not differ by
gender, despite sizable progress in both education and health outcomes, adult women
are still less well educated than adult men
and are more likely to be illiterate. Their use
of health services is also still very limited.
Women in Haiti are also significantly less
likely to be employed and earn significantly
less than men (box 2.1). Finally, ­­gender-based
violence and low participation in the public
sphere are widespread in Haiti.

Drivers
Recent findings suggest that the decline
in extreme poverty was partly driven by
­rising non-agricultural labor income. Labor
income increased by about 3½ percent on
average per year, especially among men.
GDP data suggest that the sectors that grew
the most over the recent past were construction, telecommunication and transport, all
concentrated in urban areas, partly explaining the improvements of urban living conditions. As a result, employment probably
Trends and Profile in Poverty and Shared Prosperity

BOX 2.1 Gender Inequalities in Haiti
Women and girls in Haiti still face greater obstacles to attend school. Despite progress in school enrollment among younger cohorts, adult women are still worse educated than adult men and are more
likely to be illiterate. Adult men have, on average, two more years of education than women and are
over 10 percentage points more likely to be literate. Early withdrawal from school can have lifelong
consequences. Underage marriage and teen pregnancy, for instance, represent additional risks for
girls who do not attend school: 17 percent of Haitian women are married in adolescence, compared
with 2 percent of men, this number dropping among girls with higher education (Cicmil 2013).
They deal with greater health challenges. Maternal mortality, at 380 deaths per 100,000 live births, is still
five times higher than the regional average (WHO 2014)a, partly because a high percentage of birth deliveries take place outside a health care facility (65 percent). Poor nutrition is a threat for both children
and mothers: according to the MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 22 percent of children are
stunted or too short for their age, while nearly half of women aged 15–49 have anemia. The prevalence
of HIV/AIDS is higher among women (2.7 percent) than men (1.7 percent), reflecting both knowledge
differentials among other factors: only 15 percent of young women have correct information on how to
prevent sexual HIV transmission compared to 28 percent of young men (Boesten and Poku 2009).
Women are significantly disadvantaged in the labor market. Holding constant several social and demographic characteristics, one finds that women are 20 percentage points more likely than men to
be unemployed and, if working, 6 percentage points more likely to be in the informal sector. Wages
among women are also 32 percent lower than wages among men. Over two-thirds of this difference
is unexplained by observable characteristics, suggesting that discrimination could play a role.
Gender-based violence is widespread. Gender-based violence is a chronic problem: according to the
MSPP, IHE, and ICF International (2013), 13 percent of Haitian women have experienced sexual violence, and 29 percent of women who have ever been married have experienced spousal violence,
whether emotional, physical, or sexual. Vulnerability is particularly high among internally displaced
people in camps and areas affected by the 2010 earthquake: a survey in 2011 indicated that 64 percent
of interviewed pregnant adolescent girls had become pregnant after being raped (PotoFi 2012).
Female participation in the public sphere is low. Only 4 percent of all parliamentary seats were occupied
by women in the most recent legislature, placing Haiti well below the regional average of 26 percent and
among the countries with the lowest rate (136th out of 142 countries). At the national level, as of April
2014, 8 of 23 ministers and 3 of 20 secretaries of state were women.b At the local level, women account
for only 12 percent of all mayors. The government has taken steps to expand women’s representation,
including by creating the Gender Equality Office in Parliament and amending the Constitution to stipulate a quota of at least 30 percent women in all public offices, but enforcement is problematic.

experienced a structural shift over this period towards non-agriculture activities, contributing to better living standards: the
average monthly salaries in the formal or
informal sectors are two to four times
Trends and Profile in Poverty and Shared Prosperity

higher than in the agricultural sector
(ECVMAS, 2012).11
Most of the labor force remains employed in the agriculture and urban informal sectors. Reliable data on employment
35

in Haiti are scarce. Available employment
and household surveys would suggest, nevertheless, that since 2007 the share of formal employment in total employment has
increased by about 3 percentage points,
driven mainly by jobs in the administration and NGOs (figure 2.3).12 Despite this
expansion, formal employment remains
small with agriculture and urban ­informal
sectors still providing most of the employment with about 40 percent and 47 percent of the labor market, respectively
(­f igures 2.4 and 2.5). 13 While wages have
tended to increase in the small formal sector over that period, they have stagnated in
agriculture and in the informal sector, and
overall 70 percent of workers still earn less
than the minimum wage.
The persistence of rural poverty reflects
households’ reliance on a low-performing
agricultural sector. Rural livelihoods are

highly dependent on agriculture: almost
80 percent of households engage in farming.
Moreover, for half the households, farming
is the sole economic activity. Unfortunately,
the returns to agriculture are low and unreliable, and the activity resembles a subsistence
­strategy rather than reliance on a productive economic sector.14 Labor productivity
is particularly low among the poor with
only 20 percent of them using fertilizers
and pesticides. Moreover, even though the
area of cultivated land is only slightly
smaller among the poor than among the
non-poor (1.2 hectares versus 1.6 hectares,
respectively), the poor spend two to four
times less on fertilizers, pesticides, seeds,
and labor. Increased productivity is correlated to greater access and use of inputs,
as well as crop diversification for both poor
and non-poor agricultural households
(World Bank and ONPES 2014).

Participation in the nonfarm sector would
seem critical to emerge from poverty in rural
Haiti. Engaging in the nonfarm ­sector in
rural areas reduces the probability of being
poor by 10 percentage points. The typical
nonfarm job in rural areas is a one- or
two-person shop engaged in small retail.
Although still low paying, this type of activity
yields better returns than those accruing to
farming. About 40 percent of non-poor
households participate in the nonfarm sector,
a participation rate that is 1.5 times higher
than the participation rate among the poor.
Private transfers and international aid,
have also contributed to the decrease in poverty. The percentage of households receiving

private transfers (domestic transfers or remittances from abroad) in Haiti increased from
42 percent to 69 percent between 2000 and
2012. Workers’ transfers from abroad have
represented more than a fifth of Haiti’s GDP
in recent years, and originate mainly from the
United States and the Dominican Republic
(DR). While remittance flows from the U.S.
are larger, transfers from the DR are more
likely to reduce poverty since they tend to
benefit poorer households located in rural
areas. Furthermore, the 2010 earthquake
­resulted in unprecedented aid flows in the
form of money, goods and services. These
­external flows have also contributed in reducing poverty over the period, especially in the

Metropolitan area which attracted most of
the assistance (in large part because Port-auPrince was hit hardest by the earthquake).
In addition to migration abroad, domestic migration is highly prevalent, with a clear
bias towards urban areas. While one million
Haitians are estimated to live abroad (see
Chapter 1), almost two million Haitians have
migrated internally. Indeed, 24 percent of the
population has moved from their place of
birth (compared to 20 percent in 2001).15 In
terms of areas of residence, it is clear that the
flow of migrants has an urban bias, and especially the Aire Metropolitaine. Over half of
the current population of the Metropolitan
area is composed of migrants, against less
than 30 percent in other urban areas and less
than 10 percent in rural settings (figure 2.6).
In terms of departments, 65 percent of the
total migrant population now resides in the
Ouest, followed by 9 percent in Artibonite
and 8 percent in the Nord. This pattern suggests the attraction of migrants to urban centers: Gonaïves in Artibonite and Cap Haitian
in the North are the two largest centers after
Port-au-Prince.

Migrating, both domestically and abroad,
seems to be a profitable income generation
solution for many households. In many developing countries, households turn to migration
as a way to increase available income, in a
context of limited economic opportunities or
returns to education. In particular, the decision of a household to educate or send one of
its members abroad can be seen as an investment: families incur upfront costs (such as education fees, transport tickets, seed money,
network mobilization, visa) in order to reap
future income gains from better labor opportunities.16 Data suggests a strong link between
schooling and mobility in Haiti (­figure 2.7). If
the initial costs of international migration
are too high for poorer households, moving
within the country represents a second-best
option: when controlling for individual and
households characteristics, educated migrants

40 (from 10 to 15 percent in the first quintile
and from 7 to 12 percent in the second).
Private transfers are associated with lower
poverty levels. Since over 60 percent of poor
and extreme poor households rely on some
kind of transfers, excluding those has a sizeable effect on poverty headcounts.19 If private
transfers were to stop flowing, extreme poverty would increase 5 points (from 23.8 percent to 28.9 percent), and moderate poverty
would rise 4 percentage points (from 58.5
percent to 63 percent). As poor households
have less access to remittances, excluding
them from the total budget has a smaller impact on poverty rates: extreme poverty rises
to 25.4 percent and moderate poverty to 60.3
percent.20 Some regions like the South East
or the South benefit particularly from private
domestic transfers, while in the North, the
North East, and the Nippes remittances from
abroad play a greater role in reducing poverty (figure 2.8).

in urban areas earn on average between 20
and 30 percent more than their counterparts
in rural areas.17
People have been moving to urban areas
also to seek better public services. The State
being absent in many places outside the main
urban centers (as discussed in Chapter 1), people have been migrating to the Metropolitan
areas and to other urban areas to seek better
access to services. Although, the quality of
­sanitation remains low (only 31 percent of the
population had access in 2012 to improved
sanitation), the ratio for rural areas is even
much lower (16 percent).18 Access to improved sources of drinking water is similar in
urban and rural areas, at 55 and 52 percent,
­respectively. However, most of the remainder
of the urban population (36 percent) purchases safe water directly from vendors, while
most of the remainder of the rural population
(44 percent) does not have this option and
uses unimproved water sources (river water
or unprotected wells) with a high probability
of contamination. Access to energy (electricity, solar, or generators) expanded only
slightly because of gains in urban areas,
­accompanied by stagnating levels in rural
areas, which remained at 11 percent.
Private transfers have played an important role in supporting households’ income
in Haiti. Larger private transfers coming
from domestic and international migrants
have played a significant role in raising income in urban areas, together with more
nonagricultural employment opportunities.
The share of private transfers in total household income has increased from 20 to 42
percent in the first and from 15 to 20 percent
in the second quintile of the income distribution. In rural areas, where poverty has
stagnated and inequality increased, the share
of private transfers also rose for the bottom

1. All statistics in this section come from
ECVMAS 2012 and ECVH 2001, unless otherwise indicated.
2. Pedersen and Lockwood (2001) based on the
1999/2000 Budget and Consumption Survey.
As a point of comparison, Azevedo et al.
(2013) studies 16 countries having substantially reduced poverty over broadly a decade,
ranging from a 10 percentage points decline
(Costa Rica) to more than 40 percentage
points (Romania).
3. Although not completely comparable, the
monetary poverty indicator from 2000 was
calculated using a methodology similar to the
new official one, including the use of a national
food poverty line against per capita household
consumption. The reduction in consumption
poverty is also confirmed by trends in nonmonetary well-being indicators. Income based
measures of moderate poverty suggest that
it declined from 77 percent in 2001 (ECVH
2001) to 72 percent in 2012 (ECVMAS 2012).
Consumption based poverty measures are
considered the most accurate in capturing
welfare levels, especially in countries with high
levels of rural poverty and significant income
volatility. The new official Haitian poverty
measure is consumption based.
4. Haiti’s GDP per capita amounted to US$1,575
(PPP) in 2013 and ranked 161 out of 186 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index.
5. These rates are based on per capita consumption and were calculated using the 2012 official
Haitian moderate and extreme poverty lines of
82.2 HTG (US$1.98) and 41.7 HTG (US$1),
respectively.
6. Based on per capita income data.
7. According to the 2012 demographic and
health survey ([DHS] MSPP, IHE, and ICF
International 2013), 7 in 10 women aged
15–49 years do not seek medical support for
lack of money, while 43 percent do not do so
for lack of transport (see chapter 3).
8. In 2012, the coverage of deliveries within institutions was 8.4 times greater among the highest income quintile (76 percent) than among
the lowest quintile (9 percent).

9. According to the National Food Security
Coordination Unit, the food insecurity rate
was 28 percent nationwide and 48 percent in
rural areas in 2011. To measure food insecurity,
the unit uses a composite indicator composed
of both quantitative and qualitative measures.
The numbers contained in this chapter, on the
other hand, refer exclusively to the food security indicator of the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations, which is
based on food intake.
10. Only about 8 percent of the Haitian population received non-contributory social assistance benefits (such as scholarship, food aid,
or other transfer) in 2012 (World Bank and
ONPES 2014).
11. The informal sector is defined by the
International Labor Organization as unincorporated enterprises (household businesses)
that are not registered, do not keep formal
accounts, and are not in the primary sector
(agriculture).
12. The increase in the share of employment in
agriculture stems from a rise in family aid.
The intuition would be that in dire times,
young people and women who would not have
worked were called into the labor force.
13. The private informal sector in figure 2.5 includes non-farm self-employment, non-farm
business owners, and the informal non-farm
wage work in figure 2.6.
14. Since 2000, the sector has performed poorly,
contracting by 0.6 percent annually as a consequence of repeated adverse climatic shocks.
In 2012, agricultural production narrowed
by 1.3 percent following a series of droughts,
heavy rains, and hurricanes, which generated
crop and seasonal income losses of 40–80
percent. See “Haiti Food Security Outlook”

16. Clemens (2011) estimates that unskilled
Haitian farmers migrating to the US could
increase their annual incomes by a factor
of 20.
17. Clemens (2014) gathers evidence that migration tends to increase with income until
a certain threshold, suggesting that poorer
households would like to migrate, but do not
have the means to afford it.
18. Improved sanitation includes flush toilets and improved latrines. According to
the United Nations Children’s Fund and
the World Health Organization, an improved sanitation latrine is one that hygienically separates human excreta from human
contact.

19. Official poverty rates are based on consumption, not on income. The exercise above
consists on subtracting transfers from total
consumption and recalculating poverty rates,
thus relying on the assumption that households consume all of income received from
transfers (no savings).
20. Acosta et al. (2006) use the 2011 ECVH to
estimate the effect of remittances on poverty. Using an income-based welfare measure
and the international poverty lines of U$1
and U$2 a day for extreme and moderate
poverty, respectively, they find that excluding
­remittances increased extreme poverty from
53 percent to 60 percent and moderate poverty
from 71 percent to 76 percent.

3. Trends and Drivers of Growth
Trends
Overall, Haiti’s growth performance in
the last four decades has been disappointing.
From 1971 to 2013, GDP growth averaged 1.2
percent a year, much lower than the average of
the LAC region (3.5 percent) and the average
of economies at the same level of development (3.3 percent) (­figure 3.1). The few periods of positive growth were short-lived, often
followed by a contraction in economic activity.
Furthermore, in light of the country’s important demographic growth, the level of GDP per
capita even fell by 0.7 percent per year on
­average between 1971 and 2013. While Haiti’s
GDP per capita has expanded in line with the
average of LAC during the 1970’s, it has lost
ground ever since (figure 3.2). Even low income
countries (LIC) have on average seen their
GDP per capita taking off since the mid-1990s,
leaving Haiti behind.
Haiti’s growth has been largely driven by
an expanding labor force. Looking at the factor decomposition of Haiti’s growth, one notices that labor has been the main driver of the
country’s economic expansion (table 3.1).
Increases in life expectancy and reductions of
fertility rates (from 5.7 births/woman in 1971
to 3.2 in 2012) have contributed to the increase
in the share of the working age population:
population ages 15–64 represented in 2012
59 percent of the total population, up from
54 percent in 1971. Capital accumulation, although timid for most of the period, has been
picking up since 2000. Even if overestimated,
capital accumulation is likely to have been lifted
by the re-engagement of ­donors and the aid
flows following the 2010 earthquake to r­ ebuild

Trends and Drivers of Growth

lost infrastructure.1 Access to concessional
borrowing has also ­financed a higher level of
public investment (box 3.1).
The economy’s performance has, ­however,
been held back by negative productivity
shocks. Real GDP growth in Haiti during the
period was disappointing, despite ­increases in
the factors of production, implying negative
total factor productivity (TFP). This negative
con­tribution could ­reflect the natural disasters
and political instability Haiti has experienced.2
Only during a limited period of time after the
­return to democracy (1995–99), growth in TFP
was positive. During these episodes, improvements in productivity could have stemmed
from the reallocation of factors towards economic sectors with higher productivity, higher
“quality” of inputs (labor and capital) or the
adoption of new technologies (IMF 2004).
Natural disasters have indeed hampered
Haiti’s economic performance over the last
forty years. Between 1971 and 2013, Haiti’s
economy has been subjected to numerous
shocks with adverse effects on growth. While
natural disasters have occurred almost every
year during this period (­figure 3.3), the extent of the economic consequences depends
on the nature of the disasters: the effects of
floods tend to be limited to certain areas, with
fewer people affected, while those of hurricanes tend to be more widespread (­figure 3.4).
In 2008, for instance, Haiti was hit by four
hurricanes, causing a contraction in agricultural production by more than 7 percent.
The 2010 earthquake was also destructive
and led to a significant loss of human life
and displacements, as well as damage to

leading to negative growth of 1.3 percent in
the agricultural sector.
Political instability has also taken a toll
on growth. The departure of Jean Claude
­Du­valier initiated a period of intense political instability in Haiti (figure 3.5). Between
44

1986 and 2014 the country had 18 changes of
president and important changes in regime
(table 3.2). In ad­dition, according to the CrossNational Time Series data archive, there were
20 major cabinet changes in Haiti from 1986 to
2006 (meaning a change of Prime minister or
50 percent of the cabinet posts are assumed
by new ministers). Empirical investigations
have shown that such cabinet changes are

Petrocaribe and Haiti

The Petrocaribe initiative, created in 2005, has 18 members.a The agreement aims to promote
cooperation among state energy operators, in terms of technology, energy policy, joint exploration,
refining, sales and investment in the energy sector. The most relevant aspect of the Petrocaribe
agreement is the stable supply of oil from Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela to other members,
at favorable financing conditions. Through the agreement, Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela
commits to providing oil to the members based on quotas established bilaterally at international
market prices. Haiti joined the initiative in March 2007 and started benefiting from the agreement
in October 2007, with a quota of 14 thousand barrels per day (b/d). However, only a fraction of the
bill needs to be paid in cash, the remaining is financed on concessional terms.

The sale of these oil products in the domestic market creates considerable resources for
the government. Since 2008, the Petrocaribe flows have amounted cumulatively to
25 percent of GDP. An autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance (the Bureau de
Monétisation du Programme d’Aide au Développement, BMPAD) manages these resources
on behalf of the Haitian government. BMPAD plays an intermediary role between Haitian
fuel purchasers and the Venezuelan supplier.
Petrocaribe resources have been used to finance investment and social projects, as well as
support the electricity sector. Whenever the government decides that new projects will be
financed using these resources, it publishes a resolution listing these projects and the
amounts to be financed in the official gazette. Disbursements into the projects are reported in BMPAD’s webpage on a regular basis. These projects suffer nevertheless from
the same shortcomings than the rest of the Public Investment Program, notably a lack of
proper assessment, prioritization and monitoring (see box 1.1). A recent audit of these investments by the CSCCA highlights serious shortcomings in the procurement and supervision of contracts, including over-priced infrastructure and abandoned projects.

from 5.1 to 10.2 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.4,5 Crim­inal activity has been especially widespread near the industrial areas of
Port-au-Prince and in urban slums, forcing
businesses to absorb high security costs and
periodically shut down or move their operations. The effects of violence are felt most
deeply on the most vulnerable members of
the population. Residents of poor, marginalized neighborhoods are 40 times more likely
to be murdered than other urban dwellers.
These events have significantly reshaped
the structure of the Haitian economy over the
last four decades. The US embargo (1991–94)
triggered a strong decline in manufacturing
(figure 3.6). This sector represented 18 percent
of GDP in 1990, shrunk to 10 percent in 1994

when the embargo ended, and never returned
to pre-embargo levels afterwards.6 In the beginning of the 1970, agriculture was the most
important sector, representing almost 40 per­
cent of the value added, but fell to less than
20 percent in 2012. Authors have argued that
the embargo, because it hampered access to
important inputs such as seeds, contributed
to the decline of productivity in the sector
(IICA 1997). High fragmentation of land, low
levels of technology applied in the sector, and
soil deterioration have also constrained agricultural produc­tivity. As seen above, the sector is also very vulnerable to natural disasters.
Some of those factors have also contributed
to the great volatility in the contribution of
the agricultural sector to GDP growth while

construction and services have been more
steady drivers of growth, especially since the
earthquake. (figure 3.7).
The decline of agriculture has been accompanied by an acceleration of urbanization
(figure 3.8). An increase in population con­
centration in the cities has also pushed the
demand for services. Together, the activities
of transport and communication, commerce
and other services currently represent almost
half of the value added in Haiti. Another sector that has risen in importance is construction, also driven by urbanization. Growth in
construction was the main driver of the rise
in the share of secondary activities in GDP.

political stability after the low-point of 2004
came with an improvement in a number of
governance indicators (figure 3.10). The implementation of the Automated System for
Customs Data (ASCUYDA) was stepped up,
for instance, after the earthquake.7 Indicators

for control of corruption, rule of law, government effectiveness, as well as voice and accountability have all registered improvements
in Haiti over that period, although remaining low compared to the average of the LAC
region and to that of low-income economies

(figure 3.9). Haiti still ranks lowest in the region in control of corruption or government
effectiveness.
In particular, a real property cadaster and
land registry system is needed. Less than five
percent of Haiti’s land has been surveyed,
and more than 75 percent of rural land contracts are drawn up according to traditional
procedures and are not officially registered.
The situation is just as complicated in urban
areas. The courts are clogged by numerous
land disputes. Increased legal security of
land rights is essential to protect both individual households and investors (who hesitate to engage in investment projects that
might end up being challenged in court),
and to develop and maintain a real estate
market. Several attempts have been made at
the national level to develop a registry system, without success.
Access to finance is challenging for both,
households and medium- and small-sized enterprises. The very small number of
branches and service points of formal
­institutions in the country (6.35/100,000
52

inhabitants) results in a low level of usage of
financial services. Today, only 27 percent of
all adults in Haiti have an account at a formal
financial institution (compared with 45
percent in LAC). Coupled with limited credit
information availability, unclear property
rights and weak contract enforcement, access to credit is problematic, particularly
for small- and medium-sized enterprises, limiting their capacity of taking advantage of opportunities, growing their operations and
generating employment. Furthermore,
competition to provide financial services is
limited. The sector is highly concentrated,
with close to 80 percent of bank assets
being held by the three largest banks, and—
according to the 2008 FSAP—10 percent of
­individual borrowers receiving approximately
80 per­cent of total loans. Roughly 40 percent
of total credit is extended to commerce and
services activities, whereas agriculture receives less than 0.2 percent (figure 3.11).
Haiti’s infrastructure also falls short. Island
economies are extremely dependent on the
quality, frequency and cost of the means of
transport that link them to markets which
represent both market outlets for their products and supply sources for the needed imported goods. The efficiency and effectiveness
of transport, whether by road, by sea, or by
air, therefore contribute to the competitiveness of these countries. The quality of transport and logistics services in Haiti is poor,
however, the country ranking 144th out of
160 countries on the World Bank’s logistics
performance index (LPI) in 2013 and trailing behind its competitors (figure 3.12).8
The road network in Haiti is in poor condition and many parts of the territory are not
well connected: 60 percent of people living
in rural areas do not have access to main
roads during the rainy season.9 Haiti is also

less integrated into the global shipping line
network than many developing countries.10
Furthermore, the costs of loading and unloading a standard container at Port-au-Prince
are by far the highest of the Caribbean ports
(figure 3.13).11
In particular, the provision of electricity is
problematic. The electricity current is unstable and there are frequent power cuts and
surges, which can result in serious damage to
industrial equipment. Despite this poor service,
the cost of electricity is among the highest in
the region. In 2011, industry was charged
$0.32/Kwh, compared to $0.18 in Nicaragua,
$0.17 in the Dominican Republic and $0.06 in
Bangladesh IFC (2011). These countries are
Trends and Drivers of Growth

Haiti’s competitors in light manufacturing
and apparel industry. Since reliability is low,
Haitian industries must have backup power
sources, generally diesel generators. Fur­ther­
more, the supply of electricity covers only a
small proportion of the country, with rural
areas being particularly neglected. Per capita
consumption of electricity in Haiti is substantially lower than in other Caribbean countries,
for example, it is only two percent of the level
in the Dominican Republic (figure 3.14).
Access to clean water and improved sanitation in Haiti also remains limited. Access to
quality water is a significant challenge in
rural areas and small towns of Haiti (table 2.1).
Rural areas are generally served through water

points equipped with hand pumps, while small
towns are served with gravity-fed piped systems from which water is delivered through
stand posts, kiosks and household connections. A substantial portion of the system is
not operational, however, for lack of sufficient funds for operation and maintenance,
and less than ten percent are equipped with
chlorination devices.12 Sani­tation is equally a
challenge with only 16 per­cent of households
having access to improved sanitation in rural
areas. Both urban and rural populations
mostly rely on individual on-site sanitation
solutions, as sustainable collection and treatment of sewage are practically non-​­existent.
Due to low access to improved sanitation facilities, open defecation is frequent. In this
fragile environment, facilitated by flooding
and heavy rain, cholera broke out and rapidly
spread through Haiti in 2010.
Surveys also point to the lack of qualified labor ILO (2010). One major constraint faced by enterprises in Haiti is the
difficulty to find technicians that are well
qualified, particularly in new technologies.
This forces the country to position itself as a
low cost producer for goods and services
requiring little skills. An opaque labor
market may be at fault, with no institutional
mechanism to enable the ex­change of information between labor demand and supply. More generally, the level of education
among the adult population remains low:
45.7 percent of the adult population (60.5
percent of households’ heads) have never
attended school or have not completed
primary education. Not mastering basic
skills such as literacy and numeracy when
starting work represents a major impediment for their insertion in the labor market and, more importantly, for their ability
to absorb post-school training either on or
Trends and Drivers of Growth

off the job, and to adapt to changing job
requirements.
Against this backdrop, light manufacturing is a success story, but with challenges. The
apparel industry has expanded rapidly since
2009 with exports especially to the US market helped by preferential access agreements.
These exports have been growing at 18 percent
per year. The industry is estimated to employ
about 30’000 workers at present and is expected to expand further in the future. It is by
far the largest formal employer. Wages remain,
nevertheless, low, while rapid migration and
informal housing settlements around these
firms can rapidly create developmental challenges due to limited infrastructure and government services to meet workers’ needs.
Nonetheless, apparel wage-earners have a
vested interest in stability, and could be a
source of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. However, as long as port and electricity
costs remain high compared to its com­pe­
titors, Haiti’s comparative advantage rests on
cheap labor, which will force wages to remain low.
Tourism has a long way to go, but could
contribute significantly to growth. Haiti’s s
potential in tourism is rich, not only because
of beautiful nature and beaches, but also because of its world-class cultural and natural
heritage, such as the Citadelle, Palais Sans
Souci, and Ramiers, classified as World
Heritage sites by UNESCO. Demand for
tourism services is growing with close to
one million visitors registered in 2013 according to the World Tour­ism Organization.
Most of these visitors are from the Haitian
diaspora in the US and cruise ship visitors,
with overnight visitors in some of the emerging tourist resorts and high-end hotels representing a much smaller number, thus limiting
the economic impact of tourism so far.

24,000 people arrive by cruise ship every
week, but there are no excursions within Haiti
organized. Haiti’s performance also pales in
comparison to its neighbor, the Dominican
Republic, where 90 percent of its more than
five million visitors annually stayed overnight
and expenditure amounted to about 8 percent
of GDP in 2013. Overall, while the potential
is significant, Haiti’s tourism industry has a
long way to go, including overcoming the
image of a dangerous country, marred by violence and cholera, and, once again, its weak
transport and electricity infrastructure.
Mining holds potential, but comes with
social and environmental challenges. Haiti
shows significant potential in mineral and
metal mining. Based on preliminary exploratory activities, Haiti is expected to have substantial deposits, especially in gold, silver,
copper, and aluminum bauxite. Given the
limited information available, determining the
economic potential of mining in the country
has to be approached with caution. Estimates
suggest a reserve value of about US$5–6
­billion at current market prices. Successful
exploitation of this wealth will, however,
require a much more concerted effort by
the government to put in place the appropriate policy, regulatory and institutional
framework. At present, the framework for
awarding exploration and exploitation licenses suffers from a lack of transparency,
leading some larger mining companies to
halt their exploration work. Most importantly, managing the environmental and
social impact of mining will need to be addressed, including through an open and
transparent community and stakeholder
engagement mechanism to ensure that
local communities affected by these operations can help shape these operations and
benefit from them.

How could the earnings of the underemployed and those employed in the informal sector be improved? The formal
manufacturing and service sectors have the
potential to be an important source of employment, but because they hire such a
small share of the labor force, even with
very high growth rates, they will not be able
to absorb more than a fraction of the new
entrants. Figure 3.15 simulates the share of
the labor force in the informal and agriculture sectors. Even with a ten percent annual
growth rate—in line with the strong job creation observed over the past five years, implying about 30,000 new formal jobs a
year—formal employment would only account for about 20 percent of the labor
force in a decade. Most Haitians are thus
Trends and Drivers of Growth

likely to continue working in low-productivity agriculture and non-agriculture informal
sector activities over the foreseeable future.
The challenge is thus to enhance the productivity—hence the earnings—of those already employed, while at the same time
creating more formal jobs.13
The constraints discussed above seem to
be particularly present in agriculture. Haiti’s
agricultural potential has yet to translate into
commercial agribusiness. Notwithstanding
the fact that 40 percent of jobs in Haiti are in
agriculture, the country is far from developing a commercial agribusiness sector. The ag­
ri­culture sector in Haiti has been declining
for many years, the result of neglected rural
infrastructure, weak research and extension,
poorly defined land tenure, limited access to
credit, and under-investment in human capital. Even in potentially successful niches such
as coffee, cacao or mangoes, the vast majority
of agricultural production continues to be related to low-productivity subsistence farming. There has been a general shift out of long
cycle towards short cycle production (annual
cereal cultures and vegetables). These factors,
along with high population growth, have con­
tri­buted to shrinking parcel sizes; complex,
informal tenure systems that discourage longterm investment; and cultivation of marginal
lands with steep slopes, encroaching on forests, destroying watersheds, and aggravating
the tenuous environmental situation.
Limitations in logistics are particularly
constraining for agriculture supply chains.
Firms in the agriculture sector do not get to
choose where to set up shop and need to
transport their products to the markets.
Supply chains analyses carried out on six
products showed that transport-associated
losses could be extremely high.14 For informal products, loss levels could be in the
Trends and Drivers of Growth

range of 40 percent. Transport services are
often unavailable, and Haiti’s two rainy seasons often make roads impassable. When
factoring in mangoes that spoil in the field
before they can be transported, one exporter estimated that losses could reach up
to 50 percent. In production zones with poor
accessibility, producers and traders are forced
to transport goods on horse­back or by foot.
The first segment of transport, from the farm
to the first point of collection, is the most
costly in terms of actual and implicit transport costs and losses. Lastly, poor storage
conditions reduce the shelf-life of pro­duce,
making producers anxious to sell at any
price and cutting the season down to its
min­imum time range.
Regarding the informal sector, improvements in skills and access to inputs could enhance income prospects. Most of the nonfarm
enterprises in Haiti operate on a small scale
and are in the informal sector. Nonfarm businesses are micro in nature and have an average
of 1.5 workers, including the owner. An analysis of correlates of successful self-employed
performance was carried out, using three measures: revenues per worker (in log), revenues
per worker in the top 30 of the distribution,
profits per worker in the top 30 of the distribution (results are presented in appendix B).
With the caveat that this exercise indicates a
conditional correlation rather than a causal
relation, the analysis helps nevertheless identify the characteristics and inputs that could
be significantly more relevant to improve
­understanding of what will it take to elevate
productivity and generate jobs in the self-­
employed and small business sector. The results suggest that human capital (experience,
skills), and access to physical capital such as
electricity and water, are associated with
higher returns.

1. There are reasons to believe that investment
figures in Haiti are over estimated. Both treasury financed and donor’s financed projects
have a significant share of current expenditures recorded as investment.
2. A simple regression would suggest that natural
disasters and Cabinet changes could account
for 60 percent of the variance in TFP.

Singh, and Konstantin M. Wacker.
4. UNODC Homicide data.
5. The main state penitentiary collapsed following the earthquake, allowing most of the criminals to escape. Combined with a still weak
law enforcement and justice system, this event
enabled criminal gangs to grow, as well as political assassinations, carjackings, and kidnappings to continue.
6. The Inter-American Development Bank
(2009) mentions for instance that in 1984 the
vast majority of U.S. baseballs were assembled
in Haiti. The same seems to have been true for
the Rubik’s Cube. 125,000 workers were employed in the sector at the time and the embargo brought this number close to zero ten
years later.
7. Customs provides about 30 percent of budget resources. In addition to fraud prevention, the customs department also has the
responsibility of stopping unfair competition
and unwarranted earnings, while at the same
time facilitating fluid and transparent trade
transactions. The main entry point for individuals and merchandise is Port-au-Prince.
The customs services situated at the port and
the airport of Port au Prince cover respectively more than 90 percent of imports and
70 exports of the country. They also generate
84 percent of customs receipts. In addition,
eight customs posts are situated around the
perimeter of the country and there are also
mobile brigades.
8. The LPI is based on six core dimensions of
trade-related services, including customs,

infrastructure, international shipments, logistics competence, tracking and tracing, and
timeliness.
9. The sharp deterioration of Haiti’s road network, the inadequate packaging of fruit
and vegetables and the use of vehicles unsuited to the transport of agricultural goods
are responsible for considerable commercial losses. In the North West, for instance,
transport costs for a stem of bananas from
the farm to the primary market are estimated to represent 25 percent of the sale
price or 45 percent of the profit margin
(World Bank 2013).
10. According to UNCTAD’s liner shipping
­connectivity index (LSCI), Haiti ranks lower
than the main players in the Caribbean:
Haiti’s score of 5 is much lower than scores
by Jamaica (21) and the Bahamas (27), and
the Dominican Republic (23) that host
transshipments ports. The liner shipping
­
­connectivity index (LSCI) is made up of five
components: 1) the number of companies that
provide services from/to a country’s ports; 2)
the size of the largest ship providing services
from/to a country’s port (measured in Twenty
foot Equivalent Units–TEU); 3) the number
of services that connect the country’s port(s)
to other countries’ ports; 4) the total number
of ships operating from/to the country’s port;
and 5) the total container carrying capacity of
those ships.
11. According to a 2009 study mandated by the
Haitian Chamber of Commerce, costs in
Port-au-Prince are five times higher than
in the ports of the Dominican Republic
(World Bank 2013).
12. DINEPA’s performance monitoring system,
which monitors roughly half of the water supply systems, estimates that 41 percent of the
stand posts and 45 percent of the kiosks do not
deliver water.
13. For an early discussion of these themes,
see for instance Delatour and Dnggleby
(1993).

Trends and Drivers of Growth

14. Supply chain analysis shows how the effects of
constraints (costs, times and losses) are distributed throughout the logistics chain. In case of
Haiti, surveys and semi-structured interviews
have been conducted with government officials, shipping companies, exporters for three
formal supply chains: mangoes (Artibonite,

Gros-Morne), rice (Estère, Pont Sondé,
Desdunes, Verrettes, Artibonite) and vetiver
(Les Cayes, Sud). In addition, three informal
supply chains have been examined: mangoes
(Carice and Capotille, Nord-Est), and coffee and
avocadoes (Central Plateau Region—Savanette,
Baptiste—Centre).

4. Sustainability
Environment
Urbanization is increasing Haiti’s vulnerability to natural disasters. As a safety
valve, migration probably contains poverty
and provides relief to many families through
private transfers. However, moving to urban
areas is putting pressure on the environment,
and leading to the settlement of large populations in vulnerable places (figures 4.1 and
4.2). Their settlement in urban areas takes
place usually in the cheapest, less accessible,
and least serviced land, more often than not,
in disaster-prone areas. Floods, hurricanes
and earthquakes have considerable intensity in urban areas that make the precarious
and informal urban dwellers particularly
vulnerable. In terms of the number of communes, urban areas are the most prone to
suffer floods. Twenty-seven communes lay
within the highest risk of flood-prone area.
The severity of hurricanes seems also to be
more acute in urban areas. Two-thirds of
urban communes and over 70 percent of
urban population are affected by hurricanes
with medium to high impact.
This unplanned urban growth has created
vulnerabilities for both the physical environment and those who live in it. Settlers tend
to occupy areas that are not only prone to
risk from disasters, but are also sometimes
nature’s protection from risk. Coastal cities
are throughout the world seeing an increase
in shoreline retreat, which exposes them to
a greater risk of flooding partly due to degraded coastal ecosystems by human activity
(Sanchez-Reaza and Carletto 2013). This slow
degradation of the environment in turn

Sustainability

increases the country’s vulnerability as a
whole to natural disasters. The metropolitan
area of Port-au-Prince, for instance, is a
coastal plain surrounded by the mountain
chain Morne l’Hôpital, which severely limits
the availability of land for growth. However,
the urban area has experienced an explosive
expansion in the past two decades with a
near total absence of urban planning and
growth regulation, much of it on precarious
terrain. The trees and other vegetation that
used to cover the Morne have now almost
completely disappeared, giving way to a
spontaneous and anarchic urbanization occurring on both state-owned and private
land.
Furthermore, natural disasters imply significant fiscal costs. Work was carried out
jointly with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) to develop several hypotheses regarding contingent liabilities for the
government in the event of disasters. The
results suggest that the annual average fiscal
cost for the government can be estimated at
around one percent of GDP. This estimated
cost was based on modeling used by the
CCRIF, and is linked to damages caused by
tropical hurricanes (0.8 percent of GDP) and
by earth­quakes (0.2 percent of GDP). In the
absence of a financial strategy to manage
this risk and provide appropriate fiscal buffers, natural disasters will require reallocating public funds and involve high
opportunity costs.
Less frequent, higher-impact events can
pose a real threat to the sustainability of public
finances. While frequent, low-impact events

constrain fiscal space, less frequent, high­erimpact events can imply significant fiscal
shocks and pose a real threat to the sustainability of public finances. Although with large
opportunity costs as discussed above, the government can mobilize a portion of its financing with respect to low-impact events through
budget reallocations or the use of its deposits.
However, these funds will not be sufficient to
address major events that give rise to costs
that far exceed the government’s financing capacity. The fiscal shock associated with a hurricane that occurs once every 50 years, for
instance, is estimated at about 10 percent of
GDP, representing a much greater risk for fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability.

Rapid migration to urban neighborhoods,
associated with poverty, unemployment, political and social marginalization, limited
­access to services, and weak governance,
could fuel the formation of gangs that engage at-risk youth and draw them in. These
grievances have also contributed to intergenerational conflict, undermining social
cohesion and hindering the capacity of many
communities for productive collective action
Marc et al. (2012).
Violence in Haiti tends to be predominantly an urban phenomenon. Looking at
the number of politically violent events
across arrondissements between 2000 and
2010, one observes that urban centers are
by far the arrondissements with the largest
number of conflict events per capita (map 4.1,
figure 4.3). This observation is confirmed
using the MINUSTAH data for the most
­recent period covering criminal events
(map 4.1, figure 4.4). Even when controlling
for relevant variables, our empirical work
suggests that the share of urban population

Social Tensions
Rapid urbanization could also be
feeding greater violence. Youth violence
is often expressed as a reaction to perceived
social and economic exclusion—grievances that
can easily be mobilized by political interests.1

in the arrondissement is positively and significantly correlated with conflict intensity
(box 4.1).
Migration is associated with greater violence, as social ties erode. The share of immigrants in the arrondissement’s population
is also positively correlated with conflict intensity. New migrants are likely to have less
access to local social networks which provide economic and social support in case of
negative shocks. Such buffer mechanisms
are an effective way to reduce tensions in
Haiti. Controlling for the presence of extended families confirms this interpretation.
Given the dearth of data at the arrondissement level on such measures, we resort to
the 2001 household survey which enables us
to construct department-wise share of ‘extended families’ and ‘extended kinship’
combined. The former is a household composed of more nuclear fam­i­lies and the latter
is a network of more families not necessarily
linked by blood re­lations. Adding this
variable to the regression explains the migration variable away: a denser social network can help prevent or resolve disputes
through non-violent means.

Macroeconomy

64

Macroeconomic stability has been
maintained. Haiti’s macroeconomic environment has significantly improved over the
past decade, as was noted in the most recent
IMF ex post assessment (IMF 2014c).
Inflation was brought back to single digits
and has remained contained at these levels
since 2009, reaching 4.5 percent at end-FY14
(figure 4.5). International reserves have been
built up and maintained at an adequate level,
covering about 5 months of imports.
Domestic revenue mobilization has also improved, although it is still low by regional
standards (13 percent of GDP in 2012).
Between 2009 and 2011, Haiti’s stock of
­external debt drastically shrank following
debt relief. In addition to benefiting from the
HIPC and the MDRI, Haiti received additional debt cancellation in the aftermath of
the 2010 earthquake. As a result, total external debt fell from 29.4 percent of GDP to
8.9 percent of GDP in 2011.
The IMF in its most recent assessment estimated that the exchange rate remains
broadly in line with its medium-term

Drivers of Conflict in Haiti—An Empirical Analysisa

In order to understand better the role of various socio-economic factors in explaining the ebbs and
flows of conflict across Haiti in the 2000s, a cross-sectional analysis across the 42 Haitian arrondissements was run. This strategy has the advantage of allowing us to control for national level factors that may not be properly observable in cross-country analyses and may be endogenous to
conflict. In addition the within-country analysis relies on a more homogenous definition of conflict events than a cross-country analysis, although coming at a cost of not allowing for the investigation of the role of factors that do not vary across spatial units or over the period of analysis, such
as the political regime and the oligopolistic nature of the economy.
We used data on conflict events from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project,
which collects and codes media reports on civil and communal conflicts, militia interactions, violence against civilians, rioting, and protests across various countries since 1997. In the case of Haiti
the data is available between 1997 and July 2010. We aggregated the individual conflict events at the
department and sub-department (“Arrondissement”) level to construct time varying conflict intensity measures at our unit of analysis.
We complement these data with data on crimes collected by MINUSTAH mainly on the basis of
Haiti National Police (HNP) reports. These data are more recent, covering the period 2010 to
September 2014, although not strictly comparable with the conflict events data as they include a
broad variety of criminal activities, such as robberies, thefts, homicides, rapes, illegal possession of
firearms. Most of these events are not related to political violence or political actions as it is the case
for the events recorded by ACLED. Nevertheless, they provide a useful additional dimension and
allow us to gauge the latest developments in violence in Haiti.
The results of our analysis suggest that violence in Haiti in the last decade tends to be predominantly an urban phenomenon. Both political violence and criminal activities are concentrated in
urban centers. A higher share of immigrants from other areas of the country is also associated with
higher conflict intensity. This result is mainly driven by the fact that a higher migrants’ share is associated with a lower presence of social networks (measured as extended families and kinship),
which reduce conflict. The analysis would also indicate that past conflict and land ownership are all
important correlates of violence.
In addition, the results suggest that economic shocks matter a great deal in explaining the pattern
of conflict in Haiti. In particular, increases in remittances are associated with a reduction in conflict
intensity, consistent with the idea that by raising incomes they raise the opportunity cost of participating into violent activities. Finally, the evidence suggests that election periods amplify the effect
of economic shocks on conflict.

Since 2010, a moderate depreciation of the
nominal effective exchange rate coupled with
inflation above that of key trade partners has
led to a gradual real appreciation of the

Haitian currency. Enhancing competitiveness in Haiti is predicated on structural
­reforms to boost productivity through improving infrastructure and the business environment, as discussed later on.2
Sustainability

Haiti’s twin fiscal and current account
deficits have, nevertheless, widened. The
fiscal deficit averaged 2.2 percent of GDP
during 2006–09, but widened to 7.1 per­
cent and 6.3 percent of GDP in 2013 and
2014, respectively (figures 4.7 and 4.8).
This widening fiscal deficit mainly reflected
transfers to the public electricity company
(EDH), which amounted to about 1.5 per­
cent of GDP in 2013, and the fuel retail
price freeze that had a fiscal cost of almost
2 percent point of GDP (box 4.2). The coun­
terpart of the rising fiscal deficit was a rising external current account deficit. Both
deficits are largely financed by concessional
external borrowing. Despite this steady
accumulation of debt, the latest joint

Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis
concluded that Haiti’s debt profile faced
only a moderate risk of debt distress
(IMF 2015).

Electricité d’Haïti (EDH)

Due to poor management, the performance of the national, vertically integrated electricity utility
Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) has deteriorated over time. Worsening commercial performance has led
to a lack of infrastructure maintenance and has rapidly deteriorated the quality of electricity service, including frequent service interruptions and large voltage fluctuations. The sector’s institutional framework is obsolete (e.g., not allowing EDH to tap into important renewable energy
potential), sector policies are out of date, planning and monitoring of sector activities is inadequate, and vested interests have hampered reform efforts. The effect of the earthquake on power
generation, transmission, and distribution further aggravated EDH’s weak performance by delaying key modernization activities (e.g., new billing system and the rehabilitation of the Peligre hydropower plant). In 2015, EDH’s losses stood at 57 percent of the electricity generated (of which
commercial losses represented nearly 35 percent).
EDH’s weak grid infrastructure, poor commercial performance, and inadequate controls over subcontracted electricity generation by independent power producers (IPPs) have led to a financial
drain on government resources. Due to its inability to meet electricity demand and in an attempt
to expand electricity availability, EDH has subcontracted part of the production of electricity to
IPPs.a Unable to cover its operating expenses, including fuel costs and power purchases in part because of low bill collection rates, EDH has relied on fiscal transfers from the Treasury averaging
US$200 million annually in recent years (equivalent to 10 percent of the national budget and 1–2
percent of GDP).b
Past governance reforms to preserve the integrity of public resource management in the electricity sector have produced modest results. Achievements to-date include: (a) EDH Commercial
Recovery action plans (2012–2013; 2013–2014; and 2014–2015); (b) a National Directions Paper
(endorsed by Cabinet on September 15, 2013); and (c) a government Energy White Paper (in
draft). Since 2014, an active dialogue on the management and reform of the energy sector has
been initiated within the government’s Energy Commission and with the strategic partners in the
sector.

government deposits needed to be drawn
down (figure 4.10). Wider fiscal and current
account deficits are also raising concerns
about a crowding out of private sector credit
with a monetary stance becoming tighter to
contain the mounting pressures on Haiti’s
currency.
The recent decline in international oil
prices is further tightening fiscal resources.
According to the Petrocaribe agreement,
68

lower international oil prices imply a higher
payment rate and less concessional financing. With lower international oil prices, Haiti
has experienced a substantial decline in the
availability of concessional financing.
International oil prices are expected to remain low in the near future, making it even
more challenging for the country to balance
the need to ensure macroeconomic stability
while protecting the social and investment

Against this backdrop, poverty could rise
again. As mentioned in Chapter 2, increases
in non-agriculture income linked to sectors
related to aid or reconstruction have driven
part of the poverty reduction observed in
Haiti. In 2012, more than 80 per­cent of the
population lived with less than four dollars a
day (PPP) and only two percent lived with
ten dollars or more. These numbers indicate

that most households have a consumption budget close to the poverty line (figure
4.13). In this context, a decline in activities
related to aid and reconstruction could adversely affect the living standards of many
vulnerable households, potentially reversing
part of the recent gains in poverty reduction.
Some progress in service delivery could also
be jeopardized, such as in health where almost 80 percent of spending in 2012 was
donor-financed.

5. Priorities
Prioritization Process
The systematic country diagnostic
(SCD) seeks to identify the most important
constraints to and opportunities for inclusive
and sustainable growth in Haiti. The previous
chapters on Haiti’s growth performance and
lack of inclusiveness, as well as the diagnostic
of poverty and growth, are the first steps in
identifying priority areas and opportunities to
increase growth and welfare. The report now
attempts to provide a sense of prioritization
and identify the most binding constraints to
faster economic growth and greater shared
prosperity, both quantitatively and through a
series of consultations with stakeholders and
the Country Team (figure 5.1).

Quantitative Assessment
While overall income growth is a neces­
sary condition for reducing extreme poverty, it
is not sufficient. The obstacles to faster eco­
nomic growth and greater poverty reduction
have been described above, but faster economic
growth alone will not be enough to bring sig­
nificant improvements in the living standards
of most Haitians. Simulations show that if
growth in Haiti up to 2030 were to follow its
historical performance, poverty would hardly
decline. Under the more sustained perfor­
mance of one percent real per capita growth
rate observed in Haiti over the 2005–09, pov­
erty reduction would still fall significantly
short of reaching the goal of extreme poverty
of 3 percent or less by 2030 (figure 5.2). Re­
ducing extreme poverty by almost half in 15
years, to about 14 percent, would require an
overall GDP growth of 3.3 percent per year,
Priorities

the average growth registered in post-earth­
quake/reconstruction years (2011–14). As­
suming unchanged income distribution, per
capita GDP would need to grow by about 7
percent per year for extreme poverty to fall
to 3 percent by 2030. This would require a
two- to three-fold acceleration in Haiti’s growth
rate with respect to its best performing years:
a very ambitious outcome.
Policies to ensure more inclusiveness are
needed. Increasing growth of the bottom 40
percent by around one percentage point more
than the best observed average growth rate
(2005–09) would add considerable impetus
to poverty reduction. In this scenario, per
­capita real GDP of the bottom 40 percent
would grow twice as fast as the mean. Such a
performance would cause poverty to d
­ ecrease
by 5 percentage points more than in the dis­
tribution neutral growth scenario, coming
closer but still falling short from reaching the 3
percent target for extreme poverty by 2030. To
achieve the 3 percent target, a combination of
faster and more inclusive growth would be
needed: a growth of about 4 percent per year
with the income of the bottom 40 growing at
twice that speed. But what would be the mea­
sures needed to deliver this faster growth in
lower income groups? Once identified, could
they be ranked to assist the setting of priorities?
Human capital and political stability mat­
ter more for lower income groups. First, the
correlation between potential drivers of income
and the income growth of the poorest 20 and
poorest 40 percent of households were esti­
mated, using household data for a sample of
100 countries (box 5.1). This measure gives us
the expected impact of changing one of these

drivers on the income growth of the poorest.
Second, following Araujo et al. (2014), the stan­
dard deviation of each variable is taken to il­
lustrate the magnitude of possible or realistic
change one could expect in this variable. A vari­
able with a higher standard deviation would
be expected to be “easy to change.” Multiplying
the two gives a rough estimate of the expected
effect of a regular change in a variable for in­
come developments. The analysis finds that
health (proxied by life expectancy), as well as
education (measured by school enrollment)
are important for increasing income genera­
tion at the bottom of the income distribution
(figure 5.3). Reasonable changes in political
stability (measured by the number of cabinet
changes and within-regime instability)
72

matter slightly more to the lower income
groups. Infrastructure (measured by mobile
phone usage, a common measure in the lit­
erature) and transparency, although not dis­
proportionally favoring the lowest income
group, are nevertheless ­important for overall
income growth.
As an alternative, Haiti’s performance in key
variables was benchmarked to a reference group.
As a reference group, the average of an aspi­
rational group of countries was taken (Belize,
the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Jamaica, Paraguay, and Peru). In terms of in­
come levels, these LAC countries broadly
stand today where Haiti aspires to be after
2030, i.e., beyond a threshold of US$2,310,
taken to illustrate economic emergence.

BOX 5.1 Benchmarking the Drivers of Shared Prosperity: An Application
to Haitia
We estimate economic magnitudes for key correlates of income growth at the mean, the bottom 40
and 20 percent of the income distribution across a set of about 100 countries. While econometric
exercises investigating determinants of GDP growth have been numerous, less is known about fac­
tors influencing household incomes at different segments of the income distribution. Empirical
work by Dollar and Kraay (2002) and Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013) broadly rejects the
idea that other factors than mean income growth would influence incomes of the poor, thus sug­
gesting that growth would be mostly distribution neutral, whereas other studies have attempted to
outline key drivers of pro-poor growth (e.g., Bourguignon 2003; Ravallion and Chen 2007;
Christiaensen, Punam, and Sanoh 2013). Our results add to this discussion and suggest that some
factors indeed allow growth to be more beneficial for the bottom 40 or 20 percent of the income
distribution.
Our data set is mainly based on Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). The data covers household data
from the World Bank’s POVCALNET and the Luxembourg Income Study databases. Household
income data is organized in “spells,” i.e., income changes between two survey years, calculated as
average annual log differences.b These are calculated for average income, income at the bottom 20
percent or the bottom 40 percent. We focus on those non-overlapping spells that are at least five
years long, providing 299 spells for 117 countries with a median spell length of 6 years, which is
also the preferred sample of Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay (2013). To this data, we add macroeco­
nomic variables, especially measures of political stability or institutions that are of particular inter­
est for Haiti.
Based on a fixed effect estimation, the results confirm that the income at the bottom 20 and 40
percent grow with mean income. The estimated effect is a little smaller than previously thought, al­
though the estimated elasticity around 0.85 is statistically not significantly different from one. We
also find that better health and education outcomes, as well as lower political instability, have an
economically relevant effect for income growth that goes beyond the effect via mean income (i.e., it
is stronger at the bottom of the distribution).

Figure 5.4 illustrates Haiti’s position relative to
its aspirational peers with respect to life ex­
pectancy. It shows that the country is in the
lowest third percentile of the health distribu­
tion and lags behind the group average by
approximately ten years. Figure 5.5 does the
same for cabinet changes, highlighting that
other peers suffered from comparable political
instability (especially Peru, Ecuador, and
Paraguay).
Priorities

Again, closing the gaps in human capital
and achieving greater political stability seem
to have the highest potential for lower income
groups. Multiplying the gap in the indicators
between Haiti and the reference aspirational
group by the unconditional effects estimated
above captures the potential income gains Haiti
may experience from closing the gap in these
key variables. This idea, based on Araujo et al.
(2014), not only highlights the areas where the

this gap by the economic relevance of closing
it.1 Figure 5.6 shows the income effect from
closing the gap relative to the reference aspi­
rational group for different parts of the income
distribution. Variables relating to health, edu­
cation, political stability clearly stand out. Again,
closing Haiti’s gap in infrastructure, although
not disproportionally favoring the lowest in­
come groups, is important for overall growth.
In turn, political instability—and conflict
risk more generally—could be reduced through
higher spending on social services and social
protection. Security and political instability
seems to be taken very often as exogenous fac­
tors, but recent international evidence suggests
that these factors may at least partly be under
the control of policy makers. Common sources

evidence that spending on education or health,
for instance, could contribute reducing these

Higashijima (2014). Based on an empirical
analysis that covers 148 countries from 1960

cial protection) is associated with lower risk
of small-scale conflict onset (box 5.2).
Lack of economic opportunities seems to
be driving violence and instability within Haiti.
Building on the work presented in box 4.1, the
spatial differences in conflict intensity across
Haiti’s territory were examined to shed empir­
ical light on drivers of conflict. The results sug­
gest that economic shocks matter a great deal
in explaining the pattern of conflict in Haiti.
In particular, increases in remittances appear
to reduce conflict intensity, consistent with the
idea that by raising incomes they raise the op­
portunity cost of participating into violent ac­
tivities. Similarly, the study finds that an increase

The next step in the prioritization pro­
cess was a series of consultations with stake­
holders and the Country Team. Recognizing
the data limitations and the difficulty to un­
tangle association and causality, any quanti­
tative assessment needed to be validated and
comple­mented by a qualitative assessment. The
results of cross-country regressions are not to be
interpreted mechanically, but serve as a starting
point for a discussion about policy priorities. For
this purpose, a two-day Country Team retreat
was set up. In addition, continued consulta­
tions with the authorities and other stakeholders
(including representatives of the established
private sector and civil society) were carried out.2
The Team also reached out to the Haitian dias­
pora and to beneficiaries of the Kore Fanmi
program.3 Furthermore, a Bank-sponsored
competition of academic papers was launched
(“The Twin Goals Awards”) to foster research
and debate, as well as identify any issue that
may have been over-looked (box 5.3). These
discussions led to the identification of broad
themes or opportunities going forward.
Consultations validated the overall story
line. Discussions confirmed that institutions,
human capital, and infrastructure all mat­
tered for Haiti’s economic growth and shared
prosperity. It was pointed out that economic
and sector work on Haiti produced in 1980s
and the early 1990s had already identified
most of the challenges presented in the

BOX 5.2 Conflict and Welfare Spending in Haiti: What Could We Learn
from Cross-Country Evidence?a
Azam (2001) observed that “the occurrence of civil conflict is intimately related to the failure of gov­
ernment to deliver the type of public expenditure that people want; i.e., with a strong redistributive
component such as health and education.” Governments could thus foster their legitimacy, and thereby
reduce the risk of conflict, by signaling that they care about their population. This could be done in a
variety of ways, such as increased spending for water sanitation, securing basic health needs, or provid­
ing a strong system of education (Stasavage 2005).
Probability of small conflict

(2006) suggests that education promotes social cohesion by encouraging students to cultivate interper­
sonal skills and thus learn how to resolve disputes peacefully.
Our empirical analysis covers 148 countries over 1960–2009 and uses a random effects logit model
with regional dummies and a set of standard control variables to predict the probability of conflict.
To measure the onset of violent conflict, we used the Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) from the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program PRIO for years 1960–2009 (Gleditsch et al. 2002, Version 4.1.) to
generate a dichotomous variable that takes the value of one in years with a new conflict onset and
zero otherwise. This dataset has become the standard reference for cross-country analyses of con­
flict determinants. The onset of conflict was defined with those above a threshold of 25 battle
deaths per year.
The results suggest that higher welfare expenditure (education, health and social) is associated with
lower risk of conflict. In order to simulate the effects for Haiti, the coefficients of the cross-country
regression were taken and all variables in the model set at their average for Haiti with the exception
for welfare spending that we let vary. The Figure above illustrates the reduction in the risk on con­
flict onset associated with higher welfare spending.

Priorities

previous sections. It was thought already at the
time unlikely that much economic progress
could be achieved without an improvement in
educational quality and access. Infrastructure
had deteriorated badly. Migration to urban
areas had strained water and sanitation facil­
ities, and increased urban vulnerabilities and
people exposures. It was argued that it would
be difficult to tackle these problems effectively
without first addressing the issue of gover­
nance. In addition, the consultations high­
lighted a number of other dimensions.
Maintaining the stability of the macroeco­
nomic environment called for immediate at­
tention. There was a broad recognition that
progress had been made in restoring macro­
economic stability and this did not seem to be
at the moment a constraint to faster growth or
greater shared prosperity. This assessment was,
however, backward looking and concerns were
expressed going forward. The decline in donor
assistance and lower availability of concessional
financing following the drop in international
oil prices raised questions about the sustain­
ability of many social programs and of the re­
cent progress in improving access to many basic
services. Even the established private sector
expressed concern about the tighter mone­
tary stance being followed.
Turning to more medium-term challenges,
it was stressed that progress needed to be made
simultaneously on several fronts. For Haiti to
break from its past and achieve meaningful
progress towards poverty reduction, a piece­
meal approach to reform focusing on a spe­
cific sector would not work. Actions or reforms
should not be seen as independent from each
other, but needed to fit within a package. Vio­
lence and political instability, for instance, are
seen as a binding constraint to faster growth
and greater economic opportunities. However,
both the UN forces and NGOs dealing with
Priorities

gangs recognized that greater economic op­
portunities were in turn needed to reduce vi­
olence. Improving education without better
economic opportunities fed greater emigra­
tion. Discussions in villages highlighted that
improving seeds or production techniques
without better transport or access to markets
just depressed prices and could make farmers
worse off.
Controlling cholera illustrates the need for
a multi-sectoral approach. Cholera control will
contribute to improving the health of Haitians,
particularly of the poor, and fostering the longterm development of the country. The most
effective way to achieve this involves multi-sec­
toral interventions aimed at improving health
care, hygiene, an access to clean water and im­
proved sanitation. Cholera cannot be con­
trolled without addressing primary vectors of
transmission of the disease such as the lack of
safe water supply, inappropriate excreta man­
agement and the absence of sanitation. Health
interventions are critical to eliminate deaths
from cholera, but to sustainably prevent new
cases of cholera from emerging, these alone
will not be enough. Concurrent and substan­
tial improvements in water supply and sani­
tation coverage, including medium-term
invest­ments in this sector targeted at high
incidence and high risk zones are essential.
Building the social contract was flagged as
particularly important. Most modern democ­
racies use fiscal measures to finance the State
and redistribute wealth. In return, the State is
expected to provide key services. In Haiti, both
sides of this contract are very weak—few peo­
ple or businesses pay taxes and the State
struggles to provide services. State institutions
are needed to provide security and public ser­
vices, and to write the regulations that will allow
a market economy to operate. The established
private sector complained about the power

BOX 5.3

Bank-Sponsored Competition of Academic Papers

In order to foster research and debate, a call was issued for research papers identifying the most
critical constraints and opportunities facing Haiti in accelerating progress toward the goals of end­
ing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The competition was
open to all Haitian scholars and was intended to provide a Haitian perspective to the debate, as well
as identify any issue that the existing literature may have over-looked.
This proposal and the rules were prepared with the Deans of the universities present in Port-auPrince. The competition was widely advertised in academic circles and in regular newspapers, and
submissions were received from Haiti (Port-au-Prince and Cap Haïtien), Canada and the United
States. The papers were reviewed by a panel of World Bank researchers and leading Haitian figures,
including the Presidents of the Association of Haitian Economists, the Haitian Arbitration and
Mediation Division, and the North-East Chamber of Commerce, as well as professors from the
American University and the Autonomous University of Mexico.
The three winners were awarded cash prizes for their contributions and presented their work at a
conference at the State University of Haiti in November, 2014. The event was attended by represen­
tatives from academia, civil society, government, and the international community. This was an
opportunity to discuss issues related to inequality, inadequate competition and economic opportu­
nities, and the absence of a social contract between the State and its citizens which, among other is­
sues, were identified by the participants as impediments to growth.
More particularly, while the papers submitted varied in approaches and emphases, they converged
on a common set of themes underscoring Haiti’s scarcity of human and institutional capital. Most
authors agreed that Haiti’s history of violence, exclusion, and foreign interference explained the
country’s difficulty in developing a shared national vision for its future, as well as the needed insti­
tutions and social capital to implement it. All papers argued that aid dependence and the interfer­
ence of external governmental and non-governmental actors continued to prevent Haiti from
developing home-grown solutions and institutional capacity. In this regard, authors stressed the
State’s ineffectiveness in fulfilling basic functions, such as enforcing the rule of law, collecting taxes,
and delivering services. Poor outcomes in education were seen by most as a principal cause of
Haiti’s poor governance, lack of competitiveness, low productivity, and high unemployment.
Urbanization and population growth were identified as major contributors to vulnerability, and the
need for a more balanced spatial organization of the country was underscored.

surges and outage, the poor road infrastruc­
ture, or health conditions that forced it to pro­
vide the missing services that it would expect
from the State. In line with the results of the
2010 report entitled “Voice of the Voice­less,” there
was a feeling that there was a need to foster a
greater sense of civic responsibility, overcome
social divisions, and establish a more
78

accountable State. There was a very strong
social demand for a balanced and coherent de­
velopment of the country, easier access to
public services as well as more job and edu­
cational opportunities outside what is often
referred to as the “republic of Port-auPrince.” A very large majority wanted to be
able to live near places of origin without
Priorities

having to relocate to the capital to study,
make a living or access public services. For
this to happen, civil society and representa­
tives of the private sector stressed the need to
hold regular elections. There also needs to be
more productive citizen engagement, includ­
ing mechanisms that effectively channel citi­
zens’ voice and demands to the State so that
their concerns can be addressed.
State capacity needs to be strengthened. The
most binding constraints are probably also
those that would take most time to fix. Poor
governance and the need to strengthen the state
were generally viewed as the most important
constraints. Without improvements in these
areas, it was thought that little else could be
achieved. Even for the fastest transforming
countries, improving institutional quality from
the level of a country like Haiti to that of Ghana
takes in the range of 15–30 years (World Bank
2011). Relatedly, Pritchett, Woolcock, and
Andrews (2013) find that rates of improvement
in measures such as quality of bureaucracy
and administrative capacity are typically very
low in developing countries, even with sub­
stantial donor effort. They conclude that “coun­
tries like Haiti or Liberia will take many decades
to reach even a moderate capability country
like India.” The lengthiness of the process
should, however, not deter immediate action,
but only call for more realistic expectations.
In this regard, there was a lot of criticism
about the limited aid effectiveness and ca­
pacity building. The international community
was criticized for not contributing enough to
build the needed capacity. There was a rec­
ognition that in the immediate aftermath of
the earthquake, the Haitian government had
very limited capacity as almost all government
buildings were destroyed and agencies were
operating in a state of emergency. Yet years
later, it was observed that donors continued
Priorities

to be reluctant to fund the government.
Concerns about the lack of capacity within
the Government of Haiti, as well as en­
trenched systems of patronage, corruption,
and inefficiency could be valid. However,
government capacity will never be built or
improved if donors continue to bypass local
institutions in favor of non-State actors. By
circumventing the Haitian government, do­
nors were perceived by many as prolonging
this process and continuing to undermine
the public sector.
To foster greater competition, barriers to
market entry needed to be removed and
small private sector actors supported.
Representatives of the established private
sector recognized the lack of competition ex­
isting in Haiti’s economy, a reflection for
them of the country’s unfavorable business
environment. Without proper contract en­
forcement, business had to be kept between
trusted partners, from credit to the whole lo­
gistics chain. Civil society expressed concern
about the higher prices and the possible lack
of innovation that limited competition im­
plied. Consultations flagged thus the impor­
tance of supporting domestic informal and
smaller private sector actors in strengthening
their capacity to add value to the Haitian
economy. This included facilitating access to
available capital, stronger business manage­
ment capacity, better linkage of producers to
markets and improved infrastructure to sup­
port such links. Direct connections with eco­
nomic partners outside of Haiti were also
suggested as an avenue to explore. The need
for developing such access for agribusiness,
tourism, and manufacturing, among others,
outside of Port-au-Prince was underlined as
particularly important to encourage growth
that would be geographically better balanced
and more pro-poor. Such growth could also
79

contribute to reducing migration to overly
crowded and vulnerable urban environ­
ments, particularly in Port-au-Prince.
Furthermore, there was not only a need
for more jobs, but also for better jobs. There
was a call to recognize where people actually
worked. It was pointed out that the private sec­
tor in Haiti was not only limited to a couple
of large enterprises. Most people in Haiti
were occupied in a less visible private sec­
tor: in the agriculture and informal sectors,
two sectors that had been neglected so far.
The potential contribution of the formal sec­
tor in creating jobs was recognized, but it
was not seen as becoming the main employer
in Haiti any time soon. Incomes generated in
agriculture or in the informal sector are,
however, not sufficient to pull people out of
poverty. The challenge is thus to enhance
the productivity—hence the earnings—of
those already employed in agriculture and
the informal sector, while at the same time
creating more formal jobs. Providing greater
economic opportunities was also flagged as
a critical factor to reduce criminal or political
violence, especially in urban areas, as this
would decrease grievances and frustrations
while increasing the opportunity costs of
joining gangs.
The importance of reducing vulnerabilities
was also stressed. In the face of recurring shocks
and vulnerability, better risk management strat­
egies and targeting in social protection should
be a priority to protect households and indi­
vidual livelihoods. Disaster risks need to be
identified and understood better. Risks need
to be reduced through better awareness when
investing. One million people are vulnerable
to shocks that could push them into poverty.
Despite the significant expansion of social as­
sistance provision within the EDE PÈP frame­
work, the system remains very fragmented and
80

untargeted. Furthermore, it was argued that
it would be important to continue strength­
ening and mainstreaming disaster risk man­
agement activities and make sure disaster risk
management becomes a core component of a
sustainable poverty reduction and economic
growth strategy. Financial protection strate­
gies, particularly if they are designed to meet
the needs of the population in extreme poverty,
can help protect the government and house­
holds from the economic burden of shocks and
disasters.
Finally, the consultations made it clear that
there was limited evidence to inform planning
and targeting of programs and policies. The re­
cently finalized Poverty Assessment conducted
jointly by the Bank and the Haitian authorities,
as well as the ongoing Public Expen­diture
Review, are filling some of the knowledge gaps,
but many more remain, making the conclu­
sions of this SCD tentative. Dis­­cussions with
the Country Team and with stakeholders con­
firmed that it was difficult to carry out effec­
tive development policies without appropriate
statistics or analytics (see appendix C for a
list of gaps). For instance, the knowledge and
monitoring of the actual situation of WSS
services—critical to contain water-borne dis­
eases such as cholera—in Haiti is limited and
fragmented, hampering the efficient prioriti­
zation and programming of investments.
Policy packages—or buckets—rather than
independent activities in sectors were thus rec­
ommended. Consultations identified five broad
themes around which activities needed to be
organized in order to ignite a process whereby
Haiti could set itself on a new development
path: (a) maintaining macroeconomic stabil­
ity, while meeting developmental needs; (b) im­
proving statistics and analytics; (c) creating
greater economic opportunities and better jobs,
including through infrastructure and human
Priorities

capital; (d) (re)building the social contract; and
(e) reducing vulnerabilities and building resil­
ience. Progress on all these themes is needed
simultaneously. In light of the tighter budget
constraints facing the government, maintain­
ing the stability of the macroeconomic envi­
ronment, and improving knowledge and statis­tics
to increase the effectiveness of public policy
(including more transparent fiscal reporting)
call particularly for immediate attention. Further
work will be needed to flesh out in more de­
tail what would need to be included in the pack­
age of reforms and actions to achieve these
objectives, but the possible content of these
buckets are spelled out in a bit more detail in
the next section.

Five Priority Areas for
Policy Action
Short-Term

Maintaining macroeconomic stability,
while meeting develop­ment needs.
Fiscal policy needs to find a balance between
contributing to higher and more inclusive
growth while maintaining sustainability.
Haiti’s dependence on external assistance
at a time of declining aid is a challenge, but
could also be seen as an opportunity for the
country to reduce its reliance on the donor
community. The reduced availability of con­
cessional financing following the decline in
international oil prices has added urgency to
this need. In this regard, achieving a greater
mobilization of own fiscal revenue will be im­
portant as already initiated, as well as identi­
fying options to improve the composition of
public spending (reduce fuel subsidies and
transfers to the state-own electricity company)
as well as its efficiency (especially public
investment).4
Priorities

More particularly, there is an urgent need
to increase tax revenue and to diversify the rev­
enue base away from trade taxes. Despite a rise
in revenue of the past decade, Haiti has one of
the lowest revenue mobilization ratios in the
region. Furthermore, Haiti’s tax system also
tends to be regressive, relying heavily on in­
direct taxes. Corporate and personal income
tax rates are largely comparable to the regional
average. A large share of corporate income
tax revenue is, however, lost because of exemp­
tions. Anecdotal evidence suggests a number
of taxes that generate little revenue but impose
high compliance costs on businesses (“nui­
sance” taxes) and reducing them would be a
better alternative to attract investors. The per­
sonal income tax brackets are also not well
aligned with the country’s socio-economic struc­
ture with top income tax brackets only apply­
ing to a very small share of taxpayers. Ongoing
work to move from the current turn-over tax
to a simple VAT is welcome.
Fuel price subsidies have been eliminated,
but could return. The rise in retail fuel prices
in October 2014, combined with a decline
in international oil prices has allowed the
government to eliminate the fuel price subsi­
dies that were burdening the budget (about
2 percent of GDP in 2013). Such subsidies favor
the rich, more so than subsidies on food, health
or education. International oil prices are, how­
ever, volatile and without the introduction of
an automatic price adjustment mechanism for
petroleum products, fuel price subsidies could
return to haunt the budget, this time under
tighter financing constraints. Fuel price sub­
sidies are, however, only one dimension of
broader development challenges: more gener­
ally, the overall policy framework to develop
urban transport, and promote more sustain­
able and cost effective energy needs to be
strengthened.
81

Despite rising public investment, eco­
nomic growth has not accelerated so far in
Haiti. Haiti still performs poorly for selected
infrastructure indicators, such as access to
electricity, roads or ports. Against this back­
drop, high public investment should have
been expected to contribute to reducing bot­
tlenecks to faster growth. This paradox is,
however, nothing new in Haiti. Several rea­
sons have been put forward, ranging from
deficiencies in the country’s national ac­
counting system to chronic lack of mainte­
nance or simply the unproductive nature of
the investment itself. Poor past donor coor­
dination and the high volatility of external
aid have been argued to have affected the
impact of investments in Haiti. This disap­
pointing outcome stems also in part from
very weak public investment management,
hampering the effectiveness of public
investments.
Improving statistics and analytics.
Statistical and analytical capacities would
need to be strengthened. Access to timely
and consolidated fiscal data would be
­important to monitor appropriately public
spending, especially with tighter budget
­constraints. More regular statistical surveys
on critical sectors for the Haitian economy
will enable better analysis on poverty and
growth, as well as allow the government to
monitor progress and adopt appropriate pol­
icies. In particular, the absence of a recent
census hampers the design and costing of
policies for basic services such as health or
education. Regular monitoring of poverty
and living conditions is a necessary step to
promoting evidence-based and effective pol­
icy making. In this regard, strengthening the
national statistical system through invest­
ments in this sector will be critical.
82

Medium-Term

(Re)building the social contract.
Rebuilding or building the social contract
between Haiti’s state and its citizens will re­
quire greater transparency and accountabil­
ity. More resources and time should be devoted
to build capacity within the Haitian adminis­
tration rather than use non-State actors to de­
liver services. Developing an appropriate fiscal
revenue base will require a renewed climate
of accountability and transparency from both
the government and the private sector. This mu­
tual accountability should be centered around
the private sector’s commitment to full tax com­
pliance, and the government’s commitment to
meeting minimum service levels and manag­
ing budgets, decision-making and funding in
full transparency. More broadly, it will require
a well-functioning civil society and set of in­
stitutions, including regular elections and
greater autonomy at the community level al­
lowing for the emergence of local leadership.
Greater legitimacy will also be needed,
through the provision of basic services across
the country. The provision of services for which
people do care would enhance the legitimacy
of the State and provide more equal economic
opportunities. In particular, the public provi­
sion of services to increase the human capital
accumulation capacity of the poor—such as
health or education—will be essential in break­
ing the vicious circle of intergenerational pov­
erty. Expanding access and the quality of
services, while reducing costs among house­
holds, will be critical to improving health and
education outcomes, particularly among chil­
dren and women. Achieving universal primary
enrollment will also require a short- to medi­
um-term financing plan and an improved co­
ordination with social protection programs.
On the health care front, policies should aim

Priorities

at improving the accountability of service pro­
viders, increasing service utilization and qual­
ity, and expanding preventive health care
services to reduce costs. In both sectors, fur­
thermore, the establishment of an informa­
tion system allowing for better identification
and targeting of vulnerable populations, as well
as for services quality control, will be critical
in optimizing the use of available resources.
Creating greater economic opportuni­
ties and better jobs. Private economic
­activities are the engines for faster and more
inclusive growth. More vibrant private eco­
nomic activities will be critical to create
greater opportunities to escape poverty. In
this regard, macro-economic stability has to
be maintained, as well as vulnerabilities con­
tained and resilience strengthened. More gen­
erally, the business environment should be made
more favorable. All stakeholders, including the
government, the established private sector, and
donors, should agree and adhere to a consis­
tent and comprehensive private sector devel­
opment strategy to maximize the positive role
of the private sector in channeling investment
into viable and productive sectors to create jobs
and generate income.
Foreign direct investment, encouraged by
a more favorable business environment, could
provide new players and enhance competition.
Haiti has had a limited, but broadly positive
experience with FDI, especially in infrastruc­
ture. The entry of Digicel in the telecommu­
nication sector in 2006 has resulted in widening
access to 2.4 million people. The E-Power proj­
ect introduced a lower cost producer while
increasing power generation capacity in Portau-Prince by 35 percent. These successes are
few, unfortunately, hampered by a lack of trans­
parency in existing sectoral policy and regu­
latory environments, and limited institutional
Priorities

capacity in Haiti’s public sector, further com­
pounding the overall difficult business
environment.
Policies to boost households’ income—
wherever they work—are essential to sustain­
ing and accelerating welfare gains. In urban
areas, achieving this objective will have to in­
volve the creation of economic opportuni­
ties and better jobs. A higher level of
education and skills, for example, is cor­
related with higher labor income. In rural
areas, the stagnation of both extreme pov­
erty and income inequality observed be­
tween 2000 and 2012 reflects the increasing
reliance on the low-productivity agricul­
tural sector. Because 80 percent of the ex­
treme poor live in rural areas, it will be
necessary to develop this sector by means of
policies that support income diversification.
Such a diversification could contribute at
spreading risk, strengthening food security,
and preserving biodiversity. Furthermore,
both in urban and rural areas, it is neces­
sary to promote expanded access to inputs
(e.g., seeds, electricity, finance, water) and to
product markets (e.g., transport), as well as
improve the business environment in order
to increase the profitability of employment.
Greater economic opportunities and better
jobs, especially in urban areas, would contrib­
ute in reducing crime and violence, further
improving the business climate.
To reduce poverty and increase productiv­
ity in a more balanced manner across Haiti’s
territory, a multipronged approach is critical.
Opportunities and advantages presented by
various regions outside of the ­capital should
be developed. This approach would aim to
broaden the pool of economic actors and
support their contribution to ­productive ac­
tivities and growth, in an environment en­
compassing most of the poor and the poorest.
83

Multipronged investments in physical and ser­
vice connectivity between rural communities
and producers, and small and regional town
markets and consumers, would add value to
the local economy, help limit post-harvest
production losses, reduce the isolation of local
populations and their disconnection from the
State, and stimulate ­economic activity. If con­
ceived as a set of invest­ments in a given geo­
graphical space, together with the productivity
support discussed above and the expansion of
services discussed below, such an approach
would provide an avenue for accelerating
growth for the bottom 40 percent, for building
greater confidence of the poor in a better fu­
ture, and, in the medium term, possibly pro­
vide alternatives to migration.
Reducing vulnerabilities and building
resilience. Institutional arrangements for
emergency preparedness and disaster preven­
tion and mitigation would need to be strength­
ened. A key initial step toward upgrading the
management of disaster risks involves improv­
ing the identification and understanding of
­disaster risks in Haiti by quantifying and antic­
ipating the potential impacts of natural haz­
ards on Haitian society and the economy. It
would also be important to reduce existing
risks and avoid the creation of new risks by in­
tegrating risk awareness in public policies and
investments. In light of the vulnerability of ag­
riculture and its volatile contribution to eco­
nomic growth, efforts to make production
more resilient to adverse weather conditions
are called for. Given the potential threat natu­
ral hazards pose to the sustainability of public
finances, developing an integrated disaster risk
financing and insurance strategy would also
help ensure greater fiscal capacity in the after­
math of a disaster, while managing the volatil­
ity on fiscal accounts.
84

Progress made thus far in understand­
ing and analyzing urban resiliency needs to
be supported. Following the work on urban
growth and resiliency recently carried out,
more research is needed to document (a)
urban demographic trends, (b) rural to
urban migration trends, (c) urban surface
growth and possible sprawl including land
tenure, (d) the determinants of urbaniza­
tion and the role of secondary cities, (e)
urban-rural linkages and the limitations
imposed on the rural economy by urban
sprawl, (f) investments and public-service
delivery needs for urban areas to address
the double-challenge of poverty and risk, (g)
the role of cities in reducing poverty and
through which channels it is occurring, and
(h) the link between economic and disas­
ter-risk vulnerabilities, i.e., whether the
group of people that just came out of pov­
erty are still vulnerable to poverty reversals
as a result of future disasters.
Social protection would also need to be
less fragmented and better targeted. The
foundational blocks of social protection
should be built, starting with a targeting sys­
tem. Deve­loping a targeting system is an es­
sential step to enhancing human capital
accumulation among the poor and vulnerable
using, among others, a national poverty map
allowing for the identification of pockets of
poverty. This would include moving forward
with the development of a unique registry
of social protection beneficiaries in priority
areas. In this regard, the Haitian authorities
have developed a national targeting tool and
are in the process of establishing a national
registry of beneficiaries. Both of these mea­
sures will improve the efficiency and effec­
tiveness of social protection programs. In a
second stage, the coverage of social safety
nets could be increased, especially among
Priorities

households with children, while ensuring
sound targeting and improving the quality
of relevant programs, particularly those able
to enhance human capital.

Data Gaps
The SCD has highlighted a number of data
gaps that would call for attention:
• Consolidation and access to timely fiscal
data: tighter financing constraints make it
even more urgent to track public spend­
ing appropriately. Differences in budget
classifications and the absence of an effec­
tive single treasury account lead to a frag­
mentation of fiscal data and prevents a
comprehensive monitoring of public
spending from budget appropriation to
payment.
• A new census: the last census dates back to
2003. Many events have taken place since,
and the dynamics and location of people
may have substantially changed. Without
knowing the size of the country’s popula­
tion and its distribution across the national
territory, it is very difficult to design and
cost any public policy.

• Employment and labor productivity: a bet­
ter understanding of the dynamics of job
creation and the factors behind low labor
productivity is needed, especially in the in­
formal sector.
• Agriculture census: the last census dates back
from 2008. A better idea of what is pro­
duced where and factors preventing peo­
ple moving out of subsistence farming is
needed.
• Single registry of beneficiaries: the social
protection system in Haiti is fragmented
and lacks transparency. A single registry
of beneficiaries is needed to improve the
efficiency of the system through a better
targeting of its beneficiaries.
• Survey on governance and corruption: the
survey measures the perception of corrup­
tion and governance from households, pub­
lic servants, the private sector, and NGOs,
but the last one dates back to 2007.
Rebasing the National Accounts and revis­
ing the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM): the
most recent available SAM dates back to 1986.
Haiti’s economic structure has evolved and
a better understanding of its current intersectoral linkages is needed.

Notes
1. While it is implicitly assumed that a one-unit
improvement in closing a large gap demands
less effort than an equivalent one-unit im­
provement in a small gap, this might not nec­
essarily be the case. Our exercise hence does
not explicitly take into account the costs or
efforts of closing this gap.
2. These stylized facts, or parts of them, have
been discussed with the authorities and vari­
ous stakeholders, particularly at the Conference
on Growth and Employment organized by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance in Portau-Prince on March 17, at the Central Bank’s
Priorities

37th Anniversary Conference on June 9 and at
the launch of the Competitive Industries and
Innovation Program Training Program at the
Limonade Campus on June 17. These facts were
also presented to representatives of the private
sector on May 19, at the occasion of the 35th
Haitian Business Delegation visit to Washington
DC. They have also served to frame the discus­
sions with the government, donors, and the rep­
resentatives of the private sector during the MD
and the RVP’s recent visit to Haiti, July 7–9, 2014.
3. The Community Social Worker Initiative
(KORE FANMI) is a pilot program of the
85

Haitian Government, established with World
Bank financing in partnership with a number
of United Nations agencies such as UNICEF.
This program seeks to harmonize and improve
the provision of basic services to poor and vul­
nerable families, such as access to education,

86

vaccines, and latrines, with a view to moving
away from a national fragmented and unequal
system to one of systematic coverage focusing
on the rights and needs of families.
4. This work is being done as part of the ongoing
Public Expenditure Review.

Appendix A: Price Comparison Analysis
The price comparison analysis uses three
data sources to explore whether food prices in
Haiti are higher than other countries from
Latin America and the Caribbean region (as
well as North America): (a) “Numbeo,” an on­
line database of user contributed data on cost
of living, (b) Ministry of Economy and Finance
of Haiti and (c) FAO GIEWS Food Price Data.
The first database applies a common
methodology in gathering price data across
countries, thus strengthening the comparabil­
ity of price information used in this analysis.
However, since price data for Haiti is only avail­
able for 2014 at “Numbeo,” this only ­allows for
cross-section analysis. Data provided by the
Haitian Ministry of Economy and Fi­nance on
Haitian prices for 2010–2013 is com­bined with
“Numbeo” data for the panel data analysis.
Finally, for additional robustness, the analysis
is replicated with prices from the FAO
GIEWS database for the available food prod­
uct (rice).

Appendix A: Price Comparison Analysis

The baseline empirical specification for
the price comparison analysis follows the
equation: Ln(Priceijt) = β1GDPit + β2Ln(Xit) +
β3Haiti + ηj + δt + εijt
where: i = country; j = product; t = year;
Xit = GDP per capita, cost of imports, and
­duties imports (as control variables); and
ηj = product fixed effects. The Haiti dummy
variable captures the relative price levels in
Haiti compared to the average across other
countries after adjusting for the differences
in per capita GDP PPP, import costs, cus­
toms duties, and product type as well as
time-specific effects.
The food products were selected based
on availability across databases, the rele­
vance in the Haitians consumption basket
and product characteristics. For example,
products were selected that are relatively
similar (or homogeneous) across countries
in order to minimize the differences associ­
ated with product differentiation.
