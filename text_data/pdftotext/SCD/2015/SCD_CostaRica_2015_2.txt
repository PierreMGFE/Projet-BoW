COSTA RICA’S DEVELOPMENT MODEL:
ENDURING DEMOCRACY, THE SOCIAL
COMPACT, OPEN ECONOMY, AND THE
GREEN TRADEMARK

also played a key role in the Esquipulas
Agreements that set the basis for the
pacification of Central America.
Likewise, the country’s Social Compact
traces its roots back to the middle of the
20th century. Many of the central tenets of
the Social Compact were instituted during the
1940s–50s, including: (i) enacting the Labor
Code and establishing a professional civil
service isolating civil servants from changes
in the Executive; (ii) guaranteeing basic
social rights in the Constitution and adopting
basic welfare legislation; (iii) establishing a
universal health care system under the Costa
Rican Social Security Agency; and (iv)
guaranteeing public education for all. This
ambitious Social Compact has had the
backing of high and rising social spending.
Spending on education, health, and social
protection started to rise in the 1950s,
reaching over three percent of GDP by 1958,
nearly ten percent by the end of the 1990s,
and then doubling during the first decade of
the 2000s. At 20.8 percent of GDP in 2012,
Costa Rica’s social spending is one of the
highest in Latin America and on par with
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries.

Sometimes referred to as the “Switzerland
of Latin America,” Costa Rica stands out
for being among the most politically stable,
progressive,
prosperous,
and
environmentally conscious nations in the
region. This model has brought important
economic, social, and environmental
dividends, with sustained growth, upward
mobility for a large share of the population,
important gains in social indicators, and
significant achievements in reforestation and
conservation. Perhaps most important, the
country experienced shared prosperity, with
strong income growth of the bottom 40
percent for many years, and poverty rates in
Costa Rica are among the lowest in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
Indeed, Costa Rica has had uninterrupted
democratic regimes since 1953, making it
the oldest working democracy in Latin
America. Following a two-month civil war
in 1948, the Legislative Assembly was
democratically elected to draft a new
Constitution.
The
post–civil
war
administration also abolished the army, and
ever since Costa Rica has instead relied on a
police force to maintain order. In 1953, the
first presidential elections under the new
Constitution were held, and since then the
country has held 15 additional elections (the
last in 2014), widely considered peaceful and
transparent. The country was not only an
island of peace at a time when armed conflict
was predominant in Central America but it

And the Social Compact has achieved
many successes, particularly in the
delivery of universal services. Costa Rica’s
trademark universal and integrated health
care system, managed by the Costa Rican
Social Security Agency (Caja Costarricense
de Seguro Social, CCSS) has provided access
to health care to its entire population,
including the poor and bottom 40 percent. It
is widely recognized that this health care
ix

system, combined with the expansion of safe
water and sanitation, are the key reasons
behind Costa Rica’s impressive health
outcomes: life expectancy at birth improved
from 61.6 years in 1960 to 72.5 years in 1980
and to 79.7 years in 2012, similar to the
OECD average of 80.7 years. Almost 100
percent of all births are attended by skilled
medical personnel, and the infant mortality
rate has fallen from 90 to 10.6 deaths per
1,000 live births. The social security and
pension system has also been quite inclusive,
and today most of the population is covered
by at least one of the programs, which have
been extended throughout the country and
include contributory pensions, social
pensions, workers’ compensation, and
numerous social assistance benefits. Finally,
the country has also shown a strong
commitment to investing in education, nearly
reaching the spending targets of eight percent
of GDP that were approved by the Assembly
in 2010. The literacy rate for adults 15 years
old and above is almost universal (97
percent), and the share of adults 25 years and
above who had no formal education has
declined from 21.2 percent in 1950 to 3.4
percent today. Younger cohorts are also
attaining more years of education as time
goes by; for example, the cohort 25–29 years
old had only about four years of education on
average in 1950; in 1980 it had on average a
complete primary education (above six
years), and in 2010 it had a complete basic
education (nine years on average).

reliable framework for Costa Rica’s trade
with the United States as its main trading
partner, introduced changes to the legal
framework to promote transparency, ensured
a secure and predictable environment for
investors, and led to the breakup of
government monopolies in the telecom and
insurance sectors. Following CAFTA-DR,
Costa Rica has entered into further trade
agreements with Canada, China, The
European Union, Mexico, Peru, and
Singapore, thus consolidating its open
economy. Another key building block of the
economic model was the passage of the Free
Trade Zones (FTZ) law in 1981, which
started a wave of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) into the country: first with low-tech
sectors (textiles), and gradually attracting
companies in high-tech sectors (electronics,
advanced manufacturing, medical devices
and life sciences, and services for export).
This
outward-oriented
development
model has been successful in attracting
FDI and moving Costa Rica up the global
value chains over the past two decades. The
development model has transformed the
country from a rural agriculture-based
economy in the mid-1950s to one with high
value-added industries that contribute to
several global value chains. By 2014, FTZs
accounted for 53 percent of exports, and
Costa Rica’s economy is very intensive in
FDI (5.4 percent of GDP). In this regard, the
decision by Intel to set up a semi-conductor
assembly and test plant in Costa Rica in 1996
was clearly a turning point in attracting
foreign investors. Indeed, after Intel, other
well-known multinationals such as Abbott
Laboratories (now Hospira), Baxter
Healthcare, and Procter and Gamble have
invested in the country; and by the late 1990s
manufacturing and services had overtaken
agriculture in their contribution to GDP.
Costa Rica’s exports are well diversified with
high-tech manufacturing and services
playing an increasingly important role. Costa

Costa Rica’s economy has been
transformed by its outward-oriented
policies. Trade openness has been a critical
building block of this model, dating back to
1963, when Costa Rica joined the Central
American Common Market and to Costa
Rica’s membership in the Caribbean Basin
Initiative in 1983. But perhaps the most
significant step was joining the Central
America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTADR), which provided a more stable and
ii

Rica contributes to at least five major hightech global value chains: electronics, medical
devices, automotive, aeronautic/aerospace,
and film/broadcasting devices. Electronics,
medical devices, and other manufactured
goods now make up about 60 percent of
goods exports. The increasingly diversified
agricultural portfolio (bananas, pineapples,
coffee, etc.) accounts for most other goods
exports, while low value-added products
such as textiles are losing their relevance.
Services exports (tourism, business services)
also play an important role in the economy
and have also diversified. Business services
(mainly Information and Communication
Technology, ICT, related) account for almost
half of all services exports.

tourism clearly is part of Costa Rica’s
attractions, eco-tourism (an area where it has
been a pioneer) is also very popular with
many travelers visiting the national parks and
protected areas. Moreover, the country
typically ranks at the top of the Latin
American Region Travel and Tourism
Competitive Index compiled annually by the
World Economic Forum to measure the
factors that make a destination attractive for
the travel and tourism industry.
These hallmarks of Costa Rica’s
development model have produced clear
economic and social dividends—and
poverty rates are among the lowest in
Latin America and the Caribbean. GDP
per capita has tripled since 1960 and now
stands at US$13,876 (current PPP. Growth
has averaged 4.5 percent between 2000 and
2013, above the Latin American average of
3.8 percent. Using a US$4 poverty line, only
12 percent of the country’s population is
considered to be poor (less than half the Latin
American average). Taking a US$2.5 poverty
line, only 4.7 percent of the population is
poor (or about one-third of the Latin
American average). Moreover, only 1.4
percent of the population lives under the
US$1.25 poverty line, well below the World
Bank Group’s Twin Goals poverty objective
for 2030. Not surprisingly, the middle class
has become the largest socioeconomic group
of the country, comprising about 47 percent
of the population.

Finally, Costa Rica has also built a worldrenowned “Green Trademark” centered
on conservation, reforestation, and
national parks. It is the only tropical country
in the world that has reversed deforestation,
increasing the area covered by forests from
26 percent in 1983 to 52 percent today.
Reforestation is attributed, in part, to Costa
Rica’s Payments for Environmental Services
(PES) program, which provides incentives
for forest conservation and rehabilitation of
an average of 310,000 hectares per year of
privately owned lands over the past decade.
National parks and protected areas comprise
26 percent of land area in Costa Rica, and
they have become an important destination
for tourists. Costa Rica also stands out as the
only country in Latin America that has
adopted the goal of achieving carbon
neutrality by 2021.

However, despite these impressive
achievements, there are a number of
emerging challenges that will need to be
addressed to maintain the country’s
successful development path.

Indeed, the country is one of the most
visited nations in Latin America. In 2013,
close to 2.5 million tourists visited the
country. This implies that the number of
visitors per capita (at around 0.5) is above
popular destinations in the Caribbean basin
such as Mexico (0.2), or the Dominican
Republic (0.38). While sun-and-beach

First, despite reasonable growth and a
strong commitment to the Social Compact,
poverty reduction has stagnated and
inequality is rising. The long-term trend
suggests rising or stagnating inequality
iii

across most of the past 25 years, in stark
contrast to the significant decline in
inequality in the broader LAC region. More
recently, the gap between the rich and poor
has widened significantly since the global
crisis. Although growth recovered promptly
after the global crisis, above the regional
average, job creation for low-skilled workers
has been feeble, contributing to rising
unemployment and pushing returns to higher
education upwards. Growth has been uneven,
with lower growth and job creation in sectors
that are more likely to employ unskilled
workers (e.g., construction and agriculture).
Not surprisingly, inequality has increased,
with the widening gap between the earnings
of rich and poor workers mirroring large
disparities in human capital and educational
attainment. Moreover, despite high spending
on social protection benefits and the broader
Social Compact, taxes and transfers have not
proven to be effective in redistributing
income to compensate for these disparities.
Consequently, rising inequality offset the
poverty-reducing impact of growth in the late
2000s, and reversed what should have been a
decline in poverty between 2010 and 2014,
with poverty increasing by 0.4 percentage
points instead of falling by a projected three
percentage points during the post-crisis
“recovery” period.

Rica from joining the top growth performers.
These productions costs are affected by
relatively high wages that limit the country
competitiveness in low value added sectors,
as well as by a number of investment-climate
related factors such as rising electricity costs,
weak infrastructure, and burdensome
regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to
undermine the sustainability of the
country’s Social Compact and Green
Trademark, and prevent it from
undertaking much needed investments in
public infrastructure. Without fiscal
consolidation, the deficit could push public
debt to unsustainable levels and threaten the
country’s
economic,
social,
and
environmental gains. The fiscal situation has
deteriorated substantially since the global
crisis, with the overall deficit of the Central
Government growing to 5.6 percent of GDP
in 2013, and is projected to have surpassed
six percent in 2014 and to reach 6.6 in 2015.
In tandem, public debt increased from 25
percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent in 2013,
with projections of 63 percent by 2019 unless
corrective measures are implemented. This
recent deterioration stems from countercyclical measures under-taken during the
crisis and structural forces that will require
actions on multiple fronts.

Second, Costa Rica has not converged to
countries of higher income, such as the US.
Unlike the top regional performers (Chile,
Panama, and Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per
capita GDP had not shown any signs of
convergence towards the US level in the last
25 years. For example, in 1990, Costa Rica
per capita income was 13 percent of the US
level, approximately as it is today. At the
same time, the per capita GDP of Chile,
Panama, and Uruguay have increased form
13, 12 and 9 percent of the US per capita GDP
in 1990 to 21, 17 and 17 percent today
respectively. Production costs that weaken
the country’s competitiveness prevent Costa

Moreover, the current political landscape
and institutional framework add an
additional layer of complexity for
approving and implementing key reforms
needed to address these emerging
challenges. The shift from a two-party to a
multi-party system in the last fifteen years
has resulted in more complex and lengthy
reform processes. The delays and difficulties
in passing comprehensive and meaningful
reforms, particularly on sensitive issues such
as tax reform, has resulted in a mismatch
between the demands of the population and
the “political delivery”. This is an increasing

adapt quickly to changing global
developments.
Likewise,
capacity
constraints, related to weak sectoral planning
and bureaucratic inefficiencies, also affect
the ability of the public sector to implement
policies and execute public investment
projects.

The recent changes in the income distribution
are also apparent when looking at the
evolution of the incomes of the bottom 40
percent of the population, which grew about
two percentage points less than the mean
income growth between 2010 and 2012. The
stubbornly high inequality level not only
offset the poverty-reducing impacts of
growth in the late 2000s, but also reversed
what should have been a decline in poverty of
about three percentage points between 2010
and 2014, into a poverty increase of 0.4
percentage points.

INCLUSION: INEQUALITY, JOBS, AND
SKILLS
Despite its progressive social policies and
in contrast to the trends in the Latin
American region, inequality is rising in
Costa Rica. Long-term trends over different
periods indicate that inequality has either
increased or remained flat since the late
1980s. Changes in household survey
methodologies
create
problems
of
comparability over time.1 During the period
from 1989 to 2000, the Gini measure of
inequality averaged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in
1989 to 0.48 by 2000. During the period from
2001 to 2009, the Gini fell and then rose
again, averaging 0.50 across the period.
Inequality has risen in recent years, averaging
0.52 during the period from 2010 to 2014,
which corresponds both to a revised
household survey and the post-crisis
recovery. In contrast, the rest of Latin
America witnessed a marked decline in
inequality, with the regional average falling
by five points, from 0.57 in 2000 to 0.52 in
2012. As a result, Costa Rica has gone from
being the least unequal country in LAC after
Uruguay in 2000, to being around the median
country out of 17 countries for which
internationally comparable data exist for
2012.

The widening income gap between the top
and bottom quintiles of the population
reflects the mismatch between the pattern
of growth and employment versus the
skills profile of the workforce. As discussed
above, Costa Rica’s outward-oriented
economic model has
favored the
development of high value-added sectors,
such as electronics, medical devices, IT
business services, and so forth. In contrast,
lower value-added sectors, such as
construction, domestic services, and
agriculture, have grown more slowly—or
even contracted. Costa Rica’s push toward
high-end sectors has been quite successful. It
has also created excess demand for skilled
workers, increasing their market value. And
yet, Costa Rica has not sufficiently increased
its stock of high-skilled workers.
Surprisingly, despite the long-standing
commitment to invest in public education,
less than half of the cohort 25–29 years old
had achieved a secondary or higher education
by 2010, further adding to the stock of lowskilled adult workers, a legacy of the 1980s
crisis. Costa Rica’s educational attainment is
lower than in peer countries in LAC (such as
Chile and Panama), and significantly lower

Moreover, the incomes of the bottom 40
percent have fallen behind in recent years.

The long-term trends in poverty and inequality are
subject to caveats regarding income measurement due
to several changes in survey methodology across that
time period. The main “breaks” in comparability of the

data series occur in 2001 and 2010. As such,
measurement of welfare across the three time periods
of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–14 is not strictly
comparable. See Chapter 2 and Box 2.1.

than peer countries in Europe (such as
Croatia and Lithuania), and far lower than
graduation rates in the OECD. Moreover,
indicators of the quality of education, such as
OECD’s PISA or UNESCO’s TERCE tests,
place Costa Rican students behind most
countries with spending at comparable levels.
Even more worrisome, scores on
international tests have worsened in recent
years. Thus, the shift from low to high valueadded sectors without a corresponding
increase in the stock of skilled workers has
produced the same result on the distribution
of income as Skill-Biased Technological
Change—where low-skilled labor is
gradually replaced by capital. And yet, with
low graduation rates, the stock of unskilled
workers continues to grow.

earnings of those in the top quintile increased
relative to the median earner (from 2 to 2.19),
whereas the earnings of workers in the
bottom quintile fell in relation to the median
(from 0.52 to 0.29). A similar picture is seen
in disparities by skill levels: for workers with
tertiary education, the ratio to the median
income increased (from 1.89 to 2.01),
whereas the ratio for workers with secondary
complete or incomplete remained flat, and for
workers with primary education or less the
ratio fell (from 0.79 to 0.73 of the median
income). Indeed, the returns to education
have increased alongside the rise in
inequality in Costa Rica, in contrast to trends
in most other LAC countries.
Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s
ambitious Social Compact, taxes and
transfers have not proven to be effective in
redistributing income to compensate for
these disparities. This is explained by two
main factors. First, although revenue
collection in Costa Rica is on par with uppermiddle- and high-income countries (at
around 22 percent of GDP for general taxes
plus social security contributions and other
revenues), general tax revenues are low (13.5
percent of GDP), and the taxation structure is
not very progressive. Since 1953, the
Assembly has approved 1,259 tax
exemptions (nearly half of them with unclear
definitions of the taxes exempted),
amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP. Hence, the
country has a limited ability to
counterbalance income inequality through
tax policies. Second, social assistance
programs in Costa Rica are fragmented, with
fairly low coverage among the poor and weak
targeting accuracy. Even the most
widespread program (school meals) reaches
only half of the population in the lowest
income quintile. A large share of the non-poor
benefit from social programs, and the
targeting accuracy of programs is low
compared to other countries. For example,
only 44 percent of Costa Rica’s conditional

The labor-market effects of this structural
mismatch of skills and jobs have become
even more pronounced since the global
crisis. Job creation in sectors that employ
mostly low-skilled labor has been low or
negative since 2007. Unemployment started
to rise during the global crisis and has
continued increasing thereafter, reaching
nine percent in 2014. The poor, women, and
youth have been disproportionately affected
in their inability to find jobs, as the sectors
where job creation has been minimal or even
negative in the last six years are those mainly
employing low-skilled workers. Thus, it is no
surprise that unemployment increased the
most for this segment of workers. At the other
end of the spectrum, sectors that employ
mostly high-skilled workers, such as
financial services, real estate, personal
services, and others, are growing fast,
pushing returns to higher levels of education
upward.
As such, the earnings gaps between rich
and poor and between the skilled and
unskilled have widened since the
“inflection point” of the global crisis.
Specifically, between 2007 and 2013, the
vi

Program.

has put upward pressure on the salaries of
high-skilled workers.
And second, numerous investmentclimate-related factors hinder Costa
Rica’s competitiveness. Rising electricity
costs, high logistics costs, and burdensome
regulations, plus the appreciation of the real
exchange rate over the past eight years, are
eroding
the
country’s
external
competitiveness. Combined with high wage
costs, these costs have made the country less
competitive in low value-added sectors. For
example, textile exports have dropped
dramatically over the last decade, falling
from 13.3 percent of exports in 2000 to 1.6
percent in 2014, and this trend has been
mainly attributed to high production costs in
Costa Rica compared to neighboring
countries. Although Costa Rica has excelled
in its push towards high value-added sectors,
weak infrastructure outside the Free Trade
Zones and low backward links between
export-oriented multi-national corporations
and local firms have limited potential
spillover effects to the broader economy. The
quality of transport services and road and port
infrastructure in particular is relatively weak.
The appreciating real exchange rate has also
had negative consequences for exports and
the tourism sector, as well as for FDI coming
into or exiting the country. For example, in
2014, Intel’s announcement to relocate its
microchip manufacturing plant to Vietnam,
and Bank of America’s subsequent
announcement of the closing of its service
center, have sparked renewed dialogue about
the importance of diversifying exports and
improving competitiveness. Although Intel
has maintained its engineering and design
services in Costa Rica, exports of electronics
contracted by almost 20 percent in 2014.
Still, export diversification has helped, and
strong growth in medical device production
has helped offset this contraction in
electronics.

GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS
Costa Rica’s average growth performance
has been positive over the past decades. As
discussed above, GDP per capita has tripled
since 1960 against a 260 percent increase in
the region. Growth has averaged 4.5 percent
between 2000 and 2013, above the Latin
American average of 3.8 percent. Looking at
the post global-crisis period, the country’s
economy recovered similarly to a set of
comparator countries (Chile, Croatia,
Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama, and
Uruguay). Yet, as discussed above the
country since 1990 the country has not shown
any sign of convergence towards the US per
capita income levels in contrast to the top
performers in the Latin American region.
Importantly, the country faces several
challenges to its competitiveness, and the
economy is showing signs of built-up
vulnerabilities. These constraints reflect two
forces: the mismatch of skills and jobs, and
investment-climate related factors.
First, relatively high wages have made
Costa Rica less viable in low value-added
sectors, while insufficient supply of skills
hampers competitiveness in high valueadded sectors. On the one hand, high income
levels, coupled with generous social benefits,
have resulted in high reservation wages
across the board. Relatively high wages have
made the country less competitive in low
value-added sectors. On the other hand, the
push toward high value-added sectors such as
electronics, medical devices, and IT services
has been quite successful; but insufficient
supply of high-skilled workers has created
excess demand for high skills. This, in turn,

SUSTAINABILITY: FISCAL, SOCIAL, AND
ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES

Indeed, there are tensions between the
high level of social spending and Costa
Rica’s ability to deliver on its ambitious
Social Compact. In health, despite the
country’s long-standing commitment to
universal coverage, important “cracks in the
system” reduce the efficiency of this
cornerstone of the Social Compact. The
current organization of the system has led to
increasing wait times and patient frustration.
Out-of-pocket spending has increased
alongside rising public spending on health,
and budget allocations do not take into
account demographic and demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies and inequities of
health care. Furthermore, an outdated
infrastructure and information management
system lowers quality and decreases
transparency and efficiency of resource
management. In education, outcomes have
been particularly disappointing, despite high
public spending. Dropout rates are high, test
scores are low, and the system is not
producing the skills needed to meet the
demands implied by Costa Rica’s pattern of
growth. Finally, despite high coverage of the
social protection system, different pension
regimes exacerbate inequities and social
assistance programs are fragmented and
weakly targeted, with limited impacts on
poverty and inequality. In the face of rising
inequality combined with the deterioration of
the fiscal situation, these inefficiencies erode
support for the Social Compact. There are
growing signs that the middle and upper
classes are slowly starting to “opt out” of
public services and pay for private ones (as is
widespread in other Latin American
countries). To the extent that this process
continues, it will seriously undermine the
commitment of these groups to finance
universal services that they no longer use,

Sustainability is threatened by the
deteriorating fiscal situation. As in many
other countries, Costa Rica faced the global
crisis by implementing countercyclical fiscal
policies. This was welcomed given the
magnitude of the crisis and the fiscal space
the country had at the time (public debt was
below 25 percent of GDP in 2008). However,
these policies created structural pressures on
the country’s fiscal accounts: unlike other
countries which implemented temporary
fiscal policies, Costa Rica chose to
implement steep, permanent increases in
public salaries in 2008–2010. As a result, the
wage bill of the central government increased
from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4
percent in 2014. At the same time, however,
government revenues, which had risen
steeply prior to the crisis, dropped back to the
average level for 2000–05. Thus, the overall
deficit of the central government grew,
reaching 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and it
is projected to surpass six percent of GDP in
2014, and reach 6.6 percent of GDP in 2015.
As a result, public debt increased by 12
percentage points in five years, reaching 37
percent of GDP in 2013, and is projected to
surpass the somewhat worrisome level of 63
percent of GDP by 2019, unless corrective
measures to control expenditures and/or
increase revenues
are implemented.
However, such measures are constrained by a
number of rigidities in the system, including
numerous expenditure mandates, earmarked
revenues, and tax exemptions. These
rigidities leave only five percent of the annual
budget for strategic allocative decisions in
any given year. Furthermore, the budget
process is fragmented, with only the central
government budget requiring approval by the
Legislative Assembly. Without fiscal
consolidation, the deficit could push public

growth, and sustainability), there is an
additional one that cuts across the pillars:
a public sector administration that has not
modernized in tandem with the economy,
therefore limiting the State’s ability to
deliver. Despite Costa Rica’s good standing
on governance relative to the LAC region,
both perceptions and evidence suggest that its
institutions and procedures have not been
able to adapt to the challenges of a new
economic
and
social
environment.
Governance challenges hamper Costa Rica’s
effectiveness in several ways. First, in a
governance structure where power is spread
across many actors, political gridlock has
hampered the adoption of reforms in many
instances over the past decade(s). As a result,
a consequence of this gridlock in passing
reforms has been the proliferation of an
increasing number of public (and often
autonomous) institutions created to address
specific problems. Second, the budget
process
and
numerous
earmarked
expenditures reduce the margin for the
executive to control public investment and
current expenses – or to make strategic
allocative decisions. Third, public investment
– particularly in infrastructure – has been at a
standstill for decades. Various factors are
named as obstacles to the implementation of
public infrastructure and social projects in the
various line ministries, such as the
cumbersome processes associated with the
Public Procurement Law, deficiencies in the
environmental
regulatory
framework,
cumbersome checks and reviews throughout
the process, and so forth. Fourth, perception
and evidence suggest inefficiencies in public
service delivery (as discussed below for basic
social services). And finally, the institutional
complexity of the public sector makes for
convoluted procedures that increase
transactions costs of interacting with public
institutions and service agencies. The
relatively poor ranking of Costa Rica in the
Doing Business Indicators (ranking 83rd out

Similarly, Costa Rica’s global leadership
in environmental conservation faces the
challenge of growing pressures on the use
of resources and of urbanization. First, the
Payment for Environmental Service (PES)
model competes with rising land use
opportunity costs, which makes it fiscally
unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore,
the commitment to carbon neutrality entails
not only maintaining the current levels of
forest cover but also reducing the current
levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from all sectors. While a large share of GHG
emissions can be achieved from better
management of forested and agricultural
land, the country also needs to reduce carbon
emissions from fossil fuels coming from
transport,
from
construction,
and
increasingly from general electricity
consumption. This creates significant tradeoffs: the PES model is itself dependent on
revenues generated from taxes on gasoline;
and increasing the production of clean energy
necessitates in some cases intervening in
protected areas. Second, urbanization has
increased air and water pollution, and there is
no long-term plan to protect the environment
from these threats. The country needs to
improve its infrastructure quality, from
public transportation to waste treatment
capabilities. Finally, the intensive use of
agricultural land has generated a worrisome
level of agro-chemical use, and more
generally the lack of a proactive approach to
territorial planning jeopardizes the gains in
environmental conservation. Put differently,
the status quo is at odds with the long-term
goals of the country in terms of
environmental sustainability.
GOVERNANCE

On top of the challenges affecting the three
basic pillars of development (inclusion,
ix

of 189 countries in 2015) is partly attributed
to burdensome procedures within and
between public institutions. Costa Rica also
ranks poorly on indices of Protecting
Investors (181st), Enforcing Contracts
(129th), Paying Taxes (121st) and Starting a
Business (118th). It’s startling that a country
that depends so heavily on FDI fares so
poorly in those categories.

PRIORITY

COMPLEMENTARITIES

LINKS,

building a more skilled workforce will ensure
that the country remains competitive in high
value-added sectors, and that more workers
can access these better paying jobs, including
those in the bottom 40 percent of the
population. As these changes are structural,
for the most part they are also long term in
nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an
education overnight.” As such, tackling these
challenges will require a three-pronged
approach: (i) strengthening the quality,
retention, and relevance of the education
system (from pre-school through secondary
school)—which will help build the skills of
“tomorrow’s workers”; (ii) improving the
quality and relevance of tertiary education;
and (ii) strengthening the technical training
system for the workforce.

AND

Several threads weave across this “trilogy”
of challenges for inclusion, growth, and
sustainability—and point to priority areas
for action. One thread involves the
interactions between inequality and growth,
which hinge on the mismatch of skills and
jobs. Another strand is the dual challenge of
maintaining competitiveness of high valueadded sectors, while enhancing the viability
of traditional low value-added sectors.
Mounting fiscal pressures threaten the
sustainability of the Social Compact and
Green Trademark. Finally, the challenges of
governance also weave across the
development agenda, limiting the capacity of
the public sector to adopt reforms, deliver
services, and execute infrastructure projects.
These inter-connected challenges highlight a
number of priority areas that Costa Rica
needs to address to continue on a sustainable
and inclusive growth path.

Bold actions are needed to overhaul Costa
Rica’s education system. Given the
country’s level of development and high
education spending, the education system
seriously underperforms in quality (as
demonstrated by test results), retention (low
completion rates), and relevance (as
indicated by low returns to training and lower
levels of education). Although high rates of
secondary school dropout are a symptom of
the broader challenges in the system,
imbalances in the allocation of public
spending favor primary (41 percent) and
tertiary education (32 percent) with relatively
little allocated to the secondary level (27
percent). Indeed, both the share of public
spending and the allocation per student in
secondary education are low by international
standards and given Costa Rica’s level of
development. Moreover, inequities in
learning outcomes start early in life—and
affect motivation and abilities to learn
throughout the school years. In addition to
rebalancing spending towards secondary
school and early childhood development,
Costa Rica needs to strengthen teacher
quality and improve accountability through
regular monitoring with standardized

EDUCATION AND SKILLS. Costa Rica
needs to build a skilled workforce to
supports its trajectory towards a high
value-added economy and to reduce the
skills-income gap. With fewer than half of
young adults graduating from secondary
school, and with performance on test scores
falling, Costa Rica’s labor supply does not
appear to be well adapted to generate the
skills needed for the labor market. Thus,

linkages could sustain the growth among
small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
generating jobs in mid- and low-skilled
occupations. This can be done by lowering
operation costs to improve the productivity of
labor and counterbalance the high labor costs
in Costa Rica compared to its neighbors, for
example by lowering the costs of doing
business through regulatory simplification.

Given the high-skilled profile of job
opportunities in Costa Rica, systemic
efforts are also needed to enhance the
quality and relevance of tertiary
education. Currently, the tertiary education
system is heavily biased towards social
science and humanities, and produces few
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics) graduates, further
contributing to the skills shortage in high
value-added sectors. Moreover, outdated and
bureaucratic procedures for recognizing
foreign degrees create obstacles for Costa
Rica to “import” the skills needed to sustain
its high value-added growth model. Quality
and accountability mechanisms are also
needed, with performance agreements with
public universities and quality accreditation
standards for both university and nonuniversity tertiary education

INFRASTRUCTURE.
Reducing
the
infrastructure deficit would increase
competitiveness,
growth,
and
environmental sustainability. Costa Rica’s
historical efforts to build an extensive
network of infrastructure in nearly all
productive service areas (water, sanitation,
transport,
electricity,
and
telecommunications) are clear from the
infrastructure stock: the country has two
times the road and three times the rail density
of the average middle-income country;
access to electricity is nearly universal; and
mobile penetration is higher than the OECD
average. Yet, the near freeze in public
infrastructure investment until the 1990s, as
well as recent fiscal constraints, have taken a
toll on the country’s ability to upgrade and
maintain its infrastructure. Further, the
government has faced significant challenges
in executing infrastructure investment in a
timely manner. As a result, today roads and
ports have among the lowest quality marks in
the LAC region. Electricity prices have
doubled since 2007 due to weather related
variable hydroelectric output, causing
increased use of thermal units and high
operating costs, among other factors. This
infrastructure deficit reduces the potential of
local firms to grow and create jobs, and this
is true in particular for firms that operate
outside Free Trade Zones (FTZs). In addition,
the country needs to improve its waste
management and clean energy production
capabilities to be able to reduce GHG
emissions, and water and soil pollution.
Infrastructure improvement poses a number

Finally, the country needs to expand the
offering and relevance of technical
training, which is the most direct way to
build the skills of the current workforce.
Again,
stronger
quality
standards,
certification of technical programs, and
accountability of training institutes could
help. The National Learning Institute (INA)
could also improve coordination with
private-sector employers to design marketrelevant curricula and course offerings so as
to better respond to the needs of the growing
sectors of the economy.
COMPETITIVENESS AND THE BUSINESS
CLIMATE. Boosting growth and inclusion
in the labor market requires confronting
the dual challenge of maintaining
competitiveness of high value-added
sectors, while improving the viability of
low value-added sectors. For instance,

in protected areas (in the case of clean energy
production), as well as the need to control the

continuing to invest in infrastructure, and the
reality of fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must
look for options for private sector
participation in the maintenance and
upgrading of its infrastructure.

comprehensive reform of the budgetary
process is needed to increase efficiency
and transparency in all public sector
entities.
Finally,
curtailing
the
earmarking of revenues, which cover
more than half of primary spending,
would make the budgetary process more
flexible. Comprehensive reforms are also
needed to increase revenues. For
example, the 1,259 tax exemptions
approved since 1953 that comprise
almost six percent of GDP need to be
thoroughly reviewed. Curtailing those
exemptions would make the tax system
more rational and progressive, as well as
produce higher revenues. This reform is
essential for restoring sustainability to the
fiscal accounts, which is a necessary
condition for achieving Costa Rica’s
economic and social objectives.

Both growth and inclusion would benefit
from the many complementarities
involved
in
improving
education,
competitiveness, and infrastructure. A
well-educated workforce with relevant skills
is fundamental for sustaining economic
growth and increasing productivity. In
parallel, closing the education gap between
the poor and non-poor is also highly relevant
for inclusion by providing opportunities
those in the bottom 40 percent. Lowering the
costs of doing business will boost
competitiveness across various sectors.
Furthermore,
increasing
infrastructure
spending would stimulate construction,
thereby creating more jobs for the large stock
of low-skilled workers.



At the same time, actions are needed to
ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s
development model:


FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY: Improving
the
fiscal
stance
to
restore
sustainability requires reforms to
manage expenditures and increase
revenues. On the expenditure front, these
include containing the wage bill of the
consolidated public sector, as public
sector wages, both in government and
more so in state-owned enterprises and
other public institutions, are well above
the private sector at all employment
categories; and reviewing the fiscal
sustainability of the pension system,
particularly of special pension regimes in
the public sector. In addition, a
xii

SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY: In addition
to strengthening education, priority areas
for sustaining the Social Compact
including health and social protection.
Costa Rica needs to modernize its
universal health system to improve
quality by: (i) strengthening the health
care model to enhance capacity to adapt
to demographic and epidemiological
change while ensuring quality and
timeliness of service delivery; (ii)
improving the financial model of budget
and resource allocation; and (iii)
improving the management model for the
health system for accountability,
efficiency, and performance. The country
also needs to increase the effectiveness of
social protection programs by (i)
harmonizing eligibility criteria and social
information systems; (ii) improving
performance monitoring and evaluation;
and (ii) reducing institutional and
program fragmentation.



areas,
for
instance
by
increasing
accountability in the education sector (e.g.,
by tracking student achievement to reward
teacher
and
school
performance).
Employment creation would benefit from
streamlining business regulations as well as
the public procurement and investment
processes to improve infrastructure. A more
consolidated budget, fewer tax exemptions,
and more control over spending by
autonomous institutions could greatly help to
reduce the current fiscal deficit, and would
improve the capacity to monitor results of
public spending. In turn, results-based
management would help to boost the
efficiency of public spending, for example,
enforcing the use of common information
systems and modernizing the M&E
frameworks in the social sectors.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY:
To sustain its celebrated “Green
Trademark,” Costa Rica needs to balance
environmental and natural resource
management goals, by: (i) reviewing the
sustainability of the PES mechanism for
conservation; (ii) modernizing water and
solid waste treatment (infrastructure,
service delivery, regulatory framework,
capacity); (iii) increasing the supply of
renewable energy by making regulations
on the use of protected areas more
flexible;
(iv)
implementing
a
comprehensive
transport
policy,
including measures to reduce growth of
demand for energy associated with
transport; (v) reinforcing regulation and
oversight of agro-chemical use and
incentivizing the expansion of “green”
(organic) agriculture; and (vi) improving
territorial planning, land management,
and management of natural and manmade disasters.

AN AGENDA FOR KNOWLEDGE. Finally, a
number of knowledge gaps need to be
filled to inform better policy decisions.
Although there is a large and productive
research and policy analysis community
studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues
where having further research and data
collection would provide more information to
help design more concrete policy reforms to
tackle the issues presented above. For
example, the specific factors driving
secondary dropout are still not well
understood. In the labor market, it is not clear
whether the contraction of employment in
agriculture, manufacturing and construction
is of a cyclical or structural nature, and this
has important implications for low-skilled
unemployment. Likewise, although there are
strong signs that reservation wages are high,
there could be more studies to quantify this
phenomenon better. To improve the
efficiency of the public sector, it is crucial to
identify the specific governance bottlenecks
in executing infrastructure projects, as well as
their cost implications. Also, the articulation
mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of
social programs need to be based on a

GOVERNANCE. Progress in all the priority
areas discussed above hinges on improving
the capacity of the public sector to plan
and implement policies, execute public
investment projects, deliver services, and
increase accountability. Despite Costa
Rica’s good governance levels compared to
the rest of the LAC region, there is a growing
perception of low effectiveness of
government
institutions.
Cumbersome
regulations, in many cases resulting from
lack of coordination among institutions,
make the process of starting and running a
business—particularly a non-FTZ small or
medium enterprise—more challenging. Low
levels of transparency and accountability
lower the efficiency of public spending. The
current political landscape, where political
minorities have the power to delay votes,
further reduces the margin for approving and
implementing needed reforms. The need to
improve governance is apparent in all priority

xiii

thorough institutional mapping of social
programs.
Finally,
environmental
conservation needs to be better linked with
economic activity, and a key knowledge gap
in this regard is how to link sustainable

production and
conservation.

Costa Rica is a small country, with ambitious economic, social, and environmental goals. The
country covers a land area of 19,700 square miles (51,100 square kilometers), with a population
of 4.7 million, of which about two-thirds live in urban areas. An upper-middle income-country,
with GDP per capita of US$13,876 (current PPP), it is under consideration for membership to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with discussions scheduled
for this year. Costa Rica’s development model centers on four key pillars: its long-standing
democracy, an ambitious Social Compact, an outward-oriented economy, and its celebrated Green
Trademark. This model has achieved many successes, including sustained healthy growth rates,
improvements in social indicators, environmental gains, and one of the lowest poverty rates in the
Latin America and Caribbean region.
Anchored in a region rife with political and social turmoil until the late 20th century, Costa
Rica stands out as the longest working democracy in Latin America. The country—one of the
smallest in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)—started a process of democratic nation
building back in the 19th century, with the development of the coffee industry.2 Stability and
consensus were nurtured from the country’s early years and continued during the transition to the
modern democracy that started in 1949 (Box 1.1). Since then, elections have been held every four
years, with peaceful transitions of power between political parties, making it the oldest working
democracy in Latin America. There is a clear checks-and-balances system between the Executive
and the Legislative Assembly. Costa Rica’s political norms have long placed a high premium on
achievement of wide socio-political consensus on major policies. Participation in elections remains
high, with 70 percent voting in 2010 and 68 percent in 2014, although it has declined from levels
around 80 percent during elections in the 1990s.3 This political stability, which has earned Costa
Rica the label of “Switzerland of Latin America,” has been attributed to several factors, including
the abolition of the army after a two-month civil war in 1948, the limited presence and power of
land-based oligarchies, and the 1949 Constitution, which created one of Latin America’s first
welfare states.
The country has also forged a far-reaching Social Compact, with universal access to basic
services and a long tradition of social rights. Costa Rica’s Social Compact traces its roots back
to the middle of the 20th century, and is founded on constitutional guarantees of basic social rights,
an extensive Labor Code, public education, and a universal health care system managed by the
Social Security Agency (Box 1.1). As a result, most of the population has access to improved water
sources (96 percent), sanitation (94 percent), and electricity (99 percent).4 It is widely recognized
that Costa Rica’s universal health care system, along with the expansion of safe water and
sanitation, are the key reasons behind its impressive health outcomes.5 Life expectancy at birth
increased from 61.6 years in 1960 to 79.7 years in 2012, just one year less than the OECD average

rate stands at 10.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, a vast improvement since 1960 which recorded 90
deaths per 1,000. Moreover, by 2011 the literacy rate for adults 15 years old and above had reached
97 percent, and the share of adults 25 years and above who had no formal education was 3.4 percent
in 2010. Younger cohorts are attaining more years of education as time goes by. For example, the
cohort of young adults aged 25–29 years had only about four years of education on average in
1950; in 1980 it had on average a complete primary education (six years); and by 2010 it had a
complete basic education (nine years on average). This is in part the result of a strong commitment
of the society to invest in education, as reflected in a recently approved constitutional mandate
(June 2010) to raise education spending from six to eight percent of GDP.
Box 1.1: Historical Underpinnings of Costa Rica’s Social Compact
Costa Rica’s social contract has its roots in the pattern of its colonial settlement and the structure of coffee
production. Largely isolated, sparsely populated, and without precious metals to export, Costa Rica was a
uniformly poor subsistence economy during the colonial period (1600–1800). The farmers of the Central
Valley worked their own land on homesteads. Given the dominance of the farm household, Costa Rica has
been described as a “rural democracy” during this period, with minimal social divisions and few class
distinctions, in contrast to neighboring countries.
Following independence in 1821, coffee production grew rapidly and became the engine of Costa Rica’s
economic growth. Coffee became a driver for the development of the country’s infrastructure, institutional
organization, and productive structure. Roads were built to export coffee to Europe. Coffee production
accelerated moving from communal land rights to the privatization of land, and the predominance of small
landholdings and the notion of individual property rights contributed to low inequality and shared wealth.
Abundant land supply and labor scarcity contributed to high wages, contributing to a more equitable
distribution of the income from coffee exports. As international demand increased, large exporters were
forced to buy coffee from the smallholders, while in turn smallholders depended on large exporters for the
beneficio—the hullery where coffee is washed, dried, and packaged for export—thereby creating a strong
mutual interdependence. By the middle of the 19 th century, this facilitated the consolidation of the Coffee
Pact—the implicit contract developed between the large exporters and smaller producers. In part, this pact
was feasible because Costa Rica had a small territory with a small population concentrated in the Central
Valley, where all faced the same adversities and risks. The implicit contract was a social mechanism for
dealing with these risks and overcoming the shortcomings of small size.
The social relationships implicit in the Coffee Pact gradually led to the emergence of a national egalitarian
ideology that validated the participation of small producers and the landless workers not only in the
distribution of the economy’s product but also in the political arena. This led to Costa Rica’s version of the
liberal state, in which the interests of different sectors could be democratically expressed, rules were
universally applicable, and institutions and legal codes promoted the growth of economic activity and a
democratic society. Liberal governments created a legal framework that protected individual and property
rights, guaranteed market freedom, and placed multiple limits and counterbalances on power.
This egalitarian ideology provided the underpinnings for Costa Rica’s notable Welfare State. In 1941,
President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia created the social security system (Caja Costarricense de Seguro
Social, CCSS) to provide public health services, which have become universal since then. In 1943, a Labor
Code was enacted and an article on social rights (garantías sociales) was written into the Constitution of
1949. The social rights included health, housing, social assistance, public services, taxes, and minimum
wages, among others.

Costa Rica’s economy has been transformed by its outward-oriented policies, centered on
trade openness, export diversification, Free Trade Zones (FTZs), and foreign direct investment
(FDI). Trade openness has been a critical building block of this model, dating back to 1963, when
2

Costa Rica joined the Central American Common Market (CACM, made up of El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), which spearheaded trade integration in Central America,
eventually leading to a customs union. A second milestone took place 20 years later (1983), when
Costa Rica joined the Caribbean Basin Initiative, strengthening its trade relations with the United
States. But perhaps the most significant step was joining CAFTA-DR (the Dominican RepublicCentral America-United States Free Trade Agreement), which provided a more stable and reliable
framework for Costa Rica’s trade with its main trading partner, the United States, introduced
changes to the legal framework to promote transparency, ensured a secure and predictable
environment for investors, and led to the breakup of government monopolies in the telecom and
insurance sectors. Following CAFTA-DR, Costa Rica has entered into further trade agreements
with Canada, China, the European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, thus consolidating its
open economy. Another key building block of the economic model was the passage of the Free
Trade Zones (FTZ) law in 1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010), which started a wave of FDI into
the country: first with low-tech sectors (textiles), and gradually attracting companies in high-tech
sectors (electronics, advanced manufacturing, medical devices and life sciences, and services for
export).
This outward-oriented development model has been successful in attracting FDI and moving
Costa Rica up the global value chains over the past two decades. The development model has
transformed the country from a rural agriculture-based economy in the mid-1950s to one with high
value-added industries that contribute to several global value chains. By 2014, FTZs accounted for
53 percent of exports, and Costa Rica’s economy is very intensive in FDI (4.2 percent of GDP).
Exports are well diversified with high-tech manufacturing and services playing an increasingly
important role. Costa Rica contributes to at least five major high-tech global value chains:
electronics, medical devices, automotive, aeronautic/aerospace, and film/broadcasting devices.
Electronics, medical devices, and other manufactured goods now make up about 60 percent of
goods exports. The increasingly diversified agricultural portfolio (bananas, pineapples, coffee,
etc.) accounts for most other goods exports, while low value-added products such as textiles are
losing their relevance. Services exports (tourism, business services) also play an important role in
the economy and have also diversified. Business services (mainly Information and Communication
Technology, ICT, related) account for almost half of all services exports.
Finally, Costa Rica has built a world-renowned “Green Trademark,” centered on
conservation, reforestation, and protected areas. It is the only tropical country in the world that
has reversed deforestation, increasing the area covered by forests from 26 percent in 1983 to 52
percent today (Box 1.2). Reforestation is attributed, in part, to the Payments for Environmental
Services (PES) program, which provides incentives to forest conservation and rehabilitation,
reaching an average of 310,000 hectares per year of privately owned lands over the past decade.
Costa Rica has also set aside 26 percent of its land area for protected areas, including national
parks, which have become an important destination for tourists (53 percent of tourists visited those
parks in 2012).6 Tourism has become a dynamic sector, contributing 4.6 percent of GDP and 14.2
percent of total exports in 2013. Costa Rica also stands out as the first country to adopt the goal of
achieving carbon neutrality by 2021 (Box 1.2).

6

DeShazo and Monestel Vega (1999) found that tourists spend a lot of time in those national parks.

Box 1.2: Costa Rica’s Celebrated Green Trademark
Costa Rica takes up only 0.03 percent of the earth’s surface but is considered to be one of the 20 countries
with the greatest biodiversity in the world, with 52 percent covered by forests and 26 percent in protected
areas. This was not always the case. Although more than half of the country was covered by forest in 1950,
deforestation had stripped this to just 26 percent by 1983 under the pressures of a growing population and
massive conversion of forest to pasture, underpinned by policies that supported cattle ranching and
agricultural development.
Green Framework and Payments for Environmental Services. Recognizing the potential economic and
global value of the forests and the risks to environmental degradation of rapid deforestation, several
framework laws established the basic principles of Costa Rica’s “Green Trademark” aimed at rehabilitating
wooded lands and setting aside vast areas of land as protected areas. It took years of policy debate and
consensus building to develop a national approach of paying for environmental services—which now takes
the form of the world-renowned Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program. This program builds
on a long chain of earlier legislation that made the costs of reforestation tax deductible (Forest Law No. 4475
of 1969), established reforestation as a legal imperative (Forest Law No. 6184 of 1977), and established
fiscal incentives through the creation of certificates that rewarded landowners for reforestation and allowed
for significant forest authority intervention in the use of forest resources (Forest Laws No. 7032 of 1986 and
7174 of 1990).
The PES was formally established in 1995 when the government adopted Forest Law No. 7575. This law
established a framework for payments to landowners for these ecosystem services, and established the
National Fund for Forestry Financing (Fondo Nactional de Financiamento Forestal, FONAFIFO), to manage
the PES and established a new certificate for forest conservation to reward landholders for their ecosystem
services. Besides the 1995 Forest Law, the government enacted other environmentally related laws: (i) the
1995 Environment Law No. 7554, which mandates a “balanced and ecologically driven environment for all”;
(ii) the 1996 Forest Law No. 7575, which mandates “rational use” of all natural resources and prohibits land
cover change in forests; and (iii) the 1998 Biodiversity Law, which promotes the conservation and “rational
use” of biodiversity resources and includes measures to conserve, protect, and sustainably exploit biological
resources to ensure quality of life for future generations and the survival of natural heritage. Subsequently,
the Fiscal Simplification and Efficiency Law No. 8114 (2001) fixed FONAFIFO's share of fuel tax revenues to
3.5 percent, guaranteed through the Ordinary National Budget. In addition, the Decree of the President of
the Republic No. 32868 in 2005 (“Inaugurating and Regulating a Water Charging Scheme”) introduced a
mandatory payment for ecosystem services via instituting a water tariff structure through which 25 percent
of the proceeds from water charges are allocated to the PES Program.
National Parks and Protected Areas. The National System of Protected areas was introduced in the late
1980s, followed by the National System of Conservation Areas (Sistema Nacional de Areas de Conservacion,
SINAC) was created in 1994 to organize the country into 11 large conservation areas, most of which are
based around a major national park, to avoid a situation in which the protected areas would serve as isolated
“green islands” in an otherwise improperly managed landscape. SINAC oversees over 160 protected areas,
of which 26 are designated national parks. Other areas are designated wildlife refuges, biological reserves,
national monuments, forest reserves, national wetlands, and protected zones.
Carbon Neutrality. In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intention to become 100
percent carbon neutral by 2021. Efforts are underway to begin offsetting all of the country’s carbon dioxide
emissions using a wide range of budgetary, legal, and financial incentives including measures to promote
biofuels, hybrid vehicles, and clean energy. Another key component of the national strategy will be a “CNeutral” label to certify that tourism and certain industrial practices mitigate all of the carbon dioxide they
emit. Under the new certification system, tourists and businesses would be charged a voluntary “tax” to
offset their carbon emissions, with one ton of carbon valued at US$10. The funds would be used for
conservation, reforestation, and research in protected areas.

This development model has produced clear economic and social dividends—and poverty
rates are among the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean. GDP per capita has tripled
since 1960 and now stands at US$13,876 (current PPP). Growth has averaged 4.5 percent between
2000 and 2013, above the Latin American average of 3.8 percent. Using a US$4 (2005 PPP)
poverty line, only 12 percent of the country’s population is considered to be poor (less than half of
the Latin American average). Taking a US$2.5 poverty line, only 4.7 percent of the population is
poor (or about one-third of the Latin American average). Moreover, only 1.4 percent of the
population lives under the US$1.25 poverty line, well below the World Bank Group’s Twin Goals
poverty objective for 2030.7 Not surprisingly, the middle class has become the largest
socioeconomic group of the country, comprising about 47 percent of the population.
However, despite these impressive achievements, underlying vulnerabilities challenge Costa
Rica’s development model. There is a sense that, although Costa Rica has achieved impressive
“levels” of performance for many indicators (relatively low poverty rates, long life expectancy,
near-universal literacy, environmental conservation), it is increasingly becoming constrained on
the “deltas” of adopting the changes needed to make the transition to a modern, higher-income
economy that is aspiring to join the OECD. These “cracks in the system” are apparent in many
dimensions: rising inequality; growing unemployment, especially among the poor; consistently
high school dropout rates; increasing dissatisfaction in the quality of the health care system; rising
electricity costs; a near halting of infrastructure investment; increasing air and water pollution; and
the deteriorating fiscal balance. In turn, these risks are symptoms of deeper structural problems in
the economy and the public sector. The implications of these challenges are worrisome: although
the economy is expected to continue to grow at healthy rates, poverty reduction has stagnated, the
incomes of the bottom 40 percent are falling behind, and inequality is rising.
These challenges affect the basic pillars underlying poverty reduction and shared prosperity:
inclusion, growth, and sustainability.


On the inclusion front, inequality is rising, despite the country’s progressive policies and
ambitious Social Compact—and in contrast to the marked decline in inequality in much of
the LAC region. Consequently, inequality offset the poverty-reducing impacts of growth
in the late 2000s, and reversed what should have been a decline in poverty, with poverty
increasing by 0.4 percentage points instead of falling by a projected three percentage points
during the post-crisis recovery period. The widening income gap between rich and poor
reflects changes in the labor market, weak educational outcomes, and a mismatch between
the pattern of growth and the skills profile of the workforce.



On the growth front, although Costa Rica’s growth performance over the past decades
has been positive, it has not made much headway in convergence with the United States,
lagging behind structural peer countries, such as Chile, Panama, and Uruguay. Moreover,
the country faces several challenges to its competitiveness, including the mismatch of skills
and jobs, investment-climate related factors, production costs, and weaknesses in publicsector administration. As a result, the economy is showing signs of built-up vulnerabilities.

The WBG’s Twin Goals are (i) to reduce the percentage of people living under US$1.25 per day to three percent
globally by 2030, and (ii) to increase the income growth rate for the bottom 40 percent relative to average growth,
within each country.
7

5



And finally, on the sustainability front, the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions in
the Social Compact, and various risks to the Green Trademark all combine to threaten Costa
Rica’s development model. The fiscal situation stands out as one of the most pressing
development challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent deterioration stems from a
combination of countercyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces.
Without fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push public debt to unsustainable levels and
threaten the country’s economic, social, and economic gains. Indeed, fiscal pressures, as
well as rising inequality, and increasing dissatisfaction with social services all combine to
create tensions in the social compact. Finally, Costa Rica’s leadership in environmental
conservation faces the challenge of growing pressures on the use of resources and of
urbanization. Changing economic incentives threaten the gains in reforestation, and the use
of agro-chemicals is worrisome. Urbanization has increased energy use, as well as air and
water pollution; and the country has not developed a long-term plan to protect the
environment from these threats.

This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) takes stock of Costa Rica’s path to success, and
reflects on the development constraints and opportunities that the country faces going
forward. It does so through diagnostics of the trends, drivers, and challenges to provide elements
to answer three basic questions:
1) To what extent has the Costa Rican development model been inclusive?
2) What has driven growth in Costa Rica in recent years, and what are the bottlenecks that
need to be addressed?
3) How sustainable is the development model of Costa Rica economically, socially, and
environmentally?
The SCD is organized as follows. Chapter 2 examines trends in poverty and shared prosperity.
Chapter 3 assesses the inclusiveness of growth, with a focus on the challenge of rising inequality
and the mismatch of labor opportunities and the skills of the workforce, with implications for the
poor and the bottom 40 percent of the population. Chapter 4 analyzes the drivers of growth, as well
as key constraints to growth looking forward. Chapter 5 identifies risks to the sustainability of
development, including growth, the delivery of public services, and the green trademark of the
country. Finally, based on the previous analyses and a participatory process with partners and
stakeholders in Costa Rica as well as within the WBG,8 Chapter 6 identifies priority areas for
policy to ensure that Costa Rica stays on a sustained path of growth, inclusiveness, and shared
prosperity. In several parts of the analysis, this SCD relies on comparisons with other countries,
including regional peers, structural peers, and aspirational peers (OECD countries).9

Poverty rates in Costa Rica are among the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the middle class are
the predominant group. Nonetheless, poverty increased and then stagnated during and after the global crisis.
The patterns of poverty show an uneven level of development in the country, with the Central region being more
prosperous relative to the peripheral regions. Moreover, income inequality is rising, in contrast with the
historical decline observed in most countries in Latin America. Consequently, inequality offset the povertyreducing impact of growth in the late 2000s, with poverty rising instead of declining despite economic growth.

One of the great outcomes of Costa Rica’s sustained GDP growth and Social Compact is the
reduction of poverty that took place over the second half of the 20th century. The poverty
headcount—measured with an internationally comparable poverty line of US$4 per day—was
reduced from around 40 percent in 1989 to 27 percent by the turn of the century. Poverty decreased
further to 18 percent in 2007, falling at a rate of about 1.5 percentage points per year (Figure 2.1a).
However, poverty reduction stagnated during and after the global crisis. Trends for extreme
poverty—defined internationally in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as per capita income
under US$2.50 a day—are similar, with a sustained fall from 14 percent in 2001 to seven percent
in 2007, and a slower decline after 2010 to an average of five percent.10 Costa Rica’s poverty rate
of 12 percent was the lowest in Latin American after Argentina (11 percent), Chile (10 percent),
and Uruguay (8 percent) and less than half of the LAC average in 2012.
Official poverty figures show a modest decline since the 1990s, and a stagnation of poverty
since 2010. Using the official poverty line and the per capita income aggregate, overall poverty in
Costa Rica declined from around 31 percent to 19 percent between 1989 and 2007 (Figure 2.1b).
Poverty reduction followed a cyclical pattern: after a period of sharp decline in 1989–1994, poverty
stagnated until 2000; then during the economic expansion of 2001–2007, it declined modestly at
about 0.6 percentage points per year. The global crisis reversed some of these gains, causing
poverty to increase to 21.6 in 2009; and it has remained stable during the 2010–2014 period at
around 24 percent. Extreme poverty followed a similar pattern, declining from 9.9 percent to 3.7
percent between 1989 and 2007, and then increasing to 5.2 in 2009 and to 7.1 percent by 2014. By
2014, the number of poor amounted to 1.17 million, including 0.45 million of extreme poor (Box
2.1).11

10

The rate of global extreme poverty, measured as the share of the population living with under US$1.5 per day, is
1.4 percent (2012). See World Bank Poverty and Inequality Database.

Please note that poverty rates after 2010 are not comparable to previous years due to methodological changes.

Box 2.1: How have methodological changes affected poverty measures in Costa Rica?
The analysis of trends in poverty and inequality over time must be treated with some caution due to changes
in methodologies used both for the collection of household survey data and for the calculation of poverty
lines in Costa Rica.
Two household surveys are used to measure poverty from 1989 to 2014, but they do not allow for
comparisons on poverty rates. The surveys are Encuesta de Hogares de Propositos Multiples (EHPM) up to
2009 and the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) from 2010 to 2014. Several improvements in the
methodology to estimate household incomes were introduced in the ENAHO. For example, the new
questionnaire includes more and better questions on labor and non-labor income; the consumption basket
was revised using the consumption patterns found in the 2004 National Income and Expenditure Survey;
and there were methodological changes in how to adjust for under-declaration of incomes and the
imputation of labor income.
Costa Rica uses two income-based poverty lines, one for extreme poverty and another for overall poverty.
The extreme, or “food,” poverty line is the value of the basic food basket required for an individual to meet
the minimum caloric intake. The overall poverty line considers other basic resources beyond food.
A methodological change in calculating the poverty line was also introduced with the ENAHO. Before 2010,
both components of the poverty line were adjusted using the food consumer price index (CPI). This was
likely to have resulted in overestimation of poverty when food prices were rising faster than overall prices,
as happened in 2007–2009. In 2009, for example, the poverty rate would have been 18.7 percent, about three
percentage points lower, if the non-food component of the poverty line had been updated using the general
CPI (figure B2.1.1). Since 2010, the official poverty line is adjusted using the food CPI for the food component
of the poverty line and the non-food CPI for the non-food part.
Comparing Costa Rica’s poverty rates with those of other countries presents a series of challenges, but
harmonized survey data are available for that purpose from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin

America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC). The
harmonization was developed by the Center
for Distributional Labor and Social Studies
(CEDLAS) at the University of La Plata,
Argentina, and the World Bank. The
harmonized survey data allow for crosscountry comparability of poverty and
inequality measures. However, per capita
income and poverty lines from SEDLAC differ
from official estimates. Extreme poor are
individuals with a harmonized per capita
income lower than US$2.50 a day, while poor
are individuals with a harmonized per capita
income lower than US$4 a day (2005 PPP).
International comparable data from SEDLAC
are available only up to 2012.

Spatially, poverty rates are the lowest in the Central region, as compared to the other regions.
Poverty rates vary significantly across the country (Figure 2.2a). In particular, poverty rates are as
high as 35 percent in the Brunca and Chorotega regions, as compared with 19 percent in the Central
region.
In terms of their numbers, however, the poor are concentrated in the Central Region. About
half of the 1.7 million poor Costa Ricans live in the Central region, with the other half distributed
almost evenly across the rest of the country (Figure 2.2b). The relative high concentration of poor
in the Central region mirrors population density as this region concentrates 62 percent of the
country’s now mostly urban population.

Note: The sample of the household survey allows estimating poverty in the six regions of the country: Central; Chorotega;
Pacifico Central; Brunca; Huetar Atlantica; and Huetar Norte. Poverty rates in 2001 and 2014 are not strictly comparable (see
Box 2.1). Poor are individuals with a per capita income below the official poverty line.

Regional disparities are significant, and poverty rates are much higher in the border areas.
The 2011 county-level map of income (monetary) poverty produced by INEC reveals a large
heterogeneity of poverty rates within and across regions.12 In particular, poverty rates range from
over 50 percent along the border with Nicaragua and Panama to less than 15 percent in some
counties located in the Central region (Figure 2.3a). The cantons with the highest poverty rates are
also those where most of the indigenous population lives (Box 2.2). Interestingly, the poverty map
also shows a high concentration of poor households, with almost a quarter of poor households
concentrated in only five counties in Costa Rica in 2011 (Figure 2.3b).

12

The small area estimation technique follows Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2003) and combines information from
surveys and censuses to produce estimates of monetary poverty in small geographic areas. By applying this technique,
INEC combined information from the 2011 Census together with the 2011 ENAHO survey to produce poverty rates
at the county level. For more information on the 2011poverty map visit INEC’s website (www.inec.go.cr).

Concentration of poor households, 2011

Source: Elaborated with data from the 2011 Census reported in INEC’s website (www.inec.go.cr).
Note: The figure shows the proportion and concentration of poor households in 2011. Poor are households with a per capita
income lower than the official poverty line. Since numbers refer to households instead of individuals, they differ from those
shown in Figure 2.1b.

Poor and non-poor households have significantly different characteristics. (Table 2.1)
compares the profile of the poor and the non-poor, as well as those in the bottom 40 and top 60
percent of the income distribution in 2014. Non-poor households tend to have higher levels of
human capital: heads of household had nine years of education on average among the non-poor,
compared with about five years among poor and extreme poor households. The poor and extreme
poor belonged to larger households compared to the non-poor. They were also more likely to live
in households with larger dependency ratios of younger children compared to the non-poor; the
proportion of individuals 12 years old or younger in poor households was twice as large as that
observed in non-poor households in 2014.
Income-generation capacity also varies. For example, the average per capita income of the nonpoor is 17 times higher than the income of the extreme poor and seven times higher than the income
of the overall poor. The poor are more likely to work in the agricultural sector and to be selfemployed, while the non-poor tend to work more in services and to be formally employed. The
poor are also more likely to live in female-headed households, but non-poor women are twice as
likely as poor women to participate in the labor force.
Indicators of “multidimensional poverty” improved between 2000 and 2011. Despite the
modest reduction in income (monetary) poverty reduction that the country experienced during the
first decade of the 2000s, the 2011 Census revealed a significant reduction in the percentage of
households considered poor from a multidimensional measure, related mostly to improved access
to basic infrastructure and services.13 Thus, the percentage of households in multidimensional
poverty—that is, who did not meet one or more of the four basic conditions—dropped from 36.1
13

The multidimensional poverty measure from INEC captures four basic conditions that are strongly related to
monetary poverty: housing, health, education, and access to other goods and services (purchasing power). Each
condition has one or more indicators. A household is considered poor if it cannot satisfy one or more condition.

11

percent in 2000 to 24.6 percent in 2011.14 The share of households who did not meet the
“education” component of the multi-dimensional indicator fell from 15.2 to 8.3 percent, as school
attendance of children ages 7–17 increased and repetition fell. At the same time, in 2011, 9.3
percent of households did not satisfy the “health” condition, while 7.8 percent did not satisfy the
“consumption” condition, and 6.2 percent did not satisfy the “housing” condition (still, all three
measures were lower than in 2000). Increased access to piped water and sewage, increased access
to electricity, and a lower dependency ratio contributed to reducing the share of households who
did not meet these conditions.

Box 2.2: Indigenous people in Costa Rica: a very small and disadvantaged minority
Costa Rica’s indigenous population is small, but occupies a vast share of the land. In the Latin American
region as a whole, indigenous people make up about seven percent of the total population (over 36.6 million
people). In comparison, in Costa Rica they represent 2.4 percent of the population (104,143 indigenous
people). As such, Costa Rica, along with El Salvador, is the country with the smallest proportion of indigenous
people in the entire region. In terms of land, legally established indigenous territories cover about seven
percent of the Costa Rican territory (about 350 thousand hectares), but 91 percent of the indigenous
population is concentrated in three cantons—Talamanca, Buenos Aires, and Hojancha (figure B2.2.1).
In the first decade of the 2000s, the indigenous population experienced a similar demographic
transition as the rest of the Costa Rican population, with a falling share of children and a growing
share of elderly adults. The dependency rate fell from 108 percent in 2000 to 79.8 percent in 2011, showing
the sharp decline in the share of children that resulted from a decline in fertility rates, from 9.6 to two
between 2000 and 2011, together with an increase in the share of elderly adults, from four percent to 8.8
percent. Even if indigenous households are still larger than non-indigenous (3.6 versus 3.4 people per
household) these differences have been falling over time.
Figure B2.2.1: Indigenous people are located mostly in the Southern region

Historically, indigenous populations have had lower access to basic services than the nonindigenous. Despite a broad coverage of basic services to most of the population of Costa Rica, indigenous
people still lag behind in access to electricity, water supply, and sewage. According to the 2011 Census, 80
percent of indigenous households had an electricity connection, against 99 percent of non-indigenous. Still,
compared to other indigenous populations in LAC, access to electricity is higher than in Colombia (58
percent), El Salvador (62 percent), Nicaragua (50 percent), or Panama (40 percent). As for access to clean
water, 31 percent of the indigenous population had no access to sewage (public or private), against four
percent of non-indigenous. And only 67 percent had access to piped water, against 94 percent of nonindigenous (figure B2.2.2). However, these indicators have improved significantly since 2000, as the 2000
Census reported that only 53 percent of households had access to clean water, 50 percent had access to some
form of sewage, and 67 percent had electricity. In addition the share of households living in overcrowded
conditions fell from 30 percent to 11 percent.

Human capital accumulation and income generating opportunities are also lower for indigenous
populations. Indigenous people report lower educational attainment than non-indigenous: average years
of education among the indigenous is 6.1, against 7.7 for non-indigenous (although this shows progress from
the 3.9 years on average in 2000). Illiteracy is at 7.7 among indigenous and 2.2 among non-indigenous, and
attendance to formal education among people 5–24 years old is 64.9 against 71.7 for non-indigenous. This
translates into lower employment and income opportunities among the indigenous, as they have a higher
probability of working in self-employment or unpaid work, and to be doing household chores rather than
studying, for those who do not have an income-generating activity (figure B2.2.3).

Nearly half of Costa Ricans are classified as “middle class.” The middle class, internationally
defined as the share of the population that lives on US$10 to US$50 per day, has expanded
significantly, from 32 percent of the population in 2001 to almost 47 percent by 2012, mirroring
trends in the LAC region (Figure 2.4a). As Figure 2.4b shows, Costa Rica’s middle class is among
the largest in LAC in percentage terms, surpassed only by Argentina (54 percent) and Uruguay (57
percent). Still, about one-third of the population (those with incomes between US$4 and US$10 a
day) remains vulnerable to falling back into poverty if hit by a shock.

Note: Poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than $4 a day (2005 US$ Purchasing Parity Power per day). Vulnerable
are those living with a per capita income between US$4 and US$10 a day. Middle class is defined as the proportion of
individuals with an income between US$10 and US$50 a day. Rich are those with an income higher than US$50 a day. Regional
estimates are population-weighted averages of country-specific estimates for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and
Uruguay. SEDLAC international comparable data is available only up to 2012. Numbers are not strictly comparable before and
after 2010 (see Box 2.1).

Upward mobility has contributed to the rise of the middle class. Trends in the share of poor
and the middle class conceal movements in and out of poverty. Between 2003 and 2009 (a period
for which comparable data exist for Costa Rica), increasing incomes resulted in important upward
mobility. About 17 percent of Costa Rica’s population (57 percent of the originally poor) escaped
poverty during those years (Figure 2.5).15 At the same time, however, about eight percent of the
total population fell into poverty, including 11 percent of those who were previously non-poor.
Downward mobility was higher in Costa Rica than in the LAC region, while upward mobility was
lower. About 23 percent of the total population of LAC (half of the originally poor) escaped
15

The analysis on the movement in and out of poverty relies on a synthetic panel estimated using the methodology of
Dang and Lanjouw (2014). The synthetic panel results for poverty do not completely align with the national or
international figures presented earlier, because the sample is restricted to households whose head is between 25 and
65 years of age.

Note: Poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than $4 a day. Estimates of poverty at the regional level are populationweighted averages of country-specific estimates for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Countryspecific figures in regional estimates come from 2004 or 2012 surveys, or the nearest year in cases in which 2004 and/or 2012
data are unavailable. Due to comparability issues, Costa Rica estimates come from 2003 and 2009 surveys. International
comparable SEDLAC data is available only up to 2012.

Costa Rica experienced many years of shared prosperity, with the incomes of the poorest 40
percent growing faster than the average. Income growth of the bottom 40 percent was six
percent between 2003 and 2007, higher than the mean income growth of 3.9 percent. Moreover,
the incomes of those in the bottom 40 percent also grew faster in Costa Rica as compared with
their counterparts in other countries in the LAC region (Figure 2.6a).
However, after the global financial crisis, shared prosperity declined and the incomes of the
poorest fell behind. Income growth for the bottom 40 percent fell to 1.6 percent over the period
from 2007 to 2012, significantly lower than average income growth in Costa Rica (3.4 percent)
and among the lowest in LAC (Figure 2.6b). This lower income growth for those in the bottom 40
percent of the population did not allow many individuals to escape poverty after 2010, and poverty
reduction stagnated.

Before the crisis, even the poorest regions benefitted from shared prosperity. Between 2003
and 2007 there was some income convergence across regions, with the incomes of the bottom 40
percent growing at more than 10 percent in Brunca and Chorotega (the poorest regions in the
country), against 3.4 percent in Central region (Figure 2.7a). Even in the Central region, incomes
at the bottom 40 and at the average grew at similar rates. However, after the global crisis (Figure
2.7b) incomes of the bottom 40 percent grew more slowly. In particular, in the Central and Norte
regions, average incomes grew faster than incomes at the bottom, reversing the pre-crisis trend in
shared prosperity.

Income inequality has risen or stagnated since the 1990s. Changes in household survey
methodologies create problems for the comparability of measure of inequality over time (box
2.1).16 Nonetheless, long-term trends over different periods indicate that inequality has either risen
or remained flat since the late 1980s. During the period from 1989 to 2000, the Gini measure of
inequality averaged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in 1989 to 0.48 by 2000. During the period from 2001
to 2009, the Gini fell and then rose again, averaging 0.50 across the period. Inequality has risen in
recent years, averaging 0.52 from 2010 to 2014, a time period that corresponds both to the postcrisis recovery and to the period covered by the new ENAHO household survey (Box 2.1).17
In contrast, the rest of Latin America witnessed a marked decline in inequality, with the
regional average falling by five points, from 0.57 in 2000 to 0.52 in 2012 (Figure 2.8a).18 As a
result, Costa Rica has gone from being the least unequal country in LAC after Uruguay in 2000,
to being around the median country by 2012.19 In non-LAC OECD countries, income inequality
has been consistently much lower, with a Gini coefficient 0.30 in 1995-2012. Rising inequality in

The long-term trends in poverty and inequality are subject to caveats regarding income measurement due to several
changes in survey methodology across that time period. The main “breaks” in comparability of the data series occur
in 2001 and 2010. As such, measurement of welfare across the three time periods of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–
14 is not strictly comparable. See box 2.1.
17
Inequality based on official per capita income presents a similar trend, decreasing from 0.52 to 0.48 in 2000–2005
and increasing to 0.51 in 2009. After the global crisis, inequality increased marginally from 0.51 to 0.52 in 2010–
2014. The ENIG (Encuesto Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos) finds that income inequality remained constant with a Gini
of 0.534 after adjusting for methodological differences in the definition of income (email exchanges with INEC’s staff
http://www.inec.go.cr/).

Costa Rica is underpinned by the widening gap between the earned incomes and skillset of rich
and poor workers in Costa Rica (see Chapter 3).
Similar to most countries in LAC, income is highly concentrated among the rich in Costa
Rica. About 22 percent of income is held by the rich in Costa Rica, a similar share to the average
in LAC (Figure 2.8b). The top 20 percent of the population earns 54 percent of the income, while
the share of income going to the middle class—spanning the 48th to 96th centiles of the population
in 2012—amounts to 61 percent. The average income of the rich was 10.3 times higher than that
of the poor in Costa Rica, slightly higher than the LAC ratio (9.5 times).

individuals with an income between US$10-US$50 a day. Rich are those with an income higher than US$50 a day. SEDLAC
international comparable data is only available up to 2012. Inequality numbers are not strictly comparable before and after 2001
and before and after 2010 (Box 2.1).

Within the country, inequality varies across regions. Brunca, Norte, and Chorotega are the
regions with the highest income inequality, while Pacifica and Atlantica are the least unequal
(Figure 2.9a). It is interesting to note that inequality fell since 2010 in all but the Central region,
where the capital city of San Jose is located. Thus, the Central region seems to have driven the
overall increment of the Gini by one point. The weight of the Central region in explaining the
overall Gini is confirmed by Figure 2.9b, which shows that inequality in the Central region
accounts for three-quarters of total inequality in Costa Rica.

During the 2000s, poverty was not very responsive to growth in Costa Rica. Indeed, the
elasticity of poverty to growth has been low: between 2001 and 2007, a one percent increase in
GDP per capita was associated with only a 0.60 percent reduction in the official poverty rate.20 In
comparison, the poverty-growth elasticity in LAC over the same period was much higher, reaching
1.43. After the global financial crisis, the growth-poverty elasticity decreased even further in Costa
Rica, to 0.44 over 2010–13, whereas in LAC it increased further to 2.0 in 2010–2012.21 This low
poverty-growth elasticity in Costa Rica was also observed for periods before 2000, particularly
during the 1990s.22
The global financial crisis marks a clear inflection point, after which the incomes in the
wealthiest deciles grew significantly faster and the poor fell behind. Growth incidence curves
(Figure 2.10) reveal that before 2007, growth was largely pro-poor. Indeed, the incomes of the
bottom deciles of the income distribution grew faster than those in the top deciles. During and after
the crisis, however, the incomes of those in the poorest deciles fell, further widening the gap
between the poor and the rest of the population.

Over time, rising inequality and price effects have offset the contribution of growth to
poverty reduction. Changes in income poverty stem from growth, inequality, and inflation.
Inflation could affect poverty through its effects on real wages, cost of goods and services, and the
regressive nature of the inflation tax. Costa Rica’s success in controlling inflation could suggest
progress in poverty reduction. A decomposition of changes in poverty suggests shifting effects of
these factors (Figure 2.11). During the pre-crisis period, poverty fell by 3.8 percentage points,
helped by strong growth and changes in inequality that positively affected the bottom end of the
income distribution. However, these gains were partially offset by rising prices. During the global
crisis, growth slowed, food prices rose, and inequality worsened—so that the net effect was an
increase in poverty of 2.6 percentage points during these years (2007–09). Finally, in the postcrisis recovery period, rising inequality more than offset the positive contribution of growth to
poverty reduction, such that poverty rose slightly during that period (2010–14). If income
inequality had not increased, growth alone would have decreased poverty by three percentage
points during the recovery of 2010–14.23 Instead, poverty rose by 0.4 percentage points during
that period.

23

The decomposition follows Kolenikov and Shorrocks (2005), who extended the standard Datt and Ravallion (1992)
decomposition to include price changes. The effect of inflation during 2007–2009 on the poverty rate is due mainly
to measurement issues (see box 2.1).

Costa Rica’s inequality trends over the last two decades present a dilemma. The widening income gap between
the top and bottom quintiles of the population reflects changes in the labor market and a mismatch between the
patterns of growth versus the skills profile of the workforce. With weak educational outcomes, the Costa Rican
labor force is not well adapted to a labor market that increasingly demands high skills, and unemployment has
increased among the poor and low-skilled workers, particularly since the global crisis. The earnings gaps
between rich and poor, and between the skilled and unskilled, have widened. Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s
ambitious Social Compact, taxes and transfers have not proven to be effective in redistributing income to
compensate for these disparities.

Rising inequality stands out as a pressing challenge for Costa Rica, particularly in light of its
enduring commitment to a far-reaching Social Compact. As discussed in Chapter 2, the gap
between the rich and poor has widened significantly since the global crisis. This follows two
decades of rising or stagnating inequality—in stark contrast to the significant decline in inequality
in the broader Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. These trends are particularly puzzling
given Costa Rica’s long-standing investment in an ambitious Social Compact and high social
spending, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Most inequality stems from differences in earned labor incomes. In general, inequality can
come from many sources: differences in labor earnings, pension income and other public sector
transfers, and in the returns to capital. Throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, changes in
poverty and inequality have been mainly driven by changes in labor incomes.24 And this has also
been the case for Costa Rica, where changes in labor incomes have been the driving force behind
reductions and increases in poverty and inequality over the past 15 years. Specifically, increases
in labor incomes contributed to a 4.2 percentage point reduction of poverty and a 1.0 point
reduction in the Gini coefficient during the pre-crisis period of 2000–07, but this trend was
reversed during the global crisis and changes in labor incomes resulted in a 2.2 percentage point
increase in poverty and a one percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient during the period
from 2007 to 2009 (Figure 3.1). Over the post-crisis recovery period, changes in labor incomes
have contributed to a slight increase in poverty and an additional one-point increase in the Gini
coefficient (2010–14).
Moreover, most inequality derives from differences in labor earnings in the private sector. A
decomposition of the Gini coefficient in 2001, 2007, and 2012 reveals that labor income explained
over 80 percent of overall income inequality (Table 3.1).25 However, while the labor income share
decreased over the 2000s to 72 percent, this decline was entirely explained by changes in labor
incomes in the private sector, while the share of inequality stemming from differences in incomes
from public sector jobs remained constant over that period. Although the contributions of nonlabor income remain relatively small, the share of inequality deriving from differences in returns
to capital and pension income doubled, from about nine percent to nearly 18 percent over the
period (Table 3.1). Public sector transfers (social assistance) reduced inequality only marginally
24

World Bank (2014e).
This follows Trejos and Oviedo (2012), who find that labor income for skilled workers, followed by income for
employers, capital returns, and contributory pension income explained 85 percent of inequality in 2009.
25

23

and only until 2007: they became regressive, contributing to increased inequality by 2012.26 This
confirms that larger increases in the top portions of the income distribution (and in the public sector
in particular) in the second half of the 2000s played an important role in the increase of inequality,
which social assistance programs were not able to counterbalance.

Poor and unskilled workers are finding limited job opportunities due to the long-term shift
in Costa Rica’s pattern of growth and the recent contraction following the global crisis. Costa
Rica’s outward-oriented economic development model has brought about a significant shift in the
demand for skilled and unskilled labor. As discussed in Chapter 4, it has favored the development
of high value-added sectors, such as electronics, medical devices, IT business services, and so
forth. In contrast, lower value-added sectors, such as construction, domestic services, and
agriculture have grown more slowly—or even contracted. The growth of low-end manufacturing

According to Trejos and Oviedo (2012), the share of the Gini explained by social assistance went from -0.3 in 2001
to -0.9 in 2009.

24

(such as textiles), construction, and agriculture has particularly slowed since the onset of the global
crisis. Job creation has been minimal or even negative in sectors like construction, domestic
services, and agriculture, which employ over 50 percent of low-skilled workers (Figure 3.2). At
the other end of the spectrum, sectors that employ mostly skilled workers, such as financial
services, real estate, personal services, and others, are growing fast (though from a low base in the
case of sectors such as utilities or financial services). Changing patterns in foreign direct
investment (FDI) and trade, along with Skill-Biased Technological Change, have increased local
demand for high-skilled labor at a time when Costa Rica has a larger relative supply of low-skilled
labor.27 High and increasing labor costs, relative to other Central American countries, could explain
the decrease in low-skilled job creation in lower value-added sectors, as discussed in Chapter 4.
This structural mismatch of skills and jobs has translated into rising unemployment and
falling demand for low-skilled labor, particularly since the crisis. Overall unemployment
climbed from 4.6 percent just before the crisis to 7.3 percent during the crisis. Even with economic
recovery post-crisis, unemployment has steadily risen to nine percent of the workforce in 2014
(Figure 3.3). These trends reflect a growing mismatch between the demand for labor and the skills
profile of the workforce.

As such, unemployment has hit the poor particularly hard. The unemployment rate for the
bottom quintile in Costa Rica exceeds 20 percent, far higher than for other income groups (Figure
3.4a). By comparison, unemployment in the top two quintiles is less than five percent. The
differential in the unemployment rate between the poor and non-poor is significant and increasing,
reaching more than 15 percent in 2013 (Figure 3.4b). In contrast, unemployment rates in the bottom
quintile among other Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama) are
significantly lower—hovering around five percent—likely reflecting higher rates of informality in
their labor markets. Interestingly, higher unemployment among the poor in Costa Rica is not
associated with an increase in the share of self-employed workers (a proxy for informal
employment).

Furthermore, over 60 percent of poor and extreme poor adults do not generate any labor
income. There is a stark contrast in terms of labor market activity between the poor and the nonpoor in Costa Rica. As Figure 3.5 illustrates, over 60 percent of the working-age adults who are
non-poor are employed, while about 30 percent are inactive and about four percent are
unemployed. In contrast, among the poor and the extreme poor, the opposite is true: 60 percent or
more of working-age adults in these groups are either inactive or unemployed. Put differently, less
than 40 percent of these adults generate any form of labor income. Moreover, this situation has
slightly worsened since 2007, when the share of inactive plus unemployed was below 60 percent
for the poor and slightly above for the extreme poor.

Moreover, the labor market presents a bleaker picture for women than for men. Female labor
force participation has been historically low in Costa Rica and is among the lowest in the LAC
region. By 2013, slightly over half (50.8 percent) of women of working age were active in the
labor market, and participation has fluctuated around 50 percent during the 2000s, increasing only
marginally. Moreover, unemployment rates have been consistently above the average, going from
6.9 percent in 2007 to 10.9 percent in 2013. As a result, the share of working-age women who are
26

actually generating labor income is below 40 percent. Poor women who are heads of household
and immigrant women have particularly high unemployment rates (Box 3.1).
Box 3.1: Female household heads and immigrants face a tough labor market
In the last two decades, the Costa Rican population has seen a significant change in the composition of
households, with an important increase in the share of households headed by women. Between 1990 and
2013, the share of households headed by women doubled from 18 percent to 36 percent. According to some
studies, this increase implied a higher female participation in the labor market, especially among women
who are low skilled and more likely to live in poverty. Indeed, the participation of female household heads
in the labor force is much higher than the average female participation, although it is especially high among
non-poor household heads (Figure B3.1.1a).
Poor women who are heads-of-household experience particularly high unemployment rates. Female headsof-household who are poor, and in particular single mothers, have an unemployment rate of over twice the
average for women (Figure B3.1.1b). Given that these women are more likely to have low skills, their
employment opportunities are fewer, and as a result they experience higher unemployment.

Immigrant women have even higher unemployment rates. Immigrants, particularly from Nicaragua,
represent a large share of the labor force in Costa Rica, in particular in low-skilled employment. As shown in
figure B3.1.2, women born in Nicaragua and other Central American countries have an unemployment rate
around twice the average for women, whereas for men the rate is below average.

Despite significant investment, the education system has not adapted to provide the skills
needed for the changing economy—or to ensure opportunities for the poor. Educational
outcomes are surprisingly weak, given the level of spending and development. Like many middleincome countries, Costa Rica is finding that achieving basic levels of education, such as near
universal literacy and completion of primary school, is not enough to generate the skills needed to
sustain the demands of its evolving economy—or to promote inclusive opportunities for the poor
and bottom 40 percent of the population. Given the country’s level of development and high
spending, its education system seriously underperforms in terms of retention (as evidenced by high
school dropout rates) and quality (as demonstrated by weak test results). Moreover, disparities in
education outcomes are large, putting the poor and bottom 40 percent at a significant disadvantage
for learning and earning.
Low educational attainment: overall and for the poor
Despite large public investment and important achievements, average school attainment is
still low in Costa Rica. The growing investment in education in the country has brought important
gains in terms of literacy and primary school completion. By 2011, the literacy rate for adults 15
years old and above had reached 97 percent, and the share of adults 25 years and above who had
no formal education went from 21 percent in 1950 to three percent in 2010. By 2010, 83 percent
of adults had achieved at least a complete primary education (Figure 3.6a). However, the average
level of education today is below what would be expected given Costa Rica’s GDP per capita and
education spending. Indeed, today, fewer than half of young adults 18–29 years old—and less than
40 percent of the overall workforce—have completed secondary education (Figure 3.6b).

Indeed, compared with other countries, dropout rates are quite high in Costa Rica. Less than
half of the cohort 25–29 years old had achieved a secondary or higher education by 2010, further
adding to the stock of low-skilled adult workers, a legacy of the 1980s crisis. Costa Rica’s
educational attainment is lower than in peer countries in LAC (such as Chile and Panama), and
significantly lower than in peer countries in Europe (such as Croatia and Lithuania), and far lower
28

than graduation rates in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
(Figure 3.7).

Inequities in educational attainment are closely related to poverty. Figure 3.8a shows gross
enrollment rates by quintile for primary and secondary. Enrollment in primary is higher at lower
levels of income, which is positive in the sense that enrollment is very high for all children, even
the poorest. However, Figure 3.8b shows that the share of children who are over-age (that is, who
are a year or more older than the correct age for their grade) is higher for children in poorer
quintiles. Taken together, these statistics suggest that even though enrollment is high among poor
children, repetition rates are also high, and therefore the quality of their learning might be lower
and their incentives to drop out after completing primary may be higher. Consistent with that story,
we observe that enrollment rates in secondary are significantly higher for children in richer
quintiles.

There are large disparities in enrollment in day care and preschool, but these even out by the
time children enter primary school. As the Figure 3.9a shows, by age four about 60 percent of
children from households with educated parents are attending a day-care center, as compared with
40 percent for children in households with medium education attainment, and about 20 percent for
children from households with low education.28 Attendance in preschool is also higher for children
from wealthier families: virtually all five to six year olds from the top quintile of the population
attend preschool, as compared with 79 percent of those in families in the poorest quintile.29
Enrollment equalizes by the time children start first grade, and it remains close to 100 percent for
all children throughout primary, reflecting Costa Rica’s long-standing guarantee of basic public
education.
The transition from primary to secondary school is particularly prone to high dropout rates,
especially among children from households with weaker parental education. At around age
12, some children begin to drop out, and those from households with a low “educational
environment” (that is, children whose parents have low education) have a much faster dropout rate
than children from more educated households (Figure 3.9b). In fact, a recent study of the factors
behind human capital accumulation finds that, although context variables, such as place of
residence, explained a significant share of the educational attainment inequality in the 1990s, at
present only household and individual level variables, such as parental education, explain such
outcomes.30 Income status also affects enrollment, with only 77 percent of teens aged 13 to 17
from households in the poorest quintile attending school as compared with 93 percent of those
from households in the richest quintile.31

28

Education attainment of the household is defined as the average education level of all adults 18 years and older in
the household. A “low” level corresponds to an average of less than primary; “medium” corresponds to complete
primary and incomplete secondary; and “high” corresponds to complete secondary and above. See Estado de la Nación
(2013).

Dropouts are highest in seventh grade, just after the completion of primary education. For
many children, this is linked to their poor performance during primary school (repetition and low
content learning), which affects their motivation to continue during secondary. However, some
children who drop out of the system also face barriers such as distance (lack of transportation),
costs (of school supplies and others), and household chores (for certain groups of girls).

Regional gaps in educational attainment also exist, but they are slowly decreasing. As Figure
3.10a shows, the median educational attainment of adults 15 years and older is up to twice as high
in the Central Region (dark green in the map) as in the peripheral districts around it (dark red
districts). A ranking of all districts in Costa Rica according to the share of adults 17–21 who have
completed secondary education shows that there is a 42-percentage point gap between the
completion rate for the bottom and the top 20 percent of districts in terms of completion (26.3
percent against 68.2 percent). A similar gap is seen in terms of net upper secondary enrollment
(Figure 3.10b) across districts, although the gap has been closing in recent years, as lowperforming districts have increased their enrollment rates faster than high-performing ones.32
Notice, however, that even in the best-performing districts net enrollment in upper secondary is
below 50 percent.

Knowledge Gap 3.1: Why are so many kids dropping out of school in Costa Rica?
The skilled-biased development that Costa Rica has experienced has raised returns to education, particularly secondary
and tertiary. Given a large secondary school network in the country and universal primary completion, it is therefore
surprising that more than half of the children who finish primary fail to complete secondary education. Although some
general factors are known (see Figure K3.1.1), such as lack of motivation, distance (in rural areas), and gender bias,
the specific factors that push children out of school are still unknown, as are the critical ages at which early signs of
dropout can be detected.

Poor quality of education
The quality of education in Costa Rica is also very low, given its level of spending. At the
primary school level, the latest results from the TERCE examination of Latin American students
by UNESCO show that Costa Rica is the only country in the sample where students in both third
and sixth grades performed worse in TERCE (2013) than they did in SERCE (2006) in reading
and in mathematics.33 Similarly, the performance of Costa Rican students at the secondary school
level is also weak. Specifically, the performance of 15-year-old students on the international PISA
mathematics exam is far lower than would be predicted by Costa Rica’s spending on secondary
education (Figure 3.11).34 Moreover, since these tests are taken only by those who remain in school
by age 15, and since dropout rates are so high in Costa Rica, the average skill levels and learning
outcomes of all 15 year olds (including those in and outside school) are likely even lower.

Moreover, there are large disparities in learning outcomes by socioeconomic status.
UNESCO’s SERCE study also shows that children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds
obtain better scores than their peers from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (Figure 3.12 ).35

Bilagher (2014). TERCE (the Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study) is a large-scale study that
assesses the performance of pupils in third and sixth grades of primary school in mathematics, reading, and writing
(language), plus natural sciences in the case of sixth grade. Fifteen LAC countries took part in 2013, plus the Mexican
state of Nuevo León (Mexico). SERCE is the second study with the same characteristics that took place in 2006. See

Wages are relatively high across the board—even in low value-added sectors. As discussed in
Chapter 4, Costa Rica has relatively high wages compared to Central American neighbors, in both
agriculture and low-tech industry (light manufacturing)—two sectors that traditionally employ
low-skilled workers. Surprisingly, neither rising rates of unemployment nor the continuous influx
of low-skilled migrant workers from Nicaragua (Box 3.2) have put downward pressure on lowskilled wages. Moreover, the minimum wage does not appear to be driving artificially high lowskilled wages. Minimum wages are binding for most Costa Rican workers in formal salaried jobs,
especially in low-skilled jobs.36 And while changes in minimum wages over the 1980s–1990s did
result in a small reduction in employment, this effect was minor, and there were no effects on
wages or employment in the uncovered sectors (self-employment). More recently, changes in the
minimum wage have been very modest, mostly correcting for inflation, and the evolution of the
real minimum wage has closely tracked the evolution of labor productivity (Figure 3.13: ).
Moreover, a study of the increase in the enforcement of minimum wage policy shows that it had a
small positive effect on wages, especially where the minimum wage is most binding (at lower
levels), but it did not affect employment in any segment of the distribution.37 Rather, it appears
that high income levels, coupled with generous social benefits, have resulted in high reservation
wages across the board in Costa Rica.

36

Salaried employment (which is mostly formal in Costa Rica) represented 62.4 percent of employment among
workers living in poverty, and 78.7 percent among non-poor workers in 2013, whereas 33 percent of poor workers
were self-employed, against 16 percent of non-poor. Hence, the minimum wage policy applies to the large majority
of workers. In the late 1990s, almost three-quarters of all workers’ earnings were concentrated around the five main
minimum wage categories (out of the total 19 different wages). See Gindling and Terrell (2004).
37
See Gindling, Mossaad, and Trejos (2013).

34

Knowledge Gap 3.2: Are reservation wages high in Costa Rica?
The increase in unemployment rates, especially among poor workers, and the marginal changes in self-employment,
a proxy for informal employment, is a puzzling finding. Most LAC countries respond to a decrease of jobs in the
formal sector with a surge in informal employment, in the absence of a safety net that enables workers to look for
other formal jobs. In Costa Rica, however, this did not happen, even if there is no clear evidence that the social safety
net provides sufficient income support to those who are unemployed. Thus, the question arises of how high reservation
wages are in Costa Rica, in a context of high average wages and a high cost of living relative to other countries in the
region.38

Box 3.2: Nicaraguan workers in Costa Rica do not appear to drive down native workers' wages
Immigrants, particularly from Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in Costa Rica, in particular
in low-skilled employment. In 2013, over 10 percent of those employed in Costa Rica were foreign-born, of
which eight percent were Nicaraguan. Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica are largely unskilled: less than
20 percent completed secondary school while over a third (35 percent) did not complete primary school. 1
However, Costa Ricans also have low schooling on average—in fact, 46 percent of both Nicaraguan and
native-born adults finished primary school but did not complete secondary. This significant overlap in
educational attainment suggests the potential for competition between these two groups for low- or
unskilled jobs. This can be particularly true in specific sectors and specific parts of the country due to the
non-random dispersion patterns of immigrants. Four sectors of employment—agriculture, domestic service,
commerce and hotels/restaurants, and construction—account for 75 percent of low-skilled immigrant
employment in 2013. For context, these same four sectors accounted for only 59 percent of low-skilled
native-born employment. In some parts of the country, foreign-born workers account for significant shares
of workers in these four sectors, including over 20 percent of all workers in domestic services and
construction in Huetar Norte and the Central regions.
The presence of immigrant workers has little bearing on the wages of low-skilled Costa Rican workers—and
is actually correlated with higher wages among higher-skilled Costa Ricans. Exploiting the sectoral and
geographical differences in immigrant employment in Costa Rica, log wage regressions reveal positive
correlations between native wages and the proportion of foreign-born workers in the same employment
category as natives, where the employment category is defined at the region and sector level. This suggests
positive complementarities between immigrant labor and skilled native labor. This is a sizeable relationship,
with native workers who completed secondary receiving a wage premium of 22 percent at the average share
of immigrants for this group (8.3 percent).2 At the same time, no statistically significant relationship is
evident between unskilled native workers and immigrants—suggesting that wages of native workers are not
being lowered by immigrant labor. Similar analysis found no evidence of increased unemployment among
native labor in regions with more immigrants.

migrate to higher-paying regions and/or work in higher-wage sectors resulting in a higher share of immigrant workers in these
higher-paying sectors. The skill and sector distributions shown in figure 1 suggest that this is not the driving force.

Despite relatively high wages even for low-skilled workers, the earnings gap between rich
and poor workers is widening. Even though earnings have grown in real terms for low-skilled
workers, they have fallen in relative terms to high-skilled workers. As Figure 3.14 shows, relative
to the median earnings level, between 2007 and 2013 workers in the top quintile increased the ratio
of their earnings to the median earner by 0.19 (from 2 to 2.19). At the same time, workers in the
bottom quintile decreased the ratio of earnings to the median by 0.23 (from 0.52 to 0.29), while
workers in the second to fourth quintile kept the ratios to the median almost flat. A similar picture
is seen when income groups are divided according to workers’ education. For workers with tertiary
education, the ratio to the median income increased from 1.89 to 2.01 between 2007 and 2013, for
workers with secondary complete and secondary incomplete it remained flat, and for workers with
primary or less the ratio fell from 0.79 to 0.73 of the median income. This resulted in a widening
of the gap between the highest-paid and the lowest-paid workers, which is at the root of the increase
in inequality that occurred in the second half of the 2000s.

Indeed, the incomes of the poorest and those with the lowest skills grew faster before the
crisis—and fell the most since the crisis. Figure 3.15 plots the evolution of incomes for
individuals in the poorest income decile (Figure 3.15a) and the richest decile (Figure 3.15b),
36

divided according to the educational attainment (skills level) of the household head. Figure 3.15a
shows clearly that before 2007, the incomes of individuals in the poorest decile, whose head of
household had fewer than eight years of education, grew faster than the incomes of those
individuals (also in the poorest decile) whose household head had more education. Moreover the
incomes in the poorest decile also grew much faster than the incomes of individuals in the richest
decile, which actually fell between 2001 and 2007. In contrast, starting in 2008 low incomes begin
to decline, and high incomes begin to rise, which becomes more apparent after 2010.39
Interestingly, educational gaps appear to matter more at the bottom of the distribution before 2007,
suggesting that income increases were the highest among the lowest-skilled and poorest workers
in the pre-crisis period.

Finally, redistributive policies have not been effective in compensating for inequities
associated with labor earnings and skills. Redistribution policies have had a modest effect on
overall inequality. The challenges facing Costa Rica and other LAC countries for reducing poverty
in the future highlight the importance of ensuring that fiscal policy has a strong equity focus and
redistributes the gains from growth among those who are less well off.40 The Commitment to
Equity Project (CEQ), a joint initiative of Tulane University and the Inter-American Dialogue, has
developed a harmonized methodology to assess the distributional impact of taxation and public
expenditure throughout Latin America.41 Figure 3.16a shows the gradual impact of fiscal policy in
six LAC countries including Costa Rica. Fiscal policy is decomposed into direct taxes (such as
income and payroll taxes); direct transfers (such as non-contributory pensions, and conditional and

World Bank (2014e).
41
Important caveats and assumptions need to be considered when analyzing results from the CEQ project. The
approach is static and does not take behavioral responses into account. On the expenditure side the method focuses
only on transfers and expenditures in health and education and does not take into account other infrastructure spending,
or the quality of the services delivered. Finally, the approach does not consider the externalities of public expenditures
(World Bank 2014e).

unconditional cash transfers); and indirect taxes and transfers (such as value added taxes, and fuel
subsidies).42 In Costa Rica, direct and indirect transfers and taxes decrease income inequality by
three Gini points, from 0.51 to 0.49, a reduction comparable to Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay, and
larger than the reduction in Bolivia and Peru. The evidence available for these six countries
suggests that fiscal policy in LAC is not able to counterbalance the inequality pressures from labor
income.
On the other hand, the experience from OECD countries shows that redistributive policy has
the potential to reduce inequality. As Figure 3.16b shows, non-LAC OECD and select LAC
countries, including Costa Rica, have similar levels of market income inequality before any fiscal
intervention. The Gini coefficient hovers around 0.4 and 0.5 for all these countries. However, there
are significant differences in the impact of transfers (direct taxes on income, payroll taxes, and
direct transfers) between the LAC group and the OECD. The Gini that results after taking into
account direct taxes and transfers in the OECD group is somewhere around 0.3, while it remains
almost unchanged at around 0.5 in Costa Rica and the rest of the LAC group. According to World
Bank (2014e), the low tax revenue and high reliance on indirect taxation in LAC are important
reasons for these differences. This is also the case of Costa Rica. If compared with non-LAC
OECD countries, fiscal revenues are low and rely heavily on indirect taxes, which are neutral in
relative terms and therefore tend to reduce the progressivity of the overall tax system.43

for different income definitions. Market Income is the income received before any fiscal intervention. Net Market Income
subtracts direct income and payroll taxes to Market Income. Disposable Income is Net Market Income plus direct transfers.
Post-Fiscal Income adds indirect subsidies and subtracts taxes from disposable income. Final Income is Post-Fiscal Income plus
in-kind public transfers on health and education (World Bank 2014e).

Costa Rica’s small and open economy has achieved solid growth with an outward-oriented model combined
with macroeconomic and political stability. This model has encouraged export diversification towards higher
value-added sectors and increasing labor productivity. However, the economy is showing signs of built-up
vulnerabilities, resulting in weak job creation and loss of competitiveness. How can Costa Rica achieve higher
levels of growth? Evidence points to three priority areas: education & skills, infrastructure, and government
effectiveness and regulatory quality.

Costa Rica experienced solid economic growth in the past 25 years, as compared to Latin
America and the Caribbean but not with other countries. Its real growth averaged 4.7 percent
since 1990, above the Latin America average of 3.1 percent (Figure 4.1). During 2003–2007, Costa
Rica’s GDP growth was particularly strong at 6.7 percent on average, well above the regional
average for Latin America of 4.6 percent. During the crisis, growth slowed to 1.2 percent in 2008
and contracted by one percent in 2009. Following the global crisis, Costa Rica recovered similarly
to a set of peer comparator countries (Chile, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama, and
Uruguay) (Figure 4.2). However, this recovery has been slower than that of upper-middle-income
countries or comparator countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Growth decelerated
in 2013 to 3.5 percent and remained stable in 2014. The outlook is that growth will not accelerate
in 2015, amid deteriorating fiscal balances and a rising public debt-GDP ratio, but it is expected to
pick up afterwards. The recent closure of Intel’s microchip factory is expected to dampen growth
by about one-half to three-quarters percentage points in 2014–15.44

When examining growth by factor of production, the contribution of capital has been
relatively stable in the past two decades. However, the mid-2000s saw a sharp decline in the
contribution of Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Between 1999 and 2004, TFP declined strongly
and even turned negative, dragging overall growth by about 1.8 percentage points a year (down
from the positive contribution to growth of about 0.9 percentage points a year over the 1995–1999
period). TFP recovered over the 2004–2009 period, but employment growth declines resulted in a
sizeable reduction in labor’s contribution to output growth (from about 3.2 percentage points a
year to 1.9 percentage points (Figure 4.5). Although growth accounting is a descriptive
methodology and, by definition, does not provide specific insights into the factors that underlie
TFP growth, economists have consistently relied on measures of the growth “residual” TFP as a
gauge of a country’s technological change and innovation. In this light, TFP growth reflects a
reallocation of inputs to the sector of the economy with higher productivity gains. Moreover, this
is consistent with observed increases in labor productivity, measured as output per worker (Figure
3.13 in Chapter 3 and Figure 4.6).

Weakened investment and net exports have dragged growth in recent years. In the mid-2000s,
the external sector had a positive contribution to growth from an aggregate demand perspective,
as exports outweighed imports (Figure 4.7). With the global crisis, however, exports declined
sharply without an accompanying strong decline in imports. Softer economic growth in the United
States (Costa Rica’s main trading partner) as well as in China have weakened demand, and the
recent closure of Intel’s microchip factory in 2014 has further reduced exports. Intel’s electronics
exports alone accounted for 20 percent of merchandise exports.45 The lost dynamism in exports
has been exacerbated by rising imports outside free trade zones (FTZs). The contribution of
investment has also declined, lowering overall GDP growth.

The service sector continues to sustain growth. It has accounted for more than 60 percent of
GDP growth (about 2.7 percentage points of growth per year) before and after the global crisis
(Figure 4.8). Economic growth has been particularly strong in the telecommunications and tourism
sectors. The telecom liberalization has brought a renewed dynamism to the economy due to new
investments and expansion in the provision of services.46 The tourism sector also showed healthy
growth of eight percent a year in both 2013 and 2014, though its contribution to overall GDP
remains small (accounting for about 4.6 percent of GDP).
However, manufacturing, agriculture, and construction have reduced their contribution to
GDP growth. The manufacturing sector has experienced a loss of competitiveness due to exchange
rate appreciation, growing wages for low-skilled workers, and rising electricity prices. The
construction sector, which experienced a boom in the 2000s, has not returned to pre-crisis levels.
The data on new construction permits (excluding infrastructure and all public construction) shows
that during the boom years the construction sector doubled the number of permits from 2.2 to 4
million of square meters per year; but, after adjusting abruptly in 2009, the number of new permits
has contracted in the last two years. Amounting to about five percent of GDP, the construction
sector is relatively underdeveloped in Costa Rica when compared to Panama (10 percent) or
Uruguay (eight percent)). This underdevelopment is partly attributed to weakened public
infrastructure spending, which has been constrained by the limited fiscal space and anemic
implementation of projects, and lower credit growth. Agriculture output also stagnated due to
weather factors and the spread of the Roya fungus (“coffee rust”).47 As a share of GDP, agriculture
accounts for five percent of GDP, though it generates 12 percent of jobs. Agriculture is an
important source of jobs for the bottom 40 percent of the population (18 percent) and the extreme
poor (22 percent). Agricultural products, mainly coffee, pineapples, and bananas, account for 25
percent of exports.
Knowledge gap 4.1: Is the contraction of employment in the agriculture, manufacturing, and
construction sectors Cyclical or Structural?
Costa Rica has seen a significant contraction in employment in the construction, manufacturing, and
agricultural sectors. Cyclical patterns could be the culprits as the pattern emerged during the global crisis
for all three sectors, compounded by the Roya coffee rust fungus and weather factors in agriculture.
However, the contraction in jobs has persisted, which is particularly worrisome given that these sectors
employ a higher share of the poor and lower-skilled workers—and given the sustained rise in
unemployment. What are the structural factors in these sectors that are causing this sustained contraction?

The slowdown in economic activity after the global crisis has translated into weaker job
creation. As discussed in Chapter 3, the unemployment rate stood at nine percent in 2014, which
was relatively high by Costa Rican historical standards (Figure 3.3). In the past three years, the
economy has been adding around 10,000 jobs per year, which is lower than the usual average
annual increase in the labor force of about 38,000. The underperformance of the construction and
agriculture sectors is particularly worrisome considering that they employ a higher share of lowskilled workers (Figure 4.9). Another explanation for weaker job creation is that new firms, which
46

The telecommunication sector attracted large FDI flows, produced a significant consumer surplus advantage from
the reduction in prices and increase in Internet and cellular line access, increasing its contribution to GDP (World
Bank, 2013a). New private telecommunication companies and ICE contributed more to the value added in
telecommunications, as they provided more services and added new clients, generating new revenues.

The Roya fungus affected 60 percent of coffee planted area, resulting in output reduction of about 19 percent in
2013 (BCCR 2014).

Macroeconomic stability
One of the reasons behind growth performance is that the country has made efforts to
maintain reasonable macroeconomic stability. Costa Rica learned the importance of
macroeconomic stability the hard way: during the Latin American crisis of the early 1980s it
suffered a cumulative per-capita income loss of nearly 20 percent. Following that crisis, a new
government started a series of structural reforms and committed to pursuing macroeconomic
stabilization.48 Those policies proved successful in achieving a high and sustainable rate of growth
averaging nearly five percent per annum in 1983–2006. The fiscal deficit was virtually eliminated
at the end of that period, and public debt was reduced by two thirds, of which less than 20 percent
was from external sources. The decline of the debt burden was due in part to the Ministry of
Finance initiatives relating to the creation of a consolidated cash management office and the
implementation of a debt management strategy. Monetary and exchange rate policies have evolved
from a crawling peg policy to exchange rate band (2006) to abandonment of the pre-defined bands
(2015). Inflation has dropped to single digits since 2009. Until the global crisis, Costa Rica’s GDP
had not contracted in 25 years.

48

World Bank. (2006a). Apart from reducing industrial policy regulation and initiating a gradual opening of the
economy, it brought the fiscal situation under control by both increasing taxes and curtailing expenditures. On the
revenue side, the value added tax rate was increased and the tax base broadened. On the expenditure side, most
agricultural subsidies were eliminated, public sector salaries were frozen, and the public pension system was reformed.
The colon became fully convertible, and a crawling peg policy was implemented to stabilize the real exchange rate
and maintain external competitiveness.

44

Trade liberalization, FDI, and structural transformation
Moreover, outward-oriented policies have played a key role in fostering trade. Trade
liberalization has been nurtured through various actions and dates back to 1963, when Costa Rica
joined the Central American Common Market (CACM, made up of El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, and Nicaragua). Joining the CACM required the elimination of trade barriers among
member countries and fueled an increase of manufacturing exports to the CACM. A second
milestone took place 20 years later (1983), when Costa Rica joined the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
strengthening its trade relations with the United States.49 Like other Central American countries,
Costa Rica began to reduce tariffs unilaterally in the mid-1980s, with trade tariffs declining from
53 percent in 1985 to about 5.2 percent in 2004 and falling further since then. But perhaps the most
significant step was joining CAFTA-DR, after an intense national debate that required a
referendum for its ratification. 50 CAFTA-DR provided a more stable and reliable framework for
Costa Rica’s trade with its main trading partner, the United States, introduced changes to the legal
framework to promote transparency, ensured a secure and predictable environment for investors,
and led to the breakdown of government monopolies in the telecom and insurance sectors. 51
Following CAFTA-DR, Costa Rica has entered into further trade agreements with Canada, China,
the European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, consolidating its open-economy agenda.
Exports now represent around 55 percent of GDP, compared to around 27 percent in 1980. The
openness of the economy (measured by the ratio of exports plus imports to GDP) increased to 100
percent of GDP from 65 percent during the same period.
An explicit policy to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) complemented trade
liberalization efforts. Trade agreements, through provisions governing investment, reduce the
risk of expropriation and ensure against the discrimination of foreign firms. The passage of the
Free Trade Zones law in 1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010), which was adopted to promote the
export of non-traditional products, has contributed to attract FDI into Costa Rica.52 Free Trade
Zones accounted for 51 percent of merchandise exports in 2014, compared to 21 percent in 1997.
Whereas Costa Rica’s investment attraction efforts in the 1980s focused on lower value-added
sectors such as textiles, since the mid-1990s it has shifted to attracting FDI with high value-added
sectors, especially electronics and advanced manufacturing, medical devices and life sciences, and
ICT-related services. The country received US$407 million (three percent of GDP) in FDI inflows
in 1997, and this grew to US$2.7 billion by 2013 (5.4 percent of GDP). FDI decreased by about
1.2 percentage point of GDP, reaching 4.2 percent of GDP in 2014, partly affected by the exit of
Intel and Bank of America (Figure 4.11a). Nevertheless, Costa Rica is one of the world’s most
FDI-intensive economies, with its FDI-to-GDP ratio exceeding international levels from 1985
through 2010.53 The composition of FDI has shifted towards services, which accounted for 8.3
percent of total FDI inflows in 2002–05, but increased to 28 percent in 2010–14, partly attributed
to the liberalization of the telecom and insurance sectors (Figure 4.11b). In 2014, Costa Rica
attracted US$474.4 million of new investments across 39 projects that created 10,281 jobs,
offsetting the 4,343 jobs lost due to the exit or downsizing of some foreign firms.54

A successful institutional cluster has been effective in supporting trade and FDI. In the context
of Productive Development Policies (PDPs) that Costa Rica has put in place since the 1970s, one
success story is the PDP to attract FDI and promote exports. In this task there are three main actors:
the Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE), PROCOMER (Promotora del Comercio
Exterior de Costa Rica), and the Ministerio de Comercio Exterior (COMEX). All three work in
tandem to bring foreign direct investment to Costa Rica and promote exports. Collaboration
between CINDE and high levels of government, including the president, successfully brought Intel
to Costa Rica in 1996 (Box 4.1). By streamlining processes and facilitating the removal of
bottlenecks for multinational companies in the FTZs, these agencies were able to contribute to the
development of high-tech manufacturing and the country’s status as an attractive FDI location.
Trade liberalization and FDI have made Costa Rica stand out for its vibrant high-tech and
ICT sectors. Agricultural production now accounts for a little over five percent of GDP, compared
to 13 percent in the early 1980s. Moreover, the service sector’s share of GDP has increased,
becoming the main sector of the economy. The share of the manufacturing sector in GDP has
stagnated at about 22 percent in the past 25 years. At the same time, the employment share of
manufacturing decreased from 25 percent to 12 percent.55 As a result of attracting FDI in hightechnology sectors, Costa Rica’s share of high-tech manufacturing and ICT exports is among the
highest among upper-middle-income countries and Latin America (Figure 4.12). These trends
suggest a fast transformation of the economy into sectors in which Costa Rica had a competitive
advantage.

The economy contributes to a number of global value chains and has been able to upgrade
its product mix over time. Some examples are electronics, medical devices, automotive,
aeronautic/aerospace, film/broadcasting devices, and offshore services.56 During the 1990s the
profile of new companies shifted from a focus on electrical assembly to electronics. The product
mix for medical devices is complex and sophisticated, including products in the areas of optics,
dental, cardiovascular, and breast implants. Over time, many firms operating in the medical device
cluster have vertically integrated, received raw materials, and performed different activities in the
value chain (sustaining engineering, process development) (Figure 4.13). In the case of
aeronautics, firms are focusing on higher-value service activities—such as software and design
and engineering—and their product mix has upgraded as well.57

Box 4.1: Intel and development of the high-tech sector in Costa Rica
In 1996, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, announced plans for the establishment of its US$300
million semiconductor assembly and test (A&T) plant in Costa Rica. The country’s economic and political
stability, its proximity to the United States, and its pro-business environment were all important. Some
bottlenecks in Costa Rica’s investment climate raised some concerns, however, such as inadequate supply of
skilled labor, infrastructure and logistics (airport upgrades), tax incentives, and improvements in permits
and construction processes.58 The country’s tertiary educational system was strengthened with the
introduction of a series of programs to increase both the number of graduates with engineering and technical
degrees and the proficiency of the graduates.59 The stock of graduates from engineering programs in Costa
Rica reportedly increased by almost 40 percent between 2002 and 2011.60 CINDE also worked with existing
investors to “back link” potential suppliers—both local, through the Costa Rica PROVEE program, and
foreign—of products and services that transcended sectors, identifying commonalities between medical
devices and electronics in their procurement of clean room services, plastics, and metal mechanics61.
Intel contributed to the development of the high-tech sector through three channels: (i) it had a direct impact
on employment, investment, trade, output, and the development of the technology cluster; (ii) it served as a
catalyst for repositioning Costa Rica as an attractive investment location, through its impact on the country’s
technical education, incentives laws and regulations, and infrastructure;62 and (iii) it increased the
confidence of foreign investors through the demonstration effect. Intel’s decision to invest in Costa Rica gave
a “signaling effect” that helped solidify the country’s emergence as an attractive destination for FDI in hightech manufacturing. Companies that followed Intel in establishing manufacturing and global service
operations in Costa Rica included Abbott Laboratories (now Hospira), Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Hewlett
Packard.
In April 2014, Intel announced its decision to close its Costa Rican microchip assembly factory and move its
assembly operations to China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. While all microchip assembly operations will move to
Asia, Intel will keep its engineering and design departments and its global service center in Costa Rica, a
move that showcases Costa Rica’s competitiveness in high value-added segments. It is unclear what the
repercussions will be of Intel’s decision to leave because Costa Rica’s high-tech exports have become
increasingly diversified. As it has in the past, Costa Rica will need to strategically position itself and capitalize
on its strengths to continue to attract FDI and increase job creation.

Not only have exports tilted towards higher value-added sectors but they have also become
more diversified, minimizing exposure to weather or other shocks. With its integration into the
global value chain of medical devices, the country has been able to survive the phasing out of
Intel’s manufacturing plant. Exports of medical devices have grown at an average annual rate of
12 percent in the last decade (from US$0.55 billion in 2004 to US$1.9 billion in 2014), while
electronics grew at four percent per year on average. The product mix in the medical device cluster
is complex and sophisticated, including products in the areas of optics, dental, cardiovascular, and
breast implants. With its increasingly diversified agricultural portfolio (bananas, pineapples,
coffee, and agroindustry), agricultural exports have been shielded from wide swings due to weather
and diseases (Figure 4.14a). Business services (mainly ICT related) account for almost half of all
service exports. Leading activities in this sector also include design and engineering, professional
services, shared service centers (for example, back-office services for one company, including

However, backward linkages from multinational corporations (MNCs) to local companies
remain weak. On average, local suppliers provide only 24 percent of inputs to MNCs in Costa
Rica.63 Other studies cite that this percentage is even lower, at one percent of MNCs’ inputs. Less
than 20 percent of inputs sourced locally were incorporated in MNCs’ exports, indicating that the
inputs are likely of low value and not central to the value chain.64 Locally sourced products are
largely low valued-added products and services such as packaging, printing materials, and services
(for instance, cleaning and security).65 However, there is tangible demand for increased local
sourcing by MNCs. Of the MNCs interviewed by the World Bank in 2014, 93 percent declared an
interest in local procurement, and 40 percent claimed to have a supplier development program
already in place. Local firms face difficulties in complying with MNCs’ requirements, such as
quality standards, delivery times, or upgrading of technical capabilities. Moreover, local small and
medium enterprises may be deterred from seeking business with MNCs due to the uncertainty
around the process of upgrading their operations.66 The government’s programs to support
Based on a survey conducted by the World Bank in 2014, “Facilitating Global Value Chain Integration for
Competitiveness in Costa Rica” (World Bank 2014f). Other studies observing that backward linkages have been weak

backward linkages have had some tangible results, although these are quite small. The programs
have insufficient scale and scope to significantly influence the development of productive linkages
between domestic SMEs and MNCs.67
Although backward linkages may be small, the presence of MNCs has had positive spillovers
through knowledge transfers. One venue for these knowledge spillovers is through labor
movement from MNCs to local companies. A recent study for Costa Rica finds a positive spillover
generated by the movement of workers from MNCs to local firms. Former workers of MNCs create
new firms with lower mortality rates or boost firm performance for their new local employer.68 By
inducing skill upgrades and changes in education programs, the presence of MNCs have also
benefit local firms (Box 4.1).
Capitalizing on protected areas
Costa Rica has successfully capitalized on its environmental policies and Green Trademark,
by embracing and developing a sustainable tourism industry. 69 In 2013, close to 2.5 million
tourists visited the country. This implies that the number of visitors per capita (at around 0.5) is
above popular destinations in the Caribbean basin such as Mexico (0.2) or the Dominican Republic
(0.38). While sun-and-beach tourism clearly is part of Costa Rica’s attractions, eco-tourism (an
area where it has been a pioneer) is also very popular, with many travelers visiting the national
parks and protected areas. Moreover, the country ranked sixth in the region and 47th overall
according to the 2013 Travel and Tourism Competitive Index compiled annually by the World
Economic Forum to measure the factors that make a destination attractive for the travel and tourism
industry. Costa Rica’s large and mature ecotourism industry has earned it a reputation as a top
ecotourism destination in the world. The tourism industry is one of Costa Rica’s main sources of
foreign exchange (14.2 percent of total exports in 2013); its direct share in GDP was 4.6 percent
in 2013 (the indirect share was 12.1 percent), and it contributed directly 4.6 percent of total
employment (indirectly, it contributed 11.5 percent).70 The tourism sector comprises a diverse set
of operators (hotels, airlines, transportation companies, restaurants, etc.) that work together. Costa
Rica’s main attributes for tourists are its beautiful national parks, pleasant climate, and social and
economic achievements.71 Although its infrastructure has deficiencies, it has been able to sustain
the accelerated growth of the industry since the 1980s. Currently, a sector-wide traveler tax is used
for international promotion of the Costa Rican “brand,” which prevents free riding and ensures
that marketing for the country is well funded.
The tourism sector is well organized, with a strong public-private collaboration where
incentives are aligned. The sector is organized around two umbrella organizations: the Costa
Rican Chamber of Hotels (CCH), a very influential organization regrouping the largest hotel chains
(and several smaller hotels), and the National Chamber of Tourism (CANATUR), where tourismrelated businesses are represented (travel agencies, hotels, restaurants, etc.). The Costa Rican
Institute for Tourism (CR-ICT) is the autonomous public institution in charge of setting tourism

policy. The board of directors of the CR-ICT has a good balance of political appointees and
representatives of the industry, and the CEO of CR-ICT often comes from the tourism private
sector. Over time CR-ICT has adopted the role of promoter of private sector development,
coordinator of sectoral dialogue, and administrator of tourism development incentives. 72 Key
elements in the successful relationship between these three bodies are their strong
complementarity, the consultative approach to developing policy (there is a continuous dialogue
between the private and public sector), and the alignment of incentives (to maintain the Green
Trademark).

Increasing production costs weaken Costa Rica’s competitiveness. For many years, the
attraction of strategic foreign investment relied on the country’s unique combination of location
close to large markets, educated labor force, and political stability.73 According to the latest Global
Competitiveness report, the country scored well for health and primary education, higher education
and training, technology readiness, and innovation potential, and this contributed to Costa Rica’s
being ranked as the third most competitive economy in Latin America, behind Panama and Chile.
However, other countries in the region and beyond have caught up in terms of stability and
education of their labor force. In contrast, Costa Rica’s education system has not adapted to provide
the skills needed for the changing economy. Private firms perceived that rising costs are affecting
their operations (41 percent), with ones in the agricultural (62 percent) and manufacturing (50
percent) being the most affected.74 The cited factors for rising production costs are electricity (24
percent), fuel prices (17 percent), and salaries (13 percent).
Competitiveness pressures are not new: private firms have reported these investment climate
obstacles for many years. The World Economic Forum, which carries out yearly surveys to
construct its index of global competitiveness, has asked business executives to identify the most
problematic factors for doing business. For Costa Rica in 2014, the top five areas were inefficient
government bureaucracy (27 percent), inadequate supply of infrastructure (24 percent), access to
financing (11 percent), corruption (eight percent), and restrictive labor regulations (eight percent).
These areas are very similar to the ones identified seven years ago.75 The World Bank Enterprise
Surveys (WBES) also provides data on the perception of the private sector on growth. In 2010, the
latest survey, the top five problem areas were access to finance (26 percent), practices of informal
sector (23 percent), inadequately educated workforce (13 percent), business licenses and permits
(nine percent), and labor regulations (five percent).
These investment climate constraints do have a harmful effect on firms’ productivity. Using
objective indicators of investment climate constraints, Fajnzylber et al. (2009) find that
improvements in regulatory compliance would have the most beneficial impact on the productivity

of Costa Rican firms.76 With an expected contribution ranging from 61 to 72 percent depending
on the benchmark selected, the regulatory compliance captures the effect of regulation and
institutional quality and is proxied by sales declared for tax purposes and external audits.
Governance indicators, proxied by bribes, crime losses, and security costs, rank second,
contributing between 19 to 22 percent of the productivity increase. Infrastructure quality, which is
proxied in this analysis by firms’ losses caused by electricity outages, explains between one and
10 percent of the productivity increase.
Moreover, these challenges constraints affect overall growth rates. Cross-country growth
regressions have been used to identify statistically and economically significant determinants of
growth rates. While these regressions are not without their limitations77, they provide useful
information on counterfactual estimates on the potential impact on growth due to improvement of
different investment climate areas. Two recent studies are of interest to benchmark Costa Rica’s
economic growth: (i) Araujo et al (2014) studies economic growth in Latin American and the
Caribbean for 1970–2010, updating the work of Loayza, Fajnzylber, & Calderón (2005); and (ii)
Swiston and Barrot (2011) examine the role of structural reforms in raising economic growth in
Central America for 1960–2009.78 Benchmarking Costa Rica against top performers in LAC,
Araujo et al. (2014) found the largest effects on per capita GDP growth from lowering inflation,
increasing financial depth, increasing trade openness, improving infrastructure, and improving the
education level of the workforce.79 When Costa Rica is benchmarked against OECD countries, the
largest effects on growth will come from a better road infrastructure, greater financial depth,
lowering inflation, improving the education level of the workforce, and increasing trade openness.
The magnitude of the estimated effects suggests that per capita GDP growth could have been two
to 14 percent higher, providing an indication of forgone growth and its potential impact on poverty
reduction. Swiston and Barrot (2011) conclude that for structural reforms in the financial sector
76

Using a pooled sample of more than 10,000 firms from 16 Latin American countries, Fajnzylber et al. (2009)
estimated the impact of objective indicators of investment climate constraints (governance and institutional quality;
infrastructure; access to finance; and education, skills, and technology) on firm performance indicators, such as labor
productivity, total factor productivity, and wages. The authors benchmarked firm performance against five different
scenarios: moving to Ireland’s investment climate, moving to Chile’s investment climate, the 75 th percentile of the
entire sample of firms, the 75 th percentile within same industry and firm size, and the 75 th percentile within same
industry, firm size, and country.
77
Some of the limitations of cross-country growth regression include: omitted variables, instruments used for the
GMM estimation may be mis-specified, explanatory variables may not capture the structural or stabilization policies
that are most relevant, and risk of over-fitting the model.
78
These studies rely on cross-country regressions, using five-year non-overlapping data, and generalized method of
moments (GMM) estimators for dynamic models of panel data. The GMM estimation takes into account unobserved
country-specific effects and the joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables (growth drivers) with the dependent
variable (economic growth) in a dynamic model of panel data. Araujo et al. (2014) use a sample of 126 countries and
Swiston and Barrot (2011) use a sample of 79 countries. Araujo et al. (2014) classify the determinants of growth into
structural and stabilization policies. Structural policies include education (human capital), financial depth, trade
openness, government burden, infrastructure, and governance. Stabilization policies include measures of fiscal,
monetary, and financial policies, such as price stability and real exchange rate overvaluation. Swiston and Barrot
(2011) use a set of structural indexes to gauge the extent of reforms.
79
The analysis finds that, if Costa Rica were a top performance in government size (i.e., by having a smaller
government, as measured by government consumption expenditure as a share of GDP), its GDP per capita would be
12 percent higher. That is because the benchmarking exercise, due to the estimated coefficients of the model, views
government size as something negative to improve upon. However, one has to consider that Costa Rica may have
large government consumption due to its social compact, allocating around 23 percent of GDP to public health and
education.

52

(particularly improvement in bank supervision and development of domestic security markets) and
in product markets (agriculture liberalization, flexibility in electricity [independent regulator and
wholesale market], and telecommunications with private participation) could raise growth by
about two percentage points. In fact, Costa Rica has already undertaken a major reform in
telecommunications, which has contributed positively to economic activity.
Furthermore, competitiveness challenges could affect Costa Rica’s strong track record for
attracting FDI. The exit of Intel from its manufacturing operations, foreign investors’ growing
shift towards service functions, and increasing competition from other countries for FDI mean that
Costa Rica cannot lag behind in its capacity to upgrade the areas that are important to continue to
attract FDI and maximize their spillover into the local economy. A study of five global value chains
highlights areas that could strengthen their growth, such as increasing the supply of skilled labor.
The consequences of these competitiveness challenges have become more evident after the
global crisis. These challenges are the result of several forces: monetary and exchange rate policies
that have resulted in an appreciation of the exchange rate, an education system that is not
generating enough graduates demanded by the high-technology sectors, inadequate supply and
quality of infrastructure, and public sector administration that has not evolved quickly enough to
respond to the change of the economy. Addressing them will be important to preserve Costa Rica’s
competitive edge.
Exchange rate appreciation
Although inflation has dropped to single digits since the global crisis, the real effective
exchange rate has appreciated, negatively affecting Costa Rica’s international
competitiveness (Figure 4.15). 80 Domestic inflation persistently above that of the United States
(its major trading partner) and large capital inflows put appreciating pressure on the exchange rate.
The real effective exchange rate (REER) index appreciated by 12.3 percent in 2011–13, negatively
affecting Costa Rica’s international competitiveness. During that period, the Central Bank of Costa
Rica (BCCR) actively intervened in the foreign exchange market, buying foreign currency to keep
the exchange rate above the lower end of the target range. As a result, net international reserves
rose from US$4.8 billion at end-2011 to US$7.3 billion at end-2013. The BCCR sterilized the
resulting monetary expansion with domestic bonds, which pay a substantially higher interest than
the returns it gets on international reserves. Consequently, in 2013, the BCCR quasi-fiscal deficit
rose to 0.9 percent of GDP, and its debt stood at about 10 percent of GDP.

80

While the real exchange rate affects international competitiveness, it is an endogenous variable, which the authorities
can use only in the short term. In the longer term, competitiveness is determined by the structural factors elaborated
later in this chapter.

Greater exchange rate flexibility could have several advantages for the country. In early 2015,
the BCCR abandoned the exchange rate band, allowing more flexibility to the exchange rate, as
part of its transition to inflation targeting. Allowing pressures on the external position to be
absorbed by the exchange rate would facilitate facing external shocks and could help prevent a
sudden drop in reserves. Changes in world prices would be transmitted more directly to the local
economy, thereby aligning incentives to changing international conditions. Further, as both
creditors and debtors perceive higher risk regarding the direction and magnitude of exchange rate
fluctuations, the new exchange rate regime could lead to a gradual de-dollarization of the
economy.81
High wages and mismatch of skills and jobs
Relatively high wages have made Costa Rica less viable in low value-added sectors. High
income levels, coupled with generous social benefits, have resulted in high reservation wages
across the board. Figure 4.16 plots hourly wages (in constant 2001 US Dollars) between 2000 and
2012 in two sectors that traditionally employ low-skilled workers: agriculture (primary sector) and
low-tech industry (light manufacturing) for Central American countries and Chile (one of Costa
Rica’s structural peers). Except for Chile, Costa Rica displayed the highest wages in these sectors
over the period 2000–2012.82 After 2006, the gap in real wages between Costa Rican workers and
the others started to widen, but it did even more so after 2010, partly attributed to the appreciation
of the real effective exchange rate. Textile exports have dropped dramatically from 13.3 percent of
exports in 2000 to 1.6 percent in 2014, mainly attributed to high production costs in Cost Rica in
relation to neighboring countries.

81

The widespread dollarization of the economy adds vulnerability to the financial system and undermines the
effectiveness of monetary policy, since it operates on a smaller monetary base. As of December 2014, forty-one
percent of deposits and loans to the private sector were denominated in dollars.
82
The real wage in agriculture in Honduras dramatically increased in 2011, with no apparent explanation. This data
point is excluded from the graph.

Changing patterns in FDI and trade have created excess demand for high skills, putting
upward pressure on the salaries of high-skilled workers.83 Most of the reduction in jobs comes
from sectors that tend to employ low-skilled workers (Figure 3.2), such as agriculture and
construction. It is precisely in these sectors where job creation has been minimal or even negative
in the last six years (Figure 4.17). At the other end of the spectrum, sectors that employ mostly
skilled workers, such as financial services, real estate, personal services, and others, are growing
fast (though from a low base in the case of sectors such as utilities or financial services).

As such, returns to education have increased along with inequality in Costa Rica in the 2000s,
in contrast to trends in most other LAC countries. In much of the region, the returns to higher
levels of education began to fall in the 1990s—and continued during the 2000s—as more students
achieved higher levels of education. This decline in the returns to education contributed in part to
83

See World Bank (2006a) and Lücke (2013).

55

the historic fall in inequality in many LAC countries over the past 15 years.84 Costa Rica’s path
has been different from the rest of the region, for trends both in inequality and in the returns to
education. Specifically, in Costa Rica, the returns to education fell during the 1980s (over a decade
before similar patterns emerged in the region), thus contributing to a reduction in inequality during
that period.85 However, contrary to LAC, the returns to education remained roughly constant
during the 1990s and early 2000s in Costa Rica, and they started to rise again after 2007. Thus, the
premium for having completed secondary education rose by 11 percentage points between 2007
and 2013 and by six percentage points for those with any tertiary education (Figure 4.18). This is
consistent with a pattern of skill-biased technological change, which generates relatively more
skilled occupations, a phenomenon also documented in a study of the evolution of occupations
over the last two decades, and which shows that Costa Rica has followed a pattern of changes in
occupations similar to high-income countries.86

And yet, the workforce is not well adapted to the current needs of the labor market, creating
a deficit of workers with the skills demanded by the fastest growing sectors. Indeed, less than
half of the cohort 25–29 years old (42.3 percent) had achieved a secondary or higher education by
2010, which is worrisome for a country that aims for a structural shift into “new economy” sectors.
In turn, the higher education system is biased towards social sciences and does not sufficiently
generate graduates with the skills demanded, such as basic science and engineering (Figure 4.19).87
In other words, students still prefer to study careers that had growing demand during the 1980s
and 1990s, rather than those that have high demand (and growing wages) today.88 The technology
sectors, in particular, are affected by the relatively small skilled labor force. For example, a study
of skills needs in network technology estimates that the gap between demand and supply of skilled
labor in Costa Rica in 2011 was 36 percent, and for 2015 this gap was projected to expand to 48
percent; the worst among the eight Latin American countries included in the study.89 Another study

84

Gindling and Trejos (2004).
86
See Aedo et al. (2014).
87
This problem is more acute in private universities, which produce over half of the total graduates.
88
Some evidence also suggests that most students would not qualify for science programs because their scores in the
high school examination are too low, so their only available options for study are in social sciences and education.

estimated US$72 million, as a consequence of the lack of technicians and professionals in this
area. The technology sector is not the only one affected by this trend: CANATUR (Costa Rican
Chamber of Tourism), called attention to a shortage of human capital in the tourism industry.

Moreover, regulatory procedures do not facilitate the recognition of foreign degrees could
help to fill the skills gaps. The norms that govern the recognition of qualifications, particularly
the Regulations Governing Article 30 of the Agreement for Higher Education Coordination of
State Universities, were defined in 1986 and have not been updated. Institutional arrangements are
also fragmented: academic qualifications and university degrees are evaluated by the various
higher education institutions that form CONARE (Consejo Nacional de Rectores, National
Council of Rectors), while those granted by other kinds of higher education institutions (parauniversity institutions) are evaluated by the Council for Higher Education. Although CONARE
has defined common criteria for the documents needed for recognition, requirements for obtaining
recognition and equivalency may vary depending on the institution carrying out the evaluation.
There is no unified procedure for presenting appeals against adverse decisions.
The difficulties created by this fragmented and outdated system can result in denial of work
authorizations for otherwise qualified workers with foreign degrees. Thus, Costa Rica has
obstacles to either “produce” or “import” the high skills needed to sustain its high value-added
growth model. Regulations and procedures should be updated and unified, in line with
international criteria; and measures should be taken to facilitate accreditation, adoption of a list of
institutions with established quality, and efficient processing of “similar cases” whereby applicants
have similar titles, degrees, and qualifications as previous candidates.
Infrastructure: telecommunications, transport, and electricity
Infrastructure coverage and access are relatively good. Over several decades of investment, the
country built an extensive network of highway and feeder roads, electric power grids, and
telecommunication system in the context of the “Social Compact” that also put an emphasis on
providing universal access to infrastructure services that would improve the wellbeing of the
57

population.90 Costa Rica has two times the road and three times the rail density of the average
middle-income country and is behind only Lithuania and the OECD on these indicators (Figure
4.20). Access to electricity in rural areas and mobile services is nearly universal. The liberalization
of the telecommunication sector allowed for fast growth in access to mobile and broadband
services.91 The vast coverage of infrastructure has historically supported Costa Rica’s trade and
growth and standards of living.

Telecommunications
Despite progress in the coverage of telecommunication services, areas outside the Free Trade
Zones (FTZs) and in protected areas have lower access, creating regional disparities in
competitiveness for local firms. Between 2008 and 2012, the percentage of households with a
cellphone increased from 69 percent to 97 percent.92 During the same period, the percentage of
households with Internet access increased from 15 percent to 47 percent; however, it is still highly
concentrated in the Central region, with much lower access in areas with higher poverty rates or
with indigenous populations (top row of Figure 4.22). Interestingly, cantons that have Free Trade
Zones (FTZs) have on average better cellphone and Internet penetration (bottom row of Figure
4.22) than cantons with no FTZ. Internet access in cantons with FTZs is 15 percentage points
higher than in cantons without them (42 percent versus 27 percent, respectively). Similarly, cell
phone use is five percentage points higher in cantons with FTZs (ICT and quality broadband are
required in the high-tech sectors which predominate in the FTZs).93 At the other extreme, cantons
with Protected Areas, which attract tourists, have lower access than the rest.

92

World Bank (2013a).
This correlation does not address the underlying causality: did better infrastructure and ICT follow the creation of
an FTZ, or did FTZs choose to locate in cantons with better infrastructure and ICT? Nonetheless, the fact that FTZs
exist in cantons with better conditions provides an opportunity for service spillovers, and for firms to take advantage
of the agglomeration economies that infrastructure networks can facilitate.

Transport
Despite good access, the quality of transport services is deficient. On the two most widely used
international rankings of transport service provision—the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness Index and the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI)—Costa Rica
barely reaches the middle point among the 160–170 countries ranked, scoring below peer middleincome countries and well below the average OECD country. Costa Rica ranked 87th out of 160
countries on the 2014 LPI, with a score of 2.7 (Figure 4.24). Costa Rica’s score is comparable to
the middle-income average but well below the OECD average of 3.7. The country’s mediocre
ranking can be traced to poor performance in customs and border clearance, 94 but also to poor
quality of transport infrastructure, particularly in infrastructure that concerns port services. Costa
Rica’s score and rank on the quality of its port infrastructure is the lowest among middle-income
peers, scoring a 3.0 on port quality and ranking 115th out of 160 countries (Figure 4.21b). A bit

more promising is the air transport quality in which Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st (out of
160). The results for transport quality are similarly poor on the WEF’s competitiveness index.
Costa Rica scores about 40 percent of the maximum score of seven points on the index’s user
assessment of road and port quality (with scores of 2.8 and 3.0, respectively). This score puts the
country behind the performance of similar middle-income countries (which average 3.5 to 3.7) and
very far from the infrastructure services delivered in the average OECD country (5.2 to 5.3). In
contrast to other countries, Costa Rica has not made progress in its connectivity with global
shipping networks.
Weak road and port infrastructure cause major losses and delays in land and sea transport.95
An extreme example of poor road quality comes from rural routes serving the pineapple industry.
On the trip from farm to distribution center, product losses can be 50 percent larger than for the
much longer trip from Costa Rica to Rotterdam.96 Costa Rica also performs at the bottom of the
middle-income group in quality of its port infrastructure, with a score of 3.0, and ranking 115th
out of 160. A salient illustration is the Port of Limón. Responsible for most of Costa Rica’s
maritime traffic, the port has very low productivity and long delays: the median time between a
ship’s port arrival and its dock arrival is more than 15 hours, compared to a normally acceptable
range of five hours.97
Not surprisingly, firms in FTZs tend to rely more intensively on air transport—which is more
efficient than ports in Costa Rica. In value terms, about two-thirds of FTZs’ exports are shipped
via air transport, which is a more expensive but faster transport mode. Air transport becomes
attractive and cost-effective as a modal alternative when goods are highly perishable or, more
important, when value added is over a certain threshold. And although ports in Costa Rica have
the worst rating in the region, the air transport market appears to be competitive for LAC
standards.98 In fact, air transport quality in Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st out of 160 in the
LPI (Figure 4.21b).

Judging by regional benchmarks, Costa Rica’s air transport is among the most competitive on the continent: it is
served by more than 25 international carriers, it is in the top quintile of destinations in the Americas, and it is served
very competitively in a highly de-concentrated market.

Electricity
Electricity tariffs have increased significantly in recent years, affecting production costs.
Between 2007 and 2013, the real industrial electric tariff increased from eight to 20 US cents per
kWh (Figure 4.25). Industrial and commercial electricity tariffs are competitive relative to the rest
of Central America but high relative to other competitors with larger markets, such as China,
Mexico, and the United States.

Industrial

Weighted Average Tariff

The rise in electricity tariffs originates from a combination of factors due to the energy mix
and governance issues of the sector. First, due to its high reliance on hydropower generation, the
power sector is particularly vulnerable to rainfall variability. Hydropower output has been
increasingly variable over the past decade due to successive dry years, and the country has
62

struggled to meet demand with renewable energy sources.99 Between 2000 and 2013, the share of
thermal generation increased from one percent to 12 percent, raising the short-run marginal cost
of generation due to high fuel cost. Thus, the transition path toward a carbon neutral economy has
been a major challenge: in the last two years, existing thermal generation capacity has been
dispatched during the entire year. The cost of thermal generation is influenced by oil prices and by
expensive thermal generation leasing agreements. Fuel expenditures are now reflected in the
tariff.100 Second, although technical losses in transmission and distributions are low (10 percent)
compared to other countries, ICE’s operating performance could be improved (Figure 4.26). With
197 customers per employee, ICE (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, Costa Rican Electricity
Institute) is the worst performer among regional peers (Colombia, the Dominican Republic,
Honduras, Panama, and Uruguay). Although there is not data available on the level of salaries and
benefits provided to ICE’s employees, using data from the ENAHO the average central
government to private sector wage premium was estimated at 23 percent in 2012—and this
premium was 49 percent for other public sector entities (for example, state-owned enterprises).101
Third, high depreciation costs—due to an accelerated depreciation schedule—have also increased
operational costs that result in higher electricity tariffs. For example, depreciation accounted for
17 percent of generation cost in 2013.102 Finally, ICE expanded its generation capacity through
expensive leasing arrangements that have led to higher operational costs and electricity tariffs.
Although these arrangements allowed ICE to finance its generation expansion, they have carried
higher interest costs and shorter maturity than other financing alternatives. These leasing
arrangements (alquileres) accounted for 15.4 percent of operating costs in 2010–12 and will
increase to 19 percent in 2013–2015.103

The mechanism for the pass-through is complex and subject to modifications. For example, ARESEP introduced a
mechanism for partial pass-through during dry months to lower the impact on consumers; at the same time it approved

Indicators of service quality, such as waiting periods for new connections and frequency and
duration of outages, are below those of its structural peers. This is particularly troublesome
because of Costa Rica’s interest in developing high-tech industries for which highly reliable
electricity is essential. According to the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, private companies in
Costa Rica reported an average waiting period of 39 days for a new electricity connection, which
is the highest in Central America and 17 days higher than the regional average. Although in terms
of frequency of outages Costa Rican firms experience 1.3 outages in a typical month, this is higher
than OECD countries (0.4), Panama (0.6), or Uruguay (0.2). A similar pattern is observed for the
duration of outages. To address quality problems, ICE offers agreements to businesses in which
the quantity and quality of electricity supply are clearly indicated, and those businesses can finance
ICE’s investments in exchange for lower tariffs.104
Sector governance is weak, resulting in bottlenecks that affect the overall operational and
economic efficiency of the sector. The roles and responsibilities of ICE, ARESEP (Autoridad
Reguladora de los Servicios Públicos, Regulatory Authority of Public Services), and MINAE
(Ministerio de Ambiente, Energía y Telecomunicaciones, Ministry of Environment, Energy, and
Telecommunications) overlap in some areas, causing inefficient planning and policy formation
outcomes. MINAE is currently developing the VII national energy plan with public consultations
(“mesas de dialogo”). The key focus areas for the consultations are: energy efficiency, distributed
generation, optimizing the electricity matrix, and social and environmental issues. Costa Rica’s
institutional framework may not be sufficiently flexible to respond to the strategic and expansion
needs of the sector. ICE faces a significant financing gap (Costa Rica needs to invest over $8 billion
in the energy sector over the next twenty years), but there is no clear plan on how to increase
private sector participation to attract needed investment, especially considering the existing legal
constraints. The corporate governance of ICE compares somewhat poorly with peer countries in
Latin America (see Box 4.2)
Box 4.2: Corporate governance of state-owned electric utility ICE

“corporate governance index” when compared to a
peer group of 13 state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
operating in the Latin American region. ICE ranked
11th in the group, in terms of performance
orientation (process of setting objectives, the
instruments used to set objectives and their
enforcement, and the authority that conducts the
assessments). This is indeed one of the areas where
ICE seems to be weak.

Expansion of the electricity supply is constrained by social-environmental restrictions, the
capacity of ICE to finance new generation assets, and legal caps on private sector
participation. The first challenge is how to address an increasing gap between the demand and
supply of electricity with renewable sources only. Costa Rica will need to double its installed
capacity in the next 20 years. A large hydro project is under construction (Reventazon, 305 MW)
and will start operations in 2016–17, significantly contributing to increase the system’s reserve
margin. The project cost has been estimated at around US$1.4 billion, which at US$4.6 million
per MW is on the high end of the range for new hydropower projects in Central America and
clearly above global benchmarks. This much-needed capacity is necessary to ensure the security
of the country’s supply; however, the high capital cost will have an impact on the capital
components of the tariff (depreciation and return on assets). Indeed, investment costs could be
further reduced in future capacity additions if a competitive mechanism for granting hydro
concessions and resulting electricity contracts was in place. Another large hydro project (Diquis,
700 MW) is confronting complex environmental and social issues.105 Expanding generation
capacity with geo-thermal energy, which is not affected by rainfall variability and can be
dispatched in base-load, will require handling environmental regulations with protected areas as
most volcanos are in national parks. The second challenge is how to finance the large costs
associated with any project. ICE’s capacity to issue new debt is limited to certain thresholds. The
legal framework limits private sector participation through independent power producers (IPP) and
build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes to no more than 30 percent of installed capacity.
Addressing the infrastructure gap
The deficiencies in productive infrastructure raise concerns about the adequacy of the levels
of spending and implementation capacity for infrastructure projects. Costa Rica has made
significant efforts to increase infrastructure investment since the structural freeze of investment
imposed in the nineties but has not yet been able to leverage significant private sector funds. After
investing no public funds in infrastructure throughout the 1990s, Costa Rica has recommitted to
an investment program. In fact, in 2012 Costa Rica invested the most in infrastructure as a
percentage of GDP (5.47 percent) of any Latin American country.106 However, the vast majority
of this investment is public sector spending: private participation represents only 10 percent of
total spending (Figure 4.27). The necessity of continuing to invest in infrastructure and the reality
of fiscal constraints mean that Costa Rica must encourage more private sector participation in the
construction and maintenance of its infrastructure. The lack of investment in maintenance is
particularly acute in the road sector, where a cycle of underinvestment leading to deterioration that
requires still more resources has been created.107

Expenditure on public infrastructure is uneven across sectors, implementation is deficient,
and expenditure has not been able to keep up with needed investments. Public investment has
been dominated by the transport and energy sectors with increasing investment in
telecommunications in recent years. Historically, investment in water and sanitation has been very
low, but there has been a recent increase. Poor implementation of infrastructure projects also
contributes to the large infrastructure gap.108 For example, the Legislative Assembly takes between
1.5 to 2.2 years to approve external loans by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Also,
of the $2,000 million in loans from multilateral institutions only 28 percent has been executed. 109
Limited execution is also reflected in the contraction of 2.6 percent, while it grew in most sectors.
A failure of institutions is also apparent in the roads sector where resources made available by
multilateral organizations have not been put to use because of inadequate management.
Infrastructure limitations and growing environmental challenges could affect further
expansion of the tourism industry. As discussed earlier, the stock of infrastructure covers most
of the country, protected areas still have coverage deficiencies, and in particular quality of
infrastructure is low. Moreover, the growing urban population creates pressure on public services
like waste management (solid and water), which do not comply with international standards for
environmental sustainability. To make sure that green tourism can continue to grow in Costa Rica,
it is necessary to coordinate the efforts of a large number of public actors, from infrastructure,
health, training, and other institutions.
Business regulations
Business regulations and red tape also affect competitiveness. Costa Rica ranks poorly in many
indexes of competitiveness (Figure 4.28): Doing Business 2015 (83rd out of 189 countries),
Protecting Investors (181st), Enforcing Contracts (129th), Paying Taxes (121st), Starting a

growth. The complex organization of the government and lack of coordination among agencies
produce lack of clarity regarding steps and agencies and time to process regulatory requirements.
For example, when the telecommunication sector was liberalized, the new private entrants reported
delays in installing their systems due to the slow approval of tower building permits by the
municipalities.110 Environmental, health, and construction are the areas mostly affected by these
factors.

Access to finance
Costa Rica’s financial system is highly dollarized and dominated mainly by public banks,
although the system has become more diversified in recent years. Dollarization is widespread
in Costa Rica. Forty-one percent of deposits and loans to the private sector were denominated in
dollars at the end of 2014 (Figure 4.29).111 Higher interest rates for loans in local currency and a
stable exchange rate explain the attractiveness of borrowing in dollars. The widespread
dollarization of the economy adds vulnerability to the financial system and undermines the
effectiveness of monetary policy since it operates on a smaller monetary base.112 Public banks
account for 50 percent of the system’s lending to the private sector, private banks’ share is 31.4

110

World Bank (2013a).
Dollarization of private credit increased from five percent in 1992 to 50 percent in 2003. Since then, it has decreased
slowly to its current level of 41 percent.
112
In response, authorities have put in place prudential measures to discourage lending in dollars to non-foreign
exchange generators and to reduce the banks’ open foreign exchange positions. The authorities granted a four-year
implementation period in 2013 to allow the banks to gradually rebalance their loan portfolios and adapt to new
regulations.

Credit to the private sector has grown slowly, and its level is below that for structural peers.
Liberalization of the banking sector in the mid-1990s reignited credit, which grew from a low 18.5
percent in 1998 to 32 percent in 2004 and 50 percent in 2013 (Figure 4.30). This level of financing
is still low when compared to structural peers and OECD countries (Figure 4.31).

Credit growth slowdown after the global crisis and its growth has been uneven across sectors.
Credit growth accelerated in 2014, reaching 17 percent as a result of the government having
removed in August 2013 the limits it had imposed at the beginning of the year. Credit in foreign
currency grew faster than in local currency, but that trend has so far been reversed in 2014 when
credit in local currency grew faster (Figure 4.32). Growth in credit is uneven across different
68

sectors of the economy. The area of highest growth within banks’ portfolio is retail lending
(consumer and housing), which averaged 52.6 percent of private credit in 2010–14, double the
average in the 1990s (25.7 percent). Lending for housing, services, and consumers have increased
their share of total credit (Figure 4.33). In contrast, the share of lending to agriculture and industries
decreased in the past two decades to 4.4 percent in 2010–2014.

The penetration of financial services among firms and the population, especially the poor, is
low. Costa Rican firms do not compare favorably in their use of banks to finance investments or
working capital (22 and 30 percent, respectively) when compared to the Latin American average
or structural peers (see Figure 4.34). In the case of individuals, access to finance indicators are
above regional peers; however, poorer segments (for example, the bottom 40 percent of income
earners) of the Costa Rican population have much more limited access. According to the World
Bank Financial Inclusion database from 2011 (Findex), 50 percent of the Costa Rican population
over the age of 15 has an account at a formal financial institution, well above the regional average
of 39 percent; however, large disparities exist, as just over one-third of those in the bottom 40
percent of income earners has access to financial services. The 2013 income and expenditure
survey shows that having savings accounts or receiving a loan from any source is highly unequal
across quintiles.

2014, well above international standards. Non-performing loans (NPLs) stood at 1.7 percent, with
high level of provisions. Profitability, measured as return on equity, was stable in 2013/2014 at
around eight percent, but lower than other countries in the region, such as Chile (21 percent) or
Panama (15.6 percent).

The sustainability of its development model is at risk due to the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions in the
Social Compact, and various threats to the Green Trademark. The fiscal situation stands out as one of the most
pressing development challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent deterioration stems from a combination of
countercyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces. Without fiscal consolidation, the
deficit could push public debt to unsustainable levels and threaten the country’s social and economic gains. Indeed,
fiscal pressures, as well as rising inequality and increasing dissatisfaction with social services, all combine to
create tensions in the Social Compact. Costa Rica’s leadership in environmental conservation faces the challenge
of growing pressures on the use of resources and of urbanization. Changing economic incentives threaten the gains
in reforestation, and the use of agro-chemicals is worrisome. Urbanization has increased energy use and air and
water pollution, and the country has not developed a long-term plan to protect the environment from these threats.
Finally, the current political landscape and institutional framework add an additional layer of complexity for
approving and implementing key reforms needed to address these emerging challenges.

The fiscal situation is arguably one of the most pressing development challenges facing Costa
Rica. Growing deficits could push the public debt to unsustainable levels and constrain resources
for public investment, social services, and environmental goals.
Fiscal deterioration since the global crisis: deficits and public debt
The fiscal situation has weakened substantially since the global crisis, with the overall deficit
of the Central Government growing to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and is projected to have
surpassed six percent in 2014 and to reach 6.6 in 2015.113 As a result, public debt has increased by
12 percentage points over the past five years, from 25 percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent by
2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019 unless corrective measures are implemented (Figure
5.1).114 A study by the IMF estimates that Costa Rica has to lower its primary deficit by 3.5 percent
of GDP to achieve debt sustainability and by 4.5 percent of GDP to bring its debt ratio to the precrisis level.115

Fiscal deterioration after the global crisis is not unique to Costa Rica. Figure 5.2 and Figure
5.3 present the overall and primary deficits, respectively, of Costa Rica and of the structural peer
countries. The fiscal balance worsens for all countries. However, although Costa Rica was among
the better performing countries before the crisis (third below Chile and Uruguay), after the crisis
it was among the worst: its primary balance was only slightly smaller than Lithuania, and its overall
deficit was the largest of the group. 116
A consequence of weakening fiscal accounts is the downgrading of Costa Rica’s investment
rating. In September 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services downgraded the country's rating
due to fiscal trends and the foreseen difficulties in passing a comprehensive tax reform that could
put the debt on a sustainable path. The longer the delay to address the fiscal deficit, the larger will
be the adjustment needed to stabilize the public debt ratio and the potential impact on the poorer
segments of the population.

116

Although in 2002 Costa Rica had a fiscal deficit higher than four percent of GDP, almost all of it was due to interest
payments. Nowadays, interest payments are around half that amount, and the overall deficit reflects a growing primary
deficit, following the steep increases in public expenditures.

72

The growing deficit: cyclical measures and structural forces
This recent fiscal deterioration stems from countercyclical measures undertaken during the
crisis and structural forces. Moreover, countercyclical measures adopted during the crisis were
structural, rather than temporary, further adding to existing rigidities in government finances and
spending.
The set of policy actions taken to confront the global economic crisis has long-lasting
implications for fiscal accounts. As in many other countries, Costa Rica faced the global crisis
by implementing countercyclical fiscal policies. This was welcomed, given the magnitude of the
crisis and the fiscal space the country had at the time, because the primary balance was positive
and public debt was below 25 percent of GDP in 2008. However, unlike other countries, which
implemented temporary fiscal policies, Costa Rica adopted policies with long-lasting structural
effects. Specifically, it chose to implement steep, permanent increases in public salaries in 2008–
10, and the wage bill of the public sector continued to grow even after the crisis. Current transfers
also doubled to five percent of GDP. And revenues, which had increased steeply prior to the crisis,
dropped back to average levels from 2000–05 (Figure 5.1).
Public sector wages are particularly high in Costa Rica, as compared with other countries
and the private sector. The public sector wage policy adopted during the crisis aimed to increase
salaries in the central government to the 50th percentile (known as the Percentil 50) of pay for
similar jobs in the rest of the public sector. Originally intended to adjust the wages of some
categories of public sector workers, it expanded throughout most entities of the central government
as well as decentralized institutions.117 As such, the wage bill of the central government rose
(increasing from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4 percent in 2014), and the consolidated wage
bill of the overall public sector expanded significantly (climbing from seven percent of GDP to 10
percent in 2010). Public sector compensation is much higher in Costa Rica than in other countries,
given its level of GDP and government revenues—and public sector wages are significantly higher

117

For example, the wage increase was applied to teachers because they should receive the same salaries or benefits
increases as other parts of the central government (Estado de la Nación, 2014).

Another “big ticket item” on the expenditure side is pensions. Costa Rica’s public pension
system includes the main pension fund (Seguro de Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte), a non-contributory
social pension, and special pension regimes for teachers, civil servants, and the judiciary. The first
two are managed by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS), which also operates the
universal health insurance system. Although the CCSS pension accounts are currently roughly
balanced, with aging and demographic pressures they will likely face an imbalance in the
foreseeable future. Even more pressing are the balances of the special pension regimes. Overall
government support to special pension regimes will cost Costa Rica about 59 percent of (2012)
GDP over the next four decades.118 A recent study by the IMF projects that the special regime for
the judiciary will start to run deficits very soon, and will deplete its assets by 2030; the special
regime for the civil service is projected to run flat at 2.4 percent of GDP through 2020, and will
slowly diminish after that. Moreover, the special regimes are far more generous than the CCSS
regime, which raises the question of equity, apart from their burden on the fiscal accounts.119 For
instance, in 2012, the CCSS spent 2.2 percent of GDP in general pension payments for 190,000
pensioners, against 2.6 percent of GDP for 62,500 pensioners of the special regimes. And while
the average annual pension of a retired worker of the general system of the CCSS amounts to
around 50 percent of GDP per capita, the average pension of a retired civil servant is about 170
percent of GDP per capita, and the average pension of a retired judge is about 270 percent of GDP
per capita.
Managing expenditures is further complicated by extensive rigidities built into the system.
These rigidities stem from the indexation of public sector wages and pensions, as well as numerous
spending mandates. These include both constitutional expenditure mandates without
corresponding financing sources, as well as legally required expenditures.120 For example, there is
118

119

74

a constitutional mandate to increase expenditures in education from six to eight percent of GDP.
There are also legal mandates for allocations to municipalities, housing subsidies, earmarked taxes,
wages, pensions, and interest payments on the debt. The sum total of all of these rigidities leaves
the government with only five percent of the annual budget for strategic allocative decisions in
any given year—and also limits its ability to control expenditures and the deficit. 121
Further, the budget process is fragmented and much of it is outside the control of the central
government. Parliament approves only the budget of the central government, which represents
about one-third of consolidated public expenditures. The budgets of decentralized institutions,
public enterprises, financial intermediaries, and de-concentrated entities is determined largely by
their heads under budget caps and guidelines provided by the Ministry of Finance and subject to
modification and monitoring by the Office of the Comptroller General (CGR).
Structural rigidities also prevail on the revenue side. Although overall revenue collection is on
par with upper-middle- and high-income countries, at around 22 percent of GDP, tax revenues are
low (13.5 percent of GDP) and a large share of the remaining revenues are earmarked to
autonomous public institutions (such as social security contributions for pensions and health
insurance, which are managed by the CCSS). Moreover, since 1953, Parliament has approved
1,259 tax exemptions, of which only 23 percent had a time limit. Further, nearly half of these
exemptions have no clear definition of the tax that is exempted.122 The potential magnitude of
these exemptions for revenues is quite large, amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP. Finally, the budgets
of SOEs do not require Parliamentary approval, and SOEs do not publish data. In an attempt to
address the situation, Congress approved a fiscal reform in 2012, but it was deemed
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on the basis of procedural irregularities.
In addition, coordination between fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy is limited. Fiscal
policy has not been sufficiently coordinated with monetary policy, and the fiscal deficit is adding
to inflationary pressures. The BCCR-stated objective is to move to a fully inflation-targeting
system, and the recent measure of floating the exchange rate, abandoning the pre-defined bands,
is a move in the right direction. It is expected that this policy change will reduce dollarization of
the financial system, reducing a source of vulnerability.

To ensure sustainability of the Social Compact, Costa Rica must confront the triple
challenges of fiscal pressures on social spending, increasing dissatisfaction with public
services, and rising inequality. First, the deterioration of the fiscal system implies potential
tradeoffs among social goals—and the need for improved quality and efficiency of social spending.
Second, increasing dissatisfaction with the quality of health care symbolizes the numerous “cracks
in the system” that are emerging in the delivery of public services. There is a sense that, although
Costa Rica has achieved impressive “levels” of performance for many indicators (low poverty, life
expectancy, literacy), it is increasingly constrained on the “deltas” of adopting the changes needed
to make the transition to a modern economy with an effective “Welfare State” in the context of
demographic transition. Third, rising inequality has exposed disparities in the education system
and the mismatch of skills and jobs, as well as the ineffectiveness of social transfers to redistribute
income to compensate for these inequities.
The long rise of social spending
Costa Rica’s Social Compact has deep historical roots. The construction of the Social Compact
goes back to Costa Rica’s early days as a coffee-producing economy of small landholders (see
Chapter 1). It was consolidated during the middle of the 20th century with the creation of the
universal health and social security system Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS) in 1941,
the establishment of the Labor Code in 1942, the guaranteeing of public education for all, and the
1949 Constitution, which mandated basic social rights (complemented by extensive social welfare
legislation).
This ambitious Social Compact has had the backing of high and rising social spending. With
the abolition of the army, the country had more resources to invest in the provision of basic public
and social services to the entire population. As a result, social spending started to rise in the 1950s,
reaching over three percent of GDP by 1958 (Figure 5.6). It then increased steadily over the
decades, reaching almost 10 percent by the end of the 1990s and 20.8 percent by the end of the
first decade of the 2000s. This is close to the average level spent by OECD countries,123 and
significantly higher than Central American neighbors (Figure 5.7). Investment in education was
initially the highest category of social spending, but by the 1990s health and pensions had both
surpassed education. In 2012, total social spending amounted to 20.8 percent of GDP, with 7.4
percent for pensions, seven percent for health, 5.3 percent for education, and 1.1 percent for social
assistance.

123

Public social spending in OECD countries averages 21.4 percent of GDP on health, social services, and social protection
benefits, plus another 5.4 percent of GDP on education, for a total of 26.8 percent of GDP. Sources: OECD 2014 update, OECD

Some key achievements of the Social Compact: universal coverage of basic services
The Social Compact has achieved many successes, particularly in the delivery of universal
services such as health care. Universal access to the health care system has led to outstanding
health outcomes for the population. The country’s integrated and universal health care system,
managed by the CCSS, has provided access to health care to the entire population, including the
bottom 40 percent (Figure 5.8). Universal health care has been a key factor in improving key social
indicators: life expectancy in Costa Rica is 82 for women and above 77 for men, and child mortality
is low (about half of the Latin American and Caribbean average). Institutional births are virtually
universal and maternal mortality has fallen over the last 20 years, reaching levels that are less than
half of the LAC average.

The country has also invested heavily in infrastructure, providing the population with
universal access to electricity and water, and an extensive road network covers most of the
country. Early on, Costa Rica built an extensive network of infrastructure in nearly all productive
service areas (water, sanitation, transport, electricity, and telecommunications), responding to
strong social demand.124 Access to electricity went from 40 percent of households in 1950 to 99
percent by 2013. Access to improved water sources is also nearly universal, with 96 percent of
households having access to piped water and 92 percent with access to drinking water. Costa Rica
has twice the road density and three times the rail density of the average middle-income country,
and is behind only Lithuania and the OECD on these indicators. Coverage of telephone lines
increased dramatically, from 11 fixed telephone lines per 1000 inhabitants in 1950 to 203 in 2012.
Almost all households have access to a cell phone (94 percent, higher than the OECD average)
and 50 percent to a fixed phone line in 2013.125 This large endowment of infrastructure has
historically supported Costa Rica’s economic growth and standards of living.
Health care: increasing concerns about quality and sustainability
Overall health spending has continued to grow during the 2000s, raising concerns about
sustainability. Between 2000 and 2010, total expenditure on health went from 6.5 percent of GDP
to 10.1 percent. By 2012, public expenditure was around seven percent of GDP.126 This is far
higher than public health spending for countries of similar levels of development (Figure 5.9), and
it exceeds average public spending on health in OECD countries (which averages 6.2 percent of
GDP).127
Moreover, recent increases in health spending have not been matched by gains in service
delivery. Between 2005 and 2010, the CCSS experienced a rapid increase in spending without
revenue growth, where 97 percent of the extra spending corresponded to an increase in the number

suggest that between 2009 and 2011, average daily hospital production dropped from 69 to 61
days, and the number of annual outpatient visits per professional declined from 758 to 654.128
Hence, recent increases in spending have not translated into better services.

Health budget allocations do not take into account demographic and demand changes, and
thus leads to inefficiency and inequality of care. Budget allocation for health facilities across
the country is done on the basis of historical allocation, instead of current needs stemming from
demographic pressures and local morbidity patterns. As a result, the resources that health centers
receive are disconnected from the resources they need, and this is leading to inequity in the
capacity to deliver care.
Furthermore, the current organization of the system leads to increasing wait times and
patient frustration. The demographic change in Costa Rica implies that as the population ages,
chronic conditions—which are more costly to treat—will become more prevalent. Yet, the 3-level
organization of healthcare (going back to the 1970s) is not well adapted to a growing number of
patients with chronic conditions. Level-1 facilities are not equipped to deal with such patients, thus
they refer them to level-2 or level-3 facilities, which also have to deal with more complex cases.
This creates bottlenecks, whereas a more consolidated system would be able to deal with chronic
cases (of low complexity).
Likewise, an outdated infrastructure and information management system lowers quality,
and decreases transparency and efficiency of resource management. The current health
infrastructure does not reflect the high level of spending: Costa Rica is considerably below the
average of its peers both in density of hospital beds and medical staff, and a recent assessment by
the CCSS found that only 26 percent of hospitals and clinics were in good or excellent condition.129
In addition, the information management system, which dates back to the 1970s, has not been
adequately modernized, and as a result it is highly fragmented and information flows are very
difficult. This hampers efficient resource management and lowers the accountability of the entire

79

system (for example, most information systems, except clinical records in some health centers, are
paper-based or at best spreadsheets not linked to aggregated databases).
As a result, private health costs are on the rise, and the perception of quality is declining.
Between 1995 and 2010 the share of private out-of-pocket spending has gone from 23.5 percent
to 31.9 percent (of total health spending). This has occurred in parallel to the aging of the country’s
population, which has naturally increased the demand for health services. As a result, users of the
CCSS face increasingly long wait times, in particular for surgery and specialized treatments. Not
surprisingly, patients who can afford private insurance policies often use them, not to pay for
complementary services to those covered by the CCSS, but to get the same services with a
preferential treatment. This lowers the transparency of the system, and generates inequities in
access and quality of treatment, which in turn fuels patient dissatisfaction (Figure 5.10).

Education: patterns of public spending versus the skills gap
Similarly, Costa Rica has historically spent a large share of GDP on education. During the
sustained growth period between 1950 and 1980, Costa Rica considerably expanded its investment
in human capital, particularly in education. By the end of the 1950s, education expenditure was
over two percent of GDP, and by 1980 it had reached 4.4 percent. 130 The crisis of the early 1980s
caused a sharp reduction in public spending across the board (Figure 5.11); for example, education
spending fell to 1.9 percent of GDP by 1982, and by 1990 it was still only at 3.3 percent of GDP,
one percentage point below the spending share of 1980. Nonetheless, education spending increased
systematically over the 1990s and 2000s, as the Assembly approved spending targets of six percent
of GDP in 1997 (reached by 2009) and eight percent of GDP in 2010 (projected to be reached by

spent by OECD countries on average.132

Education spending is in the “mid-range” between middle-income and high-income
countries. Measuring education spending as a share of GDP is useful for assessing its trend over
time, as well as its fiscal implications. However, when comparing with other countries, measuring
per student spending as a share of GDP per capita allows us to take into consideration the country’s
size and level of development.133 With this adjusted measure, Costa Rica spends relatively more
than some LAC countries and even on par with some high-income countries (HICs) like Australia,
the Republic of Korea, Israel, or Singapore, but relatively less than Brazil, Mexico, and all other
OECD countries (Figure 5.12). Moreover, compared to the high-performing Scandinavian
countries, Costa Rica spends significantly less per student, even relative to its much smaller GDP
per capita. As discussed earlier, this investment in education has translated into important
achievements in terms of literacy and primary education attainment.

The estimated education expenditure for 2012 (5.3 percent of GDP) shown in Figure 5.6 differs from the official
figure, as it takes into account only executed budget. See World Bank (forthcoming 2015).

133
Another option is to compare expenditure per student in PPP US Dollars; however, the largest education
expenditure item is teacher salaries (a non-tradable good), thus, even the PPP correction places too large a weight on
high-income countries’ expenditures.

completing high school, many of them
as early as seventh grade, as discussed in Chapter 3). Compared with other countries, both the
share of public spending on secondary and spending per secondary-school student are low for
Costa Rica, given its level of development (Figure 5.14).

As a result of high dropout rates at the secondary level, public spending in education becomes
regressive at higher levels. Given that a larger share of children from lower-income households
drop out of secondary education, those who remain enrolled in the system and eventually access
tertiary education tend to come from middle- and upper-class households. As Figure 5.15 shows,
spending in tertiary education goes mostly to upper-income quintiles, in contrast to spending in
primary, which is more heavily directed to lower-income quintiles. Given that tertiary education is
allocated 32 percent of the total education budget, the result is a regressive system where most
Costa Rican households are subsidizing the education of a minority of well-off children.134

Given fiscal constraints, rising inequality, and the mismatch of skills and jobs, Costa Rica
needs to increase the efficiency of spending with a focus on improving quality and completion

rates. As discussed in Chapter 3, the low results in school attainment and quality are worrisome,
given the high share of spending on public education and the shift in labor demand towards highskilled labor. Thus, the solution is not to spend more, but to spend better, by increasing the
efficiency of spending to achieve better results. Some reform options are discussed in Chapter 6.
Social protection: not so effective for reducing poverty or inequality
Social protection spending, which includes social security and social assistance, is high by
regional standards. Between 2007 and 2012 social protection spending rose from 7.3 percent of
GDP to 8.5 percent of GDP (left panel of Figure 5.16). This is less than what is spent in OECD
countries (which average 12.3 percent on old age and working age benefits),135 and is considerably
higher than in neighboring countries, such as El Salvador (5 percent), Honduras (6.1 percent) or
Panama (5.8 percent).136 The largest share within social protection spending corresponds to social
security (that is, contributory pensions), whereas social assistance spending represents only 1.1
percent of GDP, similar to the share in Guatemala (1.1 percent), Nicaragua, and Panama (0.9
percent) and below El Salvador (2.6 percent). During the crisis of 2009, the government increased
social protection spending, particularly cash transfers, which doubled in terms of GDP percentage
from 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent.137 All other spending categories remained largely unchanged
during the period (right panel of Figure 5.16).

Pension coverage is high, but different pension regimes exacerbate inequities. A look at
pension coverage among the elderly reveals that, though not universal, coverage is rather large for
LAC standards.138 Indeed, by 2013, 58 percent of the elderly in the bottom income quintile
received a pension (of which 40 percent was non-contributory), and 67 percent of the elderly in
135

Much of these increases were directly linked to an increase in the public sector’s base salary, which had
repercussions for pension payments, including non-contributory pensions. See also the previous section on fiscal
accounts.

the top quintile also received a pension (where 64 percent were contributory pensions). Thus, twothirds of the elderly receive some form of pension, and there is very little inequality in terms of
coverage across income quintiles (Figure 5.17). Yet, the elderly poor are much more likely to
receive non-contributory pensions, which are clearly smaller than contributory pensions.
Moreover, among those that receive contributory pensions, there is a stark difference between
pensioners of the public sector and private sector regimes. The special regimes (now mostly closed
to current workers) pay significantly more generous benefits than those provided by the CCSS for
the general population. This is not only a source of inequity but also raises sustainability questions,
as discussed in the previous section.

Moreover, most major social assistance programs are not well targeted. As the top panel of
Figure 5.19 shows, even the “best” targeted programs, such as the non-contributory pension, have
about half of their beneficiaries in the bottom quintile. At the other end, a program like school
85

meals provides most of its benefits to non-poor children, and a similar situation occurs with
training programs from INA (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje, National Learning Institute).
Putting Costa Rica in an international context (bottom panel of Figure 5.19) reveals that there is
significant room for improving the targeting accuracy of its programs. For example, 74 percent of
cash transfers in the CCT Red de Oportunidades of Panama (one of Costa Rica’s structural peers)
go to the poorest quintile, against 44 percent for Avancemos. Thus, it is unclear how effective Costa
Rica’s programs can be to help the poor (and especially the poorest) bridge the gaps created by
low human capital and low access to jobs.

Furthermore, social assistance is widely seen as “welfare assistance” instead of a system to
lift people out of poverty. Despite a broad political and social support for social programs for the
poor, there is a common view both in the government and in the society, that social programs are
not effective in generating capabilities that would enable people to escape poverty. They are rather
seen as a retaining wall that prevents further increases of poverty, especially during crises, as seems
to be the case with some programs like the CCT Avancemos (Figure 5.20), but they have little
impact on overall poverty. Yet, many social programs were conceived expressly to boost incomegenerating capabilities. This is the case of all school support programs (school meals, Fondo
Nacional de Becas (National Scholarship Fund, FONABE) scholarships, and Avancemos), but also
of the early childhood programs (Red de Cuido/CEN-CINAI), the housing programs (BAHNVI),
86

and other smaller training and entrepreneurship programs. The lack of a culture of evaluation and
social accountability within the social sector (and beyond) has contributed to the view that social
programs have “no impact” and that they only serve as basic safety nets. In the long term, this can
undermine the legitimacy and the public support for them.

Finally, a significant challenge for the efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection
system is its fragmentation and institutional complexity. Institutional arrangements in the
management and financing of social programs are highly complex (Figure 5.21). Before funds can
be used by an implementing agency (for example IMAS (Joint Institute for Social Assistance),
they flow through various channels, in particular FODESAF (National Development and Family
Allocations Fund, run by the Ministry of Labor), which distributes funds from the central
government to various programs, based on an allocation formula set by law. The resulting
earmarking makes budget allocation inflexible; and because more than 50 percent of FODESAF’s
budget is earmarked, it is difficult to track financial flows and to assess the cost effectiveness of
programs.139
Knowledge gap 5.1: How can Costa Rica improve the effectiveness and coordination of its social
programs?
Social policy is fragmented across numerous institutions in Costa Rica, many of them autonomous agencies.
Consequently, more than two dozen social programs operate in parallel, often with similar target groups.
What is the mapping of social programs by agency, objectives, coverage, and performance? How can these
duplications (and resulting gaps in coverage for some population groups) be reduced, either through
consolidation of programs, integration of Social Registries (such as the SIPO, operated by IMAS, and the
SINIRUBE (National System of Registration of Beneficiaries), operated by FODESAF), or more ambitious
institutional consolidation? This is the topic of a new non-lending technical assistance being requested by
the Government of Costa Rica.

Costa Rica is regarded as a world leader in conservation and has made significant
achievements in reforestation. Over the last 30 years, forest cover has increased from 26 percent
to 52 percent (Figure 5.22). This has been made possible through public and private engagement
and the use of economic incentives for conservation (under the 1996 Forest Law and its Payment
for Environment Services [PES] framework), which have served as important drivers for
promoting forest conservation, reforestation, and afforestation (Chapter 1, Box 1.2). These have
proven critical to Costa Rica’s development strategy, given the country’s recognition as an
international ecotourism destination. The tourism industry generated income of US$2.3 billion in
2013, representing around 44 percent of total service exports or 19 percent of merchandise exports
(Chapter 4). Approximately 40 percent of tourists visited national parks. Costa Rica continues to
strive for “green” leadership with its international commitment in 2009 (at the UN Summit on
Climate Change) to become a carbon neutral nation by 2021 (Chapter 1, Box 1.2).

However, its Green Trademark and its commitment to carbon neutrality are at risk. Being
green and carbon neutral at the same time entails not only maintaining the current levels of forest
cover, but also reducing the current levels of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from all sectors.
This is a challenging task given the trade-offs built into the current economic incentive structure
for forest conservation and reforestation, which is dependent on revenues generated from tax on
gasoline. While a large share of GHG emissions can be reduced through better management of
forested and agricultural land, the country also needs to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels
coming from transport, construction, and increasingly from general electricity consumption.140

140

About 66 percent of total energy consumption is based on oil products such as gasoline and diesel (Blanco 2014).

88

Knowledge gap 5.2: How can Costa Rica link sustainable production and rural landscapes to its
conservation model?
Costa Rica’s well-known Green Trademark has been centered on a conservation approach, supported by
public sector economic incentives for conservation and reforestation (the PES mechanism) and eco-tourism
resources. Fiscal and economic pressures, as well as scope, bring into question the sustainability of that
model. How can Costa Rica adapt to the next generation of the green agenda, going beyond conservation and
nature protection towards innovative ways for mainstreaming conservation into productive landscapes, and
beyond carbon neutrality towards resilience? Further work under the programmatic NLTA on Green and
Inclusive Growth seeks to bring further evidence to this important policy question.

The current environmental regulatory framework favors a strong conservation approach
that has limited productive opportunities. During the last four decades, the focus on
conservation has led to the development of a nature-based tourism sector, on the one hand, and a
significant contraction of the domestic timber industry, on the other. Costa Rica has become a net
importer of processed and finished wood products, such as furniture.141 As the demand for wood
and processed timber has been steadily increasing over the last decade, underinvestment in the
timber industry has led to a 36.4 percent drop in output of processed timber between 2007 and
2012 and an increase in the exports of low-value unprocessed products (such as palettes [tarimas],
construction material, sawn wood). Agricultural productivity of many of Costa Rica’s main crops
has also seen a declining trend (coffee, in particular) (Chapter 4), which affects the livelihood of
rural populations engaged in agriculture. The focus on conservation has also limited the country’s
potential to meet increasing energy needs through renewable energy generation (such as
hydropower, geothermal, and biomass), which would require the exploitation of resources located
within the boundaries of protected areas.
Efforts to maintain or further increase the forest cover are undermined by rising opportunity
costs. The fiscal weight of Costa Rica’s conservation and reforestation program can prove too
heavy to sustain in the longer term, with more pressing social and economic issues that the country
faces in the short term and an increasing opportunity cost of alternative land-use options. More
profitable non-traditional export crops such as pineapples, bananas, or oil palm are becoming more
economically attractive, with land owners opting out of the conservation and reforestation
programs once the contracts are phased out. Although these activities generate employment in rural
areas, they may jeopardize Costa Rica’s achievements in countering deforestation trends and
promoting a green image, unless land use change is adequately managed and potential negative
environmental externalities (such as heavy use of agro-chemicals—see Figure 5.23) are
internalized through effective mechanisms (such as organic production). If in the medium to long
term Costa Rica wants to continue increasing or maintaining its current forest cover, the regulatory
framework governing its management and associated incentives needs to be reviewed and adapted
to a growth strategy that considers the role of forest conservation in the context of a rural
productive space that is increasingly vulnerable to weather changes.

Moreover, rapid urbanization has brought new challenges for the country. Costa Rica’s urban
population has been growing rapidly, from 50 percent of the total population in 1990 to 75 percent
in 2013. The first challenge relates to the transportation area and associated carbon emissions and
air pollution. Increasing energy demand is boosting the use of fossil fuels and raising air pollution
levels, mainly through a significant increase in road-based transport. Growing and aging vehicle
fleets and increased congestion are key drivers, especially in the San José Greater Metropolitan
Area (GMA).142 Energy subsidies, especially for transport fuels, further magnify this development
by incentivizing inefficient use of vehicles. However, the public transportation system in the GMA
is obsolete (all routes converge to the city center) and contributes to gridlock. The economic costs
of urban air pollution in Costa Rica amount to about CRC 210 billion (about one percent of GDP).
Around 350 premature deaths and close to 4,700 lost Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) are
attributable to urban air pollution (Particulate Matter (PM) exposure). The second set of challenges
emerging from urbanization includes sewage treatment and solid-waste management. Although
access to sanitation is almost universal (Chapter 3), 96 percent of all urban wastewater collected
is discharged into rivers and receiving water bodies without any treatment, generating public health
risks and water resources contamination (Figure 5.24). Only eight percent of the population is
connected to a sewage system and to a wastewater treatment plant. In San José, only four out of
16 wastewater treatment plants comply with state regulations. The water contamination has been
so severe in some cases as to result in five beaches being declared unsuitable for swimmers
(Quepos, Azul, Tarcoles, Portete, and Balneario municipal de Limon).143 Mounting unmanaged
solid waste has consequences for public health and the sustainability of the green model. In sum,
an emerging area of environmental sustainability is the brown agenda.

142

The GMA accounts for only four percent of the national territory but concentrates more than 60 percent of the
population and approximately 75 percent of the vehicle fleet. There are approximately 1.4 million cars in Costa Rica
for roughly 4.6 million people (INEC, 2011 Census).

The country is also highly exposed to natural hazards and faces significant challenges from
climate change. Costa Rica is one of the countries with the highest exposure to hazards, including
hydro-meteorological (floods, cyclones, and landslides) and geophysical (earthquakes and
volcanoes).144 It is the second most exposed country to multiple hazards based on land area, with
36.8 percent of the total area exposed to three or more natural hazards. It is estimated that 77.9
percent of the population and 80.1 percent of GDP are subject to high risk from multiple hazards.
While Costa Rica has been spared by major disasters in recent years, it is not immune to the
potential of a catastrophic event. Hurricane Thomas in 2010 caused damages estimated at US$292
million; Tropical Depression 12E in 2011 caused US$60 million in damages; and in 2012 the
Samara-Guanacaste earthquake generated US$100 million in damages to public buildings,
transport, health, education, and water and sanitation infrastructure. Furthermore, according to the
Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), some of the climate change projections for
Costa Rica indicate up to a 32 percent decrease in overall rainfall precipitation by 2050. Some
areas, especially in the North, have recently seen more frequent and prolonged drought periods.
Changes in storm regimes near the coast may further erode coastal morphology, disrupt fishing
areas and agricultural lands, and salinize water sources.145
Increasing urbanization and vulnerability of public infrastructure are two factors
contributing to risk exposure. The San Jose GMA’s fast-growing population puts pressure on the
limited natural resources and on public goods and services. Affordable housing is a major
socioeconomic constraint (see Chapter 3) that forces many low-income families to relocate to
higher-risk areas. In fact, most of the people affected by disasters such as floods live in informal
urban settlements.146 On the public infrastructure side, low levels of investment in disaster risk
reduction are putting critical transport infrastructure at risk of failure in the event of a disaster. An

illustrative example is the need to replace and retrofit the bridges most crucial for transport and
most vulnerable to seismic and hydro-meteorological events. Of all the damages due to hydrometeorological events between 2005 and 2010, 51.6 percent were recorded in the transport sector.
Strengthening prevention and resilience is complicated by low capacity of local governments.
Even though national policies for Disaster Risk Management (DRM) exist at the national level, a
major constraint in the process of generating more knowledge and increasing preparation is the
level of local technical capacity to absorb information and implement the right measures. 147 For
example, the capabilities to use and process information vary widely across municipalities: only a
few have the right human and infrastructure resources, such as sophisticated mapping systems. As
a result, overall resilience and adaptation to climate-induced impacts has yet to be achieved at local
levels.
Sustaining and promoting a Green Trademark needs to extend beyond forest conservation
and reforestation. The “green” asset that Costa Rica has established with its forests can be
maintained only through an integrated approach that enables the conservation of natural resources
to be developed in parallel to other productive activities and balances the many financial and
environmental trade-offs. This has been achieved in other countries, such as New Zealand and
Finland, where the “green” image is supported with strong forestry and agricultural sectors and a
risk preparedness framework. However, the challenge in Costa Rica will be to find the right
balance, if any, between “green” and carbon neutral while addressing increasing issues in the
brown agenda in the country.

Despite Costa Rica’s good standing on governance relative to the LAC region, both
perceptions and evidence suggest that its institutions and procedures have not been able to
adapt to the challenges of a new economic and social environment. Costa Rica has better
governance indicators than LAC, but lags behind OECD countries (Figure 5.25). After the 1948
civil war, the abolition of the army, and the creation of the new Constitution in 1949, Costa Rica
became an exemplary democracy, with a clear checks and balances system between the executive
and the legislative (Assembly). Since 1953, elections have been peaceful and citizen participation
in the political process is high (Chapter 1). Costa Rica also has high marks in the areas of voice
and accountability and control of corruption. The areas of government effectiveness and regulatory
quality are the ones trailing behind, with the largest difference with OECD countries.

147

GFDRR (2011) and World Bank (2013c).
Governance is broadly defined as “the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised”
(Kaufmann, Kraay, & Mastruzzi, 2010) or “a government's ability to make and enforce rules, and to deliver services”
(Fukuyama, 2013). Numerous studies across a wide set of countries point to good governance being beneficial for
growth, investment, and finance, and bad governance leading to detrimental effects on economic outcomes.

The current political landscape poses additional challenges for approving and implementing
needed reforms. Costa Rica’s legislative power has gradually shifted from a bi-partisan to a multiparty system, hampering the adoption of reforms in many instances over the past decade(s) (Figure
5.26). Parliamentary procedures, which historically did not impede decision making, give political
minorities the power to delay votes or to file injunctions, which, in a fragmented and polarized
environment, seems to be hampering reform processes.149 One example is the fiscal reform
package that was approved by the Legislative Assembly, and later invalidated by the Constitutional
Court following an injunction filed by a legislator. The leadership, in drafting new legislation, has
also shifted slightly from the executive to the legislative, partly a reflection of parliamentary
procedures. For example, during the Chinchilla administration (2010–2014), most of the new
legislation passed originated in the Arias administration (2006–2010). Paradoxically, the
Chinchilla government experienced the most difficulty in passing comprehensive reforms in the
Assembly during its first two years, when the political capital would seemingly be the highest. 150
During the second half of the term, the “wear and tear” of parliamentary negotiations manifested
itself, and the magnitude of the new legislation passed also diminished. The delays and difficulty
in passing comprehensive and meaningful reforms result in a mismatch between the “political
delivery” and the demands of the population. Finally, in the absence of clear political leadership
and consensus, new interpretations of the existing laws take the place of passing new laws.

Cornick and Trejos (2009) highlight the problematic features of the rules and procedures of Costa Rica’s legislature
in more detail: “A two-thirds quorum is required not only when votes are cast but even during debate: written
discussion and submissions for the record are not allowed. Bills must be voted on once in committee and then twice
by the full Congress. Questions concerning a law’s constitutionality are referred to the courts between the first and the
second vote; a minority of members may even send the bill to the courts before the first vote. Every member may
propose an unlimited number of amendments to a bill and is allocated a certain amount of time to argue for each
proposal. Each motion to amend is debated and voted on separately, may be raised and re-raised in committee, and
then raised and re-raised again before the full house” (p. 165).
150
This is also true for other administrations.

A consequence of this gridlock in passing reforms has been the proliferation of an increasing
number of public (and often autonomous) institutions created to address specific problems.
Costa Rica is notorious in Latin America for the large number of public institutions. In 2011, the
state comprised 324 entities (Table 5.1), followed by El Salvador with only 162. Many of these
institutions were born out of a desire to make the government apparatus more efficient and agile—
typically through the creation of “autonomous institutions,” which are run under different
regulations from the Central Government and have a separate budget process (more on this below).
Also, these institutions usually have much more generous pay scales than the Central Government,
but the same level of job security, and no real performance evaluation mechanisms. In the last two
decades, more public entities were created than in the entire period 1950–1979. Between 1990 and
2009, 118 were founded or restructured. Over time, these new bodies are affecting the
government’s efficiency (and service delivery), thus reinforcing the vicious cycle that leads to the
creation of new institutions. In some cases, some institutional clusters have been effective in
achieving positive outcomes (for example, the attraction of FDI and tourism development
discussed earlier); but in others there are failures, too, the most salient one being the case of the
rice sector (Box 5.1). With 28 institutions, the agricultural sector provides an example of the
fragmentation of institutions that hinders the coordination and effectiveness of policies, decisionmaking, and quality of services for producers.151 As long as public sector action is needed to
provide services to foster growth, modernizing the public sector becomes a needed foundation that
will impact all aspects of the economy.

programs, projects, or services provided (p. 337).

Box 5.1: The rice sector: failure of a productive development policy
Rice, a staple item in the food basket of the poor, is one of the most protected commodities in Costa Rica.
Rice tariffs in Costa Rica are high, at 62 percent for processed rice (having recently increased from 35
percent), and prices for locally produced rice are controlled at each step of the process. Rice subsidies (in
the form of guaranteed prices), amount to 45 percent of the domestic price, higher than in the United States
or the European Union (EU). Ironically, the policies that protect rice prices under a banner of food security
and equity have brought them well above international prices, benefiting a handful of large producers and
harming the budget of the poor.
The Corporación Arrocera Nacional (CONARROZ), created in 2002, has been effective in protecting producers
from international price shocks, but not in improving local production conditions. CONARROZ gathers a very
diverse set of rice producers and processors, most of them very small producers. Its lobbying efforts are
presented as a way of defending these small producers and protecting jobs in the agricultural sector.
However, most of the rice produced in Costa Rica (about 80 percent) comes from a minority of large
producers and processors, who also benefit from tariff-free import quotas (assigned proportionally to their
processing capacity). Thus, they can purchase rice at international market prices, and sell the processed rice
domestically with a high profit. It is estimated that from 1995 to 2005, consumers transferred US$396
million to rice producers, which for the poorest households represents seven to eight percent of their per
capita income.
Price controls have done little to improve productivity among rice producers but have created incentives to
maintain the status quo. Although consumer prices have continuously increased since 2008, producer prices
have remained flat or decreased, mostly due to low quality. The average yield per hectare has gone down
from 4.8 tons in 1999/2000 to 3.39 tons in 2011/2012. As a result, most domestic rice producers,
particularly the smaller ones, would not be profitable at international prices, and thus have a strong interest
to maintain the status quo.

Besides the proliferation of institutions, current procurement practices are not conducive to
an effective control of resources. Current public procurement practices fail to consolidate
purchases (taking advantage of framework agreements, for example) or standard bidding
documents, both of which could lead to important cost savings. Also, neither the public sector
entity nor the government makes good use of existing information technology to plan, manage, or
control procurement. In many cases, precise purchasing statistics are not available and there are
95

only weak links between procurement plans, the budget process, and various aspects of the
financial management at the budget execution stage. In addition, within this overall legal and
oversight framework, each public sector entity is free to set its procurement rules and procedures,
making it difficult to do centralized planning or to consolidate purchases across institutions. This
absence of complete statistics on procurement and procurement methods makes it difficult to
identify patterns, learn from mistakes, carry out performance evaluation, and design efficient
procurement policies.
Box 5.2: The CCSS lacks an integrated management system over resources
In terms of budget, the Costa Rican Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) is the
largest decentralized autonomous entity in the Government. Its annual budget of about US$5.6 billion for
2015 is equivalent to 37 percent of the Central Government Budget.
The CCSS’ operational processes are characterized by complex and cumbersome procedures. They rely on a
“silo” approach that favors fragmentation and duplication of many processes paired with multiple layers of
approvals. Moreover, the fragmentation of

The preparation of financial statements provides a
good example of the challenges that CCSS faces to
adequately monitor the use of its resources. Information from over 20 IT systems and databases is manually
collected and aggregated Because these systems and databases are not linked, the CCSS has developed
burdensome and manual reconciliations across the organization, as well as additional manual controls, in
order to ensure that errors are prevented or detected in a timely manner. The lack of an integrated IT
platform does not allow the timely and systematic recording of financial and accounting transactions. While
these manual and compensating controls allow for the timely preparation of budgetary reports and financial
statements (including budget monitoring, reconciliations of accounts, analyses of fluctuations, aging of
accounts, and manual and supervisory reviews), given the nature of the CCSS more meaningful financial
information—such as financial information by service delivery units or by cost centers—might be needed to
support decision-making and monitoring financial performance.

Another complexity of the intricate public sector administration is the budget and planning
system. The current budget system limits the ability to have a comprehensive discussion on policy
and spending priorities.152 Costa Rica has three distinct budgetary processes in the public sector.
First, the central government budget or national budget, which is approved by the legislative
assembly. Second, the budgetary process of the institutions outside the central government, whose
budget is approved by the Comptroller General of the Republic (CGR), and which doubles the size
of the national budget. Of the total public sector budget, the national budget is about 33 percent,
and the budget of other institutions is 66 percent.153 The third budget process is for municipality
152

Estado de la Nacion (2014).

96

budgets, which account for less than two percent of public sector expenditures. The CGR verifies
the legality of proposed expenditures by the municipalities. Thus, a large part of public
expenditures is not under the direct control of the executive or the legislative powers.154 The latest
PEFA assessment (World Bank and IDB 2010), found that only 49.6 percent of expenditures were
approved by the Congress and in 2011 the central government accounted for only 41 percent of
expenditures and 27 out of a total of 229 entities.155
The budget process and numerous earmarked expenditures reduce the margin for the
executive to control public investment and current expenses. Budgets are increasingly
constrained by constitutional mandates and rules without corresponding financing, such as
directives on minimum spending for education, municipalities, housing subsidies, and community
development. Additional laws stipulate that portions of taxes and fees must be allocated to certain
activities and institutions, such as FODESAF (National Development and Family Allocations
Fund) and CONAVI (National Roads Authority). Pensions, wages, and salaries account for threequarters of central government expenditures. Public sector employment is much higher in Costa
Rica than in most other Latin American countries, comprising 14.4 percent of the labor force in
2012 compared to an average of 10.9 percent (Figure 5.27). Public sector wages are also
significantly higher than the private sector ones (see Chapter 5, Figure 5.5). Moreover, the central
government tax revenue is still insufficient to fund all these legal and constitutional mandates. A
World Bank Public Expenditure Review finds that “in order not to exceed spending limits and
given these rigidities, the government has often resorted to cutting back on public investment,
putting pressure on service delivery. One of the most evident results of public investments
restrictions is the deterioration in the quality of most of Costa Rica’s infrastructure services.”156
More important, the executive has no power to direct or contain spending in autonomous
institutions, since they operate with wide margins of budgetary and administrative independence,
and are constitutionally protected from political interference or changes in government.

Moreover, sectorial planning is weak with limited medium-term costing projections. Annual
work plans are developed at the institution level despite a provision made in Law 8131 to develop
multi-annual plans at the sectorial level (multi-institutional). The PEFA (ID-11 iii) shows a very
weak environment for sectorial planning. More analysis will be needed to fully understand the
consequences of weak sectorial planning coupled with increased number of institutions (including
special purpose institutions, executive agencies) on service delivery, but clearly a fragmented
planning system is not conducive to improving the quality of public expenditures.
The main effect of weaknesses in public sector administration is on the diminished ability of
the public sector to deliver services expected by the population and private sector. Agencies
affected are those in charge of education, health, public infrastructure, and social assistance, which
have a direct effect on the inclusiveness of growth. Not surprising, there is a growing perception
of low effectiveness of government institutions and civil servants. According to a 2011
Latinobarómetro study, Costa Rica was rated by its own citizens at 5.5 out of 10 on the efficiency
of the government and 5 out of 10 on the efficiency of civil servants. This perception was worse
among people in the lower deciles than in the top deciles. The Latinobarómetro study also reports
that, when asked about “what the government has done for you in the past 12 months,” citizens
responded that government was doing a relatively good job for middle class and upper middle
class but not so much for the poorer groups (Figure 5.28).

Knowledge gap 5.3: What are the key governance bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects—
and what are their cost implications?
Various factors are named as obstacles to implementation of public infrastructure and social projects in the
various line ministries, such as cumbersome processes in the Public Procurement Law, deficiencies in the
environmental regulatory framework, cumbersome checks and reviews by the Contraloria, and deficiencies
in the expropriations law. Further evidence on the trajectory of investment projects—and the time delays
and costs of each step along the way—would help inform the debate about how to reduce the “chokes and
strangleholds” on public investment in Costa Rica.

In sum, we find that the public sector has moved very slowly to adapt to the increasing
sophistication and needs of the economy.

99

Costa Rica’s development model has sustained impressive achievements. Centered on its longstanding democracy, ambitious Social Compact, open economy model, and Green Trademark, the
country has sustained healthy growth rates, improvements in social indicators, environmental
gains, and one of the lowest poverty rates in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region.
However, despite these impressive achievements, there are a number of emerging challenges
that will need to be addressed to maintain the country’s successful development path.
First, despite reasonable growth and a strong commitment to the Social Compact, poverty
reduction has stagnated and inequality is rising. The long-term trend suggests rising or
stagnating inequality across most of the past 25 years, in stark contrast to the significant decline in
inequality in the broader LAC region. More recently, the gap between the rich and poor has
widened significantly since the global crisis. Although growth recovered promptly after the global
crisis, above the regional average, job creation for low-skilled workers has been feeble,
contributing to rising unemployment and pushing returns to higher education upwards. Growth
has been uneven, with lower growth and job creation in sectors that are more likely to employ
unskilled workers (e.g., construction and agriculture). Not surprisingly, inequality has increased,
with the widening gap between the earnings of rich and poor workers mirroring large disparities
in human capital and educational attainment. Moreover, despite high spending on social protection
benefits and the broader Social Compact, taxes and transfers have not proven to be effective in
redistributing income to compensate for these disparities. Consequently, rising inequality offset
the poverty-reducing impact of growth in the late 2000s, and reversed what should have been a
decline in poverty between 2010 and 2014, with poverty increasing by 0.4 percentage points
instead of falling by a projected three percentage points during the post-crisis “recovery” period.
Second, although GDP has grown steadily in recent years, especially compared to the Latin
American Region as a whole, Costa Rica performance is not comparable to the top regional
performers. Unlike the top regional performers (Chile, Panama, and Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per
capita GDP had not shown any signs of convergence towards the US level in the last 25 years. For
example, in 1990, Costa Rica per capita income was 13 percent of the US level, approximately as
it is today. At the same time, the per capita GDP of Chile, Panama, and Uruguay have increased
form 13, 12 and 9 percent of the US per capita GDP in 1990 to 21, 17 and 17 percent today
respectively. Production costs that weaken the country’s competitiveness prevent Costa Rica from
joining the top growth performers. These productions costs are affected by relatively high wages
that limit the country competitiveness in low value added sectors, as well as by a number of
investment-climate related factors such as rising electricity costs, weak infrastructure, and
burdensome regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to undermine the sustainability of the country’s Social
Compact and Green Trademark, and prevent it from undertaking much needed investments
in public infrastructure. Without fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push public debt to
unsustainable levels and threaten the country’s economic, social, and environmental gains. The
100

fiscal situation has deteriorated substantially since the global crisis, with the overall deficit of the
Central Government growing to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and is projected to have surpassed
six percent in 2014 and to reach 6.6 in 2015. In tandem, public debt increased from 25 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 37 percent in 2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019 unless corrective
measures are implemented. This recent deterioration stems from counter-cyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces that will require actions on multiple fronts.
Moreover, the current political landscape and institutional framework add an additional
layer of complexity for approving and implementing key reforms needed to address these
emerging challenges. The shift from a two-party to a multi-party system in the last fifteen years
has resulted in more complex and lengthy reform processes. The delays and difficulties in passing
comprehensive and meaningful reforms, particularly on sensitive issues such as tax reform, has
resulted in a mismatch between the demands of the population and the “political delivery”. This is
an increasing concern given the growing need to react and adapt quickly to changing global
developments. Likewise, capacity constraints, related to weak sectoral planning and bureaucratic
inefficiencies, also affect the ability of the public sector to implement policies and execute public
investment projects.
Several threads weave across this “trilogy” of challenges for inclusion, growth, and
sustainability—and point to priority areas for action. One thread involves the interactions
between inequality and growth, which hinge on the mismatch of skills and jobs. Another strand is
the dual challenge of maintaining competitiveness of high value-added sectors, while enhancing
the viability of traditional low value-added sectors. Mounting fiscal pressures threaten the
sustainability of the Social Compact and Green Trademark. Finally, the challenges of governance
also weave across the development agenda, limiting the capacity of the public sector to adopt
reforms, deliver services, and execute infrastructure projects. These inter-connected challenges
highlight a number of priority areas that Costa Rica needs to address to continue on a sustainable
and inclusive growth path.
These links highlight a number of complementary priority areas for Costa Rica to continue
on a sustainable and inclusive growth path. As in other countries, the list of policy areas that
could potentially help make progress toward poverty reduction and shared prosperity is long.
Through a combination of diagnostics, benchmarking, and internal and external consultations, this
Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) refines the long list to identify a set of cross-cutting areas
with strong linkages and complementarities. These include: strengthening the education and
training systems, boosting competitiveness and reducing the infrastructure deficit, strengthening
governance, and undertaking a variety of measures to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal
situation, the Social Compact, and the Green Trademark (Figure 6.1).

EDUCATION AND SKILLS. Costa Rica needs to build a skilled workforce to supports its
trajectory towards a high value-added economy and to reduce the skills-income gap. With
fewer than half of young adults graduating from secondary school, and with performance on test
scores falling, Costa Rica’s labor supply does not appear to be well adapted to generate the skills
needed for the labor market. Thus, building a more skilled workforce will ensure that the country
remains competitive in high value-added sectors, and that more workers can access these better
paying jobs, including those in the bottom 40 percent of the population. As these changes are
structural, for the most part they are also long term in nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an
education overnight.” As such, tackling these challenges will require a three-pronged approach: (i)
strengthening the quality, retention, and relevance of the education system (from pre-school
through secondary school)—which will help build the skills of “tomorrow’s workers”; (ii)
improving the quality and relevance of tertiary education; and (ii) strengthening the technical
training system for the workforce.

Bold actions are needed to overhaul Costa Rica’s education system. Given the country’s level
of development and high education spending, the education system seriously underperforms in
quality (as demonstrated by test results), retention (low completion rates), and relevance (as
indicated by low returns to training and lower levels of education). Although high rates of
secondary school dropout are a symptom of the broader challenges in the system, imbalances in
the allocation of public spending favor primary (41 percent) and tertiary education (32 percent)
with relatively little allocated to the secondary level (27 percent). Indeed, both the share of public
spending and the allocation per student in secondary education are low by international standards
and given Costa Rica’s level of development. Moreover, inequities in learning outcomes start early
in life—and affect motivation and abilities to learn throughout the school years. In addition to
rebalancing spending towards secondary school and early childhood development, Costa Rica
102

needs to strengthen teacher quality and improve accountability through regular monitoring with
standardized learning assessments, and a more effective governance and incentive framework.
Given the high-skilled profile of job opportunities in Costa Rica, systemic efforts are also
needed to enhance the quality and relevance of tertiary education. Currently, the tertiary
education system is heavily biased towards social science and humanities, and produces few
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates, further contributing to the
skills shortage in high value-added sectors. Moreover, outdated and bureaucratic procedures for
recognizing foreign degrees create obstacles for Costa Rica to “import” the skills needed to sustain
its high value-added growth model. Quality and accountability mechanisms are also needed, with
performance agreements with public universities and quality accreditation standards for both
university and non-university tertiary education
Finally, the country needs to expand the offering and relevance of technical training, which
is the most direct way to build the skills of the current workforce. Again, stronger quality
standards, certification of technical programs, and accountability of training institutes could help.
The National Learning Institute (INA) could also improve coordination with private-sector
employers to design market-relevant curricula and course offerings so as to better respond to the
needs of the growing sectors of the economy.
COMPETITIVENESS AND THE BUSINESS CLIMATE. Boosting growth and inclusion in the labor
market requires confronting the dual challenge of maintaining competitiveness of high valueadded sectors, while improving the viability of low value-added sectors. For instance,
improving the integration of export-oriented and domestic firms through backward linkages could
sustain the growth among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), generating jobs in mid- and lowskilled occupations. This can be done by lowering operation costs to improve the productivity of
labor and counterbalance the high labor costs in Costa Rica compared to its neighbors, for example
by lowering the costs of doing business through regulatory simplification.
INFRASTRUCTURE. Reducing the infrastructure deficit would increase competitiveness,
growth, and environmental sustainability. Costa Rica’s historical efforts to build an extensive
network of infrastructure in nearly all productive service areas (water, sanitation, transport,
electricity, and telecommunications) are clear from the infrastructure stock: the country has two
times the road and three times the rail density of the average middle-income country; access to
electricity is nearly universal; and mobile penetration is higher than the OECD average. Yet, the
near freeze in public infrastructure investment until the 1990s, as well as recent fiscal constraints,
have taken a toll on the country’s ability to upgrade and maintain its infrastructure. Further, the
government has faced significant challenges in executing infrastructure investment in a timely
manner. As a result, today roads and ports have among the lowest quality marks in the LAC region.
Electricity prices have doubled since 2007 due to weather related variable hydroelectric output,
causing increased use of thermal units and high operating costs, among other factors. This
infrastructure deficit reduces the potential of local firms to grow and create jobs, and this is true in
particular for firms that operate outside Free Trade Zones (FTZs). In addition, the country needs
to improve its waste management and clean energy production capabilities to be able to reduce
GHG emissions, and water and soil pollution. Infrastructure improvement poses a number of
tradeoffs, including the need to intervene in protected areas (in the case of clean energy
production), as well as the need to control the current fiscal deficit. Given the necessity of

103

continuing to invest in infrastructure, and the reality of fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must look for
options for private sector participation in the maintenance and upgrading of its infrastructure.
Both growth and inclusion would benefit from the many complementarities involved in
improving education, competitiveness, and infrastructure. A well-educated workforce with
relevant skills is fundamental for sustaining economic growth and increasing productivity. In
parallel, closing the education gap between the poor and non-poor is also highly relevant for
inclusion by providing opportunities those in the bottom 40 percent. Lowering the costs of doing
business will boost competitiveness across various sectors. Furthermore, increasing infrastructure
spending would stimulate construction, thereby creating more jobs for the large stock of lowskilled workers.
At the same time, actions are needed to ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s development
model:


FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY: Improving the fiscal stance to restore sustainability requires
reforms to manage expenditures and increase revenues. On the expenditure front, these
include containing the wage bill of the consolidated public sector, as public sector wages, both
in government and more so in state-owned enterprises and other public institutions, are well
above the private sector at all employment categories; and reviewing the fiscal sustainability
of the pension system, particularly of special pension regimes in the public sector. In addition,
a comprehensive reform of the budgetary process is needed to increase efficiency and
transparency in all public sector entities. Finally, curtailing the earmarking of revenues, which
cover more than half of primary spending, would make the budgetary process more flexible.
Comprehensive reforms are also needed to increase revenues. For example, the 1,259 tax
exemptions approved since 1953 that comprise almost six percent of GDP need to be
thoroughly reviewed. Curtailing those exemptions would make the tax system more rational
and progressive, as well as produce higher revenues. This reform is essential for restoring
sustainability to the fiscal accounts, which is a necessary condition for achieving Costa Rica’s
economic and social objectives.



SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY: In addition to strengthening education, priority areas for sustaining
the Social Compact including health and social protection. Costa Rica needs to modernize its
universal health system to improve quality by: (i) strengthening the health care model to
enhance capacity to adapt to demographic and epidemiological change while ensuring quality
and timeliness of service delivery; (ii) improving the financial model of budget and resource
allocation; and (iii) improving the management model for the health system for accountability,
efficiency, and performance. The country also needs to increase the effectiveness of social
protection programs by (i) harmonizing eligibility criteria and social information systems; (ii)
improving performance monitoring and evaluation; and (ii) reducing institutional and program
fragmentation.



ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY: To sustain its celebrated “Green Trademark,” Costa Rica
needs to balance environmental and natural resource management goals, by: (i) reviewing the
sustainability of the PES mechanism for conservation; (ii) modernizing water and solid waste
treatment (infrastructure, service delivery, regulatory framework, capacity); (iii) increasing the
supply of renewable energy by making regulations on the use of protected areas more flexible;

104

(iv) implementing a comprehensive transport policy, including measures to reduce growth of
demand for energy associated with transport; (v) reinforcing regulation and oversight of agrochemical use and incentivizing the expansion of “green” (organic) agriculture; and (vi)
improving territorial planning, land management, and management of natural and man-made
disasters.
GOVERNANCE. Progress in all the priority areas discussed above hinges on improving the
capacity of the public sector to plan and implement policies, execute public investment
projects, deliver services, and increase accountability. Despite Costa Rica’s good governance
levels compared to the rest of the LAC region, there is a growing perception of low effectiveness
of government institutions. Cumbersome regulations, in many cases resulting from lack of
coordination among institutions, make the process of starting and running a business—particularly
a non-FTZ small or medium enterprise—more challenging. Low levels of transparency and
accountability lower the efficiency of public spending. The current political landscape, where
political minorities have the power to delay votes, further reduces the margin for approving and
implementing needed reforms. The need to improve governance is apparent in all priority areas,
for instance by increasing accountability in the education sector (e.g., by tracking student
achievement to reward teacher and school performance). Employment creation would benefit from
streamlining business regulations as well as the public procurement and investment processes to
improve infrastructure. A more consolidated budget, fewer tax exemptions, and more control over
spending by autonomous institutions could greatly help to reduce the current fiscal deficit, and
would improve the capacity to monitor results of public spending. In turn, results-based
management would help to boost the efficiency of public spending, for example, enforcing the use
of common information systems and modernizing the M&E frameworks in the social sectors.
AN AGENDA FOR KNOWLEDGE. Finally, a number of knowledge gaps need to be filled to inform
better policy decisions. Although there is a large and productive research and policy analysis
community studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues where having further research and data
collection would provide more information to help design more concrete policy reforms to tackle
the issues presented above. For example, the specific factors driving secondary dropout are still
not well understood. In the labor market, it is not clear whether the contraction of employment in
agriculture, manufacturing and construction is of a cyclical or structural nature, and this has
important implications for low-skilled unemployment. Likewise, although there are strong signs
that reservation wages are high, there could be more studies to quantify this phenomenon better.
To improve the efficiency of the public sector, it is crucial to identify the specific governance
bottlenecks in executing infrastructure projects, as well as their cost implications. Also, the
articulation mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of social programs need to be based on a
thorough institutional mapping of social programs. Finally, environmental conservation needs to
be better linked with economic activity, and a key knowledge gap in this regard is how to link
sustainable production and rural landscapes to conservation.

The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) core team followed a highly inclusive process in the
development of the final product and the elaboration of the diagnostics. In this appendix, the
collaborative steps followed towards the preparation of the draft document are detailed.

March 2014—Initial Country Team brainstorming: The initial task team organized a half-day
country team meeting to discuss the guidelines for SCD and to consult on an initial power-point
on key challenges for adequate growth, inclusive growth, and sustainable growth.
April 21, 2014—Concept Note Review Meeting: The review meeting took place with a concept
note that laid out the rationale, objectives, and approach for the task, as well as the work plan going
forward. Some background papers were commissioned after the concept note review.
August/September 2014—Formulation of hypotheses: The SCD preparation process started
with the formulation of a set of 10 general hypotheses around key areas for Costa Rica’s growth
and poverty reduction patterns based on the review of the literature. The country team and key
specialists in specific areas provided feedback and comments on their validity as well as additional
information to substantiate, refine, or change these hypotheses, or to dismiss them.
September/October 2014—Brainstorming sessions: the SCD team held two broad
brainstorming sessions in which the participants discussed: (i) the revised hypotheses and proposed
means of analyzing the knowledge gaps; and (ii) a draft of the overall SCD storyline that translated
the hypotheses into a full structure around growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability following the
SCD guidelines.
October/November 2014—Bilateral consultations: Several rounds of bilateral consultations
with sectorial teams were held to focus on the remaining knowledge gaps that could be filled prior
to the elaboration of the overall storyline.
December 2014—Quality Enhancement Review: Chaired by the Latin American and Caribbean
(LAC) Chief Economist, the Quality Enhancement Review allowed the SCD team to received
feedback on the storyline from peer reviewers.
February 2015—Prioritization workshop: A facilitated workshop with the broad Costa Rica
Team was held with the objective of soliciting inputs on identified priority areas for growth,
inclusion, and sustainability. Key constraints and solution areas were identified for each priority
area. The discussion revolved around how to simplify the list of priority areas and which priorities
were considered but discarded. At the end, there was consensus on the cross-cutting nature of the
proposed priority areas, and some of them could be combined to provide a better entry point with
the government counterparts.
106

March 2015—Regional Operation Committee Decision Meeting: Chaired by the LAC Vice
President, the Decision Meeting provided further feedback and guidance to the team.

The SCD preparation was accompanied by a consultation process in Costa Rica to ensure that key
stakeholders provided inputs into the deliberations and shared early findings. A preparation
mission was conducted during September 22–26, in which the SCD team participated in the
“Encerrona” event organized with the counterparts in Costa Rica to discuss the World Bank
engagement. The SCD team held meetings with counterparts in Costa Rica from the government,
private sector, academia, and think tanks to get their views on the poverty and inequality trends,
as well as on the growth pattern of Costa Rica. Two more consultation missions were carried out
in November 2014 and January 2015.

107

To benchmark Costa Rica’s performance,
this report uses six comparable groups of
peers: Central American countries, Latin
American peers, upper-middle-income
countries, the average for the World,
structural peers, and aspirational peers.
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) countries are
used as “aspirational peers” given Costa
Rica’s ongoing accession talks to the OECD.
The structural peers were selected using the
“Find your friends” tool.
The group of structural peers includes
countries
that
provide
appropriate
benchmarks for answering SCD-relevant
questions such as whether or not certain
conditions,
policies,
or
economic
performances in Costa Rica are adequate.
The criteria and filters for selection were the
following: (i) GDP per capita between
US$5,500 and US$15,500, as Costa Rica is
an upper-middle-income country; (ii)
population between 2.5 million and 20
million people; (iii) CO2 emissions: Costa
Rica is one of the most environmentally
sustainable countries in the world, andnly
countries with less than 5 CO2 metric tons
emissions (the world average) per capita
were included in the selection process; (iv)
geography, which often determines
comparative advantage and in some cases
historical similarities;

landlocked economies and small island states
were excluded, while several Central American
countries were included; and (v) only non-fragile
states were selected. The use of these criteria
resulted in the following set of countries: Chile,
Croatia, Dominican Republic, Lithuania,
Panama, and Uruguay.
