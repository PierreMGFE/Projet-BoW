1. Understanding Guatemala’s
Development Challenges
Overview
Guatemala has enormous potential to
generate prosperity for its population. The
country is strategically located, has substantial
natural resources, and a young multi-ethnic
population that could foster growth and shared
prosperity. Considered the “gateway” into the
Mesoamerican market, Guatemala has ports on
both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (and a
proposed dry port with Mexico) providing
connectivity to external markets, thus making it
an attractive destination for foreign direct
investment. The country’s complex topography,
with coastal plains in the southeast, central
highlands, and northern lowlands, provides a
range of climatic zones that encompass rich
biodiversity and economic potential for agriculture, forestry, and hydropower generation.
Guatemala has become a leading exporter of
agricultural products and is the fourth largest
exporter of sugar in the world and the largest
exporter of cardamom.1 Large mineral deposits
of gold, nickel, lead, zinc, and iron, among others,
add to Guatemala’s wealth of natural resources.
And with a young and growing population,
especially among indigenous people, Guatemala
is in the early stages of a demographic transition
that has the potential to yield a demographic
dividend. The country has a population of over
15 million people, of whom half live in urban
areas. Ethnic-cultural diversity makes Guatemala
distinct, with 42 percent of the population
belonging to an indigenous group, the highest
share in the Latin America region. At the same
time, almost 40 percent of the population is

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

younger than 14, and the median age is 21.2
years, the lowest in the Latin American region.2
In some ways, Guatemala has lived up to its
potential. The emergence of (“Guate-Latinas”),
Guatemalan companies whose revenues, operations, and resources originate from overseas, is
one example of the dynamic process of globalization.3 Guatemalan entrepreneurs have expanded
internationally in an effort to diversify their local
exposure. Most of this expansion has been in
search of new markets in neighboring countries
(Southern Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador)
rather than to participate in global value chains.4
Guate-Latinas operate in a range of different
industries, such as regional food producers, food
franchises, regional commercial real estate
developers, regional banks, and integrated sugar
and ethanol producers. Another example of
Guatemala’s economic dynamism is the emergence of information technology firms, including
call centers and companies specializing in digital
special effects for movies. Although large firms in
the private sector are benefitting from these
developments, this is not the case for the private
sector as a whole and its large number of micro,
small, and medium-sized enterprises.
Guatemala has one of the highest poverty rates
in Latin America. The poverty rate (according to
the US$4 per day poverty line) increased from 55
percent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2014. This
implies that the number of Guatemalans living
below the poverty line increased from 6.8 million
to 9.6 million people during those 15 years. This
trend is in striking contrast with the significant
overall decline in poverty in both Latin America
as a whole and most of Central America. The lack

1

of income growth among the bottom 40 percent
of the population in Guatemala between 2000
and 2014 is also in direct contrast with most
Latin American countries.5 Non-monetary
indicators of welfare also highlight the extent to
which Guatemala is an outlier in the region.
Chronic malnutrition (stunting) remains at levels
seen only in countries with substantially lower
income levels. Guatemala ranked 127 out of 133
countries on stunting in 2008, almost the exact
same ranking as it had in 1990.6 Education levels
are also low, with only 18 percent of all 25 to 29
year olds having graduated from secondary
school, half the Central American average and a
quarter of the OECD average.
Tremendous and persistent inequalities can be
found in Guatemala across ethnic groups,
locations, and economic sectors. The Gini
coefficient of income, a common measure to
assess income inequality, was 0.49 in 2014. This is
well below previous levels but still ranked at the
top end of world inequality. Nor is inequality
limited to income. Land concentration in
Guatemala is among the highest in Latin
America: the Gini coefficient for land in
Guatemala is 0.84. In 2014, the combined wealth
of Guatemalan millionaires amounted to 65
percent of GDP.
In a sense, one needs to visualize two
Guatemalas with large gaps in outcomes between
them to understand the country’s challenges. One
Guatemala is rural and the other urban, one is
indigenous and the other non-indigenous, one
informal and the other formal, and one lacks
access to basic services while the other has the
ability to pay for those services when the state
does not provide them. The gaps between the two
Guatemalas are large. The indigenous peoples of
Guatemala are 1.7 times as likely to be poor as
non-indigenous peoples, while at the same time
they are poorer than indigenous peoples in most
other Latin American countries. Chronic
2

malnutrition (stunting) is high throughout the
country (affecting 47 percent of all children) but
the figure is 66 percent among children in the
lowest welfare quintile and 61 percent among
indigenous children.7 This is much higher than
malnutrition rates among indigenous children in
El Salvador (40 percent), Peru-Quechua (15.4
percent), India (25.3 percent), and Brazil (25.7
percent).8 The differences in stunting rates among
wealth quintiles are large, ranging from 17
percent in the top quintile to 66 percent in the
lowest. In education the gaps are also large: rural
inhabitants have, on average, only 3.7 years of
schooling compared to 6.2 years in urban areas.
In 2006, the gap in sixth-grade reading test scores
between the poor and the middle class was the
largest in the Latin American region.
The gaps between the two Guatemalas are also
clear in economic terms. Nationally, economic
activities are carried out by a small formal sector
with social protection (18 percent of workers) on
the one hand and, on the other hand, by a large
informal sector (82 percent of workers). The
share of workers who are not covered by social
security in Guatemala is among the highest in
Latin America and the Caribbean. In two of the
largest sectors, agriculture and commerce, 94
percent and 86 percent of employment, respectively, is informal. After controlling for workers’
endowments, earnings in the informal sector are
almost 60 percent lower than those in the formal
sector. The large informal sector is a symptom of
a lack of opportunities, and contributes to the
low productivity of the economy as a whole.
Agriculture, a sector of particular significance to
the economy, has a dualistic structure with
export-oriented large farms on the one hand and
subsistence-oriented small farms on the other. At
one extreme, Guatemala has become a leading
exporter of agricultural products such as sugar
and cardamom and has the most efficient
sugar-loading terminal in the world.9 At the other
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

extreme, small farmers produce for the domestic
market and for their own consumption, and their
productivity is declining or stagnant.
This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD)
looks at why a country with such great potential
has not been able to materialize it. The SCD
analyzes four fundamental questions to first
understand the factors behind Guatemala’s poor
development outcomes, to then reflect on the
causes that have led to the current situation, and,
finally, to propose pragmatic options to move
Guatemala to a higher development stage.

it from being more inclusive?

changes have the greatest potential to reduce
poverty and foster shared prosperity?

Why is Poverty So High
and Persistent?
The high levels of poverty in Guatemala are
a function of social exclusion, low growth, and
challenges to the sustainability of growth.

Low Inclusion
Labor markets have played only a limited role in
improving household welfare in Guatemala. The
number of jobs has increased at the same pace as
GDP, which has helped to reduce poverty, but the
quality of these jobs has not improved. Earnings
are stagnant, especially in the sectors in which

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

the poor are most likely to work. The poor tend
to lack human capital as a result of their limited
access to basic services such as education and
health, and this negatively affects their ability to
find the types of productive employment that
would help them to rise out of poverty. Coverage
of basic and other services is far from universal in
Guatemala, and poor households and ethnic
minorities continue to bear the brunt of unequal
opportunities and poor outcomes. The low levels
of revenues collected by the national government
limits its ability to provide public services. At the
same time the net result of the existing fiscal
policy (direct and indirect taxes and transfers) is
to actually increase poverty and does nothing to
lower inequality.
There is very little socioeconomic mobility in
Guatemala. Intra-generational mobility is low:
the share of households that remained poor
between 2000 and 2014 was 37 percent, which is
about 50 percent higher than the average for the
Latin America region. In net terms, about one in
ten households rose out of poverty during that
period, but more than that fell into poverty. Not
only are the kind of developmental and educational opportunities for children that could
enable them to rise out of poverty in adulthood
unequally distributed, but also the returns to
education in the labor market are unequal. For
example, returns to endowments for indigenous
groups tend to be lower than those for other
groups. This exacerbates the disadvantages
associated with having only limited opportunities. In short, people are excluded from the
benefits of economic growth through both a lack
of endowments and a differential rate of return
on those endowments. The middle class is small
(constituting less than 10 percent of Guatemalan
population), which is a reflection of the considerable barriers faced by people trying to rise out of
poverty.

Low Growth
Aggregate indicators of economic development
suggest that, rather than catching up with richer
countries, Guatemala has diverged from them.
Guatemala’s per capita GDP is now 6.7 percent of
the per capita GDP of the United States whereas
the equivalent figure in 1960 was 8.4 percent.
During the same period, other Latin American
and Caribbean countries were able to increase
their incomes relative to the United States from
12.2 percent to 18.1 percent on average. In
Central America, Guatemala’s performance in
terms of converging with the United States has
been similar to that of Honduras, El Salvador,
and Nicaragua, neighboring countries that share
Guatemala’s development challenges. In contrast,
Panama and Costa Rica, like most Latin
American countries, have made headway in
converging with the United States. Today,
Guatemala is the fifth poorest economy in terms
of per capita GDP in the Latin American region,
a drop of five positions from its rank in 1960.
Guatemala’s ability to maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework, which is one of its
most recognized achievements, has not translated
into high growth or poverty reduction. The
Central Bank has been successful in keeping the
inflation rate low and stable. Moreover, manageable fiscal deficits (of around 2.1 percent since
2000) have kept Guatemala’s debt level to below
25 percent of GDP. Fiscal discipline has been
achieved despite Guatemala having one of the
lowest tax burdens in the world (about 10.8
percent of GDP in 2014). On the external front,
the current account balance has decreased over
the past decade, reaching 2.3 percent of GDP in
2014, much lower than the level in the early
2000s (5.6 percent). The government’s trade
policies have led to a more open foreign investment regime, flexible foreign exchange arrangements, and the deregulation and the

4

liberalization of the financial, power, and
telecommunication sectors in the mid-1990s.
Nevertheless, economic growth has been modest,
averaging only 3.4 percent between 2000 and
2015, and per capita growth has been weak. Nor
have labor markets been able to generate sufficient good quality jobs. Despite pockets of
dynamism created by the private sector, labor
income has played a limited role in reducing
poverty, which suggests that the private sector is
constrained in its ability to generate quality jobs
for a largely unskilled labor force. In contrast
with the internationally competitive portions of
the economy, almost two-thirds of workers
operate in the informal economy, and 84 percent
of workers lack social security coverage.

Social, Fiscal, and Environmental
Sustainability
A range of factors threaten the sustainability of
efforts to reduce poverty and increase growth in
Guatemala. Guatemala is among the top ten
countries in the world most affected by extreme
climate events and is not exempt from geophysical hazards. Its geographic location makes it
prone to frequent and high-intensity geological
and weather-related shocks such as storms,
hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes, and volcanic
eruptions. Moreover, climate change is already
affecting the growing cycles of its key subsistence
crops, which are beans and corn, and the negative
effects of climate change disproportionately fall
upon poor households. Guatemala’s high levels of
crime and violence also negatively affect households and businesses by raising the cost of doing
business.
Given Guatemala’s frequent natural disasters
and its high levels of crime and violence, the
absence of a strong safety net exacerbates
households’ vulnerability. The government’s low
fiscal revenues limit its ability to mitigate the

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

effects of exogenous shocks and to create a
sustainable development path for the country.
Guatemala has a low tax-to-GDP ratio and a high
share of indirect taxes. As early as 1950,
Guatemala had the lowest tax revenue as a
percentage of GDP (6.67 percent) in Central
America, a ranking that continues today.10 Social
spending in Guatemala, despite recent increases,
is well below the Central American average. The
fact that 2.8 million additional people fell into
poverty between 2000 and 2014 (and more than
half of these into extreme poverty) suggests that
the government is unable to provide an adequate
safety net for its population.
The final challenge to Guatemala’s future
growth and prosperity is that, as a relatively
young democracy, it is still building the key
pillars of democratic government, such as
representation, justice, and equity. Guatemalans
have the lowest trust in democracy (33 percent)
of all populations in Latin America according to
the Latinobarómetro.11 Moreover, voter participation in elections in Guatemala is the lowest in
Latin America at 56.3 percent in 2015, despite
having increased from 36.9 percent in 1995.12 The
political landscape, with its fragmented and
short-lived political parties, is not conducive for
approving and implementing the structural
reforms needed to reduce poverty and foster
inclusive growth. It will be necessary to build
consensus among all groups in Guatemala to
ensure that change is perceived as feasible.

The Legacy of the Past:
A Fragmented Social
Contract and Weak
Institutions
The persistence of low growth and high
poverty suggest that Guatemala is trapped in a

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

low development equilibrium. Guatemala’s
development has been hindered by two fundamental and interlinked features: (i) a fragmented
social contract, which is the implicit agreement
between the state and its citizens about their
respective roles and responsibilities; and (ii) weak
institutions. The economic and social dynamics
of colonial times and the development of an
economy based on large coffee plantations
resulted in a fragmented social contract and a
preference for a small state sector on the part of
the populations of both Guatemalas. This, in
turn, created weak public institutions that have
not been able to provide the necessary levels and
quality of public services, thus creating unequal
opportunities for individuals and firms. Change
has been minimal given how little accountability
there is within the government and how large
segments of the population have little say in
public affairs. The net result has been the two
Guatemalas that are evident today.
Today’s high levels of inequality and poverty
are rooted in history, a history that has resulted
in a fragmented social contract and that shaped
the early development of Guatemala’s institutions.13 The start of the coffee boom in the late
19th century triggered the enactment of discriminatory property right laws and massive land
expropriation from indigenous peoples along
with the privatization of their communal land.
Private entrepreneurs established large coffee
plantations, creating a skewed land distribution
pattern between indigenous peoples and the rest
of the population. To ensure the supply of labor
for coffee, which was a labor-intensive crop, the
government legalized the extreme labor repression of indigenous groups through the introduction of a forced labor system (mandamiento) in
1877, forced labor for building roads (1873), and
debt servitude.14 These forced labor laws continued to be in effect until the middle of the 20th
century. The 1934 Vagrancy Law, which forced
5

landless peasants to work at least 150 days per
year on plantations, was only rescinded in 1947
with the enactment of the first Labor Code.
Nevertheless, the practice of plantation owners
providing landless workers with subsistence plots
instead of cash wages in exchange for their labor
during the harvest season continues today.
Overall, the economic model of plantation
agriculture drove growth in the early years of the
state, but in the longer run, this model and the
labor legislation that it spawned created a weak
social contract that has hindered the construction of effective state institutions.
The ability of Guatemalans to change the
system from the inside has been limited due to
restrictions on voting. The 1879 Constitution
gave the vote to a very narrow segment of the
population: literate males with a specific level of
wealth and land. With illiteracy very high among
the indigenous population and wealth concentrated in few hands, the Constitution reinforced
the dualistic nature of the economic and social
system. Half a century later, suffrage was
extended to women, but the literacy requirement
remained. It was not until 1965 that universal
suffrage was voted into law and included in the
Constitution.
The high degree of ethno-linguistic diversity in
Guatemala and the absence of a strong social
contract have meant that state institutions are
weak.15 The ethno-linguistic diversity in
Guatemala is so extensive that it translates into a
high rating on the “fractionalization index” rating
(which measures the probability that a random
sample of two people within any given country
will contain members of different ethnic or
linguistic groups). Guatemala’s rating is 0.64, well
above the world average of 0.39.16 In highly
fragmented societies, individual preferences can
lead to the under-provision of public goods when
the public goods that benefit one group are
undervalued by members of other groups.17
6

Studies have shown that a high level of fractionalization in a country may limit the ability of state
institutions to provide public goods, both
generally and specifically. The types of public
goods that are provided also tend to be those for
which there is no private substitute, for example,
roads rather than schools and health care.18 In
addition to skewing the priorities for investment,
fractionalization can lead to inefficiencies in
public spending.19 Redistributive policies aimed
at promoting equity and growth are also rarely
adopted in countries with a high degree of
fractionalization.20 In short, Guatemala’s early
economic model and the limited voice and vote
of the population combined with its cultural and
linguistic diversity worked against the formation
of strong institutions. This has also perpetuated
inequality over time and undermined the ability
of the country to develop.
Historically, there have been few checks and
balances on the executive branch of government
that has further challenged the country’s ability
to build competent public institutions. A combination of the harsh labor laws designed to
guarantee a supply of labor for plantation
agriculture and the inequity of their application
increased the probability of labor rebellions
occurring. This had two results. First, elites in
one part of the country were unwilling to pay the
costs of quelling uprisings in other areas and thus
resisted government efforts to raise taxes. Second,
in order to allow the government to react
strongly to these costly uprisings, only weak
constraints were put on its executive functions by
the segment of the population with voting
rights.21 Only after the Peace Accords of 1996 did
the executive constraints on the Guatemalan
government become as strong as those in other
democracies (figure 1.1). To put this in context,
Costa Rica had a stronger system of checks and
balances in the late 19th century than Guatemala
has today. Moreover, Costa Rica was able to

improve its social outcomes more dramatically as
well. Between 1900 and 1930, Guatemala’s
literacy rate rose from 12 percent to only 19
percent, whereas Costa Rica increased its adult
literacy rate from 36 percent to 67 percent in the
same period.22 Checks on the executive function
were also inconsistent, jumping from almost nil
to being somewhat constrained in very short
periods of time. The combination of low funding
and low constraints on executive functions
further undermined the establishment of strong
and effective public institutions that could bridge
the gap between the two Guatemalas.
More recently, the 36-year civil war further
damaged Guatemala’s social contract.23 This
conflict between leftist insurgents and the
government and its military lasted from 1960 to
1996, Central America’s longest and most violent
civil war. It eroded Guatemala’s already weak
institutions and their ability to provide services
and other public goods and intensified social
divisions and inequality as the costs of the war
were borne largely by the rural and indigenous
populations. It is estimated that more than
200,000 people were killed, 83 percent of whom
were indigenous. At the same time, substantial
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

numbers of people were displaced internally and
internationally, many to refugee camps in Mexico
and others fleeing further north to the US. The
provision of services to rural and indigenous
areas was particularly curtailed. Although the
level of economic growth was maintained for a
while at the onset of the war, it fell during the
most violent phase of the conflict in the 1980s
(the same time when much of the displacement
of populations occurred), which further hampered service provision. Moreover, the war had
other serious short-term and long-term implications for Guatemala’s structurally fragile development, particularly in terms of the level and
composition of public spending, jobs lost, low
productivity, insufficient output, human capital
deterioration, and the disruption of life at the
village level.
The underlying dynamics between the two
Guatemalas are represented in figure 1.2. The
fragmented social contract means that the
populations of both Guatemalas tend to accept
the existence of a small and weak state sector. On
the one hand, those who do not benefit from
public spending have little incentive to pay taxes
or demand greater tax collection. On the other
7

hand, those who do benefit from public spending
are unwilling to pay taxes or to expand the state
apparatus to provide services to all. The low taxes
ensure that the small public sector does not have
the capacity to improve the management of
public investment, which, in turn, constrains the
provision and lowers the quality of public
services. Economic growth is limited because of
the limited capacity of the state to invest in the
infrastructure needed by the private sector and to
enforce the rule of law. Private households must
either do without services or pay out of pocket
for the services that should be provided by the
government such as security, education, and
health care. The history of weak constraints on
the executive has resulted in ineffective controls
on spending and on the inefficiencies and
corruption that arise in such conditions. The
inability of the state to provide services to large

groups of the population has led the voting
population to feel excluded and disaffected. The
net result has been considerable inequality of
outcomes between different segments of the
population starting in childhood and continuing
into adulthood and the perpetuation of the two
Guatemalas.
This duality and inequality exists in many
other countries too, but the divisions are particularly wide in Guatemala. The first difference
between Guatemala and other countries is simply
the scale of the exclusion. Only 10 percent of
Guatemalans are neither poor nor vulnerable to
falling into poverty. The middle class, defined as
the share of the population that lives on between
US$10 and US50 per day, shrunk from 13.2
percent in 2000 to 9.3 percent in 2014. In Latin
America as a whole during the same time period,
the size of the middle class actually increased,

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

leading to an ever-widening gap between
Guatemala and other countries in the region.
Only Haiti has a smaller middle class than
Guatemala. The limited size of the privileged
groups means not only that the country’s
resources are highly concentrated but that the tax
burden is highly concentrated too.
The second difference between Guatemala and
other countries is that those Guatemalans who
are not benefitting from growth are tremendously
heterogeneous. Of all people living in poverty in
the country, 52 percent are indigenous, in that
they belong to three main indigenous communities, the Mayan, the Xinca, and the Garifuna.
Within the Mayan group, there is also substantial
diversity, with a total of 21 languages being
spoken, of which the most common are Q’eqchi,
Kakchiquel, Mam, Tzutujil, and Achi. The
non-indigenous poor are not homogenous either.
Similar to the indigenous poor, the non-indigenous poor work in a variety of sectors and live
throughout the country in both urban and rural
areas. The lack of uniformity among the excluded
groups has made it more difficult for them to take
collective action to pressure the state into
providing adequate public goods and services.
A third factor that makes the two Guatemalas
story so relevant for this SCD is the geographic
concentration of investment and opportunities in
Guatemala City. In many countries, the gap
between urban and rural areas in terms of
economic development is substantial, and this is
certainly the case in Guatemala. Even more
important, however, are the gaps between the
metropolitan area (the capital city and its
environs) and the rest of the county. A 2010 study
of regional activity found that per capita GDP in
the Guatemala department was 7.3 times higher
than in the department with the lowest per capita
GDP (Huehuetenango). This is far higher than in,
for example, Bolivia (2014), Mexico (2010), and
Peru (2012) where the gap in per capita GDP
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

between the richest and poorest region is about
4.8, 6.1, and 6.3 times respectively. This shows
just how concentrated economic opportunities
are in Guatemala City. When Guatemala is
compared with other countries in the region that
have significant indigenous populations, the gap
between Guatemala City and its suburbs and the
rest of the country is particularly large.
Guatemala and Honduras have similar poverty
rates, but the geographic gap in Guatemala is 35
percentage points compared with only 22
percentage points in Honduras. And only
Honduras has a gap in years of schooling between
the metropolitan area and the rest of the country
that is larger than Guatemala’s.24 In summary, the
size and heterogeneity of the excluded groups in
Guatemala and the geographic concentration of
investment and opportunities makes it clear that
increasing growth and shared prosperity in
Guatemala will require interventions that are
systematic and on a large scale.

New Pressures on
Guatemala
In the absence of purposeful change, the
present low equilibrium of the economy and
society could become a downward spiral.25 New
challenges have arisen in Guatemala that are
creating new demands on the state and may
further erode stability: these are crime and
violence, demographic changes, the pressures of
urbanization, and migration.
High levels of crime and violence have
emerged in the past 15 years as threat to inclusive
development. Guatemala is one of the most
violent countries in the world: it ranks among the
five countries with the highest homicide rates in
the Latin American region.26 While the murder
rate declined from 46.4 homicides per 100,000
inhabitants in 2009 to 34 in 2013, this rate is still

9

higher than the average rate for all of Latin
America, which is around 25 per 100,000
inhabitants.27 In 2012 the homicide rate in
Guatemala City alone was almost three times
higher than the national homicide rate and was
the third highest in Latin America. About half of
all violent deaths in Guatemala take place in only
5 percent of the country’s municipalities. Other
regions with high homicides rates, such as Izabal,
Chiquimula, El Petén, Zacapa, and Jutiapa, are
located along the country’s borders with El
Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Belize. While
this is indicative of a likely link between violence
and transnational organized crime such as drug
trafficking, no studies have yet established this
causality. High levels of robbery and the
increased incidence of sexually related crimes,
kidnappings and violence-related injuries all
make citizens feel increasingly insecure.28 Crime
and violence are hampering Guatemala’s development by limiting the opportunities available to
individuals, by decreasing incentives for firms to
invest, create jobs, and expand, and by undermining the population’s good opinion of state
institutions and governance. Historically, crime
and violence has been ranked by firms as the
main obstacle to doing business in Guatemala.29
Demographic pressures will present Guatemala
with both opportunities and challenges in the
coming decades. Because Guatemala has a very
young population that is growing at the rapid rate
of 2.5 percent per year, its working-age population will continue to expand rapidly while its
dependent population will shrink in proportion
to the working age population. This demographic
transformation presents the Guatemalan government with a crucial window of opportunity for
implementing social and economic policies to
ensure that the young population can accumulate
the human capital needed to access higher-skilled
jobs. Conversely, these demographic changes will
also lead to growing demand for public services
10

and the need for better economic opportunities
in the future. The risk is that the state will be
unable to generate sufficient physical and human
capital to take advantage of the demographic
dividend. Failure to do so could turn the potential demographic dividend into a demographic
trap in which high fertility rates, widespread
poverty, and falling living standards reinforce
each other. For example, if Guatemala’s present
rates of poverty and population growth remain
unchanged, by 2030 there will be almost 5.1
additional million people living in poverty,
increasing the total number of the poor to 14
million out of a population of 22.5 million.
Rapid and unplanned urbanization will put
further pressures on Guatemala’s already strained
public services. Although only half of the
population currently lives in urban areas, the
urban population is projected to increase from
8.1 million to 21.1 million by 2050. The process
of urbanization will expand demand for basic
services such as security, transportation, water,
sanitation, and waste treatment facilities.
Increasing deforestation due to changes in land
use, agricultural practices, and illegal logging is
already having detrimental consequences for the
country’s watersheds and ecosystem. The lack of
territorial planning by the government is
exacerbating the negative impact of urbanization
on natural resources and on social cohesion.
Climate change may also increase the rate of
internal migration to cities by reducing the ability
of the rural poor to produce their own food.
There is evidence that recent temperature
increases attributable to climate change have
risen above the optimal range for important food
stables such as beans,30 and there is concern for
the future with regard to corn. The recent growth
in urban poverty suggests that the urbanization
process will not be easy.
Finally, emigration has long been an escape
valve for Guatemalans which has affected the
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

economy in several ways. This emigration has
been driven by a combination of civil war, natural
disasters, and the overall lack of economic
opportunities. Emigration from Guatemala
increased rapidly during the most violent years of
the civil war in the late 1970s, continued to grow
in the 1990s, and has been particularly high since
2012, driven by growing levels of crime and
violence. In 2014, approximately 8 percent of
Guatemalans were living outside of Guatemala,
and almost 90 percent of these were in the US.
Unlike Honduras and El Salvador, Guatemala
also has a tradition of circular migration to
Mexico, primarily for agricultural and domestic
work. Remittances sent home by these emigrants
is a significant resource for Guatemalan households. In 2015 remittances accounted for almost
10 percent of Guatemala’s GDP, lower than in
Honduras (17 percent) and El Salvador (16
percent) but still high (in 2013 Guatemala ranked
25th out of 186 countries worldwide).31 The share
of households receiving remittances has dropped
since before the global financial crisis, highlighting the risks of relying on remittances as a
strategy for reducing poverty. At the same time,
while migration has brought in much-needed
resources for households, there is some evidence
that remittances are having a Dutch disease effect
by raising reservation wages and putting pressure
on the exchange rate. These effects could undermine the competitiveness of Guatemalan
businesses and their fiscal balances.

Priorities
The analysis in this report shows that
Guatemala’s development challenges are
long-standing and complex. Long-term historical
processes have led to the present fragmented
social contract, small state, and weak institutions.
Change has been slow at best: the key findings
from a 1951 World Bank report still seem
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

relevant today (box 1.1). It is clear that, even with
the best intentions on the part of the government
and its development partners, making substantial
and sustainable improvements in welfare and
economic growth is going to be a long-term
effort. However, while the current situation
reflects a negative dynamic, it could be converted
into a positive one. Large groups of Guatemalans
have not benefitted as much from growth as they
might have been expected to do and have only
been able to make a limited contribution to the
country’s economic growth. Thus, bridging the
two Guatemalas would not only raise the
standard of living of these groups, thus reducing
poverty, but would also increase their potential to
make positive contributions to the economy.
The implications of figure 1.2 and of the
analysis undertaken in this SCD are threefold.
The first implication is that there is a need to
address many problems at once. A narrow focus
on specific change will have a very limited chance
of improving the situation because the underlying effects of Guatemala’s fragmented social
contract and weak institutions permeate all
sectors of the economy and all population
groups. Second, it will be necessary to identify
policies that will collectively create synergies and
that will multiply the effect of each separate
action. The country’s resource constraints and the
range and depth of need must be taken into
account when designing these policies. Third, it
will take more than incremental changes even in
multiple areas to move Guatemala onto a higher
development path. The nature of the self-reinforcing dynamic that exists in Guatemala is such
that a “big push” will be necessary to break the
country out of it.
Four fundamental criteria were used to
identify priority areas for action. First, given the
array of problems to be addressed in Guatemala,
it was necessary to start with those problems that
set Guatemala apart from its peers, areas in
11

which it is an outlier. Second, given the country’s
limited resources, which have declined even
during the period in which this report was being
written, the team decided that priority must be
given to actions that can remove multiple
bottlenecks and that will have a beneficial effect
on other problems and sectors, not just on the
immediate area of action. Third, given that
Guatemala’s poverty is deep (meaning that the
extremely poor are truly extremely poor), at least
some actions need to be taken to improve
people’s welfare immediately. Fourth, the team
gave a high priority to interventions that have the
potential to result in long-term, sustainable
change.

Inclusion Challenges – Towards a
More Inclusive Social Contract
Many segments of the population have few
opportunities to participate in the economy and
to contribute to Guatemala’s social and economic
development. While there has been progress in
some areas that have demonstrated the ability of
the government to effect change, there are still
significant gaps in terms of both opportunities
and outcomes between the two Guatemalas.
Concerns exist on many fronts, two of which the
analysis has shown to be of critical importance:
the high rates of chronic malnutrition (stunting)
and the continued education gap.
•

12

Malnutrition: The extent of malnutrition
along with its historic intractability and links
to other welfare outcomes makes solving
this problem a high priority. The direct costs
of malnutrition to individuals are high as it
leads to a greater risk of mortality, higher
morbidity, and lower cognitive development.
It can also perpetuate poverty across generations. The costs to the economy are also high
as malnutrition undermines investments in

•

public services and deprives the labor market
of productive workers.
Education: Low education levels affect
malnutrition through the low quality of jobs
and thus the low earnings that are available to households with little education as
well as through the lack of health care that
is provided to poor children. Investments
to increase the coverage and improve the
quality of education will be needed to boost
productivity in the economy and capture
the demographic dividend associated with
having a growing young population.

Challenges to and Opportunities
of the Growth Model
The SCD’s analysis of the trends and drivers of
growth in Guatemala has found that the country
faces long-standing challenges to its competitiveness, productivity, and the creation of high
quality jobs. Guatemala’s multi-cultural society
will need to be explicitly taken into account when
the two main challenges are addressed.
•

Low investment levels. Investment levels are
low in both the public and private sectors. In
the case of public investment, low fiscal revenue is the critical factor together with weak
implementation capacity in the institutions
involved in Guatemala’s investment climate.
Investment in the private sector is constrained by crime and violence, the non-enforcement of the laws related to contracts
and property rights, a lack of competition,
and the limited delivery of public services.
Public-private partnerships, if invested in the
right type of projects and paying attention
to fiscal risks, might be a way to promote
and attract private investment, but transparent and efficient procedures are essential to
effectively mobilize private sector finance

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

BOX 1.1 Guatemala’s Development Challenges in 1950
A 1950 World Bank report on Guatemala highlighted many features that are largely still relevant
today.
Untapped potential. The report argued that the country’s natural advantages, properly used “should
[have made] it possible for the Republic to achieve a relatively favorable position among the nations of
the Americas both in living standards and in financial stability. Yet actual economic development …
ha[d] barely scratched the surface of these latent possibilities.”
Low labor productivity. The report showed that Guatemala’s overall labor productivity was low,
especially in the agricultural sector.
Investment. An unfavorable investment climate and the under-provision of public goods were found
to have led to low private investment. The report highlighted the fact that under-investment was not
only due to a lack of resources: the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP in 1950 was in US accounts held by
Guatemalans.
Lack of adequate transport infrastructure. The report considered that the topography of Guatemala
kept isolated “large segments of the rural population…. and potentially productive markets.” It felt that
the “inadequacy of transport facilities probably constitute[d] the greatest single barrier to ... economic development.”
Lack of coordination of public policies. The report highlighted the duplication and competition
among agencies that existed in the absence of any mechanism for deciding among them. This was seen
to endanger development.
Insufficient and inequitable social spending. Social spending was deemed to be insufficient and
concentrated in Guatemala City. In the case of health, for example, “public health expenditure at 2.1
percent of the budget [was] much lower than in other Latin American countries, like Panama (12.4
percent), Costa Rica (3.5 percent), or Chile (7 percent).” Within Guatemala, the report called attention to the large ethnic disparities in terms of health, education, nutrition, and income.
Financial needs and new revenues. The report raised the issue of the need to increase revenues to
finance critical investment. “Deficiencies in tax administration, small tax base, and low rate” were
identified as the main areas that needed reform.
Ethnic inequalities. Finally, the report highlighted the need to increase the productivity of the
indigenous peoples for the country to achieve long term development. “In the long term, to promote
development in Guatemala, it is indispensable that the productivity of the indigenous population be
raised so as to provide them with purchasing power over and above their subsistence needs. This will
require measures aimed at improving their education, health, and nutrition. Moreover, to integrate the
population into a single economy and improve standards of living, jobs must move towards sectors
with higher productivity.”

and expertise.
Low agricultural productivity. A sustainable
growth strategy in agriculture must involve
enhancing the productivity of smallholders
and fostering opportunities for farmers to
adopt high-value-added production. Continued support will be needed for the formation
and consolidation of organizations of small
farmers, mainly those involving indigenous
peoples, to develop economies of scale, increase productivity, and support the diversification of production. Boosting agricultural
productivity is, of course, integrally linked to
resolving land issues.
•

Fiscal, Social, and Environmental
Challenges
Increased fiscal resources will be needed if the
government is to be able to deliver the basic
public goods and services that the population
needs. However, it will be difficult to increase
revenues unless the public sector becomes more
transparent. Land has been a contentious issue in
Guatemala for a long time, which puts a strain on
social cohesion and public and private investment. And the vulnerability of the country to
natural disasters continues to set back development efforts and to hinder economic growth.
•

14

Domestic resource mobilization. Low domestic revenues have been a recurrent constraint
to Guatemala’s development by limiting the
government’s ability to use public spending
as a policy tool. Guatemala’s tax revenues
as a percentage of GDP are far below the
regional average, in part because of the small
size of the formal economy and in part to
the fragmented social contract. Adding to
these constraints, the government has little
discretionary income to spend as about 88
percent of its fiscal revenues are pre-commit-

•

ted.32 Moreover, the effectiveness of public
spending is hampered by the weaknesses of
institutions. Improving targeting and making
more efficient use of existing resources
can mitigate, in a small way, the revenue
shortfalls, but the absence of a broader tax
base and compliance with existing tax laws
will continue to prevent Guatemala from
increasing sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Without more resources, the
institutional weaknesses and lack of service
delivery in all sectors cannot be rectified
as efficiency gains will never be enough to
resolve these issues.
Social monitoring. There is a need to increase
pluralism in constructive ways. Until recently, Guatemalans have been characterized as
disinterested in public issues or as reluctant
to express dissent due to the Civil War, in
which over 200,000 people were killed. As
recently as 2015, 52 percent of the population indicated their belief that freedom of
speech was not well protected in Guatemala.33 However, Guatemalans have increasingly been demanding a more transparent
and accountable government. In particular,
young people who did not live through
the conflict have felt empowered to take a
stand. The public protests of the past year in
reaction to the La Línea scandal34 were organized mainly through social media and were
instrumental in forcing the resignation of
the Vice President and several ministers. So
the situation is ripe for the creation of a new
social consensus about the roles and responsibilities of the government in relation to the
population. Transparency will be essential
for the sustainability of this social consensus,
which will require tools of social monitoring of government policies, spending, and
actions through citizen participation.
Land titling and territorial planning. Land

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

•

has been a difficult issue in Guatemala’s
history. The very high concentration of land
ownership (which has a Gini coefficient of
84 percent, well above that for either income
or consumption) is a source of economic
and social stress in Guatemala where 50
percent of the population lives in rural areas.
Another problem is that the lack of territorial planning by the government undermines
the country’s environmental sustainability.
Therefore, it will be essential to resolve these
issues in order to foster economic growth,
improve social welfare, and protect the
environment. Land is the major productive
asset of many Guatemalan households, but
those who have no legal tenure over the
land on which they live have little incentive
to invest in its productivity. For the indigenous peoples, land plays an important role
in their cosmovision so their lack of tenure
and control over ancestral lands often creates
social unrest.
Environmental risks. Guatemala is in the
top 10 countries most affected by extreme
climate events and is not exempt from geophysical hazards. The geographic location of
the country makes it prone to frequent and
high-intensity geological and weather-related
shocks such as storms, hurricanes, droughts,
earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Moreover, the impact of climate change disproportionately affects poor households.

Knowledge and Data
Gaps
The SCD analysis has identified several
knowledge gaps. It is hoped that further work can
be done to collect and/or analyze data to fill these
knowledge gaps in the near future. While not an
exhaustive list, the key gaps are:

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

•

Lack of an up-to-date census. Carrying out
any analysis, either in macro terms (for
example, on per capita GDP) or in social
terms (for example, on poverty rates or even
ethnicity), requires accurate figures on the
number of people in the country and their
characteristics. Population and Housing
Censuses are typically carried out every 10
years in most countries, but Guatemala’s last
Census is 14 years old. The new government
is beginning to plan for a new Census. Once
those data are available, it may be advisable
to update and revise the analysis in this
report.
Malnutrition. What new information is
needed to shed light on malnutrition levels
and their intractability? One question is
whether there has been any change in the
synergies among the main dimensions that
affect nutrition-- health, care, environment,
and food-- over time.35 Analyzing the data
from the 2014 ENSMI when they are available should provide answers to this question.
A second question relates to the role played
by aflatoxin contamination of corn in malnutrition. Collecting new data (by re-visiting
households visited in previous surveys) and
collecting data on food sources could be a
cost-effective way to answer this question.
Primary school enrollments. After reaching
near universal enrollment in primary school,
rates have fallen in recent years. What are
the key factors driving this recent decline in
primary school enrollments? What role does
pre-school attendance play in the decline
(and why has this fallen as well?). Has the
demand for child labor risen or are migration and the worsening security situation the
key factors?
Infrastructure financing. What are the institutional factors hindering infrastructure financing in Guatemala? How can public-pri15

•

•

•

vate partnerships (PPP) help to increase the
funding for infrastructure improvements in
Guatemala?
Fiscal issues and effectiveness of public
expenditure. Without additional revenues,
Guatemala will not have enough resources
to finance its development needs. How can
the government improve its tax collection
system and revise its fiscal policy to make
public expenditure become more effective in
reducing inequalities and increasing security
in Guatemala?
Urbanization and Intermediate Cities. Ensuring an orderly and gradual process of urbanization could help to create “competitive
cities” and better employment opportunities
for the population by ensuring effective
transport systems, the efficient provision of
social services and minimizing the environmental damages. What strategy could the
government pursue to create a network of
inter-connected intermediate cities to foster
private sector development?
Bridging the gap between the formal and informal sectors. Informality is pervasive in the
Guatemalan economy, and this is detrimental to poverty reduction, productivity, and
tax collection. What are the determinants of
such extensive informality in the Guatemalan economy?

Structure of the Report
The analysis in this report focuses on the
2000 to 2014 period, covering the boom years
before 2008 and the global financial crisis and
recovery years up to 2014. It is based on a rich
household data set from the National Living
Standards Measurement Survey (ENCOVI) as
well as on data on malnutrition from the 2014
National Survey of Maternal and Child Indicators
(ENSMI). Where relevant and where there are
16

available data, longer times series have been
constructed, but the focus of the report is on this
15-year period. The analysis has some limitations. For example, there are only three years of
data on poverty: 2000, 2006, and 2014. Thus, it
was possible to study the macroeconomic impact
of the crisis and the recovery period but not the
microeconomic or household-level impact. The
SCD team identified various countries that could
be considered to be Guatemala’s peer and
aspirational countries in terms of their income
level and population size, and whenever it is
relevant to do so, the report benchmarks
Guatemala’s performance against the performance of those countries.36
The report is organized as follows. After the
overview presented here in Chapter 1, Chapter 2
provides evidence of the trends in poverty, shared
prosperity, and inequality in Guatemala. The first
section benchmarks Guatemala’s progress in
reducing income poverty against its peer
countries. This is followed by an examination of
consumption poverty, which is the official
measure of poverty used in Guatemala. The
analysis highlights the gaps between the two
Guatemalas. The chapter ends with some findings
concerning the drivers of poverty, specifically
focusing on the roles played by prices, labor, and
transfers. Chapter 3 attempts to answer the
question of how inclusive economic growth has
been in Guatemala, looking first at the limited
role played by labor markets in helping people to
rise out of poverty and at the limited human
capital and the dearth of opportunities to
increase it. The chapter then discusses the
ineffective and inadequate public spending that
drives these outcomes and demonstrates the link
between limited opportunities and poor
outcomes, focusing specifically on malnutrition
and vulnerability. Chapter 4 analyzes the drivers
of growth and the roles and characteristics of key
sectors. Important changes in trade policies are
Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

then covered, and the chapter ends with a
detailed discussion of the main constraints to
increasing investment and productivity and to
creating high-quality jobs. Chapter 5 focuses on
various fiscal, environmental, and social
challenges. Major concerns about tax revenues,

water resources and land use are highlighted. The
final chapter summarizes the priorities that have
emerged from the analysis and describes a set of
policies or areas of action that have the potential
to put Guatemala on a path of higher and more
inclusive growth.

27 There is no conclusive argument regarding the causes of
the decline in homicide rates in Guatemala. However,
the Government of Guatemala claims that various crime
control measures, including the deployment of task forces
involving joint military and police actions to areas with
high concentration of crime, has helped to reduce violence associated with competition among criminal gangs
over territory, particularly in poor urban neighborhoods.

As will be discussed in Chapter 4, per capita GDP
growth has been low (averaging 1.2 percent over the 2000
to 2014 period) but positive. However, household survey
data show no real growth. Such discrepancies between
surveys and national account data are not unusual,
and, in this case, the discrepancy is fairly small. The
differences may be due to measurement errors in either
the national accounts or the household surveys. A further
reason for the discrepancy may be related to the population figures being used as these are projections based on a
14-year old census.

Understanding Guatemala’s Development Challenges

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014
Poverty rates in Guatemala are among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean and in recent
years have been increasing. The middle class is small and shrinking. Inequality has declined but more
due to falling incomes at the higher end of the distribution than to growth among the poorest. There is
strong evidence pointing to the existence of “two Guatemalas” with the divide being seen along
geographic, ethnic, human capital, and even demographic lines. The poor are concentrated in rural
areas and among indigenous groups and have low human capital and poor outcomes. Labor income
does not drive poverty reduction, and public social policies have had only a limited effect on poverty.

There has been a sharp increase in income
poverty in Guatemala in recent years. This is of
particular concern given that such a rising trend
has not been seen in neighboring countries nor
among Guatemala’s economic peers.1 Combined
with its previous high levels of poverty, the recent
increase in poverty makes Guatemala the second
poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean: only post-earthquake Haiti is poorer (figure
2.1). The poverty headcount —measured with an
internationally comparable poverty line of US$4
per day per capita—increased from 55 percent
in 2006 to 60 percent in 2014. Extreme poverty
—defined internationally as per capita income
under US$2.5 per day— followed a similar trend,
rising from 33 to 37 percent between 2006 and
2014. (figure 2.2).2 While poverty trends over
the last quarter of a century have shown some
decline, the change is both small—with overall
poverty falling at an annualized rate of only about
half a percent per year—and well below that in

percent per year since 2006. The impact of the
change in trend is not trivial: if the annualized
rate of poverty reduction between 1989 and
2006 had been maintained through 2014, overall
poverty would have been 47 percent and extreme
poverty 29 percent. In human terms, 2 million
fewer people would have been poor in 2014 and
1.4 million fewer would have been extremely
poor. Guatemala’s extreme poverty rate of 37 percent is very high, one and a half times the Latin
American and the Caribbean average (24 percent). Its overall poverty rate is surpassed only
by that of Haiti (87 percent) in Latin America
and by Senegal (89 percent) among its structural
peers (figure 2.3). Not only is its poverty rate high
but the poverty trend has been in the opposite
direction of the trends in LAC and in both its
structural and aspirational peers. While there was
a 17 percentage point decline in poverty in LAC
between 2000 and 2012, Guatemala’s poverty rate
increased. At the same time, the gap between
Guatemala and its structural and aspirational
peers has also grown.

Although Guatemala has improved some
non-monetary measures of welfare (in education
and health), it still lags behind its peers (table
2.1). In the 1960s, Guatemala’s non-monetary
measures of welfare were quite low compared to
other countries. Between 1960 and 2013, the
country has made substantial progress on many
of these indicators, with the rate of progress
being similar to those of other peer countries.
Primary and secondary school net enrollment
rates grew dramatically, increasing by 76 and 488
percent respectively over the period. Both of
these rates of change were higher than those in
LAC, Central America, and in Guatemala’s
comparator countries. However, as Guatemala
started at much lower levels, it continues to lag
behind. Secondary enrollment is almost 10
percentage points lower than the Central
American average and almost half the LAC and
peer average. The infant mortality rate is almost
twice the Central American and LAC average
and three times that of its aspirational peers.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014

BOX 2.1 Measurement and Data Issues in Guatemala
Actual Population Size
The population figures used in this report and in official statistics are projections, not actuals. The last
Population and Housing Census dates from 2002 so some caution is needed when looking at per
capita figures. It is expected that birth and death rates will have changed in the 14 years since the last
census: certainly there is evidence of changes in migration patterns. Obviously, any errors in the
population projections could affect the analysis of per capita GDP, and, if there are variations in the
growth of different population groups, this could affect poverty measures as well, although there is no
data to indicate that this particular problem exists.
Poverty Measurement
The data for the poverty measures come from the National Living Standards Measurement Study
surveys (Encuesta Nacional de Condiciones de Vida or ENCOVI) for 2000, 2006, and 2014. There are
also data for a 2011 round of the survey but there are some methodological concerns about these data
in terms of comparability. The government is currently reviewing this issue and since this review may
lead to revisions of the 2011 indicators, we have chosen to use only data from the 2000, 2006, and 2014
survey rounds in the present report.
Guatemala uses a consumption-based monetary measure of poverty. This per capita measure covers:
(i) the consumption of purchased and non-purchased food (own production, gifts, and donations); (ii)
transport and communications; (iii) consumer goods; (iv) household services and legal costs; (v)
utilities, education, and health; and (vi) the annual use value of housing and durable goods. The
poverty lines used reflect the costs of a minimum level of calories (extreme poverty line) and the cost
of obtaining both food and other basic necessities (overall poverty line). We use this official measure
of welfare throughout the report.
However, the exception is when the focus of the analysis is on benchmarking Guatemala’s situation in
comparison with other countries (as is in done in this chapter). In such cases, we use an income-based
measure of poverty and an international overall poverty line of US$4 and an international extreme
poverty line of US$2.5 per person per day in 2005 PPP terms. While there has been an update to the
2011 PPP for the US$1.25 line, there are no updates for the US$2.5 and US$4 lines. For this reason,
the report continues to use the 2005 PPP and the global extreme poverty line of US$1.25 in 2005 PPP.
Urban and Rural Definitions
A new urban/rural classification was introduced in the 2002 Census by Guatemala’s National Statistics
Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE). The share of the urban population increased from
38.6 percent in 2000 to 48.1 percent in 2006. However, only 2.9 percentage points of this increase were
due to migration and population growth; the remaining 6.6 percentage point increase was due to
changes in the urban/rural classification (World Bank, 2009). This dramatic increase in the share of
urban areas in the sample explains why extreme poverty decreased between 2000 and 2006, even
Box continues next page

Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014

21

BOX 1.1 continued
though both urban and rural extreme poverty increased.
The more recent evolution of poverty between 2006 and 2014 has not been affected by changes in the
urban/rural classification.
When the rural-urban definition is important for our analysis, the discussion will be restricted to
changes between 2006 and 2014 only.

KNOWLEDGE GAP 2.1
The lack of a recent census creates uncertainty about actual population figures. In a country like
Guatemala with such high fertility rates, constantly shifting migration patterns, and changes in
mortality rates, it is crucial to have up-to-date census data. Therefore, a new round of the
Population and Housing Census is urgently needed.

Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014

Only by making faster progress on all indicators
will Guatemala be able to catch up to its peers.

Shared Prosperity: Income
Growth among the Bottom 40
Percent
There was little evidence of shared prosperity
in Guatemala in the 2000 to 2014 period. As
measured by average growth in the incomes of
the bottom 40 percent of the population, shared
prosperity was negligible in Guatemala between
2006 and 2014 in contrast with most Latin
American countries (figure 2.4). Guatemala and
Honduras are the only countries in LAC that
have experienced negative income growth in the
last few years. Over the full 2000 to 2014 period,
the poorest 40 percent of Guatemala’s population
experienced a decline in income, though this
decline was much smaller than the decline experienced by the whole population. The data show
FIGURE 2.4 Income Growth in Guatemala was
Negative while in Other LAC Countries it Rose

that the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of the
population are much less volatile than those of
the overall population, neither growing in good
years nor declining as much in bad years (figure
2.5).3

Inequality
Inequality in Guatemala is high, but has fallen
much faster than in either Central America or
Latin America as a whole (figure 2.6). As
measured by the Gini coefficient, inequality of
income in Guatemala was 49 percent in 2014,
higher than in most LAC and CA countries, all
aspirational peers, and all structural peers except
for Honduras (figure 2.7). Guatemala’s inequality
ranked in the 91st percentile worldwide (WDI,
2015). However, while there was no appreciable
change between 2000 and 2006, the next eight
years saw a very substantial decline in the Gini,
which fell from 0.55 to 0.49 percent. This sharp

fall in inequality occurred in both urban and
rural areas, with urban inequality falling from
0.55 to 0.48 and rural inequality falling from 0.50
to 0.46.4 As already discussed, these reductions in
income inequality have mainly been due to a fall
in the incomes of the rich rather than to a rise in
the incomes of the poor.5 And despite this
convergence in the income distribution, the total
share of income held by those in the bottom
deciles remains extremely low. The richest 1
percent of the income distribution controls 13
percent of total income. The middle class, here
defined as having incomes of US$10 to US$50 in
2005 PPP terms, have 26 percent of total income,
while the poor, or the bottom 60 percent of the
population, have only 26 percent between them
(figure 2.8).
The trends in Guatemala’s welfare indicators
diverge from those of other Latin American and
even Central American countries. At 9 percent,
Guatemala has the second lowest proportion of

middle class population in LAC, only surpassed
by Haiti at 4 percent. In LAC as a whole there has
been a dramatic rise in the size of the middle
class, from 21 to 35 percent of the population,
and poverty (as measured by US$2.50 a day) has
been halved. In Central America, these changes
have been less sharp, but poverty has still fallen.
Guatemala has deviated from this regional trend:
its poverty rate has risen and the share of the
population considered to be middle class fell
from 13 to 9 percent between 2000 and 2014
(figure 2.9).

24

Economic Mobility
Guatemalans have limited economic mobility.
The country has been less able to translate its,
admittedly low, economic growth into welfare
improvements than other countries in Latin
America. The significant gains in mobility seen
in most countries in LAC in the 2000s have not

been matched in Guatemala. While about one
in ten households rose out of poverty between
2003 and 2014, a slightly larger number fell into
poverty (figure 2.10). Compared with the rest of
Central America and LAC in general, Guatemala’s gross changes in poverty have been limited
(see Annex 2.1). The share of households that
have risen out of poverty in Guatemala is lower
that the shares for Guatemala’s regional peers.
Also, twice as many non-poor households fell
into poverty in Guatemala as in LAC as a whole
and slightly more than in the rest of Central
America.6 Within Guatemala, chronic poverty
was highest in rural areas and varied strongly by
ethnicity. The Mam experienced the highest level
of chronic poverty with two-thirds of households
remaining in poverty. While having the lowest
level of chronic poverty, the Q’eqchi experienced
the highest rate of new poverty with 18 percent
of their households having fallen into poverty
between 2000 and 2014. The non-indigenous

population had both the lowest levels of chronic poverty and the highest share of households
who were not poor in both periods. This analysis
does not address the degree to which churning
(movements into and out of poverty) may have
occurred over the 15 year period, which limits
the extent to which it can be used to understand
mobility. There is a need for panel data to be collected in Guatemala to allow for a more in-depth
analysis of intra-generational mobility.
Poverty at the municipal level has changed
more than the net poverty figures would suggest.
There is evidence of convergence among municipalities in rural areas (no data exist for urban
areas7), with the poorest municipalities showing
greater gains in poverty reduction than those
with lower poverty rates in 2000 (figure 2.11).
There were clear winners and losers, with
annualized changes in poverty at the municipal
level ranging from a decrease of more than 4
percent to an increase of over 3 percent. Of those

municipalities that had poverty rates above 75
percent in 2000 (defined as chronically poor
municipalities), those that remained poor as of
2011 started with higher levels of poverty,
averaging 91 percent poverty rates compared to
85 percent in those municipalities whose poverty
rates had improved somewhat. Chronically poor
municipalities were more likely to be located in
remote areas far from departmental capitals and
Guatemala City and to have a lower than average
road density. Not surprisingly, people in chronically poor municipalities also had less access to
basic services. Finally, those municipalities with
large indigenous populations, those with lower
labor force participation, and those that were
most vulnerable to weather shocks had less
economic mobility.

Official Poverty Levels and
Trends (Consumption-Based
Measure)
The official national measures of poverty reveal
the same trends as found using the internationally comparable income measure (figure
2.12). The official consumption-based measure
using the national poverty line shows overall
monetary poverty in Guatemala falling between
1989 and 2006 but then rising by 2014. (See box
2.1 for how poverty is measured in Guatemala.)
The changes in consumption poverty between
2000 and 2014, both positive and negative, were
greater than for income poverty. Extreme poverty

The Geographic Divide
There are clear geographic patterns of poverty in
Guatemala (figure 2.13). The areas of the country with the lowest levels of poverty are in the
corridor that stretches from the Pacific port of
Puerto Quetzal, crosses through the Metropolitan
region, and ends at the Atlantic port of Puerto
Barrios. The differences at the department level
are enormous: in 2014 for both overall and extreme poverty there was close to a 50-percentage

grew at a faster rate than overall poverty when
measured using consumption. At 16 percent in
2000, the extreme poverty level in Guatemala
was comparable to the rest of Central America.8
However, by 2014, extreme poverty had risen to
23 percent suggesting that significant numbers
of people had consumption very close to the national extreme poverty line. The growth in both
overall poverty and extreme poverty in Guatemala was also accompanied by increases in both the
poverty gap and poverty severity for both overall
and extreme poverty. In short, not only were
more people living in extreme poverty in 2014
than in 2006, but these people, on average, were
poorer in monetary terms than they had been
eight years earlier.
The gaps between the poor and the non-poor
in Guatemala are large. In general terms, the poor
are more likely to be informally employed, live in
rural areas in specific departments, belong to an
indigenous group, and have very low levels of
education. This is not uncommon; many other
countries could also describe the differences
between poor and non-poor in a similar fashion.
In Guatemala, the key issue is the size of the gap
and, as is discussed in the following section, how
difficult it has been to narrow these gaps because
of the limited socioeconomic mobility in
Guatemala. There is also a new twist in that
urban poverty is becoming a new concern.

point difference between the poverty rate in the
poorest and the least poor departments. In 2014,
Alta Verapaz was the poorest department, with
an overall poverty rate of 83 percent (and an extreme poverty rate of 54 percent). In contrast, the
department of Guatemala had an overall rate of
33 percent, and only 5 percent of its population
lived in extreme poverty. The geographic gap has
closed somewhat in terms of overall poverty, but
the opposite is true for extreme poverty where
both the absolute gap between the richest and
poorest department and the variance between
departments rose between 2006 and 2014.
Poverty is highest in rural areas, but there has
been a striking increase in urban poverty. In
2006, rural poverty was more than two times the
level of urban poverty overall (71 percent
compared to 30 percent) and for extreme poverty,
the ratio was 4.6 to 1. (See box 2.1 on why the
2000 urban and rural data are not comparable
with later years.) Both rural and urban poverty
had risen by 2014, and rural poverty remained

much higher than in urban areas. The depth and
severity of poverty levels are also worse in rural
areas, although there has been some convergence
in the second half of the decade as these indicators declined in rural areas while remaining
unchanged in urban areas.9 However, the increase
in urban poverty between 2006 and 2014 was
much greater (41 percent) than in rural areas (8
percent). This does not appear to have been due
to rural-urban migration: a Huppi-Ravaillion
decomposition shows that it has been the poverty
increases within each area that have been
28

responsible for the changes. Movements between
rural and urban areas were actually poverty-reducing, albeit on a very small scale.10
The rise in urban poverty has narrowed the
urban-rural gap and shifted the concentration of
the poor quite dramatically. In 2000, 7 percent of
all people in extreme poverty lived in urban
areas, while by 2014 this had increased to 24
percent (figure 2.15). While some of the change
between 2000 and 2006 can be attributed to a
post-census reclassification of rural areas, this
explains only a portion of the observed change
Poverty and Shared Prosperity 2000-2014

and does not affect differences between 2006 and
2014. The larger change has been in terms of
overall poverty. In eight years, the share of the
poor living in urban areas has gone up from 28
percent to 57 percent. The regional change in the
concentration of the poor is also quite striking.

The Metropolitan region of the country is now
home to almost 12 percent of the poor population: in 2000 the region only accounted for 7
percent of the poor (figure 2.16). There was also a
transformation in terms of the concentration of
the extreme poor, from just under 1 percent in

the indigenous poor used to be extremely poor,
the figure is now one in two. At the same time,
poverty among the non-indigenous has started
to rise. However, in terms of the share of the
country’s poor, poverty remains concentrated
among indigenous groups. They represent 52
percent of the total poor and 66 percent of the
extreme poor, yet constitute only 42 percent of
the population of the country (figure 2.17). Twothirds of all extremely poor households have an
indigenous head of household. A Oaxaca Blinder
decomposition shows that two-thirds of the differences in poverty between indigenous groups

and non-indigenous groups is due to different
endowments, while the remaining third is due to
unexplained differences in the returns to these
endowments.
There are significant differences among the
ethnic groups in Guatemala, both in poverty
levels and in trends. (See box 2.2 for a brief
discussion of the differences between the major
indigenous groups of Guatemala.) Areas with
greater concentrations of indigenous people tend
to be poorer, but many of the ethnic groups are
spread across departments with varying degrees
of poverty: this is particularly true for the

are, in general, more likely to live in rural
areas—in contrast the rest of the other population, which is split 50-50 between rural and urban
areas— which affects their access to services. However, there are large variations between the different
Mayan groups. K’iche are the most urban of the groups, with almost 40 percent of their members
living in urban areas while the Q’eqchí are the most rural at 84 percent. Indigenous people represent
the majority of the population in some departments but only a tiny minority in others (see Annex
2.3). Wherever possible in this report, the analysis is disaggregated by indigenous group.

non-indigenous and the Mam (figure 2.18). The
Mam had the highest poverty rate in 2000 at 90
percent, and live in both departments with high
poverty levels and in others with much lower
levels. By 2014, the Q´eqchi had overtaken the
Mam, having the highest poverty and extreme
poverty rates (87 and 56 percent respectively)
and representing 22 percent of the extreme poor.
In contrast the Kaqchiquel have the lowest
poverty rate among the indigenous groups
despite this rate having increased in both 2006
and 2014 (figure 2.19). As noted earlier, the Mam
have the highest chronic poverty rate, and none
of the indigenous groups have fewer chronically
poor households than the non-indigenous do.

The Human Capital Divide
There is an important interplay among income,
labor, and human capital (table 2.2). Poor
households in Guatemala have lower levels of
human capital than non-poor households, which
is reflected in wide monetary welfare gaps. The
heads of poor and extremely poor households
have, on average, slightly over 3.3 and 2.0 years
of education respectively compared with almost
seven years of education for non-poor heads of
household. The non-poor have a higher number
of dependents per worker, which is a slightly
unexpected finding. However, the average per
capita income and per capita consumption of
the extreme poor is about one -fifth of that of
the non-poor suggesting that the earnings of the
non-poor are significantly lower. Given the wide
gap in education between the poor and nonpoor, this is not surprising. Additionally, a large
fraction of the extremely poor who are working
are only doing so in the capacity of unpaid
family workers. The concentration of the poor
in agriculture (62 percent of the extremely poor
compared to 14 percent of the non-poor) and
higher levels of informal sector work (76 percent

32

versus 55 percent) may also contribute to the
observed dependency gap.

Other Demographic
Characteristics
Poor and non-poor households have significantly
different characteristics in terms of their household structure and employment status (table 2.2).
The poor are more likely than the non-poor to
live in male-headed households; in fact, moderate
and extreme poverty rates among female-headed
households are lower than the corresponding national figures and, in terms of overall poverty, the
rates have fallen.11 Even holding constant the type
of household involved (single adult households
with or without children or two adult households
with or without children), households headed by
men are more likely to be poor (see full results in
Annex 2.4). Poorer households tend to be much
younger: in 2014 the proportion of individuals
aged 14 years old or younger in poor households
was twice as large as in non-poor households.
Having a younger head of household is also correlated with greater poverty, with all other characteristics held constant. The poor and extreme
poor tend to belong to larger households than the
non-poor. Households in extreme poverty have
6.8 members on average while non-poor households have an average of three fewer members.
Having a head of household who is indigenous
but not one of the four large Mayan groups is
linked to a significantly greater risk of poverty, as
is living in the North and having less education.

Drivers of Changes in
Poverty and Shared
Prosperity
Consumption: Growth,
Distribution, and Prices
The increase in prices, particularly food prices,
is clearly linked to the rise in nationally defined
poverty in recent years (figure 2.20). Changes in
prices affect the real wages that households earn
and the costs of the goods and services that they
purchase. Figure 2.20 presents a Shorrocks-Kalenikov decomposition that looks at the relative
importance of changes in consumption growth,
changes in the overall distribution of consumption, and the changes in prices. It clearly shows
the significant effect that rising prices have had
on poverty since 2006. Without the increase in
prices, the poverty rate would have been substantially lower. Changes in the distribution of
consumption contributed to poverty reduction,
especially in the case of extreme poverty in the
latter half of the last decade as did the changes in
distribution. However, these gains were mitigated
FIGURE 2.20

by rising prices.
The rise in food prices since 2006 has had a
substantial impact on poverty levels through the
resulting increase in the value of the poverty line.
Overall, the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of
the population (roughly the group living in
extreme poverty) stayed the same over the 2006
and 2014 period: consumption was stagnant as
well. However, the rising prices of food caused
the real value of the food poverty line to increase
by 19 percent over the period, resulting in a large
increase in extreme poverty. In contrast, between
2000 and 2006, the real value of the extreme
poverty line rose by only 9 percent. The overall
poverty line with its large non-food component
(approximately half of the value of the overall line
is for non-food items and services) changed
much less, growing by only 3 percent between
2006 and 2014, after having fallen by just 1
percent in the previous period.

growth between 2000 and 2014 (figure 2.21).
Growth was pro-poor in the sense that the bottom decile saw a small annual growth in their incomes over the 2000 to 2014 period while the income of the higher deciles actually declined. The
negative slope of the growth incidence curves,
especially in the 2006 to 2014 period, helped to
bring income inequality sharply down. While the
magnitude of the change seems counterintuitive
given the increase in poverty, it is explained by
the fact that incomes declined among the highest
deciles, which has had the effect of reducing
inequality without reducing poverty.12/13

Sources of Income
Labor income in Guatemala has played a less
prominent role in poverty reduction than in the
rest of Latin America.14 Changes in poverty rates
can be explained by changes in labor earnings,
employment levels, private and public transfers,
and other non-labor incomes. Between 2000 and
2006, the two main drivers of overall and extreme
poverty reduction were a growth in employment
for both men and women and transfers. Labor

reduction as there was a strong negative relationship between men’s labor income and poverty
(figure 2.22). This result contrasts with the rest
of LAC where labor income, especially for men,
played a very important role in reducing pov-

erty in that period, to the tune of a 2 percent
reduction on average. In the early part of the last
decade, women’s labor income was associated
with a decline in poverty but, by 2006 to 2014,
both male and female labor incomes were linked
to higher poverty. In Guatemala, it was primarily
the increase in the share of men who were employed rather than the level of their earnings that
helped to lower poverty.
The contribution of public transfers to poverty
reduction has increased over the last 15 years.
Between 2000 and 2006, the reduction in poverty
associated with private transfers (largely remittances) and with public transfers was largely
similar. However, between 2006 and 2014, the
effect of public transfers grew, especially in the
case of extreme poverty levels, while the effect of
private transfers diminished (for overall poverty)
and grew only slightly (for extreme poverty). This
change indicates that the increased spending on
transfer programs (to be discussed in the next
chapter) did have a positive effect on poverty

levels and that targeting of these resources to
poorer households was successful.
The distribution of remittances, however,
appears to have shifted away from poor households. The levels of remittances remain high
(figure 2.24). In terms of the share of GDP, in
2014 remittances accounted for a substantial 10
percent of GDP. While this is a lower proportion
than in Honduras (17 percent) and El Salvador
(16 percent), it still represented a record for
Guatemala of US$5.8 billion. Most remittances
originate from the US (US$4.4 billion), followed
by Mexico (US$152.2 million) and Canada
(US$100.1 million). Remittances flows grew
substantially during the 2000s, peaking at US$4.5
billion in 2008, until they plunged to US$4 billion
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in
2009 (figure 2.24). Since then, remittances have
recovered sharply, and the number of emigrants
continues to grow (approximately 8 percent of
Guatemalans were living outside of Guatemala in
2013 with almost 90 percent of them living in the

36

US (figure 2.23).15 The fact that remittances
continue to grow but their effect on poverty has
declined or stagnated indicates that there may
have been a shift in the characteristics of recipient households.

Conclusion
In summary, the recent past has not been
favorable to Guatemala. Incomes have
declined as has consumption for all but the
poorest. The historical gaps between rich and

poor remain, and the country lags behinds its
peers in terms of its welfare indicators. Several
non-monetary measures of welfare related to
education and health appear to have improved,
and social spending has helped to reduce poverty.
However, labor markets have contributed little to
poverty reduction. There continues to be a critical disconnect between economic growth and
poverty reduction, with the two having moved
in opposite directions in recent years. The next
chapter addresses the issue of why growth has not
been inclusive in Guatemala.

Notes
1 See Annex 1.1 for details on countries considered as
Guatemala’s economic peers along with other comparator
countries used in this report.
2 The data presented in the first section of this chapter
are income-based measures compared to international
poverty lines. See Box 2.1 for an explanation of official
poverty measures in Guatemala and when these are
used and when the internationally comparable ones
are used in this report. However, as in this section and
wherever the focus is on international comparisons, an
income aggregate will be used as well as international
poverty lines as follows: US$1.25 per person per day (the
global extreme poverty line), US$2.5 per person per day
(extreme poverty line for LAC), and US$4 per person per
day (overall poverty line for LAC). The lines are in 2005
PPP terms. While there has been an update to the 2011
PPP for the US$1.25 line, there has been no update for
the US$2.5 and US$4 lines. For this reason, we have used
with the US$1.25 global extreme poverty line in 2005
PPP.
3 In consumption terms, overall growth was similar, but
growth for the bottom 40 percent was positive - 1.5 percent over the 2000 to 2006 period and then 0.3 percent in
2006-2011. This suggests some measurement problems
related to income among those at the lower end of the
distribution, but even the better consumption measures
show very weak shared prosperity in recent years.
4 As might be expected, a consumption-based Gini
shows much lower levels of inequality but the trend in
the consumption-based Gini is similar to that seen with
income. The decline in inequality between 2006 and 2014
is even more dramatic in consumption terms. The decline
in both urban and rural inequality can be seen in both
income and consumption terms.
5 One hypothesis about the change in the Gini that cannot
be ignored is that there may have been a deterioration in
the quality of data at the top end of the distribution over
time. There is always some degree of under-reporting:
studies of top earner databases from tax records in other
countries have shown that the Gini is often under-estimated as a result of non-responses from households
at the top end of the distribution. The concern is not
so much that this phenomenon exists but that these
non-responses may be increasing. Given the very sharp
rise in crime and violence in Guatemala, particularly in
the cities, it is quite plausible that households are not
willing to provide information on their wealth to surveys.

38

In Mexico the non-response rate in some areas of the
country has increased to 25 percent in recent years and
non-response is correlated to education levels, suggesting
that it is correlated to income as well.. No assessment has
yet been carried out of the increase in non-responses in
the latest round of the ENCOVI in Guatemala or of its
implications, so until that happens, a degree of skepticism
about the magnitude of the fall in the Gini might be
warranted.
6 These figures were calculated using a synthetic panel
method (Dang et al, 2011) as there are no real panel data
sets in Guatemala that would allow the study of a household’s movements in and out of poverty directly. The
overall poverty rates from this analysis will not exactly
match the national poverty figures as, first, the analysts

used an international poverty line of US$4 per capita
per day in PPP terms, which is slightly higher than the
national line in Guatemala of PPP US$3.17, and, second,
the methodology only incorporated households that were
formed in 2000, meaning that younger households were
under-represented in the analysis compared with standard poverty analysis. See Annex 2.2 for the comparison
of mobility with Central America and Latin America.
To ensure that our estimates of mobility are comparable
methodologically with the LAC and CA results, we have
used the 2011 ENCOVI data. The issues of comparability between the 2000 and 2011 rounds of the ENCOVI
suggest that our analysis may overstate the numbers
of households who rose out of poverty. Our mobility
analysis within Guatemala is based on the 2000 and 2014
surveys and thus suffers from no comparability issues.
The panel of municipalities was created using small area
estimation techniques a la Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw,
2001). Given data limitations estimates could only be
made for rural municipalities. See Baez et al. (2015) for
further details.
No figure is available for extreme poverty in 1989.
Changes in the definition of rural and urban areas
between 2000 and 2006 make earlier comparisons suspect: see Box 2.1.
Huppi-Ravallion decompositions look at intra-area and
across areas changes in poverty. The within-area increase
in poverty was 8 percentage points, but the across-area
movements mitigated this effect, resulting in a 7.6 percentage point rise in overall poverty. For extreme poverty,
the within-area increase in poverty was 4.1 percentage
points, while movements from rural to urban areas led to
a small decline in poverty for an overall rate of 3.7.

11 World Bank (2009).
12 An alternative hypothesis is, of course, that non-responses may be affecting reported income: crime and
violence, particularly extortion, have risen in recent
years, which might have reduced people’s willingness to
give accurate responses to surveys.
13 The picture is slightly more positive in terms of growth
in consumption: consumption inequality decreases
mainly because of growth in the bottom of the distribution while income inequality decreases mainly due to
income reductions in the top of the income distribution
(see Annex 2.5).

3. Inclusion and Exclusion
Labor markets have played only a limited role in changes in welfare in Guatemala. The number of jobs has
increased at the same pace of GDP, which has contributed to poverty reduction. However, the quality of these
jobs has not: earnings are stagnant, especially in the sectors in which the poor are most likely to work. The
lack of human capital affects individuals’ ability to find the types of productive employment that would help
them to move out of poverty. This lack of human capital stems from limited access to basic services such as
education and health. Coverage of these and other services is far from universal and the influence of
geography, ethnicity and household characteristics on inequitable access have changed little in the past 15
years. The poor and ethnic minorities bear the brunt of unequal opportunities and poor outcomes. Spending
patterns restrict Guatemala’s ability to provide universal access to basic services as the low levels of revenues
collected limit the provision of public services. At the same time the incidence of spending is such that overall
fiscal policy actually increases poverty. Inequality is not lowered by the sum of direct and indirect taxes and
transfers. On a range of indicators, Guatemala is not catching up to its peers and competitors, which is
hindering future economic growth, job creation, and welfare gain and putting its social contract under
further stress.

Progress on generating an inclusive
model of development in Guatemala has
been slow. Any positive change has often been
outweighed by structural features that perpetuate
poverty and inequality. Many Guatemalans are
faced with limited job opportunities and stagnant
earnings. In part this is the result of an economic
structure that does not facilitate the adequate creation of well-remunerated jobs (see discussion in
Chapter 4). In part, however, it reflects a lack of
human capital. Much of the population has limited access to the basic services and infrastructure
that would allow them to increase their human
capital and escape poverty. A basic underinvestment in public goods is the main reason behind
the story of limited opportunities, while spatial
inequalities, an inefficient use of resources, and
weak institutions exacerbate the situation.

Inclusion and Exclusion

Limited Labor Market
Opportunities
Labor markets have played only a limited
role in changes in welfare in Guatemala. High
and rising poverty stands out as a pressing challenge for Guatemala. As discussed in Chapter 2,
contrary to the experiences of other countries in
Latin America, labor incomes have not contributed to poverty reduction in Guatemala. Over
the 2000-2014 period, there has been a decline
in earnings. In particular, the fall in the labor
income of men contributed to an 8.4 percentage point increase in poverty while increases in
women’s labor incomes only reduced poverty by
0.6 percentage points. This trend is particularly
worrisome given the rapid growth of the labor
force in Guatemala, which presages further
declines in earnings unless the country is able to
generate better paying jobs for its citizens. There
is a small dynamic private sector, but most of
the jobs remain informal, without social security

protection. As discussed in more detail in chapter
4, productivity is low and declining.
The Guatemalan labor force, like the overall
population of the country, is quite young and
growing. In 2014, more than 40 percent of the
labor force was under age 30.1 The economically
active population grew by 4.4 percent per year, or
about 225,000 people, between 2010 and 2014.
The growth in the economically active population
in recent years has not entirely been due to
population changes as some of the growth may
reflect people moving back into the labor force as
the economy recovered from the global financial
crisis. However, demographic trends guarantee
that the supply of labor will continue to grow in
the near future. The supply of labor could also
increase substantially if the labor market were to
become more attractive to women: female labor
force participation in Guatemala is the lowest in
the region. Despite these population pressures, at
the national level unemployment is low, just 2
percent in 2014. However, the rate has risen
substantially since 2000, particularly among

women, urban workers, and most indigenous
groups (figure 3.1). This trend suggests some new
constraints on labor demand.
Perhaps the most striking change in the labor
force in the past 15 years has been the increase in
wage employment with no accompanying
increase in the share of formal sector employment (figure 3.2). Between 2000 and 2006, there
was little change in the composition of the labor
force but in the following eight years the share of
the poor and extreme poor in wage employment
increased by 32 and 41 percent respectively
(figure 3.2). This has largely been driven by a
drop in unpaid family work as well as the almost
complete disappearance of employers among the
poor. However, the shift towards wage employment has not been accompanied by a commensurate change in formality or in earnings. In 2000,
informal employment, defined as not having
access to social protection, constituted 72 percent
of the labor force, and by 2014 this had risen to
82 percent.2

42

Inclusion and Exclusion

Earnings have fallen sharply despite the move
to greater wage employment, a clear indication
that minimum wage legislation is not binding
(table 3.1). Both median monthly and hourly
earnings have fallen in real terms for the poor
since 2000. This fall has been substantial almost 9
percent in hourly earnings for the extreme poor
and 11 percent for workers in the bottom
quintile. Monthly earnings have fallen by even
more, indicating an increase in underemployment as the numbers of hours worked has
decreased. Again, these findings suggest that
there are new and rising constraints on labor
demand that will impede poverty reduction.
The poor continue to be concentrated in the
agricultural sector —although less so than
previously—and the commerce sector (figure
3.3). Between 2001 and 2013, agriculture as a
sector grew strongly in Guatemala at 3 percent,
just below GDP growth. However, the sector is
characterized by a dynamic export sector
(exports have grown annually 11.5 percent since

effects on poverty reduction showed that a rise in
agricultural employment was associated with an
increase in poverty.4 An analysis using synthetic
panels showed very high levels of chronic poverty
among households engaged in agriculture, both
in the 2006 to 2014 period and over the longer
2000 to 2014 period.5 There was a strong rise in
earnings in the commerce sector between 2000
and 2006, followed by a steep decline by 2014.
For households engaged in commerce in 2000,
there was a strong movement out of poverty (18
percent of households) by 2006, but this upward
mobility between 2006 and 2014 was more muted
(9 percent), reflecting declining earnings in the
sector. The agricultural and the commerce sectors
account for the majority of informal employment
(36 and 29 percent respectively).
The sectoral composition of the labor force
within each ethnic group largely reflects the
rural-urban concentration of the groups (figure
3.5). Among the predominantly rural Q’eqchi, 67
percent work in agriculture, while the more
urban K’iche have less than half as many working
in agriculture. The Kaqchikel appear to have a

slightly different labor force than their Mayan
peers. On the one hand, they have a much more
diversified labor force than their urban-rural
shares would suggest. They are also the group
with the lowest share of their labor force (albeit
still high) working in the informal sector (78
percent compared to around 90 for the Mam,
K’iche, and Q’eqchi).

Constrained Human
Capital Accumulation
Low levels of human capital in Guatemala
prevent individuals from accessing high quality
jobs and limit poverty reduction. Human capital
plays an important role in earnings. Hertz et al.
(2008) found that the substantial wage differences between rural and urban areas were largely
explained by the differences in the endowments
of the two populations, of which education was
key. The same was true within the rural sector:
the substantial earnings advantage of non-agricultural workers was due mainly to differences
in endowments.6 In 2014, 30 percent of the wage
gap between rural and urban areas was explained
by differences in education while 37 percent of
the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous
workers was due to differences in education
levels.7 Human capital in the form of health also
influences economic outcomes.8 An important
longitudinal study in Guatemala showed that
better childhood nutrition had a substantial positive impact on adult earnings. Males with lower
malnutrition as children had earnings, on average, that were 46 percent higher than their more
malnourished peers.9 In the case of Guatemala,
where the economy has a limited ability to generate good jobs and the country is characterized
by fast population growth, individuals with little
human capital are at a particular disadvantage.
The progress that Guatemala has made in terms

Inclusion and Exclusion

of human capital accumulation over the last 20
years has not been enough to catch up to its peer
countries. The 1996 Peace Accords created an
important impetus toward creating a new model
of inclusive growth, laying out an overall agenda
of inclusive human development with a focus on
increasing the capacity of the state and emphasizing the need to promote equity for indigenous
people and women. This has led to a realignment
of the government’s objectives, some re-direction
in public spending, and the setting of new revenue targets in the last two decades. There has certainly been some evidence of progress and better
outcomes, particularly in educational enrollment
and child mortality. However, the program set
out 20 years ago has neither been fully realized
nor been enough to break historical patterns of
inequality of opportunities. Levels of health and
education in Guatemala remain below those of
its peer countries, and the gaps between groups
within Guatemala are sizeable. In education, the
notable headway that has been made in enrollment rates and test scores has not been enough
to make up for Guatemala’s low starting point
vis-à-vis other countries. In health, the picture
is less positive as some measures show progress
while other critical ones related to malnutrition
and maternal mortality have changed little if at
all. For all measures of human capital, the ethnic
gap is striking, and there is often a sizable gender
gap as well.

Malnutrition
Guatemala is an outlier in the region in terms
of chronic malnutrition (stunting). Data from
2014-15 show that almost half of all children in
Guatemala (47 percent) are stunted, an indication
of the high levels of poverty and inequality in the
country (figure 3.6).10 This rate of chronic malnutrition is higher than that of any of its peers.
Bolivia and Ecuador are the closest, but their

Inclusion and Exclusion

rates are only 27 and 25 percent respectively.
Among countries that have data on malnutrition
since 2010, Guatemala’s rate of chronic malnutrition is lower only than those of Yemen, Papua
New Guinea, Eritrea, and Burundi, two of which
are low-income countries.11 A smaller but still
considerable share of children (12.6 percent) is
underweight.
The persistently high chronic malnutrition
rates in Guatemala illustrate a lack of the most
basic type of human capital - good health. The
overall change in both indicators of malnutrition
in the past six years has been negligible: stunting
declined by only 3 percentage points from its
2008-09 level of 50 percent and underweight
declined from 13.1 percent to 12.6 percent. Even
within this small positive change, there are some
worrying signs. In the 0 to 5 month age cohort,
30 percent of children are stunted, and by the age
of 19 to 23 months, stunting increases to 54
percent, a pattern that has not changed since
2000. However, stunting among the youngest
group has risen from 22 percent since 2008-09.12
The differences in stunting rates across wealth
quintiles are large, ranging from 66 percent in the
lowest quintile to 17 percent in the highest, again
a pattern similar to that of previous years. Of
concern is the fact that, while the level of stunting
among children in the bottom 40 percent has
fallen since 2008-09, there has been a small
increase for those in the top two quintiles.
Finally, malnutrition rates have actually increased
in several departments: in El Progreso and Jalapa
stunting rose by 15 and 9 percent respectively
(figure 3.7). However, the gravity of the malnutrition story is best illustrated by the fact that, even
in the department with the lowest levels of
stunting, Guatemala, three out of ten children
suffer from chronic malnutrition. In absolute
terms, the number of children suffering from
stunting has gone up 10 percent since 2008, an
increase of almost 100,000 children.

The ethnic and geographic gaps within the
country are large although there has been some
closing of the gap. Rates of malnutrition remain
substantially higher among the indigenous
population: almost two of every three indigenous
children suffer from stunting (61.2 percent)
compared to one in three among the non-indigenous population (34.5 percent). However, the gap
has shrunk slightly: since 2008-09, the decline in
malnutrition among indigenous people has been
greater than among the non-indigenous group (7
and 4.7 percent respectively). Differences
between departments continue to be large, with a
ratio of almost three to one between the departments with the highest and the lowest levels of
malnutrition, but malnutrition has declined
slightly in almost all departments. Izabal stands
out with a stunning one-third decline in stunting
in just six years. Once the new data from the
2014-15 Demographic and Health Survey
(ENSMI) are available, it is hoped that analysis of
these data will yield insights into how this was

achieved and how malnutrition could be reduced
nationwide.
Guatemala’s progress in reducing chronic
malnutrition has been slow. Between 1987 and
2000, stunting went down at a rate of 2 percent
annually. In contrast, in Brazil over a similar
period (1986-1996) the annual rate of change was
6 percent. Stunting in Guatemala fell to its lowest
point in 2000 (44 percent) but rose again by 2008
and has fallen only slightly since then from 50 to
47 percent, an annualized rate well below that of
previous years. In terms of underweight (acute
malnutrition), after a strong positive change in
the early 1990s progress has also been slow in
recent years. The slow rate of change in malnutrition rates seems to suggest that recent government programs have been unsuccessful,
particularly the Ventana de los 1000 Días, which
was supposed to improve child outcomes through
better pre- and ante-natal care as well as through
strong nutritional interventions. However, it is
possible that the program has played a role in the

46

Inclusion and Exclusion

recent positive changes in child mortality (see
below), and this result may be confounding the
malnutrition findings. If very malnourished
children who previously died now survive, the
program may be causing mortality rates to fall
while increasing malnutrition rates. In the
absence of a deeper study of the evolution of
malnutrition and child mortality, this remains a
hypothesis that needs to be tested.
What is often called “hidden” hunger also
affects children and adults in Guatemala. Hidden
hunger refers to a lack of micronutrients in
children’s diet that impedes their growth and
development. In 2014, 53 percent of households
reported that, due to a lack of resources, their
children ate an unbalanced diet or a diet limited
in diversity.13 Among extremely poor households, this figure rose to 74 percent. Iron deficiencies or anemia, which hinder the intellectual
development of children, affect 25 percent of
children in Guatemala.14 While high, this level
represents a significant decline since 2008 when
the figure was 48 percent. Iodine deficiency
affects 14 percent of the population. Of seven
countries studied in Latin America, only
Honduras had higher levels of deficiency. Fewer
than half of all households (40 percent) have
access to iodized salt. Thirty-five percent of
children under the age of 5 had levels of zinc
below accepted norms. Vitamin A deficiencies,
which harm the immune system, affected 16
percent of pre-school children in 2009-10. The
severity of this deficiency had showed up in an
earlier study,15 which estimated that 1,500
children died annually in Guatemala due to
Vitamin A deficiencies. With the exception of
anemia figures, no recent analysis exists to update
these other indicators of hidden hunger.
However, the overall rate of deaths from
malnutrition in Guatemala has undergone a
tremendous decline from 20.7 to 11.5 per 100,000
suggesting that there have been improvements in
Inclusion and Exclusion

many factors, particularly in the provision of
nutritional supplements and supplementary
feeding.16 The Zero Hunger program that
explicitly tackles hidden hunger as well as
seasonal hunger may be one of the factors
contributing to this success.

Health
Apart from chronic malnutrition, many health
indicators have substantially improved over the
past 15 years. Guatemala is on track to meet the
MDG for under-5 mortality, although there is
some evidence that the rate of decline in child
mortality is slowing.17 The share of pregnant
women who receive pre-natal care has increased
and is on par with the Central American average
at 93.2 percent. Life expectancy rates rose by 12
years between 1990 and 2013 to 72 years, and
the rate of serious infectious diseases such as
tuberculosis decreased from 75 to 60 per 100,000
between 1990 and 2013. Between 2008 and 2014,
the share of births attended by doctors or nurses
rose as did the share of children who received
appropriate post-natal care (figure 3.8). The latter
indicator changed considerably, again suggesting that recent government programs have been
effective in some areas.
Progress has been made in some measures of
maternal and child care, but inequities remain.
Changes have often not benefited the poor as
much as the non-poor and have yet to fully close
the gaps between the “two Guatemalas.” Despite
improvements since 2008, in 2014 the majority of
births by women from the lowest quintile were
still attended by midwives rather than doctors,
only one-third of all births were attended by
either a doctor or a nurse, and 15 percent of all
births took place with no trained assistance at all.
In contrast, 96 percent of births in the top
quintile were attended by doctors or nurses. The
recent substantial rise in post-natal care among

all groups has actually led to a widening of the
gap between the top and bottom quintiles as the
rate of improvement among the 3rd and 4th
quintiles was three times that of the first quintile.
The only indicator for which the poor appear to
have an advantage is in vaccinations, but all
groups have surprisingly low levels of full
vaccination.18 Levels of vaccination have actually
dropped substantially since 2008 contrary to
what would have been expected given the
intensive government programs to improve child
health outcomes and the observed increase in
post-natal care. There has been a particularly
alarming fall in the rate of measles vaccinations
from 78 percent of all children under the age 2 in
2008 to only 63 percent in 2014. The largest
declines were for those in the bottom three
quintiles. Understanding the causes of this
decrease is urgently needed as an outbreak of
measles or other diseases could partially erase the
important gains in child mortality that have been
achieved to date.
48

Other health indicators continue to be of
concern. Guatemala’s maternal mortality rate is
the highest in the LAC region. The regional
average was 87 per 100,000 births in 2013
compared with 140 for Guatemala (figure 3.9).
This rate has held steady for the last 10 years,
meaning that Guatemala is far from meeting the
MDG on this indicator. Neonatal mortality, while
having fallen fairly steadily since 1972, has been
resistant to change in the past 15 years, despite
the increase in pre-natal care. The burden of
ill-health in the country is also uneven. Almost
three-quarters of maternal deaths are among
indigenous women, and births by indigenous
women are half as likely to be attended by a
skilled professional as those births by the rest of
the female population. Indigenous and rural
women are more likely to suffer from anemia
than their urban counterparts. While infant
mortality rates are falling nationally, they are
much higher in the Northwest and the Northeast
regions. The rate of decline varies. The rate for

previous chapters (figure 3.10).

of males, but by 2014 they had 92 percent. The
greatest increase was for indigenous women,
the most disadvantaged group. In 2000 they
had 35 percent of the schooling of non-indigenous males, but by 2014 they had 63 percent. In
absolute terms this remains a wide gap but at the
same time represents real and positive change.
Nevertheless, disparities by location and ethnicity
remain striking (figure 3.13). Rural inhabitants
have, on average, only 5.8 years of schooling,
compared to 8.6 in urban areas. The gap between
indigenous and non-indigenous people is 2.4
years of education. Overall, the gender gap is relatively small, just over half a year. However this
masks two important features: non-indigenous
women have less of a gender gap, having levels
of education that are only 0.2 years less than
their male counterparts compared to a 1.2 year
gap between indigenous men and women. Also,
indigenous women have 2.1 years less education
than the national average. Despite these shortcomings, if these rates of convergence continue,
the historic inequality in education can be erased.

Education
Guatemala’s substantial increases in education
levels have exceeded those of its peers. Between
1970 and 2010, Guatemala’s rate of increase in
years of schooling outstripped most of its peers,
with only Bolivia, El Salvador, and Brazil having
improved faster (figure 3.11). Overall there has
been a significant improvement in schooling:
those who have gone through the school system
more recently (18 to 30 year olds) have 2.3 years
more schooling than the population as a whole.
This progress has been evident across most
groups, and some of the most disadvantaged have
had faster rates of improvement (figure 3.12). In
2000, among the 18 to 30-year-old population,
women had only 82 percent of the schooling

At the primary education level, Guatemala has
made significant strides, both in increasing
overall coverage and in decreasing inequities in
access. In sharp contrast with earlier periods,
there are few differences by location and ethnicity
as primary school enrollment became almost
50

universal in 2009. Between 2000 and 2006, the
schooling gap due to ethnicity in Guatemala went
from around 3.5 years to less than a half year, a
significant achievement (Ferreira et al, 2013),
although literacy rates still vary by ethnicity. In
2014, the Q’eqchi had the lowest literacy rates in
Inclusion and Exclusion

any language at just under 67 percent (figure
3.15), compared to a national rate of 84 percent.
However, they have the highest literacy rates in a
Mayan language.19 The Kakchikel have the
highest literacy rate of any indigenous group at
78 percent, which however is 6 percent below the
national average.
A cause of concern is that universal primary
enrollment has declined since 2009. Even since
reaching near universal enrollment in 2009 (99
percent) enrollment has fallen and, by 2014, net
primary school enrollments had fallen to 82
percent, which was even lower than it had been
in 2000. A simple analysis of changes in the role
of different factors on enrollment shows that
there have been changes since 2000 in terms of
geographic areas and ethnicities.20 In 2000,
children outside the Metropolitan region were
slightly more likely to attend primary school than
those in the Metropolitan region. However, by
2014, this has changed for children in the
Northwest, Southwest and Northeast who
became less likely to attend school than those in
the Metropolitan region. The probability of
enrollment among indigenous children overall
also declined slightly, and this decline was higher
than for more groups. There are two hypotheses
as to why this change is occurring. First, preschool attendance also fell, and there is a link
between pre-school attendance and the transition
to primary school. However, a recent study in
Guatemala found that pre-school attendance
increased the probability of successful completion of primary school by only 2.4 percent.21

Additionally, the primary school enrollment
drop-off preceded that of the pre-school enrollment drop-off, and the pre-school attendance
rate has started to recover whereas this is not the
case for the primary school rates. This suggests
that, while declining pre-school enrolment may
have been part of the cause, it is not the only one
and, of course this begs the question as to why
pre-school attendance fell. A second hypothesis
about the changing primary school enrollment
rate is that the denominator, or the number of
children of school age, is wrong and has become
less accurate over time given the large-scale
international migration of children. In the
absence of a new census this hypothesis cannot
be tested. It is hoped that the new census will be
fielded soon as understanding and addressing the
factors affecting these negative changes in
enrollments is critical if recent gains in schooling
are not to be lost. Finally, other factors, such a
rising demand for child labor or worsening of the
security situation may be affecting enrollment.
Further concerns exist regarding the levels of
educational attainment at the secondary level.
The share of children aged 15 to 19 years old
who have not completed the nine years of
schooling mandated in the 1985 Constitution is

Guatemala’s peer countries has, a lower secondary school completion rate. Given where
Guatemala started, even with the recent increases
in secondary enrollment rates, secondary
enrollment remains lower than the levels in its
peer countries (see Figure 4.32). In Guatemala,

the drop-off in enrollment is fairly steep: there is
almost universal enrollment in the first grade of
primary school, but the rates begin to drop off
very quickly after that. Only half of the enrolled
children finish their first year of secondary

school. Gross enrollment in secondary school is

Inclusion and Exclusion

The human capital outcomes discussed
above are affected by inequities in access to basic
infrastructure and services. Low and unequal
access to basic infrastructure—electricity, water,
and sanitation—and services—education, health

care, and social protection—persists in much of
Guatemala. Access to infrastructure has increased in recent years, but coverage is far from
universal. There are clear geographic patterns of
access to services (figure 3.18). Those living along
the corridor linking the Caribbean and Pacific
ports have greater access to electricity, water, and,
especially, sanitation, while those in the poorer
regions of Northwest, Petén, and the Northeast
have significantly fewer services. Guatemala’s 90
percent access rate to electricity is the fifth worst
in LAC (behind only Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua,
and Guyana). Reflecting the duality in Guatemalan society highlighted in Chapter 1, 97 percent
of the population in the Metropolitan region has
access to electricity while only 54 percent of the
people in Verapaz do. In addition to inequities
in physical access to electricity, high electricity
prices hinder access to electricity in practice
and perpetuate social exclusion. Lower-income
households are more vulnerable to high electric-

repeats a grade—contribute to this low attainment. Critically, the educational gaps after the
primary level begin to divide along ethnic,
geographic, and gender lines. By the age of 18 the
enrollment gap between indigenous and non-indigenous youths is close to 15 percentage points,
and there is a 20 percentage point difference
between the share of rural girls who complete 9th
grade and the share of urban boys who do so
(figure 3.17).

ity prices because energy expenditures account
for a larger share of households’ expenditures. In
periods of high oil prices, the cost of electricity
can become unaffordable for the lower strata of
population. Therefore, the recent drop in prices
has been a boon.
The share of the population covered by basic
services has increased in the past 15 years.
Similar to the trends in enrollment rates, access
to infrastructure increased more quickly for the
bottom 40 percent of the population and for
indigenous groups, helping to start to close the
gap between the “two Guatemalas.” The provision
of basic services largely mirrors the concentration of welfare and population in the departments around the capital, although geographic
patterns of coverage are not completely correlated
with poverty. Suchitepéquez and Sololá, which
have quite high poverty rates, also have high
coverage of electricity (although Suchitepéquez
has limited sanitation services and Sololá has
little access to piped water). The initial high levels

of inequality in service access mean that ethnic
and socioeconomic characteristics continue to be
correlated with access to basic infrastructure,
despite the positive progress that has been made
(figure 3.19). Access to sanitation has increased
for all groups. This is the service both with the
lowest coverage and with the largest gains.
However, gaps between groups remain. Even if
access continues to expand at recent rates,
universal coverage is still not going to be
achieved in the short run.
The extent to which a child has access to basic
infrastructure in Guatemala depends on the
characteristics of his or her household. As shown
above, there is an equity gap in access to services
in Guatemala due to a lack of universal coverage.
There is an additional equity gap that occurs
because access to social infrastructure is not
evenly or randomly distributed but instead is
correlated with specific characteristics of the
population. The World Bank’s Human
Opportunity Index (HOI), an equity-adjusted

measure of coverage, shows that the distribution
of service provision is such that household
welfare, ethnicity, parental education, and
geographic location, among other things, are
highly correlated with access (figure 3.20).23 In
2014, Guatemala had the third highest gap, as a
share of coverage, in Latin America for electricity,
the fifth highest for water, and the second highest
for sanitation. Levels of sanitation remain
particularly low in Guatemala although the 2014
figure represented a 17 percentage point increase
over 2000 (figure 3.21). The influence of these
circumstances on access has diminished over
time, in part due to increased service access
across all circumstance groups (the so-called
scale effect) and in part due to a change in the
underlying population, most likely due to
increased urbanization. The equalization effect,
or increased service provision to previously
underserved groups appears as an important
factor driving an increase in the HOI for electricity provision. For water and sanitation, the
composition effect is behind the recent improvements in the HOI. The small equalization effect
Inclusion and Exclusion

suggests that inequities will persist as there will
be slow convergence of coverage rates among
groups.
The improvements in the HOI reflect changes
in the role played by different circumstances in
explaining unequal access (figure 3.22). The
significance of living in an urban area has
declined, reflecting both the expansion of
services beyond cities and the growing share of
the population living in cities. Parental education
and income also have decreased in importance.
Ethnicity, in contrast, has increased in importance: a child of the Q’eqchi people continues to
have a lower probability of accessing services
than other indigenous groups and the gap
between Q’eqchi children and other indigenous
groups has widened period, The evidence for
other indigenous groups is mixed, with some
appearing to have gained and other to have lost
in terms of access to these basic services.
Access to health care is also limited, and
geographic disparities persist. Health care
infrastructure has increased in the past 25 years.
The number of primary health facilities, those
55

used most by the poor, has increased by 44
percent since 1990, and primary health centers
with beds for maternal and child health services
have increased by 67 percent. The greatest
increases came after the Peace Accords. However,
the overall provision of health services is still low,
and there are sharp inequities in this provision.
The ratio of health facilities to population varies
across the country, with the Northern and
Central regions having the lowest ratios. There
are many fewer facilities in the Northwest where
a large share of the country’s indigenous and
rural populations lives. In the Petén area, also a
poorer region of the country, primary health care
facilities offer only a limited range of services
(figure 3.23). The departments with the lowest
facility to population ratios are Alta Verapaz

FIGURE 3.23

(0.38 health posts per 10,000 inhabitants, well
below the standard of five health posts per 10,000
inhabitants) and Guatemala City (0.26).
The provision of health care in remote rural
areas has increased although recent events may
have changed this trend. An estimated 4.5 million
people in remote rural areas rely on a basic
package of health services provided under the
Coverage Expansion Program (Programa de
Expansion de Cobertura or PEC). Under this
program, the government contracted with private
and non-governmental agencies to provide a
basic package of health care via a mobile health
system that visits each community once a month.
The program has expanded access to health care
and may be credited with contributing to the
improvements in health outcomes of recent years.

At its inception the program was meant to be
temporary, and the government is now rolling
out a replacement program. However, the
transition has not been smooth. In mid-2014 the
government moved to close down the PEC. Of
the 390 PEC contracts that were signed in 2014,
72 contracts were suspended in Huehuetenango,
Jutiapa, Southwest and Northern Petén, Izabal,
Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, Quiché,
Chimaltenango, Northwest Guatemala, El
Progreso, Alta Verapaz, and Chiquimula, leaving
approximately 2.3 million people with no access
to health care.24 As a result, the number of health
care visits nationally dramatically declined in
2014.25 In February 2015, the Ministry of Public
Health (MSPAS) cancelled the remaining PEC
contracts, leaving a gap in service coverage until
April 2015 when the MSPAS started rolling out
its new primary health care (PHC) model using
mobile health teams comprised of MSPAS staff
rather than NGO staff. By June 2015, however,
this new PHC model only covered 48 percent of
communities in Guatemala.

Education services are also not evenly distributed nor are they accessible to all children. At the
primary school level, public provision of schools
is fairly even. Bilingual education has increased,
and 24 percent of all primary schools offer
bilingual education.26 Nonetheless, Guatemala
has the third highest HOI coverage gap in Latin
America, suggesting that inequities remain. Also,
there are many barriers to accessing the secondary and tertiary levels. First, the distribution of
secondary schools is less even than that of
primary schools, and, as might be expected, areas
with low population density are under-served.
Given the correlation between poverty and rural
areas of low density, this means that the distribution of secondary public schools penalizes the
poor. At the departmental level, the poorer the
department, the lower the number of secondary
schools on a per capita basis (figure 3.24). The
reverse is true for primary school coverage,
reflecting in part the smaller size of rural primary
schools (86 students on average) than urban ones
(243 students) (figure 3.25).

Constitution that this level of schooling be both
mandatory and free. At the upper secondary
level, only 26 percent of all students receive
education provided by the state. At the tertiary
level, there is only one public university, which
accounts for just under half of all tertiary-level
students. The cost of the private provision of
schooling is a barrier to access. Half of the
students who drop out of secondary school in
Guatemala do so for reasons of money, the
highest rate in Central America (figure 3.27).
Parental education continues to be the key
determinant of a child’s school enrollment, which
reflects a lack of intergenerational mobility in
terms of education (figure 3.28). This is not
unique to Guatemala as other countries in the
region show similar patterns. Nonetheless, given
the low levels of education in Guatemala, the
effect of this is particularly negative. The impact
of parental education has grown over time, while
household income and location have decreased
in importance. Ethnicity continues to explain
enrollment although change has varied by
indigenous group. The effect has shrunk over
time for the Q’eqchi but risen slightly for the
other Mayan groups (figure 3.29).

The Role of Spending
and Institutions in
Limited Opportunities
Ineffective Spending
Spending patterns affect the government’s ability
to provide universal access to basic services.27
Typically, governments use fiscal policy to
redistribute spending to the poorer segments of
the population with the goal of lowering poverty
and inequality and equalizing opportunities. In
Guatemala, however, the fiscal system fails to do

Inclusion and Exclusion

this. In part this is because of the very low level of
revenues that are collected, which puts considerable limits on what can be spent. Even within this
tight budget envelope, however, the fiscal system
does little in the way of closing the income gaps
or removing inequalities in Guatemala. Fiscal
policy (direct and indirect taxes and transfers)
has no effect on national inequality as measured
by the Gini coefficient. Only when in-kind
benefits from health and education spending
are taken into account does the Gini decline by
0.024 to 0.53, a very small change. Brazil, which
started with a similar level of income inequality
as Guatemala, has achieved a decline of 0.14 in
its Gini, and Costa Rica has lowered its inequality
by 0.12 percentage points. In terms of poverty the
impact is worse. Overall fiscal policy has actually
led to an increase in poverty. The few transfer
programs that are progressive (direct transfers
that are both pro-rural and pro-indigenous) are
small and have been reduced further since this
analysis was done, and their benefits are offset by
the fact that a large share of tax revenues comes
from consumption taxes (see Chapter 4 for
details). Households whose incomes fall between
the international extreme poverty line of US$1.25
per capita per day and the LAC extreme poverty
line of US$2.5 per day are net payers into the
fiscal system. Nor does the system close the gaps
between ethnic groups. The market income of the
indigenous population has been calculated to be
only 32 percent of that of the non-indigenous,
and after all taxes and transfers had been taken
into account, this only changed by 1 percentage
point. While the conditional cash transfer program is pro-indigenous, total education spending and health spending are not and represent
a much higher level of spending. Finally, fiscal
policy does little to equalize opportunities in
Guatemala, again in contrast with Brazil, where
the government was able to use fiscal policy to
equalize opportunities.
59

Overall, spending on education is only slightly
progressive in Guatemala (figure 3.30). As might
be expected, pre-school and primary spending is
the most progressive whereas tertiary spending is
quite regressive. Upper secondary school
spending is skewed toward the non-poor, but it is
less inequitably distributed than overall (market)
income. However, tertiary education spending is
more unequal than income equality overall. The
amount spent on tertiary education is only a
one-seventh of total education spending but,
combined with upper secondary spending,
benefits the upper income groups to the extent
that it is almost enough to make all education
spending regressive.
There is evidence that public spending on
education is ineffective and inefficient. Concerns
about the quality of education center on the poor
scores that Guatemalan students achieve on
international tests. Although these scores
improved between 2006 and 2013, Guatemala
still scores below the Latin American average on
3rd and 6th grade reading and math (figure 3.31).
Only the writing of 6th grade students outperforms the Latin American average. Data from the
Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) show that

FIGURE 3.30

the quality issues affect all grades: only one in
four upper secondary graduates has achieved the
standard level in reading, and only 10 percent
have achieved the equivalent in mathematics
(World Bank, 2015). Further concerns about
educational quality are raised by Guatemala’s
extremely high repetition rates. As will be noted
in Chapter 4, one out of every eight primary
school students repeats a grade in Guatemala,
almost double the rate in El Salvador, the country
with the next highest rate. Only 62 percent of
children finish sixth grade on time, another
indicator of quality issues. While this represents
significant progress since 2000 when just 37
percent of Guatemalan children finished sixth
grade on time, only Nicaragua and Honduras
have lower levels. The quality of education
available to children is also related to the child’s
circumstances. One proxy for education quality,
the share of children who finish 6th grade on
time, is low in Guatemala. However, the equity-adjusted level (using the HOI) was only 56.
Ethnicity is one circumstance that is particularly
strongly related to finishing 6th grade on time
and whose impact has increased over time.28

children is due to differences in the quality of
schooling that they receive.29
As shown above, overall public spending on
health care is regressive (figure 3.30).30 This is
true despite the fact that the vast majority of
individuals in the upper quintiles of the income
distribution use private health care. However,
they also use the services provided by the
Guatemala Social Security Institute (IGSS) while
poorer households are much more likely to use
MSPAS facilities for health care. Per capita
spending by the MSPAS is only one-fifth to
one-fourth that of the IGSS, which has led to
inequities in the quality of care and to the overall
regressiveness of public spending in this area. The
use of private health care by not only the rich but
also the poor is high, indicating a lack of access
to public health services and, perhaps, to the
perception of quality differences (figure 3.32). In
indigenous communities, the lack of health
professionals in the public system who speak

indigenous languages is another barrier to
accessing good health care.
A recent World Bank analysis has also suggested that health spending is inefficient. The
study found that simply increasing the efficiency
and not the amount of spending could create
gains of the order of 12 percent in terms of
decreasing infant mortality and chronic malnutrition and increasing child measles immunization coverage (figure 3.33).31 And while public
health spending is correlated with decreasing
child mortality, spending levels seem to have little
impact on malnutrition levels, perhaps reflecting
the myriad factors that affect malnutrition
beyond access to health care (figure 3.34).
Inefficiencies stem from a lack of coordination
among institutions that has led to duplication of
efforts and a lack of economies of scale that could
lower the costs of medical supplies and drugs. In
addition, while the MSPAS has been piloting
results-based budgeting for maternal and child
health services since 2012, overall budgeting still
tends to be historical, based on existing services
and infrastructure with some adjustments for

the clear, historical correlation between spending
and outcomes (figure 3.36).
The government has made a strong spending
commitment to pre-primary and primary
education, but this appears to have come at the
expense of secondary education.33 Public
spending on these two lower education levels
amounts to 61 percent of total education spending, which is higher than that of all but one other
Central American country. Between 2007 and
2013, per capita spending on pre-primary and
primary students rose, with pre-primary spending increasing by over 60 percent (from US$272
to US$446) and primary increasing by 6 percent
(from US$480 to US$509). Meanwhile, enrollments also rose (by 11 percent in pre-primary
and 2 percent in primary). The net effect was to
substantially increase the amount of resources
going to these two levels. However, given the
limited overall budget envelope available for
education, this resulted in a drop in per capita

Inadequate Spending
A further limitation on human capital formation
in Guatemala is simply that spending is too low.
Guatemala spends a significantly lower amount
on education as a share of GDP than its peers
(figure 3.35). Public education spending has
increased as a share of GDP, reaching 3 percent at
its peak in 2010, up from 2.7 in 2007.32 However, on a per capita basis, spending has actually
declined since 2009 by almost 13 percent in real
terms, which reflects population pressures, the
expansion of coverage, and a slight dip in spending as a share of GDP. This is unfortunate given

secondary spending of 12 percent as enrollments
rose while the overall level of spending remained
the same. The low spending on secondary
students (just under half of that spent on primary
students) is a serious barrier to increasing
secondary enrollment and to improving the
quality and equity of secondary education. At the
lower secondary level, many of the richer
students opt for private schooling, an option
which is not available to poorer students. Among
young people not attending secondary schooling,
46 percent cite a lack of resources as the principal
cause, well above the 17 to 23 percent figures in
El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.
Levels of spending on health are too low to
provide adequate health care to the population.
In comparing actual levels of services to the
facility-to-population standards, recent data from
the MSPAS have shown that the number of
health posts in 2013 was only enough to supply a
population one-fifth the size of Guatemala’s and

that secondary-level health facilities would be
adequate for a population one-quarter the size of
the present one. In short, even if public health
was perfectly targeted to the poor, only one-half
of the poor would have access to secondary
health services and even fewer to primary health
care. The government has made an effort to direct
more spending to health care: as a share of GDP,
health care spending has increased from 1.8
percent of GDP to 2.2 percent between 2007 and
2013. However, given the increase in the population during that time, per capita spending
remained flat (figure 3.37). This level of spending
is among the lowest in Central America.
Importantly, private, out-of-pocket expenditures
in Guatemala are quite high, substantially higher
than in LAC and in other lower-middle-income
countries (figure 3.38).

below the original approved budget: in 2010 it
had been 23 percent higher. For the Ministry of
Health, the differences were also large - minus 8
percent in 2008, 11 percent in 2009, and 13 percent in 2011. This variation in available resources,
combined with delays in releasing budget funds
each year, makes it difficult for the line ministries
to plan and to follow through on their policy
objectives. Budget delays also affect the RBB
implementation.
The institutions within each sector are fragmented and have limited oversight. In the case of
health, a lack of coordination within the health
sector has contributed to the inefficient use of
resources. The MSPAS lacks resources to cover a
large portion of the population and the IGSS
mainly provides services to Guatemala City. The
fragmentation of systems increases costs. While
there are recent efforts between the MSPAS and
IGSS to jointly purchase certain medicines with
other countries in Central America, further
coordination is needed (e.g. having a single
medicines list and standardized bidding

The negative effects of inadequate social spending
are compounded by Guatemala’s weak institutions. The overall institutional weaknesses in
the country further limit the ability of the line
ministries to provide quality services. The way
in which budgets are determined provides little
room for empirically based policymaking.34
Aside from the results based budgeting (RBB)
agreement piloted between the MSPAS and the
Ministry of Finance for child and maternal health
and nutrition related services, the budget process
is largely driven by historical budget trends, thus
maintaining traditional inequities in spending
and impeding efforts to target spending to poorer
areas or populations. At the same time, considerable uncertainty is created by the budget process
itself. The variation in the composition of the
executed budget compared to the original allocation was double the international standard in
2011. For the Ministry of Education, this meant
that the end of year budget in 2008 was 9 percent

documents, and having an integrated public
policy on medicines) to increase economies of
scale in medicines and equipment purchases. In
addition, although the MSPAS has piloted
integrated service delivery networks in some
areas, the overall patient referral and counter-referral systems remains weak leading to overuse of
expensive tertiary care services. At the same time,
the MSPAS has neither the resources nor the
capacity to carry out its supervisory role of the
sector. A similar situation exists in the education
sector where legal issues are affecting the ability
of the education system to provide high quality
services. The 25-year-old Education Law still
lacks the bylaws needed to formally define the
responsibilities of the different actors in the
sector, which has led to fragmentation and
inefficiencies in the system.35 The existence of a
series of newer laws enacted since 1991—the
1995/96 Peace Accords, the current Law of the
Executive Power (Community Participation), and
the regulatory framework for decentralization—
further complicates the issue of institutional
responsibility and also requires institutional
strengthening at the local level.
Institutions have weak monitoring and
evaluation systems and this affects the costs and
quality of the services provided and limits
accountability. Institutional fragmentation is
mirrored in their information and monitoring
systems. In the social sectors, for example, there
are pieces of a strong monitoring system but
there is no coordination mechanism. In the
education sector, data are collected and disseminated on standardized tests scores and on the
characteristics of all schools. Legislation in is in
place for teacher evaluations to be carried out as
well. However, these systems are not linked,
teacher evaluations do not take into account the
learning outcomes of their students, and the data
are not used systematically in policymaking. In
the health sector, progress has been made in

terms of creating a unified management information system (MIS) and of increasing accountability. To date, the MIS has linked together the
Hospital Information System and the Health
Management Information system (SIGSA). A
new database on staff is being created by MPSPA
to form an Integrated Human Resource
Information System (IHRIS). However, there are
still gaps in the system that limit both quality and
outcomes. Improving monitoring and evaluation
systems is also a key to increasing transparency
and accountability in the health system, which
continues to face challenges on this front. The
new census of public employees that is under
discussion by the government that will collect
and link information on contractors, employees,
and procurement systems is a concrete step
towards increasing transparency in the sector and
also, it is expected, the effectiveness of spending.

The Link between
Limited Opportunities
and Poor Human Capital
Outcomes
The low levels of services and infrastructure in Guatemala play an important role in the
country’s high and persistent levels of malnutrition. The UNICEF framework (1990) highlights
the role that environmental factors such as
access to water and adequate sanitation play in
determining malnutrition rates, along with food
security and dietary diversity, health care, and
child care practices.36 (Potentially important data
on food contaminates could not be included; see
Box 3.1.) Using data from the 2008/9 ENSMI (as
data from the 2014/5 survey round were not yet
available) and following the method developed
in Skoufias (2015), we constructed a measure
of adequacy for each of these four factors and cal-

BOX 3.1 Is it Food Contamination: What Role do Mycotoxins Play in
Malnutrition in Guatemala?
One unknown in Guatemala is the role that mycotoxins (aflatoxins and fumonisins, fungi that
contaminate corn and other food crops), are playing in chronic malnutrition. Neither the UNICEF
framework nor the analysis done in this study address the issue of mycotoxins.
Aflatoxins and fumonisins are naturally occurring toxins produced by certain fungi. In high doses,
they can lead to serious illness and even death in both humans and animals. These mycotoxins mainly
accumulate on crops and grains in tropical regions and contaminate a wide variety of food crops and
products, such as maize, peanuts, sorghum, and cassava. In corn, the fungi infect plants both prior to
and after harvest. Poor growing conditions as well as inadequate storage conditions promote the
growth of the fungi. The toxins pose serious health risks to humans and are closely linked to liver
cancer and the suppression of the immune system, thus increasing exposed individuals’ vulnerability
to other diseases. More recently, significant negative effects of aflatoxin on child growth have been
reported (see Khlangwiset et al, 2015 for a review of the evidence on both child outcomes and
livestock, while IITA, 2015 cites studies showing that stunting was 40 percent more frequent in areas
with high aflatoxin contamination). Exposure to these mycotoxins can begin in utero and continue
throughout life.
In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) highlighted that, taken together, the
few well-documented population-based studies and the mechanistic data in relevant animal models

BOX 3.1 continued
suggest that mycotoxin exposure contributes to stunting, both independent of and with other risk
factors. IARC suggested the need for further longitudinal studies of mycotoxin exposure and child
stunting, including studies of the underlying mechanisms.
There is evidence of aflatoxins and fumonisins in Guatemala. A study in 1976 indicated high levels of
aflatoxins on the Pacific Coast (De Campos and Olsyzna-Marzys, 1979). A follow-up study in 1979
(De Campos et al, 1980) showed one in six corn samples to be contaminated with levels of aflatoxin
well above acceptable levels. A 2002 study (Truckess et al, 2002) found aflatoxin contamination in
samples of INCAPARINA, a high-protein, corn and cottonseed-based food supplement given to an
estimated 80 percent of children in Guatemala in their first year of life. Most recently, another small
study done by the Full Belly Project in 2012 (Pawloswski) found evidence of aflatoxins in peanuts in
the Estanzuela, Zacapa). A larger study (Torres, 2013) tested corn samples from across the country
and found unacceptably high levels of aflatoxins in 27 percent of samples and high levels of
fumonisms in 41 percent of the samples.
Co-exposures to aflatoxins and fumonisins have also been documented. Recently, maize from 22
districts in Guatemala was analyzed and 36 percent of 572 samples tested positive for aflatoxins and 99
percent of 640 samples tested positive for fumonisins. The contamination levels are well above the
permitted levels (Torres et al. 2015).
The link between aflatoxins and stunting and other poor growth outcomes among children in
Guatemala has not yet been proven. Gathering evidence of the role played by aflatoxins in malnutrition is critical. To date, efforts to reduce malnutrition have focused on health care (substantial
investment in pre-natal and post-natal attention). Addressing the dangers of aflatoxins would require
a completely different set of policy options and targets.

culated the correlation of these with the z-score
of height for age (stunting). In addition, we
explored the interactions between these measures
of adequacy. Our results highlight how a household’s lack of access to infrastructure and its food
insecurity are both associated with malnutrition
(table 3.2).
Limited access to basic infrastructure is a key
correlate of poor nutritional outcomes. At the
departmental level in Guatemala, a lack of access
to sanitation is linked closely with malnutrition
rates (stunting), with malnutrition being higher
Inclusion and Exclusion

in areas with limited access to sanitation (figure
3.39). Interestingly, the opposite correlation
applies between access to water and the malnutrition rate, suggesting that there are important
interactions between water and other variables
linked to malnutrition.37 The correlation is
greater in rural areas and among less wealthy
households.
The relationship between health care services
and malnutrition is not as straightforward.
Adequate health care for children is comprised of
prenatal visits to expectant mothers (the World

Health Organization’s standard of four visits),
births assisted by a trained medical profession
(including midwives), follow-up growth monitoring visits for newborns, up-to-date immunizations, and Vitamin A supplements. For richer
households, health care is significantly correlated
with taller children, but for other groups, and
even nationally, receiving adequate health care
has no significant effect. This could be a reflection of lower quality services being available to
the poor. Alternatively it may be an issue of
demand, in that only the sickest or those at the
highest risk visit health facilities given the
difficulties and costs of accessing health care for
poor and rural populations.
Child care is a third correlate of malnutrition.
Adequate child care is difficult to measure. One
component affecting childcare is the education of
a child’s parents, more particularly that of its
mother. Evidence from other studies has shown
that maternal education is highly correlated with
child health and nutrition outcomes. However,
there are multiple ways in which education can
affect child care, which makes it an imperfect
measure of the adequacy of child care. Therefore,
in this analysis child care adequacy includes a
measure of a women’s empowerment, specifically
her ability to make decisions about household
purchases. A measure of breastfeeding practices
and the timing of complementary foods has also
been included as part of child care. The greatest
effects of adequate child care can be found in
rural areas, suggesting that child care may be of
particular significance in areas with limited
health care and more inadequate sanitation.
Poverty and food insecurity are fundamental
correlates of malnutrition. Having access to
adequate food is correlated with taller children.
However, there is substantial evidence of food
insecurity in Guatemala. As noted earlier, slightly
more than half of households (53 percent) have
reported that their children ate a diet limited in

diversity due to a lack of resources at some point
in the previous three months. Thirty percent of
households reported that at least one child in
their household had eaten less than he or she
should have, and one in 12 households had at
least one child who ate only one meal or did not
eat at all for one or more days (figure 3.40).
Among the extreme poor, levels of food insecurity are much higher, with 45 percent of households reporting that at least one child in the
household had eaten less than he or she should
have, one-quarter of households reporting that
their child(ren) had had to miss a meal, and one
in eight extremely poor households reporting
that their children had eaten only one meal a day
or none at some point over the previous three
months. Among ethnic groups, the Mam, the
non-indigenous, and the Kaqchiquel have similar
levels of food insecurity. The group with the
lowest food security appears to be the Q’eqchi.
These patterns reflect the inability of households
to smooth their consumption due to poverty, a

agricultural cycle. April to August are considered
to be the months of greatest food insecurity in
Guatemala.38 Although the agricultural sector
employs a large share of the poor, the vast
majority of households in Guatemala (83
percent) are net food consumers and thus are
sensitive to food price changes. It has been
estimated that rural poverty grew by 1 percentage
point because of the food price increases of 2008
(Robles and Torero, 2010).
There is limited evidence of positive synergies
among the four factors. The analysis highlights
the significance of each factor with regard to
malnutrition. Compared to inadequate levels of
all four factors (which characterizes a startling 41
percent of all Guatemalan children), having
adequate levels of both food and health care is
correlated with the greatest height gain. Having
adequate levels of both food and child care is
linked with the next highest level of height,
followed by having both, food and adequacy in
environment factors (water and sanitations).
However, in addition to each individual factor
Inclusion and Exclusion

being correlated with greater height for age, it is
expected that the interactions between the factors
would provide an additional effect beyond the
sum of the two individual effects. However, the
evidence for this synergy effect is mixed. Only
among the poor is there a significant positive
interaction effect, specifically between food and
health, and between child care and heath. For
rural populations, there are some synergies,
depending on the specifications of the model,
between environment and health and child care
and health.
Other health outcomes are affected by a lack of
access to electricity, especially for cooking. More
than half of the population of Guatemala relies
on solid fuels, mostly wood energy, for cooking
and heating. About 2.4 million or more than 70
percent of Guatemalan households cook and heat
their houses with traditional stoves. More than 50
percent cook primarily with wood, while an
additional 20 percent of households cook with
wood in combination with other fuels (referred
to as “fuel stacking”). Using traditional stoves for

KNOWLEDGE GAP
The data available for the analysis of the UNICEF framework are from 2008/9. Since then the
Government of Guatemala has implemented two important programs aimed at improving child
malnutrition. While the overall rate of malnutrition has fallen only slightly, there are large variations across groups and areas, and other health indicators have changed. An analysis of the 2014/5
data of the ENSMI, when they become available, will shed light on these recent changes and
provide inputs into the government’s new nutrition policies. Collecting additional data on food
contamination, specifically aflatoxins in corn, will also be needed to determine what, if any, role
this plays in chronic malnutrition.

cooking has negative implications for health as
well as being costly for households financially.
Traditional cooking adversely affects the health of
women who cook and the children in their care,
causing almost 5,200 deaths every year due to
indoor air pollution. Traditional stoves also emit
pollutants, with each stove producing approximately three tons of carbon dioxide annually. The
heavy reliance of Guatemalan households on
solid fuel for cooking is the highest in Central
America. Guatemala has the highest level of
annual mean air pollution exposure in Central
America, measured in particulate matter
(PM2.5). Guatemalan families who use traditional stoves and purchase wood spend an
average of 40 percent more money each month
on overall cooking costs than similar households
who use improved, higher efficiency stoves.
Additionally, cooking with traditional stoves has
gender implications since women devote around
11 hours a week collecting wood and around 13.5
hours a week cooking. Forest degradation is also
a consideration since traditional stoves consume
more than twice as much wood as improved
stoves, and the depletion of natural resources,
negative health effects, and time devoted to
non-income generating activities hinder rural
development by limiting the ability of rural
70

communities to escape the poverty trap. The poor
are disproportionally affected by these effects as
they are the most reliant on traditional stoves and
wood for cooking.
Socioeconomic mobility is affected by
infrastructure and human capital. Between 2000
and 2011, those rural municipalities that moved
up from being among the poorest (those with
more than 75 percent of their population in
poverty) to being in the next group (those with
50 to 75 percent of their populations in poverty)
had very different characteristics from those
stayed in the poorest group. Access to services,
such as water, sanitation and electricity, was
higher in those municipalities with falling
poverty, road density (and thus access to markets,
economic opportunities, and other services) was
higher (figure 3.41), and the share of indigenous
people lower (figure 3.42). An earlier study
analyzing synthetic panels between 2000 and
2006 had similar findings.39 The lack of human
capital, along with geographic location, ethnicity,
and a lack of job opportunities had prevented
segments of the population from benefitting from
economic growth during those years. Households
that were poor in 2006 had had very different
characteristics in 2000 than those that were not
poor in 2006. In 2000 they were more likely to

have been working in the informal sector, to have
significantly lower levels of education, and to live
in rural areas. The education gap between heads
of household who were poor in 2006 and those
who were in the middle class was 3.5 years in
2000.40 Seventy percent of those who were poor
in 2006 had been rural residents in 2000, and 80
percent had worked in the informal sector.
It is important to recognize, however that
human capital endowments alone do not fully
explain labor market outcomes and welfare
outcomes. A Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition
using 2014 data shows that, while two-thirds of
the wage gap between indigenous and non-indigenous populations can be explained by differential endowments, this leaves one-third
unexplained. The wage gap between indigenous
and non-indigenous workers is wider than the
gap between rural and urban workers. Returns to
schooling are declining across the board, and of

further concern is the fact that, the returns to
schooling vary by both ethnicity and gender
(figure 3.43). The gap between indigenous and
non-indigenous workers in terms of returns to
any level of schooling is large and has remained
fairly constant in recent years. Earlier analysis
found that, despite women having more education than men, they earn less, in what is referred
to as hyper-discrimination.41 This differential in
earnings unrelated to endowments may well
explain why female labor force participation in
Guatemala has been so low. However, more
recent data show that, holding all else constant,
women now earn slightly more than men (as of
2014), reflecting both an increase in endowments
(female education levels have risen, particularly
among indigenous women) and the returns to
those endowments.42

Vulnerability
The absence of a strong safety net in Guatemala
combined with the country’s vulnerability to
natural disasters and crime and violence may also
be playing a role in the persistence of poverty.
Guatemala is one of the countries that is most at
risk of natural disasters and is also afflicted by
high rates of crime and violence. While the government has increased social spending in recent
years, the fact that around two and a half million
additional people fell into poverty between
2000 and 2014 (and more than half of these into
extreme poverty) suggests that the safety net is
inadequate.43
Guatemala has increased social protection
spending in the past seven years, mainly through
cash transfers and subsidies (figure 3.44). As
shown in Figure 3.30 above, cash transfers are
progressive, with a majority of the benefit going
to the poorest segments of the population. Bono
Seguro (a conditional cash transfer program
previously known as Mi Familia Progresa) and

72

food distribution schemes such as Vaso de Atol
and Bolsas Escolares Solidaridad reach between
40 and 50 percent of the poor and are reasonably
well targeted. However, there is still substantial
leakage to the non-poor, and the absolute amount
spent on social assistance is dwarfed by social
security spending, which mainly benefits those in
the top quintile (figure 3.45). A simple accounting exercise that compares poverty rates with and
without the Bono shows very little change in
poverty attributable to the Bono. Overall poverty
without the Bono in 2014 would be only slightly
higher (60 percent compared to the actual 59.3
percent), and even if the Bono were perfectly
targeted, it would still only reduce poverty to
58.1. The program’s effect on extreme poverty is
larger: in the absence of the program, extreme
poverty would be 24.9 percent instead of the
actual 23.4 percent. If existing leakage to nonpoor beneficiaries could be eliminated, the
program could lower extreme poverty by another
0.8 percentage points or by almost 125,000
people.44 Reports about inconsistent payments

and cuts in benefits suggest that the program’s
impact may have declined in more recent years;
the share of GDP spent on cash transfers fell
from a peak of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.1
percent in 2013 (figure 3.46) while coverage
jumped up from 281,000 households to 758,000.
The increase in social protection has been too
small to have any significant impact on poverty
given the number of households covered by the
conditional cash transfer program. Other cash
transfer programs, such as the non-contributory
pension program, reach only a small share of
their target populations (less than 20 percent),
and their effect on welfare has not been studied.45
Low overall spending limits the ability of social
assistance programs to reduce poverty and
promote shared prosperity. Social protection
spending has declined in the past four years, with
cash transfers taking a disproportionate hit
(figure 3.46). Spending levels in Guatemala are
below those of all of its Central American
neighbors: spending as a share of GDP is less
than one-half the levels of Costa Rica and
Panama, countries with much higher GDP levels
than Guatemala (figure 3.47). Efforts by the

previous administration to coordinate programs
(by creating the Ministry of Social Development
and the new Unique Registry of beneficiaries)
and to improve targeting are positive developments. It is not clear, however, that the efficiency
gains from these actions can be enough to offset
the low and, in some cases, declining spending
patterns.
To some extent remittances have played a
social safety net function and have facilitated
human capital accumulation. A study using data
from the early part of the 2000s found that
remittance-receiving households were more
likely to spend their money on education and
housing than households not receiving remittances.46 Households with emigrants were found
to have stunting rates 6 percentage points less
than those for non-migrant households due to
the increased food security and lower morbidity
facilitated by the receipt of remittance payments.47 Households with members who had
migrated had greater food security and dietary
diversity.48 Finally, a survey of migrant households in 2005 showed that remittances provided
10 percent of equity financing for small

businesses, well above the 2 percent provided by
the formal banking sector, and favoring agriculture where the presence of the banking sector is
particularly limited.49
Remittances, however, are a precarious safety
net and not an ideal vehicle for human capital
accumulation. On the one hand, remittances are
highly seasonal as many migrants work in
agriculture and construction, both of which tend
to have a notable downward trend in the early
part of the calendar year (figure 3.48).50
Additionally, and more importantly, evidence
from the global financial crisis has shown that
remittances are pro-cyclical, rising with economic growth and falling during the crisis: the
dip in remittances in 2009 was striking (see
chapter 2). In general, the share of households
receiving remittances has fallen over time, from a
high of 22 percent of all households in 2000 to
only 9 percent in 2014 (figure 3.49), and richer
households are more likely to receive remittances
than the poorest households. Overall, remittances
as a share of household income rose in 2006 and

BOX 3.2 The Changing Profile of Guatemalan Emigrants to the United States
and Mexico
Migration has had many causes in Guatemala. The first wave of emigration of Guatemalans to the
US and Mexico began during the second phase of the civil war when large numbers of Guatemalan
refugees escaped in the late 1970s. Violence related to the war in this period centered in the western
Mayan highlands, forcing the local, mainly Mayan, populations, into refugee camps in Mexico. The
negative impact of the war on economic growth also intensified labor emigration to both Mexico and
the US. Today, however, the drivers of Guatemalan emigration to the US are different. In addition to a
general lack of economic opportunity and high levels of inequality and poverty, a series of natural
disasters has also led to Guatemalans leaving the country. In the past two years, the spread of the
coffee rust fungus has affected 70 percent of Guatemala’s coffee crop, causing the loss of an estimated
100,000 jobs and a 15 percent decline in output. Hurricanes Mitch (1998), Stan (2005), and Agatha
(2010) and a powerful earthquake on the southern coast in 2012 all increased emigration significantly.
Crime and violence, connected to gangs, drug trafficking and criminal organizations, constitute
additional drivers of emigration, together with Guatemala’s generally weak rule of law.
Since 2012 a further characteristic of Guatemalan emigration has consisted of the ballooning
number of unaccompanied minors (UAM). In 2013 over 75 percent (approximately 51,000) of
UAMs apprehended by U.S. migration authorities came from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
Most Guatemalan migrants are young males with limited education and financial literacy, trying to
support their direct family members at home. Overall, Guatemalan immigrants in the US tend to be

workers were primarily engaged in agricultural activities, services, sales, and no skill activities, and as
a result in the US they tend to work as unskilled workers, mostly in construction, services, restaurants,
and hotels. This combination of lower educational attainment and concentration in low-skilled jobs of
the recent waves of immigrants suggests that it is the less well-off who are increasingly emigrating
from Guatemala. In other words, there has been a significant shift in the self-selection of Guatemalans
who choose to leave the country in search of work. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on
the levels of remittances (which, unexpectedly rose sharply in 2015).

massive increase in remittances seen in 2015 (a
15.2 percent increase over 2014 levels) will affect
poverty.51 A further reason why relying on
remittances as a safety net is precarious is the
changing nature of Guatemala’s migration flows.

BOX 3.3 The Downside of Migration
While emigration provides opportunities for individuals and families to escape from violence, to find
better economic opportunities, and to send much-needed income to their households in their country
of origin, it is not without its costs. In addition to the Dutch disease discussed in Chapter 4, migration
can have a high human cost.
The migration experience itself can lead to negative outcomes for the Guatemalan emigrant, ranging
from death or injury to various forms of labor exploitation. The migration corridor through Mexico is
one of the busiest and most dangerous in the world (IOM, 2004). In a six-month period in 2010, more
than 11,000 kidnappings of migrants were reported (CNDH, 2011). A 2013 survey on the southern
border of Mexico revealed that almost 60 percent of emigrants from Central America suffered from at
least one episode of violence while crossing the southern border including robbery, sexual violence,
and extortion (Secretaria de Gobernación et al, 2013). Children and adolescents are particularly
vulnerable, whether traveling in family groups or alone.
Most of the migrants from Guatemala are undocumented in their destination countries. Being
undocumented makes migrants vulnerable to exploitation. A recent study of female migrants from
Guatemala working in southern Mexico found them to be victims of various forms of labor exploitation, from forced overtime, low or unpaid wages, restriction of freedom of movement and/or communication, and physical and sexual violence (World Bank, 2016).
The families whom migrants leave behind also suffer from their absence. A study in the south-east of
Guatemala documented how households whose head had migrated were excluded from social
assistance and in-kind programs on the erroneous (as it turns out) assumption that migrant households are better-off. A lack of empowerment and skills and a shortage of labor all can negatively affect
the welfare of migrant-sending households as well (Coello et al. 2015).

remittance story suggests that other factors, such
as the increase in the number of migrants, are
increasing remittance levels (See box 3.2 for more
details on the changing face of migration).
Finally, migration has a downside as well,
creating costs for migrants and their households
as well as for the economy (See box 3.3 and the
discussion in Chapter 4.)

Inclusion and Exclusion

Convergence and
Divergence
Our analysis of the persistent inequities in Guatemala raises concerns not only about the present
but also about the future of the population. The
analysis has found that the distance between the
“two Guatemalas” is shrinking slowly at best.
Despite progress, in some cases quite significant
progress, in improving several key indicators of
non-monetary welfare, Guatemala’s low starting point means that the country will continue
to lag behind its peers and, unless it is able to
77

generate a faster rate of change than its peers, this
situation will continue. At the same time, other
indicators are not changing, leading to a divergence between Guatemala and other countries,
especially its economic competitors. There is a
risk to Guatemala in diverging from the development paths of other countries. The fact that
poverty has not fallen and malnutrition rates
remain high creates concerns for the quality of
life of the population and for the strength of the
economy. The continued large gaps in secondary
and tertiary education access and attainment are
reducing Guatemala’s productivity, its ability to
create well-paid, sustainable jobs, and its attrac-

tiveness to investors going forward. The lack of
basic infrastructure and health care will continue
to cost the population in terms of morbidity and
mortality and act as a brake on economic development. There have been some positive trends
in terms of convergence on education test scores,
falling infant mortality rates, and better services
related to childbirth, and this suggests that it is
possible to tackle the other problems that are preventing social inclusion. While more spending
is needed, institutional reforms are also needed
to make spending more effective and to improve
service delivery.

Notes
1 The information on the labor force between 2010 and
2014 is based on the authors’ analysis of the Encuesta
National de Empleo e Ingresos (ENEI).
2 Of the three measures of informality calculated, two
showed an increase and one showed no change between
2000 and 2014.
3 Twenty percent of agricultural land is in the hands of
92 percent of the farmers. Our characterization of the
agricultural sector, unless otherwise noted, is from World
Bank (2015b).
4 See Cadena et al. (2013).
5 A synthetic panel is generated from multiple rounds of
cross-sectional data using imputations techniques base
on Dang, et al. 2011. See Annex 3.3 for the details of
this. Note also, the analysis from 2006 to 2014 is likely to
be more representative of all households in the country
today than those households included in the 2000 to 2014
analysis as the latter analysis is based on households that
existed in 2000 and thus captures none of the changing characteristics related to households formed more
recently.
6 The analysis uses an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.
Note that the data used for this analysis are from 2000,
and it is expected that some changes have occurred. An
update of the analysis is planned with the new round of
the ENCOVI.
7 Based on authors’ calculations using the 2014 ENCOVI.
There was a total wage gap between urban and rural
populations of 18 percent and between indigenous and
non-indigenous of 19 percent.

and earnings see Luft (1975) and Case et al. (2005).

Ramirez-Zea et al. (2010), and Martorell et al. (2010).
10 These figures are from the latest round of the
Demographic and Health Survey (Encuesta Nacional
de Salud Materna-Infantil, or ENSMI) carried out in
2014-15 (MSPAS et al. 2015). While some findings of
this survey have been published and are used here, the
data set itself is not available. Thus, some of the analysis
of malnutrition in this report continues to rely on the
previous round of the ENSMI from 2008-09 (MSPAS et

previous years. World Bank (2012) reported a 40 percent
rate while Paz (2014) reported a 20 percent rate. The
lower rate is based on the 2009-10 micronutrient survey.

health care visits nationally from 7 million to 23 million
visits annually between 2009 and 2013 followed by a 46
percent decline in 2014. While there are some concerns
that the SIGSA under-reports visits, in recent years
reporting has improved, suggesting the observed fall in
visits is probably real even if the magnitude is open for
discussion.
26 Given that Guatemala has 23 spoken languages, it is
not always clear that bilingual education will be able to
ensure that children are taught in the language that they
spoke prior to attending school. Further information
is needed on the how bilingual schooling is working in
practice.

prior to his or her second birthday the measles vaccine,
three doses each of DPT and polio (excluding the polio
vaccine given at birth), and one dose of BCG (MSPAS et
al. 2015).
19 The sample size of the survey data used in this analysis
is adequate at best for looking at these groups. The other
groups are too small to be able to be examined separately.
There are some concerns about the adequacy of the sample even for the larger groups.
20 See Annex 3.1 for the probit analysis on which this discussion is based.
21 Bastos et al. (2016).
22 There is a discrepancy between the survey data (from the
2014 ENCOVI) and the administrative data concerning
the rate of completion of nine years of schooling. The
survey indicates that two out of three children do not
complete this level, while the administrative data indicate
that only 55 percent do not. It is not clear what is driving
the discrepancy. However, neither figure suggests that
Guatemala has been able to fulfill its Constitutional
obligation regarding education.

35 The 1991 law needs to be updated to incorporate this
other legislation as well as to reflect the changing landscape in education in Guatemala in the past 25 years. As
argued in World Bank (2015b), the significant increase
in enrollments at both the primary and secondary levels
has decreased the needs for the non-formal education
system, and this needs to be brought into alignment with
the formal system.
36 This is the basic framework developed by UNICEF
(UNICEF, 1990).
37 The results cited here are based on ongoing work being
done by Katja Vinha and Kinnon Scott using the 2008-09
data. A similar analysis will be carried out on the 2014-15
ENSMI once these data become available so that changes
in the importance of different correlates of malnutrition
can also be identified.

43 The rise is due both to an increase in the poverty rate as
well as to an increase in the population. Between 2006
and 2014, the population of Guatemala grew by 2.5
million so, even if poverty rates had remained the same
between 2006 and 2014, the numbers of poor would still
have risen by 1.3 million, 0.4 million of whom would
have been in extreme poverty.
44 This simple estimation may overstate the impact of the
program on poverty. Households often respond to receiving public transfers by changing their labor supply or by
sending or receiving remittances.

4. Trends and Drivers of Growth in
Guatemala
Guatemala has experienced modest economic growth in recent years. Its per capita GDP has failed to
converge with those of Latin America (average) and that of the U.S. With a relatively young and growing
population, Guatemala will need to achieve much higher economic growth and job creation rates to reduce
poverty. Persistently low levels of physical and human capital formation have contributed to a long-term
decline in productivity. Like other countries with high poverty levels, Guatemala faces the challenge of
creating new and better remunerated jobs for its growing working age population, a challenge that is complicated by the prevalence of informality in the economy. Persistent competitiveness challenges related to the
under-provision of public goods, rising crime and violence, and weak governance are exacerbated by weak
economic institutions, which complicates the investment climate for the private sector and perpetuates
inequalities. Guatemala’s demographic trends provide an opportunity for higher and sustained growth
provided that the government implements productivity-enhancing investments and policies, such as infrastructure investments to increase connectivity and industrial policies to foster the creation of better jobs.
However, given Guatemala’s low levels of public revenues and immense investment needs, spending efficiencies may not be enough.

Growth Trends
Guatemala is known for having persistently
low growth in per capita GDP as a result of a
combination of modest aggregate GDP growth
and a fast growing population. GDP growth
averaged 3.5 percent between 2000 and 2014
(figure 4.1), slightly above the Latin America
average of 3.2 percent but not particularly strong
when compared to other economies in Central
America (4 percent) or to Guatemala’s aspirational peers (4.9 percent).1 When converted into
per capita growth rates, Guatemala averaged a
very low 1.2 percent in those 14 years, about 1
percentage point lower than the regional average
(figure 4.1). This is not surprising given the
population growth rate of 2.1 percent per year,
which is almost two times higher than the
average for Latin American countries (1.1
percent) and the highest in the region.2

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

The current size and future expansion of the
working age population provides Guatemala with
a window of opportunity to seize a demographic
dividend. This dividend is possible because the
working age population is growing more rapidly
than the dependent population, resulting in more
people that could potentially contribute to
growth. The working age population increased
from 51.4 percent in 1960 to 58.1 percent in
2014, while at the same time the dependency
ratio declined from 94 percent to 72 percent.3
However, reaping the benefits of this potential
dividend will depend on the existence of effective
policies to foster labor productivity (such as
education) on urban development, and on the
ability of the private sector to create jobs with the
highest development payoff. Without both
productivity-enhancing investments and policies
to remove constraints to private sector growth,
which will be discussed later in this chapter, the

majority of the poor will have to continue to
work in low-productivity jobs with low earnings
and be trapped in chronic poverty.
Meanwhile, Guatemala has not advanced in
converging with the United States. In 2014, its
per capita GDP was 6.7 percent of that of the U.S.
whereas in 1960 it was 8.4 percent (figure 4.2a).
Meanwhile, the average per capita income of
84

other Latin American and Caribbean countries
relative to the United States has increased from
12.2 percent to 18.1 percent. Guatemala’s
performance in this respect has been similar to
that of Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua,
neighboring countries with shared development
challenges (figure 4.2b). In contrast, Panama and
Costa Rica have made much headway in

converging with the United States. Today, in
terms of per capita GDP, Guatemala is the fifth
poorest economy in the Latin American region, a
drop of five positions from its rank in 1960. The
ever-growing gap between Guatemala and other
countries raises the question of what the
underlying causes are behind this divergence.
This lack of convergence has occurred despite
prudent macroeconomic policies. The Central
Bank has made efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability, keeping inflation low, stable, and
well within target ranges. Moreover, manageable
levels of fiscal deficit (around 2.1 percent since
2000) have contributed to levels of debt below 25
percent of GDP. This fiscal discipline has been
achieved even though Guatemala has one of the
lowest tax burdens in the world (10.8 percent of
GDP in 2014), an issue that is discussed further
in Chapter 5. On the external front, the current
account balance has improved over the past
decade, reaching 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014,
much lower than the level of the early 2000s (5.6
percent), and the nominal exchange rate has been
stable at about Q7.8 per US dollar since 2000.
FIGURE 4.3

Economic activity is concentrated in
Guatemala City, creating a large regional disparities. In many countries, the gap between urban
and rural areas in terms of economic development is substantial, and this is certainly the case
in Guatemala. Even more important, however,
are the gaps between the department of
Guatemala, which includes the capital city, and
the rest of the county (figure 4.3). A 2010 study of
regional activity found that per capita GDP in the
Guatemala department was 7.3 times higher than
in the department with the lowest per capita
GDP (Huehuetenango).4 This is far higher than
in, for example, Bolivia (2014), Mexico (2010),
and Peru (2012) where the gap in per capita GDP
between the richest and poorest region is about
4.8, 6.1, and 6.3 times respectively.5 This shows
just how concentrated economic opportunities
are in the department of Guatemala, which
accounts for almost 50 percent of GDP.
Guatemala faces the challenge of not only
increasing its GDP per capita, but also reducing

regional disparities. Differences in GDP per
capita are more striking when analyzed relative to
the United States. In 2010, the GDP per capita of
the department of Guatemala was 12.8 percent of
that of the U.S., about 31 percent below the
average for the Latin America and Caribbean
region. The departments with the lowest GDP
per capita, Huehuetenagno, Quiche, and Alta
Verapaz also have high poverty rates.

Growth Decomposition
What are the drivers behind Guatemala’s
growth performance? This section examines
the contributions made by three elements: (i)
factors of production; (ii) aggregate demand; and
(iii) the supply side.
Factor accumulation (labor and capital) has
been the main driver of GDP growth. As shown
in Figure 4.4, the contribution of labor has been
increasing since the 1960s according to growth
accounting estimates prepared for this report.
This reflects Guatemala’s growing working age
population and high labor force participation rate
rather than increases in labor productivity.6
Labor force participation declined from 67.2
percent in 2000 to 63.3 percent in 2014.
Meanwhile, unemployment is low at about 2
percent of the labor force but is rising, which may
indicate growing pressures in the labor market
(figure 3.1). Between 2010 and 2014, the contribution of labor to growth amounted to 2.7
percentage points, roughly 3.5 times the contribution made by capital. In contrast to labor, the
contribution of capital to growth has declined
over the same period.
Gross capital formation has historically been
low in Guatemala. In 2014, Guatemala’s gross
capital formation was 13.8 percent, the second
lowest in Latin America (after El Salvador) and
the 14th lowest in the world, and well below the
21 percent average for Latin America and the 25
86

percent average for the world (figure 4.4). This
low level of gross capital formation is not new as
back in 1960 Guatemala had the fourth lowest
ratio in the world with 9.8 percent of GDP. These
low levels of investment have not been enough to
accelerate growth and have negatively affected
the productivity and competitiveness of
Guatemalan firms. Estimates suggest that
Guatemala could raise its economic growth by
more than 1 percentage point per year by
increasing its investment-to-GDP ratio up to the
average of Mexico, Peru, and Chile.7
Various factors could be affecting overall
investment levels. For example, Guatemala’s low
savings rate (only 11.6 percent in 2014, the
second lowest in the Latin American region after
El Salvador) does not help to boost investment
levels. According to national account data, public
investment, which averaged 1.9 percent between
2010 and 2014, is constrained by the lack of
public resources as well as by inefficiencies in the
public investment process (see Chapter 5).
Private investment increased from 5.5 percent of
GDP in 1985 to almost 17 percent of GDP in
2006, partly as a result of trade liberalization
policies that attracted foreign direct investment
and of the privatization of the power and
telecommunication sectors. However, private
investment had declined to 13.3 percent of GDP
by 2014, possibly due to shortcomings in the
investment climate, such as contract enforcement
and high transport and logistics costs, in that
limit returns to investment and to a lack of
opportunities, as will be discussed later in this
chapter.
Meanwhile, the contribution of total factor
productivity (TFP) has fluctuated but overall has
been very small. TFP, which captures how
efficiently labor and capital are being used, is
important for boosting living standards. During
the 1960s and 1970s, for example, TFP was a
major contributor to Guatemala’s growth,

boosting real growth rates by an average of 1.9
and 1.4 percentage points per year, in the two
decades respectively. After a decline in TFP in the
1980s due to the intensification of the civil war
and the debt crisis, TFP contributed an average of
0.9 percentage points to growth in the 1990s.
During the 2000s, the contribution of TFP
declined, cutting annual GDP growth by an
average of 0.2 percentage points per year, but this
trend has since reversed, with a marginal increase
in TFP having added around 0.3 percentage
points to annual GDP growth since 2010. The
overall decline in TFP’s contribution to growth is
not unique to Guatemala. Productivity growth
has slowed in most countries in the Latin
American region and in advanced economies
after the global financial crisis.8
On the demand side, private consumption has
been the main contributor to growth in
Guatemala (figure 4.6). Private consumption,
which accounts for over 80 percent of GDP,

contributed on average, 3 percentage points to
GDP growth between 1950 and 2014. This large
share is the result of low levels of private and
public investments. More recently, rising remittances—around 50 percent of which are spent on
consumption—and expanding consumer credit
have fueled an increase in consumption.
Meanwhile, the contribution of exports of goods
and services to growth has been offset by imports
of goods and services. This is explained by
imports amounting to a higher share of GDP
than exports rather than by differences in growth
rates between exports and imports.
On the supply side, the service sector continues to be the main driver of GDP growth. It
accounted for 70 percent of GDP growth between
2010 and 2014, equivalent to 2.5 percentage
points (figure 4.7). Within the service sector,
growth has been particularly strong in the
financial sector, followed by transportation and
commerce. Financial services grew by 8.3 percent

during the 2010 to 2014 period (or 0.4 percentage
points of GDP growth), reflecting the continued
growth in the provision of credit to the private
sector and an expansion of bank branches.
Although the contribution of the financial sector
to overall GDP remains small (4.6 percent in
2014), it more than doubled from 2 percent in
2000. The contributions of agriculture, manufacturing, and construction are smaller because of
the account for a smaller share of total GDP.

As in other countries in the region,
Guatemala’s economic structure has undergone a
structural transformation with the agriculture’s
share in economic output and employment
falling. The share of agriculture in economic
output fell from 32.6 percent in 1950 to 15
percent in 2002 and had dropped further to 14.2
percent by 2014 (figure 4.8). During the same
period, the decline in agriculture employment
has been much slower, from 69 percent to 32

contribution of each sector have implications for
labor productivity. For example, if the bulk of
employment moves from high productivity
sectors to low productivity ones, the overall
productivity of the economy will decline.

some sectors, especially in their use of unskilled
labor and labor productivity.10 Like other
countries with high poverty levels, Guatemala
faces the persistent challenge of creating more
and better remunerated jobs for its population, a
challenge that is compounded by high informal
levels and a fragmented social contract. Firms
and workers are informal either because they are
excluded from state benefits that have limited
coverage or because they opt out because of the
poor quality of public services and enforcement
capability of the government.11 This duality in
economic activity and employment matters
because informal employment is more prevalent
among indigenous groups and rural workers and
tends to yield lower incomes.

A Sector Perspective on
Economic Activity, Job
Creation, and
Informality
It is important to understand the dynamics
of different sectors in order to grasp the links
between economic growth and job creation.
Labor earnings are the main source of income for
the vast majority of people in Guatemala and are
a key driver of poverty reduction.9 Whether
growth contributes to poverty reduction depends
on the labor intensity (relative to their size) of
Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

Job Creation and Informality
Employment growth has followed economic
activity, and the service sector is the main creator
of jobs. The number of jobs grew at an

89

annualized rate of 3.1 percent between 2000 and
2014, while GDP growth averaged 3.5 percent.
About 60 percent of jobs were created in the
service sector (figure 4.10). Manufacturing was a
key contributor to job creation during the 2000
to 2006 period, but its capacity to create jobs
collapsed between 2006 and 2014.12 In contrast,
growth in agricultural employment was minimal
in the first half of the 2000s, but since 2006 it has
contributed 1.2 percentage points to job creation.
This increase in agricultural employment after
2006 is associated with the expansion of land use
for agricultural production by the private sector.
Furthermore, as Guatemala moves along the
structural transformation path, it is expected that
agribusiness (processed) activities will represent
a larger and rising share of GDP as the share of
primary agriculture goes down. Although
Guatemalan agribusiness performs well in
comparison with other regional and global peers,
the sector will need to grow faster to be able to
significantly increase employment.
Guatemala’s private sector creates most jobs,
but few jobs are formal. The public sector
accounts for 5.5 percent of the workforce, which
is very small compared with an average of 10.9
FIGURE 4.10

percent for Latin America in 2012. Informality is
one way to assess the quality of jobs and the
engagement of workers and firms with the
government.13 One of the most popular laborbased definitions of informality is jobs with no
social security. Using that definition, Guatemala
has the second largest informal sector in the
Latin America region. (figure 4.11). Most of the
net jobs created in Guatemala since 2000 are in
the informal sector, mainly in agriculture and
commerce (figure 4.12).
Differences in the extent of informality
between the department of Guatemala and the
rest of country indicate market segmentation.
The main features of formal jobs in the private
sector are: (i) they are geographically concentrated in urban areas (76 percent) and in the
department of Guatemala (51 percent); (ii) they
are offered by large firms (52 percent): (iii) they
are held by workers with some secondary or
tertiary education (83 percent); and (iv) they are
held by people in the top two income quintiles
(83 percent). In contrast, informal jobs tend to
be: (i) located in rural areas (50 percent) and
outside the department of Guatemala (81
percent); (ii) in microenterprises (75 percent);

and (iii) held by workers with no education or
only some primary education (69 percent). With
respect to economic sectors, most formal jobs are
in manufacturing (24 percent), commerce and
hotels/restaurants (25 percent), and financial
intermediation (16 percent). In contrast, informal
jobs are more likely to be in agriculture (38
percent), with only 12 percent in manufacturing.
Median hourly earnings from formal jobs in the
private sector are twice as high as earnings from
informal jobs.
Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs) play an important economic role in
creating jobs. It is estimated that MSMEs employ
79 percent of workers in Guatemala City (in the
department of Guatemala) and 92 percent in the
rest of the country (figure 4.13). At the national
level, the smaller the firm, the greater the degree
of informality, but informal jobs are less common
in Guatemala City than in the rest of the country
for all firm sizes (figure 4.14).
At the firm level, economic activity is concentrated in the department of Guatemala.
According to the 2013 Directory of Registered
Enterprises and Their Branches, most registered
enterprises (62 percent) and the jobs that they

offered (76 percent) were in the department of
Guatemala. Most registered enterprises (those in
the formal sector) were operating in the commerce sector (34.5 percent). The number of
registered manufacturing enterprises is relatively
small (6.6 percent of all registered enterprises).
The majority of registered enterprises are
microenterprises (64 percent) with one to five
employees.
Some large private firms in Guatemala have
been able to expand into foreign markets. The
emergence of “Guate-Latinas” as part of the
process of globalization is one example (box 4.1).
Guatemalan entrepreneurs have expanded
internationally in an effort to diversify their local
exposure. Most of this expansion has been in
search of new markets in neighboring countries
(such as southern Mexico, Honduras, and El
Salvador) rather than to participate in global
value chains.14 This shows that the Guatemalan
private sector can be dynamic and globally
competitive. However, while this is true for some
larger firms, it does not seem to hold true for the
country’s private sector as a whole and its large
number of MSMEs.

Although informality is widespread, there is
scope for firms to enter the formal sector, thus
expanding the tax base and ensuring a level
playing field between firms.15 A 2010 survey of
informal enterprises in Guatemala found that
more than one-quarter of informal business
owners reported that they would like to register
their firms, and many would be willing to pay to
learn how to register. However, a substantial
majority of entrepreneurs in the informal sector
stated that they did not want register their
businesses, citing the associated tax and regulatory burdens as well as exposure to bribery as the
most important reasons for not registering. This
suggests that the prevalence of bribery holds back
the growth of the formal sector both by discouraging existing informal enterprises from registering and by constraining the growth of new formal
sector enterprises. Promoting formalization
could potentially expand the tax base and provide
benefits for the firms themselves, by increasing
their access to financial investment.

92

Financial Sector
Guatemala’s financial sector is dominated by
banks. The supervised financial system comprises
103 financial institutions, including 17 commercial banks, 14 finance companies, and 6 off-shore
companies. Banks and finance companies
account for 83.3 percent and 2.9 percent of the
system’s assets respectively, while the remaining
13.5 percent belong mainly to off-shore companies (8 percent), exchange houses, and insurance
companies. Non-regulated financial institutions
like cooperatives and microfinance institutions
(MFIs) have assets amounting to about 2.6
percent of GDP and cater to about 2 million
clients.16 Guatemala’s banks are profitable, liquid,
well-capitalized, and domestically funded.
Guatemala’s robust financial sector is reflected in
its strong performance in recent years on key
financial soundness indicators. The banking
system appears to be sound with non-performing
loans at 1.3 percent of total credit in December
2015 and a capital adequacy ratio of 14.1 percent.
The domestic banking sector has been subject to

The emergence of “Guate Latinas” has been a result of the process of globalization and illustrates the
strengths of Guatemala’s private sector. The term refers to businesses that have revenues, operations,
and resources that originate from overseas. This phenomenon is not recent but has accelerated in the
past decade. There are several examples of “Guate-Latina” firms.

financial institutions by large Colombian banks.
Moreover, Banco Industrial and Banrural, the
largest and second largest bank respectively, have
expanded into Honduras.

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

The provision of credit to the private sector has
expanded in recent years, but there is scope for
further financial deepening. Guatemala’s financial
depth, measured as the share of private sector
credit to GDP increased from 22 percent in 2001

to 33 percent in 2014 but remains among the
lowest in the Latin American and the Caribbean
region (figure 4.15). Bank credit remains concentrated in the department of Guatemala (69
percent in 2014). As a result, large regional
disparities exist in financial depth by departments. Using 2010 data on GDP per department,
the latest estimates available, the department of
Guatemala’s financial depth (38 percent) was
three times higher than the rest of the countries
(13 percent).
Credit growth in the banking sector has been
uneven across sectors and type of firms. In 2015,
the portfolio of banks remained concentrated in
consumers (32 percent) and the commerce sector
(16 percent). Consumer credit rose by 10 percent
in the period 2010 to 2015, spurred by increased
demand for credit cards. Bank credit in the
manufacturing and agricultural sectors also
expanded faster than other sectors, but they
accounted for only 12 and 6 percent of total bank
credit in 2015, respectively. The banking sector
targets mainly large enterprises, which saw strong

growth and accounted for 55 percent of bank
credit in 2015. SME and microcredit lending have
grown slower, accounting for 10 percent and 2
percent of bank credit in 2015, respectively. The
low levels of SME and microcredit financing
explain the overall still low ratio of credit to GDP
in Guatemala. It is worth noting that the
Guatemalan Congress approved in mid-April
2016 the Microfinance Law which will regulate
the establishment, registration as well as operations including risk management, disclosure of
information and supervision of microfinance
institutions in general. The legal framework is
expected to allow for a sustainable growth of
microfinance lending in the country while
strengthening and consolidating MIFs with
enhanced oversight and more transparency.
Dollarization and anti-money laundering
remains a source of risk for the financial system.
The acceleration of foreign-currency-denominated loans, which accounted for 45 percent of
total outstanding loans in December 2015,
underscores the importance of the government

trafficking as the main threat, but the assessment
also identified other money-laundering threats
such as corruption, tax fraud, human trafficking,
and extortion as medium or low risks. The
assessment identified a need to build the capacity
of judges, prosecutors, and investigators of
financial crimes and to allow them legally to
forfeit the assets of those who commit such
crimes to strengthen their capacity to combat
money laundering. Within the financial system,
the National Risk Assessment highlighted the
financial cooperatives sector, remittances, and
designated non-financial businesses and professions as being most vulnerable to anti-money
laundering risks.

Information Technology and
Information Technology Enabled
Services

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

The information technology and information
technology enabled services (IT-ITES) industry
has been growing at a fast pace and has significant potential to continue to develop. Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO), software development services, smart games, digital content, and
call centers comprise the main types of businesses in this industry. The IT-ITES industry
grew by 15 percent in 2014, which was well above
the world industry average of 1.6 percent, and
employed 39,000 people with service exports of
US$397 million.18 The industry is supported by a
formal IT-BPO association (the Agexport
IT-BPO Commission), innovative spaces
(Campus Tec), and local IT leaders (Studio-C and
Fundación CA).19 Moreover, Guatemala offers
competitive wages for international investors/
clients in the sector, while for the local population wages are well remunerated. One of the main

95

constraints to the growth of the IT-ITES sector is
the lack of skilled/specialized workers.

Energy Sector
Guatemala’s well-functioning electricity sector
has grown significantly over the past five years.
Private capital participation in the generation
sector has also increased over the years.
Electricity distribution is mostly private, with
three distribution companies sharing more than
80 percent of the regulated demand. In
Guatemala, there are 3,750 kilometers of transmission lines owned by four major companies
that provide the service. Guatemala began
expanding its transmission system in 2009, and
the government has a 10-year plan to support
transmission projects awarded to private sector
companies on the basis of public bids using the
lowest annuity as a basis for selecting the winner.
The main challenge for the sector is how to meet
the growing energy demand in the long-term.
The government authorities and distribution
companies are currently planning a bidding
process for nearly 350-400 megawatts in order to
ensure energy supply needs forecasted for 2021.
This will require institutional capacity building
and the preparation of a strategy as well as
addressing deficiencies, especially in transmission given that the National Interconnected
System does not cover the entire country and that
there still are isolated areas and rural systems that
are not connected to the national grid.
In contrast to the well-functioning power
market, the generation of electricity is still highly
dependent on fossil fuels, which exposes the
sector to oil price volatility. The recent drop in oil
prices has dramatically reduced the cost of
energy in Guatemala. While average industrial
tariffs in Guatemala reached US$0.3120 per kWh
in 2013, the highest in Central America, in 2015
the average industrial tariff was US$0.1144 per

96

kWh, the lowest in the region according to the
Latin American Energy Organization.20 This
situation may be reversed if the oil prices increase
again so it is crucial to develop new capacity from
different sources to diversify the generation
matrix. While certain renewable technologies
have already been in place in Guatemala for
several years (primarily geothermal), others, such
as solar and wind, have only recently been
introduced in the country by distribution
companies using long-term Power Purchase
Agreement bids with criteria for renewable
energy. Although renewable technologies
currently account for only a small portion of total
installed generation capacity, these are expected
to grow in the short term. The integration of
these variable energy sources in the power system
is a key challenge for the following years. In
addition to renewable energy, the private sector
installed a coal-fired plant El Jaguar and the
government has signed an agreement with
Mexico to be supplied with natural gas through a
gas pipeline between the two countries, thus
benefitting from low gas prices in the US and
Mexico.

Agriculture Sector
The agriculture and agro-industry sectors have
been key drivers of economic growth via export
expansion.21 With robust growth rates, agriculture contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth
between 2002 and 2014, about the same as the
manufacturing sector. The expansion of agricultural exports, which have doubled since the late
1990, has been the leading force behind positive
sectoral growth rates. Exports of agriculture
products represented 32 percent of the country’s
merchandise export value in 2014, amounting to
US$3.5 billion. Guatemala now has a world
leading export sector that includes sugar, palm
oil, rubber, cardamom, vegetables, and fruits,

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

particularly bananas and melons. Export expansion in large commercial crops such as palm oil,
sugar, and bananas has been the result of a
combination of area expansion and productivity
increases. However, in the case of vegetables and
cardamom, which tend to be produced by
small-scale farmers, the gains have been the
result of area expansion and in these sectors
productivity has either stagnated or decreased.
Although the agriculture export basket has
diversified, traditional exports such as coffee,
sugar, bananas, and cardamom still represent
about 25 percent of total merchandise export
value.
Overall, there have been only very small gains
in labor productivity in the agricultural sector,
which has caused Guatemala to lag behind the
Latin American average. Agricultural workers are
less productive than those in manufacturing and
services. More importantly, labor productivity in
agriculture has been falling behind other Central
American and Latin American countries (figure
4.20). Guatemala has been less successful than
other countries in the region in increasing its

agriculture output and at the same time significantly reducing the number of people involved in
agriculture.
Aggregate increases in overall land productivity have been modest and only in some subsectors, which highlights the dualistic nature of
agriculture production in Guatemala. On the one
side, the sector contains a segment of highly
efficient large commercial producers running
plantations with large plots and competitive
yields (sugar, palm oil, and banana production
covered 21 percent of the cultivated land in
2013). On the other side, there is a large segment
of small-scale commercial and subsistence
agriculture producers (estimated by Guatemala’s
Agricultural Ministry to amount to nearly 0.8
million households), a large proportion of whom
produce low-value and low-input crops (onethird of the planted agricultural area in
Guatemala is used to produce corn and beans).22
Thus, while commercial agriculture crops like
palm oil and sugar have increased their yields to
competitive levels, yields of staple crops like corn
and beans, which are produced by the vast

majority of poor farmers, are stagnating. In the
case of corn, for example, the average yield per
hectare in 2013 was similar to that in 1990. Small
plots, overuse of soils, and a lack of technology
are the main causes of these stagnating yields for
corn and beans. A study that analyzed TFP per
producer typologies (excluding large commercial
plantations) concluded that only those categorized as large producers reported gains in
productivity, while all types of other agricultural
households (infra-subsistence, subsistence,
production surplus, and small commercial)
suffered from declining productivity between
2006 and 2011.23 Low productivity in agriculture,
especially among subsistence farmers, hampers
not only agricultural progress but also overall
economic growth by depressing wages and
lowering internal demand and investments.
Moreover, earnings in the agricultural sector have
also been falling behind other sectors in recent
years (figure 4.21).
The sugar industry is one of Guatemala’s main
sources of foreign currency. Comprised of 13
sugar mills, the industry generates approximately
60,000 full-time jobs, which support around
250,000 people.24 In addition, it generates indirect
FIGURE 4.21

employment for another 300,000 people, of
whom 33,000 are cane harvesters. About 50
percent of production is exported, mainly to
South Korea (23 percent), the United States (11
percent), and Chile (8 percent). With a yield of
12.2 metric tons per hectare, Guatemala’s sugar
industry is the third most productive worldwide,
behind Colombia and Swaziland with 14.6 and
13.9 tons per hectare respectively. This is almost
double the industry’s yield in 1985 (6.4 metric
tons per hectare). Moreover, Guatemala ranks
fourth in terms of sugar exports, has the most
efficient sugar loading terminal in the world
(2,200 metric tons per hour), and has the largest
storage capacity in the Central American region
(431,000 metric tons).25 The country has earned a
reputation for delivering a high quality product
(with 95 to 98 percent polarization)26 and for
fulfilling its commitments. These remarkable
productivity increases in the sugar industry are
the result of investments in research and development and in the adoption of new technologies.
The combined efforts of these investments have
resulted in: (i) improved genetics; (ii) integrated
pest management; and (iii) more efficient
irrigation. However, environmental and social

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

performance are often cited as areas of improvement for the sugar industry.
Palm oil production has emerged as a new
driver of agriculture production, but several
factors hinder its sustainable expansion.
Guatemala is currently the fourteenth largest
producer of palm oil in the world and third in
Central America. The area planted with palm oil
increased from about 30,000 hectares in 2003 to
115,000 hectares in 2013.27 The crop generates
17,000 direct jobs and some 45,000 indirect jobs.
Guatemala yields of palm oil are among the
highest in the world (7 tons per cultivated hectare
compared to a world average of 3 to 4 tons per
cultivated hectare). The majority of crude palm
oil (CPO) produced in Guatemala is sold to
foreign markets, particularly Mexico, but it is also
acquired by the fats and oils industry within
Guatemala, which produces vegetable oil (a food
staple) at a reasonable price, thus contributing to
the country’s food security. Clearly the sustainable expansion of palm oil production is a key
priority for Guatemala, but there are some issues
that need to be addressed to ensure this happens.
Environmental concerns are emerging as a result
of palm oil expansion in Petén and North areas of
the country that could threaten important forest
reserves. Also, in order to support inclusive
development, the labor and social standards of
the sector need to improve. Therefore, the
effective use of land planning and the adoption of
international industry standards will be necessary
to improve the sector’s social and environmental
outcomes. Although in 2013 Guatemalan palm
producers agreed to adopt the international
standards laid out in the RSPO (Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil) Principles and Criteria, the
sector has yet to put them into practice. The
government might also consider creating special
mechanisms for improving land rights and
expanding access to finance to foster the sector’s
growth. Other challenges affecting the
Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

sustainable expansion of the palm oil industry are
as follows: (i) palm oil prices had dropped from
US$800 per ton in 2009 to around US$650 by
June 2015; (ii) palm oil plantations tend to be
located in hurricane-prone zones, resulting in
endemic flooding of farms; and (iii) risks
associated with land-holding rights have been a
source of uncertainty to expand the total planted
area.
While coffee accounts for only 3 percent of
GDP in Guatemala, the sector generates an
estimated 500,000 jobs.28 It employs almost 9
percent of the active labor force and accounts for
11 percent of Guatemalan exports. The value of
coffee exports grew by an average annual rate of
9.6 percent between 2002 and 2013. Exports
gains have mainly been due to a shift in the
market in the early 2000s towards the specialty
segment. It is estimated that the area under
production has remained relatively stable at
around 260,000 hectares. A large majority of the
coffee producers are smallholders (70,000
producers have less than 0.7 hectares). Seven out
of every ten households in coffee-producing
regions live in poverty, and two out of ten live in
extreme poverty. Coffee accounts for over
two-thirds of agricultural production in the 50
municipalities that have very high levels of
extreme poverty. Over the last decade, coffee
yields have stagnated in Guatemala,29 lagging
behind those of Colombia and Brazil, which are
both major coffee exporters. A lack of investment
in variety development and new technologies as
well as a lack of proper management has constrained productivity improvements in
Guatemala with some plantations having not
been renovated since the 1980s. The coffee sector
remains highly vulnerable both to shifts in
international prices and to exogenous shocks to
production including climate and disease risks
(such as Roya or coffee leaf rust). Reducing the
vulnerability of the sector and increasing
99

productivity will require considerable investments in R&D and extension services. For
example, introducing varieties that are resistant
to the coffee leaf rust would significantly increase
productivity in the sector and reduce its vulnerability, but in Guatemala, unlike in Honduras and
Colombia, the lack of long-term investment in
R&D has limited varietal improvements.
Guatemala has also been able to diversify its
agriculture production base and exports by
expanding into high-value food and agriculture
production and exports such as spices, fruits, and
vegetables. Cardamom emerged as an important
export commodity in the 1990s. By 2009 its
export value had reached US$304 million but
subsequently declined to US$240 million in 2014
as a result of pest outbreaks and declining
international prices. Nevertheless, Guatemala
remains one of the biggest exporters of cardamom, holding some 67 percent of the global
market. Alta Verapaz, one of the poorest departments in Guatemala, produces 70 percent of total
cardamom exports, with about 350,000 smallscale producers involved in cardamom production. The country’s fruit exports are dominated
by bananas (a traditional sector) and melons. In
the vegetable sector, which mainly consists of
small-scale producers, exports grew from US$86
million in 2002 to US$220 million in 2013. The
fruit and vegetable processed sector in particular
has grown remarkably in the last few years, with
average annual growth of 14 percent for processed fruits and 6.6 percent for proceeded
vegetables between 2010 and 2013. A constraint
for export-oriented agribusiness is the poor,
costly, and inefficient ports infrastructure on the
Atlantic coast, the main departure point for
exports to the eastern US. This translates into a
lack of competitiveness for local and multinational firms in the sector, particularly with regard
to fruits and vegetables.

100

The refusal rate of Guatemalan products at the
US border is among the highest among Latin
American exporters of fresh products. Clearly,
phytosanitary and sanitary issues are main
constraints to production and export expansion.
Examples of phytosanitary issues are the recent
outbreaks of Thrips (black insect) in cardamom
production and Roya (leaf rush) in coffee.
Pesticide residue is the most common sanitary
issue facing exporters of fruit and vegetables,
accounting for 44 percent of the refusals received
by Guatemalan fruit and vegetable exporters to
the U.S. Besides pesticides, the other problems
cited in the refusals received by Guatemalan
exporters were inaccurate labeling (29 percent),
product adulterations (12 percent) and poor
hygienic conditions (6 percent).30 Although the
government has been encouraging producers and
enterprises to adopt quality and food safety
management systems, it will be necessary to
introduce incentives for producers through their
relationship with exporters, and to strengthen the
certification and inspection services and regulatory frameworks. This is particularly relevant
given that new changes to the U.S. Food Safety
Modernization Law are imposing new requirements on foreign suppliers.
The current pattern of growth in the agriculture sector is environmentally unsustainable. The
duality that characterizes the agriculture sector in
Guatemala is, to some extent, structural given
existing disparities in access to assets and services
(for example, 8 percent of producers account for
92 percent of the productive land). Therefore,
reducing those disparities is critical.
Furthermore, agricultural growth has been
driven by crop substitution (from annuals to
perennials) but also by a cycle that has involved
cutting down forests to establish extensive
livestock systems and then changing from
livestock to crop production. Furthermore,
livestock and large commercial production are
Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

increasingly being practiced in fragile ecosystems, while the expansion of subsistence agriculture has cause land overuse and soil erosion.
Therefore, given that the potential for expanding
production areas in Guatemala is limited,
ensuring the sustainable intensification of
production in the sector is critical. Moreover, the
lack of a strong framework to deal with sanitary
and phytosanitary issues, including making
relevant investments in R&D, is a major constraint to expanding exports.
There is a need for a strategy to promote the
sustained, sustainable, and inclusive growth of
the agricultural sector. Given the growing
competition among agricultural crops and
activities, land and territorial planning need to be
key pillars of such a strategy. The over-exploitation of workers and the use of child labor are
growing concerns related to the expansion of
plantation crops in Guatemala, so another key
pillar must be improving labor conditions in
export agriculture. Because the disastrous effects
of pests and diseases as well as climate variability
(and climate change patterns) are major obstacles
to sustained agricultural growth, reducing the
vulnerability of the sector also needs to be at the
core of any growth strategy. A final key pillar
should be increasing smallholder productivity
and expanding opportunities to adopt high-value-added production.

Manufacturing and Construction
Sector
The manufacturing sector is small is Guatemala.
Its share of GDP declined from 19.2 percent in
2002 to 17.7 percent in 2014 because it has been
growing more slowly than other sectors of the
economy. Manufacturing has contributed 0.6
percentage points to GDP growth since 2010,
with food and beverages and textile production
leading the sector. Manufacturing products

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

accounted for 50 percent of Guatemala’s merchandise exports in 2014, but this share was
substantially lower than in 2002 (67.4 percent).
Clothing exports to the United States rose to
their highest level in 2004 when they exceeded
US$1.5 billion, but they have declined in recent
years in large part because in 2005 the U.S.
removed quotas on textile imports from Asian
countries where labor costs are significantly
lower than in Guatemala.
The construction sector is underdeveloped,
which explain its limited contribution to job
creation. It accounts for a small share of GDP
(2.8 percent), contributes about 0.1 percentage
points to growth, and is underdeveloped compared to the Central American average.31 This
underdevelopment can partly be attributed to low
public infrastructure spending, the lack of a
functioning framework for public-private
partnerships to attract and mobilize private
sector financing, and partly to a weak residential
market due to low incomes.

Tourism
The tourism industry is small, but has lot
potential. In 2014, almost 1.6 million of tourists
visited the country. Relative to its population, the
number of tourists is about 10 percent, well
below Costa Rica (50 percent) or the Dominican
Republic (38 percent). Guatemala ranked 16th in
the region and 80th overall according to the
Travel and Tourism Competitive Index. The
tourism industry’s direct share in GDP was 3.4
percent in 2014 (the indirect share was 8.8
percent), and it contributed directly to 2.9
percent of total employment (indirectly, it
contributed 7.9 percent).32 With revenues
amounting to 15 percent of merchandise exports
in 2013, the tourism industry is one of
Guatemala’s main source of foreign exchange.
The country possesses many attributes for

101

tourists, including Maya ruins, protected areas
(29.8 percent of the country), volcanos, wide
topographic diversity, and pleasant climate.
Despite its attractive attributes, Guatemala has
not fully capitalized on its tourism potential,
partly attributed to high levels of crime and
violence as well as constraints in the institutional
support to advocate and promote the sector.

Foreign Direct
Investment
Guatemala has a long tradition of attracting foreign direct investment, which has contributed to the development of certain industries.
The country was one of the pioneers in attracting
FDI with the initial development of coffee
production in the late 1800s and of bananas in
the early 1900s.33 After the 1996 Peace Accord,
the privatization of state-owned enterprises
(electricity and telecommunications) accelerated
the inflow of FDI, which was also directed
towards other sectors such as food and beverages,
textiles, retail, and mining. Other than trade
agreements, legislative and institutional changes
contributed to the increase in FDI such as: (i) the
adoption of the 1998 investment law; (ii) the
1997 enactment of the Mineral Law established
more favorable conditions for foreign investment,
and as a result the number of exploration and
exploitation licenses increased dramatically;34
(iii) the liberalization of the exchange rate in
2001; (iv) the creation of the agency “Invest in
Guatemala” in 2004; and (v) the creation of the
National Competitiveness Program in 2004.
Nevertheless, Guatemala’s FDI flows are
among the lowest in Central America. FDI
inflows into Guatemala almost doubled between
2007 and 2014 (figure 4.23), reaching 2.2 percent
of GDP in 2014. However, they are still lower
than the flows into other Central American

102

countries like Nicaragua (7.1 percent), Honduras
(5.8 percent), Costa Rica (4.7 percent), and
Panama (10.2 percent). Preliminary data as of
September 2015 show that FDI inflows shrunk by
20.2 percent compared to the same period in
2014, which can be attributed partly to various
political scandals in 2015.
The impact of FDI on the composition of
exports and the economy varies depending on
the type of investment involved. In Guatemala,
the composition of FDI inflows have gradually
shifted from primary sectors such as agriculture,
petroleum, and mining to non-tradable sectors,
such as electricity, banking and insurance, and
commerce (figure 4.24). Business processing
(BPO), call centers, and other niche industries
(such as the production of ornamental plants)
have all flourished by relying on FDI. In general,
the impact of FDI on the development of the
manufacturing sector is difficult to quantity.
However, Honduras is an interesting example of
how attracting efficiency-seeking FDI has
jumpstarted the light manufacturing sector,
particularly insulated wire for cars.35

Exports
Trade policies have long been at the center of
Guatemala’s development strategy. In the 1960s,
Guatemala was one of the original members of
the Central American Common Market
(CACM), which contributed to the creation of an
industrial base and promoted regional trade.
Since the mid-1980s, substantial progress has
been made in Guatemala in reducing tariff rates
and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and removing
export licenses and taxes.36 In the mid-1990s, the
government deregulated and liberalized the
financial, power, and telecommunication sectors
and has more recently given tax and duty
exemptions to maquilas and non-traditional
exports. Guatemala became a member of GATT

trade openness increased by 19 percentage points
between 1960 (27.2 percent) and 1999 (46.4
percent). As shown in Figure 4.25, between 2001
and 2014, trade openness in Guatemala declined
by 13 percentage points, reaching 56.3 percent.
Guatemala’s progress in increasing trade flows is
poor in comparison to other Central America
countries, which have substantially increased
their trade openness during the same period.
Both exports and imports have contributed to
this decline in Guatemala’s trade flows. In terms
of per capita merchandise exports, another
indicator of trade openness, Guatemala is also
lagging behind other Central American countries
(figure 4.26). To facilitate trade, the government
initiated a project to integrate Guatemala’s
customs and other border agency procedures
with those of Honduras.
Merchandise exports have diversified in terms
of products, and Guatemala now has the most
varied basket in Central America. The number of
its export products increased from 1,952 to 3,272
between 1994 and 2014, currently the highest in
the region (figure 4.27). Product diversification
can be traced back to two main causes: (i) the

decline of apparel and textile exports after the
end of the WTO’s Agreement on Textiles and
Clothing in 2005 and (ii) the start of important
mining projects in the mid-2000s that increased
the exports of precious metals like gold and silver
and lately of industrial minerals like zinc, lead,
and nickel. In terms of markets, Guatemala now
exports its goods to 142 distinct markets, up
from 92 in 1994. Export diversification has
softened the impact of the global economic crisis
on exports from Guatemala.37
However, product diversification has not
boosted export sophistication. The complexity of
the Guatemalan export basket has remained
stagnant over the last two decades while other
countries in the region have increased the
sophistication of their export baskets (figure
4.28). Three agricultural products (coffee,
bananas, and sugar) accounted for 21.6 percent of
Guatemala’s exports in 2014, up from 17.9
percent in 2005 (table 4.1). Efforts to diversify its
exports of non-traditional products has focused
on fresh, frozen, and processed fruit and vegetables and on flowers, seeds, and ornamental plants
to the U.S. and European markets. Growth of

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

Underlying Constraints
on Inclusive Growth
For many years private firms have reported
experiencing obstacles within the investment
climate that have negatively affected their
productivity. The World Economic Forum, which
carries out yearly surveys to construct its index of
global competitiveness, asks business executives

105

to identify the most problematic factors that
hinder doing business. About half of the firms in
Guatemala identified governance (crime and
theft, corruption, and an inefficient public sector)
followed by the low quality of the labor supply as
the main constraints that they faced (figure 4.29).
The World Bank Enterprise Survey for Guatemala
for 2010, the latest year available, found that
enterprises reported the top five problem areas as
crime and theft (21 percent), practices in the
informal sector (19 percent), political instability
(16 percent), and corruption (11 percent). These
constraints in the investment climate have
harmful effects on firms’ productivity. Using
objective indicators of these constraints, a 2009
study found that improvements in regulatory
compliance and governance indicators (proxied
by crime and security statistics and the incidence
of bribes) would have the largest positive effect
on firm-level productivity.38
Guatemala’s growth constraints are not new.
Comprehensive growth reports for the past 30
years have consistently identified the same
constraints: low endowments of human capital,
low investment levels, inadequate infrastructure,
weak institutions, and limited access to finance.39

A similar set of challenges was identified in the
1951 World Bank report about Guatemala’s
economic development (box 1.1). Although
Guatemala scores well in the latest Global
Competitiveness Report from the World
Economic Forum for its macroeconomic
environment, financial market development, and
business sophistication, it got low scores in the
areas of institutions, health, and education.
Institutional challenges in Guatemala are
discussed in Chapter 5.
The combination of low human capital and
investment with weak institutions has resulted in
rates of economic growth that are not enough to
reduce poverty levels. Having low revenues
relatively to its GDP, Guatemala has not been able
to increase its historically low endowments of
human capital. Moreover, public investment is
too small to be able to attract private investment
to address infrastructure shortcomings. Weak
institutions have resulted in weak rule of law,
widespread corruption, and high levels of crime
and violence. Ultimately, policy inertia and the
lack of a coherent growth strategy reduce the
impact of public policies.40 Addressing these
issues will be crucial in order to enhance growth
and prosperity for Guatemala’s citizens.

A Large Education Deficit
Guatemala’s education performance is poor,
which means that it lags behind its peer countries
in terms of competitiveness. The only gains
produced by the government’s low levels of
investment in education have been in terms of
primary school completion. Indeed, between
2000 and 2014, the share of adults (those who are
at least 25 years old) that had at least a complete
primary education increased from 30 percent to
43 percent (figure 4.30). As shown in Figure 4.32,
dropout rates are quite high in Guatemala
compared to other countries. In 2010, only about

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

18 percent of Guatemalans in the 25 to 29 age
group had completed secondary education, well
below Honduras (30 percent) and the Latin
American average (51 percent). Returns to
education in Guatemala are high but declining,
suggesting either an excess labor supply or low
labor demand for the skills being produced in the
school system (figure 4.31).
Low educational attainment, the limited supply
of skilled labor, and the low quality of education
will hinder productivity and the transition to
high-value added sectors in Guatemala. The lack
of an educated workforce affects firms’ productivity in different ways. Low levels and the poor
quality of education make it more difficult for
workers to use their existing physical capital
efficiently and to adapt to new technologies
quickly. An inadequately educated workforce
hinders technical progress and, thus, productivity
growth, and curtails the economy’s capacity to
develop high-value added sectors. Moreover, the
inadequacy of education prevents the majority of
the population from accessing better paid jobs,

especially those from indigenous communities.
According to a World Bank analysis of small and
medium-sized enterprises in Guatemala, only 10
percent of their owners had attended tertiary
school and fewer than 50 percent had been
enrolled in secondary school. In addition, only 3
percent of their permanent employees had
received a higher education, while 46 percent had
only primary and secondary schooling.41

FIGURE 4.30 Gains in Primary Education

are High, but Declining

Infrastructure Gap
Coverage of roads and electricity is modest in
Guatemala compared with coverage in its
structural peers. In terms of road density,
Guatemala ranks better than Honduras but worse
than Nicaragua and Panama (figure 4.33a). Only
89.6 percent of dwellings are attached to the
electricity grid, the fifth lowest percentage in the
Latin America region, though this has improved
in recent years (figure 4.33b). Nevertheless, wide
disparities exist between rural and urban areas
and across departments. For example, dwellings
in the department of Guatemala have almost

universal coverage (99.5 percent) whereas in Alta
Verapaz only 43.5 percent have access to electricity.42 Besides lowering standards of living, the
lack of access to electricity also affects employment opportunities by hindering firms’
productivity.
The quality of infrastructure in Guatemala has
deteriorated in recent years. Figure 4.34a presents
the World Economic Forum Index on the overall
quality of infrastructure, which shows that
Guatemala has the highest ranking among all of
its structural peers. However, the quality of its
infrastructure has worsened in recent years in all
sectors, especially in roads, ports, and airports
(figure 4.34b). The electricity supply is the only
kind of infrastructure that has improved and
significantly grown, but there are significant rural
areas, particularly in the northern part of the
country, that are still not connected to the
national grid.
In terms of transport and logistics, Guatemala
faces high costs that negatively affect its competitiveness and reduce gains from trade. A recent
analysis of four logistics corridors estimated costs
ranging from 6.4 to 11.4 percent of the value of
108

the goods being transported.43 The main factors
that contribute to these high costs are: (i)
inefficient and costly road freight services largely
due to a lack of competition and to obstacles to
more flexible freight allocation; (ii) deficient and
costly seaport operations and infrastructure; (iii)
costly document and goods processing, including
delays at borders (both ports and inland border
crossings); (iv) urban congestion in Guatemala
City; and (v) poor road conditions, particularly
secondary and tertiary networks, due in part to
poor maintenance.
The infrastructure deficit raises concerns about
the adequacy of current levels of infrastructure
spending and the existing implementation
capacity for infrastructure projects. Guatemala
stands out among Latin America countries for its
low levels of infrastructure investment at only 1.6
percent of GDP (figure 4.35a). Public infrastructure spending (figure 4.35b) has declined because
capital expenditures have reached a historic low
in recent years and are not sufficient to support
sustained growth and meet the country’s needs.
Estimates suggest that Guatemala could increase
growth by over 1 percentage point by increasing
Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

its investment-to-GDP ratio to the level of the
average for Mexico, Peru, and Chile.44
Infrastructure investment spiked in 2007 and
2010 due to private investments in the telecommunications and energy sectors respectively
(figure 4.35b).
Capital expenditure is currently concentrated
on community development and transport. The
vast bulk of public investment is allocated to the
budget lines of community development (both
FIGURE 4.33

urban and rural, including local transport) and
road transport, which together account for about
80 percent of the total capital expenditures.
While the bulk of public investment was traditionally allocated to and handled by the central
government, in the last 10 years capital transfers
to other public sector entities (including regional
development councils and municipalities) have
accounted for more than half of all public
investment.

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

109

Infrastructure spending has decreased despite
high investment needs. Guatemala has relatively
limited road infrastructure coverage, and its
electricity coverage ranks among the lowest in
Latin America. Furthermore, Guatemala’s quality
of infrastructure, as measured by the World
Economic Forum’s competitiveness index,
deteriorated between 2010 and 2015. Frequent
natural disasters have inflicted additional damage
to the country’s infrastructure, further adding to
the financial strains. For example, the series of
disasters of 2010 (in Agatha and Pacaya) caused
an estimated US$305 million (0.74 percent of
GDP) in damages in the transport sector alone.
In light of this, the reduction by half of public
investment in road transport from 1.8 percent of
GDP in 2011 to 0.9 percent in 2014 is of concern,
especially considering that this is not compensated for by private sector investment.45
It might be possible to increase investment in
infrastructure through the use of public-private
partnerships (PPPs) without placing greater
pressure on public financing. In 2013, the
government established the National Agency for
the Development of Partnerships in

FIGURE 4.35

Infrastructure (ANADIE) to boost investment
levels through public-private partnerships.
ANADIE has identified seven projects costing
more than US$1.3 billion, including a government center (US$180 million), the Tecum Uman
Port (US$40 million), the Pacific Train (US$250
million), solid waste projects (US$75 million), a
north-south road (US$220 million), and an
urban train (US$420 million). However, so far
progress has been made on only one of these
projects.46 Another concern is that public-private
partnerships need to be assessed and regulated,
for example, to ensure that PPP tenders are
awarded transparently and that contract terms
are effectively specified and regulated, and this
will require further investment. Legal certainty
and respect for rule of law is also a matter of
concern for domestic and foreign investors. The
PPP agenda needs to fact in these elements to
ensure successful promotion of projects.

Crime and Violence
Crime and violence are among the main challenges to growth in Guatemala. For the past 10
years, it has ranked at the top obstacle to business

operations reported by business executives
(figure 4.29). Although Guatemala’s homicide
rate has declined since 2008, in 2015 the homicide rate increased slightly to 33.8 from 31.2 in
2014 (figure 4.37).47 This homicide level is well
above the average for all Latin America (around
25 per 100,000 inhabitants). High robbery
victimization, increased incidence of sexually
related crimes, kidnappings, and, violence-related
injuries have also contributed to the strong
perceptions of insecurity among citizens.48
Crime and violence affect specific geographic
areas disproportionately. Over 39 percent of
national homicides49 between 2003 and 2013
were reported to have occurred within the
metropolitan area of the Department of
Guatemala, which represents about 17 percent of
the population50. Other regions with the highest
homicides rates, such as Izabal, Chiquimula, El
Petén, Zacapa, and Jutiapa, are located along the
borders with El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and
Belize.51 Because these areas are part of transshipment routes for drug trafficking, this is suggestive
of a possible link between high homicide rates
and organized crime.52
High levels of crime and violence increase the
costs of doing business and lower returns to
investment. The economic costs of these crimes
are high and rising – an estimated 7.7 percent
GDP in 2011,53 11.3 percent GDP in 2013,54 and
10 percent of GDP in 2014.55 These high costs
hinder competitiveness and reduce profit
margins and can make the difference between
whether a firm survives or fails. The public’s lack
of confidence in the police has meant that private
security personnel now outnumber the police
force. The 2010 World Bank Enterprise Surveys
showed that on average 70 percent of Guatemalan
firms pay for their own private security, spending
about 1.9 percent of their yearly sales on average.
In addition to such direct costs, crime and
violence affect the opportunities and incentives

for firms to invest, create jobs, and expand.56
Productivity is hampered by absenteeism or by
the need to limit working hours for workers who
are concerned about their personal security.
Furthermore, crime and violence also could also
reduce returns to education, discouraging
individuals to pursue higher levels of education
and thus reducing the pool of skilled labor.
Finally, high security costs may be deterring
foreign firms from establishing operations in
Guatemala or are inducing them to leave to
resettle in countries with less crime and violence.

Business Regulations and
Competition
Business regulations and competition policy
influences growth by facilitating private sector
participation in the economy.57 One of the
government’s key functions is to approve and
implement sound policies and regulations that
will foster private sector development. Moreover,
through business and market regulations and a
commitment to enforcing property rights and
111

contracts, state institutions can affect returns to
investment and thus how private firms behave.
This section reviews some current aspects of
Guatemala’s state institutions that appear to be
hindering private sector activities, including poor
business regulations and lack of competition.
The ease of doing business also influences the
competitiveness of the economy and investment
decisions of private firms. Guatemala’s ranks
quite high in the World Bank’s 2015-2016 Doing
Business Index - 81th out of 189 countries (figure
4.38a). This is probably because the government
has recently implemented some innovative IT
solutions to reduce red tape and modernize the
interface between the public administration and
the final users, especially in the areas of tax
payments, customs, and property registration.58
These modernization efforts should be extended
to other areas of business regulations to facilitate
investment and increase firms’ productivity.
Guatemala’s lower ranking on specific indicators
related to the protection of minority investors,
contract enforcement, resolving insolvency, and
dealing with construction permits indicate

priority areas that need to be reformed (figure
4.38b).59
Guatemala lacks both a clear competition
policy and a competition authority to address
anticompetitive behavior and high market
concentrations.60 Without neither a competition
law nor an independent competition authority,
Guatemala is one of the few countries in Latin
America that does not have a competition regime
in place. Although the Guatemalan Constitution
includes a provision that forbids monopolies, this
provision has not been implemented in practice.
Likewise, despite the fact that both the Law of
Hydrocarbons and the Electricity Law include
competition provisions, the government has not
enforced them or sanctioned any uncompetitive
practices. Guatemala also currently lacks a
merger control regime for both general application and for regulated sectors.61 However, as part
of its commitments under the Association
Agreement between Central America and the
European Union, Guatemala has agreed to enact
a competition law by November 2016.62
Examples of restrictive business practices can
be found in various sectors of the economy.63 In
the sugar sector, one company holds a monopoly
on the distribution of sugar and thus sets the
prices for the consumers. There are dominant
suppliers of construction materials (cement, steel,
and bitumen), canned beans production, and
poultry production. In the road freight service,
for example, the lack of competition results in an
almost 100 percent markup in freight prices per
ton-kilometer.64

Remittances and Exchange
Appreciation
As in El Salvador and Honduras, high migration
rates and resulting remittances may be reinforcing low growth in Guatemala in several ways.65
First, remittances can contribute to the “Dutch

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

KNOWLEDGE GAP 2.1 What’s the full cost of crime to the Guatemalan
Economy?
Guatemala, like other countries in the Northern Triangle, is showing signs of increasing gang
violence and extortions, and associated closure of business activities. Firms report that extortion
demands could range between US$45 to $5,000 per month. Both formal and informal firms are
equally affected. Dealing with crime and violence could represent between 8 to 15 percent of
business costs. Although there are not statistics about number of business closures due to extortions, the question arises of the consequences on entrepreneurial activities and labor incomes.

disease” effect because capital inflows can cause
real exchange rate appreciation. A rise in household income as a result of the inflow of remittances leads to an increase in consumer demand,
which raises prices for domestic non-tradables,
prompting a reallocation of labor away from the
tradable goods and real exchange rate appreciation. Second, migration has directly reduces the
size of the labor force, but it may also indirectly
influence the labor market participation of those
left behind by increasing reservation wages. The
real exchange rate has appreciated by 30 percent
since 2003, which is detrimental for
competitiveness.66

Financial Inclusion
Guatemala saw rapid growth in account ownership, but the gap between the poorest and richest
households increased. According to the World
Bank Financial Inclusion database (Findex), 41
percent of adults has an account with a financial
institution in 2014, up from 22 percent in 2011.
Guatemala’s account ownership is still below
countries in the Latin America and Caribbean
region (51 percent of adults), although above El
Salvador (35 percent), Honduras (30 percent),
and Nicaragua (19 percent). Large disparities
exist in account ownership, as 27 percent of those

households. In contrast with the regional average,
the gap between adults living in the poorest and
the richest households widened from 16 percentage points in 2011 to 23 percentage points in
2014.
Access to loans from financial institutions
remains limited like in the rest of Latin America
and the Caribbean region. The recent Findex
survey finds that only 12 percent of adults
borrowed from a financial institutions in 2014,
down from 14 percent in 2011 (figure 4.39). For
poorest individuals, only seven percent borrowed
from a financial institution, below 16 percent
among the richest one. Family and friends
remain the first source of financing for
Guatemalan adults (20 percent).
The dearth of financing instruments, particularly loans, suitable for small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and micro-entrepreneurs
constrains firm investment and growth. About
one third of Guatemalan (SME) are credit
constraint (rejected by financial institutions or
self-excluded due to inadequate products by
financial institutions) in Guatemala, among the
highest levels in the Latin America and the

Caribbean region.67 Furthermore, when banks are
used to finance investments, Guatemalan SMEs
reported bank financing covered between 15 to
25 percent of total investment, among the lowest
in the region (figure 4.40). Besides the limited use
of bank financing, Guatemalan firms are also not
using leasing or factoring to finance their need
for investment or working capital. Leasing and
factoring represent less than 0.1 percent of
banking credit. Seed capital instruments are
almost inexistent in Guatemala. Only one private
equity fund for MSMEs operates in the country
and only five equity incubators. Firms rarely use
their movable assets as collateral because of the
114

cumbersome and expensive registration procedures required to do so. The lack of eligible
collateral and efficient credit information results
in firms being granted low value loans, thus
preventing them from growing into more
sustainable businesses. Banrural, a state-owned
development bank, is the main provider of
financial services to SMEs and to indigenous
populations (box 4.2).
A stronger regulatory and supervisory
framework for microfinance institutions (MFIs)
and financial cooperatives would ensure sound
growth and facilitate the consolidation of supply.
For financial cooperatives, this is particularly

urgent as they hold the deposits of 10 percent of
the population. For MFIs, an appropriate
regulatory framework would help them to grow
by allowing the largest MFIs to take deposits as
well as ensuring adequate consumer protection.
Improving the regulatory and supervisory
framework for financial consumer protection
would protect the most vulnerable from becoming over-indebted when they apply for a loan.
Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

Recent research undertaken by the World Bank
on the current financial services market in
Guatemala found a lack of transparency (poor
disclosure of total costs and the existence of
hidden fees), unfair practices (collecting twice on
the same loans and seizing property without a
court ruling), and weak redress mechanisms for
consumers.

BOX 4.2 The Case of Banrural, Guatemala
Banrural S.A. was created in 1998 as the result of the restructuring of the Guatemalan National
Agricultural Development Bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agrícola or Bandesa). The process of
transforming Bandesa into Banrural was part of the modernization process of the Guatemalan
financial system approved by the Guatemalan Congress in 1997. Banrural was conceived as a joint
public-private venture with 30 percent of its capital provided by the state and 70 percent by the private
sector. The mixed ownership structure was designed to facilitate the active participation of civil society
groups involved in the rural sector with a strong social commitment. Banrural’s private shareholders
include community groups, cooperatives, and organizations. It holds the accounts of all government
employees and manages all public trust funds.
As of December 2015, Banrural was the second largest bank in Guatemala in terms of assets (valued at
US$6.9 billion). The bank relies on an extensive network of almost 1,000 branches and 2,174 agents to
serve a loan portfolio of US$4.3 billion, equivalent to 21.3 percent of the Guatemalan banking system.
At the end of 2014, Banrural started operations in Honduras, and as a result of the forced liquidation
of Banco Continental in Honudras, it purchased assets estimated at US$225 million.
Banrural aims to foster economic activity in rural areas of the country in a way that is profitable and
sustainable for its shareholders, while maintaining a development objective with an entrepreneurial
vision. It offers a diverse array of financial products and has a special focus on indigenous populations.
Microenterprise credit, corporate credit, second-tier lending, and international operations as well as a
number of payment services (water, electricity, and telephone) are all part of its portfolio. First-tier
lending is provided by a specialized microfinance unit, which is responsible for providing loans to
individuals or to groups (e.g., solidarity groups, or communal banks). Other loans are tailored to small
and medium-sized farmers, consumers, and housing renovations and expansions. Larger corporations, which are not target clients for the bank, are also venturing into this sector with the aim of
increasing their profitability.

47 There is no conclusive argument regarding the decline
in homicide rates in Guatemala over the last five years.
However, the Government of Guatemala claims that a
combination of crime control measures, including the
deployment of task forces involving joint military and
police actions to areas with high concentration of crime
has helped to reduce violence associated with competition among criminal gangs over territory, particularly in
poor urban neighborhoods.

cies make economy-wide interventions to promote open,
transparent, and dynamic markets that serve consumers
and improve the business environment. Competition
agencies directly focus on tackling anticompetitive
behavior by firms and encourage them to adhere to the
competition law through a deterrent effect and, more
positively, through effective advocacy. Several studies
show that the effective application of competition policy
can lead to productivity increases and price reductions
in key input sectors, thus to boosting GDP growth in the
short to medium term.
Moving forward, it will be critical to ensure that the new
Guatemalan Competition Law includes the provisions to
set up of a competition agency able to effectively tackle
anticompetitive behavior and regulations that unduly
restrict competition.

Trends and Drivers of Growth in Guatemala

5. Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth,
Distribution, and Poverty Reduction
Despite its macroeconomic stability, Guatemala has experienced low GDP per capita growth, and this growth has
not translated into economic and social gains for the vast majority of the population. The severe disparities in
economic and social outcomes between the “two Guatemalas” is hindering Guatemala’s path for inclusive growth.
Several factors are getting in the way of efforts to reduce poverty and foster sustained inclusive growth, including
Guatemala’s small public sector for the size of the economy paired with limited capacity to provide public goods,
weak governance, high levels of crime and violence, growing urbanization, and exposure to natural disasters.
However, as a result of social and economic pressures, demand is growing for greater provision of public goods
such as education, health care and public infrastructure, and momentum is building behind efforts to seize the
opportunities presented by Guatemala’s upcoming demographic dividend.

Fiscal Sustainability
A low tax burden is one of the main constraints for promoting development in Guatemala.1 As early as 1950, Guatemala had the lowest
tax revenue as a percentage of GDP in Central
America (6.67 percent),2 a ranking that continues today. In 2014, tax revenue as a share of
GDP reached 10.8 percent, which was still well
below most countries in the Latin American and
the Caribbean (figure 5.1). Guatemala has no
significant non-tax revenue sources in contrast
with other countries with low tax-to-GDP ratios
like Mexico and Panama.3 This concentration on
taxes as a source of revenues (94 percent of total
government revenues in 2014) makes Guatemala’s economy vulnerable to economic shocks. Another consequence of the low tax burden is that
the government has a limited amount to spend
on the provision of public goods and services.
While both tax revenues and expenditures
have increased since the 1996 Peace Accords, the
outcomes have been much weaker than was
foreseen in the agreements. The Peace Accords
called for the state to take a stronger role in

neglected areas and for increased expenditure,
especially on education, health, housing and
justice, to be financed by a gradual increase in tax
revenues. Even without overhauling its tax
system and despite a gradual decline in import
tariffs resulting from trade liberalization and
regional integration, Guatemala was able to raise
its tax revenues by implementing incremental tax
policy measures and improving tax administration. The tax-to-GDP ratio increased from 8.8
percent of GDP in 1995 to over 12 percent in the
mid-2000s but has since fallen back to 10.8
percent in 2014. This increase in revenues was
accompanied by an expansion in spending to
meet the commitments of the Peace Accords.
Total central government expenditure increased
from 10.3 percent of GDP to 13.4 percent in the
same period (figure 5.2), with the social sectors
accounting for a significant share of this increase.
Guatemala’s public finances have focused on
fiscal discipline and low debt levels. In response
to the crisis of the early 1980s when the overall
fiscal deficit averaged 4.9 percent of GDP
(between 1981 and 1984), the government
implemented a comprehensive adjustment

program to promote fiscal consolidation in the
early 1990s.4 Thereafter, the overall fiscal deficit
fell to 1.7 percent in the 2000 to 2007 period. The
2009 global financial crisis negatively affected
government finances due to lower tax collection
and counter-cyclical spending.5 The overall
deficit peaked at 3.3 percent in 2010, and since
then it has gradually declined as a result of
expenditure controls (figure 5.3). As in the past,
fiscal consolidation has been achieved by
reducing the already low levels of public expenditures on infrastructure and human capital.
Capital expenditures declined from 4.1 percent of
GDP in 2010 to 3 percent in 2014 and are
projected to decline to 2.5 percent of GDP in
2016.6 Public debt has ranged between 20 and 25
percent of GDP since 2000, with almost half of
that debt held domestically (figure 5.4). However,
public debt relative to tax revenue is high at 224
percent.
Even in the absence of comprehensive reforms,
economic forces have had some impact on the
composition of revenue over the past 20 years.
The liberalization of trade through regional

integration and, more recently, the DR-CAFTA
agreement with the United States have resulted in
a significant loss in revenues from import tariffs.
In 1995, tariff revenue accounted for 24 percent
of total tax intake in Guatemala, but this fell to 8
percent in 2007 (when the DR-CAFTA agreement came into effect) and to 4 percent in 2014.
As a share of GDP, tariff revenue fell from 2.1
percent of GDP in 1995 to 0.4 percent in 2014
(figure 5.5). This development was accompanied
by a gradual strengthening of the administration
of domestic taxes as well as by incremental
reforms in tax policy, which especially strengthened the collection of VAT. As a result, the share
of VAT in total tax revenues increased from 36
percent in 1995 to 47 percent in 2014, replacing
some of the revenue that was previously generated by import tariffs. However, VAT revenues
remain heavily reliant on imports, which account
for 56 percent of all VAT collected. The general
VAT rate also remains low at 12 percent, below
the LAC average of 15 percent.
Given the limited size of the budget, the
composition of taxes and spending does not

reduce inequalities. A study of data from the
2009-2010 National Survey of Family Income and
Expenditure found that consumption taxes are so
onerous for the poor that they counteract the
benefits of cash transfer programs.7 In general,
indirect taxes tend to be less progressive than
direct taxes. This is because the most important
indirect tax, the VAT, is linked to consumption
and thus captures a wider tax base, including
poorer segments of the population. The most
important direct tax, the income tax, on the other

hand, has a much smaller base, consisting
primarily of salaried employees in the formal
sector. Similarly, the VAT is a flat rate tax applied
to most products, while income taxes tend to be
designed on a progressive scale (in other words,
richer taxpayers pay a larger share of their
income than poorer taxpayers). Social security
contributions are very low as well. On the
spending side, Guatemala has one of the lowest
social spending rates as a percentage of GDP in
Latin American and the Caribbean. As was

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

123

discussed in Chapter 3, while social spending in
Guatemala has increased as a share of total
spending, the quality of this expenditure remains
of concern, especially with respect to its geographic targeting and technical efficiency.
However, given the low levels of tax revenues,
even if the tax system were more progressive, it is
likely that its distributional impact would be very
limited. Even after the 2012 tax reform, only a
small share of salaried workers has had a positive
income tax bill, which means that the scope for
income redistribution through the tax system is
small. Any redistribution will thus have to come
from the expenditure side.
A combination of institutional and behavioral
factors lie behind the low tax revenues in
Guatemala. Tax non-compliance has traditionally
been high in Guatemala, as a result of many
Guatemalans’ perception of the unfairness of the
tax system and the lack of government capacity
to enforce the rules. Evasion of income tax is
estimated at between 60 and 65 percent of
collections, among the highest rates in Latin
America.8 Evasion and involuntary under-declaration together are estimated to account for
around 40 percent of VAT collections or 25
percent of potential VAT collections (figure 5.6).
These estimates suggest that improving controls
within the Tax and Customs Administration
(SAT) could lead to significant increases in
revenue collection. For example, for each 10
percent reduction in VAT non-compliance, VAT
collections would increase by 0.2 percent of GDP.
More recently, the SAT has experimented with
behavioral insights to increase tax collection
without the need for new legislation. It found that
improving the way in which the tax authority
communicates with taxpayers could help to
reduce tax evasion.9 Legal tax avoidance is also
widespread, with firms and individuals taking
advantage of a tax regime that applies different
rates to income derived from different sources.
124

In addition to non-compliance, tax rates and
tax expenditures (exemptions) are also key
factors, albeit less so than in the past. Previous
estimates by the SAT suggested that tax expenditures were as high as 8 percent of GDP in 2012,
but this included a number of items that are not
typically considered tax expenditures according
to internationally accepted criteria. However,
even according to the SAT’s revised methodology, tax expenditures reached 6.7 percent of GDP
in 2012, with income taxes accounting for the
bulk of this amount. The 2012 reform drastically
reduced tax expenditures for the personal income
tax from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 0.7
percent in 2013 (figure 5.7). This is because the
reform included a number of structural changes
to income taxes, including a reduction in
deductions, changes in the tax thresholds and tax
rates, and the elimination of the VAT credit. Of
the remaining tax expenditures (2.5 percent of
GDP in 2014), 0.5 percent of GDP are constitutionally mandated. While a further review of tax
expenditures (especially for the VAT) would be
useful, the SAT estimates suggest that any
additional revenue gains may be more limited
going forward.
The SAT’s weak institutional capacity is a
major obstacle to increasing tax revenues and
undermines citizens’ trust in the government.
Implementation and governance problems have
affected tax collection. The SAT suffers from a
dysfunctional governance structure, fragmentation and staff manipulation of information
systems, a lack of effective merchandise control
infrastructure in customs field offices, a lack of
information sharing with between internal units
(such as tax audit and tax collection), and weak
tax enforcement. Also, several corruption
scandals in tax collection have contributed to a
culture of tax evasion, which has further complicated the enforcement of the formal tax regime.

in which a criminal network diverted millions of
Quetzales to private citizens was exposed by the
Public Ministry (Ministerio Público, MP) and the
International Commission against Impunity in
Guatemala (CICIG). La Línea had inserted some
its members into the SAT as government officials
and technical personnel, and these people were
responsible for carrying out the illegal activities.
This resulted in a considerable fall in the public’s
trust in government institutions, and thus
diminished the amount of tax collected in 2015.
Efforts to boost revenues through tax reforms
have faced strong opposition, which has resulted
in a cycle of temporary fixes. Tax policy reforms
are frequently challenged in the constitutional
court and subsequently reversed. Opponents of
tax reform frequently challenge the reforms in
the Constitutional Court, referring to Article 243
of the Constitution that states that taxes should
not exceed taxpayers’ ability to pay.10 This
opposition has meant that successive incoming
Presidents have faced fiscal difficulties and the
need to introduce short-term fixes. This cyclical
introduction of temporary taxes has been
paralleled by sector-specific laws that have

increased exceptions and weakened progressivity.
In 2012, the government passed the first substantive tax policy reform in years, but overall tax
collections have not increased. In fact, after rising
from 8.2 percent of GDP in 1992 to 12.1 percent
in 2007, total tax collections fell to 10.8 percent
in 2014 and to an estimated 10.2 percent in 2015.
Moreover, even if the amount of tax collected had
increased, there would have been little extra
revenue to spend on priority public policies as
long as nothing was done to address the many
existing rigidities in the budget.
It is critical for the government to find a way to
raise revenues not only for Guatemala’s long-term
fiscal sustainability but also to increase social
spending and the provision of public goods.
Having “two Guatemalas” with different expectations and engagement with the state does not
make it easy to reach a consensus about the most
appropriate size of the public sector. In the debate
on tax reforms, some make the argument that the
main priority should be to increase the efficiency
of spending as a way to escape the vicious circle
of under-provision of public goods. As discussed
in Chapter 3, some studies have shown that

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

125

outcomes in the health sector, for example, might
improve if expenditures were to become more
efficient. However, regardless of any potential
increase in spending efficiency, with such low
levels of tax collection, it will be very difficult to
provide the level of health, education, and
security services that would be needed to
integrate the “two Guatemalas.” More importantly, the ratio of debt levels to tax revenue is
very high (239 percent) and is quickly approaching dangerous levels that could jeopardize
Guatemala’s relative fiscal stability.

Social Sustainability
To address the main risks to social sustainability, Guatemala must confront the challenges
of land tenure insecurity, lack of progress on the
indigenous agenda, and increasing dissatisfaction with the way democracy works. First, land
inequality is high and disputes over competing
property rights and boundaries have negative
consequences on economic and social sustainability. The existence of separate cadastral and
registry databases continues to fuel insecurity
over land tenure. Second, a lack of progress in
ensuring the rights of the indigenous peoples of
Guatemala is another source of social tensions.
Third, Guatemalans have the perception that little
progress is being made on many fronts, reflecting
the shortcomings of the social contract. Another
source of social vulnerability is the high levels of
crime and violence, a challenge that is discussed
in Chapter 4.

Land Tenure Security
Inequality of land ownership and insecurity of
tenure are hindering Guatemala’s prospects for
reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Inequality in the distribution of agricultural
land is a structural problem in the countryside

126

with historical origins in the allocation of land
grants during the colonial period and the privatization of communal lands during the liberal
reform period (1870-1930). Currently, small
producers make up 92 percent of farms, but they
only have access to 22 percent of the country’s agricultural land. In contrast, commercial
producers make up only 2 percent of farms but
control 57 percent of all agricultural land.11 Poor
households either have no land or cultivate less
than two hectares of land, often in marginal or
ecologically sensitive areas, which then results in
deforestation and soil degradation. Furthermore,
about 40 percent of rural land parcels are not
registered with the Land Registry, meaning that
their owners have no legally enforceable right to
their land. Until recently, there was no cadastre to
identify the location and boundaries of land parcels, which has consequences for land tenure security. Guatemala’s indigenous peoples are among
the most vulnerable to land tenure insecurity.
Although Guatemalan law recognizes customary
land tenure, these rights are often undermined by
a lack of formal documentation.
Guatemala has a complex legal and institutional history of agrarian reform. A radical
attempt at land reform in 1952 (Decree 31) was
aborted following the overthrow of the government of Jacobo Arbenz. Several laws were
subsequently passed that annulled the Arbenz
agrarian reform law, replacing it with other
mechanisms for land re-distribution such as a
land tax and an idle land provision (Decree 559).
The Agrarian Transformation Law (Decree 1551),
which was passed in October 1962, established
the National Institute of Agrarian Transformation
(INTA), an agency charged with distributing land
to the landless and land-poor, implementing a
titling program, and establishing a land purchase
program. INTA’s mandate was to expand the
program of distributing state-owned land and
continued to do so until the supply of these lands

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

was largely exhausted. The government created
the Land Fund (Fontierras) after the 1996 Peace
Accords, initially to allocate land to returning
war refugees. Returning refugees were settled on
land already owned by the state, much of which
consisted of farms that had been abandoned by
their owners and whose ownership had been
taken over by the state and administered by
INTA. When INTA was disbanded, the Land
Fund took over many of its activities, such as
adjudicating state-owned land and issuing
definitive land titles.
Market-based land reform had a limited
impact in land redistribution in Guatemala. After
the Peace Accords, the government introduced a
‘willing seller, willing buyer’ model with the aim
of redistributing land and improving the efficiency of land markets. Under this model,
Fontierras provided loans to groups for the
purchase or leasing of agricultural land, as well as
grant financing to help establish productive
projects, from which they would generate the
proceeds to repay the loan. Nonetheless, problems emerged due to overvalued land prices and
insolvent farms.
Meanwhile, peasant organizations have
mobilized to gain access to land. Since the Peace
Accords, several grassroots initiatives have
emerged in Guatemala to claim and secure access
to land. The amount of land secured through
these initiatives—based on historical land claims,
rural labor disputes, and land invasions— rivals
the quantity of land transferred through the
market-based mechanism.12 Historical land
claims are based on indigenous peoples’ historic
land rights and customary tenure. Other claims
are based on labor demands by former permanent workers (mozos colonos) of agricultural
estates. The invasion of agricultural estates is
another strategy to claim land, but these acts
often end with violent evictions.13

The implementation of policies for the
allocation, distribution, recognition, and enforcement of land rights requires strong political will
and long-term reform. The struggle for land was
at the core of Guatemala’s 36-year civil war. The
1996 Peace Accords established a new framework
for agrarian policy centered on redistributing
land, increasing security of tenure, and resolving
land conflicts. These were major tasks that would
require legal reforms and the collaboration of
multiple state and civil society actors. The
government has made efforts to implement land
reform, but these have not been sufficient to
change the overall agrarian structure. In fact, new
investments on agro-industrial crops are reinforcing existing land concentration dynamics.
Since 1998, the government has invested in the
establishment of a new land administration
system. One important achievement was the
approval of the Cadastre Law in 2005. The many
different legal origins of land rights in Guatemala,
including customary, colonial, and republican
claims, has resulted in a complicated system of
land tenure. Social conflicts often erupt from
these multiple claims on land, and the judicial
system is often ineffective in resolving them.
Communal lands are still an important source of
livelihoods and cultural identity for peasant and
indigenous communities. In recent years,
government policy has promoted the recognition
and protection of communal lands.

Establishing Rights for
Indigenous People
Progress has been made in establishing the rights
of the part of the population (almost half) that
self-identifies as indigenous but many gaps remain. The indigenous population in Guatemala
is large, around 42 percent of the total population
or 5.75 million people. It also suffers an unequal
burden of poverty and limited opportunities.

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

127

Starting with the Constitutional Reform of
1993, which contains several articles promoting
the cultural identity, equity, and protection of
indigenous peoples, many additional laws have
been passed to further promote and protect their
rights and to recognize Guatemala as a multiethnic and multi-linguistic state (see Annex 5.2 for
a detailed list of legislation affecting the recognition of indigenous rights). However, many of the
laws that are designed to recognize and promote
the rights of the indigenous peoples lack the necessary institutional mechanisms for implementing the laws, which means that legislation has not
resulted in better outcomes. Moreover, even in
the case of international legislation, such as the
Guatemalan ratification of ILO 169 (Indigenous
and Tribal Peoples), which allows for indigenous
authority over communities and land, indigenous
authorities have not been able to exercise these
rights in practice.
Another concern relates to the lack of a
mechanism for consulting indigenous people and
acquiring their informed consent to measures
that affect them. The absence of this consultation
has undermined both the content and the
implementation of laws. However, some progress
has been made in creating space within the state’s
institutions to promote the visibility, voice, and
vision of indigenous peoples, including the
creation of approximately 37 different sectoral
units, commissions, funds, and directorates. This
process has most recently culminated in the
creation in 2014 of an Indigenous Peoples
Presidential Cabinet, a high-level consultative
and deliberative organ that reports to the
President. The Cabinet’s objective is to coordinate
the formulation and management of actions and
policies that respect Guatemala’s ethnic and
linguistic diversity. Specifically, the Cabinet is
charged with promoting research on traditional
practices and with coordinating the design and
management of a National Policy and Action
128

Plan on Indigenous Peoples and Inter-culturality.
The multi-sectoral Cabinet has carried out
national-level consultations on a draft of the
Policy, which now has to be approved by the
relevant political authorities. The Action Plan has
not yet been prepared because of a lack of
resources to do so. However, the steps taken so
far have demonstrated the government’s commitment to increasing the visibility and political
priority of indigenous peoples in the national
development process and have resulted in the
creation of a platform that will be a critical
vehicle for addressing the multi-sectoral needs of
this population. (See box 5.1 for some evidence
from Mexico on the key components of obtaining
representation for indigenous peoples.)
Recent progress on the legal front is a promising development towards the creation of a more
cohesive social contract. After four decades, the
government agreed on a plan of reparations to
the 33 communities displaced by the Chixoy
dam.14 The plan contains a fairly wide range of
activities aimed at improving both the economic
and social well-being of the communities
affected. The first payments under the reparations
were made in October, 2015. Much rides on the
ability of the government to fulfill the plan as
agreed, as its failure to do so will undermine any
goodwill that the plan has generated. The second
recent event, the conviction of ex-military leaders
of rape and the enslavement of indigenous
women during the civil war, also demonstrates a
commitment to justice. It remains to be seen
what impact these events will have on the
construction of a more inclusive social contract
and whether Guatemalans will see these delays
responses as adequate.
The land rights of indigenous peoples often
come into conflict with mining operations.
Guatemala is a signatory of the UN Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which
requires the government to obtain the free, prior,

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

and informed consent of indigenous peoples
before adopting or implementing measures that
may affect them. Nonetheless, there is no
established mechanism for consulting with
indigenous peoples before such measures are
adopted. As a result, there have been numerous
complaints of inadequate consultations, environmental degradation, and human rights abuses. In

the absence of an official consultation process,
indigenous organizations have organized their
own public consultations based on municipal law.
In these consultations, indigenous peoples have
continuously rejected mining operations on their
lands.15

BOX 5.1 What Insights Can be Gained from the Chiapas and Oaxaca
Experiences?
Given many geographic and ethnic similarities between Guatemala and the two southernmost
states of Mexico, Chiapas and Oaxaca, there might be lessons that can be learned from Mexico
that can be applied to Guatemala. Both Chiapas and Oaxaca are states with a high percentage of
indigenous peoples (36 and 66 percent respectively) and high rates of poverty. In 2008 Chiapas had
the highest rate of poverty in Mexico (76.9 percent) with Oaxaca in fourth place at 68.3 percent. While
they were both still among the poorest states in 2014, multi-dimensional poverty had declined faster
in both states than the median rate in the country. Recent work in Chiapas highlights many of the
same barriers to poverty reduction as are found in Guatemala, namely that the limited complexity of
the economy leads to low incentives to accumulate more and more productive assets and that there is
a lack of coordination among different groups and between the indigenous peoples and the state (Levy
et al. 2015). At the same time, dependence on federal aid in Mexico can be attributed to a Dutch
disease effect, raising the costs of tradable goods and making the zone less competitive (Hausman et
al. 2015), a role that remittances seem to be playing in Guatemala.
Various analyses done in the context of Chiapas and Oaxaca (and other countries as well) highlight ways to promote inclusive growth in Guatemala. First, in Chiapas, there is a large gap between
the goals and the mechanisms of participatory spaces (local community authorities and organizational
structures) and invited spaces (where the government invites the participation of communities and
controls the process). Traditional spaces are as concerned with process as with end goals, have a
greater focus both on rights in general and on improving the collective and tend to have a long-term
planning horizon. In contrast, invited spaces usually reflect the much shorter time horizon of elected
governments, have limited capacity or experience with affecting collective outcomes, and, because of
their timeframe, and prioritize projects over longer-term changes. (See Cortez Ruiz, 2004 for Chiapas
and LaFrance and Nicols, 2010 for a more general overview in a different setting.) Finding a mechanism to close this gap is critical. At the same time, there is a need for the indigenous populations to
have institutions that are credible both to their constituency and to the broader society (Rosenthal,
2008) and to have access to government institutions (Anaya Muñoz, 2005). A striking difference
between Chiapas and Oaxaca is in access to formal government channels. Anaya Muñoz argues that

BOX 5.1 Continuation
representatives of the indigenous peoples were heavily engaged in the San Andres agreement in
Chiapas, much like the Peace Accords in Guatemala. Both agreements had positive effects, but in
terms of the politics of recognition of rights and culture, this was not enough. In Oaxaca the indigenous peoples also had access to formal power structures. At the municipal level, traditional electoral
practices resulted in indigenous peoples being elected to municipal governments and, at the state level,
a combination of factors gave them access to the governor’s office, albeit informally. Neither of these
channels was available to the indigenous peoples in Chiapas. This lack of access to formal channels has
translated into significantly less legislative change in Chiapas than in Oaxaca. Interestingly, in Oaxaca,
a state with almost twice the number of indigenous people as Chiapas but with more access to formal
channels, income poverty fell (from 41 to 34 percent) rate between 1990 and 2010 whereas in Chiapas
it rose (from 46 to 49 percent) (CONEVAL, 2015).

How Guatemalans Perceive their
Country?
Survey results suggest an underlying core of dissatisfaction among Guatemalans on issues related
to social cohesion and the social contract. Almost
70 percent of the population is dissatisfied with
the way that democracy works in Guatemala (figure 5.8). The government’s approval rating was
highest immediately after the Peace Accords were
signed but these expectations were clearly not
met in subsequent years as the approval rating
has since declined. The country ranks in the midrange of Latin American countries in terms of
the population’s satisfaction with its government.
A significant proportion of the population (24
percent) also feels that the country is in decline,
an increase since 2000 (figure 5.9). However,
more than half of the population believes that
the country is stagnating (54 percent). It is not
clear which changes in the indicators discussed
in Chapters 3 and 4 have had an effect on these
perceptions, though the increase in poverty
and other ongoing problems are likely to be key
factors.

130

Guatemalans are concerned about fairness and
opportunity and the factors that prevent them. As
seen in Chapter 4, when business executives are
asked to list the main problems of the country,
business executives answered crime and violence,
inflation and the economy, and jobs in that
order.16 When citizens were asked about what
freedoms were most at risk in Guatemala in the
2015 Latinobarómetro, they reported the just and
fair distribution of income led the list followed by
the difficulty of obtaining a job (figure 5.10).
Close behind in third place came the inability of
the state to protect citizens from crime and
violence, which is a problem that affects both job
creation and, therefore, a fairer distribution of
income. Moreover, the same 2015
Latinobarómetro reports that thirty percent of
respondents considered the existing income
distribution to be extremely unfair, and another
49 percent thought it was generally unfair
(Annex 5.1). In the 2000 Latinobarómetro survey,
when respondents were asked to rank themselves
on a scale of one to ten with one being the
poorest and ten being the wealthiest, the average
response was 4.7, but by 2015, the average had

fallen to 3.6. In the Latin America Region and the
Caribbean region as a whole, only in Honduras
was there a greater decline as this indicator
actually increased in most countries. On the one
hand, it is not surprising that the perceptions of
the population mirror what the empirical data

are showing - that incomes are falling and people
are becoming worse off. However, the perception
data also show that there is a high degree of
dissatisfaction, which may either serve as a
catalyst for change or may cause people to
disengage from the political process.

Environmental
Sustainability
Tackling vulnerability to natural hazards
and environmental challenges posed by deforestation, urbanization, and water contamination
will be critical for Guatemala’s development.
Many of these environmental challenges are
linked to difficulties in enforcing compliance
with existing environmental laws.17 First, Guatemala’s vulnerability to natural hazards exacerbates environmental problems. Second, deforestation is threating one of Guatemala’s main natural
resources that can potentially be sustainable
harvested and contribute to a variety of the quality of other natural resources, such as water and
soil quality. The Guatemalan System of Protected
Areas (SIGAP) covers about 31 percent of Guatemala, including the Maya Biosphere Reserve.18
Third, deforestation, agricultural practices, and
urbanization are putting pressure on the quality
of water resources. Fourth, Guatemala has one of
the fastest urbanization rate in the Latin America region, which will put pressure on natural
resources.

Vulnerability to Natural Hazards
Guatemala is among the 10 countries in the
world most affected by extreme climate events
and is not exempt from geophysical hazards.
The geographic location of the country makes
it prone to frequent and high-intensity geological and weather-related shocks such as storms,
hurricanes, droughts, earthquakes, and volcanic
eruptions.19 In 2010, Tropical Storm Agatha, the
strongest tropical cyclone to ever strike Guatemala in terms of rainfall, produced widespread
floods and landslides, causing estimated total
damages equivalent to 2.2 percent of GDP.20
Adverse weather events like Agatha combined
with vulnerable conditions can result in long-

132

term damage to the well-being of households. A
recent study found that between 2006 and 2011
per capita consumption plummeted by 5.5 percent (12.6 percent in urban areas) and poverty increased by 18 percent, equivalent to 80,000 more
families falling into poverty.21 The manifestations
of climate change disproportionately affect poor
households.22 Moreover, climate change also
has environmental effects, causing large-scale
soil loss, contamination of surface water, and
increased sedimentation in rivers and drainage
systems.23
In addition, cyclical droughts have a detrimental effect in rural areas by affecting crop yields
and food security. There are recurrent droughts
related to El Niño in the Dry Corridor (Corredor
Seco), which includes areas of the Quiche, Baja
Verapaz, Chiquimula, Zacapa, El Progreso,
Jutiapa, and Jalapa departments.24 Meager rainfall
results in crop losses for farmers but also in lower
demand for agricultural labor, as in the case of
seasonal workers for the coffee harvest. In some
years (for example, 2001 and 2009), farmers have
suffered from a combination of droughts and a
global recession. Moreover, the recurrence of
droughts, as in the past three years, makes it
more difficult for subsistence farmers to cope
with their crop and labor losses, and thus results
in seasonal hunger and increases in cases of acute
malnutrition (or even death due to malnutrition).
In 2014, the government declared a state of
emergency when 236,000 families in 208 municipalities were affected by a severe drought that
caused heavy falls in the production of maize (80
percent) and beans (63 percent).25

Deforestation
Another environmental challenge for Guatemala is deforestation due to changes in land use,
agricultural practices, and illegal logging. Forest
cover decreased from 44.3 percent in 1990 to 33.1

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

percent in 2012, with an annual deforestation
rate of 1.3 percent (figure 5.11). This annual loss
has accelerated since 2000. Much of the deforestation has occurred in the Department of El
Petén and, to lesser extent, Izabal. From 2006
to 2010, the latest period with data available, El
Petén’s forest cover, which accounts for about
half of the country’s forest mass, decreased by 1.7
percent per year (a loss of approximately 124,610
hectares).26 The main causes of deforestation in
Guatemala are: (i) the lack of rural employment
opportunities, which forces many households to
convert forested land into land used for agriculture or grazing; (ii) illegal logging in forests;
(iii) uncontrolled growth of existing urban areas
and new settlements; (iv) forest fires; and (v) the
extensive use of firewood for cooking and heating.27 The reluctance of rural residents to switch
to alternative fuels is both cultural and economic;
there has been a significant increase in the cost
of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) costs, and most
rural households prefer food cooked over wood
fires.28
Indigenous communities are managing forest
resources in the northern departments. Through

FIGURE 5.11

community forest concessions in the Maya
Biosphere and through communal forest land
management by indigenous and peasant groups
in the Departments of Alta Verapaz,
Huehuetenango, Izabal, and Quiche, indigenous
people manage the communal land and the
productive activities within the forest. However,
the forest concessions consist of a 25-year
contract with the Government of Guatemala,
which means that the ownership rights actually
belong to the state, thereby preventing the
transferability or sale of concession rights.
Deforestation is also having a significant
negative impact on Guatemala’s watersheds and
ecosystems. There is the potential to implement a
payment for environmental service (PES)
mechanism within Guatemala’s watersheds to
finance biodiversity conservation.29 This potential
varies widely across the country, but overall
around 25 percent of all biodiversity conservation priority areas have this potential.30 In fact,
the legal framework to enable PES has existed in
Guatemala since the mid-1990s (through the
Central American Convention on Biodiversity in
1992 and the Agreement on Biological Diversity

in 1995), yet no substantial efforts had been made
to implement this framework in practice.31
Community forestry has been an effective tool
for the sustainable use of natural resources in the
Petén department. In the early 1990s, community
groups and conservation NGOs lobbied the
government to allow community concessions to
manage the forest in the Multiple Use Zone
(MUZ) of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the
Department of Peten. These groups argued that
private logging concessions were doing a poor
job of managing the forest and that the National
Council of Protected Areas (CONAP) did not
have the operational capacity to monitor compliance with laws governing the preservation of the
environment. The government partnered with
local communities in the sustainable use of forest
resources and approved the first concession in
1994. By 2008, concessions grouped under the
Association of Community Forests of Peten
(ACOFOP) controlled an area of 426,000 ha.32
Concessions have had the right to use and
manage timber and non-timber products for 25
years. As a result, the MUZ has been significantly
less deforested than the buffer zone in South
Peten and the protected areas to the West (Sierra
del Lacandón and Laguna del Tigre).33 In the
highlands, uncertainty over the recognition of
communal lands is hindering the expansion of
the community forestry model.

Water Contamination
The uncontrolled discharge of untreated wastewater and solid waste and the increasing use
of agrochemicals have led to a considerable
contamination of water sources in Guatemala.34
Major watersheds, such as Lake Atitlán, that are
essential local sources of water for agriculture
and consumption, have suffered from eutrophication and other bacterial contamination with
negative implications for the health of the nearby

134

population.35 According to the 2012 strategic
plan of the Ministry of Enviromental and Natural
Resources (MARN), about 90 percent of Guatemala’s surface water in rivers, water springs, and
lakes, is contaminated to varying degrees. This
level of water contamination contributes to infant
mortality as a result of gastrointestinal illnesses,
especially when the majority of municipalities
have taken no action to chlorinate domestic
wastewater.36 Furthermore, out of nearly 24,000
controlled water systems and mechanical wells,
33 percent do have adequate levels of residual
chlorine, while 67 percent have been shown
to have some bacterial contamination, most of
which can be found in the areas of Escuintla, Alta
Verapaz, Petén, El Progreso, Jutiapa, and Chimaltenango.37

Urbanization
Rapid urbanization is creating environmental
challenges for the country. As of 2014, only 51
percent of Guatemalans lived in cities, which
was well below rates in other countries in
Central America and below the average for the
Latin America and the Caribbean region (79.6
percent). However, the pace of urbanization is
picking up, with an average annual growth rate of
3.3 percent during 1990-2014, and well above the
national average population growth rate of 2.3
percent. It is projected that continuing population growth and urbanization will add 13 million
people to Guatemala’s urban population by 2050
from its current level of 8.1 million.38 At the same
time, the proportion of the population living in
urban areas is expected to increase, reaching 67
per cent by 2050.39
Uncontrolled urbanization and significant
population density presents environmental
challenges such as the pollution of water and air
with negative consequences for human health.
The under-provision of water and sanitation

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

services in urban areas, especially the lack of
adequate sanitation, is a threat to water quality
and ultimately human health, and this is increasingly the case in Guatemala’s cities. Only 35
percent of domestic solid waste in urban areas of
Guatemala is disposed of in sanitary landfills,
while the rest is dumped into the streets and in
urban waste dumps. The increase in medical
waste is also becoming an acute issue. In 2010,
while 20 of Guatemala’s hospitals made use of
proper waste disposal services provided by
registered companies, eight still burned their
waste in the General Cemetery and 17 even
burned it within the hospital building.40
Urbanization also typically leads to an increase in
traffic, as has been observed in countries like
Costa Rica or Brazil, which in turn leads to a rise
in emission of pollutants with harmful effects on
human health.

Institutional Challenges
Guatemala faces significant challenges with
the quality of its institutions. According to the
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), Guatemala scores in the lowest quartile of the world
in three of six indicators (government effectiveness, rule of law, political stability) with the rule
of law indicator in the lowest decile (figure 5.12
Panel a). In all indicators, Guatemala is below the
world median; only in regulatory quality does
the country approach the median (scoring in the
48 percentile). In terms of control of corruption,
and voice and accountability, Guatemala is in
the bottom third of the ranking. Moreover, the
country has made no significant improvement in
any of the six dimensions of governance in the
past 20 years. The public institutions pillar of the
World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Competitive Index also show the weakness of Guatemala’s institutions (figure 5.12 Panel b). In nine of
the twelve components of the institutions pillar,

Guatemala ranks in the lowest 25th percentile of
the world and in five of those (business costs of
crime and violence, organized crime, public trust
in politicians, strength of investor protection, and
diversion of public funds) in the lowest decile.
More importantly, in the past 10 years, the percentile ranking of Guatemala’s institutions appear
to be deteriorating rather than improving for the
majority of the indicators of institutional quality.
Guatemala improved its percentile ranking in
only three areas, property rights, the burden
imposed by government regulations and transparency, nearing the median ranking. The trends
in the WGI and WEF indicators underscore a
worrisome picture of the quality of institutions in
Guatemala and the challenges ahead.
The origin of today’s weak institutions are
rooted in history. First, as discussed in chapter 1,
the expansion of the coffee sector in the late 19th
century contributed to a fragmented social
contract and society, reflected in the early
exclusionary land, labor, and education policies.41
Second, voice and accountability was negatively
affected by prolonged restrictions on who is
eligible to participate in selecting the government. The 1879 Constitution restricted the
population eligible to vote to literate males and
universal suffrage was enacted only in the 1965
Constitution. Third, the combination of historically low tax revenues and low constrains on
executive functions further undermined the
establishment of strong and effective public
institutions. Fourth, the civil war had consequences in terms of the level and composition of
spending, affecting the provision of public goods.
In short, Guatemala’s early economic model
combined with the limited ability to influence
policies through the political system by the vast
majority of the population have worked against
the formation of strong institutions and has
undermined the ability of the country to develop.

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

135

Political institutions, such as political parties,
are also weak, further constraining voice and
accountability. Political parties are vehicles for
social groups to influence public policies and
existing institutions.42 Parties contribute to
shaping and building a strong social contract
through the roles that they perform in mediating
constituency relations with the state.43 However,
Guatemala stands out for having the most volatile
and fragmented party system in Central
America.44 Political parties are short-lived, with
many appearing and disappearing from election

FIGURE 5.12

to election. A large share of congressional
representatives change their party affiliation after
elections or take positions in the executive.45 In
the last elected congress, about half of the
representatives changed their party affiliation.
The practice of changing party affiliations is
detrimental for voice and accountability. In April
2016, the congress reformed the law to restrict
the practice of changing parties. Another feature
that has reduced the effectiveness of political
parties to influence public policies is the limited
participation of indigenous groups in Congress.46

BOX 5.2 The Commission Against Impunity and Accountability
In 2007, Congress approved the establishment of the Commission against Impunity in Guatemala
(CICIG). Working under the umbrella of the United Nations, the CICIG was designed to aid local
investigators and police in developing prosecutable cases aimed at eradicating criminal networks.
With impunity levels then at an alarming 98 percent, the judiciary was seen as too weak to do so on its
own. Since its creation, the CICIG has assisted in securing convictions in a number of high-profile
cases involving top government officials, most recently, as discussed above, the customs fraud scheme
known as La Línea. The Commission’s findings led to the arrest of Guatemala’s President and Vice
President as well as other government officials. Thus, the CICIG has managed to change the public’s
perception that criminal networks are impregnable.
Guatemalans are increasingly demanding a more transparent and accountable government. In the
past, Guatemalans have been tended to be either disinterested in public issues or reluctant to express
dissent. This culture of fear and silence was a result of the bloody civil war between 1960 and 1996, in
which over 200,000 people were killed. Even as late as 2015, 52 percent of the population believe that
freedom of speech is still not generally protected. However, this tide of silence appears to be shifting as
young people who did not live through the conflict begin to feel empowered to take a stand. The
revelations of the La Linea scandal triggered public outrage and sparked a large number of public
protests in the streets, organized mainly through social media. These protests have shaken the state’s
political stability and resulted in the resignation of the Vice President and several ministers. It will be
interesting to see if the results of new opinion polls reflect any change of attitudes.

In short, Guatemala’s political parties suffer from
various limitations to coordinate policy making
and that maintain the status quo.
The weaknesses are reflected in a slowdown in
the legislative activity by Congress. Legislative
production shows some cyclicality with the
presidential terms. During the past two presidential terms, the number of Decrees approved per
year by Congress has been higher in the first year
of a presidential term, declining afterwards.
Moreover, the share of Decrees approved in the
same year that they introduced is also higher in
the first year of a presidential terms. The number
of Decrees approved during the 2008-11 was 2.3
times higher than during the presidential term of
2012-15.

Emerging Priorities
As this chapter has demonstrated, there are
several fiscal, social, and environmental priorities that the Government of Guatemala needs to
focus on. First, fiscal revenues remain a problem.
While better targeting and more efficient use of
existing resources can help to fill the revenue gap,
the overall shortage in revenues will continue
to impede growth, inclusion, and sustainability
of growth. This will need to be accompanied
by changes in earmarks of revenues. Second,
resolving the issues related to land ownership
and land management will allow large segments
of the rural population to realize returns on their
individual and collective assets while, at the same
time, protecting the biodiversity of the country

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

137

and mitigating climate risk. Land issues remain
a critical point of social conflict: settling these
issues could have a significant positive effect,
especially for indigenous peoples. Finally, proper
water management linked to land management
is needed to ensure the viability of the country’s

hydropower as well as the irrigation of agricultural land. Also, reversing and preventing further
pollution of water resources will be critical to
protect the health of people and of the natural
environment and to aid in the eradication of
malnutrition.

One of the largest invasions in recent years took place in
the Polochic Valley during 2010, when approximately 800
Q’eqchi’ families occupied sugar cane plantations. These
families were former workers who had been negotiating the purchase of land from land owners through
Fontierras since 2002. However, the negotiations with
the communities were dropped when sugar mills from
the Pacific region bought the land to expand cultivation
in the Polochic River Valley. In retaliation, the Q’eqchi’
families invaded the estates in November 2010. They
occupied the land for five months before being violently
evicted.

In the case of land, the government enacted discriminatory property rights laws and supported massive land
expropriation from indigenous peoples along with the
privatization of their communal land. In the case of labor,
the government legalized different forms of mandatory
forced labor that affected indigenous groups. Elements of
non-inclusive labor laws persisted until the mid-1980s.
In the case of education, the economic model of large
plantations and subsistence wage economy reduced
the incentives for both workers and the government to
invest in education. The education system that developed
excluded the indigenous people, with most of them
(mainly women) remaining illiterate.

Sustainability of the Pattern of Growth, Distribution, and Poverty Reduction

6. Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An
Agenda of Priorities
Guatemala is a country with significant
potential for growth and for improved welfare.
The country’s strategic location vis-à-vis international trade, its substantial natural resources,
and its young multi-ethnic population with the
associated chance for a demographic dividend
all contribute to this potential. Guatemala has
lived up to its promise in many ways. There is
a dynamic private sector that has benefitted
from macroeconomic stability and sound trade
policies. Exports have increased as a result of
substantial growth and increased productivity in the agricultural sector. The emergence of
Guatemalan companies that are able to compete
internationally (Guate-Latinas) illustrates the
strengths of the Guatemalan economy. Hand-inhand with successes in economic growth, there
have been impressive gains in some social indicators over the past 15 years. In particular, Guatemala has been able to substantially lower its child
mortality rate to the extent that it has met the
MDG goal and it has also expanded educational
opportunities, particularly at the primary level.
Access to basic public services such as electricity,
water, and sanitation has also increased over the
past 15 years.
However, Guatemala is one of the poorest
countries in the Latin America and the
Caribbean region. Poverty is both deep and
persistent. A majority of the country’s population
live in poverty, a share that increased from 55
percent in 2000 to 60 percent in 2014, using the
international poverty line of US$4 per day. There
is little intra-generational socioeconomic
mobility, with 37 percent of Guatemalan households being chronically poor, which is about 50
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

percent more than the average for the Latin
America and the Caribbean region. Malnutrition
(stunting) rates among Guatemalan children are
high, similar to those found in countries with
substantially lower levels of GDP. Guatemala has
ranked 106 out of 110 countries with data on
stunting since 2010, which is almost the exact
same ranking that it had in 2000.1 Shared
prosperity, as measured by the average growth of
incomes for those in the bottom 40 percent of the
population, was non-existent in Guatemala
between 2000 and 2014. Inequality of income, as
measured by the Gini coefficient, was 0.49 in
2014, well below previous levels but still placing
Guatemala almost at the top of global inequality
rankings. The middle class is small (consisting of
less than 10 percent of the population), which is a
reflection of the barriers that people face in
trying to move out of poverty.
Aggregate indicators of economic development
suggest that Guatemala’s growth path has diverged
from the paths of richer countries. Guatemala’s
current per capita GDP is now 6.7 percent of that
of the US, whereas in 1960 it was 8.4 percent.
Meanwhile, Latin America and Caribbean
countries in general were able to improve their
position relative to the United States from 12.2
percent of US per capita GDP to 18.1 percent. In
Central America, Guatemala’s lack of convergence
with the United States has been similar to that of
Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua,
Guatemala’s neighboring countries with which it
shares similar development challenges. In
contrast, Panama and Costa Rica, like most Latin
American countries, have made headway in
converging with the United States. Today,
141

Guatemala is the fifth poorest economy in the
Latin America region in terms of per capita GDP,
a drop of five positions from its rank in 1960.
The previous chapters have described the large
gaps in outcomes and opportunities that characterize the country and have resulted in two
Guatemalas. One Guatemala is rural and the
other urban, one is indigenous and the other
non-indigenous, one informal and the other
formal, and one lacks access to basic services
while the other has the ability to pay for those
services when the state does not provide them.
Indigenous people in Guatemala are 1.7 times as
likely to be poor as non-indigenous people and
are also poorer than indigenous people in most
other Latin American countries. Chronic
malnutrition (stunting), is high throughout the
country (affecting 47 percent of all children), but
the figure is 66 percent among children in the
lowest welfare quintile and 61 percent among
indigenous children.2 This is much higher than
malnutrition rates among indigenous children in
El Salvador (40 percent), Peru-Quechua (15.4
percent), India (25.3 percent), and Brazil (25.7
percent).3 The differences in stunting rates among
wealth quintiles within Guatemala are large,
ranging from 17 percent in the top quintile to 66
percent in the lowest. In education, the gaps are
also large: rural inhabitants have, on average,
only 3.7 years of schooling compared with 6.2
year for urban residents. In 2006, the gap in
sixth-grade reading test scores between the poor
and the middle class in Guatemala was the largest
in the Latin America region.
The differences between the two Guatemalas
are also clear in economic terms. Nationally,
economic activities are carried out by a small
formal sector with social protection (18 percent
of workers) on the one hand and a large informal
sector (82 percent of workers) on the other. The
share of workers who are not covered by social
security in Guatemala is among the highest in
142

Latin America and the Caribbean. In two of the
largest sectors, agriculture and commerce, 94
percent and 86 percent of employment is
informal, respectively. After controlling for
workers’ endowments, earnings in the informal
sector are almost 60 percent lower than those in
the formal sector. The large informal sector is a
symptom of a lack of opportunities and low
productivity in the economy as a whole.
Agriculture, a sector of particular significance to
the economy, has a dualistic structure with
export-oriented large farms on the one hand and
subsistence-oriented small farms on the other. At
one extreme, Guatemala has become a leading
exporter of agricultural products such as sugar
and cardamom and has the most efficient
sugar-loading terminal in the world.4 At the other
extreme, small farmers grow food for the
domestic market and for their own consumption,
and their productivity is declining or stagnant.
There is an urgent need to close the gaps
between the two Guatemalas. The success of both
Guatemalas depends on recognizing the interdependence between low per capita growth and
high inequality and how this affects growth and
development outcomes. Empirical evidence
shows that too much inequality is detrimental to
growth. Under certain conditions, inequality can
create beneficial pressures on an economy: for
example, inequality of outcomes can provide
incentives to individuals to accumulate human
capital and to firms to invest and innovate.
However, the evidence suggests that in a country
like Guatemala with limited upward socioeconomic mobility and a state structure incapable of
equalizing opportunities to build human capital
and create access to basic infrastructure services,
inequality comes at a considerable cost.
The persistence of low growth and high
poverty suggest that Guatemala is trapped in a
low development equilibrium. Guatemala’s
development has been hindered by two
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

equilibrium because neither of the two
Guatemalas has the resources or opportunities to
change it. The more dynamic formal sector of
Guatemala is too small to be able to provide the
funding for the basic public goods needed to
support the economy, such as transportation
infrastructure, pollution controls, public health
protections, basic sanitation in urban slums, and
the provision of technical assistance to small
farmers or entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, those in
the informal and excluded sectors of Guatemala
cannot contribute to the economy because of the
limited opportunities available to them to
increase their human capital, find good jobs, and
rise out of poverty. The net result has been the
two Guatemalas that are evident today.
The underlying dynamics between the two
Guatemalas are represented in figure 1.2. The
fragmented social contract leads to a general

fundamental and interlinked features: (i) a
fragmented social contract (the implicit agreement between the state and its citizens about
their respective about roles and responsibilities),
and (ii) weak institutions. The economic and
social dynamics of colonial times and the
development of an economy based on large coffee
plantations resulted in a fragmented social
contract and a preference for a small state sector
on the part of the populations of the two
Guatemalas. This dynamic, in turn, created weak
public institutions that have not been able to
provide universal access to quality public
services, creating unequal opportunities for both
individuals and firms. Change has been minimal
given how little accountability there has been
within the system and how large segments of the
population have had little say in public affairs.
The country is trapped within this low-level

acceptance of a small and weak state. On the one
hand, those who do not benefit from public
spending have little incentive to pay taxes or
demand greater tax collection. On the other
hand, those who do benefit from public spending
are unwilling to pay taxes or to expand the state
apparatus to provide services to all. The low taxes
ensure that the small, weak public sector does not
have the capacity to improve the management of
public investment, which, in turn, constrains the
provision of public services,lowering its quality.
Economic growth is restricted because of the
limited capacity of the state to invest in the
infrastructure needed by the private sector and to
enforce the rule of law. Private households must
either do without services or pay out of pocket
for the services that should be provided by the
government such as security, education, and
health care. The history of weak constraints on
the executive has resulted in ineffective controls
on spending and the inefficiencies and corruption that arise in such conditions. The inability of
the state to provide services to large groups of the
population has led the voting population to feel
excluded and disaffected. The net result has been
considerable inequality of outcomes between
different segments of the population, starting in
childhood and continuing into adulthood, and
the perpetuation of low growth, high poverty,
and the two Guatemalas.

What are the
Implications for Action
and the Costs of
Inaction?
The combination of a low-level equilibrium rooted in weak institutions and large gaps
in welfare outcomes between different groups of

144

Guatemalans suggests that a major coordinated
effort - a big push - will be needed to set Guatemala on a more inclusive development path. Realistically, marginal or incremental interventions
will not be enough to overcome the self-reinforcing dynamic that currently exists in Guatemala.
The underlying effects of the fragmented social
contract and weak institutions permeate all sectors of the economy and all population groups.
Underfunded and ineffective public institutions
provide too few services to create the conditions
for upward mobility. Low and inefficient levels
of social spending limit the population’s access
to the basic services that they need to accumulate human capital. Multiple deficiencies arise as
malnutrition combined with limited access to
health and education services further undermine
human capital accumulation. This reduces employment opportunities and thus prevents many
households from generating the income needed
to purchase scarce basic services. At the same
time, the small size of the middle class and the
population’s limited voice and participation in
political life act as a damper on effective demand
for change. This combined with the long-standing structural problem of low levels of investment
lead to continued low growth in per capita GDP.
Public investment is constrained by inefficiencies and a lack of public resources, while private
investment is constrained by crime and a lack of
public investment in infrastructure. Low investment reduces productivity, which slows the pace
of economic diversification, reduces the sophistication of exports, keeps Guatemalan firms from
being competitive, and constrains growth in job
creation, earnings, and savings. Without addressing these multiple problems in parallel, there is
little possibility of Guatemala’s economy rising
out of its present low-level equilibrium.
The extent of the policy inertia in the system
should not be under-estimated. Even the Peace
Accords of 1996, which were a comprehensive
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

attempt at change, have not been fully successful.
The inertia has even started to unravel the
changes that occurred after the Peace Accords,
with primary education enrollment rates falling
again and access to health care declining. While
institutions are resistant to change, there has also
been little or no pressure for change from an
unengaged population. Poor households have no
voice with which to express their need for better
public goods and services, and better-off households can afford to opt out of the system,
purchasing goods and services from the private
sector. Neither group sees itself as benefitting
from the state. There is a need to bring both
groups into the system. In short, what is fundamentally needed is a new consensus on the role
and size of government - a new social contract.
This cannot be done by small-scale, marginal
interventions because the magnitude of the
deprivation and the barriers to development are
too large. In Guatemala’s environment of limited
resources, strong historical trends, and policy
inertia, it will not be easy to initiate a big push for
change. Nor is it clear what would propel it, but it
is possible that the present political environment
is conducive for just such a push.
While there is potential for a big push to
succeed at this time, the costs of failing to change
now are also greater than in the past. The current
rapid urbanization of the country will make it
cheaper and more efficient to provide basic
services to the population as service provision in
densely populated areas is more cost-effective
than in sparsely populated rural communities. At
the same time, the rapidly urbanizing population
means that pressure on the government to
actually deliver quality services can be expected
to increase. The demonstrations of the past year
that were sparked by the La Línea scandal have
shown how easy it can be for the urban population (especially the growing youth population) to
organize and generate demand for change. If the
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

government continues to fail to provide enough
basic services of good quality in urban areas, this
may create social instability that would hamper
investment and increase security tensions.

Policy Areas
This section discusses the policy areas where key
changes are needed to set Guatemala’s economy
and society on a path to a new model of development.
Three fundamental criteria were used in this
report to identify the key policy areas where
changes are needed. The first is that the issue in
question must be significant in terms of its
magnitude or scale. The reasoning behind this is
that closing the gaps between the two Guatemalas
will require interventions that will affect broad
swathes of the population and that will have
widespread effects. Given how many significant
problems need to be addressed in Guatemala,
however, this criterion was not quite enough to
determine which policy interventions should be
prioritized. It was necessary to add a further
condition - that the priority areas be ones in
which Guatemala is an outlier, where the scope of
the problems sets the country apart from its
peers. As discussed in the previous chapters,
these areas are malnutrition, education, fiscal
policy, and land concentration.
The second criterion was that the actions to be
recommended within these key policy areas
should work together to create synergies and
should multiply the effect of the other actions.
This is a critical criterion given the small size of
the economy and the public sector. The lack of
financial resources stemming from low government revenues, the lack of human capital in the
public sector, and the weaknesses of the institutions themselves make effective policy change
difficult. Therefore, it is imperative that each
action taken should make sense in its own right,

145

tackle fundamental bottlenecks, and yield
multiple outcomes, while at the same time
complementing the investments and activities in
other policy areas.
Finally, the third criterion relates to the timing
of the policy actions. The policy interventions to
be chosen need to create some degree of positive
change as soon as possible. Given the depth of
poverty in Guatemala, where the extremely poor
are truly extremely poor, at least some interventions need to enhance welfare immediately. The
next generation of children needs proper
nutrition and education if Guatemala is to be able
to take advantage of the demographic dividend.
At the same time, the events of the past year have
led to a drop in already low revenues. Stopping
this downward spiral and finding ways to
increase revenue collection is fundamental. And
nothing can be done unless actions are taken that
will rapidly spur citizen engagement and
strengthen the social contract. Other actions can
be chosen that will have more medium-term
goals such as efforts to improve the overall
investment climate in order to foster the creation
of the kind of jobs that will enable people to rise
out of poverty. Given the high share of the
population who are dependent on the agricultural sector today, it will also be necessary to
increase the productivity of investments in the
sector, while moving towards a shift out of
agriculture in the medium term. However, even
for those policies with longer-term goals, actions
need to be taken now to begin to the process of
change. The big push will require that activities
are carried out in parallel as taking them sequentially will not move the country forward at the
necessary speed.
This SCD has identified a critical set of policy
areas where actions must be taken to ensure
inclusion, promote growth, and reduce poverty in
Guatemala. Malnutrition is the cause of many
inequities and deprivations as well as being a
146

barrier to the development of both individuals
and the economy. The lack of education limits
opportunities for individuals and undermines the
productivity and potential of the economy. To
promote economic growth, there is a need to
increase investment, and, by improving the
investment climate, the returns to investment. In
particular, given the current dependence of
households in both Guatemalas on agriculture,
investments aimed at increasing productivity in
that sector will be key to improving welfare
outcomes and increasing growth. Changes in
fiscal policy are needed to promote equity and
generate sufficient resources to provide needed
public goods. Actions are also needed to address
the unequal distribution of land, which constrains social and economic progress, and to
make Guatemala less vulnerable to the frequent
occurrence of natural disasters, which set back
development efforts and economic growth.
Above all, there is the need to forge a new
pluralism in Guatemala in which all people feel
committed to and included in the social contract.
In all of these policy areas, given the unequal
burden of poverty and deprivation borne by the
indigenous peoples, interventions must be
designed to be pro-indigenous as well as being
pro-poor.

Tackling Malnutrition
The extent of malnutrition in Guatemala, along
with its historical intractability and its effects on
other welfare outcomes, puts solving the malnutrition conundrum at the top of any priority
list. With 47 percent of the under-5 population
being chronically malnourished, Guatemala’s
level of chronic malnutrition is closer to those in
poor Sub-Saharan countries than the levels in its
Latin American neighbors. This means that in
2015 around 740,000 Guatemalan children were
malnourished and, at this rate, every year another

Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

125,000 will be added to the list.5 In 2012, the
government announced a Zero Hunger Pact in
which it called for a decrease in malnutrition of
10 percent over three years. The actual decline, 6
percent over eight years, has been starkly inadequate to solve the country’s rampant nutrition
problem, in even the medium term.
Malnutrition represents a substantial cost to
Guatemala. It limits people’s opportunities to
participate in the economy and to contribute to
the country’s social and economic development.
The direct costs of malnutrition to individuals are
high, leading to a greater risk of mortality, higher
morbidity, and lower cognitive development, and
can perpetuate poverty across generations. Also,
research in other countries has found that
chronic malnutrition in children leads to a 22
percent loss of earnings in adulthood.6 Reducing
chronic malnutrition can have a wide range of
effects from lowering infant mortality and
morbidity to improving child development,
learning, and school outcomes to better labor
market outcomes and increased productivity.7 A
longitudinal study conducted in Guatemala
between 1966 and 1977 demonstrated the
positive impact that better nutrition can have on
growth, school attainment, and labor capacity
and in terms of higher rates of literacy, numeracy,
and information processing.8 The cost of malnutrition to the economy is also high as it undermines investments in public services and
deprives the labor market of productive workers.
Solving the malnutrition challenge will require
multi-sectoral interventions in the areas of
health, education, water and sanitation, and
agriculture. Evaluating the experiences of the
government flagship nutrition program, Zero
Hunger, could provide important insights as will
updating the analysis of the UNICEF framework
with data from the 2014/15 ENSMI.9

Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

Providing Quality Education for
All
Improving education is another key investment
with great potential to increase equality of opportunities in Guatemala and to promote economic
development. Guatemala has a long way to go to
bring its education system up to the standard of
its peers. In 1970, the average number of years
of schooling in Guatemala was below any of its
peer countries. Forty years later that statement is
still true. The gap has shrunk between Guatemala
and the next closest country, which reflects the
government’s recent efforts to improve schooling, particularly among indigenous women, but
relative to the average of all of its peer countries,
Guatemala is not doing well. The transition rate
of students between school levels continues to be
below that of other countries, repetition rates are
exceptionally high, and the low scores of Guatemalan students on international tests continue to
highlight the difficulties that the government is
facing in trying to provide quality education for
all. The recent decline in primary school enrollments raises additional concerns.
Three characteristics of Guatemala make
education a priority. First, the country continues
to have a high fertility rate. This means that
demand for schooling will remain high for the
near future. It also means that there is a potential
economic dividend that can be reaped in the best
case scenario. In the worst case scenario, the
demographic dividend can become a trap if the
new generations are not educated. Second, the
country is characterized by low productivity. An
uneducated workforce hinders growth by
limiting not only economic productivity but also
the pool of taxpayers. Third, education has many
other benefits beyond its immediate economic
impact. As shown in Chapter 3, the higher the
educational attainment in the household, the
better the nutritional outcomes for children. A

147

lack of education reduces the opportunities
available to individuals and can be a threat to
social cohesion, especially in the context of
wide-spread crime and violence. Education can
increase social cohesion by helping to foster a
shared national identity, which is particularly
relevant in Guatemala given its multiple ethnicities, cultures, and languages.

Unlocking Private and Public
Investment Levels
Achieving higher growth will be an elusive goal
in Guatemala without increasing investment levels. Guatemala has one of the lowest private and
public investment levels relative to GDP in the
Latin America region. Access to finance remains
a challenge for SMEs as the financial sector does
not yet provide the kind of instruments that
could be used by SMEs, such as factoring and
leasing. Investments in infrastructure that will
increase the connectivity of Guatemalan firms
with both internal and external markets will be
critical to fostering the integration of the two
Guatemalas. Other constraints, such as crime and
violence, limited connectivity to markets, weak
enforcement of laws governing contracts and
property rights, and geographical inequalities
in the delivery of public services also negatively affect returns to investments, and thus, the
propensity of firms to invest in the first place. On
the public sector side, capital expenditures have
reached a historic low in recent years (2.9 percent
of GDP in 2014) and are not sufficient to finance
much-needed public infrastructure investment.
Public-private partnerships could potentially be
an alternative to finance infrastructure projects
given Guatemala’s low levels of tax collection.

148

Boosting Agricultural
Productivity
The agricultural sector has created the largest
number of jobs in the past 15 years, and boosting its productivity will be critical for improving
the earnings of the poor. A sustainable growth
strategy in agriculture must focus on enhancing
the productivity of smallholders and fostering
opportunities for high-value-added production.
Large gains should have been realized from the
introduction of inclusive export crops such as
coffee and cardamom (which mostly involve
small-scale producers). However, growth in these
subsectors has been constrained by the disastrous effects of large-scale outbreaks of pests and
diseases, the failure to adopt technology such as
irrigation, and the absence of any strong market
coordination. The government will need to support the formation and consolidation of organizations of small farmers, mainly those of indigenous peoples, to help them to take advantage of
economies of scale and diversify their production. Also, increasing agricultural productivity
is, of course, integrally linked to resolving the
land issues discussed below. Given the extreme
inequality of land distribution in Guatemala
(with 8 percent of producers accounting for 92
percent of the productive land), it will be crucial
to develop a well-functioning land market and to
increase the security of land tenure.

Reforming Fiscal Policy
Low domestic resource mobilization has been a
recurrent constraint to Guatemala’s development
by limiting the extent to which public spending
can be used as a policy tool. Guatemala’s tax
revenues are far below the regional average as
a percentage of GDP and have not increased
since the late 1990s, despite several efforts by the
government to improve tax administration and
to reform the tax system. There is large degree of
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

informality in the economy, which means that
the potential exists to broaden the tax base but
this will require not only a larger private formal sector but also a more educated workforce.
Furthermore, the government is hampered in its
management of public expenditures. There are
extensive rigidities embedded in the Constitution that pre-commit almost 90 percent of fiscal
revenues.10 Moreover, the effectiveness of public
spending is impeded by weaknesses in budget
processes ranging from the practice of preparing
budgets based on past allocations (rather than on
sectoral plans and results), to excessive reallocations during the budget year, to the frequent use
of extra-budgetary vehicles and the accumulation
of payment arrears. The use of non-competitive
procurement practices and frequent cost overruns, especially in public works contracts, also
reduce the positive impact of public spending.
While better targeting and more efficient use of
existing resources can help to fill the revenue gap
to some extent, these gains will never be enough
to resolve these institutional weaknesses and
the chronic shortage of available services. Only
significantly and consistently higher revenues will
address these otherwise intractable problems.

Promoting Territorial Planning
Land has played a difficult role in Guatemala’s
history. The coffee boom in the late 19th century
resulted in a series of discriminatory property
laws and the expropriation of land belonging to
indigenous peoples along with the privatization
of their communal lands. The civil war in the
20th century had its seeds in the conflict between
the demand for, and the resistance to, land reform. Despite significant attempts by the government to address land tenure issues, communal
land ownership was only recently legally recognized, and land conflicts continue to be common.
The very high concentration of land ownership in

Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

Guatemala (a Gini coefficient of 84 percent, well
above those for either income or consumption)
is a source of economic and social stress in a
country where 50 percent of the population lives
in rural areas. Meanwhile, the absence of any
systematic territorial planning is undermining
efforts to protect the environment.
Introducing nationwide territorial planning
and resolving the conflicts related to tenure will
be beneficial for economic growth, social welfare,
and the environment. Land is the major productive asset of many Guatemalan households. If
they do not have secure tenure over that land,
then they have no incentive to invest in it.
Without the legal rights to their land, farmers
cannot use it as collateral, thus reducing their
access to financial markets. When land is not
used for agriculture, investors face increased
costs and conflicts with communities who see
few options for redress in cases of unclear
ownership. For indigenous peoples, land plays an
important role in their cosmovision: thus, a lack
of tenure and control over their ancestral lands
continues to foment social unrest. Finally, the
current environmental degradation in
Guatemala, including water contamination and
deforestation, is the result of inadequate land use
and management.11

Addressing Natural Disasters
and the Environment
Guatemala’s geographic location makes it vulnerable to a full range of extreme weather events
and natural disasters. Thus, it is critical to build
its resilience to natural disasters, especially for
the poor. The government has taken steps to put
in place an agenda for disaster prevention and
mitigation, such as mainstreaming disaster risk
management into national development plans
and territorial planning addressing disaster risk.12
Two key steps are needed in this area. First, the

149

government needs to encourage the financial
sector to provide instruments to help individuals
and firms to cope with risks, such as insurance
and savings mechanisms. This will reduce the extent to which social and infrastructure spending
has to be diverted to disaster response activities.
Second, growing urbanization and the lack of
land management exacerbates the negative effect
that natural disasters have on water access and
quality. Water is a crucial resource that affects
public health, agricultural livelihoods (through
irrigation), and the viability of the country’s hydropower. Also, malnutrition cannot be eradicated without clean and plentiful water. Therefore,
it is vital to improve the management of water
resources and to reverse and prevent further
pollution of water resources to protect the health
of both people and the natural environment.

Generating Social Accountability
and Forging a New Social
Contract
There is a need to increase pluralism in constructive ways. Guatemalans are increasingly
demanding a more transparent and accountable
government. Until recently, they have often been
characterized as disinterested in public issues or
as reluctant to express dissent due to the Civil
War, in which more than 200,000 people were
killed. As recently as 2015, 52 percent of the
population indicated their belief that freedom
of speech was not well protected in Guatemala.13 However, there appears to have been a shift
as young people who did not live through the
conflict appear to feel empowered to take a stand.
The public protests of the past year in reaction
to the La Línea scandal were organized mainly
through social media and were instrumental in
the resignations of the Vice President and several
ministers. So there may be an opening for the
creation of a new social consensus about the
150

roles and responsibilities of the government in
relation to the population. Transparency will be
essential for the sustainability of this new social
contract, which will require mechanisms for the
public to monitor government policies, spending, and actions. A range of social accountability
mechanisms will need to be implemented to
increase information flows, construct spaces for
citizen-state interactions and create a process of
negotiation for change.14

Change and Recent
History
Effecting real change in Guatemala will not
be easy. History, vested interests, and tradition
have created a degree of inertia that will be hard
to break. The Peace Accords and the recent La
Línea scandal have highlighted both the possibilities and the difficulties of making substantive and
sustainable change. In many ways, the 1996 Peace
Accords, which ended a 36-year long armed
conflict, represented a turning point towards the
development of a more inclusive social contract
in Guatemala. The Accords laid out a path for
closing the gap between the rich and the poor
in the country, in part through a set of fiscal
and social targets, including greater and more
targeted social spending (education and health)
and greater domestic revenue mobilization. The
Accords also established a new framework for
agrarian policy centered on market-assisted land
distribution aimed at increasing the security of
tenure and resolving land conflicts. Moreover, the
Accords officially recognized that the country is
made up of four distinct ethnic groups—Maya,
Xinka, Garifuna, and Ladino—and also subscribed Guatemala to the ILO’s Convention 169
relating to indigenous peoples. Despite the consensus reached through the Accords, however, in
1999 a national referendum held on the question

Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

of whether to incorporate certain rights specific
to indigenous communities into the constitution
was defeated. Recent analyses have also pointed
to several continuing flaws in national legislation
on social justice: (i) laws recognize that rights
exist but there are no institutional mechanisms to
ensure that the rights can be exercised; (ii) ILO
169 is not being applied or enforced; and (iii) a
continued lack of widespread consultation with
stakeholders has undermined the content of the
laws in question. Land tenure issues continue
to be a source of conflict, and recent closures
of public health facilities in remote rural areas
suggest that sustaining change is also difficult.
In sum, the Peace Accords changed much but
were not enough to move the country onto a path
towards lower inequality, higher revenue mobilization, and higher growth.
The recent La Línea scandal may have opened
a window of opportunity for change. The 2015
scandal had the positive effect of galvanizing a
segment of the population to demand accountability in government and the enforcement of the
rule of law. Together, the protesters (who held a
weekly vigil in the Plaza in Guatemala City), the
independent investigation unit (CICIG), and the
Justice Ministry have demonstrated that impunity is not inevitable in Guatemala. Citizen
engagement, at least by the urban middle class,
was shown to be effective. The protests and the
Justice Ministry’s actions not only resulted in the
most senior government officials being held
accountable but also galvanized the population to
engage in the political process, with record high
numbers of voters participating in the recent
presidential elections. Whether this state of
affairs will continue is unknown. And the extent
to which the newly engaged and empowered
electorate will generate long-lasting changes in
development policies has yet to be seen. In the
end, the continuation of this positive trend will
depend on creating a new social contract in
Closing the Gaps in Guatemala: An Agenda of Priorities

which the political system responds to the
demands of the population, thus spawning a
virtuous cycle of citizen engagement and effective
government, and moving the two Guatemalas
into alignment.
Closing the gaps between the two Guatemalas
will enable the country to harness its full potential. Breaking the self-reinforcing dynamics of a
fragmented social contract, weak state institutions, low growth, and high inequality will
require a complex and ambitious agenda of
actions. The prerequisite will be the creation of a
high-level political consensus about the need to
forge a new social contract. The priorities
identified in this Systematic Country Diagnostic
focus on closing the gaps in such a way that will
allow Guatemala and all of its citizens to flourish.

An Agenda for
Knowledge
In the process of carrying out the analysis for this report, important knowledge gaps
were identified. Filling these gaps will require
the collection of new data and new analyses. It is
hoped that further work can be done to increase
our knowledge about Guatemala and about the
factors that will affect its growth, equity, and
sustainability:
•

Lack of an up-to-date census. Carrying out
any analysis, either at the macro level (for example, on per capita GDP) or at the household or individual level (on poverty rates
or even ethnicity), requires accurate figures
on the number of people in the country
and their characteristics. Population and
Housing Censuses are carried out every 10
years in most countries, but Guatemala’s last
Census is 14 years old. The new government
is beginning to plan for a new Census. Once

151

•

those data are available, it may be advisable
to update and revise the analysis in this
report, particularly the analysis based on
the 2014 data, if the population shares from
the Census are significantly different from
those being used in the present population
projections.
Malnutrition. What new information is
needed to shed light on malnutrition levels
and their intractability? One question is
whether there has been any change in the
synergies among the dimensions in the
UNICEF framework (health, care, environment, and food) over time. Analyzing the
data from the 2014/15 ENSMI when they
are available should provide answers to this
question. A second question relates to the
role played by mycotoxins in malnutrition.
Collecting new data on food sources and the
presence of aflatoxins (by re-visiting households visited in previous surveys) could be
a cost-effective and powerful way to answer
this question.

factors driving the recent decline in primary

criteria resulted in the following set of countries:
Bolivia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Senegal.
Under aspirational peers, we want to aggregate
countries that may be used as good examples of
development for Guatemala and that Guatemala
may emulate. Thus, we set the following criteria for the period 2001 - 2013: (i) lower middle
income and upper middle income countries; (ii)
GDP per capita growth higher than 3 percent;
(iii) inflation below 5 percent; (iv) maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 live births) less than 100;
and (v) population below 35 million. Countries
that are “natural intensive”, landlocked, or islands
were excluded. This classification delivers the
following group of countries:

The structural peers were selected using the
“Find your friends” tool. The group of structural
peers includes countries that provide appropriate
benchmarks for answering SCD-relevant questions such as whether or not certain conditions,
policies, or economic performances in Guatemala
are adequate. The criteria and filters for selection
were the following: (i) lower-middle-income
countries; (ii) population between 5 million and
25 million people; (iii) Agriculture, value added
(% of GDP) less than 20 percent; and (iv) small
island states were excluded. The use of these

sobre Pueblos

1989

Annex 5:2: Legislation Supporting Indigenous Rights

Resumen sobre el instrumento
La Convención reafirma que la discriminación entre
seres humanos por motivos de raza, color u origen
étnico constituye un obstáculo a las relaciones
amistosas y pacíficas entre las naciones y puede
perturbar la paz y la seguridad entre los pueblos, así
como la convivencia de las personas aun dentro de
un mismo Estado. Por lo que: “Los Estados partes
tomarán, cuando las circunstancias lo aconsejen,
medidas especiales y concretas, en las esferas
social, económica, cultural y en otras esferas, para
asegurar el adecuado desenvolvimiento y protección
de ciertos grupos raciales o de personas
pertenecientes a estos grupos, con el fin de
garantizar en condiciones de igualdad el pleno
disfrute por dichas personas de los derechos
humanos y de las libertades fundamentales.”
Esta Convención transforma la visión del C107 de
integracionista y proteccionista a una Convención
que incluye la participación activa de los pueblos
indígenas en la construcción de su propio desarrollo,
cada vez que los Estados apliquen las disposiciones
de las legislaciones nacionales tengan en
consideración el contenido del Convenio 169. Uno de
sus artículos importantes destaca: Artículo 2:
1. Los gobiernos deberán asumir la responsabilidad
de desarrollar, con la participación de los pueblos
interesados, una acción coordinada y sistemática
con miras a proteger los derechos de esos pueblos y
a garantizar el respeto de su integridad.
2. Esta acción deberá incluir medidas:
a) que aseguren a los miembros de dichos pueblos
gozar, en pie de igualdad, de los derechos y
oportunidades que la legislación nacional otorga a
los demás miembros de la población;
b) que promuevan la plena efectividad de los
derechos sociales, económicos y culturales de esos
pueblos, respetando su identidad social y cultural,
sus costumbres y tradiciones, y sus instituciones;
c) que ayuden a los miembros de los pueblos
interesados a eliminar las diferencias
socioeconómicas que puedan existir entre los
miembros indígenas y los demás miembros de la
comunidad nacional, de una manera compatible con
sus aspiraciones y formas de vida.
Otros aspectos que también incluye el C169 es la
consulta con los pueblos indígenas a través de sus
instituciones y otras formas de organización propia,
cada vez que se adopten medidas que afecten sus
intereses, asuntos y convivencia. El consentimiento
previo de los pueblos indígenas también se
constituye aspecto fundamental de carácter
transversal en el contenido de las normas y por
consiguiente de los derechos que allí se tutelan.

Resumen sobre el instrumento
Lo más importante que desarrolla este Convenio es
reconocer la importancia que representa para la
conservación de la biodiversidad y los ecosistemas del
planeta, los conocimientos tradicionales, la práctica
de las comunidades locales e indígenas en mantener
la conservación desde sus formas tradicionales y la
función decisiva que desempeña la mujer en la
conservación. Un extracto de la Convención es la
siguiente: “Reconociendo la estrecha y tradicional
dependencia de muchas comunidades locales y
poblaciones indígenas que tienen sistemas de vida
tradicionales basados en los recursos biológicos, y la
conveniencia de compartir equitativamente los

Naciones Unidas, el 13 de septiembre de 2007. El
mismo instrumento es uno de los más importantes
en la protección y salvaguardia del los derechos de
los pueblos indígenas, también se constituye en el
primer instrumento que en su formulación durante
más de 2 décadas, contó con la participación de
representantes de los pueblos indígenas en el Grupo
de Trabajo constituido en el seno de las Naciones
Unidas para su elaboración. En este instrumento se
reconocen derechos colectivos fundamentales para
la existencia de los pueblos como el derecho a la libre

en todo lo que implica este término en el derecho
internacional, con su plena autonomía y el ejercicio

los demás elementos que incluye el término
territorio, como garantía a la existencia de las
futuras generaciones.
