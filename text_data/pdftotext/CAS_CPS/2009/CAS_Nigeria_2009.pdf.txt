NIGERIA: SUSTAINING THE MOMENTUM FOR REFORM
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Since 2003, Nigeria has been carrying out an ambitious agenda of reforms. The most
far-reaching of these was to base the budget on a conservative reference price for oil, with
excesses saved in a special account. Other significant reforms were launched in public finance,
banking, oil and gas, power, telecommunications, ports, steel, and mining. The economy
responded with strong growth between 2003 and 2007, but slowed in 2008, in the wake of the
global economic crisis. The Nigerian economy remains dominated by oil, which accounts for 95
percent of export earnings and 85 percent of government revenues; with oil prices dropping to
roughly one-third of their 2008 peak, the near term prospects for economic growth and fiscal
balances have weakened.
2.
Nigeria faces significant short-term challenges. The global economic crisis is affecting
the economy through decreased international financial flows—direct foreign investment, private
foreign lines of credit, and remittances—as well as a lower price of oil, which has a large impact
on Nigeria’s trade and fiscal balances.
3.
Medium term development challenges are equally large, however. Poverty is significant
in Nigeria, and reducing it will require strong non-oil growth and a focus on human
development. Constraints have been identified to enhancing growth, including the investment
climate; infrastructure, incentives and policies affecting agricultural productivity; and quality and
relevance of tertiary education. In spite of successful initiatives in human development, Nigeria
is off-track for meeting most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), with a particular
focus required on Northern Nigeria.
4.
Underpinning these challenges is the core issue of governance. While Nigeria has
undertaken important governance reforms—in public financial management, in reducing public
corruption—improving governance remains the main challenge at all levels of government, and
in particular at the state level. Fiscal decentralization provides Nigeria’s 36 states and 774 local
governments considerable policy autonomy, control of 50 percent of government revenues, and
responsibility for delivery of public services. Capacity is weak in most states, and improving
governance will be a long term process.
5.
The donor partnership is expanding under the second phase. Based on good experience
under the previous country partnership between the Bank and Department for International
Development (DFID), this strategy will include the Bank Group, DFID, United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), and the African Development Bank (AfDB). The
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) partners account for over 80 percent of Nigeria’s
development assistance.
6.
The CPS covers FY10-13 and focuses on three themes to transform and diversify
Nigeria’s economy: (i) improving governance; (ii) maintaining non-oil growth; and (iii)
promoting human development, identified by the Government and reaffirmed in the stakeholder
consultations. To achieve better governance, the new CPS will focus on how Bank group and

v

partners can help the government strengthen its own systems over the long term—going beyond
fiduciary controls over our own funds given that we are a small player in Nigeria. Governance
will be both a core theme and a cross-cutting theme, an integral part of virtually every form of
support. Each partner will focus on these three areas, with varying degrees of emphasis. The
partnership will also provide support to the government to deal with the impact of the global
crisis.
7.
Overall governance is central to this CPS. Governance support will be addressed in five
areas: (i) transparency and accountability; (ii) participation; (iii) sector governance; (iv) capacity
development; and (v) judicial reform and democratic governance. All partners will engage in
strengthening government systems to improve outcomes in human development and growth, but
in the interest of selectivity, only DFID and USAID will focus on judicial reform and democratic
processes.
8.
Maintaining non-oil growth will involve focus on sector governance and targeting
interventions in: (i) infrastructure to support growth clusters; (ii) promoting private sector
involvement by investment climate improvement through efforts to streamline bureaucracy in
areas such as land registration, planning approvals and building permits (DFID support to land
registry and Joint World Bank-DFID Investment Climate Assessments); (iii) technical and
vocational education to address the skills gap in employment-intensive value chains (subsectors); and (iv) reducing import bans and high tariff barriers. The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) will seek opportunities in agribusiness and infrastructure (power), and
diversification within the financial sector. The elements prominent in IFC strategy are: (i)
advisory services to improve the business environment; (ii) diversification within financial
markets to new product lines such as trade finance, housing finance, insurance, small and
medium enterprise finance and increased power generation and distribution, developing local
fixed income capital markets and credit bureaus.
9.
Support for human development will aim to improve access and utilization of services.
Support to education will have a particular focus on girls’ education in the North, while in health
the priority will be on support to maternal and child health. Partners will also support vertical
disease programs on a more modest scale than in the past and with greater emphasis on health
systems. The partnership will also focus on increasing the access and utilization of services by
the extreme poor and vulnerable.
10.
To support Government’s response to the global financial crisis, the Bank is preparing
a Development Policy Operation (DPO) of $500 million for approval in early FY10. The
proposed credit is intended to provide budgetary support to the Federal Government of Nigeria
(FGN) to offset the fiscal impact of the crisis and support the government in maintaining its
current economic reform path in the financial sector, fiscal policy and management, and
governance. IFC is undertaking initiatives, including an examination of the capital requirements
of selected banks, and potential equity investments by the Bank Capitalization Fund, one of the
IFC crisis response initiatives.
11.
Partnership assistance at the Federal level will be across all three pillars. In
governance, for example, support will continue for on-going initiatives to strengthen
procurement, public financial management, civil service reform, and statistical capacity building.

vi

Under non-oil economic growth, the partnership will engage in policy dialogue and projects such
as DFID’s and Bank’s joint Growth and Employment in States (GEMS) project and USAID
projects including MARKETS II and Trade Capacity Development. Under human development,
the partnership will focus on the social safety net agenda, both to respond to global crises and to
improve targeted programs such as the Conditional Cash Transfer program (CCT) and the Youth
Empowerment and Employment Program.
12.
The lead state approach to concentrate resources in a few performing states in the
previous CPS raised issues, in particular of geopolitical balance among Nigeria’s six zones.
For this CPS, partners will no longer seek to agree on a single set of lead states among all
partners. Rather, state selections will be based on states’ needs, agreement with Government,
state level governance capability and commitment, geopolitical balance (across all six zones),
and existing state programs.
13.
Lending instruments will be tailored to the conditions of each state. In states with poor
human development indicators, for example, but with weak public sector, the partnership will
continue to use project-based lending and grants. In states with a stronger track record on
governance/fiduciary systems, the partnership will develop state-wide sector programs for
financial and technical support. In the Niger Delta, the partners have been seeking opportunities
to work with state governments demonstrating commitment to reform and better governance.
The Bank and USAID are currently implementing Community Driven Development (CDD)
projects in the core states of Niger Delta and the Bank has recently had a good discussion with
Bayelsa state. The partnership will consider supporting a process of harmonizing national CDD
approaches.
14.
Drawing on experience of other countries, governance could be addressed by use of
State Development Policy Operations (SDPOs). In states that have a relatively good track record
on public sector reforms, a reasonably strong fiduciary system and low debt levels, the Bank will
consider the use of SDPOs, possibly twinned with Technical Assistance (TA) operations; other
partners will consider moving to programmatic support. Providing reformist states with DPO
support could also provide incentives for other states to follow their example, even if the DPO
amounts are relatively modest compared to the states’ other resources.
15.
Partnership support. The indicative amount from the International Development
Association (IDA) over the FY10-13 period is $4.5 billion. DFID is proposing to increase its
support in FY10-11 to £120-£140 million per year, AfDB has a loan of UA80 million in its
lending program, and USAID has not yet defined the financial envelope. Partners will focus on
all three pillars but selectively under each pillar. In many areas, partners will work jointly (DFID,
USAID and the Bank in investment climate, enterprise development, health systems, HIV/AIDS,
girls’ education in Northern Nigeria; and with AfDB in energy and transportation). Further
integration of trust fund activities will be expanded over the CPS period.
16.
The partnership strategy for Nigeria contains a number of risks. The magnitude and
duration of the impact of the global financial crisis on the Nigerian economy is uncertain.
Second, the risk of policy reversals or reform slowdown must be taken into account. The
deterioration in the law and order situation in the Niger Delta could shift the government’s focus
from economic matters, as could the upcoming presidential and legislative elections in 2011.

vii

These risks can be mitigated by ensuring broad support for programs both at Federal and state
levels and strengthening government institutions so that success becomes less dependent on
individuals, but the presence of strong champions within the government will also be important
to maintain a steady pace of progress in reforms, as well as sustained efforts to end militancy in
the Delta.

NIGERIA: SUSTAINING THE MOMENTUM FOR REFORM
I.
A.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

Political Economy

1.
The last decade has been the first period of continuous democracy in Nigeria. Since
independence, Nigeria has experienced a series of military regimes, a devastating civil war and
several democratically elected governments unable to complete their terms in office, until 1999,
when President Obasanjo was elected, and then re-elected in 2003. With the election of President
Yar Adua in 2007, one democratically elected government handed power over to another for the
first time in Nigeria’s history. Recent violence over local elections point to continued tension,
however, in many areas of the country.
2.
Nigeria emerged in 1999 from a long period of mismanagement and important reforms
were enacted from 2003. Before 1999, successive governments at Federal, state, and local levels
systematically mismanaged the economy. Starting in 1973, export revenue and government
resources were dominated by oil revenues, which increased more than nine-fold over a seven
year period. Successive regimes spent the large budget receipts when oil prices were high and
did not reign in spending when oil prices were low, resulting in boom-bust cycles, macro
instability, and massive accumulation of debt. Although large investments were made in the
1980s and 1990s in infrastructure and services, corruption was rampant, infrastructure was not
maintained and services deteriorated. Poverty increased, and social indicators declined or
remained stagnant. Nigeria’s outlook was bleak. After the peaceful transition to democracy in
1999, and especially after 2003 with the adoption of widespread reforms, this outlook changed.
3.
From macro-management to sector reforms, the agenda was ambitious. The most
fundamental reforms were in fiscal management. In 2003, a team of technocrats introduced farreaching changes in Nigeria’s planning, budgeting and financial management system, and took
firm steps to deal with corruption. Most importantly, Nigeria’s budget was de-linked from
fluctuations in oil revenues by introducing in 2004 a budget system based on a conservative
reference price for oil, with excesses saved in a special account (the Excess Crude Account
(ECA)). The largest debt relief in the history of the Paris Club was secured for Nigeria in 2005,
providing fiscal space to increase social expenditures. Other ambitious initiatives were launched
to increase transparency and to reduce corruption in the management of public finance and civil
service reform was begun, although progress in this area has been mixed. The Economic and
Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) successfully convicted high-level politicians of
corruption and recovered embezzled funds.1 Significant sector reforms were also undertaken,2
1

Between 2005 and 2008, for example, convictions increased from 20 to 200 cases and recovered assets from less
than $1 billion to more than $5 billion, but this momentum has not been sustained.
2
Nigeria was among the first countries to adopt and implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to
improve governance of the oil and gas sector; an audit of the sector from 1999 to 2004 was carried out, although
recommended reforms have not yet been implemented. In the financial sector, banking supervision was strengthened and the
banking system was consolidated. The telecommunications sector was deregulated and the power sector was unbundled into
18 companies for generation, transmission, and distribution. Privatization and concessioning were initiated in the ports, steel,
mining, and petrochemicals sectors. The pension system was replaced with a fully-funded contribution system.

but important gaps remain between legislation and implementation and progress has not been
steady. Significant challenges remain at both the federal and especially the state levels.
4.
Economic performance in 2003 to 2007 was strong. The success in de-linking the budget
from the fluctuations in oil revenues was central to the turnaround in Nigeria’s economic
performance. Public expenditures were contained, budget deficits were turned into surpluses, and
inflation rates of 40 percent per year in the 1990s were reduced to 14 to 18 percent in 2001-2005 and
to single digits in 2007.
5.
The non-oil economy grew rapidly. Benefiting from the reforms, the non-oil economy grew
by 9 percent per year in 2003-07, in contrast to 3.5 percent per year between 1997 and 2000 (see
Table 1). Growth was driven largely by the agriculture and services, which dominate the economy,
with particularly strong growth in general commerce and telecommunications.3 While manufacturing
has also grown rapidly, its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is modest, at some 4
percent. This growth likely occurred independently of the high oil prices during the period, because
the adoption of an oil—price based fiscal rule since 2003 de-linked expenditure from oil prices.

B.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments

6.
Following robust growth in 2007, Nigeria’s economic growth decelerated in 2008, in
the wake of the global economic crisis. The GDP grew by an estimated 5.3 percent in real terms
in 2008—compared with 6.4 percent in 2007. Oil output declined by 5.5 percent—owing to
growing unrest in the Niger Delta. However, non-oil growth remained buoyant at 7.7 percent,
reflecting growth in all sectors of the economy.
7.
The overall fiscal balance of the consolidated government in 2008 was a robust 4.9
percent of GDP. Total consolidated government expenditure in 2008 fell marginally from 29.5
percent of GDP in 2007 to 27.8 percent in 2008. While federal government expenditure is
estimated to have fallen from 15.9 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 13.5 percent in 2008, states and
local government expenditure is projected to have risen from 12.4 percent to 13.8 percent.
8.
The federal government was effective at resisting pressure from the states to share
savings from ECA. In the first half of 2008, a total of $6.8 billion was shared from the ECA with
states. Also in June 2008, $5.3 billion from the ECA were allocated to the power sector, but the
necessary approvals have not yet been given by all state legislatures.
3

Shares of agriculture and services in GDP are 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

2

9.
In 2008, inflation increased well above the single digit range, reaching 15.1 per cent
(year-on-year) in December. This hike was due not only to the increase in food prices during the
year, but also a rise in core inflation, reflecting the rapid expansion of liquidity. Monetary growth
continued to accelerate in 2008, largely due to an increase in credit to the private sector,
concentrated in a few sub-sectors: oil and gas, telecommunications, and wholesale and retail
trade, although individuals and households increasingly benefited from consumer and mortgage
credits. Credit growth slowed significantly at end-2008 as a result of the global economic crisis,
which affected both foreign trade credit lines to Nigerian banks and Nigeria’s stock market, to
which Nigerian banks are exposed.
C.

Impact of the International Financial Crisis

10.
Nigeria’s economy is affected by the global financial crisis through falling commodity
prices, reduced net capital inflows (in particular foreign direct investment (FDI) and
remittances), and the drying up of trade finance and international lines of credit. Oil continues
to play a dominant role in the Nigerian economy. The fall in oil prices from a peak of $147/bbl in
July 2008 to around $40/bbl presents tremendous macroeconomic challenges for Nigeria.
Although oil revenue has been managed carefully over the past years with government building
up savings in the ECA, falling oil prices, production problems, and the deteriorating fiscal
outlook have reduced international confidence and triggered a reduction in Nigeria’s sovereign
credit rating outlook. Also, large portfolio outflows beginning in early 2008 had triggered a
decline in the stock market which further accelerated in the wake of the crisis. The smaller oil
revenue inflows, weakening confidence, and lower net capital inflows have put increasing
pressure on the Naira, further deterring investments. In combination, these factors led to liquidity
pressures within the banking system in late 2008 and the first months of 2009. Confidence in the
banking system has eroded due to concerns about the true level of capitalization of the banks and
the impact of the slowdown in growth of the stock market on asset quality. Recent years' growth
in the banks' lending portfolios also presents a challenge to the banks in managing their credit
risks and to the authorities in ensuring adequate reporting and disclosure by the banks. The CPS
addresses these concerns both through the policy actions relating to bank accounting, reporting
and supervision which are central to the proposed DPO as well as ongoing and intended further
policy dialogue and technical assistance support to the authorities.
11.
Non-oil growth projections have been revised substantially downwards to 4 and 3
percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively, from 7.7 percent in 2008, thus ending the sustained,
broad-based expansion that Nigeria enjoyed since 2001. Compounded by the continuous decline
in oil output, overall growth in 2009 and 2010 is expected to fall to 2.9 and 2.7 percent
respectively, down from 5.3 percent in 2008. In addition to falling commodity prices, the growth
outlook reflects the impact of the anticipated second-round effects of the global economic crisis
on Nigeria, as declining remittances and FDI inflows lead to a weakening of aggregate demand.
12.
Nigeria’s current account balance is projected to move from a surplus of 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 9.0 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2010,
reflecting significantly lower oil export earnings. External reserves are projected to continue to
decline from a peak of $62 billion in September 2008 to $39.6 billion (about 8.8 months of
import cover) by end-2009 and $37 billion (about 7.5 months of import cover) by end-2010.

3

13.
The fall of oil prices and declining capital inflows have led to a substantial reduction in
foreign currency inflows and triggered a depreciation of the exchange rate. In an effort to stem
the depreciation of the exchange rate, the Central Bank of Nigeria imposed temporary exchange
restrictions in January 2009 and suspended the operation of the interbank foreign currency
market. These measures have had the effect of stabilizing the exchange rate in the Central Bank
official window. However, they have also resulted in increased activity in the parallel market for
foreign exchange: between end-November 2008 and end-March 2009, the spread between the
parallel market and the official rate was about 38 percent, but recently it has declined to around
24 percent. The Central Bank also imposed caps on lending rates, a measure that could distort the
credit markets and erode confidence in the government’s policy responses to the crisis. The
Central Bank has recently announced that it will eliminate restrictions within 3 months, including
through the liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the licensing of bureau de change, and
other measures.
14.
The overall fiscal balance is projected to turn from a surplus of 5 percent in 2008 to a
deficit of 8.4 percent in 2009 and 3.4 percent in 2010 (see Tables 2 and 3). The projected
widening of the fiscal deficit is based on a conservative oil price of $45/bbl. The primary balance
as a percentage of non-oil GDP is expected to improve from 27.8 percent in 2008 to 25.1 and
22.0 percent in 2009 and 2010 respectively, reflecting the fact that much of the increase in the
overall deficit is due to higher capital expenditure. In response to the crisis, the 2009 budget caps
recurrent expenditure, and makes a determined effort at targeting major growth bottlenecks
through higher allocations for capital spending in priority sectors. In percent of non-oil GDP,
recurrent expenditure will decline by 1.3 percentage points in 2009 reflecting cuts in overhead
expenditure (reduced international travel and transport, workshops, and meal entitlements).
Capital expenditure will increase by 2.4 percentage points of non-oil GDP in 2009, mostly in the
area of works, housing, agriculture, transport and power.

Financing the 2009 budget will meet significant challenges. Financing needs for the
federal government are estimated at Nigerian Naira 1.2 trillion or $8 billion (at the official
exchange rate). The government has already decided to draw $1.5 billion from the ECA. The
government is committed to exercising considerable caution in the use of the ECA to avoid its
rapid depletion, since withdrawals must be shared with other tiers of government and could lead
to sharp increase in overall government outlays that may result in a decline in foreign reserves,
putting further pressures on the exchange rate.

Macroeconomic Outlook: CPS Period (2010-2013)

16.
Nigeria’s economy is expected to follow the world economy in a gradual recovery
starting in 2010, helped by fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and financial sector measures.
Real GDP growth is projected to improve from 2.7 percent in 2010 to over 6 percent in 2013
with non oil growth at 6.3 percent in 2013 (see Table 3). Following the expected strengthening of
oil prices over the period, overall fiscal balance would improve from a deficit of 3.4 percent in
2010 to 0.7 percent in 2013, while the external balance will improve from a deficit of 3.5 percent
in 2010 to 1.6 percent in 2013. Gross international reserves are projected to increase from $37
billion (7.5 months of imports) to $49 billion (8.3 months of imports).
E.

Progress Towards MDGs

17.
Nigeria is currently off-track in achieving most of the MDGs.4 Table 4 shows Nigeria’s
current status on the MDGs and likelihood of attaining the 2015 goals. National statistics also
mask strong regional variations; progress towards the MDGs is slowest across Northern Nigeria.
18.
Nigeria aims to achieve universal primary education and gender equality at the primary
level by 2015, but significant challenges remain. Primary school enrollment increased rapidly
from 19.2 million in 2001 to 23.0 million in 2005. However, in both the North East and North
West regions net and gross enrollment rates are very low with less than one in every two children
of the appropriate age in primary school. In addition, quality and learning outcomes are poor.
4

More recent progress on MDGs will be available with results from the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health
Survey in 2009, the Education Data Survey in 2010 and a new Nigeria Living Standards Survey, also in 2010.

The Education for All Monitoring Report suggests that states’ primary net enrollment rate is 63 percent. If this is correct, the
MDG will not be attainable.

19.
In health, some initiatives have met with success but the MDGs will be hard to attain by
the target date of 2015 or even by 2020. In recent years, for example, the government has taken
considerable measures to improve routine immunization, eradicate polio, lower the incidence of
malaria, and combat HIV/AIDS. In 2007, the lowest polio incidence since 2002 and the lowest
incidence ever of Type 1 polio were recorded, but in 2008 polio incidence increased dramatically and
remained high despite progress in 2009 against socio-religious objections and improved campaigns
involving better supervision of vaccinators.5 Because of significant challenges in the national effort
to interrupt wild polio virus transmission, Nigeria contributes the highest number of polio cases in the
world. The second phase of the malaria booster program launched in December 2008 and the recent
distribution program supported by all development partners should help Nigeria to expand malaria
prevention, care and treatment programs, and to sharply reduce the incidence of malaria related
deaths. The focus is now on use of bed nets which studies show is still low. Finally, there has been a
decline in the rate of HIV/AIDS in women between the ages of 15 and 49 from 5.8 percent in 2001 to
3.2 percent in 2007. About 92 percent of sex workers report condom use with recent clients.
20.
Attaining the MDG on gender equality is also a challenge, especially in the Northern
states. Nigeria has a poor performance record on gender equality measures. On the Gender
Development Index it ranks 123rd out of 140 countries. Discrimination against women has
contributed to persistent gender disparities in key social indicators. In education, a small
5

As of December 2008, 797 polio cases had been recorded in 26 states, which was almost three times the number of
cases for the same period one year earlier. Kano State leads the country with 272 cases (60 cases in 2007), followed
by Zamfara State, both in the North West Zone, with 85 cases (five cases in 2007).

6

improvement in the primary and secondary school gender ratio in recent years from 80 percent in
2002 to 85 percent in 2005 masks wide regional inequalities. Maternal mortality rates are high
across the country (828/100,000 live births), and catastrophic in the North East and North West
zones. In Kano state, for example, the rate is three times higher than the country average
(2,400/100,000 live births). These rates are closely linked with women’s adult literacy (20
percent) and the median age of first marriage (14.6 years) in the North West zone.
F.

Poverty and Inequality

21.
Nigeria's prospects to halve income poverty by 2015 relative to 2000 will not be clear,
because of absence of good data, until the next Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS)
is completed in 2009. Strong growth in the non-oil economy, however, especially since 2003,
suggests that poverty may have fallen substantially over the last five years (from over 54
percent), particularly because growth has been widespread across all sectors. A recent analysis of
data of General Household Surveys since 1999 and of the 2003 LSMS indicates that real
incomes in the formal and informal sectors rose significantly, especially in the rural informal
sector. Nevertheless, halving income poverty by 2015 would require an acceleration of non-oil
growth to about 12-13 percent, a rate which at the present time seems unrealistic.
22.
Rates of poverty vary significantly between urban and rural and Northern and
Southern areas of the country. According to the 2003-2004 National LSMS, 54 percent of the
population lives below the poverty line. In urban areas, the poverty incidence is 43.1 percent
compared to 63.8 percent in rural areas. Over 75 percent of agricultural households in the north
live below the poverty line, while the South-South Region with 59.3 percent poverty has the
highest rate for the South. Among the states, Jigawa has the highest percentage of the population
below the poverty line (91 percent) and Oyo state has the lowest (21 percent).
23.
Rates of poverty correlate strongly with educational attainment. Families with heads of
households with some university level education have an average expected consumption 38
percent (in rural areas) to 45 percent (in urban areas) higher than families with heads of
households without any education. Completing secondary schooling in rural areas brings a 13
percent gain versus no schooling and in urban areas, the gain is 15 percent. Completing primary
school brings no significant advantage in urban areas, and a gain of 12 percent in rural areas.
24.
Nigeria’s level of inequality is higher than in Ethiopia and India, but lower than in
Brazil and Madagascar. The average masks a large disparity among States, however (Gini
coefficient of .33 in Sokoto, .64 in Lagos). There is no major difference between rural and urban
areas in terms of inequality. In terms of regional profile, a belt of states across the middle of the
country have the highest levels of inequality, while states in the Niger Delta have moderate
levels. States with high poverty levels are not necessarily the states with high levels of
inequality: Jigawa and Kebbi, for example, both among the poorest states, have low levels of
inequality, but Bayelsa and Oyo, with lower than average poverty levels, also have low levels of
inequality.

G.

Nigeria as a Regional Player

25.
A number of factors strategically position Nigeria as a potential regional and continental
hub. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation (148 million), and its economy is the second largest in
sub-Saharan Africa and the largest in West Africa. It is richly endowed with natural resources,
notably oil and gas, and is the world’s sixth largest oil exporter. Within the region, Nigeria’s role is
pivotal in free trade agreements, and it is an important player in both the African Union and the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). It serves as a peace agent for conflict
resolution in countries such as Liberia and Sudan. Nigeria provides a potential large market for
smaller neighboring countries and is a potential supplier of goods and services for the sub-region.
Nigeria’s role in strengthening regional integration, its efforts at financial market integration, at ports
and customs modernization, to improve access to energy and sustainable land and water resources,
and to align trade regimes to regional agreements are all important for the region’s development.
II.
A.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR GROWTH

Sustaining and Accelerating Non-oil Growth

26.
Challenges to non-oil growth and reducing poverty are high in spite of good progress in
macroeconomic reforms. Recent agricultural growth has been driven mainly by expansion in area,
while yields of most crops have declined from two decades ago. The growth was fueled by increased
domestic demand from the urban middle class, higher international prices, and restrictive trade
policies. The challenge in this sector is to increase agricultural productivity, both in staples for local
and regional consumption, and in the longer term, for products for export. In manufacturing and
services sectors, and in spite of the large domestic market, only a few producers have been able to
develop into sizeable businesses and to compete internationally. Thus, the first challenge is to remove
constraints that will allow firms to grow to meet domestic demand. This will allow them to improve
their cost structures, become more competitive, and eventually compete on a regional and
international scale. A binding constraint common to the diversification of the economy into
agriculture, manufacturing and service sector, and to reducing poverty is infrastructure, in particular
energy and roads. In energy, with only 3,000 MW of generation available against an estimated
requirement of 10,000 MW, the country is facing long power outages, poor quality of supply, and
low access to electricity. Only about 60% of Nigeria’s population has access to electricity, electricity
consumption per capita has fallen to a low figure of about 155 kWh in 2007, among the lowest in the
world. In the road sector, over 90% of surface transport of goods is by road but the network has
decayed with decades of inappropriate maintenance due to funding shortages and lack of institutional
capacity. Estimates from Federal Ministry of Transport show that the share of federal roads in good
condition is only 15%. The situation for rural roads is equally poor, with more than 30 million rural
inhabitants for whom the nearest road is further than 2 kilometers, hampering agricultural
productivity and access of rural communities to education and health.
27.
Nigeria faces a growing unemployment crisis, which should be addressed by policies
aimed at removing constraints to improving productivity in high potential areas. The recent
report, Employment and Growth, identified a number of sectors with potential for further growth
and employment creation, including, for example, construction, wholesale and retail trade,
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and light manufacturing. The report also
identified significant constraints to further development of these sectors: (i) inadequate physical

8

infrastructure, especially in power and transportation; for ICT, inadequate bandwidth; (ii) lack of
access to finance: (iii) poor investment climate; (iv) shortage of skilled staff; and (v) restrictive
trade policies, including import bans that increase the cost of inputs. In addition, significant
challenges are posed by the rapid urbanization of large cities such as Lagos and environmental
issues such as climate change and gas flaring.
28.
The challenge of increasing agricultural productivity. In the past, government–led
special initiatives, implemented with strong community involvement, have demonstrated good
results. These include the CDD Fadama project that focuses on smallholder production
(supported by the Bank), DFID’s PropCom, and USAID MARKETS that supported marketbased agricultural programs.6 More frequently, however, agricultural policies and programs
changed with political leadership. The challenges will be to adjust sector policies and programs
to provide the incentives and the means for farmers to adopt better technology, to scale up from
subsistence to commercial agriculture, to encourage public-private partnerships (PPP) in
irrigation, and to invest in related infrastructure, including roads and power.
29.
Improvements to the investment climate are crucial. Nigeria ranks poorly on Doing
Business indicators: in 2008, Nigeria was ranked 118 out of 181 countries on the investment
climate. An interesting analysis at the sub-national level has shown that potential exists within
Nigeria for states to improve their investment climates by following policies and practices of the
best-performing states (see Box 1).
Box 1: DFID/WBG Investment Climate Program (ICP) and the Rise of “Nigeriana”
The Investment Climate Program is the first program in Sub-Saharan Africa to analyze the investment climate at a sub-national
level. Combining state level investment climate assessments with analysis from Doing Business, the ICP found large differences
among states. While Nigeria’s overall ranking in 2008 was 118th among 181 countries, the most exciting finding of the analysis
was that if a hypothetical state of “Nigeriana” were to use the practices of the states with the best score in each category,
Nigeriana would rank 51st, alongside Taiwan, Italy, Kuwait and Botswana. This means that if states were to adopt the business
regulations and practices from the top ranking states within Nigeria, their investment climate would improve to international
standards.
For example, the cost of obtaining building permits varies widely across Nigeria, from some 826% of per capita income in Lagos
to 25% of per capita income in Sokoto, the fourth best in the world. There are also substantial differences in the time and cost to
enforce a commercial contract: court performance, a significant factor in recovery of commercial debts, is better in states that
have implemented the new High Court Rules, such as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos and Kaduna. Registering a
business has become much easier across Nigeria, thanks to computerization of the registry and establishment of zonal branches of
the Corporate Affairs Commission and Stamp Duty Offices, but it is fastest in FCT, where its headquarters are located.
Performance of all Nigerian states is weakest in the area of registering property (land and fixed assets). The main source of delays
and high costs relates to the requirement to obtain the Governor’s consent to approve mortgage applications, using land as
collateral. All Nigerian states are low in this area in the global doing business ranking. Nigeria’s top performer on this indicator,
FCT, would rank only 157th out of 178 countries worldwide. This situation could be improved if Governors agreed to waive this
consent requirement for mortgages.
Further findings from enterprise surveys indicate that enterprise competitiveness and performance are hindered across the country
by high costs and inadequacy of infrastructure and modern technology. These findings, both for the country as a whole and
among states, can inform the design of partnership support for non-oil growth.

PropCom focuses on livelihoods of the poor, facilitating development of viable agricultural and service markets
with focus on rice and soya value chains. The MARKETS project aims to improve technologies and management
practices by farmers and strengthen market linkages.

9

30.
Improving skills development and implementing a more liberal trade policy will be
essential. In skills development, Nigeria has particularly low quality of science and technology
education, a smaller number of enrolled and graduates in tertiary education compared to
Nigeria’s population and comparator countries such as Brazil, Malaysia, and Korea. In trade
policy, Nigeria’s trade regime has been liberalized in recent years, with the partial adoption of
ECOWAS’ Common External Tariff (CET) which lowered tariff rates and phased out some nontariff barriers. Nonetheless, Nigeria’s trade regime remains heavily protectionist, resulting in
distortions to the domestic production structure, and constraining development of employmentintensive sectors of the economy. Greater availability of cheaper imports and enhanced access to
export markets will be critical to a restructuring of the Nigerian economy towards competitive
and employment-intensive sectors.
31.
Challenge of improving the financial sector. As a result of banking consolidation,
Nigeria’s financial sector was strengthened. Most banks were, until the recent crisis affected
them, well capitalized, liquid and profitable. Both deposits and bank credit to the private sector
had grown rapidly. The financial sector now faces increased risks, however, including: (i)
through the banks' lending portfolios and their increasing presence abroad which presents
challenges to the banks in managing their risk exposures and to the authorities in ensuring
adequate reporting and disclosure by the banks; (ii) the increased exposure to the stock market,
which heightens the potential for contagion between the banking sector and capital markets;
(iii) the increase in foreign investor presence in the domestic treasury bills and bond markets;
and (iv) the risks that arise when banks become eager to deploy capital in risky activities to
maintain historically high returns on equity. The CPS addresses these concerns both through the
policy actions relating to bank accounting, reporting and supervision which are central to the
proposed federal level Development Policy Operation as well as ongoing and intended further
policy dialogue and technical assistance support to the authorities.
32.
Sustaining growth will also require addressing the serious challenges posed by the
development of mega-cities, Lagos in particular. Its contribution to Nigeria’s GDP is 12 percent
but it also has one of the highest rates of poverty and inequality in the country. By 2010 Lagos,
with over 20 million inhabitants, will be one of the ten most populated cities in the world.
33.
Strategies are needed to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Climate change will
affect agriculture and food security in the coastal areas. In the more sub-humid and semi-arid
zones, climate change is expected to reduce the rate of agricultural growth and welfare because
of lower rainfall, shorter growing seasons, and accelerated land degradation, leading to increased
loss of soil fertility and desert encroachment. Gas flaring is also a major environmental hazard,
causing serious local pollution and contributing to climate change. More gas is flared in Nigeria
than anywhere else in the world. Despite regulation introduced more than 20 years ago to stem
the practice, most associated gas is still flared. The oil and gas operators have been investing in
flare reduction projects for many years, but the pace has been slow. Constraining factors include
a worldwide shortage in the expertise required to design, engineer, and implement the associated
gas utilization projects; the inability of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, which holds 60
percent interest in each oil concession, to fund its share; and security concerns in Delta region.

10

B.

Human Development

34.
Key challenges remain in improving the delivery of social services and social
indicators. As discussed above, poverty and inequality remain high; the progress on economic
growth rates is relatively recent. The poor have lower school enrollment rates and lower
utilization of health services, and across all social service delivery issues is the underlying
challenge of improving state-level governance. While the current strategy addresses this
governance challenge through many initiatives, the approach will of necessity be incremental
and take years to effect significant change.
35.
The main challenges in the education sector include high cost to students and poor
quality. School fees are the largest education expenditure for primary school students, especially
among the poorest, followed by books and supplies, and uniforms. Only about half of the
primary school students pay fees,7 but as these fees tend to be large it is a major reason that poor
students drop out of school. At the junior and senior secondary levels, school fees are important
but not as significant as the cost of transportation. The quality of education is also a challenge:
surveys cited the lack of text books and supplies and low quality of facilities (as well as high
fees); only two out of every three schools have access to water and fewer than one in two has
access to electricity. Other problems include lack of teachers or their poor deployment, poor
quality of teaching, poor supervision, low motivation and inadequate incentives. There is an
absence of accountability/quality mechanisms and limited capacity for policy making,
management, planning and monitoring and evaluation. Many children leave primary and junior
secondary schools without adequate literacy, numeracy and life skills. An education sector
strategy to be supported under the CPS will point to the systems reform in this sector and will
inform partner support.
36.
Health outcomes are determined by a number of factors. These include: (i) increasing
maternal education to increase knowledge of health practices and attendance of skill personnel at
birth; (ii) reducing the costs (and physical accessibility) of health services which are higher for
rural than for urban residents; (iii) addressing the cultural factors which lead to lower utilization
in the Northern regions particularly in North West and North East zones; (iv) reducing
preventable deaths from malaria, diarrhea; (v) increasing vaccination rates; (vi) coordinating
with the parastatal agencies and vertical programs, particularly at the federal level, which also
intervene across the different levels of services; and (vii) focusing on the inadequate drug supply
and equipment in public sector facilities, particularly Primary Health Care (PHC) services.
37.
The community-based organizations (CBOs) and CDD can play a positive role in
influencing health outcomes. CBOs include traditional and kinship institutions, community
associations, occupational associations, women’s groups, ethnic associations, faith based groups,
and more formal non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Going forward there should be a
greater emphasis on leveraging community based interventions in addition to facility based
service delivery. Box 2 describes how CDD was useful in Bayelsa, one of the Niger Delta states,
in dealing with conflict and as a successful intervention for poverty reduction.
7

The National Living Standards Survey asked for expenditure in “school fees and registration”, but did not specify
the type of fees (e.g. tuition, school development levy, exam fees, or other). The Demographic Household Survey
2003 indicated that about 30 percent of children pay tuition fees (12 percent in the poorest quintile), 34 percent pay
school development fees, and 48 percent, exam fees.

11

Box 2: CDD Experience in Bayelsa State of Nigeria - The Case of the Local Empowerment and
Environmental Management Project (LEEMP)
CDD gives control of decisions and resources to community groups. It links participation, community management
of resources, good governance and decentralization principles of development. In the Niger Delta, the Bayelsa State
LEEMP uses the CDD approach to facilitate the implementation of micro-projects in some 110 communities.
LEEMP-supported communities are able to prioritize, implement and operate projects to serve their needs; hire, pay
and discipline those who provide services; charge user fees, be accountable to their people and enable women and
youth to participate in their development agenda. This is important for a region noted for militancy of the youth. The
communities have implemented micro-projects like potable drinking water, teachers’ quarters, classroom and
administrative blocks, health centers and equipment, internal concrete walkways, concrete bridges and culverts,
town halls, auditoriums, rural electricity, cleaning water hyacinths and building toilets.
LEEMP has succeeded in building considerable social capital even in the remote riverine communities of the State.
In Ogu community, for example, the CDD approach was used, without project funds, to build a residential lodge for
Youth Corpers. The LEEMP staff trained community members in book keeping, operation and maintenance,
participatory monitoring and evaluation, project management, and community procurement, which has been applied
to other aspects of community life. The Ayibabiri community rented Evira Lake, for example, to the highest of three
bidders, after competitive bidding. Community members are now interested in how funds earmarked for their
communities are spent, and demand accountability and transparency. In one community, the project management
committee members had to repay funds that had not been used as intended.
Because one of the criteria for participating in LEEMP is that the community must show cohesion, the CDD
approach has provided an incentive to reduce conflicts; it is now common to see communities resolve differences
during community gatherings for Needs Identification and Prioritization, Election of Community Project
Management, and Community and Micro-project Launch. “Youth Vanguards” give special consideration and
“passage” to such LEEMP gatherings. LEEMP is highly regarded even among warring factions and communities in
the State.
The LEEMP experience in Bayelsa State shows that even in a restive environment such as in the Niger Delta,
community members can become initiators, collaborators and resources on which to build poverty reduction
interventions in a transparent and accountable manner.

Governance for Results

38.
Nigeria has achieved progress in recent years on measures of corruption and public
resource management. Since 2005, some, but not all, of the Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings have improved (Table 5). Measures include the passage
of the Procurement, Fiscal Responsibility and EITI Laws in 2007. The passage of the
procurement law was followed by the establishment of the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP),

development of procurement tools, and creation of procurement cadre in the civil service to
enhance procurement capacity. Competitive bidding in federal contracts is now widespread with
significant savings being made but no official statistics.
39.
Challenges remain, however, in implementing effective governance, especially at the
state level. With a population of over 148 million people, 200 ethnic groups, 500 languages, and
two main religions, the size and complexity of the country creates huge challenges. Fiscal
decentralization provides Nigeria’s 36 states and 774 local governments considerable policy
autonomy, control of 50 percent of government revenues, and responsibility for delivery of
public services. Only a few states are making progress in procurement legislation—Bauchi state
has passed the law, while, Kaduna, Cross River and Lagos States have draft laws. Some States
have put in place public procurement offices but few have legislation to provide standards and
safeguards that incorporate good national and international practice. There are also major
shortcomings in public financial management at the state level.
40.
The states and local governments are characterized by particularly weak institutional
capacities. Improving governance will require intensified focus at the state level and will be a
long-term process; it will require support for implementation of policy and not just policy
development. Governance reforms will need to include expansion of the role of the private sector
and a redefinition of the contractual relationships between the public sector, the private sector
and citizens. Other challenges include: limited transparency and accountability in management of
public resources at all levels of government, exacerbated by weak sanctions; low capacity of the
civil service to implement government programs and the need for wide-ranging civil service
reform; an ineffective judiciary system; limited ability of state houses of assembly to play an
effective role and absence of social accountability mechanisms that ensure citizen’s feedback on
government performance and service providers.
41.
A major challenge to improving participation in the public sphere is the lack of
Freedom of Information Bill. The information bill has been outstanding since 2007; lack of
information impedes the ability of civil society and other organizations in the public sphere to
demand accountability, transparency and a more responsive government.

A.

LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
(2005 CPS)

The 2005 CPS

42.
The 2005 CPS was the first full World Bank Group strategy, after several interim
strategies, in over a decade. It was also a joint partnership strategy of the Bank Group and UK’s
DFID. In spite of the modest size of the partners’ contribution relative to Nigeria’s oil revenues
over the 2005 CPS period, the government increased its borrowing from the Bank and use of
grants from DFID. Bank investment lending rose steadily from an average $500 million
commitment per year over FY05-08 to over $1 billion in FY09. DFID’s grants rose from £80
million to £100 million over the period of the CPS.
43.
The 2005 CPS had a strong focus on results. It had three pillars, consistent with the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) framework: (i)

13

improving service delivery for human development (NEEDS: empowering people); (ii)
improving the environment and services for non-oil growth (NEEDS: promoting private
enterprise); and (iii) enhancing transparency and accountability for better government (NEEDS:
changing the way government works). The 2005 CPS progress report adjusted the strategy at the
federal level to increased emphasis on infrastructure, particularly in the power sector.
44.
In addition, the 2005 CPS reflected four key strategic elements. First, it focused on
areas where the Bank could have “quick wins” to establish the Bank’s role, after a relatively
modest presence in Nigeria. Second, it used a lead states approach, which involved selecting
states with committed and capable leaders, and which was to serve as incentives for other states
to improve their governance. Third, the strategy was a formal partnership with DFID. Finally, the
strategy envisaged a gradual increase in IDA resources as governance and capacity improved.
45.
Partners chose a lead state approach to concentrate and leverage resources at the state
level to increase impact, strengthen demand and commitment for reforms. The rationale was
that: (i) the partners’ limited resources could not have significant impact if spread thinly over the
country’s 36 states and 148 million people; (ii) aid effectiveness could be achieved through
concentration of resources in selected states with greater potential for success; and (iii) success in a
few states could be replicated and scaled up through leveraging Nigeria’s own public resources.
B.

Results of the 2005 CPS

46.
In terms of development objectives, the overall outcome was assessed as moderately
satisfactory by the 2005 CPS Completion Report (CPSCR, Annex 2). Moderately satisfactory
progress was made on human development indicators (good on HIV/AIDS, immunization
coverage, primary school enrollment and gender ratio, but stagnation in maternal and child
mortality rates); satisfactory progress on non-oil growth (which included a successful
privatization and port concession program, and other sector specific outcomes), and moderately
satisfactory progress on governance at the federal level, with huge challenges remaining at both
the federal and especially the state levels.
47.
The strategy was successful in establishing a good partnership among donors, underpinning
both lending and, for the first time in Nigeria, non-lending activities. The partnership between the
Bank and DFID was expanded in 2006 when USAID aligned its programs with the 2005 CPS. In the
governance area, key initiatives of the partnership include supporting the Federal Ministry of Finance
(FMoF), National Planning Commission (NPC), Debt Management Office and the BPP. Focused
support to states on public financial management was provided by the Bank and DFID under their
respective lending operations. The Nigerian EITI, ahead in the Africa sub-region with recovery of
about $1 billion owed to the government by oil companies, was supported by DFID and the Bank
under a multi-donor Trust Fund. A state level initiative on the investment climate was undertaken
jointly by the Bank Group and DFID (Box 1). In health, education and HIV/AIDS, USAID forged
closer relationships with the CPS partners, and concentrated investments in Cross River (Kano and
Lagos were already USAID focus states) and signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) in the
lead States of Kano and Cross River. USAID staff participated in the mid-term review and contributed
to the selection of CPS performance indicators and activities.

14

48.
The lead states approach may have provided incentives to other states to improve
governance. After intense policy dialogue, five states were selected in early 2006, but the
process took longer than expected. It has been under implementation for fewer than three years
and it is still too early to assess whether the approach has been effective in concentrating efforts
or in serving as a catalyst to other states. Some states, in an effort to be categorized as a lead state
in the future, made efforts to enhance transparency and accountability and to improve fiscal
performance and the quality of service delivery.
49.
On the other hand, the lead state approach and process raised issues.8 The five lead
states were in only four of the six major geo-political zones and, from a political standpoint, in a
setting where the federal government strives for balance among the six zones, the selection did
not provide sufficient political balance. In addition, the selection of the five states excluded the
poorest, although the five lead states covered some 21 percent of the population and 23 percent
of Nigeria’s poor.9 Third, some state governors whose states had not been selected as lead states
urged the federal government to change or abandon the lead state strategy. Fourth, additional
time was needed to design project interventions and to build capacity to implement them in the
states. Fifth, support to one of the lead states was scaled down and suspended in 2006 when a
joint Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review found evidence of misuse of
funds. Finally, there was no exit strategy for the partnership in the event that a state fell out of
compliance with the selection criteria.
C.

Recommendations for the Bank from the Completion Report of the 2005 CPS

50.
The Completion Report recommended that the Bank focus on: (i) power and transport
to stimulate non-oil growth; (ii) human development efforts at state level, supporting health
systems instead of concentrating resources in vertical disease programs; (iii) CDD approaches
that integrate local and state governments to ensure sustainability and maintenance of
infrastructure, while promoting participation and better governance; (iv) use of more flexible
instruments such as SDPOs in states that have a track record of reform combined with related
investment lending to build capacity or undertake other investments; (v) move away from a lead
state approach; and (vi) expand the partnership by bringing other development partners on board.
D.

Recommendations for the Bank from the Independent Evaluation Group’s (IEG)
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE)

51.
The country team also benefited from an evaluation of the Bank’s performance over
1998-2007 prepared by IEG. The CAE found that during this period, the Bank provided important
assistance to the government, including advice that was considered objective and valuable and that
positively influenced perceptions about Nigeria in the international community. During the period
to mid-2003, however, the Bank had difficulty in clarifying its role. A large number of lending
operations were started, often with an insufficient base of local knowledge; at the same time the
Bank was slow to invest in analytic work. After 2004, the Bank began to provide more effective
support. IEG recommended the use of development policy credits to support states, scaling up

efforts in the power sector, and fine tuning the lead state approach (see Box 3). The CAE also
found that the partnership was able to draw on each agency’s comparative advantage—the Bank’s
capacity to work multi-sectorally and bring its fiduciary discipline to programs, and DFID’s speed
of response and presence on the ground outside Abuja. It recommended that the Bank make greater
use of the potential of the DFID offices at the state level to help design and implement programs.
The proposed strategy takes elements from all of these recommendations.
Box 3: Recommendations for the Bank from IEG in CAE
The Nigeria Country Assistance Evaluation, the World Bank in Nigeria 1998-2007, prepared by IEG, offered the
following recommendations (Bank response in parentheses):
•

The Bank should help re-engineer the system of fiscal transfers to state governments to provide greater
incentives to states to spend resources efficiently. The Bank should consider Development Policy Operations
focused on these transfers, with triggers linked to improvements in state-level budgeting, expenditure controls,
and service delivery (the Bank is moving towards new instruments such as SDPOs and Sector Wide Approaches
(SWAps) to address budgeting and service delivery).

•

The Bank needs to fine-tune the lead state approach, increasing its policy engagement and its analytical work at
the state level, in order to improve service delivery at the state level. A possible evolution would identify states
based on economic importance and adopt a consistent approach to support in these states. Because the Bank
does not have the staff and budget to put teams in each state, it should make more use of its partnership with
DFID (the Partners have moved away from lead states approach to engagement with states based on a
combination of quality of governance, critical needs, and growth potential).

•

The Bank needs to scale up its efforts in the power sector, with the objective of expanding power distribution.
(Bank is scaling up efforts in the power sector).

Recommendations for the IFC from IEG’s Country Impact Review (CIR)

52.
The IEG also conducted a review of IFC’s performance in Nigeria from July 1998—
December 2007, and examined obstacles to private investment in the country. The CIR found
that IFC had achieved strong impact, more so than either a global or Africa regional average, but
did so in a limited range of sectors, with a particular focus on the financial sector (Box 4).
Box 4: Recommendations from IEG’s CIR for IFC
The Nigeria CIR of IFC in Nigeria 1998—2007, by the IEG, offered the following recommendations:
•

Diversify areas of intervention in Nigeria to: (i) help address development challenges related to poor
infrastructure (in particular power and roads) and excessive dependence on the oil sector; (ii) contribute to
trickle-down effects of oil-driven growth; and (iii) expand viable IFC private sector activities beyond the
present narrow confines of operations in terms of sectors. This would involve: (i) more strategic and effective
deployment of advisory services, particularly in infrastructure and related areas; and (ii) close cooperation with
the World Bank to help improve the business environment.

•

Improve the process of developing country assistance strategies for key countries such as Nigeria by: (i)
strengthening the country focus of IFC’s strategy process including enhanced coordination with the World
Bank; (ii) formulating country objectives in terms of expected development impacts; and (iii) linking objectives
with the allocation of organizational resources.

•

Ensure that proper priority and resources are given to the supervision of environmental and social effects in
Nigeria. IFC should fully integrate the environmental and social supervision into the portfolio-management
process, and ensure accountability.

IV.

GOVERNMENT STRATEGIC PRIORITIES AND OUTCOMES OF CONSULTATIONS

53.
In keeping with his inaugural pledge to continue the reform agenda of the previous
administration, President Yar’Adua’s administration has articulated a seven-point agenda that
builds on the earlier administration’s NEEDS and is aimed at “transforming Nigeria into a modern
economy and an industrial nation by 2015 and one of the top 20 economies by 2020”. The current
CPS priorities are driven by the Seven Point Agenda (critical infrastructure, the Niger Delta, food
security, human capital, land tenure changes and home ownership and wealth creation) (see Box 5).
Box 5: The Government’s Seven Point Agenda
•

Critical Infrastructure –The critical infrastructure includes power, transportation, national gas distribution and
telecommunications. In power: develop an integrated, lowest cost, expansion plan for the development of the
Nigerian electricity industry in the medium and long-term; upgrade and reinforce distribution networks; develop
appropriate gas policy to encourage production and supply of gas for electricity generation; develop gas production
and supply infrastructure; and develop a policy on IPPs. In transport: provide platforms for PPP, with capacity
building in Ministries and agencies. In roads, explore mechanisms to ensure funding for maintenance investments.
In railways, revive the system and involve the private sector. In aviation, the priority is to establish the National
Civil Aviation Authority as the cornerstone of reform, including a recertification project

•

The Niger Delta - The Niger Delta region, more than any other region, faces a number of physical and
geographical challenges including environmental degradation, pollution, oil spills and human, economic, social
and political problems. The 7-Point Agenda aims to address the existing issues in the Niger Delta region
through the implementation of the existing Master Plan and appropriate funding of the Niger Delta
Development The implementation of the plan will also result in improving the living standards of the people, as
well as improved governance at the grassroots level.

•

Food Security - Going forward, the emphasis of this government is on the production and development of the
agricultural sector. Improvements in this sector will include the use of modern technology in agricultural
development and financial injection into research which together will lead to an increase in yield and
production. The reforms in the agricultural sector will lead to massive domestic and commercial outputs and the
technological knowledge transfer to local farmers.

•

Human Capital -The provision of health, education and social protection is core to empowering the population
to achieve sustainable national development under the 7-Point Agenda. In education: improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of funds in MDG and Universal Basic Education program implementation, particularly at the state
level; design and implement education reforms at the state level based on Federal education reforms. In health:
define and coordinate health care responsibilities at the federal, state and local government levels; revitalize the
primary health care system; utilize potential of PPP; increase access to Anti-retroviral drugs; reduce infant and
child mortality rates; achieve 100 percent success rate in child immunization; and provide Nigerians with easy
access to health insurance.

•

Land Tenure Changes and Home Ownership - Nigeria ranks as the most populous country in Africa, with
approximately 64% residing in the rural areas. The pressure of rural-urban migration is currently impacting on
the social amenities and infrastructure in the major metropolitan areas and as such urgent action is required to
provide sufficient affordable housing. The 7-Point Agenda proposes changes in the land laws.

•

National Security - Addressing the country’s security is a high priority of the present administration. In this
regard, the government plans to create a Central Directorate of Intelligence and also encourage more
neighborhood policing to curb the crime rate The general welfare and conditions of service of the men and
officers of the Police Force will be improved as a morale boost to discourage corruption.

•

Wealth Creation - To reduce the level of poverty, the government is determined to create more wealth by
creating an enabling environment for economic growth and increase in the personal incomes of individual
citizens. The government will concentrate on areas such as skills development for productivity and wealth
creation, facilitating access to credit for small to medium sized businesses and the self employed.

54.
Consultations were held with federal and state level government officials and
representatives of Civil Society Organizations (CSO) in September 2008, in preparation for
this CPS. The recommendations from these meetings (Box 6) agree for the most part with those
of the CPSCR and IEG. They presented different options for engaging with states, with
geopolitical representation, and using transparent, well publicized criteria. They requested
stronger communication between the government and civil society, the government and the
private sector, and donors and civil society.
Box 6: Voices of the Stakeholders
Meetings with stakeholders produced the following recommendations:
•

Improving governance is at the top of the list of priorities. Most stakeholders thought that the development
partners should focus on ensuring effective use of oil revenues, and greater accountability of government
agencies. The need for improved governance and capacity at the state and local government levels was a strong
theme.

•

Lead state selection should be reviewed. Options include: (i) select one state from each of the six geopolitical
zones and within each zone, rank the states on their policies and ability to deliver on their commitments; (ii)
work with states that have already implemented service delivery; or (iii) work with states where there is little or
no government presence. Whatever criteria are used, they should be well publicized.

•

Development partners should focus on energy, implementation of MDGs and implementation of recently passed
laws.

•

Better communication is needed between government and civil society, government and the private sector, and
donors and civil society.

55.
The consultations were followed up by meetings at the highest level with the FMoF in
April 2009 and the Minister of Planning, NPC in May 2009. The Ministers welcomed the
flexibility in supporting the government, particularly during the financial crisis, endorsed the
participation of a larger number of partners in the current CPS, and the three pillar approach,
with governance as both a pillar and cross-cutting theme (which is the same approach followed
by NPC in its long term development plan for Nigeria—Vision 2020). They also endorsed the
focus on agriculture in stimulating non oil growth and on reducing maternal and child mortality
rates. They made specific suggestions which have been reflected in this CPS as follows: (i) adopt
lessons learned from the 2005 CPS; (ii) ensure clarity on what the partners will do, donor
coordination and utilization of resources in a targeted way to achieve impact; (iii) include
support for customs reform, revenue enhancement, public sector reform, carbon credits and
country-level Monitoring and Evaluation framework for Vision 2020; (iv) focus on domestic led
growth, which should lead to increasing Nigeria’s competitiveness in international markets; (v)
emphasize infrastructure, particularly power, and support for PPP to leverage resources; (vi)
include state level indebtedness in eligibility criteria for state level development policies loans;
and (vii) disseminate strategy with states at governors’ forum.
56.
The Federal government confirmed the need for enhanced focus at the state level in
the strategy but also a move away from the lead state approach towards broader coverage of
states with particular attention to geopolitical representation. Officials preferred that CDD and
Human Development projects cover all states. While they agree that focus on Northern states for
human development is appropriate, they do not want other states to be deprived of these
resources. Officials also support more resources for health systems but not at the cost of less
support for vertical disease programs. They also showed a keen desire to learn from the
18

experience of other countries for example, through South-South exchanges. The officials
emphasized the need for faster and more effective support from the Bank.

A.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (2010-13)

Emphasis on Flexibility

57.
The situation in Nigeria has changed considerably since the outset of the strategy
formulation. When work began on formulating the CPS in September 2008, the global crisis was
just beginning to emerge and had not yet touched Nigeria. Since then, as discussed in Section I,
the Nigerian economy has begun to feel the effects of the crisis. As a result, the partnership is
supporting the government, as an integral part of its assistance program, in dealing with the
impact of the global crisis.10 The Bank is proposing a federal level DPO in early FY10 to support
the government’s response to the financial crisis (see para. 91 for discussion of this operation);
the DPO is presented with the CPS. Going forward, if the government requests Bank support for
continued policy reform, the Bank would respond by adjusting the program to include
programmatic DPOs at the federal level, as well as capacity building through technical assistance
to deepen financial sector and budgetary reforms. Obviously, significant support directed at
mitigating the impact of the global crisis or strengthening the financial and public sectors will
have implications for the remainder of the support program, because of limitations on both the
total financial envelope and human resources available for the program of support. Thus the
indicative, detailed support program laid out below may be modified in light of demand for
crisis-mitigation related assistance. Any significant changes to the program described below
would be reported in the Progress Report for this CPS.
B.

The Partnership

58.
Under this CPS, the partnership will be expanded to include the AfDB and USAID as
well as DFID and the World Bank Group, in line with the government and CPSCR
recommendations. The partners account for over 80 percent of Nigeria’s development
assistance. By agreeing to a single joint strategy, partners will strengthen the likelihood of
increasing development effectiveness. Partners will also continue to coordinate closely with
Nigeria’s other main development partners, including the UN funds, programs and agencies,
Japanese International Cooperation Agency, the French Agency for International Development,
Canadian International Development Agency and the European Commission. Some of these
partners expect to join the partnership during the CPS period.
59.
Unlike a number of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, donor presence is small in
Nigeria and division of labor is relatively straightforward. The concentration of official
agencies in Abuja makes for easy and effective collaboration among the donor community.
While the Bank is engaged in a relatively large number of sectors, within these sectors it is
engaged in few areas (for example only roads in the transport sector). Within each sector, the
donors are identifying an appropriate division of responsibility based on each agency’s
comparative advantage; the sector groups meet periodically to coordinate activities. For example,
in the transport sector, the AfDB and the Bank are co-financing the rehabilitation and
10

Government is also in consultation with the IMF on a possible Policy Support Instrument but has not yet agreed
on scope and content.

19

maintenance of the Federal road linking Nigeria to Cameroon and supporting the government in
the implementation of the Rural Travel and Transport Policy; and the Bank and AfDB are
financing a Rural Access and Mobility Project in different states. In the energy sector, DFID
supported the Bank Energy Policy Notes on governance and performance benchmarks, USAID
financed gas policy analysis, and AfDB and the French Development Agency are proposing
significant investment with the Bank in the power sector. In private sector development, DFID
has supported the analysis for the Bank’s GEMS project (FY10), and has worked with the Bank
in the ICP (Box 1). In education, DFID, USAID, and the Bank are currently supporting girls’
education in Northern Nigeria, each focusing on a different aspect. In health, DFID and the Bank
are coordinating their response to HIV/AIDs.
C.

Strategic Focus

60.
In addition to support in response to the global crisis, the partnership will focus on the
three themes of (i) improving governance, (ii) maintaining non-oil growth and (iii) promoting
human development (i.e., as identified in the Seven Point Agenda and reaffirmed in
stakeholder consultations) to transform Nigeria’s economy. Governance will be both a core
theme and, because it is fundamental to achieving results in the other two areas, is also a crosscutting theme, an integral part of virtually every form of support. Each partner will focus on
these three areas, with varying degrees of emphasis.
c.1

Governance as a core theme

61.
To achieve better governance, this CPS will focus on how we can help the government
strengthen its own systems over the long term and will cover five focal areas. Based on
stakeholder consultations, and the comparative advantage of partners, those five areas will be: (i)
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources; (ii) participation of communities
in decision making and oversight of public resources; (iii) governance reforms in high priority
sectors to promote diversification of the economy, non-oil growth, private sector participation
and human development; (iv) capacity development in the public service; and (v) judicial reform
and democratic governance. All partners will engage in strengthening government systems to
improve outcomes in human development and growth, while only DFID and USAID will focus
on work in judicial reform and democratic processes. These five areas are discussed next.
62.
Strengthening transparency and accountability will involve building on progress under the
previous CPS to strengthen federal and state systems for procurement, internal auditing and
internal control functions, statistical capacity and public financial management to allow Nigeria
to better manage its resources. Current achievements include publication of a large percent of
federal government’s contract awards above a threshold and establishment of the Bureau of Public
Procurement, both important steps to improving value for money at the Federal Government level. In
line with the strategy of strengthening government systems, the current CPS will continue to focus on
improving effectiveness of anti-corruption institutions, value for money and transparency in the
public procurement system, and improving budgeting and auditing and accounting at the federal and
state levels. The strategy sets monitorable results expected to be achieved for the CPS period (Annex

20

1, pillar 3).11 It will also continue to support EITI, the global initiative to support good governance
and transparency in resource rich countries. The objective will be to help Nigeria complete the EITI
validation process and therefore become EITI compliant.
63.
Greater participation calls for improvement in the public sphere through the involvement
of CSOs, CBOs, and other stakeholders in the governance reform process (e.g., monitoring
budget expenditures and service delivery at the state and federal levels). This approach has been
piloted in some states and will continue in education, health, power, transport, as well as in public
procurement. Building on the solid foundation of the successful CDD approach, the current CPS
will include increased CSO and community monitoring and evaluation, planning and budgeting at
sector and local levels, and will pilot new participatory approaches for monitoring and evaluation
and service delivery at the local levels. Regular consultations will be planned with CSOs, including
NGOs, academic institutions and the private sector, on the design, implementation and supervision
of projects and AAA as appropriate. To enable them to play their roles more effectively, the
partners will support systematic initiatives to strengthen the capacity of CBOs, CSOs, and the
media, and will encourage government to pass the Freedom of Information Bill.
64.
Governance reforms in high priority sectors include health, education, power,
agriculture and water. The areas to be covered are public expenditure management,
development of sector strategies, strengthening of sector institutions and improving the policy
and regulatory environment (Box 7).
65.
Capacity development in the public service at the federal, state, and local levels. CPS
will provide support for public sector reform, strengthening the capacity of government to
formulate and implement policy and serve as regulators. Government planning and statistical
capacity building will also be important. The partnership will also support selected universities
and think tanks to undertake analytic work to inform public policy. It will promote exchange of
experiences through South South exchanges.12
66.
Justice sector reform and democratic governance will be supported by DFID and
USAID building on existing programs (including USAID/DFID Strengthening the National
Assembly Program (SNAP), and DFID Security Justice and Growth (SJG), and USAID’s Local
Governance Program). Strengthening the efficiency, equity and accessibility of Nigeria’s justice
sector promotes growth by providing efficient property and contract law, ensuring security for
people and property. Support to strengthen democracy, including electoral reform in Nigeria
through work with the national and state assemblies, media, and civil society on key issues, will
increase the public’s voice and enable citizens to articulate its demands to government for
quantity, quality, and timelines of services. This will in turn increase government accountability.
11
DFID’s State Partnership for Accountability Responsiveness and Capability (SPARC) program and State
Accountability and Voice Initiative (SAVI) will improve accountability and transparency in five states (Kano, Lagos,
Kaduna, Enugu and Jigawa), where SPARC has facilitated a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment. Support from SPARC will vary between states, but will cover areas including budget preparation, budget
execution, cash and debt management, audit and procurement. USAID’s Advocacy Awareness and Civic Empowerment,
Local Governance and Decentralization, and Media Strengthening Programs will work to increase the capacity of civil
society and the media to advocate and report on key policy reforms such as revenue and budget transparency, access to
information, electoral reform and to fight corruption through public oversight, agencies, and initiatives in up to four states.
12
The Bank established a new South-South Experience Exchange Facility, a multi-donor trust fund promoting the
idea that development success in one country can be relevant for reducing poverty in another.

21

Box 7: Governance to Promote More Effective Use of Public Resources is Central to this CPS
Federal level: In the area of public financial management, a Fiscal Responsibility law and new procurement law were
passed in 2007 at the federal level and similar laws are being adopted in all states. The Accounting Transactional
Recording and Reporting System was rolled out, and a computerized federal payroll management system was launched.
Preparations for the adoption of the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System are being made
and an E-payment system introduced in 2008 promises to increase transparency and accountability further.
Cross-cutting themes in sector governance are: (i) accountability and transparency; (ii) participation; and (iii) capacity
building. Sectors have been addressing these themes as follows:
Education: School–Based Management Committees have been supported by Bank and DFID projects to ensure the
proper use of resources and hold service providers (teachers and schools) accountable for good quality education of
children. A major area that will strengthen governance will be the support to CSOs to enable them monitor disbursements
especially under the Universal Basic Education act. Scaling up the Community Accountability and Transparency Initiative
will go a long way to improving governance in the education sector
Health: Under the Health Systems Development Program, village development committees have been established to
jointly manage with the local governments the renovated health facilities as well as plan for the delivery of health services.
Similarly, under the Malaria Booster Project, communities are being encouraged to manage the distribution of bed nets
and malaria medicines.
Water: The implementation of the World Bank National Urban Water Reform Projects and analytical work on the
“Governance of Service Delivery”, and USAID support for local governance to provide water and sanitation services will
enable the development of frameworks for assessing accountability and responsiveness. The aim will be to develop
measurable service standards for State Water Boards.
Power: The Bank is undertaking AAA in the energy sector covering sector governance, institutional issues, finances,
tariffs and subsidies and on the political economy of the electricity sector. The Bank is also providing a partial risk
guarantee (PRG) to encourage private sector participation in the energy sector. Through the PRG, Governance and AntiCorruption measures will be addressed by promoting transparency and commercial benchmarks in transactions,
introducing anti theft and loss reducing pilots, and supporting the regulatory framework. The Ministry of Power is also
expected to convene a bi-annual stakeholder consultation to facilitate dissemination and discussion on overall power sector
reform, and project implementation and safeguard issues.
Civil Society: “TA carried out in this CPS will include the design of social accountability initiatives to improve citizens’
involvement in public procurement process at state and local levels, DFID support through its Coalitions for Change program
will focus on key governance issues including constitutional reform, anti-corruption, and climate change. USAID’s is
working with nation-wide coalitions and local CBO alliances on public expenditure tracking, fiscal responsibility, Nigeria’s
Extractive Industry Initiatives, conflict mitigation and management, and advocacy on key issues including the Freedom of
Information and Public Procurement bills. The “Governance for Service Delivery” AAA planned under this CPS would
support mechanisms to track service delivery in sectors such as water, health, education and power.
Financial Sector: A Banking sector review recommended that Nigeria adopt International Financial Reporting Standards
to improve accounting and auditing standards. The Bank also recommended that Nigeria move to a consolidated financial
year end which would improve transparency and accountability and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced in
April 2009 that it would do so. The Bank is supporting new microfinance banks that publish quarterly reports on: (i)
number of customers; (ii) loans outstanding; (iii) non-performing loan levels; and (iv) profitability. In addition, the Bank
will review Development Finance Institutions to assess their governance structures and procedures.

The focus will be on removing key constraints, in a targeted manner, to private sector
growth. In the near term, Nigerian firms have potential to continue to grow to meet domestic
22

demand, and to become internationally competitive within the next few years. The objective of
the assistance would be to provide the environment where Nigerian firms could increase
efficiency so that they would be able to compete in regional and international markets in the
longer term. The focus of the growth strategy will therefore be on removing identified
constraints to improving agricultural productivity, critical for poverty reduction, and promoting
fast growing sectors (entertainment, ICT, meat and leather, construction, wholesale and retail
trade and hospitality) where there is also potential for employment creation. This will involve
targeting interventions in: (i) physical infrastructure to support growth clusters in identified
geographic areas, such as in Lagos (Annex 5) and Kano-Kaduna; (ii) investment climate
improvement through selective efforts to streamline bureaucracy in land registration, planning
approvals and building permits; (iii) technical and vocational education to address skills gaps;
and (iv) reducing import bans and high tariff barriers. The ongoing micro, small and medium
enterprise project supports performance and employment in these enterprises in selected non oil
industry sub-sectors. The access to finance component has successfully established five new
microfinance institutions and has provided loans of more than $35m. This component of the
project could be scaled up in a follow-on financial sector project.
68.
IFC’s strategy over the next few years emphasizes diversification through increased
focus on agribusiness and infrastructure, in particular power (Annex 3). Three elements are
prominent in the strategy:
a) Increased diversification through: (i) proactive project and business development, (ii)
developing new investment and partnership opportunities with existing IFC clients
and partners in Nigeria and within Africa and (iii) strategic engagement through
advisory services to improve the business environment. Priority will be on power and
agribusiness activities, in line with the government’s priorities. Other sectors of
interest include health and education, and local content business within oil, gas and
mining, the predominant industry in the Niger-Delta region.
b) Diversification within financial markets, from traditional banking credit lines to new
products such as trade finance, housing finance, insurance, Micro, Small Medium
Enterprises (MSME), finance, microfinance and structured finance products, targeting
agribusiness, health and education sectors. IFC will also work with Nigerian financial
institutions to respond to the impact of the global recession, and ensure their
continued financial strength.
c) Advisory and investment services to enhance private sector development in Nigeria,
including addressing key investment climate constraints such as increased power
generation and distribution, capacity building and developing the local fixed income
capital markets, and credit bureaus. These services can also directly support IFC
investments such as project development and sustainability initiatives. IFC will
continue to support the ICP with IDA and DFID.
c.3

Improving human development

69.
The partnership will support improvements to increase the access, quality, efficiency,
equity, and utilization of the services for human development with an intensive focus at the

23

state level. The strategy is selective and tailored to take into account the significant diversity of
health and education needs across the regions. In education, the focus will be to assist the
government in designing a strategy that defines the role of the government at all three levels and
entry points for the private sector-- recognizing that the government and public resources alone
will not be able to address the poor quality of education and learning outcomes identified in
section 1. Another area of emphasis in line with the non-oil growth strategy is skills development
under the New Economy Skills for Africa Program in Information and Communication and
Technologies (NESAP-ICT) initiative, support to Vocational and Innovation Enterprise
institutions, continued focus under the current project on science and technology and cooperation
with South Korea to learn from its highly successful technical and vocational systems (para 102).
Focus will also be on girls’ education in the North (Box 8). In health, the priority will be
reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Partners will, however, continue to support specific
initiatives in vertical disease programs, although on a more modest scale than in the past and
with greater emphasis on health system strengthening.13 The partnership will also pay attention
to increasing the access and utilization of human development services by the extreme poor and
vulnerable. Nevertheless, these approaches are of necessity incremental and given the size of the
challenges at the state level, outcomes of partner activities are likely to modest over the four
years of the strategy’s implementation.
Box 8: Giving Girls A Voice in Northern Nigeria: Three-pronged Strategy to Address Girls Education
Northern Nigeria has particularly large gender inequities in participation rates in school and cultural/religious issues
that pose barriers to girls’ enrollment and primary school completion. Nigerian education and gender MDGs are offtrack due mainly to the situation in the Northern States like Kano, Jigawa, and Bauchi.
The partners, UNICEF and civil society (such as Action Aid) propose three strategies. First, support for the
Islamiyya, Qur’anic and Tsangaya Education integration strategy, to integrate secular and religious schooling
demands in the Northern States. In Kano, this means forming partnerships between Islamic schools (23,135 schools)
and the formal public secular schools (4,000 schools) to: (i) support the integration of a basic curriculum for literacy
and numeracy into Islamic schools; and (ii) provide religious education in state schools, which reduces the need for
separate evening Islamic schools. This satisfies parents’ demand for Islamic education while increasing demand for
secular education, and will help bring boys and girls, but girls in particular, into the secular schools.
Second, target improvements in quality and access to education. This will be done through the Bank’s State
Education Sector Project, DFID’s Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN), DFID-UNICEF
Girls’ Education Programme (GEP), and USAID’s Northern Education Initiative and Teacher Training Initiative.
These programs will pilot innovative ways to support decentralized, community-level responses to improve access
and quality of basic education, particularly for girls. These will build on successes in advocacy and community
mobilization developed in the DFID-UNICEF GEP, USAIDs Action Aid’s programs, which built coalitions for
greater accountability and responsiveness in the delivery of public services, particularly for disadvantaged groups
such as girls in Northern Nigeria.
Third, to address demand side issues by promoting CCT for girls education and orphans in Kano and Bauchi, with
support of the MDG Fund, Bank, DFID and UNICEF. The CCT is a demand-side intervention which has
successfully brought junior secondary schooling to a generation of girls, and which has been successfully
implemented in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Turkey (World Bank, forthcoming, 2009). For example, as a result of
CCT, there are more girls than boys in secondary schools in Bangladesh—a dramatic reversal from just 10 years
ago. For Kano the CCT for Girls Education will be piloted immediately under the Banks education project.
13

Even in vertical disease programs, such as the national malaria control program, partners are moving towards a
more programmatic approach, with support channeled to national strategic plans. This will enable partners to
recognize the financial contributions of other partners in geographical and technical areas, and to be more selective
in their choice of States/areas to support.

24

D.

Partnership Support at the Federal and State levels
d.1

Support at Federal Level

70.
In governance, the partnership is engaged in a number of initiatives to strengthen
procurement, public financial management, and civil service reform. These initiatives will be
continued in this CPS under the Economic Reform and Governance Project (ERGP) jointly
funded by the Bank and DFID, two regional Institutional Development Funds for the Forum of
Accountant Generals and Auditor Generals in West Africa and the Association of Accountancy
Bodies West Africa and USAID’s Local Governance and Decentralization Program. Partners
will continue to fill critical gaps.14 DFID will work with the Governors Forum and partners to
develop an approach to supporting states with the preparation and implementation of Fiscal
Responsibility and Public Procurement legislation. The Federal Government with DFID
technical assistance has prepared a National Strategy for Public Service Reform, with which this
strategy is aligned. Support for public financial management reform will include:
•
•
•
•

•

Modernizing the internal audit function and improvement in internal controls at
federal and state levels;
Strengthening the capacity of external audit and Public Accounts Committees at
state and federal level to enable them perform their oversight roles more effectively;
Strengthening the financial reporting infrastructure;
Updating the Finance (Control and Management) Act and the Audit Act which will
improve accountability and clarify roles and responsibilities for the various PFM
functions. The required standards and disclosure requirements will support
transparency for the use of public funds in a timely manner; and
Strengthening and consolidating procurement systems and practices.

71.
The partnership will continue to support statistics through strengthening national, zonal
and state capacity to collect, compile, analyze, and publish statistical information and
coordinating statistical activities between National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), zonal offices, the
states and Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). In the 2005 CPS, DFID has been
supporting NBS through the Bank’s ERGP project (see Annex 4 for partner support on statistical
capacity building. The results matrix (Annex 1, pillar 3) sets milestones expected to be achieved
under this CPS for strengthening of the national statistical system.
72.
The partnership will engage at the Federal level in policy dialogue to identify constraints,
critical cross-sector and institutional linkages, and needed reforms. Examples of the cross-sector
nature of reforms include the need for simultaneous reform of gas and power tariffs, improved
management of unbundled energy companies, and strengthened implementation of infrastructure
projects. Bank support will continue to coordinate with DFID’s Nigerian Infrastructure Advisory
Facility. Other initiatives at the Federal level will consist of investments and institutional changes in
14

As an example of this: following states’ commitments in 2007 to pass state fiscal responsibility and procurement
laws, the Bank and partners held clinics to familiarize state officials with the laws and underlying concepts. In 2008,
the partners agreed to support a secretariat to the Governors’ Forum to: (i) assemble information on fiscal policy and
associated reforms at the state level and (ii) manage technical assistance to build capacity at the state level. This
process could play an important role in strengthening fiscal federalism in Nigeria.

25

energy, transport, tertiary education, and ICT, all of which will support non-oil growth. The Bank
will also support business climate and capacity building, through on-demand AAA and policy notes,
IFC advisory services and training, drawing on best practices and lessons adapted from global
experience to the Nigeria setting. Strengthening knowledge and training institutions in selected
universities and think thanks to undertake analytical work that inform public policy; and support to
the Lagos Business School and public service training institutions will continue.
73.
The partnership will focus on addressing investment constraints in sectors with the
highest growth and employment potential, including the promotion of cluster-based growth
and skills development. Analysis suggests that light manufacturing, ICT, construction, wholesale
and retail, entertainment, agriculture, meat and leather and the financial sector may be
particularly promising. The CPS will aim at addressing the constraints to growth through several
projects including the DFID’s and Bank’s joint GEMS project and USAID projects including
MARKET II and Trade Capacity Development. The analytic work carried out by the partnership
on the investment climate will inform interventions. Important aspects of stimulating non-oil
growth will be the development of a national skills development framework and the reform of
trade policy, which have been elaborated in the Employment and Growth study. The ongoing
Bank Science & Technology in Post Basic Education Project and Lagos Eko Secondary
Education projects are both directed at skills development. The Science and Technology project
is targeted to post basic education level including vocational and technical education and Lagos
Eko Secondary Education to secondary schools including vocational and technical colleges in
Lagos state. In addition, the FY08 Federal Roads project will support the Federal Government’s
aim to promote private sector participation in the provision and upkeep of roads and will enhance
the impact of the rural roads projects planned under this CPS as well as Fadama III (FY09). IFC
will play a catalytic role in the growth of Agribusiness and Infrastructure (particularly Power).
74.
Support for PPP will be scaled up. Grant funding for diagnostic work and upstream capacity
building ongoing since 2008 has positioned Nigeria for more in-depth support for PPP investments
through a project in FY11. This project—building on the achievements and lessons learned from the
Privatization Support Project scheduled to close in 2009 would enable Nigeria to access top
transactions advisory expertise, and to twin this with focused capacity building and technical
assistance in the key MDAs at federal and sub-national levels that will develop, implement and
oversee the PPP pipeline. As part of this project, given the importance of risk mitigation and
commercial viability to successful PPP initiatives the Bank, including MIGA and IFC, are also
examining the potential to deploy risk guarantees and other form of financing to complement
government investments and to crowd-in other sources of private sector and official funding.
75.
To promote agricultural growth, the partnership will support government goals to
eliminate fertilizer subsidies and improve agricultural finance, strengthen the agricultural input
systems, support the introduction of agricultural support services, build a system of agricultural
research at the federal and state levels and encourage public-private partnerships in irrigation. In
addition, the partnership will support government goals to promote food security and integration
of rural farmers into the market food chain, focusing on the use of inputs, improved varieties,
and mechanization by poor farmers. A key focus will be to link producers to markets through
expanded collaboration with agro-processors and supermarkets. And finally the World Bank in
partnership with the African Development Bank will scale up access to rural roads to a larger
number of states than those covered under the current rural access and mobility project.

26

76.
Underscoring the need for measures to slow down climate change, a program of
support on environmental risks will include components in operations such as in agriculture
and support for government actions to reduce gas flaring. Recognizing that the low price of gas
used domestically distorted incentives towards exporting and encouraged gas flaring, the
government enacted a transitional domestic gas pricing framework that moves prices
progressively to cost-reflective levels. Other measures being launched include Domestic Gas
Supply Obligations for gas companies (meeting these before export) and the introduction of
bilateral commercially enforceable contracts between international oil companies and all endusers, including power companies. These measures are expected to help reduce gas flaring and
are being supported by the Bank under its FY09 Energy project and by USAID’s FLARED
project, also launched in 2009. Partnership between IDA and the Global Environment Fund
(GEF) on a climate management project will address coastal flooding/erosion and disaster
management, and sustainable land management.
77.
Under human development, the partnership will also continue to support Federal
programs through both lending and non-lending. Through diagnostic work, the partnership will
work with the government on a social safety net agenda that can help respond to the global crisis
as well as improve targeted programs such as the CCT and the Youth Empowerment and
Employment Program. The existing Conditional Grant Scheme for MDG interventions, currently
funded by Nigeria’s MDG office in partnership with State and Local Governments, presents a
credible platform for building a sustainable Social Safety Net Program. The partnership will also
support the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal level parastatals to strengthen their role as
stewards of the sector. A programmatic AAA on ‘Governance of Service Delivery’ will underpin
and highlight sector level governance issues. AAA on financing of Tertiary Education will also
provide the basis to fashion appropriate support to students such as student loan schemes.
d.2

Partnership support at the state level

78.
Partners will no longer seek to agree on a single set of lead states among all partners,
or use the same process to identify states with which they engage, as partners are at slightly
different stages and have different operational constraints. In line with government priorities,
CDD will be available to all States and vertical programs will be increasingly integrated within
health systems. Support for investments in economic growth (through GEMs) will be based on
geographical clusters, as will partner programs dealing with food scarcity or humanitarian crises.
For all other interventions, partners will use criteria for state-level engagement that include
geopolitical balance, governance capability and commitment, need, existing programs and
partner objectives (Table 6). Building on lessons learned in the 2005 CPS, including the
relatively low capacity of most state governments to implement and sustain reforms, the
governance criteria will be central to maximize effectiveness of development partner assistance
(Table 6, column 2).
79.
The criteria for state-level engagement reflect the Nigerian government’s priorities and
concerns and lessons from the 2005 CPS: (i) partners should focus their efforts on states with
the greatest needs; (ii) reflect joint decision making with the government; and (iii) recognize that
while not all donors can be in every state, donors should balance funds across Nigeria’s six
geopolitical zones. During the current CPS, partners will support states in each zone, or more if
the state engagement of non CPS development partners is taken into account.

80.
Enhanced governance-focused support will be provided to states which meet
transparent and objective standards for improved governance. Partners will have governancefocused engagement with states from all six geopolitical zones. Partners will not necessarily
provide assistance to the same states, although there is likely to be overlap in the larger states
(Lagos and Kano), and in the states active in 2005 CPS (Kaduna, Enugu, Cross River). USAID
plans to focus on Bauchi and Sokoto states. The remaining states will be selected from those that
have requested support under the Bank’s State Governance and Caoacity Development Project
(SGCBP) II (FY10) based on the governance criteria in Table 6.15 Over the current CPS period,
DFID will extend the coverage of its suite of state level programs into two new states, following
the criteria in Table 6 for state selection.
81.
In HD, performance under existing partner programs will be the primary
consideration for the Bank. All states, for example, have received Bank CDD projects, but not
all have had a satisfactory performance in financial management and procurement, essential for
tracking and ensuring effective use of resources. Additional criteria will be: (i) low ranking on
related indicators such as maternal and child mortality and school attendance rates, and therefore
greatest need for state-based HD interventions; and (ii) demonstrated necessary commitment to
sector reform. The partnership will explore the use of innovative approaches such as CCTs,
performance-based reward system for the Youth Employment Scheme, Modernizing Secondary
Education, Vocational Educational Training, and the Health Insurance Program. In FY10 the
partnership will seek Education for All-Fast Track Initiative support to three or four additional
states to develop education sector plans that can be financed using national and possibly partner
resources.
15

SGCBP II will also provide funding to other states (outside the four selected) for preparation of draft fiscal
responsibility and procurement bills as well as public expenditure reviews and public expenditure and financial
accountability reviews, if they have not already been completed. This will prepare the states for more
comprehensive support under SGCDP III from FY12, and eventually for state level development policy loans.

28

82.
Partners will disseminate and replicate good practices across states. An example of this
is DFID’s support to land registries (Box 9).
Box 9: State to State Replication of Land Registry Reforms
Replication can be designed into the current CPS projects from the outset. In DFID's SJG program under the 2005
CPS, the intention was to support the most advanced registry (Lagos) to become a “center of excellence” which
could then be used as an example to other states. Staff from other registries, both from states where the project was
active but also from other states, was actively encouraged and supported to see the advances that Lagos had made.
This “home-based” example was far more powerful than taking registry staff overseas to see “state-of-the-art” but
ultimately unrealistic models. Lagos staff were also encouraged to speak at events both within Nigeria and
internationally to outline the problems they had faced and the solutions they had developed. One of the links
developed was between Lagos and Kano. Replication did not stop here; the work in Kano land registry was
explicitly designed to increase Kano's training capacity so that they could become the training hub for the northern
states of Nigeria. This capacity now exists—not just for basic land administration and computing issues but also
more advanced geographic information systems training, and Enugu, Jigawa and Bauchi states have benefited from
this training. Further South, staff that had been trained under the SJG program in Enugu has trained staff from
Benue, and in this way the replication of process, capacity and skills has been completed.

83.
To ensure accountability for service delivery, collaboration with civil societies and the
private sector will be encouraged and incorporated within projects, program design, and
implementation. MDAs and project implementation units implementing human development
projects will be encouraged to involve NGOs and the private sector in the delivery and
monitoring as well as evaluation of the impact of their interventions. Examples of how civil
society and democratic governance support service delivery will be documented and shared
among partners. The use of Citizen’s Score Card, Beneficiary Assessment and Report, Civil
Society Independent Evaluation and other participatory feedback mechanisms will be
emphasized in project design and implementation—especially through the supervision of
ongoing operations. Partners will: (i) support the development and implementation of service
standards; (ii) strengthen complaints handling mechanisms; and (iii) support public expenditure
reviews.
84.
Enhanced donor coordination on the ground will increase the effectiveness of partner
assistance. Donors will coordinate efforts better within states where more than one donor is
working. Donors will speak to Federal and State Governments with one voice to minimize
transaction costs, and will work to develop State-level MOUs to monitor progress and enable
mutual accountability. Donors will jointly determine with NPC and Finance which states they
work in.
85.
Lending instruments will be tailored to the conditions of each state. In states selected
based on poor HD indicators or potential for growth, but with a relatively weak public sector
reform track record, the partnership will continue to use project-based lending and grants, while
using these projects as entry points for broader reforms (for example, states supported under the
SGCBP I and II could become eligible for broader multi sectoral reforms with state level
development policy loans). In states with poor HD indicators that have embarked on public
sector reform and have a stronger track record on governance/fiduciary systems (e.g., Sokoto in
the North or Osun in the South), the partnership will work with state governments to develop
comprehensive, prioritized, costed state-wide sectoral plans/programs that will serve as an
overall framework for financial and technical support to the state from the partnership. Also,

29

building on the lessons learnt and inputs from the states regarding the effectiveness of the
project-based approach for challenges and issues that cut across multiple sectors (Annex 5), the
Bank would consider other instruments/options when dealing with multi-sector issues.
86.
Given the importance of improving governance at the state level, and the relative
autonomy enjoyed by states in policy making and budgetary and fiscal management, enhanced
governance assistance could be effectively addressed by use of SDPOs. In states that have a
relatively good track record on public sector reforms, a reasonably strong fiduciary system and
low debt levels, the Bank will discuss with FMoF the use of SDPOs, possibly twinned with TA
operations; other partners will consider whether and when to move to programmatic support.
Providing reformist states with SDPO support could also produce incentives for other states to
follow their example, even if the SDPO amounts are relatively modest compared to the states’
other resources.
87.
At present, Lagos appears to be the best candidate for a “pioneer” SDPO, given the
quality of its PFM-system, the reform-orientation of the state government, the importance of
the state for Nigeria and the inadequacy of fiscal resources (Annex 5). The design of SDPOs
would include cross-sectoral policy reforms, linked to the federal agenda. Given the federal
programs already initiated aimed at improving fiscal and public financial management, the
SDPOs would have a strong focus on these areas as well. At a second stage, SDPOs could be
expanded to states with minimum acceptable fiduciary standards, with a more challenging
agenda of policy reforms; a third stage could cover poorer and lower-capacity states.16
88.
Introducing SDPOs has risks. Institutional structures in most states are not strong and
further changes in the political environment could affect the sustainability of reforms. This calls
for a strong government buy-in and for starting SDPOs at the beginning of a political cycle.
Second, the quality of the state’s PFM-system will need to meet a necessary degree of
transparency and accountability. It will be important to assess the quality of PFM-systems in
each state before a SDPO can be put in place. Finally, the statistical capacity at the state level
will need to be sufficient to monitor results of the SDPO.17
89.
In the Niger Delta, the approach will be attentive to the particularly fragile
circumstances of the area. Sustainable development in the Niger Delta will be difficult in the
absence of a peace settlement acceptable to all parties. Nevertheless, the Bank, DFID, USAID
and the AfDB have worked closely to agree on a joint position on the Niger Delta. Development
partners will continue to seek opportunities to work with those state governments in the Niger
Delta that demonstrate commitment to reform and better governance. The Bank is currently
implementing CDD projects in the core states of Niger Delta (Fadama III and Community Social
Development), as is USAID (Cassava Enterprise Development, Conflict Mitigation, and
16

This approach was successfully used in India, where over the years, the focus of SDPOs shifted to poorer states
with lower capacity, yet with credible reform programs.
17
As state fiduciary systems improve, another approach with potential for sub-national lending in Nigeria is the use
of investment lending instruments to support multi-sectoral multi-year SWAps. The SWAps would support
programs with multi-year state budgets and results indicators. The first experience of this sort in Brazil in the Ceara
State brought about important advances on fiscal management, public sector management and service delivery in
key sectors, which led to the replication of the model in other states: Minas Gerais, Distrito Federal and
Pernambuco.

30

HIV/AIDS). The Bank has also had good discussions with Bayelsa State on public financial
management, education and local government, which creates a solid basis for development of a
closer relationship; the US Government is also working closely in Bayelsa State. A number of
IFC projects have direct bearing on the Niger Delta, including a program co-funded by the
Nigerian and Norwegian Governments to upgrade the capacity of local fabrication companies to
undertake complex local content provision to the oil and gas industry which is dominant in the
Niger Delta region. The Federal Government created a new ministry in September 2008, which
is expected to be responsible for implementing the 15 year, $50 billion Niger Delta Regional
Development Master Plan. Partners will work closely with the Ministry and its parastatals on
future support to the Niger Delta.

PARTNER SUPPORT

World Bank Lending and AAA

90.
The Bank portfolio currently comprises 28 IDA projects and 2 GEF projects, with a
volume that has more than doubled from US$1.5 billion in FY05 to about US$4.1 billion in
FY09. Aside from support for the government’s efforts to mitigate the effect of the global
financial crisis (next paragraph), infrastructure and human development comprise almost twothirds of the lending portfolio. The strong focus in the current portfolio is on project
implementation for results. The IFC investment portfolio totals $435 million in 29 projects; the
advisory portfolio includes 13 projects with a budget of $22.8 million.
91.
Bank support to emerging crisis. The Bank will support Nigeria with a DPO of $500
million early in FY10. The operation demonstrates the Bank’s flexibility and responsiveness to
Federal government needs. The proposed DPO is intended to provide budgetary support to the
FGN to offset the fiscal impact of the crisis and support the government in maintaining its
current economic reform path in the financial sector, fiscal policy and management, and
governance. The focus of the DPO on strengthening the banking sector and on increasing
government spending is fully aligned with the core themes of governance and increasing non-oil
growth. The adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, for example, will improve
accounting and auditing standards, at the heart of improved banking sector supervision and
governance in the financial sector (Box 7). The DPO complements other active and prospective
operations that will help to mitigate the impact of the crisis, including two large CDD operations
(Fadama III and Community Social Development Project) that are just starting, and support for
safety net enhancements (CCT program). The Bank has also added $50 million to the $100
million credit approved for the Commercial Agriculture Development Project for basic staple
crops (maize and rice) production to address rising food prices.
92.
IFC support to financial crisis. IFC is undertaking initiatives focused on the financial
sector, including an examination of the capital requirements of selected banks, and potential
equity investments by the Bank Capitalization Fund, one of the IFC global crisis response
initiatives. IFC will accelerate implementation of a number of advisory services programs,
including programs to improve corporate governance practices of Nigerian banks and to
stimulate fixed income securities market, particularly given the decline in the equities market.
Furthermore, IFC is planning the issuance of a Naira Currency bond which will amongst other

31

objectives serve as a demonstration transaction for non-equity securities. These are in addition to
Risk-Sharing Facilities which IFC plans to pilot with banks.
93.
The remainder of the World Bank program for FY10-13 responds to the strategy of
support for the three pillars (V, Section C) by intensified focus at state level and use of a broad
range of innovative approaches (CCT) and instruments (Energy project, SDPOs/SWAps). The
support exploits the Bank’s comparative advantage as: (i) an important source of financing for
states; (ii) a conveyor of development assistance through partnership with a large number of
development agencies;18 (iii) a provider of policy advice and technical expertise (support to
Nigeria’s EITI initiative to complete the validation process, disseminate the 2005 EITI report,
and complete the 2006-08 audits); (iv) integrator of knowledge and financial support (the ICP
has been instrumental in the design of the GEMS and PPP projects under this CPS); and (v) an
agent to transfer global knowledge, experience and technical expertise among countries and
adapt them to the needs of Nigeria (best practice experiences from Latin America will be applied
through a Pilot CCT for Girls Education in Northern States).
94.
The Bank’s lending program and AAA have been enhanced through support from
trust funds. As of June 2009, 37 trust funds are supporting Nigeria, of which 22 are Bank
Executed and 15 Recipient executed. The total grants amount to $99 million, of which $50
million are currently available for disbursement. Trust funds support the promotion of good
governance (including corporate governance), health issues (polio, HIV/AIDS), infrastructure
(Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance, National Energy), and rural projects
(Commercial Agriculture, Fadama II, and CDD harmonization), provided co-financing
(Economic Reform and Governance, and GEF Local Empowerment and Environmental
Management), and funded free-standing complementary activities, such as the ICP, the first subnational investment climate reviews in Sub-Saharan Africa.
95.
IDA Availability. The CPS implementation will be over FY10-13 which includes the
IDA 15 replenishment period for FY10-11 and the first two years of IDA16. For IDA 15, the
indicative resources for Nigeria were larger (at SDR 2,073.7, see Table 7) than during IDA 14
because of an improved country performance rating and the larger size of the IDA15 envelope.

As an example, during a joint partner mission convened by the Bank to launch phase II of the global Malaria
Booster Project, a detailed joint plan of action was agreed by the government and the partners to saturate the
country; agreements were reached on a new national strategic plan, an implementation plan, rationalization and
harmonization of the approaches, and tools and indicators to be used by the partners.

The indicative amounts for FY12-13 will depend on IDA 16’s available resources.
Actual allocations during the CPS period will be in accordance with the Performance Based
Allocation System which takes into account: (i) total IDA resources; (ii) Nigeria’s country
performance relative to the performance of other IDA borrowers; (iii) financing terms; and
(iv) the number of IDA eligible countries. Table 7 assumes that IDA allocations in FY12-13 will
remain the same as in FY10-11.
97.
A debt sustainability analysis conducted in 2008 by Nigeria’s Debt Management Office
found that Nigeria’s debt outlook was robust. The results were confirmed by Bank and Fund
staffs’ calculations. Despite the significant changes in oil prices since the completion of the last
DSA, in view of very low debt servicing ratios, the risk of debt default over the medium term
remains low. Under a scenario of a prolonged oil price shock (calibrated as one standard
deviation of Brent crude prices over the period 1970-2006) Nigeria’s external debt ratio could
reach 37 percent of GDP by 2027, but debt service payments would remain low at around 1
percent of exports. The bulk of current outstanding external debt is to multilateral creditors, and
government continues to reiterate its desire to contract any future borrowings on concessional
terms. The stock of domestic debt of the federal government has increased only modestly since
2005, mostly as a result of the securitization of budget and pension arrears.
98.
The indicative IDA lending program is shown in Table 8. It is based on the following
principles: (i) address all three pillars selectively and in a targeted manner; for example, under
human development focus on primary education and health in the North (State Health and State
Education) with more resources for primary health care and education, more community
participation, training of service providers in basic health care package and revitalization of
routine immunization; for both non-oil growth and human development scale up infrastructure
investments in energy and transport, continue focus on tertiary education and skills development
(ii) scale up lending in areas that have achieved results (RAMP II, Lagos Urban Transport II,
SGCBP II and III); (iii) respond to emerging government priorities; for example, a fast-track
DPO (early FY10) in response to the impact of the global crisis; (iv) adopt innovative financing
mechanisms (the FY11 Energy Project builds on the FY09 Energy sector project which includes
many “firsts” in Nigeria including catalyzing private sector finance;19 (v) support the
government’s PPP agenda, for example, the FY11 PPP project addresses binding infrastructure
constraints that limit firm productivity and employment generating growth; (vi) facilitate access
of Nigeria to Carbon Finance, Climate Investment Funds: The Bank has facilitated an initiative
in the power sector where the Transmission Company is claiming carbon credits for gas emission
reductions in its network and further support in FY12; and (vii) flexibility for determining where
intensified focus on states will be, based on state specific needs, commitment to sector reform,
and improved governance (SDOs).

19

Energy project includes many “firsts” to illustrate: (i) a PRG in support of gas supply agreements with
international oil companies to ensure adequate gas supply to sustain power generation; (ii) a first guarantee
operation to underpin gas market reforms as opposed to support for specific greenfield or privatization; (iii) reliance
on national regulations to address impacts of upstream investments by these oil companies, and existing downstream
infrastructure; and (iv) provision of technical assistance to build capacity for enforcement gaps in environmental and
social compliance. Going forward the Bank might explore the use of IBRD guarantees if appropriate.

More selectivity will be used in AAA. Over the CPS period, these will become more
strategic, based on strong government ownership (see Box 10 for example of good practice), to
inform lending, policy dialogue, and build capacity (Table 9). A Climate Assessment in FY11
would provide the analytical underpinning for a new operation to address climate change-related
risks (FY12); it would cover: (i) major sources and extent of greenhouse gas emissions;
(ii) vulnerability of Nigeria to climate variability and change; (iii) capacity of Nigeria policy, legal,
and institutional framework to address adaptation to climate change, and options for Nigeria's
economy to become more resilient to climate change; (iv) identification of opportunities for
Nigeria to reduce emission through mitigation options across sectors, and (v) identification of
potential funding to complement Bank support, including from the carbon market, Climate
Investment Fund, and the Clean Technology Fund. The Community Based Health and Nutrition
and Governance in Service Delivery will inform water, health and education projects and the
Agricultural strategy in FY10 will form the basis for Agricultural Competitiveness credit in FY11.
The Education Sector Strategy will develop a more systematic approach to education at all three
levels of government, and will examine the role of public and private sector as providers of
education. An agriculture project from FY09 is financing studies on irrigation which may lead to
financing some irrigation works under the agricultural productivity project.

Box 10: Successful Ownership and Dissemination: Financial System Strategy (FSS) 2020
In September 2006 the CBN asked the Bank to assist in developing a Financial System Strategy (FSS) 2020. Following
the successful completion of the consolidation of the banking system, the aim of FSS 2020 is to transform Nigeria into the
financial hub of Africa by becoming the safest and fastest growing financial system among emerging market countries.
Crucial to the success of FSS 2020 is that the strategy and process have been owned and managed from the outset by
the Nigerian authorities. The development of the strategy involved representatives of all the regulators, industry
participants, academics, donors, etc. The CBN set up a coordination unit supported by experienced local consultants,
and a Steering Committee comprised of the Minister of Finance, the CBN Governor and Deputy Governors, the
Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Insurance and Pensions Commissioners, as well
as key private sector representatives. From the outset ‘focus groups’ were organized for various sub-sectors.
At the request of CBN, the Bank helped to organize an international conference in June 2007, to present the vision
outlined by FSS 2020. It was opened by the recently-elected Nigerian President and included international experts in
the financial system from larger emerging economies. Following the conference, the CBN Governor's immediate
priority was to define an action plan for FSS 2020 and further diagnostic work to set the baseline for the strategy’s
implementation. Grant funding is being used to support this second phase. Diagnostic work in 2008 included capital
markets, insurance, pensions, housing finance and social housing, SME access to finance, microfinance, creditor
rights & corporate insolvency and the banking sector.
In an effort to maintain a results-oriented focus, the Bank is also assisting the CBN in putting together a Monitoring
and Evaluation framework for FSS 2020 and advising the project implementation unit in organizing the transition to
an implementation office reporting to the Steering Committee to be appointed by the President.

100. At the state level, AAA has been used as an entry point to engage in dialogue with the
governor in Bayelsa in the Niger Delta, first in the conflict zone. The Public Expenditure
Review could form the basis for further collaboration between the Bank and the Bayelsa State
government. This engagement could also potentially be expanded to Rivers state in the Niger
Delta.
101. Support for Regional Programs: In recognition of Nigeria’s potential as a regional and
continental hub and driver of growth, the Bank is supporting regional initiatives to foster
regional economic and political integration, including: (i) West Africa Gas Pipeline to secure
reliable access to cheaper and environmentally cleaner gas from Nigeria, in lieu of liquid fuel
for power generation and other industrial and commercial uses, in Ghana, Benin, and Togo; (ii)
the Abidjan-Lagos corridor scheduled for FY10, which promotes an integrated approach to
combating the spread of HIV/AIDS; (iii) collaborative efforts in West and Central Africa to
improve air transport safety and security; (iv) joint management of shared water resources for
multi-purpose utilization in the Niger River Basin and Lake Chad; and (v) the ECOWAS
Common External Tariff. There is tremendous scope for dialogue and for resources to regional
programs during the CPS period. These opportunities include involvement in the follow up to
the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable Ecosystems Management
Program, programs for regional infrastructure and posting of a Bank staff in Abuja to work on
regional issues and with ECOWAS.
102. Support for South-South Cooperation. Under the current CPS, a number of initiatives
will be explored. One example is Nigeria’s cooperation with South Korea to learn from its
highly successful Korean Technical and Vocational Systems and Tertiary Education Systems
in both public and private sectors, to link education with the labor market and to improve
student tests and institute learning achievement monitoring systems. Other opportunities for
South-South cooperation are with Chile on its advanced monitoring and evaluation system,
with Brazil and Mexico on CCT Programs (Brazil Bolsa Familia, Mexico Oportunidades) and
with India on its Viability Gap Fund to fund PPPs where there could be a number of sources of
financing but still not enough to fill the funding gap. Within Africa, Nigeria could cooperate
with countries on conditional transfer schemes that are similar to its MDG conditional grants
scheme, yet more mature and larger in scope, such as the Uganda local government
development program or Kenya's Local Authority Transfer Fund. In the private sector, the IFC
will continue to explore South-South opportunities by mining relationships with potential
investors, following its experiences with its facilitation of the entry of Indorama from
Indonesia as a core investor in Eleme Petrochemical plant.
103. More focus on improving the country portfolio performance. In late June 2009, the
disbursement rate was 18.4 percent and projects at risk were 35.7 percent. The decline in
performance since FY07 was due to: (i) a change in government at the Federal level and in
many states in 2007, bringing in administrations unfamiliar with Bank projects (in-coming
State governments removed key project staff and proposed funding ineligible activities);
(ii) government revised priorities after project approval and requested substantial changes in
project activities; (iii) a shift in the Bank portfolio towards states where project implementation
and contract management capacities were weaker than expected; (iv) unrealistic disbursement
schedules; and (v) Bank budget allocations not commensurate with the needs of working at
state level. In response to the decrease in portfolio performance, Government and the Bank

36

have carried out intensive efforts to ensure increased disbursements and improve
implementation to achieve results. Actions to increase state capacity for project
implementation include training for procurement, financial management, monitoring and
evaluation, management of contracts, and intensifying dialogue with State governments on
project procedures.20 Other actions include using smaller contracts that are faster to disburse
and implement. Government and the Country Team have also been restructuring potential
problem projects and reallocating resources. The Country Director is closely monitoring the
portfolio through pre- and post-mission briefings, and in newly approved projects, asking for a
monthly review of progress by Bank and counterpart teams to share lessons, fine tune the
approach and meet the project readiness indicators.
B.

DFID

104. The DFID portfolio currently comprises 25 programs and an annual budget of £120
million in FY09/10 rising to £140 million in FY10/11. The program fits within the current
CPS framework of governance, human development and growth. Fifteen of DFID’s programs
are focused on state level activities which cover 29 states, but the majority of DFID support is
concentrated within its focal states, the 2005 CPS lead states of Lagos, Kano, Kaduna, Enugu
and Cross River, plus Jigawa. This support is summarized in Table 10.
C.

AfDB

105. The AfDB’s current strategy is human capital development through interventions in
the social sectors and stimulating private sector-led growth in the non-oil sector, through
enhanced infrastructure, agricultural and rural development. ADF-XI21 priorities are on
infrastructure, good governance, private sector development and regional integration, which
are in line with the CPS framework. Currently, the AfDB portfolio comprises 20 public sector
projects totaling about US$591.8 million and nine private sector projects amounting to US$598
million. AfDB’s projects cover on average 20 States. Table 11 outlines the indicative lending
program.
D.

USAID

106. USAID’s strategy will emphasize the three pillars of the CPS. Improving governance
will continue to be the foundation of the program in line with the priority in the CPS. USAID
will work with civil society, the private sector, and partners to strengthen service delivery
systems and increase transparency and accountability, harnessing states’ own resources to
deliver services more effectively to citizens. Specific priorities will remain state level fiscal
policy and public procurement reform, human resources development, agriculture value chain
development and food security, trade reform, and energy and climate change investments.

20

To encourage oversight and management at the Federal level of state level Financial Management Units an IDF
grant will establish a Federal Project Financial Management Unit.
21
AFD is the African Development Fund, the soft-window of AfDB, similar to the relationship between the Bank
and IDA.

107. To support non-oil growth, USAID will make agro-processors central to the value
chain and sector development to increase rural incomes and jobs. The processors guarantee an
output market and through linkages with financial institutions can provide the money needed to
purchase inputs from private agro-enterprises. The financial institutions in turn get paid by the
agro-processors when goods are delivered by farmers for processing. This model enables USAID
to strengthen the agricultural private sector. Regional and international trade in agriculture based
commodities will be the main companion objective of the focus on agriculture value chain. The
priority subsectors will be to improve the capacity in trade policy, strengthen the transportation
sector and reduce time and costs of trade, in addition to facilitation of customs modernization.
108. To improve health indicators, USAID will follow a systems strengthening approach in
key northern states, integrating the public health services, basic education services and
democracy and governance programs. USAID’s public health services program will improve
management, quality and utilization of maternal and child health, family planning and
reproductive health and malaria services in all LGAs of two states in the north. USAID’s new
health strategy emphasizes greater geographical focus, and strategic integration of key program
areas and resources.
109. In the education sector, USAID will assist the northern states to strengthen the quality
of education management. This includes: the development of Education Management
Information Systems (EMIS); building the capacity of state, local government and communities
to implement and use the EMIS; and the capacity of the States to manage, allocate, disburse and
track their education funds while meeting good governance benchmarks. Second, USAID will
strengthen the development and implementation of policies such as the new Early Childhood
Development Policy. Third, it will focus on the education civil service and teacher
recruitment/training policy, and gender/girls education policy. USAID is playing a leadership
role to reform existing policies on teacher training, teacher qualifications and national schoolbased data collection in support of the National Teacher Education Policy which took effect in
January 2009. USAID will support up to five pre service teacher training colleges.
39

110. In HIV/AIDS, USAID, as part of the U.S. Government interagency team for the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), will assist in strengthening the
Government of Nigeria’s ability to assume ownership of the HIV/AIDS response and support
HIV prevention, counseling and testing, care and treatment services in all 36 states of Nigeria
and the FCT. Despite the rapid expansion of HIV services across the country, coverage of
essential prevention and treatment interventions remains low, and unmet demand is enormous.
The response must be multisectoral and integrated, reducing duplication and building on
synergies. Health systems, particularly at the primary level, are weak and require strengthening
to expand access to critical services. The U.S. Government will work with the Government to
develop a PEPFAR Country Partnership Framework Agreement that engages the public sector,
civil society, inter-faith bodiesand the private sector to address the issues of HIV/AIDS and to
advance Nigeria’s ownership of the fight against HIV/AIDS. The PEPFAR Nigeria Framework
Agreement will seek to achieve the following objectives: a) intensify prevention efforts; b)
integrate HIV/AIDS response into the health care system; c) strengthen health care system at all
levels; and d) expand access to quality services in care and treatment. The Country Partnership
Framework Agreements is expected to focus on three key areas: financing; policy reform; and
measurable results. Such an Agreement would promote deeper integration of HIV/AIDS
prevention, care, and treatment into broader health care and public health networks in both the
private and government sectors.
111. In the specific area of governance, USAID assistance will continue to support CSOs,
election assistance, and the media. For CSOs, USAID will focus on building their capacity to
advocate for policy reform, strengthen CSO-Government partnerships to fight corruption,
develop strategies for expanding CSO membership and their alliances with professional
associations, media, and membership-based local associations. On election assistance, USAID
will work on a two-track approach: one track will strengthen civil society and public oversight of
the 2011 elections, and a second track will pursue longer-term reforms. For media, the goal is an
effective media that will enable citizens to participate in the democratic process that comes from
increased knowledge on issues that lead to greater transparency and accountability and better
service delivery.
E.

Results Monitoring and Management

112. The results matrix of this CPS has drawn upon the priorities in this document and has
been developed in close partnership with government. However, in the absence of a national
M&E framework which is under development, the CPS outcomes could not be tightly linked to
government’s indicators with baselines and targets. The CPS Progress Report will re-examine
the alignment of the CPS matrix with the government’s M&E system as it is developed. The
results during the current CPS period will be largely achieved with the program already under
implementation. Table 12 shows the selected CPS results from the results matrix to which the
program of support during FY10-13 will contribute.
113. The partnership has launched a number of initiatives. First, the partnership will focus
efforts on improving statistical capacity and monitoring in a number of areas. Efforts will
continue to strengthen Nigeria’s statistical capacity, which is key to ensuring availability of
current data for policy making and monitoring. Following the adoption of the Statistical Master
Plan for 2005-2009 in 2004, NBS was created, a new Statistics Act was enacted in 2007, giving

40

autonomy to the NBS and in March 2009 the Board of the NBS was constituted. The World
Bank and DFID supported capacity development in NBS to improve the quality of the statistical
base and the timeliness of information paving the way for bringing Nigeria into full compliance
with the General Data Dissemination System requirements. NBS has also now produced new
indicators of social statistics in a major publication, the “Social Statistics in Nigeria”. Going
forward, more focus is needed in promoting coordination between the NBS zonal offices, state
and Federal statistical systems as well as supporting statistics at the state level. A second priority
will be support for the implementation of the National Statistics Development Strategy (NSDS),
currently being developed with funding from the African Development Bank, as well as support
to the National Population Commission to improve vital statistics. The World Bank has posted a
statistician in the country office to oversee statistical capacity building and partners will work
together to identify support for NSDS and vital statistics after the agencies present their plans
and funding requests. In the current CPS, DFID and the World Bank will help Nigeria access the
new Scaling up for Results Facility. Potential areas for partner support in line with focus on the
state level could include:
•
•
•
•
•

Costed, realistic state statistical strategies in at least 5 states;
Establishing mechanisms for coordination of statistical activities between the NBS,
zonal offices, the States and the MDAs;
Developing a statistical template for the production of annual state statistical year
books in selected states;
Regular consultation with the state governments on statistical issues and concerns;
Preparing states for passage of statistics act and its implementation.

114. Second, we will use the CPS results matrix during implementation to monitor CPS
results. Under the previous strategy, outcome champions from DFID and World Bank had been
nominated to report progress on results to the heads of the two agencies in joint management team
meetings (JMT). While agency heads met regularly, there was insufficient discussion of results.
For this CPS the partners have agreed to the following: (i) identifying pillar heads for each of the
three pillars rather than outcome champions so that accountability and focus is on CPS pillars; and
(ii) JMT hearing from pillars in rotation—each one quarterly on key issues on progress including
specific achievements (for communications purposes as well as monitoring), major issues and risks
and actions needed from JMT. To monitor World Bank contributions to CPS results, a Country
Program Results Monitoring tool has been piloted and is about to be launched. Nigeria will be the
second country within the World Bank’s Africa Region to use the tool to systematically capture
and consolidate information on country results. So far, it has been presented to the World Bank’s
country team and also to some key government officials. The key features of this tool include the
ability to monitor the CPS outcomes and milestones and to produce useful management reports. It
provides the capability to drill down to the active portfolio (and pipeline) and pick up indicators
(including external sources) and project information. M&E arrangements and responsibilities at
different levels, including with partners and the government, will be defined for data sources,
collection and reporting. In addition, the CPS includes important efforts in capacity strengthening
and building of in-country monitoring and evaluation capacity at the Federal and States levels. For
example National M&E capacity will be strengthened at the Federal level under the ERGP and at
the State level (for selected States) under SGCBP.

115. Third, through participation in the Africa Impact Evaluation Initiative Nigeria has
been increasing its capacity to carry out impact evaluation on selected investments and to use
the results for policy decisions. To date, one impact evaluation has been completed (Fadama II)
and two are on-going (FY09 Malaria Control Booster Project and the slum upgrading component
of FY06 Lagos Metropolitan Development Project). Another four are in the design phase: FY09
Lagos Eko Secondary Education School Project, FY09 Commercial Agricultural Development
Project, FY10 education conditional cash transfer for girls’ education and FY10 Fadama III).
Under the current CPS, Bank support will focus on capacity development for evidence-based
policy making and technical assistance. Activities will include a country-based impact evaluation
workshop with ministries.

Budget Implications of Strategy and Approach

116. Increased engagement at the state level calls for more resources. Increased lending
support at state level in general, and the Northern states in particular, with no prior working
experience with Bank projects will require more resources. More resources will also be needed
43

for capacity building, working with beneficiaries, other stakeholders and civil society
participants, and developing strong monitoring and evaluation systems, to provide reliable
information on project performance and development impact. All of these will take longer, with
higher lending preparation cost than in the past. To allow for higher quality project supervision
in the Nigerian context and to address the weaknesses that had emerged in the portfolio’s
performance, the Country Management Unit has started to allocate more resources to the project
supervision; the need for higher supervision resources will intensify as the stronger lending
support is provided at state level, particularly in case of weaker state
VII.

RISKS

117. Nigeria presents substantial opportunities, but these opportunities are not without
risks. The current CPS identifies six principal risks as articulated below.
118. The risk to Nigeria of continuing impact of the global financial crisis. Forging a four
year assistance strategy in Nigeria at this juncture is fraught with uncertainties: how deep and
how long the global financial crisis will last and what the full impact will be on the Nigerian
economy and society. The federal government is mitigating this risk by continuing to exercise
caution in using the ECA, maintaining efforts to strengthen the fiscal balance and reprioritizing
government spending. In response to the crisis, the 2009 budget caps recurrent expenditure, and
makes an effort to target major growth and poverty alleviation bottlenecks through higher
allocations for capital spending in priority sectors (roads, agriculture/water, and power). In
addition 6 percent of the capital budget is distributed as grants through the MDG office. It is also
working on faster execution of works, power projects, and investment in priority sectors or
distribution of grants which will have a direct employment effect, and will address longer-term
supply bottlenecks
119. The risk of policy reversals or governance reform slowdown must be taken into
account. The strong technocratic team in 2004 was instrumental in introducing far reaching
changes in Nigeria’s planning, budgeting and financial management system, and for taking
aggressive steps to deal with corruption. In spite of a good track record on reforms over the past
five years, progress has not been continuous or smooth. As one example, reforms in fiscal
federalism to ensure that sound fiscal management becomes a responsibility of all levels of
government has not been translated into solid public financial management at the state level. In
addition, as mentioned earlier, the recent pressures on the exchange rate and rising interest rates
have prompted the central bank to reintroduce foreign exchange control measures, a policy
response that may create distortions and has reduced confidence in economic management.
Especially under the current economic climate, pressures within Nigeria may be strong to
increase protection on selected industries that are suffering from the global downturn, limit
market mechanisms for foreign exchange, for example, and resist further tariff increases on
electricity. Factors that may mitigate this risk include the growing importance of an emerging
middle class that has benefited from economic growth resulting from reforms; and the relatively
good relationship and close policy dialogue established with the Bank. But the presence of strong
champions within the government will remain critical to a steady pace of progress in reforms.
120. At the State level, the risk of lack of commitment and weak governance systems. States
will need to improve the quality of budget management, public finance management and

44

procurement. To mitigate the risk of lack of commitment and corruption, the partners will use
governance capability and commitment criteria to ensure close partnership with states that have
demonstrated strong reform commitment through implementation on the ground in improving
procurement and public financial management. Partners will also strengthen citizens’ capacity to
demand transparency and accountability. The MOU between state governments and CPS
partners will ensure greater clarity about the expectations on both sides, and provide a
mechanism to monitor (and where necessary challenge) the level of commitment. In addition, the
partnership will allocate more budget for project preparation and supervision but this will not
fully eliminate the potential for corruption, necessitating adjustments as specific issues arise.
121. Risks related to institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints in states. These
weaknesses are likely to be more serious in the Northern states. An increase in the share of
resources going to these states is likely to raise the overall risk profile while offering the
potential for higher rewards in terms of progress in human development indicators. This increase
in risk may be somewhat counterbalanced by investments in low-risk sectors or repeater
financing for tested approaches.
122. Political risks and absence of strong reform champions could also affect CPS
implementation. If the presidential and legislative elections in 2011 are accompanied by a long
electoral campaign during which government will focus on politics at the expense of its reform
program, or by violence and social unrest, implementation of CPS support could be slowed down
or jeopardized. Flawed elections in 2011 would undermine accountability at the highest level,
and could further weaken accountability at all levels. Another risk is absence of strong reform
champions. The positive impact during 2003-2007 was to a large extent due to a strong
technocratic reform team that introduced far-reaching changes in Nigeria’s planning, budgeting
and financial management system, and took steps to deal with corruption. If strong reform
champions don’t emerge at the highest levels, the implementation of the current CPS pillars will
be adversely affected. These risks can be mitigated by ensuring broad support for and ownership
of programs both at Federal and state levels and working with partners to strengthen government
institutions so that success becomes less dependent on individuals.
123. Risk of deterioration in the security and law and order situation, which could shift
government’s focus from economic matters. So far conflicts in the Niger Delta, Plateau state
and elsewhere have been confined in their respective areas. However, this risk cannot be directly
mitigated. The operation would rely on the government’s commitment to improved security, as
confirmed by the renewed efforts to end militancy in the Delta. Improved security is one of the
points of the President’s seven-point agenda. The government has also shown its commitment in
this area by the recent creation of a ministry for the Niger Delta.

ANNEX 2: FY05-09 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT (CPSCR)
Country: Nigeria
Date of Progress Report: April 2008
Period Covered by the CPS-CR: FY2005-2009
I. Introduction
1.
This Completion Report assesses the effectiveness of the Nigeria Country Partnership
Strategy for FY05-09 (the 2005 CPS) in achieving the expected results and underlines the lessons
learned. The 2005 CPS was presented to the Board in June 2005, shortly after Nigeria launched
its strategy of growth and poverty reduction, namely the NEEDS. Nigeria made good progress in
implementing key reforms, particularly in macroeconomic management and the fight against
corruption, but progress towards the MDGs was slower than hoped. The international context—
including factors such as falling oil prices, after they reached a record high in July 2008,
combined with instability in global financial markets and the likelihood of global recession—
could pose risks to the continuation of Nigeria’s good economic performance. On the other hand,
with the recent introduction of more sound fiscal policies, it is predicted that Nigeria will be able
to manage any potential crises reasonably well. Section II summarizes the challenges faced in
implementing the 2005 CPS.
2.
The 2005 CPS program priorities were fully aligned with Nigeria’s own priorities and
development objectives. The latter consisted of: (i) improved service delivery for human
development; (ii) improved environment and services for non-oil growth; and (iii) enhanced
transparency and accountability for better governance. Progress achieved against these long-term
strategic goals and the 2005 CPS outcomes is discussed in Section III.
3.
The 2005 CPS proposed specific activities to support the Federal Government and
selected well-performing states (lead states). In the context of the successful national elections,
the 2005 CPS was designed as a “joint WB–DFID approach to assist Nigeria to implement its
program to boost growth and achieve the MDGs.” Due to the huge development needs in the
country, a partnership between the WB and DFID also provided the opportunity to achieve
greater impact and was based upon comparative strengths. Overall, the 2005 CPS proposed
additional financial and technical assistance to signal strong support for the government’s reform
efforts and to help finance the necessary investment to remove obstacles to growth and
development. The proposed strategy was based on four principles: (i) realism about opportunities
and scope for change; (ii) responsiveness and government ownership; (iii) selectivity for impact;
and (iv) balancing a longer-term transformational agenda with the need for more direct, shorterterm impacts. Other MDG-related activities were also supported elsewhere in the country.
Section IV discusses the effectiveness of the 2005 CPS principles and strategic approaches, and
Section V the lessons learned and recommendations going forward (including implementation of
the lead state approach.)
4.
The main conclusion of the Completion Report is that the WB was particularly successful
through: (i) the delivery of significant “quick wins” (e.g., the debt relief agreement, the

57

successful retrieval of Abacha-stolen funds and a substantial increase in the IDA envelope); and
(ii) in deepening the partnership with federal and state governments to support reform efforts.
The latter included efforts to support the federal government in: (i) strengthening fiscal
management and fighting corruption (e.g., the oil-price fiscal rule, procurement reform, Nigeria
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; and (ii) assisting in the implementation of the
privatization program, including port concession; (iii) contributing to the development of the
financial sector strategy and strengthening access to finance through the provision of timely
technical assistance. The WB program in human development (water, health and education) and
in governance generated modest results.
5.
This Completion Report is based on the contributions from the WB country team and
DFID partners, a review of government documents, and WB assessments including the 2008
CPS Progress Report. The country team also benefited from a detailed evaluation of the Bank’s
performance, over the period of 1998-2007, that was prepared by the Independent Evaluation
Group and reflected in the Country Assistance Evaluation. The evaluation found that, during this
period, the Bank provided important assistance to the Government of Nigeria and which also
strengthened the Bank’s reputation and credibility considerably. In spite of the relatively small
size of the Bank’s financial contribution, (particularly given Nigeria’s earnings from oil
revenues), the Bank’s objective advice was considered valuable and positively influenced
perceptions about Nigeria in the international community. During the period to mid-2003,
however, the Bank had some difficulty in clarifying its role. A large number of lending
operations were started, often with an insufficient base of local knowledge needed for successful
projects. At the same time the Bank was slow to invest in analytic work. These issues were
recognized and after 2004 the Bank adapted its program to provide more effect support. The
Bank is now well placed to continue to make an important contribution to Nigeria’s economic
and social progress as the Nigerian Government continues its commitment to reform.
II. Nigeria’s Challenges and Partnership Response
6.
In 2005, Nigeria faced significant challenges in achieving and sustaining macroeconomic
stability, accelerating growth, reducing poverty and meeting the MDGs. Some of these
challenges included: (i) macroeconomic volatility, dependence on oil; (ii) near collapse of social
and economic infrastructure; (iii) poor governance; (iv) high poverty and large regional
disparities in social indicators, (v) unfavorable business environment; and (vi) personal safety
and security issues. NEEDS—a medium-term plan for economic recovery, growth and
development -- was launched by the country in 2004 as a response to these numerous challenges
facing the nation.
7.
These challenges were also recognized by the WB and DFID in the formulation of the
2005 CPS. Its three pillars strongly correlated with NEEDS’ principal strategic priorities,
namely, (i) improved service delivery for human development, (ii) improved environment and
services for non-oil growth, and (iii) enhanced transparency and accountability for better
governance. Governance was considered particularly important in order to assist the government
to strengthen economic and fiscal management at the federal and state level, as well as to
improve Nigeria’s reputation on the international stage and to attract more foreign direct
investment.

58

8.
Even with the high oil prices, the 2005 CPS recognized that Nigeria faced a significant
shortfall in meeting its development financing needs. For example, in 2004-05, the country faced
limited donor involvement and negative net transfers of US$1.3 billion per annum due to the
servicing of its high debt obligations. This situation was exacerbated by the following factors: (i)
no access to IBRD lending; (ii) a low CPIA rating which did not recognize any of the country’s
reform efforts and translated into extremely low IDA allocations; and (iii) weak implementation
of the Bank’s portfolio, especially at the state level, which further contributed to the low country
ratings.
9.
The development partners also identified a relatively weak knowledge base in Nigeria. In
response, the 2005 CPS envisaged the strengthening of analytical and advisory assistance in
informing project design and helping the government to make significant policy achievements.
Analytical work was aimed at identifying and prioritizing constraints to growth, underpinning
poverty dialogue with the collection of more robust poverty data and defining options for
efficient use of public resources through public expenditure management and financial
assessments.
10.
Partners chose a Lead state approach to concentrate and leverage resources at the state
level and in order to increase impact, strengthen demand and commitment for reforms. The
rationale was that: (i) the Bank’s limited resources could not have significant impact if spread
thinly over the country with 36 states and 140 million people; (ii) aid effectiveness could be
achieved through concentration of resources in selected states with greater potential for success;
and (iii) success in a few states could be replicated and scaled up through leveraging of Nigeria’s
own public resources.
11.
In 2007, the President expressed commitment to continuing the reform process
pronounced in NEEDS and started under the previous administration. As reflected in the CPS
Progress Report, the WB and DFID adjusted its program to reflect increased emphasis on the
power sector, state governance and dialogue with partners on Niger Delta issues.
III. Progress against Long-Term Strategic Goals and CPS1 Outcomes
Progress towards long-term strategic goals
12.
Macro-economic performance during the period of 2005 CPS program implementation
has been impressive. Growth averaged 6 percent annually between 2004, 2005 and 2007 and is
projected to rise to 9 percent in 2008, reflecting a broad range of sectors. The non-oil sector,
providing a livelihood for the majority of Nigerians and driven by the agriculture,
manufacturing, minerals and telecommunication sectors, has grown at more than 8 percent per
annum accelerating to more than 9 percent in 2007-08. Improved fiscal management has been
responsible for most of the recent macroeconomic improvements. Inflation declined to single
digits in 2006-07, but increased to some 15 percent in 2008 due to the rise in food prices and
sharp increase in private sector credit.
13.
The most fundamental reforms were in fiscal management at the federal level. An oil
price based fiscal rule was successfully implemented in the 2004-2007 budgets. This innovative
measure resulted in sizeable budget surpluses and a rapid accumulation of foreign currency

59

reserves. In late 2008 when the oil prices dropped from the record high of $147 per barrel in July
2008 to $40 per barrel, the Federal Government was able to immediately revise its budget
projections for 2009 to accommodate the new reality and settled on $45 per barrel.
14.
The government used part of its oil savings to conclude the debt relief agreement with the
Paris Club through a combination of arrears clearance, debt write-offs and re-purchasing the
rest of the debt at a discounted rate. The final payment was made in April 2006, thereby
terminating a history of heavy debt obligations and difficult relations with creditors. The country
obtained its first sovereign rating at BB- both from Fitch Ratings and from Standard and Poor.
All of the $750 million fiscal space created, through the completion of the debt deal with Paris
Club Creditors, was re-allocated by the Federal Government towards MDG related expenditures
and towards reducing poverty through the Virtual Poverty Fund. In addition, classifications
within the federal budget were amended to allow better monitoring and tracking of these items.
15.
Sound fiscal policies will help Nigeria manage the macroeconomic implications of the
global financial crisis reasonably well. The financial crisis has led to a substantial revision of
Nigeria’s non-oil growth forecasts from 7-8 percent to about 4-5 percent for the period 2009-11.
However, appropriate fiscal policies, in particular expenditure restraint and the use of the ECA,
are expected to mitigate the impact of the decline in oil revenue on the economy. The ECA
amounted to $21.7 billion at the end of 2008, of which $5.3 billion were committed for a power
project. At present, there are no signs of any weakening government resolve in this area.
Nevertheless, the WB will continue to closely monitor the situation, especially in the banking
sector, and is prepared to respond rapidly to any changes in the outlook.
16.
Social indicators remain weak. A recent review of household survey data suggests that
real incomes increased significantly both in the formal and informal sectors but Nigeria’s social
indicators remain weak. Infant and under-5 child mortality rates are likely to improve as a result
of the increase in routine and polio immunization (which almost doubled between 2005 and
2006) and will be confirmed once the results of the new USAID’s Demographic and Health
Survey have been compiled. This new survey will also highlight if any progress has been made
in reducing the maternal mortality rates in the North East. These rates were catastrophically high
in the 2003 survey. In education there has been a rapid increase in enrollment rates although
concerns remain about quality and learning outcomes. Access to improved water source has
remained unchanged at 48 percent.
Progress towards CPS Outcomes by Three Pillars
17.
As described in the 2005 CPS Outcome Matrix, Annex 1of the CPSCR shows the detailed
achievements against stated objectives as measured by performance indicators. Table 2.1 of the
CPSCR summarizes some of these key achievements against each of the three pillars of the 2005
CPS.

Pillar 1: Improved service delivery for human development
18.
The goal for the 2005 CPS is “sustainable improvements in access and quality of basic
services in health, HIV/AIDS, education, water and sanitation.”
19.
The instruments used included: The CDD approach and selected MDG focused
interventions at state level; Safety Nets—including demand side support to extreme poor; and
expansion of donor base—including joint and complementary implementation arrangements.
Specific interventions included: Health Sector Development Project, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Polio,
Community-based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP), LEEMP, Community Social Development
Project, State Education Support Project, and Science and Technology Education Post Basic
Project. Technical assistance is in CCT, Poverty Assessment, PER in Education, and
Participatory M&E . Other interventions especially from other partners are as stated in Annex 1.

Education system strengthened in selected states.—Inspectorate and Assessment
system established.
Strengthened delivery of the Malaria Plus Interventions in the target states but health
systems weak and use of bed nets, although much improved, is still low.
Dramatic reduction in number of new polio cases in 2007 but with a reversal of a
positive trend in 2008.
Strengthened provision of primary health care services through renovation of health
facilities in hard-to-reach areas, procurement of medical equipment and drugs for the
facilities, establishment of cold-chains for vaccines, and training of various cadres of
health workers and their deployment to these facilities.
Revitalizing of health institutions responsible for the training of midwives, nurses
and community health workers through a reactivation of their accreditation.
A decrease in HIVAIDS prevalence from 5.8% in 2001 to 5.0% in 2003 to 4.4% in
2005 with 92% of sex workers reporting condom use with most recent clients.
Strengthened coordination, partnership and harmonization on HIV/AIDS National
Response.
Increase in school enrolment and attendance in targeted rural communities
Decrease in reported illness, reduction in time and cost of fetching water and
improved access to rural markets but access to water unchanged.
More than 75% of the resources disbursed under the CDD-based project (about
$70m) are managed at the community level.
Both the infant mortality rate and the under-five mortality rate remain high, and have
large variation across regions.
Improvement in water delivered in urban cities of Kaduna and Abeokuta, changing
the way the water utilities perform and improvement towards good management.

21.
New policies were adopted in health and education with good outcomes but challenges
remain. In the education sector for example, the universal basic education policy was adopted by all
states during 2002-2005, following adoption of the policy by the Federal Government in 1999. In
May 2008, the Senate passed the National Health Bill into law. The National Health Bill provided for

62

the establishment of a Primary Health Care Development Fund, which, among other things, will
allow for the provision of basic health care facilities through the National Health Insurance Scheme.
The Government has also taken measures to improve routine immunization, eradicate polio, lower
the incidence of malaria, and combat HIV/AIDS. For example, an ambitious nation-wide program of
universal coverage with Long-Lasting Insecticide Treated Bed-Nets has been launched with the
intention of covering every household with at least 2 nets by the end of 2010. The initial net
distribution has already produced results in terms of increased ownership and usage, (although the
exact figures will only be available after a survey to be undertaken in the latter half of 2009). Also, in
2007, the lowest polio and Type 1 polio incidence rates were recorded since 2002. Nevertheless,
Nigeria contributes the highest number of polio cases in the world and resistance to immunization
remains high in some parts of the country. Unfortunately in 2008 the incidence of polio increased
dramatically over the previous year. 1 The recent response of the Federal Government, led by the
Ministry of Health and the new leadership at the National Primary Health Care Development
Agency, has been promising and initial steps are in the right direction. More, however, will have to
be done—particularly at state and local levels—in order to overcome the barriers to polio
immunizations and to ensure that the goal of interrupting the spread of the wild polio virus is
achieved in the near future. Strong, positive trends have been reported with respect to HIV/AIDS.
Prevalence of the disease declined in women between the ages of 14 and 49 from 5.8 percent in 2001
to 4.4 percent in 2005 (National HIV/Syphilis Sero-Prevalence—Sentinel Survey 2005) and a further
decline is expected in 2008. In addition, 92 percent of sex workers are reporting condom use with
recent clients (IBBSS, FMOH, 2007).
22.
The Bank has used CDD to improve human development. More than $250m was
committed by the World Bank (and about $100m by AfDB) to 3 projects that used this approach
in 29 States across the country. Over 75% of these resources were disbursed and controlled by
the beneficiaries themselves at the community level. The CPRP and the LEEMP were focused
heavily on human capital development. Other examples of states with good success from the
CDD approach include Kebbi, Katsina, Bauchi, Niger, Yobe, Bayelsa, Cross River, and Ekiti.
(see Box 2.1).
23.
The Bank’s convenor role in both Malaria and HIV/AIDs was highly significant in
establishing a broad platform for coordinating development assistance and implementing sector
strategies. The second phase of the malaria booster program launched in Abuja, Nigeria in
December 2008 and the recent bed-net distribution program being supported by all the
development partners will help Nigeria to expand malaria prevention, care and treatment
programs, and to sharply reduce the incidence of malaria related deaths. Because of the Bank’s
role, agreements were reached on a new national strategic and implementation plan, as well as an
agreement on the rationalization and harmonization of the approaches, tools and indicators being
used by the different partners. In HIV/AIDS, for example, the National Agency for the Control
of AIDS and the development partners in Nigeria are working to develop a Joint Financing
Arrangement and a pooled fund to operate through a separate account in support of one common
work program.
1

As of December 2008, 797 polio cases had been recorded in 26 states, which represented close to a tripling of the
number of cases for the same period of time one year earlier. Kano State in the North West Zone continues to lead
the country with 272 cases (compared to 60 cases in 2007), followed by Zamfara State, also in the North West Zone,
with 85 cases (compared with five cases in 2007).

63

In human development, progress towards outcomes was moderately satisfactory
Box 2.1: Human Development Service Delivery using the CDD Approach
These projects have contributed to reduced maternal and child mortality through the construction and equipment of
primary health centers in about 400 communities; improved educational outcomes through construction and
equipment of primary and secondary school classrooms in over 800 communities; improved access to safe drinking
water through construction and operation of boreholes and motorized water pumps in over 1000 communities across
the country. There are other outputs and resulting outcomes in terms of rural/feeder roads, rural electrification, rural
markets, and natural resource management. These CDD projects also ensure beneficiary participation, empowered
poor communities and provide a reorientation of governance by sensitizing the lowest tier of government to the
needs and priorities of the governed. They have also ensured transparency and accountability while guaranteeing
capacity building at all levels. More specifically, the projects have been able to harness the abundant social capital
(social structures networks and resources) in their respective areas of operations. Participation of communities has
ensured maintenance, utilization and sustainability of the projects. This, in essence, is expected to lead to improved
output, outcome and impact. The executed micro-projects have been shown to be cost effective when compared with
the publicly executed equivalent. counterparts.

24.
In the area of urban water supply, in the six States (Lagos, Kaduna, Ogun, Cross Rivers,
Enugu and FCT) supported by the Bank, there has been improvement towards cost recovery, coverage
of service to entire cities through increase in production, development of State water policies and water
laws which is now being rectified by the various State Assemblies. The private sector is also helping in
improvement of services in Kaduna and the Commercial/Revenue units of Enugu Water.
Pillar 2: Improving environment and services for non-oil growth
25.

The goal for the 2005 CPS is “improved environment and services for non-oil growth”.

26.
This pillar was supported by: extensive TA for the financial sector and for the EITI
initiative; projects in energy (Transmission Development, Energy Development), water (Urban
Water I and II), agriculture (Fadama II and III), private sector development (Privatization
Support and MSME Project), roads (Rural Access), urban transport (Lagos Urban Transport),
extractive industries (Mineral Resources Management); and AAA, notably the energy policy
notes and investment climate assessments.
27.
During 2005-2008, the non-oil economy is estimated to have grown by about 9 percent, a
further acceleration relative to the period 2001-04, when growth averaged 7.5 percent. Growth
continued to be broad-based, and driven by the strong performance of the agricultural,
manufacturing, solid minerals, and telecommunications sectors supported by the Bank. Agriculture
grew on average by about 7 percent, in line with the 2005 CPS target; the Bank’s Fadama projects
made strong contributions. Growth performance benefited from the wide range of macroeconomic
and structural reforms implemented by the government in recent years informed by Bank’s AAA and
policy notes. Overall, the adoption of sound macroeconomic policies has created an enabling
environment for the private sector and has significantly contributed to the acceleration of non-oil
growth. The Bank’s MMSE project successfully introduced the concept of for-profit microfinance
institutions and helped reach more than 100,000 savers and borrowers around the country.
28.
A number of reforms have helped create a business environment more conducive to private
investment and the basis for more sustained growth of the private sector: (i) in the financial sector, the

64

government consolidated the banking sector, mainly by raising the minimum capital requirement from
$15 million to $190 million. To meet the new capital requirements, many of the 89 commercial banks
merged with larger and financially more robust banks, resulting in the emergence of only 24
commercial banks. The banking consolidation helped deepen financial sector intermediation (velocity
declined from 3.2 in 2004 to 2.8 in 2007) and credit to the private sector increased rapidly; (ii) the
government made substantial progress with privatization (including concessions) of major companies
in steel, petrochemicals, mining and ports. The concessioning of ports significantly improved services.
In telecommunications, legal and regulatory reforms were put in place that catalyzed strong growth;
(iii) registration and business licensing reforms have facilitated business registration. In a recent survey
in two states 40 percent of firms cited improvement in the last 5 years in the duration and the average
cost of business registration. Further improvements are expected from decentralization of the Corporate
Affairs Commission, expanding its network to over a dozen states. In addition, a one-stop investment
center has been set up at the Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission, which brings together over a
dozen ministries, departments and agencies involved in the institutional, administrative and regulatory
aspects of doing business in Nigeria; and (iv) in an effort to begin liberalization of the trade regime,
Nigeria partially adopted the Common External Tariff of ECOWAS and lowered the average tariff
from about 29 percent to 12 percent. The trade regime was further liberalized in 2008, when tariffs on a
number of import goods were lowered and several import bans were abolished.
29.
Joint work of the Bank and DFID under the ICP in 11 states, including lead states,
proved to be an efficient and effective way for knowledge expansion and to underpin the
preparation of a new project. The partnership now plans to roll the ICP out in other states.
30.
Positive results were achieved with CDD-type operations in rural areas which were
successful both in enhancing agricultural productivity and improving access to markets.
31.
Strong progress was achieved in improving the institutional environment in the energy
sector (Box 2.2), (although due to issues relating to ongoing gas availability and quality, installed
power generation capacity has not translated into available capacity and the targets for system
losses were not fully met). Bank supported reforms included Electric Power Sector Reform
Box 2.2: Significant Milestones in the Power Sector Program include:
•

A Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO) that provides for a path to cost reflective electricity retail tariffs,
transitional subsidies from government, and periodic tariff reviews. government has made a budget
allocation of $650 million in 2008-09 to implement the tariff order.
• About 1500 MW of public generation capacity has been added between 2005- 2007.
• A new process of reviewing Power Purchase Agreements, for improved transparency, has been developed
with Bank support.
• The Electric Commission has issued licenses to successor entities and new generating plants, and has
developed regulatory and network standards. Upgrades in commercial processes, and adoption of
international best practice at the utilities (through the CRESTa/ program), have led to a substantial increase
of monthly revenues from 2.8 billion Naira in 2003 to 7.75 billion Naira in 2007, and a rise in metered
customers from 40 to 67 percent.
• System losses are showing a declining trend from a historical average of 45% to about 34%. Introduction of
private management outsourcing through Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) contracts also contributed to
improvements in commercial performance of the distribution sector.
• Nigeria is the first country to claim carbon credits for SF6 gas reductions in the transmission sector, which
will be used to finance further reductions in transmission and distribution losses.
_______________

Commercial Reorientation of the Electricity Sector Toolkit.

65

legislation, enacted in March 2005, which provided for commercial operation of the sector and led
to the restructuring of the existing power utility, National Electric Power Authority into separate
generation, transmission and distribution companies. An independent regulatory agency, the
Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission was established to promote efficient and equitable
growth of the power sector as well as a Rural Electrification Agency to promote rural access.
32.
To improve the power situation in the country, a number of key measures remain to be
undertaken: (i) ensure sustained and reliable gas supply for power generation; (ii) rehabilitate
existing power plants which have been performing at low efficiency and promote PPPs to increase
power generation; (iii) ease transmission and distribution bottlenecks to move the incremental power;
(iv) enhance utility performance to safeguard the sector’s financial health and improve customer
service; and (v) strengthen corporate governance through a combination of institutional and structural
reforms. These measures form the basis of the Bank’s new energy project preparation.
33.
The quality of transport services improved significantly in Lagos state, a mega city state.
As a result of the Lagos Urban Transport Project, transport sector management was strengthened
and transportation costs decreased by 30 percent along the project corridors. Concession
agreements at 25 port terminals of Lagos ports have reduced import clearance times. By contrast,
institutional strengthening in the transport sector at the Federal level has been lagging and is
being addressed through a Federal Roads Project that has recently been declared effective. The
enactment of the Civil Aviation Authority Act ensured more autonomy for the aviation regulator
thereby setting the pace for improved safety and security in the aviation sector.
Overall progress towards outcomes in non-oil growth pillar was satisfactory.
Pillar 3: Enhanced Transparency and Accountability for Better Governance/Changing the
Way Government Works
34.
The pillar was supported by projects mentioned in the earlier pillars because they
included elements to promote good governance, as well as ERGP, Economic Management and
Capacity project (EMCAP) and SGCDP, grants and nonlending TA.
35.
Significant progress was achieved in strengthening the legal and institutional frameworks for
transparency and accountability at federal level. Three key bills were passed and signed into laws at
the federal level in 2007: (a) Procurement; (b) NEITI and (c) Fiscal Responsibility. These laws have
provided the enabling environment for transparency and accountability in the conduct of government
business and for embedding governance reforms in law. The Bank support under ERGP and
Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources, as well as grants for Procurement and NEITI, were
instrumental in the progress made so far. However, despite the progress in strengthening legal and
institutional framework for governance, some key bills are yet to be passed into laws by the National
Assembly. These include the Audit Bill and the Financial Reporting Council Bill, both of which are
key pre-conditions for operations of the Office of the Auditor General and the Nigerian Accounting
Standards Board, respectively. The World Bank public expenditure management reviews 2000 and
2006 Country Procurement Assessment Review informed the development of fiscal responsibility
and procurement legislation, and the establishment of the Bureau for Public Procurement at the
federal level.

66

36.
Progress on governance legislation at the state level has been slow. States lag behind the
federal government in the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility and Procurement laws and other PFM
reforms. As an incentive from the federal government, model fiscal responsibility and procurement
laws for the states were developed and were discussed with all 36 states in “clinics” held in three
different regional centers of the country in May/June 2008 with the support of development partners,
including the World Bank and DFID. This generated awareness and understanding among states,
some of which have gone ahead to either pass the laws (e.g. Bauchi) or prepared drafts bills (e.g.
Kaduna, Cross River, Lagos and Oyo State). There is ongoing dialogue between the Federal Ministry
of Finance and development partners on follow-up support for implementation of the laws at the state
level. Going forward, the major challenge is to get all states to pass these laws and strengthen
capacity for implementation, compliance and monitoring at both federal and sub-national levels.
37.
With the Bank support under the EMCAP and ERGP, Nigeria adopted the Accounting
Transactions Recording & Reporting System which enables electronic recording of treasury
transactions. This has been an important preparatory step for the adoption of a Government
Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) funded under ERGP. However,
there have been significant delays in implementation due to a number of constraints, including
weak capacity and lack of reform champions.
38.
At the sub-national level, only a few states have made tangible progress in improving the
budget process including new chart of account/budget classification, with Cross River, Kano and
Lagos states developing and using medium term expenditure and medium term sector financing
strategy, whilst others such as Kaduna and Bauchi are in the process of developing medium term
expenditure framework with Bank support under SGCBP and DFID under the State and Local
Government Program. However, at the state level the institutional and legal framework for
improved fiscal management is still weak. Recent state level PERs (e.g. Ekiti and Anambra)
undertaken by the Bank and other development partners suggest significant weaknesses in the
PFM system and would require continuous support in the current CPS.
39.
Significant progress was made in clearing a backlog of about five years of audit reports at
the federal level up to 2006 with the support of the Bank and DFID (under ERGP). With the support
of the Bank and DFID some states (e.g. Cross River, Kaduna, Kano and Lagos) are up to date with
the audited accounts of the state with reports being submitted within six months after end of the
financial year. However, there are weaknesses in the capacity of the state level public accounts
committees in scrutinizing the accounts which will be followed up under the current CPS.
40.
Public Procurement Policies and practices have improved and become relatively more
transparent and competitive, but implementation, compliance and monitoring are major
challenges. The Procurement Act was signed into law in June 2007. The adoption of the Public
Procurement Law and wide dissemination has resulted in an increased demand for accountability
by the public. government sources acknowledge significant savings (Governor of Central Bank)
of about $1 billion due to application of the Procurement Act in government expenditure, though
no independent figures are available yet. The procurement regulatory body—Bureau of Public
Procurement has been set up and is functional, whilst procurement tools (e.g. Implementation
Regulations and standard bidding documents) have been developed. However, the extent of
usage of these tools across government is yet to be assessed. At the state level, Due Process
Offices have been set up and government procurement is now more competitive and transparent,

67

with a significant proportion of government contracts advertised and awards published.
However, there are no official statistics to determine percentage of contracts awarded
competitively at the state level. Also only a few states have passed the Procurement Act to
provide the legal framework for public procurement.
41.
Information on spending and balances on crude oil revenue is regularly presented to the
National Assembly. There is also regular dissemination of revenue allocations from federation
account at the Ministry of Finance website. The NEITI audits were done and reported for 19992004 and that of 2005 report is expected to be out in due course. NEITI has been supported by
development partners, including DFID and the World Bank, through a multi-donor trust fund.
42.
With the support of ERGP, the federal government developed and piloted a new
Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System in six MDAs (Education, Information,
Works, Finance and Budget Office, Foreign Affairs and National Planning Commission). This
has contributed to the elimination of ghost workers and to savings estimated at about N500
million per month. This is a significant achievement given that the wage bill is one of the big
public expenditure items for MDAs and vulnerable to fraud which undermines the quality of
public expenditure. Given the success of the pilot phase, the federal government has decided to
scale up IPPIS to the entire public service with its own funding. The major constraint to be
addressed remains capacity in the Federal government to implement policy reforms.
43.
Significant progress has been made in achieving improved accountability and oversight. The
three key oversight institutions supported by the CPS partners are the Office the Auditor-General of the
Federation, the National Assembly and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Over the last
two years the National Assembly has played much more constructive role in the budget processes,
which helped to discipline the budget cycle and improve the quality of the approved budget. This was
apparent in the 2007 budget process, though the process has been delayed for the 2008 budget. For the
first time, the National Assembly directed all MDAs to return undisbursed budget allocations to the
treasury at the end of 2007 financial year. The level of compliance by MDAs was quite high, while
sanctions were applied to those that tried to circumvent the directives. This saved the government a lot
of resources, but also highlighted the need to improve budget credibility.
44.
In improving performance of Auditor General’s Office, a few lead states are ahead of the
federal government with up to date published audited accounts of the state. These include Cross
River, Kaduna and Kano that publish annual audited accounts of the state within 6 months after
the end of the financial year. At the Federal level, only recently the backlog of audited reports up
to 2005 have been cleared, with 2006 report awaited. Among the lead states, SGCB Project is
supporting the office of Auditor General in Cross River and Kaduna states to strengthen their
oversight function. Support includes training and provision of logistic support and introduction
of computer assisted auditing to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the OAuG staff.
However, the lack of follow-up to audit reports by the PAC is a major problem and undermines
holding officials and agencies to account for misuse of public resources.
45.
The EFCC has been quite effective in investigating cases of high level corruption and
recovering stolen assets. To illustrate, the number of convictions increased from 20 to over 200
cases in 2008, whilst the recovery of assets increased from less than $1 billion in 2005 to above

68

$5 billion in 2008.2 In addition, the time needed to resolve cases had improved. A stronger
Commission had helped Nigeria to be delisted from the FATF-NCCT list in 2007, as well as gain
admission to the EGMONT Group of Financial Intelligence Units. Development partners,
including the World Bank have played a significant role in getting the Commission to where it is
today. The Bank’s ERGP has supported the building of human and physical capacity, including
training in investigative techniques, financial intelligence and cybercrime, as well as
computerization and development of communication strategy.
46.
Progress was slow with strengthening demand for change & public participation in decision
making. Efforts are on the way to achieve them in 2008. Participation in 2006 benchmarking was
almost as high as 2005 (33 States plus the Federal Capital Territories and Abuja, FCTA, compared to
35+FCTA in 2005). In an effort to boost participation, DFID is supporting a Coalition for Change
initiative which aims at bringing together civil society and other key stakeholders around specific
issues. The Bank has also supported civil society groups in building their capacity for budget
monitoring in 8 pilot states. This has improved participation in the budget process and demand for
more transparency in the allocation and use of public resources.
47.
Overall, the picture is quite positive on measures of corruption and public resource management.
Since 2005, some—although not all—of the Bank’s CPIA ratings also improved (Table 2.2).
Progress towards outcomes in the governance pillar was moderately satisfactory with visible
results achieved at the federal level but more to be done at the state level.

The CPSCR rates overall outcomes for 2005-2008 as moderately satisfactory in line with
IEG’s rating in its country assistance evaluation. IEG rated the period 1998-2007 moderately
unsatisfactory. By 2007 signs of more favourable outcomes were beginning to emerge as a result
of some of the reforms implemented by the team in 2004. The latter part of the review period
was rated moderately satisfactory.
49.
In order to respond to the critical country challenges as well as to increase aid
effectiveness, the 2005 CPS reflected the following key strategic principles and elements:

The ability to provide a short-term response towards selected “quick wins” balanced
with long-term transformational agenda;
A Lead state approach—to work with committed and capable partners in delivering
results that would encourage other states to improve governance and foundations for
non-oil growth;
MDGs focus—selectivity in terms of sectors and states to improve worst HD
indicators (polio, malaria, HIV/AIDS, safe water, maternal and child mortality);
Partnership with DFID to achieve better development results with limited resources;
A gradual increase of the IDA envelope both as measure of enhanced governance
and capacity improvement, as well as Bank’s commitment; and
Strengthened focus on portfolio management.

50.
The World Bank Group position and reputation were greatly enhanced during the CPS
period with a strong impact on partnership effectiveness. The strategy to identify quick wins in
the most urgent and critical areas worked well and facilitated the dialogue with the government
against a backdrop of increasing oil prices. During this period, Nigeria was re-classified to IDA
only status, the country signed a debt relief agreement with the Paris and London Clubs of
creditors, its public debt declined from 57% of GDP in 2003 to below 5% in 2006, the Abacha
stolen assets were successfully retrieved and utilized in a transparent manner and the oil-price
fiscal rule was successfully implemented. The CPS Progress Report also reflected the shift in
priorities of the incoming administration towards infrastructure and power.
51.
The strategy that was implemented envisaged a gradual increase in IDA lending. Bank
investment lending rose steadily from an average $500 million commitment per year from FY05-08
to an expected $1 billion or more in FY09. DFID grants rose from £80 million to £100 million over
the period of the 2005 CPS and will increase to £140 million by FY11. The Bank portfolio currently
comprises 26 projects and 2 GEF projects, with a volume that has more than doubled from US$1.5
billion in FY05 to about US$3.5 billion in FY09. Infrastructure and human development comprise
almost two-thirds of the lending portfolio. Approximately US$2.35 billion remains to be disbursed as
of February 2009.3 Nigeria is also involved in several regional initiatives such as the: (1) West Africa
Gas Pipeline to secure reliable access to cheap and quality energy; (2) the Abidjan-Lagos transport
and trade facilitation project (FY10) to support trade facilitation measures and fund activities to
combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and provide treatment; (3) collaborative efforts in West and Central
Africa to improve air transport safety and security; and (4) joint management of shared water
resources for multi-purpose utilization in the Niger River Basin and Lake Chad. Table 2.3 reflects
actual versus planned lending during FY05-09.

The remaining FY09 pipeline includes Electricity and Gas Improvement, Second HIV/AIDS Program
Development, Lagos Eko Education Project and Additional Financing for the Malaria Booster Project.

New lending emphasized infrastructure projects and additional financing of successful
operations in line with emerging priorities of the new administration. IDA lending over the last two
years of the 2005 CPS reflects these shifts towards infrastructure projects (Federal Roads, Rural
Access and Mobility Project, and power sector (National Energy Project) as envisaged by the
Progress Report, CPSPR. The share of successful CDD-type operations significantly increased as a
result of the approval of Fadama 3 and Community Social Development Projects, which calls for
greater emphasis on sustainability of these investments and strengthening implementation capacity at
the state level all over the country. The team demonstrated the ability to respond to the emergency
case of Avian Flu with unprecedented speed to prepare and approve the emergency project.
53.
Portfolio Performance. In the early part of the CPS period, portfolio performance
indicators improved: the percentage of commitments at risk dropped from 43 percent in FY05 to
16 percent in FY07 (below that of the Africa region), and disbursement ratios improved to higher
than Bank-wide and Africa region levels. The improvements were due to project restructurings
which allocated resources to better performing states, more flexible and simplified Bank
procedures, and improved counterpart funding. In FY08 and early FY09, however, portfolio
indicators weakened (the disbursement rate fell to 12.4 percent in February 2009 and
commitments at risk rose to 38 percent). This was due to greater reliance on state level
implementation coupled with uneven capacity across the states, change in government and large

71

increase in number and volume of projects. In response to the decrease in portfolio performance,
the government and Bank have carried out intensive efforts to improve project readiness,
increase disbursements and strengthen implementation to achieve results.4
54.
Efforts were also undertaken to start to prepare and implement projects, initially
designed for lead states, in non-lead states. Examples include DFID in Jigawa, and the WB with
education project in Kwara and rural roads project in Osun State. These decisions were taken in
response to strong demand and commitment to sector reforms in these states.
55.
The partnership between the WB and DFID has been most effective at strategic level and
policy dialogue, in TA and ESW. Development partners’ effort to fill the knowledge gap resulted
in the joint preparation of the Country Economic Memorandum, Education PER, 24 policy
papers (as the basis of introductory discussions with the incoming administration after the
elections of 2007) and in conducting state level ICA. The partnership was effective in the
coordination of governance and HIV/AIDS projects as well in the move towards joint
programming in health and growth interventions. Previous efforts at joint design had been
hampered by conflicting internal procedures and processes.

The AAA program was fully consistent with the priorities set by the 2005 CPS and
outperformed in filling the knowledge gap, identified as one of the key constraints at the time of
the 2005 CPS. AAA was characterized by strong analytical focus, topic relevance for the country

Actions agreed at a Portfolio Implementation Review in May 2008 are being closely monitored, particularly for
projects at risk. Actions include training for project implementation, contract management, strengthening due
diligence in selecting contractors and awarding contracts., The Government and Country Team have been taking

following up on Quality Enhancement Reviews with more robust appraisals of implementation arrangements,
particularly for projects at the state level, and improved results frameworks.

own priorities and quick response to the government needs. In addition to core diagnostic
studies, the Bank prepared AAA pieces that enhanced the knowledge on science and technology
aspects of tertiary education, public expenditure trends in agriculture, features of fiscal
federalism in Nigeria, and institutional weaknesses of primary health care system at the state
level. The Bank responded to the government’s demand for relatively short policy notes and
analytical studies on specific aspects of sector reforms that could be prepared quickly. A series of
policy notes proved to be effective in providing a basis for continuous policy dialogue.
V. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
57.
Improving governance remains at the heart of further sustainable development in
Nigeria, at the federal level and in particular at the state level. Most of the governance reforms
were undertaken by the federal government, and states, with a few exceptions, lag behind in
terms of establishing the legal framework and implementation. Given the central role of states in
delivery of social services, this undermines the transparency, accountability, and effectiveness of
efforts to achieve MDGs. Continued efforts in public financial management and procurement, at
both the state and federal levels, are required. Implementation of reforms should receive
particular attention.
58.
Non-oil growth remains key to reducing poverty. Limited progress in power and transport
development, notwithstanding considerable efforts, point to the need for continued focus in these
areas, in particular on public private partnership. In energy, an independent regulator, the Nigeria
Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) was established, a multi-year tariff schedule was
adopted that will move electricity tariffs toward cost-recovery levels, and the sector was
unbundled into 11 distribution companies, one transmission company, and six generation
companies. However, given the poor state of power availability and reliability in the country,
further work is needed to increase power generation capacity and strengthen the management of
the unbundled companies to ensure an improved energy supply. Promising work on assessing
barriers to doing business could be maintained as well as building on the good progress made to
enhance agricultural productivity.
59.
In the area of human development partnership, efforts should focus at the state level, where
the main services are delivered. The partnership should: (i) build on successes in policy dialogue and
project implementation at federal and state levels; (ii) continue with policy dialogue for addressing
institutional weaknesses and systemic issues; (iii) intensify work on sustainability of social CDD
operations; and (iv) pilot conditional cash transfer initiative in one of the Northern states.
60.
The experience in the health sector with limited institutional changes points to the need to
adopt the health systems approach. This will necessitate moving away from the single vertical
disease approaches implemented in the past towards broader programmatic and sector-wide
approaches. Although the partnership should continue to support existing specific initiatives, the
emphasis should shift towards providing support for fully costed national strategic plans at both the
Federal and State levels. Greater mobilization of communities in order to expand access to health and
nutrition services and to foster greater accountability in service delivery should also be encouraged.
61.
The considerable success of the CDD approach suggests the need to move to a larger
scale operation that will include more communities and also integrate both the Local and State

73

Government in the process. This will ensure sustainability and maintenance of the social
infrastructures. The mechanism can also be used to provide demand side support to the extreme
poor for utilization of the services provided. The CDD mechanism for Conditional Cash Transfer
and Youth Employment could potentially be supported under the current CPS.
62.
Due to the importance of improving governance at the state level, partnership support
could take the form of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) in states that have a track record
of good performance and which show a willingness to undertake further reforms. Drawing on
experience in other countries, this instrument appears particularly well suited to supporting
policy dialogue on a wide-ranging and inter-related reforms and may prove particularly effective
in the Nigerian context. State DPOs can be supported by related investment lending to build
capacity or by other investments. The package of financial support would be a strong incentive
for states to pursue reforms.
63.
The lead state approach and process raised several issues, particularly with the
Governors of the “non-selected” states who urged the federal government to change or even to
abandon the strategy. Firstly, additional time was needed to design project interventions in
conjunction with building capacity to implement them in the states. Secondly, support to one of
the lead states was scaled down and suspended in 2006 when a joint Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Review found evidence of misuse of funds. In addition, the selection of
the five states excluded the poorest; although the five lead states cover some 21 percent of the
population and 23 percent of Nigeria’s poor. From a political standpoint, the five lead states were
in only four of the six major geo-political zones, in a setting where the federal government
strives for balance among the six zones; as a result, the federal government was not fully
committed to the whole lead states approach. Finally, there was no exit strategy for the
partnership in the event that a state fell out of compliance with the selection criteria. Going
forward, the state level engagement would need to be differentiated to: (i) target the poorest
states with lowest social development indicators (e.g. child and maternal health), but which have
demonstrated a commitment to overall sectoral reform and to the establishment of viable
fiduciary systems; (ii) incentivize those states with commitment to reforms in governance and
public expenditure management; and (iii) states which could assist to boost non-oil growth.
64.
The Bank should continue to help strengthen development partner coordination and
harmonization. The partnership with DFID should be expanded to bring other development
partners on board. Particular attention should be paid to improving donor coordination and
harmonization at the project level.

NACA and SACAs strengthened to implement ‘Three Ones’: i.e. a) coordinated

budget line from government and therefore sustainability in the HIV/AIDS response.
Realization of SACAs’ coordination mandate relies on other development partners to
channel information through SACAs—commitment to this is now growing.
• Monitoring and evaluation system implemented in 18 states by 2008. Progress is good
however the M&E system remains relatively weak due to the complexity of the institutional
architecture of AIDS (HIV/AIDS M&E system relies on the functioning of M&E systems
within line ministries, CSOs etc) and due to lack of capacity at all levels.
• Increased access to prevention, VCT, care and support services. 15% of 15-49 year olds
received VCT by 2007. Outcome achieved. Recent initiative launched by Vice President to
provide universal access to VCT for all eligible Nigerians between 15—49. Challenge
remains to ensure the availability of and access to appropriate services post-VCT.
• Implemented Family Life and HIV/AIDS curriculum in 50% of schools in 8 states by
2009.

two years. Incomes rose by 60 percent between 2005 and 2007 among people
participating in the project, surpassing the goal of 20 percent. The project’s impact on
income is likely to grow in the future, since beneficiaries acquired productive assets that
could increase their income overtime.
The project’s impact on productive asset acquisition is significant. The project led to a
590 percent increase in the value of group-owned productive assets. The dramatic
increase in value is mainly due to the cash transfer from the 70 percent matching fund
that the project provides to the Fadama user groups. The value of individual assets grew
by 49 percent.
Fadama II succeeded in raising the value of the productive assets of the poorest
populations more significantly than for the other groups. The average value of their
group productive assets increased from Naira 10,000 (approximately $89) in 2004-2005
to naira (470,865 (approximately $3990) Compared to female non-beneficiaries, the
value of female beneficiaries’ group productive assets increased by 331 percent.
Fadama II had positive near-term impacts on beneficiaries’ access to markets and
transport costs. Compared to non –beneficiaries, the distance and travel time to the
nearest market and travel cost decline significantly.
Target for MFI's has been exceeded (5 vs. 2)
MSME downscaling yet to start.

ANNEX 3: IFC SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT REFORMS IN NIGERIA’S POWER SECTOR:
THE GEOMETRIC POWER PROJECT
1.
Nigeria’s power sector is facing tremendous challenges. It is currently estimated that
only approximately 60 percent of the population has access to electricity, with only a fifth of
rural households covered. The country’s installed generation capacity is estimated at
approximately 7,000 MW, although the average generation supply in 2007 was below
3,000 MW. Poor maintenance conditions and limited access to fuel means that plants are rarely
operated at capacity and thus meet less than 30 percent of Nigeria’s estimated 10,000 MW
electricity demand. Furthermore, the country’s transmission and distribution networks are
generally dilapidated and have been poorly maintained, resulting in a high level of technical
losses. Finally, the distribution system’s financial situation is strained due to high non-technical
losses and low collection levels. This situation, coupled with electricity tariffs insufficient to
recover costs, has resulted in an electricity sector that is at present financially insolvent, in need
of continuous governmental budgetary support, and extremely unreliable in terms of service. The
current severe power shortages are considered to be a major barrier to economic growth, and it is
estimated that around 90 percent of industrial customers and a large proportion of SMEs and
residential customers have their own independent source of power generation, at a huge cost to
themselves, the economy and the environment. A key to beginning to resolve the power problem
in Nigeria is getting more private sector participation.
2.
IFC has been working with a Nigerian sponsor on the development of an independent
power project, Geometric Power, since 2004. The project entails the development of the
electricity infrastructure to provide reliable power supply to the city of Aba, an industrial town
and commercial hub in South Eastern Nigeria. The Project comprises the design, construction,
ownership and operation of: (i) a 188 MW gas fired open-cycle power plant; (ii) an associated
transmission/distribution network, including substations, to serve mostly industrial customers
located in the city of Aba; and (iii) a 27 kilometer gas pipeline to service the power plant. The
project also entails the refurbishment, lease and operation of an existing distribution network.
IFC played a key role in the early stages of the project’s development, by providing TA through
the Ireland/IFC Technical Assistance Trust Fund and IFC Technical Assistance, which supported
the project’s technical, financial and legal analysis. In June 2008, IFC’s board approved an earlystage equity investment in the Company prior to the project reaching financial close, which is
expected to catalyze additional investments from local and/or international equity investors and
signal IFC’s initial support for FGN’s efforts to attract private participation in the power sector.
The early-stage equity investment will allow IFC to continue supporting the sponsor in trying to
achieve satisfactory resolution during the final stages of the project development of certain
outstanding regulatory and contractual issues, thereby facilitating the process to reach financial
close.
3.
The project will generate, transmit and distribute electricity to an estimated 89,000
residential households and 25,000 commercial and industrial customers with reliable and cost
effective natural gas-based electricity. The project will be among the first private power plants
built since the March 2005 passage of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act that terminated the
electricity monopoly of National Electric Power Authority and opened Nigeria’s electricity
sector to private investors, and the first major Independent Power Producer project developed in
Nigeria without a government guarantee, as well as the first being developed by a local sponsor.
85

IFC’s investment in the project is expected to demonstrate the ability of the private sector to
provide an integrated solution to the pervasive lack of grid-based electricity supply in Nigeria,
using the city of Aba as a test case, with replication potential in other parts of country.
4.
The project has the potential to eliminate Aba’s power shortages, which are constraining
the city’s economic growth and development. The project’s investment in transmission and
distribution to serve industrial customers should also reduce losses and increase operational
efficiency and reliability. Furthermore, the project is expected to largely improve the
competitiveness of a large number of industries located in the city of Aba, operating in a variety
of sectors such as paper, glass and soap manufacturing, bottling, and soft drink producers, among
others, most of which currently rely partially or entirely on diesel or HFO self-generation, at a
cost up to 100% higher than that of the project. In particular, the project will supply electricity to
Aba’s shoe manufacturing industry, which produces about 80% of the shoes sold in Nigeria,
made mostly by hand and with rudimentary electricity provided by small gasoline generators.
5.
Finally, the project is expected to result in the displacement of oil powered electricity
generation with gas powered generation using associated gas, currently being flared, from an
existing oil field, thereby leading to a significant reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions.

ANNEX 5: LAGOS PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, MARCH 2009
I. Background and the State Context
A.

Population Growth and Economic Contribution

1.
By most estimates, Lagos is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. In 1999, the
United Nations predicted that the city's metropolitan area, which had only about 290,000
inhabitants in 1950, would exceed 20 million by 2010 and thus become one of the ten most
populated cities in the world. The growth rate has subsided a bit, but has still averaged 4% over
the past decade. The resulting density on 356,861 hectares of land is mind-boggling. However,
the 2006 national census presents a different picture. The federal census of 2006 pegs Lagos’
population at 9 million in 2006, compared to the 17 million estimate used by the State’s own
Central Office of Statistics.
2.
Lagos’ contribution to Nigeria’s economy is strong. Lagos’ contribution to Nigeria’s
GDP and non-oil GDP is estimated at about 12 percent and 19 percent respectively.1 The city is
by far the most important centre of economic activity in Nigeria. It is a financial centre and a key
communications and transportation hub, as well as headquarters to many major national and
regional industrial, manufacturing and financial concerns. Lagos’ 180 km coastline is home to two
ports (TinCan Island and Apapa) that account for some 60% of the country’s trading activity, while
its airport handles 62% of the combined domestic and international passenger traffic (2006).
3.
Based on preliminary GDP estimates for Lagos,2
annual growth has been at double digit rates from 2000
to 2007, faster than the national rate. That growth was
driven largely by the services sector (including wholesale
and retail trade) accounting for 75% of the State’s overall
GDP growth. Wholesale and retail trade represents more
than 50 percent of that services sector. Manufacturing’s
contribution to local GDP growth was a healthy 23%,
while primary activity (agriculture, fishing, mining, etc)
contributed a negligible 2% over the same period. The
informal sector, which represents about 45 percent of the
State economy in terms of output and employment,
constitutes the main source of income for the majority of
city’s households (Figure 5.1).
4.
Nigeria’s non-oil economic future and Lagos’
growth are tied. As it so often happens in mega-cities,
wholesale and retail trade, light manufacturing,
construction and information, communication and
technology are the four areas where Lagos is deemed to
have a clear competitive advantage for the non-oil growth

of Nigeria’s economy. These are the high-growth areas with strong prospects for job creation.3
The State Government has focused its attention on these four areas as well as on tourism and
leisure in order to harness Lagos’ potential and turn the city into an even more powerful centre
within the country and the region. However, before this can be fully accomplished, a few
obstacles need to be dealt with. Those constraints include limited and decrepit infrastructure
(urban transit system and power supply), inadequate human capital, a discouraging investment
climate, and limited access to finance, among other things.
B.

Recent Political Developments

5.
Like Nigeria as a whole Lagos has enjoyed continuous democracy since 1999. The
State is ruled by a minority party, the Action Congress, which controls the Office of Governor as
well as the State house of assembly. The previous and current governors are from the Action
Congress, and this has resulted in some continuity and consistency in State policy and
development priorities over the last decade. The State Government has furbished and established
its credentials in the past eight years by promoting consultative and participatory policy-making
initiatives. It has also introduced a participatory planning process (the Ehingbeti Forum) that
actively involves the private sector and civil society. Development priorities such as the State’s
Ten-Point Agenda (TPA) and the Lagos State Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy are vigorously debated among all stakeholders. To ensure an enduring and productive
relationship between the executive and legislative arms of government, the current
administration created a quarterly forum where Lagos lawmakers at the State and federal levels
as well as the entire State executive council come together to work towards a common legislative
agenda for the State at all levels.
C.

Recent Fiscal Developments

6.
Lagos fiscal profile has improved over the years. Lagos State’s 2007 budget deficit of
about N29 billion has largely been financed through domestic borrowing. Fitch assigned Lagos
a B+ rating for the State’s long-term foreign and local currency debt. The 2008 bond issuance
program—as part of the State’s N275 billion bond financing series—was successful with all the
first series of N50 billion over-subscribed.4
7.
With a strong local non-oil economy and a better revenue mobilization mechanism,
Lagos public resources increased significantly. Internal generated revenues (IGR) rose
significantly over the period 1999-2008. Until 1999, Lagos was generating N600 million a
month. That amount has increased to N8 billion monthly since 2007. Indications are that the IGR
has reached about 14 billion per month in 2009. This has made Lagos much less reliant on oil
revenues, and as a result the State’s spending patterns are more stable. This reliance on IGR also
provides Lagos with more incentives to administer taxes assiduously while fostering more
accountability in terms of services delivery. The State aims to save 15% of IGR per year in a
capital expenditure and contingency fund.

This bond issuance is to help finance two rail lines including the 37-km, 13-station Redline linking Agbado to Marina.

90

8.
Since 2004, there has been a marked shift in resources allocation away from recurrent
expenditures into capital expenditures, in keeping with the government focus in infrastructure
renewal. The share of capital spending in total expenditure represented about 50% in 2007,
compared to about 19% in 1999. The State government made a determined effort at allocating
higher capital budget envelops to priority sectors mostly in the area of transports, environment
(drainage and waste management), health and education.
D.

Recent Structural Reforms

9.
The Government of Lagos has made progress in implementing two sets of reforms
across sectors. The first set of reforms centers on the two sides of the State budget coin,
revenues and expenditures. On the revenue side, reforms have focused on restructuring the
State’s Internal Revenue Service in order to enhance revenue collection. This required the
computerization of the service, the introduction of an Electronic Banking System of revenue
collection and monitoring and the subsequent creation of a more comprehensive taxpayer
database. However, a lot more needs to be done in terms of budget preparation, implementation,
and monitoring. On the expenditures front, the accounting and reporting processes were greatly
improved with the formulation and regular publication of audited fiscal reports. To harmonize
the State reforms with those at the federal levels, Lagos has recently tabled the Procurement and
Fiscal Responsibility bills at the State House of Assembly. In modernizing it public finance
management legislation and aligning its legislation with reforms carried out at the national level,
the local government is establishing a higher standard of transparency, accountability and fiscal
reporting system.
10.
The second set of the reform relates to the business environment for private sector
development and the ease of doing business. Reforms here include the enactment of a publicprivate partnership law and the creation of a management agency5 (within the governor’s office)
to develop PPP policy and regulations that have been instrumental in enabling the private sector
to engage in a seamless manner, with PPP initially likely to be focused on waste management,
water, commercial infrastructure and transport. Lagos has taken the lead in the implementation
of reforms that make it a lot easier to do business in the State, thanks to the ICP co-funded by
DFID and the WB. Enhancing the performance of the judiciary is also on the agenda. Here the
focus has been on skills development for the judiciary and rapid response mechanisms to deal
with violent crime in partnership with the private sector. All these actions are designed to make
the administration of justice faster, simpler, more efficient and yet more accessible. In addition,
Lagos adopted new High Court rules for civil procedures aimed at expediting dispute resolution
(front-loading of evidence, pre-trial hearings, and stricter deadlines for actions). Lagos has also
introduced a fixed schedule for property assessment in an effort to alleviate the burdensome land
transfer process. Lagos introduced “Operation 30/30”, which sets a 30-day time limit for
government officials to process building permits. To expedite the time required for registering a
business, Lagos will have two “One Stop Investment Centers”. These are locations where
investors find all agencies relevant for setting up a business, eliminating the cumbersome task of
visiting every agency separately.

II. LAGOS GOVERNMENT STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
11.
While building on the achievements of the previous administration, the current
administration’s vision is to transform Lagos into a global financial and economic hub that is
safe, secure, functional and productive. The policy of the current administration is focused on:
(i) broadening economic development in the non-oil economy; (ii) improving infrastructures; and
(iii) sustaining good governance through inclusive governance, improved accountability and
transparency, public sector reform and an emphasis on the rule of law. The TPA initiated in
2003, is the foundation upon which Lagos’ current administration is building. The TPA
objectives are the creation of an enabling environment for private sector-led growth, stimulation
and creation of gainful employment, and rebuilding Lagos as a model city-State. The TPA
includes the following 10 areas of focus:
•
•

•
•

•
•

•

Roads: the objective is to ensure aggressive road rehabilitation in all local
government areas and construction of new roads/bridges.
Transportation: the objective is to put in place an integrated mass transit program
with emphasis on road, rail and water transportation services through LAMATA,
and public-private sector partnership by strengthening traffic management
mechanisms, putting in place the first State-run rail services, and stimulating private
sector investment in ferry services.
Power & water supply: the objective is to increase power supply through the Lagos
IPP program (phase 1 and 2), and to grow water supply as well.
Environment and Physical planning: the objective is to make Lagos a model cityState by introducing a community-based waste management system, ensuring an
aggressive implementation of emission control standard, pursuing a systematic
physical planning for sustainable development, and establishing a disaster
management agency.
Shelter: options include ensuring provision of affordable mass housing schemes by
developing a more effective and responsive mortgage market, and developing
new/satellite towns.
Health: improve health services supply through expansion of neighborhood clinics,
the pursuit of secondary health program, the deepening of the existing blindness
prevention program, malaria control with focus on mothers and infants,
strengthening marine ambulance/emergency medical services, and enhancement of
medical personnel welfare.
Education: the main thrust is on building Millennium schools in all local
government areas, re-engineering and refurbishing primary schools, providing
massive rehabilitation and maintenance of existing schools and libraries, making
provision for school furniture and equipment. Reviewing the curriculum and
including entrepreneurial training, but also enhancing teachers’ welfare, improving
community-based vocational education, are all key elements of the State’s education
program. Another area of focus in education the enhancement of the State’s capacity
to supervise private sector education providers as a large percentage of the
population receives education services from the private sector.

92

•
•
•

Food security: options include: facilitation of sustainable food production and
processing, empowerment of farmers/fishermen cooperatives societies, and support
for strategic preservation and farm settlements development.
Employment: create more jobs by introducing graduate empowerment program,
executing infrastructure projects generating new job opportunities.
Revenue enhancement: options include diversifying revenue sources, widening tax
base, setting up effective revenue collection mechanisms, and developing a database
of taxpayers.

12.
Transforming Lagos into a global financial and economic hub that is safe, secure,
functional and productive, as indicated in the government strategy, would require mobilizing
new sources of finances, and developing stronger institutions to encourage private finance
infrastructures. To achieve this, the Lagos Government intends to increase its efforts in
implementing economic and social and structural reforms—to improve competitiveness, create a
business-friendly environment for investment, and accelerate private-sector-led growth. The
government is determined to maximize the job creation effect and the poverty-reduction impact.
Lagos fiscal policy is built on higher internal generated revenues, rationalized public
expenditures and better targeting of spending to priority sectors. Total internal generated
revenues are expected to grow at Naira 15 billion per month over the period 2009—2011. To
confirm its commitment to infrastructure development, the government aims to increase the
share devoted to capital budget at 60 percent of the overall budget.
13.
By launching this ambitious reform agenda and improving its fiscal performance, the
Lagos State Government aims to improve the availability of and access to basic public goods
and services. Noticeable positive results have been achieved by the State in transportation, flood
control, and waste management. But there remain challenges.
III. PROGRESS TOWARD THE TEN-POINT AGENDA: IMPLEMENTATION AND CHALLENGES
A.

Improving the Mass Transit in Lagos

14.
The local government is making efforts to remove constraints to efficient transit
operations in Lagos, with support from the World Bank. The objective of the government is to
put in place an integrated system of mass transit. The creation of the Lagos Metropolitan Area
Transport Authority in 2003 has given a new impetus for policy development in the
transportation sector and the inclusion of the private sector in the provision of public transit
services. Ongoing action includes building and maintenance of strategic roads, expressways, and
bridges through increased public resource allocations to the sector. As part of a phased intermodal transport program, the first BRT was introduced in 2008. This is a notable achievement
and the number of high-speed BRT buses has gone from 126 to 246 by the end of the year 2008.
Daily rider ship capacity now averages 180,000 persons. The implementation of BRT light
system in Lagos is the first example of a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving
public transport in Sub-Saharan Africa (see Box 5.1).

93

Box 5.1: Main Achievements in Transport Sector in Lagos
Among major achievements in the transportation sector, one would include: (i) the reduction in travel time along the
BRT corridor from 90 minutes to 55 minutes; (ii) the reduction in share of household expenditure devoted to
transportation from 17 to 13 percent; (iii) the strengthening of procurement arrangements and a 50%+ decrease in
the per-unit cost of road works; and (iv) creation of about 1 million person-day direct jobs.

15.
Though the ongoing reform program has been a success, it has raised the city residents’
expectations and the extension of the BRT service to other parts of Lagos metropolis is now
something the Government has to seriously consider. There is also a desire to improve upon the
BRT design elements to further enhance mobility by including other key elements of a BRT
system, such as the Intelligent Transport Systems, a modern fare collection technology, enhanced
berthing stations, a variety of car sizes, and integrated route structure. Continued support for the
transportation sector is required to maintain and extend the achievements. The setting up of a
dedicated Transport Fund should also help ensure adequate maintenance in the future.
B.

Improving Lagos Environment

16.
Success in developing a viable transit system however cannot be sustainable in the
absence of a reliable and predictable flood control mechanism. Flooding is a major issue in
Lagos, by its recurrence, frequency and severity and the impact on sizeable portions of the city
and its infrastructure. Recent actions taken by the government have however helped alleviate the
pain. Those actions include the removal of illegal buildings and other obstacles blocking the
drainage system, and the construction, dredging and cleaning of canals and other major
waterways. Achievements in flood control have contributed to another noticeable reduction in
the city’s notorious traffic jams.
17.
With support from the World Bank, the Lagos government has made striking progress
in the solid waste management, and Lagos has become a remarkably cleaner city. Lagos Waste
Management Authority, an autonomous agency, was created to manage the solid waste and to
contract out collection and disposal services to the private sector. The sector has been infused
with a massive increase in equipment by the private sector (compactor trucks) and the public
sector. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of solid waste reaching landfills, up
from an estimated 2924 tons/day in 2005 to 3956 tons/day in 2008. The improvement in waste
management has contributed to reducing pressure on the drainage system.
18.
Climate change is seen as development issues of unlimited proportion in Lagos. In spite
of the lack of hard data and tardiness in reporting, there is ample evidence of vulnerability
patterns and socio-economic impacts of climate variability and change. The increase in
frequency and ferocity of coastal erosion, flooding and sea surge, salt mater intrusion into
adjacent land, corruption of mangroves and wet lands as well as the millions of Logosians that
are annually flooded and displaced, all point to fact that the consequences of climate change is
already present in Lagos and more are to come. However, in this setting, poor people and areas
are particularly vulnerable and therefore the fastest and harsdest hit. Left unchecked, it has the
potential to hinder, abort and even reverse development progress including Lagos TPA
objectives. In addition to climate change related risks are the problems of pollution (industrial,
indoor and outdoor).

94

19.
The implication of the above risks if left to fester is a denuded environment that would
be perilous for the population and unprofitable for business. Moving forward, a combination of
adaptation and mitigation efforts would be vital. Adaptation measures would strengthen the
State, community and individual response to climate change. The mitigation measures such as
the use of benign energy recourses, reduction emissions and use of environmentally friendly
technologies would help protect the environment avoid the social costs and grow the economy.
Besides, addressing environmental concerns such as those enumerated above also provides
opportunity for real development in the areas new and innovative technologies; development of
early warning and early response systems for extreme events; development of innovative
adaptive financial tools such as insurance for flooding, drought and so on; and access to global
facilities pooled for developing climate change resilient and green economies. Luckily, most of
these environmental concerns enunciated above are recognized by the Lagos State Government.
C.

Challenges in Poverty Reduction and Improving Social Indicators in Lagos

20.
Lagos however faces challenges when it comes to improving the State’s social indicators
(Table 5.1).The percentage of people living in poverty has increased in Lagos between 1996 and
2004 from 53% to 63.58%, and the level of inequality is estimated at 0.64 in 2004.6 The poor
have lower utilization of health services and lower school enrollment rates as well.
21.
The Lagos household survey showed that despite the State’s high adult literacy level
(93%), access to education remains inadequate, especially among the poor. Recent income
distribution data suggest that only 57% in the poorest quintile attend secondary school, compared
to a 94% level in the highest quintile (CWIQ 2005). There are close to 2 million children out of
school7 and dropout rates remain high in Lagos where the opportunity cost of attending secondary
school is high and the availability of quality public secondary education is constrained.
22.
Lagos’ education sector faces several critical challenges. These include: (i) low access
to junior secondary and senior secondary education for the poor; (ii) poor quality of education at
all levels, leading to weak skills development and limited employability; (iii) inadequate funding
and lack of accountability/quality mechanisms; (iv) limited capacity for policy making,
management, planning and monitoring and evaluation; (v) misalignment of curriculum content
and labor market needs; and (vi) weak supervision and regulation of the large and growing
number of privately-run secondary schools in the State. (See Table 5.1)
23.
Despite the government’s best efforts, there are still some considerable challenges in
the health sector. These include: (i) inadequate funds for upgrading and building new healthcare
facilities; (ii) underdeveloped primary healthcare system which encourages patients to use
second-tier lower-quality healthcare facilities; (iii) patients’ use of and ‘unsafe’ medications; and
(iv) inadequate training of non-clinical care and after-care services personnel as well as
administrators.

6

These are the lastest poverty figures published by National Bureau of Statistics for 2004.
The EFA Action Plan from 2004 estimated the number of out of school children at 2.5 million; however the most
recent EMIS data suggests 1.3 million children between the age of 6 and 14 are not currently enrolled in school.

Box 5.2: Youth Employment Programs in Lagos
Lagos State has a growing population of unemployed, underemployed and unskilled youths. About 76 percent of the
annual 105,000 school leavers from Lagos State senior secondary schools cannot transit into the national tertiary
institutions. They are joined by an array of unemployed and underemployed graduates from the tertiary institutions.
In addition, about 500,000 youths released yearly after the compulsory service to the nation migrate to Lagos. This
growing population of unemployed, underemployed and unskilled youths is easily motivated to engage in criminal
activities.
To tackle the youth unemployment issue, Lagos State Government has put in place several programs that educate,
equip and empower the youths in Lagos State. These programs include: (i) youth farm settlement scheme; (ii) the
creation of Youth Institute which provides higher level technical skills to graduates of tertiary institutions; (iii)
vocational centres across Lagos State through Ministry of Women affairs in 14 fields; and (iv) establishment of job
registration centres in 10 Local Government Areas, (v) creation of about 1 million person-day direct jobs in
transport sector thanks to the road maintenance scheme.
Given that several Ministries and agencies are involved in the implementation of these programs, there is a need to
streamline the various programs.

24.
The challenge now is to sustain these successes in transport, flood control and waste
management. Ultimately, for it to matter, success has to be sustainable and it’s the ability of the
government to translate these achievements into more and better jobs, shorter commutes, lower
transport costs, lower-priced goods and services that will define the Lagos of the future. And on
that front the government is on the right track.
D.

Lagos State’s Fiscal Profile and Financing Gap

25.
Achievements in the-above three areas have been made possible in large part thanks to
major improvements in the State’s fiscal policies and better governance. This is particularly
evident when one considers progress made thus far in revenue diversification, revenue collection
and progress on governance in public finances management.
26.
While Lagos has improved its IGR, compared to other mega-cities, Lagos does not
draw much from its property tax base. The IGR in Lagos comes mainly from personal income
taxes as opposed to property taxes and there remains a large percentage of the population,
especially those in the informal sector that does not pay taxes. Lagos has one of the lowest
property tax rates in the world. Property taxes account for a substantial share of municipal
budgets around the world ranging from an average of 20% in India, over 50% in many Canadian
cities, and 70% in many cities in USA. It seems to most observers that property taxes present yet
another opportunity for Lagos to enhance its revenue profile.
27.
The funding gap for infrastructure is considerable in Lagos despite this positive fiscal
profile. Budgeted capital expenditures have reached N129.3billion in 2007 and are expected to
reach N247.7billion in 2009, but this is still small compared to the needs (Figure 5.2). Underinvestment in new infrastructure and weak maintenance of the existing ones has hampered
service quality. The ministry of economic planning and budget estimates that $50 billion would
be required between 2007 and 2015 for Lagos’ infrastructure development. And this does not
include subsequent maintenance and recurrent costs. The average annual capital budget required
for the future represents more than three times the overall proposed capital budget of 2009.

28.
To fulfill the investment needs in the near future, additional options of resources
mobilization needs to be explored. Reviewing the property tax rate can be explored further. In
addition to capital markets borrowing, developing an active and strategic public asset
management plans can also generate an abundant source of revenue for Lagos State. The
ongoing Lagos State asset identification exercise as well as the infrastructure assessment (roads
and drains) done by the Ministry of Works in 2004 was a first step toward an active management
of assets. An asset performance management will put in place process to manage, maintain, and
track assets - such as roads, buildings, equipment - from purchase to disposal and to use asset
data to operate more efficiently and make better business decision. For instance, many cities in
China8 have financed half or more of their urban infrastructures investment level from land lease,
while borrowing against the value of land on their balance sheets to finance much of the
remainder. However monetizing publicly-held land creates a set of risks on the fiscal side that
should be carefully identified and mitigated with the State financial management legislation.
E.

Governance and Building Institutions and Systems

29.
Lagos has achieved progress in improving economic governance. Lagos Government
has pursued reforms in fiscal management that yielded greater accountability and transparency in
the use of public resources with support from World Bank and DFID. A participatory approach
was introduced during the budget preparation process. Actions were also taken to improve the
quality of budget execution and treasury management. The accounting and reporting have also
improved with regular and timely publication of the audited fiscal reports. To ensure that public
finance reforms are built on solid regulatory foundations, Lagos State Government has also
embarked in the process modernizing its PFM legislation. The updating of the public finance law
and financial regulations as well as the audit law is underway.
30.
Despite this considerable progress in terms of governance, there remain many
challenges in Lagos’ PFM system. On budget preparation, the multi-year planning process is
8

still at an early stage. To sustain increasing spending in priority areas, it is crucial that the
budgetary allocation process be improved, by integrating the annual budget cycle into the
medium-term expenditure framework. Moving gradually to performance budgeting would also
help greatly. The mixed performance of capital budget (mentioned in the previous section) stems
from shortcomings in the budget execution process, and the overly centralized execution
function in the Governor’s office, among other reasons. The absence of procurement plans and
cash plans prevents the full implementation of the capital budget. At the same time, the limited
ability of public agencies to monitor and evaluate projects contributes to the mixed performance
of capital budget. The establishment of robust M&E systems in key MDAs is critical to Lagos’
development agenda. The full use of the integrated financial management information system
introduced since 2003 is critical to process and report on all government financial transactions
and improve transparency in government business.
31.
The State has paid considerable attention to introducing reforms that make the
administration of justice more efficient. With DFID support, the Lagos Government’s actions
on improving justice in commercial disputes include the implementation of the Bill of Sale
Registry and the upgrade of the Consumer Rights Protection Unit into a full-fledged agency.
Other actions include the introduction of a criminal case tracking system for use by all agencies
involved in the criminal justice system, the establishment of fast-track courts, and the
introduction of alternative dispute resolution services with citizen mediation centers. The
challenge now is how to sustain further reforms and to provide court employees with the
appropriate skills to implement the reforms.
32.
Enhancing the institutional and human capacity of the civil service to prepare,
implement, monitor and evaluate public programs is crucial in improving governance and
service delivery in Lagos. Three key obstacles prevent the effective implementation of policies
as they relate to the public service: (i) the lack of M&E instruments, making it difficult to
systematically keep track of and assess the performance of government agencies; (ii) the
systemic weakness in public sector institutional capacity and information systems; and (iii) the
weak coordination among MDAs. Going forward, introducing a performance reporting system to
inform the general public on MDAs performance in service delivery is critical.
33.
To tackle these challenges and help the administration in its mandate to modernize Lagos,
the government has initiated a long-term public service reform along several lines. An ambitious
program financed by the State government is currently developing a framework for public service
reform in a collaborative way for the 2008-2015 period. The program will include a strategic
management framework/roadmap, an activity management framework and impact assessment, a
capacity requirements (human and tools) to be implemented toward achieving development
objectives, and the tools for implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment. In
the short term, the performance reporting system should be introduced for selected MDAs such as
MDAs in charge of transport, and environment (flood control and waste management).

IV. DONORS CURRENT SUPPORT AND LESSONS LEARNED
34.
Lagos was a lead State under the 2005 CPS. Like the other lead States, Lagos was
selected based on the quality of its governance system and its strong commitment to reform. The
incidence and volume of poverty, the city’s potential as a growth pole and its experience with
existing donors’ projects also played a role in Lagos’ selection. In fact, Lagos has the World
Bank’s largest portfolio of support in Nigeria and benefits from a growing support from DFID as
well. Other donors such as the African Development Bank, Oxfam, USAID, the United Nations
agencies, and World Vision play active roles in Lagos’s TPA implementation.
A.

Areas of Current DFID and World Bank Support

35.
DFID currently has six programs in Lagos with a further one planned for
implementation in 2009-2010. The portfolio covers governance and PFM, systems support to the
education sector, malaria control, institutional development and reforms in the security and
justice sector, policy advisory facility for infrastructure projects, and economic growth and
private sector development. DFID’s support continues to centre on strengthening of government
institutions, capacity building, and improving accountability. Additionally, DFID projects
provide support for the enhancement and delivery of basic services in education.
36.
The World Bank has a current portfolio of more than $550 million, spread around
several areas of the TPA. This represents 20% of the overall IDA current commitment to
Nigeria. This large portfolio supports four selected areas of Lagos TPA: transportation, water,
environment, and health. It also covers activities related to improving governance and capacity
building, and private sector development. The overall objective of the current portfolio is to
assist the State government in its poverty reduction and economic growth plans. Some $300
million of the World Bank commitment covers two major projects on transportation and urban
development in Lagos. A third major project involves the nationwide Water Sector Reform
Project ($200 million) in which Lagos plays a crucial role. The project includes investments in
the water transmission and distribution systems, whereby major parts of the investment are
supporting significant operational improvements in the delivery of water services or progress in
the privatization of water delivery in the city. In addition to the above three major projects,
several nationwide and some select State projects cover Lagos, including: Fadama, HIV/AIDS,
community poverty reduction, local empowerment and environmental management and the
micro, small and medium enterprise projects. The Bank has two other projects in the pipeline for
Lagos: the Lagos Urban Transport Project II and the Lagos Eko Secondary Education Project).
37.
The Bank carried various studies on Lagos. These included fiduciary studies of the
State’s procurement and financial management systems, a study on Lagos State finance, State
and local government relationships. Jointly, the Bank and DFID undertook the Doing Business
Study project under the Investment Climate Program.
38.
There is little doubt that the DFID and the Bank’s current support is aligned with
Lagos’ stated development objectives as outlined in the TPA. The question however remains as
to whether instruments used and approaches in place are adequate.

100

B.

Lessons Learned

39.
The instruments and approaches used by donors in Lagos are the same ones used
elsewhere in Nigeria even though Lagos is different from other parts of Nigeria in terms of
financing gap, progress on reforms, and the complexity of mega-city issues. The instrument of
the WB past and current support to Lagos has been mostly a traditional project approach. During
the preparation of these projects the Lagos government and the Bank define specific project
components and interventions and identify a set of procurement inputs needed to carry out the
project. In most cases, these projects are not fully integrated to the State budget.
40.
From the perspective of the Lagos government, this traditional project-based
instrument is not appropriately adapted to Lagos’ specific environment and development
challenges. The delays, additional cost and unpredictable flow of funds during project
implementation are the main issues often identified by the State’s officials. In the view of the
Lagos government, the Bank fiduciary procedures and as well as the complexity of the Bank
safeguards policies are creating delays in implementing the Bank supported projects, for which
reason the Lagos government prefers to use its own resources and procedures to implement some
of the activities planned under the World Bank projects.
41.
The traditional project approach seems to work well when the focus is a single sector,
as shown by the recent successful implementation of the transport sector project. The Lagos
urban transportation project has leveraged reform within the sector and has contributed to
capacity building particularly in Lagos Metropolitan Area Transit Authority where the project is
mapped. According to the IEG report, the urban transit project has shown good results. It also
provides a good basis for planning further improvements and expansion in mass transit. This
traditional project-based approach however seems inadequate when the project is multi-sector in
scope or when the execution is under the authority of an agency outside the sponsoring MDA.
The Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project is a good example of a multisector project that struggles to achieve its objectives. The project’s preparation process itself has
had a good positive impact on Lagos, its implementation however was and still is a major
challenge. The myriad of coordination and execution activities across multiple MDAs proved an
insurmountable obstacle. The fact that the project’s managing unit is not under the State’
authority greatly limits the project’s ability to leverage existing progress in capacity building and
governance. It also reduced the interest, involvement and level of ownership of key participants.
42.
Other weaknesses of this traditional and project-based approach range from medium
and long-term sustainability issues to limited resources. Many past Bank interventions in Lagos
have suffered from problems of poor maintenance and sustainability as the State has often failed
to take ownership of the project(s). The Bank’s financial contribution to the project is also
usually small compared to the overall project costs. This makes it difficult to achieve tangible
results that often require concurrent and substantial support and reforms in multiple sectors. This
traditional project approach does not sufficiently leverage existing institutional development.
43.
In conclusion, the main lesson learned is that the impact of traditional project is limited
in Lagos particularly when it covers more than one area. Other instruments/options should be
considered, particularly when dealing with multi-sector issues. While it’s important to cover the

101

State’s development priority areas, donors need to be more strategically selective in their assistance
in order to improve the efficiency of resources mobilization, allocation and execution.
V. LOOKING FORWARD: THE NEW LAGOS PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (LPS)
A.

Strategic Focus

44.
The proposed strategic focus of the LPS is based on State’s needs and the lessons
learned during the implementation phase of current interventions. The primary criteria used to
determine ideal donors’ strategic positioning in Lagos is the alignment with the TPA, its priority
sectors, and success in tackling major challenges in the TPA implementation. In addition, the
November 2008 workshop and the continuous dialogue with Lagos government identified the
sectors to focus on and services to offer to respond most appropriately and effectively to the
State’s needs.
45.
The preceding analysis of comparative advantages and Lagos needs points out 3 clear
priority areas: (i) governance and capacity building, (ii) improving the business environment;
and (iii) better services delivery. Based on the needs analysis and above four main lessons and
the needs, a new LPS ought to deal with improving systems, policies, and institutions that will
sustain success already achieved by current administration in several critical areas. This implies
that donors’ future support needs to focus on renewing Lagos infrastructure through better
governance and capacity building. This will have a great impact on the State’s own emphasis on
non-oil economic sectors and the non-oil growth strategy of the current CPS.
46.
The focus will be around three major themes: (i) governance and capacity building;
(ii) improving the business environment; and (iii) better services delivery. The Bank and DFID
specific assistance (projects and analytical work) is formulated in the current CPS within a
result-oriented framework.
47.
Governance and capacity building. Donors’ current and future support should continue
on governance with two key areas: economic governance and access to justice. On economic
governance, the Bank should assist the government in analyzing options for further diversifying
IGR from PAYE. The support can include a review of the property tax base and rates, and an
assessment of active asset management tools or policies. The Bank could also help analyze
constraints to full and efficient implementation of the capital budget. Improving accountability
and transparency requires appropriate monitoring and evaluation system. The Lagos Strategy
should support the introduction of the monitoring and evaluation tool for select government
agencies (such as transportation, waste management, and water). In that regard, reforming the
State’s statistics agency is key to ensuring timely availability of quality data. On justice DFID
should continue to support the government’s reform agenda and contribute to further capacity
building.
48.
Improving the business environment. Continuing support is critical to Lagos. The
existing work has had great impact in improving the investment climate in the State.
49.
Better service delivery. The focus of the current portfolio on better service delivery is in a
few selected areas—transportation, water supply, waste management, flood control, and slums
upgrading. Additionally, support for the development of quality secondary education and
102

vocational training programs seems as critical since it directly contributes to the human capital
development agenda so vital to the State’s economy.
50.
Given the risks of climate change on Lagos, current and future LPS would need to
recognize, mainstream and build-in environmental sustainability costs especially that of
climate change risk related costs in its development aspirations to make it effective and long
lasting. Making Lagos State climate change resilient not only heralds a paradigm shift in
development planning but would in a greater or lesser extent determine the success or otherwise
of this strategic plan.
B.

New Approaches and Instruments

51.
Options of new instruments and approaches include sector-wide approach (SWAp)
and/or programmatic DPO (see Box 5.3).. A multi-sector SWAp can work for Lagos and can
focus on urban development issues. The potential good sector candidates are the three interconnected sectors (water supply, drainage, and waste management) and slums upgrading
program. Traditional sector specific projects do not seem best suited for the much needed
integrated approach to reforms and capacity building in these three sectors, including for the
reasons of weak intra- and inter-institutional coordination. Further, the slums upgrading needs a
comprehensive support rather than small and incremental action. Finally, tangible results in the
area of flood control and waste management need to be sustained under a more comprehensive
and appropriate approach with a stronger focus on results. Through a multi-sector SWAps,
donors can focus on the issues of greatest concern for livability, and the requirements for
enhancing Lagos productivity, management and financing as it was done during the preparation
phase of Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project.
52.
Lagos appears to be the best candidate for a ”pioneer” DPO, given the progress
achieved in improving its PFM-system, the reform-orientation of the State government, the
importance of the State for Nigeria and the inadequacy of fiscal resources (Fig. 5.3). The
government has made significant progress on fiscal and PFM reforms, including enhancement in
IGR. Lagos has also aligned its reforms with those at the federal level, by tabling the
Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility bills at the State House of Assembly. Other measures
include reforms related to improving the business environment and the justice system. A DPO
for Lagos will build on and sustain these measures, and help the government define and
implement the reforms in specific areas. DPO analytical underpinnings could include a public
expenditure and financial accountability exercise, led by the Lagos government. Assessing the
capital budget process in order to examine the main constraints to the full implementation will
help identify remedies that can improve budget performance. On the revenue side, reviewing the
property tax base and developing an active and strategic public asset management plans can be
done successfully through a DPO as well.

103

Box 5.3: SWAp and DPL Experience at Sub-national Levels
The Bank has implemented SWAp and DPO at sub-national levels. Experience with sub-national SWAp and DPO
has been generally positive. Such an approach and instrument can bridge financing gaps in State budgets, help
accelerate reforms and garner additional donor support, as well as improve relations between federal and subnational governments. The most substantial experience on this was made in India, where the Bank has provided $ 2
billion in policy-based loans to State governments over the past decade. Other successful SWAps at sub-national
levels include the Bosta Familla cash transfer program and multi-sectorial program in the State of Ceara (Brazil)
These sub-national SWAp and DPO have had a positive impact. A recent review of India’s experience paints a
generally positive picture. It reveals that States that benefited from such lending have made faster and more
thorough progress on fiscal management than those that did not.1 The first SWAp in Brazil’s Ceara State helped the
State government advance reforms in six critical areas, including traditional sectors like water sanitation, as well as
cross-sectoral areas like public sector management. The Brazilian experience highlights the ability to support
results-based government reform agenda as a key strength of multi-sectoral SWAps.

India: A Retrospective. Forthcoming.

53.
As with a SWAp, the impact of a successful DPO can go well beyond the specific issue
being addressed. Much like SWAp, a DPO can help bring to the forefront critical issues
related to the broader reform agenda. This includes fiscal, PFM, reforms related to the
investment climate, monitoring and evaluation. The DPL will permit to monitor the performance
of the Lagos development program regardless of funding sources. It will also permit more
predictable resources flow to the budget, taking a medium to long-term focus while generating
short-term results. Finally, by relying on the State’s institutions and procedures, the DPO will
strengthen overall capacity, systems, and ensure the sustainability of the broad reform program.

ANNEX 5.1: COORDINATION FRAMEWORK OF DONORS’ SUPPORT TO LAGOS
1. Donor coordination is essential for achieving aid effectiveness and for ensuring that
development partners’ resources contribute to Lagos State’s developmental efforts (Figure 5
below). Current coordination is that all development partners engage independently with Lagos
State government through the Ministry of Economic Planning and Budget. Thereafter,
engagement shifts more to an implementing MDA. Consequently, there has not been an
appropriate framework for the coordination of donor activities—the higher echelons of
government such as the Governor and MEPB are therefore not always aware of what assistance
is being rendered by a particular development partner in an MDA. Such non- coordination often
leads to duplication of effort and waste. Also, it is often not clear whether the support is
contributing to the strategic objective of the government. For the period of the LPS, DFID and
the WB propose that the below framework be used for donor coordination and oversight. The
framework distinguishes between two core tiers of donor coordination and oversight—strategic
level and tactical/operational level. The Steering Committee would have the Governor as its
Chair and other EXCO officials as members would also have Chief Officers of the development
partners as members. The committee would establish the strategic requirements—broad areas of
support—of the State and agree those in an MOU that would hold the State and development
partners mutually accountable to each other for the realization of the agreed objectives. All
development partners would then be required to work with the framework of delivering those
objectives in a cooperative and coordinated way.

the MOU would be developed by technical teams that involve politicians (Commissioners) with
