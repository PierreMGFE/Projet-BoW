EXECUTIVE S U M M A R Y
1.
F o l l o w i n g a decade o f r a p i d economic g r o w t h a n d social development, the
D o m i n i c a n R e p u b l i c (DR) today faces i m p o r t a n t challenges that threaten t h e prospects f o r
continued r a p i d progress. Among the main sources o f vulnerability are: (i)a difficult fiscal
situation now worsened by the global economic financial crisis; (ii)extremely high levels o f
poverty and inequality and limited capacity to implement counter-cyclical social policies; (iii)
competitiveness challenges deriving mainly from an inefficient energy sector and low skills
levels; and (iv) the negative implications o f climate change for the country’s important tourist
industry.

2.
T h e DR and t h e B a n k G r o u p have l o n g m a i n t a i n e d a close partnership, but the
t r a d i t i o n a l modalities o f engagement employed so f a r have yielded o n l y m i x e d results suggesting t h e need f o r new approaches. The Bank has generally been responsive to
Government requests for knowledge services and financing, but implementation has been slow affected by significant effectiveness delays for new operations and slow execution o f the
portfolio, largely due to fiscal constraints and capacity limitations. Nonetheless, Government
believes that the World Bank Group continues to be well positioned to help in addressing the
important development challenges that the country faces, and has been actively partnering with
the Bank in exploring the menu o f instruments that could most appropriately respond to the
country’s needs.
3.
In this context, t h e DR G o v e r n m e n t a n d t h e B a n k have been e x p l o r i n g new
modalities f o r cooperation - embodied in the present C P S - w h i c h w o u l d enable knowledge
a n d f i n a n c i a l resource transfer, but reduce o r a v o i d t h e bottlenecks w h i c h t o date have
slowed i m p l e m e n t a t i o n a n d the achievement o f results. The CPS i s fully aligned with the
priorities set forth by the Fernandez Administration and the key elements o f the National
Development Strategy which i s currently being finalized through a broad, participatory process.
Its main objective i s to support the country in reducing i t s vulnerability to internal and external
shocks while producing results for its citizens. This new CPS will promote synergies between
the work programs o f the entire World Bank Group - the IBRD, the IFC, and MIGA.

4.
T h e n e w Strategy will give special emphasis t o p r o t e c t i n g the p o o r w h i l e enhancing
competitiveness and strengthening p u b l i c institutions f o r p e r f o r m a n c e accountability in the
country. This objective and priority areas w i l l be addressed by implementing actions to achieve
4 strategic objectives: (i)
strengthen social cohesion and improve access to and quality o f social
promote competitiveness in a sustainable and resilient economic environment, (iii)
services, (ii)
enhance quality o f public expenditures and institutional development, and (iv) build capacity and
constituencies for reform.

5.
T h e proposed strategy will keep a flexible a p p r o a c h and b e based o n a c o m b i n a t i o n
of investment and policy-based lending, a n d a s t r o n g emphasis o n AAA w o r k - b o t h in
terms o f E S W and N o n - L e n d i n g Technical Assistance (NLTAs). The proposed strategy will
support the Government in producing results while strengthening accountability between public
sector agencies. B y working with non-traditional actors and focusing on strengthening oversight
mechanisms in the public sector, the proposed model w i l l also focus on demand-side governance
interventions to generate the right incentives for increasing accountability levels to the public
while strengthening checks and balances within the public sector. However, should the
Government’s reform program stall, macroeconomic conditions deteriorate significantly, or the
Bank fails to secure a credible policy matrix to underpin budgetary support lending, the Bank
vi

would rethink the balance between policy-based and investment lending. WBG synergies will
enhance this flexible approach allowing for the use o f diverse instruments.

6.

IFC’s approach during the upcoming CPS period will be two-fold. First, I F C will
continue working with the underserved segments o f the market, the ones having the highest
impact o n the bottom of the pyramid. Reaching out to microenterprises and small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) will be a key objective. Implied areas o f intervention will include access to
finance (trade, microfinance and SMEs), improving the business environment (Doing Business
Reform, Corporate Governance), access to basic infrastructure, and sustainable tourism
development. Opportunities in other growth and income generating sectors (agribusiness, general
manufacturing and so on) will be supported when leading to sustainable private sector
investment. I F C will also respond to the current financial crisis, with a particular focus on
existing clients and shorter term financing (notably trade financing). I F C investment and
advisory actions will include climate change mitigation (e.g. energy efficiency and renewable
energy), raising sustainability standards (environment, social, and corporate governance), and
linkages (e.g. small and medium enterprises).

7.
The new CPS will rely on donor coordination. The proposed approach i s fully
consistent with the principles agreed in the Paris Declaration, o f 2005: (i)ownership, (ii)
,alignment, (iii)harmonization, (iv) managing for results and (v) mutual accountability, In line
with these principles and according to the concrete recommendations emerging from the Accra
meeting in 2008, the proposed strategy provides special emphasis to increasing the scope o f
development policy dialogue at the national level, strengthening and taking advantage o f country
systems (when possible), welcoming and working with all the actors involved in development,
deepening the working relation with civil society, concentrating in achieving results, increasing
results’ transparency and accountability, and continuing to base conditionality on the countries’
development strategies.
8.
Risks. The main risks to this CPS emerge both from domestic and external factors.
Domestic factors include the need to have closer coordination between public sector agencies in
order to ensure a multi-sectoral approach to development. External factors are the risk o f major
external shocks that may inhibit the undertaking o f policy changes. The Government has made
progress over the recent years in mitigating many o f these factors and the proposed CPS will
support actions to further strengthening these mitigation actions.
9.

Executive Directors may wish to consider the following issues for discussion:
.

I s the focus given to improving performance and promoting accountability in the
social sectors adequate in light of the adverse effects that international financial
crisis may have in the DR?

Are the risks well identiped and mitigating factors sufficient for assuring the
likelihood of successful implementation?

FY10-FY13
I.I N T R O D U C T I O N
1.
Following a decade of rapid economic growth and social development, the
Dominican Republic (DR) today faces important challenges that threaten the prospects f o r
continued rapid progress. Among the main sources o f vulnerability are: (i)a difficult fiscal
situation now worsened by the global economic financial crisis; (ii)extremely high levels o f
poverty and inequality and limited capacity to implement counter-cyclical social policies; (iii)
competitiveness challenges derived mainly from an inefficient energy sector and low skills
levels; and (iv) the negative implications o f climate change for the country’s important tourist
industry. Moreover, the weakness o f public institutions - particularly with respect to their ability
to produce demonstrable results - adds to low levels o f trust in Government.

2.
The DR and the Bank Group have long maintained a close partnership, but the
traditional modalities o f engagement employed so far have yielded only mixed results suggesting the need for new approaches. The Bank has generally been responsive to
Government requests for knowledge services and financing, but implementation has been slow affected by significant effectiveness delays for new operations and slow execution o f the
portfolio, largely due in part to fiscal constraints and capacity limitations. Nonetheless,
Government believes that the World Bank Group continues to be well positioned to help it
address the important development challenges that the country faces.
3.
In this context, the DR Government and the B a n k have been exploring new
modalities for cooperation - embodied in the present CPS - which would enable knowledge
and financial resource transfer, but reduce o r avoid the bottlenecks which to date have
slowed implementation and the achievement o f results. The CPS i s fully aligned with the
priorities set forth by the Fernandez Administration and the key elements o f the National
Development Strategy which i s currently being finalized through a broad, participatory process.
I t s main objective i s to support the country in reducing i t s vulnerability to internal and external
shocks while producing results for i t s citizens. This new CPS will promote synergies between
the work programs o f the entire World Bank Group - the IBRD, the IFC, and MIGA.

A.

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CONTEXT

4.
The Dominican Republic i s a middle income country (US$3,990 per capita income)
and the second largest country in the Caribbean, both by land mass and population, after
Cuba. Tourism, mining and light manufacturing are the main exports. The business
environment has been improving, foreign direct investment was about 4 percent o f national
income in 2007 and remittances were about 10 percent o f GDP. For over a decade the D R has
had competitive elections and peaceful transitions o f the party in power.
5.
President Fernandez was reelected f o r a second consecutive term in M a y 2008 with
53.8 per cent of the vote and his party, PLD (Partido de l a Liberacion Dominicana), holds a
majority in both Chambers o f Congress
this, in turn, provides a unique window o f

-

FYI 0-13 Countw Purtnershlu Strutem for the Dominican Remblic

opportunity to move forward on a reform agenda. President Fernandez i s well positioned to
implement a reform agenda that focuses on addressing the energy crisis, fighting corruption and
building institutions, and improving competitiveness and the investment climate.

6. President Fernandez recently convened a National Summit to define a long-term
national development strategy. The process provides a good opportunity for consensus
building and for aligning the Bank’s new CPS to the country’s priorities - as reflected in the new
national strategy.
7. I n the context o f an ongoing Constitutional Reform, President Fernandez has signed an
agreement with leaders of the opposition parties. This has helped create consensus among
political actors on key issues included in the Constitutional Reform. Important elements include
alignment o f the country’s electoral calendar and elimination o f the presidential reelection clause‘
In order to align electoral calendars, those elected for Congress in 2010 will serve for 6 years
(instead o f 4). The elimination o f the presidential reelection clause was approved in conjunction
with the possibility o f the return o f presidents to office after one period outside Government.

RECENT
ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS

Recent Macroeconomic Developments

8. I n the two years prior to the current international financial crisis, the DR enjoyed
strong economic growth - 10.7 percent in 2006 and 8.5 percent in 2007 - well above the Latin
American and Caribbean Region (LCR) regional average (Table 1). Growth in 2008 was about
5.3 percent, s t i l l above the regional average o f 4.6 percent. Positive internal and external factors
supported this economic expansion. Internally, the Government implemented structural reforms
to enhance fiscal sustainability : rationalizing spending, improving revenue collection and debt
management, institutionalizing the budgetary process, and strengthening the financial system.
Fuelled by strong private consumption and investment demand, manufacturing and services communications, commerce, tourism - grew strongly. Positive external factors included strong
global growth and ample foreign exchange inflows from tourism, remittances, and foreign direct
investment.
9. During 2005-2007, the DR achieved positive results in terms of fiscal balances, debt and
international reserves ratios, and inflation. The primary fiscal surplus reached 1.3 percentage
points o f GDP in 2007, up from 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent in 2006 and 2005 respectively (Table
1). This improvement was primarily due to increased revenues, boosted by tax reforms and better
revenue administration, as well as increased nickel exports in 2007. Nonetheless, the tax base
remained narrow, and public expenditures have been slowly rising as a percentage o f GDP since
2005. Large and poorly targeted subsidy programs (for electricity and liquefied gas) were among
the main causes o f increased spending.
For 2008, the overall deficit was 3.0 percent of GDP, and the primary deficit was
estimated at about 1.2 percent of GDP, mainly due to increased subsidies starting in early
2008 and to increased spending in the run-up to the M a y Presidential elections. To avoid the full
pass-through o f rising international prices, the Government granted subsidies on food items
(bread, milk, rice, beans, eggs, and poultry) in the free trade zones, and on fuel for unionized
public transportation and the transportation o f goods. These measures had high fiscal costs and
undermined macroeconomic stability. The cost o f energy subsidies almost doubled from 1.7
percent o f GDP in 2007 to an estimated 3 percent in 2008, primarily as a result o f the spike in

10.

2

FY10-I3 Country Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Republic

August 12, 2009

international o i l prices. Although no precise measure i s available, energy transfers appear to have
been regressive and did not benefit the most vulnerable groups because wealthier people
consume more fuel.

11.
Although public-debt-to-GDP reached a high o f 49.3 percent o f GDP in 2003
following the banking crisis, this ratio has since declined significantly. B y 2008, it was down
to 32.5 percent, because o f the 2005 restructuring o f sovereign external debt, rapid recent GDP
growth, falling real interest rates, and real exchange rate appreciation. Better basic fiscal
management only played a modest role. In addition to a lower debt level, the structure o f public
debt has improved with lengthening maturities (especially for the certificates o f the Central
Bank) and a higher share o f fixed interest rate debt. The Government’s target for the debt to GDP
ratio is 25 percent b y 201 5, and this seemed readily attainable until the global economic crisis.
12.
Inflation declined from 51.5 percent in 2004 to 7.4 percent in 2007 and 8.3 percent in
2008. In the aftermath o f the 2003 banking crisis, inflation was driven by excess liquidity
following the banking collapse and subsequent bailout, and was exacerbated b y the peso’s
depreciation due to currency substitution. Prudent monetary policy brought the rapid return to
single-digit inflation. In contrast with this earlier period, external conditions have been more
important for recent inflation. Since late 2007, when international price inflation accelerated,
prices in the DR increased more rapidly than the regional average. Besides the pass-through from
international prices, the increase in domestic food prices was also related to the tropical storms
Noel and Olga that hit the country at the end o f 2007.
13.
Market capital inflows in 2003 to mid 2008 were sufficient to finance the current
account deficit, which has widened recently, International reserves have improved relative
to the period o f the banking crisis and the exchange rate has been fairly stable since early
2005. The current account deficit has widened considerably since 2006 because o f the
combination o f slowing export growth and rising import bills. Real export growth averaged only
around 3 percent between 2003 and 2008, mainly due to declining net exports o f the Free Trade
Zones (FTZ). Other exports have become more diversified, as non-traditional products and
tourism services have substituted for textiles and other traditional exports. Imports grew rapidly
in 2006-07 and early 2008, due to booming investment and consumption demand, along with
high international prices. The DR remains heavily dependent on energy imports: o i l imports
equaled about ten percent o f GDP in 2007. Assuming fixed imported quantities, a decline o f
US$lO in the average price o f a barrel o f oil saves about U S 4 8 0 million in the import bill.
14,
After the domestic financial crisis in 2003, foreign direct investment (FDI) made a
robust recovery. Inflows went primarily to the tourism, communications, commercial, and real
estate sectors, FDI was the most significant component o f the capital account once again in
2008, reaching U S 2 . 9 billion and covering about three-quarters o f the current account deficit.
FDI and other capital inflows compensated for a larger current account deficit, and reserves
levels did not suffer. Strong remittance flows (estimated at around ten percent o f GDP in recent
years) have also been an important source o f foreign exchange - although they contracted
slightly in late 2008.

Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

15.
Growth projections have been revised downwards as a result of the ongoing
global economic crisis and the slowdown in the US economy. Government estimates
’ foresee a gradual slowdown to about 2.5 percent GDP growth in 2009, with a recovery to
about 3.5-4.5 percent by 2010. However, this scenario may be optimistic as recent data
point to a further deterioration o f global growth and trade. The Government i s working
on a less optimistic scenario which i s in line with the World Bank staff forecasts reported
in Table 1. A more realistic forecast for the DR i s about 0.5 percent growth in 2009 and,
conditional on an improved external environment, o f about 2.3 percent for 2010-to be
followed by a gradual return to the long term growth potential o f 5-6 percent in the outer
years. Preliminary data for the first quarter o f 2009 show growth o f 1.O percent; however,
this growth was achieved by the expansion o f non tradable services which have reached
capacity constraints and, given the slowdown in investment activity, may not sustain
growth going forward. Activities linked to external demand and investment contracted
significantly during first quarter o f 2009: mining was down 74 percent, FTZ
manufacturing 13 percent, hotels and restaurants (tourism services) 8 percent, and
construction 22 percent.

16.
The economy’s performance i s highly dependent on external economic
conditions. The country i s very open as imports plus exports equals 87 percent o f GDP
(data corresponding to 2007). It depends heavily on food and energy imports. The U.S. i s
i t s most important trading partner, i t s main source o f FDI (accounting for a third o f the
total), the predominant origin o f remittances, and a major source o f tourism revenues.
Consequently, the Dominican Republic growth cycle i s strongly correlated with that o f
the U S . World Bank staff estimates suggest that a 1 percent reduction in US growth
leads on average to a 0.25 percentage point reduction o f the DR’s growth, with a lag o f
about three quarters.

17.
External conditions also affect domestic inflation dynamics. Due to the
declines in the international prices o f oil and other commodities, and in contrast to the
inflation spike o f the first half o f 2008, inflation in the DR i s expected to be in the range
o f 5 and 7 percent for 2009-1 1.
Going forward, the external environment will probably have more negative
18.
than positive effects on the DR’s external balances. Although declining international
commodity prices will relieve pressure on import costs, the global economic slowdown
and lower demand from North America and Europe will reduce revenues from exports,
remittances, and tourism.

19.
While the Dominican Republic received large inflows of foreign capital
during 2008; lower global growth, tighter international liquidity conditions, and
greater risk aversion o f investors may substantially reduce capital inflows in the
near future. During the first part o f 2009, the significant reduction o f the value o f
imported commodities has counterbalanced the parallel decrease o f foreign exchange
inflows and, in recent months, the Dominican peso has maintained a stable course vis-avis the US dollar and other currencies. However, given i t s structurally large trade deficits,
the country has to rely heavily on capital inflows to balance i t s external accounts.
According to official sources, a large investment project in the mining sector i s in the
pipeline for 2009. If realized, this investment should help in weathering the global
5

FYIO-13 Count? Partnership Stratem for the Dominican ReDublic

August 12, 2009

environment. The degree of uncertainty around this investment i s limited given that the
2009 inflows are part of a much larger investment plan: across several years, the mining
investment plan amounts to about US$3.6 billion and US$700 million have already been
invested in 2008. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains: when compared with the
corresponding period of 2008, FDI in the first quarter o f 2009 contracted by 41 percent.

20.

T h e external financing needs for 2009 and future years are substantial but
they could b e met. The situation remains delicate: international liquidity i s s t i l l scarce
and borrowing costs for the D R are high; the country i s vulnerable to external price
shocks, and fiscal expenditures in excess o f what can be securely financed could create
additional pressure. Given the limited amount o f reserves and their current loose
monetary policy (adequate to counter the slowdown o f the economy), authorities are
aware o f the limits of their current macroeconomic policy stance and are monitoring
economic developments closely.

21.
Given i t s fiscal situation, the DR has little room for maneuver to counter the
international financial crisis and the global slowdown. For 2009, the Government, in
accordance with the I M F Post Program Monitoring mission o f November 2008, has
targeted an overall fiscal deficit o f 1.7 percent o f GDP, but the deficit w i l l most likely be
larger and in the range o f 2.5-3 percent o f GDP. This deficit i s consistent with: (a) slower
economic activity causing lower tax revenues, (b) forecasted lower international
commodity prices, (c) forthcoming debt servicing, and (d) the financing available from
international financial organizations. Maintaining fiscal discipline should create some
space to ease monetary policy. During the first months o f 2009, the Central Bank has
already reduced i t s policy rates four times; currently (June 2009) the policy rate
(overnight rate) i s at five percent, down from 9.5 percent at the end o f 2008. Additional
measures to increase liquidity in the economy include a lower legal reserve amount in
banks. This change in the macroeconomic policy mix should provide some
countercyclical stimulus, but the effects o f a looser monetary policy come with a lag and
private credit, after more than 15 months o f negative growth has just recently (June 2009)
shown some positive signs o f expansion. The other main direct consequence o f the more
flexible monetary policy has been the reduction o f market interest rates which decreased
from around 14 percent at the end o f 2009 to about ten percent by end o f March 2009.
Further reductions may be possible but external conditions may limit the policy o f
reducing interest rates, especially given the commitment o f the Central Bank to stability
o f the peso and control inflation (see also paragraph 20).

22.

As expected, given the contraction o f global and domestic economic activity,
fiscal revenues decreased in the first months o f 2009; this coupled w i t h a larger than
budgeted electricity sector deficit has created concerns about a fiscal financing gap.
The budget for 2009 was designed with the following assumptions (annual rates for
2009): (i)
real GDP growth o f 2.5 percent, (ii)inflation o f 5 to 6 percent, (iii)oil price o f
69.8 US$/barrel, and (iv) US GDP growth o f -0.6 percent. Under these assumptions the
overall deficit was projected at 1.7 percent o f GDP. However, the situation has
deteriorated and these initial assumptions may need to be revised. As shown in Table 2 ,
revenue flows for the first quarter o f 2009 are well below those o f the same period a year
earlier and below what authorities had expected. If current trends continue for the rest o f
the year, the gap in total revenues i s estimated to reach about US$400 million (Table 3).
On the expenditures side the downside scenario has a larger deficit for the electricity

sector. The Government budget for the electricity sector in 2009 includes about US$350
million for current expenditures and US$70 million for investment expenditures, totaling
about U S 4 2 0 million. The latest estimates put the electricity sector deficit in the range
o f US$550 to US$700 million.

23.
Expenditures have fallen in the first half o f 2009, notably in goods and
services and public investments (almost 50 percent reduction according to the data
reported in Table 2). This reduction in expenditures may have helped to avoid a cash
flow problem; however, i t may also act as a pro-cyclical fiscal cut which, in turn, may
further hamper economic growth. Financing sources have also changed; the 2009 budget
required about US$2 billion in financing (Table 3), to be covered b y domestic borrowing
(about US$500 million) and external borrowing from IFIs and bilateral institutions. The
external financing from PetroCaribe i s likely to fall short by an estimated US$65 million
due to lower than anticipated oil prices. The cumulative effect o f these changes amounts
to a fiscal financing gap o f about US$700 million for 2009.
The Government has taken some initial steps to fund its financing gap.
24.
Nonetheless, there i s short term uncertainty and medium term viability i s yet to be
ascertained. The Government’s plan consists o f (i)completion o f the sale o f public
assets; the Government has publicly announced that it has entered the final phase o f a
negotiation for the sale o f a refinery to the Government o f Venezuela for the price o f US$
130 million; (ii)implementation o f electricity sector reforms-which the Government
increase in
estimates to contain the electricity sector’s deficit within US$150 million; (iii)
the flows o f bilateral loans; authorities have mentioned a possible agreement with the
Government o f Colombia to finance purchases o f coal; and (iv) issuance o f sovereign
bonds for an amount o f up to US$1 billion, US$500 million to be placed in 2009 and the
rest in 2010. The Authorities have indicated that they will consider maturity in the range
of 5 to 10 years and that they expect interest rates in the range o f 10 to 15 percent. The
current yield for Dominican sovereign bonds i s o f about 11 percent. Latin American and
Caribbean countries have issued sovereign bonds in 2009 for a total o f about US$ 7
billion: Colombia (3 issuances in April and January for a total o f US$ 3 billion at 10
years, at an average interest rate o f 450 basis points above US treasury), Brazil (1
issuance in January for US$ 1 billion, at 10 years, at 370 basis points above UST),
Mexico (1 issuance in February for US$ 1.5 billion, at 5 years, at 425 basis points above
UST), Peru (1 issuance in March for US$ 1 billion, at 10 years, at 438 basis points above
UST) and Panama (1 issuance for US$ 323 million, at 6 years, at an interest rate o f 7.04
percent). Based on this data and according to Bank staff calculations (debt sustainability
analysis) issuing $1 billion in sovereign bonds at 14 per cent interest rate and with
maturity from 5 to 10 years i s not destabilizing

25.
Table 3 indicates that should the plan envisaged b y the Government be
implemented successfully-an issue to be determined-the currently projected financing
gap could be turned into surplus. According to the authorities, any resulting surplus
would be used to reduce financial liabilities.
26.
I n terms o f long term sustainability, the viability o f the plan to cover the
fiscal financing gap, and in particular the issuance o f sovereign bonds will depend
on (i) future growth, (ii)further improvements in the quality and control of public
spending, and (iii) implementation o f a multi-year budget and macroeconomic
framework Debt sustainability would not be seriously compromised by the issuing o f

US$1 billion bonds (roughly two percent o f GDP), as long as this i s a one-off operation
and the public finances go back to generate a reasonable primary surplus. The public debt
to GDP ratio i s about 33 percent. If authorities place two percent in bonds, this ratio will
go up to 35 -37 percent but it should s t i l l be sustainable (see paragraph 28). Due to
increases in future interest payments, further reduction o f poorly targeted subsidies
should become even more important. To sustain i t s social and development program
under these circumstances, the Government i s taking appropriate steps to improve the
quality o f public expenditures. The adoption o f a multi-year formulation o f monetary and
fiscal policy i s also being pursued as required by the National Development Strategy.

I n summary, declining revenues, a higher energy sector deficit, and declining
funding from PetroCaribe imply a risky situation. The Government understands these
risks and recognizes that the control and quality o f spending i s a key tool to prevent a
hard landing. However, at least in the recent past, improving the quality o f spending has
been a challenge.

28.

Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the DR public debt appears to
be on a sustainable path. At about 34 percent in 2008, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio i s
not high by regional standards, but the Government aims to continue on a path to bring
debt back to pre-2003 crisis levels in the medium run. The DSA assumes that, the public
debt to GDP ratio will not be reduced in 2009, a year during which the fiscal stance will
be counterbalancing, in a measured manner, the global slowdown. After 2010, however,
when global external conditions are projected to improve, the Government should be able
to continue reducing the debt ratio towards the 25 percent goal by generating primary
surpluses o f close to 1.O percent o f GDP.
In the medium term, external debt will probably decline as a share o f GDP,
29.
because the current account should improve as a result o f (a) lower international prices,
(b) slower economic activity reducing demand for imports, (c) prudent macroeconomic
policies and (d) a stable real exchange rate. Financing from IFIs and FDI should be
sufficient to cover the forecasted current account deficit in the next few years.'

The domestic financial system i s vulnerable to the possibility o f further
30.
deterioration in the domestic o r international environment. The sector was resilient in
2008, in the face o f rising interest rates from a restrictive monetary policy. With low
international reserves, a large fiscal deficit and very high peso interest rates, however, the
authorities have little room to dampen the impact o f the crisis on the country's productive
and financial sectors.
'

The banking system's low-cost funding base does not face a significant threat
3 1,
o f sudden deposit withdrawals, because deposits are mostly small and domestic.
However, if the central bank were forced to raise interest rates dramatically in response to
an unexpected deterioration in the balance o f payments, the banking system could
experience major credit losses and capital flight that would make i t s position
unsustainable. Although there i s no real policy remedy or Central Bank management
decision that could significantly change this outcome, improving the monitoring and
regulation o f banks could reduce the likelihood o f financial sector problems and would
give the authorities time to prepare and react.
Government authorities are engaged in a dialogue with the IMF on the
32,
medium-term macroeconomic situation. An IMF mission was in the country the week
of July 27 working with high ranking Government counterparts to assess the current
macroeconomic situation and explore the possibilities o f IMF support to the country.

33.
Two macroeconomic scenarios can be envisaged for medium-term. A first
scenario i s that a positive outcome o f the dialogue mentioned in the above paragraph will
result into a multiyear support program o f the IMF which will help the country reduce the
short-term macroeconomic risks. A second scenario will be one where the authorities will
not have negotiated a program with the IMF, but they will s t i l l have been able to secure
enough financing to cover their fiscal and external needs and thus achieved a medium
term sustainable macro balance. In both cases the macro situation will be adequate for the
World Bank to support the implementation o f the Government program through this

' An updated DSA will be provided by staff before Board presentation.

proposed CPS, but the emphasis o f the support o f the CPS and the instruments through
which this will be implemented will have to be adapted to the specific case.2
I n summary, on the one hand, the country i s facing a downturn and serious
34.
short-term risks - including facing liquidity constraints to balance its fiscal and
external accounts - associated with the difficult global environment. I t s small open
economy, high dependency on commodity imports and strong economic l i n k s with the
US make the country particularly vulnerable to a prolonged global recession and swings
in commodity prices. Under these circumstances, a challenge for the authorities will
consist o f securing financing to cover their fiscal and external needs and that this
additional debt will not compromise the medium term macro framework. On the other
hand, the DR has recorded growth rates well above the regional average and, as in
the recent case o f the banking crisis o f 2003, has been able to quickly regain sustained
economic expansion after a downturn. In the recent period, it has been able to greatly
reduce i t s debt-to-GDP ratio, to contain inflation, to attract exceptional level o f FDI flows
and to maintain a stable currency.

GOVERNANCE
AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS: CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES

35.
While progress was made during the last 5 years, the governance
environment in the DR i s complex and singled out by many as one o f the country’s
main overarching obstacles to achieving sustainable, equitable and inclusive growth.
As explained in greater detail in Annex 7 , the DR has made good progress in passing
important reforms that redefine the role o f the institutions involved in the planning and
budgeting process (e.g. 2006 Organic L a w on the Public Sector Budget, 2006 Creation o f
State Secretariats for Treasury and Economy, Planning and Development, 2007 Financial
Administration System o f the State Law, 2006 Public Credit Law, 2006 Planning and
Investment Law, 2006 Government Procurement and Contracting Law, 2007
Establishment o f the Internal Control System Law).
However, the country i s
characterized b y a strong Presidential system with few checks and balances on the
executive and where critical reforms are being implemented to strengthen the public
financial management framework. Congress and the Supreme Audit Institution have
limited technical capacity to play their oversight function, media scrutiny i s s t i l l weak,
independence o f the judiciary could be strengthened, and civil society (although
increasingly active) has limited power to hold the government accountable.
The limited capacity of public institutions to produce tangible results - added
36.
to a public perception of corruption, in public institutions - may contribute to low
levels of trust in Government. While progress has been made, especially in the design
of a new institutional architecture for the State, implementation o f these reforms i s s t i l l
limited and there are few related tangible benefits for the population. The implementation
of many o f these laws has been slow and seems to depend very much on the specific
interest o f the concerned Ministry. This situation and a perception by many citizens o f
corruption and impunity may be further eroding an already-low trust in Government,
This assessment will need to be confirmed closer to the Board date with particular reference to the
implementation results o f the authorities’ plan to close the financing gap - a key element in this judgment.

11

which has negative implications for tax collection rates and the effectiveness o f
Government actions.
37.
P r i o r to 2006, public financial management (PFM) did not adequately
support the objectives o f aggregate fiscal discipline, efficient resource allocation o r
operational efficiency, but considerable progress i s now apparent in this area.
Budgeted revenue and expenditure differed considerably from outturns, with the
President exercising a high degree o f discretion over spending, while expenditure control
and procurement systems were inadequate, fragmented and enforcement was weak.
Recognizing these weaknesses, the DR has undertaken P F M reforms, which inter alia
have strengthened the legal and institutional framework for PFM. These have included
steps to limit Presidential discretionary spending, and enforcing the implementation o f a
financial management information system (SIGEF) - now backed by the law. Other steps
have been taken to consolidate budget formulation and treasury management in the
Ministry o f Finance, and the creation o f a new Ministry o f Economy, Planning and
Development to improve capital budgeting.
38.
Another important challenge - and one which i s already receiving
substantial Government attention - i s improving the quality o f public expenditure.
The Secretary o f Economy and Planning (SEEPyD) has published a strategic plan to
gradually introduce performance-informed budgeting techniques (Plan Estrate'gico
Institucional, 2008-20 12, Secretaria de Estado de Economia Planificacion y Desarrollo:
http://www.pro-reforma.gov.do). This includes the introduction o f a national investment
system (Sistema Nacional de Inversion Publica - SNIP) designed to enforce more
rigorous program planning, monitoring and evaluation standards (Sistema Nacional de
PlaniJicacidn, Nuevo Marco Institucional, Secretaria de Estado de Economia
Planificacion y Desarrollo: http://www.pro-reforma.gov,do). In addition, 'Results
Agreements', which set out strategic plans, objectives and identify performance
measuredtargets will be agreed with four priority Ministries during 2009.
39.
S E E P y D has organized a taskforce to improve governance indicators, in close
collaboration with the Bank and the USAID. Among other indicators, this group i s
paying special attention to corruption indexes as they affect the chances o f the Dominican
Republic to participate in the Millennium Challenge Account program sponsored b y the
US Government.

D.

POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND THE MDGS

40.
T h e Dominican Republic's sustained decade-long economic growth achieved
only a limited reduction in poverty rates. According to the most recent data, b y
October 2006, moderate income poverty had declined by 7 percentage points and extreme
poverty b y 3 percentage points. Inequality in the DR i s high, with a Gini coefficient o f
0.483 (based 'on 2007 household per-capita income). As shown in Figure 1, poverty
remains well above the pre-crisis level-36 o f every 100 Dominicans live in poverty, o f
which 13 in 100 live in extreme poverty. While some progress was made in reducing
poverty in urban areas, rural poverty showed virtually no decline, reflecting the high level
o f inequality and the strong rural-urban divide. For 2006, moderate poverty and extreme
poverty in urban areas was 29 per cent and 8 per cent compared to 50.3 per cent and 22
per cent in rural areas.

41.
I n 2007, the Dominican Republic spent about 8.1 p e r cent o f i t s GDP on
human development indicators, far below regional averages. Social expenditure in
the DR tends to be pro-cyclical (Figure 1). For certain specific spending categories, such
as health, the 2003 crisis and subsequent cuts were equivalent to erasing six years o f
cumulative progress. Figure 1 also shows that crises can be particularly damaging in
terms o f their longer-term poverty effects.

Access to public social services remains a challenge for many Dominicans especially poor households - and the quality o f education and health i s well below
comparable countries in the region. The DR has lower levels o f primary and secondary
school enrollment when compared to the LCR average (Table 4). The education sector i s
characterized by high repetition rates, low retention, and completion rates. As a result, the
DR lags behind in average years o f education, despite a high number o f years spent in
schools. Improving quality o f primary education and access/quality o f secondary
education will mean spending more money, not just becoming more efficient with
existing spending. However, the DR does better than the average o f lower middle income
countries with respect to child and infant mortality rates and water and sanitation. Recent
developments in the health sector may provide good opportunities for increasing public
investment - especially for the poor - strengthening accountability mechanisms, and
improving the quality o f sector expenditures. The sector could benefit from improving
strategic purchasing for health care services and procurement o f pharmaceuticals,
strengthening the management capacity o f decentralized public sector health care
providers networks, and consolidating progress made in the capacity o f the Ministry o f
Health for strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation to better exercise i t s stewardship
role over the health sector.

Moreover, while some pro-poor programs are showing good results, social
safety nets continue to be pro-cyclical making it difficult to protect the poor during
periodic economic downturns. Solidaridad - a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT)
program - has made progress in targeting the poor and has demonstrated value added for
providing poor families with targeted subsidies. The program needs to continue
strengthening its targeting mechanisms, expand coverage, ensure additional levels o f
transparency, and put sound monitoring and evaluation schemes in place. Similarly, the
education and health sector need to strengthen their own contribution to the goals o f the
program in terms o f the supply o f adequate services and monitoring o f co-responsibility.

44.
I n social protection, key pending challenges and areas of reform will need to
be addressed, if the Government’s social assistance response to the crisis i s to be
more inclusive, effective, efficient and transparent. First, the amount and coverage o f
existing and new safety nets may be insufficient to mitigate the impact o f the crisis on the
poorest and vulnerable and second, the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency o f the
social assistance system can be improved. Recent process evaluations from the IDB and
UNDP point to a program which i s at risk o f losing i t s focus as a result o f multiple
demands suggesting the need to further revamp Solidaridad. The program needs a
strategic redefinition o f goals, priorities and a full process o f de-concentration (by
providing more autonomy and strengthening coordination mechanisms to service
providers at lower levels) to work more effectively at local level.

Gender. Problems remain in the inequitable access of men and women to
45.
health, education, and labor market participation. Even though the country has
adopted a series o f legal and institutional measures aimed at improving the legal status o f
women in terms o f labor law, civil law and land reform, as well as protection from
domestic violence by special provisions in the criminal law, active programs to enforce
and promote these regulations are still very much needed. Much remains to be done in
terms o f enhancement o f reproductive and maternal health, especially for young women,
as well as more intensive campaigns to prevent and reduce the incidence o f HIV, for both
sexes. Special programs are needed to promote the permanence at school o f boys and
girls from poor households so that they escape the vicious circle o f early adoption o f

adult activities, scant accumulation o f human capital, and insufficient employment
opportunities and poverty.
Broadening the current menu of labor-based interventions i s necessary with
46.
a strong focus on vulnerable youth. The DR has one o f the most successful youth
employment training programs in the region, but more needs to be done. Active labor
market responses for vulnerable groups who currently are not targeted are needed
(current programs only target youth), as well as the improvement o f intermediation

generation for low-skilled workers (mostly in the informal economy) who may be hit by
the crisis need to be explored. These actions should include a strong emphasis on
targeting the youth Unemployment o f those 16 to 24 years old i s 30 per cent compared

The DR has made substantial progress in meeting the MDGs, particularly
during the high growth years since 2000. However, the pace o f future progress
depends directly on future growth and the willingness and ability o f the Government to
effectively direct resources to address social issues. MDG projections (Table 5) indicate
that the country w i l l probably be able to halve the number o f people living under US$1
PPP per day, but it i s unlikely that poverty, as defined by the national poverty line, w i l l
also be reduced in half. I t i s also unlikely that the country w i l l be able to achieve all
MDGs simultaneously because it would require a sweeping increase in health and
education expenditures beyond the current trends in these variables (base scenario). An
alternative scenario that assumes a rise in total health expenditures from 1 per cent o f
GDP in 2004 to 5.3 percent o f GDP in 2015 would render results very close to the goals
in both education and heath, but i t s impact on poverty and economic growth w i l l depend
on how the surge in social expenditures i s financed.

DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

49,
In addition to the macroeconomic, governance, and poverty and inequality
challenges discussed above, the DR faces other significant development challenges.
Strengthened financial sector supervision and regulation and what appears
50.
at present to be a well capitalized and profitable banking sector are notable
achievements. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) are at modest levels, and are adequately
provisioned. Twenty eight application norms o f the Monetary and Financial Law (MFL)
have been elaborated and approved. However, important supervisory and regulatory

16

FYI 0-1 3 Country Partnership Stratew-for the Dominican Republic

August 12, 2009

issues s t i l l need to be addressed, including the approval o f the amendments to the MFL
that will provide a basis for strengthening the supervision o f off-shore banking and
making operational the recently-approved norm on consolidated supervision. The FSAP
Progress Report (February 2009) provides a complete analysis o f the financial sector.

The energy sector continues to pose important challenges to fiscal
51.
sustainability and competitiveness. While losses declined between 2004 and 2008 and
the cash recovery index o f distribution companies improved from 45 percent to 64
percent over the same period, key aspects o f the power sector deteriorated. Tariffs were
frozen in September 2006 and tariff increases were implemented in June and July 2009
amounting to 12.5 percent. However, as o i l prices rose significantly, the gap between the
cost o f electricity and what utilities collected grew from US$600 million in 2006 to over
US$1.3 billion in 2008 (3 percent o f GDP). In 2008, Government transferred US$85
million per month to electricity utilities to cover the gap between bill collection and
generation costs. However, as a result o f the combination o f (i)the spike in o i l prices, (ii)
a freeze in tariffs, and (iii)high levels o f losses (Figure 2), and (iv) the inefficiencies in
operational levels o f the distribution companies in the sector (Figure 3), the Government
had accumulated arrears to generators for a total deficit o f US$440 million at end
December 2008. Generators in turn cut production, causing massive blackouts throughout
the country. A combination o f loans from the IDB, OPEC, and the World Bank for
US$120 million i s expected to help improve energy distribution in the country. Working
jointly with the Bank, IFC will support private sector investment.

52.
Looking forward, recently, progress has been made in implementing a series
of key reforms in the context of a high-level dialogue with the President, the IDB
and the World Bank. In addition to the adjustment in tariffs, the regionally defined
subsidy (PRA) was eliminated and the Government i s creating a targeted subsidy for the
poor. However, challenges remain. Only 38 per cent o f the consumers are “typical”
payers - while 62 per cent o f them either are heavily subsidized or use electricity without
paying for it. Action i s needed in key areas, notably to ensure the financial sustainability
o f all agents in the power chain - from generation to distribution - by: (i)
rationalizing
the tariff scheme to promote efficiency, improving cost recovery, and providing revenues
to finance investments; (ii)consolidating and deepening loss reduction and efficiency
gains in distribution companies; and (iii)
promoting investment in lower cost generation
in order to reduce oil dependency. Improving the investment climate and the DR’s ability
to attract new investments w i l l be important. A comprehensive action plan to reform the
electricity sector in the DR i s currently being discussed with Government counterparts.
tariffs, (ii)subsidies, (iii)loses, (iv) utilities
This plan includes actions in seven areas: (i)
efficiency, (v) institutional design to improve governance o f the sector, (vi) a new
payment mechanism for the country’s electricity bill (escrow mechanism) to increase
levels o f transparency, and (vii) supply-side investments.

53:
The fiscal position o f the Government has suffered for years from the cost o f
subsidies to the energy sector, and the policies supported by a Public Finance and
Social Sectors DPL will help reduce those costs. Electricity subsidies in recent years
took five-to-ten percent o f public spending (close to 3 percent o f GDP), and the latest
reforms w i l l reduce the cost by half. Subsidies for liquid gas were costing over 0.6
percent o f GDP, and projected down to 0.2 percent in 2009 with the latest reforms.
Specifically, this loan supports measures in electricity tariffs and subsidies aiming at
18

FYIO-13 Countw Partnership Stratepv for the Dominican Republic

August 12, 2009

reducing the size o f the deficit o f the electricity sector by supporting four key actions: (i)
increase tariffs to reduce the gap between retail prices and the current costs o f service; (ii)
simplify the tariff structure; (iii)
reduce the consumption threshold for tariff subsidy; and
(iv) return to a flexible tariff system in which prices reflect changing costs. An increase in
tariffs o f around 12.5 percent accompanied by the actions proposed in terms o f
simplification o f tariff blocks and reduction in the consumption threshold for tariff
subsidy, should generate additional revenues for system o f around US$ 120 million a
year (some US$60 million for the second half o f 2009). In addition, the improvement in
the Cash Recovery Index (CRI) represents US$ 15 million for each point in C R I increase.
Hence, 3 additional C R I points before the end o f the year, would result in a reduction o f
the deficit o f about US$45 million. In addition, this D P L supports reforms to
administration o f internal revenues (including the l i n k s with Customs) will also have a
modest positive impact on the fiscal picture, although in the short term this i s being
overwhelmed b y the decline in overall taxable activity, due to the economic crisis. Over
the medium term the positive effect will show, with a rise both in revenue as a share o f
GDP and in absolute revenues, as improved administrative efficiency facilitates
economic growth.

54.
Improving trade facilitation and logistics i s another key challenge if the DR i s
to take full advantage o f the recent DR-CAFTA agreement and improve the
country’s overall competitiveness. Logistics perception indices demonstrate that DR
falls behind many Caribbean and Central American countries in terms o f customs,
infrastructure, ease o f entry and monitoring. Economic analysis confirms the reality o f
this perception. A comparative analysis has shown that given i t s level o f economic
development, DR performs below i t s expected performance level in terms o f logistics (in
“Connecting to Compete” - Jean-Francois Arvis et al, The World Bank, 2007). This
translates into high logistics costs, larger inventories, a higher percentage o f goods that
do not arrive at their destined markets and lower overall connectivity. This, in turn, leads
to price distortion o f goods and shipping costs and ultimately affects the demand for
goods.

55.
The Dominican Republic i s considered a hotspot for natural disasters and
one o f the top high-risk countries in the world, ranking second in terms o f
vulnerability o f i t s GDP to three or more hazards (96.5 percent o f the country’s GDP i s
located in areas at risk. The DR i s also among the top five countries at risk in terms o f
population exposed to three or more hazards: 71,l percent o f the population lives in areas
o f high risk3.I t s geographic location, in the center o f the Antillean archipelago below the
Tropic o f Cancer, places i t in the pathway o f hydro meteorological phenomena
(hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical depressions) that sweep across the Atlantic Ocean
and Caribbean Sea. Furthermore, the country i s exposed to earthquakes, landslides,
flooding (particularly in the low-lying areas o f the country) drought, and tidal waves on
the coast. While the Dominican Republic i s advancing towards a proactive disaster risk
management (DRh4). approach, further efforts are needed to improve: coordination and
capacity; disaster prevention and mitigation investments; information-sharing among
responsible agencies; and harmonization o f methodologies and approaches used for local
disaster risk assessments and management plans.
World Bank, Natural Disaster Hotspots, 2005, Table 7.3: Countries at Relatively High Economic Risk
from Multiple Hazards, p. 89.).

56.
Climate change i s increasing vulnerability, affecting one o f the country’s
main engines for growth. The Dominican Republic’s relatively weak watershed
management contributes to this exposure and amplifies the potential damages, The
tourism industry has already left a large environmental footprint, mostly on coastal
ecosystems and aquifers, through dumping o f untreated waste water and solid waste, over
exploitation o f groundwater, destruction o f forest cover, and overfishing o f coral and
marine species. These unsustainable practices reduce the response capacity o f ecosystems
to anticipated impacts from climate change. Given i t s large dependency on tourism and
the precarious living conditions o f i t s rural population, the DR would benefit from having
a sound strategy to deal with these issues.
57.
The contribution o f agriculture, the fourth-largest sector, has fallen in the
current decade to 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2006, down from 13.3 percent o f GDP in
1993. Since the agricultural sector employs over 15 percent o f the economically active
population, the decline in production has affected small farmers and rural workers’
income and i s considered one o f the structural causes o f rural poverty. Traditional
agriculture has been declining since the early 1980s, hampered b y high real interest rates,
price controls, underinvestment, the subsidised sale by the Government o f imported
agricultural and livestock products, and foreign competition. Strengthening
competitiveness i s a priority for the sector.

THEDOMINICANREPUBLIC
NATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY

58.
The Government i s preparing a National Development Strategy for which it
convened a broad-based national dialogue, led b y SEEPyD with a variety o f actors from
civil society, the private sector and the political spectrum. The process for the definition
o f this Strategy was structured in two phases. The first phase discussed proposals
targeting short-term issues with emphasis on the economy, social services, public
administration, and institutional strengthening. The discussions were organized in six
thematic tables. The second phase o f this process has produced a 20-year framework to
be presented to Congress in September 2009. This includes in-depth analysis o f technical
proposals, the organization o f a series o f thematic workshops with key stakeholders, and
the discussion o f policy notes to be presented by international organizations, including
the World Bank. The National Development Strategy includes 32 main development
areas that can be grouped in the following 5 general pillars: (i)social development, (ii)
competitiveness and productive development, (iii) growth and sustainability, (iv)
institutional development, and (v) territorial development and the environment. A
detailed table describing the pillars, main themes, and strategic objectives o f the National
Development Strategy i s included in Annex 5.
59.
The Government strategy also includes 4 horizontal dimensions mainstreamed
across all other pillars: (i)gender equity, (ii)environmental sustainability and climate
change, (iii)
democratic governance, and (iv) knowledge and communications.

111. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
60.
The FY05-FY09 CAS had an “overarching focus on improving governance
and strengthening institutions” to help restore confidence in the country and restore
growth. The IBRD lending program was US$260 million in the base case (plus US$15
million from GEF, not including a Carbon Finance proposal). Through FY08, the Bank
had lent US$166.4 million, and the composition o f the lending differed significantly from
that proposed in the CAS. Planned and actual CAS lending for FY06-FY09 and detailed
information about this period i s included in the CAS Completion Report (Annex 4). I F C
committed a total o f U S 1 9 9 million, and secured an additional mobilization o f US$99
million from commercial banks and an official export finance agency (Table 6). These
investments supported 12 projects; as o f M a y 3 1, 2009, IFC’s outstanding and committed
portfolio stands at US$182 million and US$183 million respectively. MIGA’s exposure
in the Dominican Republic fell slightly over the CAS period (from US$157.3 million in
FY06 to US$124.7 million currently). Since FY06, MIGA has been guaranteeing the
Santo Domingo-Samana toll road and exploring other projects in the transportation sector
which have yet to materialize.

LESSONS
FROM THE FY06-FY09 CAS AND STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION

61.
Several lessons may be derived from the Bank’s engagement in the DR, notably
from the CAS Completion Report, the Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR),
the consultative process with civil society and private sector leaders, and the ongoing
dialogue with other international development agencies. W h i l e Annex 3 presents a
broader analysis o f these lessons, the following key messages emerge.
60.
The lessons that emerge from the CAS Completion Report include the need to:
(i)focus on a few key sectors where there i s potential for success and where Bank advice
i s appreciated; (ii)set realistic and measurable objectives and targets; (iii)focus public
sector reform on maintaining accountability and transparency in Government operations,
including budget formulation and execution, and increasing the voice o f civil society; (iv)
adopt a comprehensive approach and include political economy dimensions when dealing
with the energy sector, (v) use ESW to focus on intractable problems like corruption,
drugs, money laundering, crime and violence, and public sector reform; (vi) conduct
ESW cooperatively with partners in country, so as to build ownership and local capacity,
(vii) strengthen civil society capacity to build a constituency for reforms and strengthen
the Bank engagement with Congress to deal with complex development challenges in the
country; and (viii) strengthen donor coordination by mapping donor’s interventions and
priority areas as well as aligning efforts for policy reform. During this period the
Government has particularly recognized Bank support in the following areas: (i)the role
played b y the Bank during the 2003 financial crisis and in the implementation o f the
Public Information Law and, (ii)the support given to Government in the preparation o f
21

FYIO-13 Country Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Republic

Aupust 12, 2009

the development strategy through the delivery o f 9 policy notes and the identification and
training on methodologies for prioritizing policy options.
61.
In February 2008, the Bank and the Government engaged in a joint (CPPR). This
exercise highlighted clearly implementation issues, such as delays in effectiveness and
disbursement. The CPPR also identified ways to address issues related to investment
operations. Specifically, a taskforce was created comprising representatives o f Finance,
Economy and Planning, the Bank - and as needed - from individual executing agencies.
This taskforce i s now mapping both Government and Bank procedures and w i l l propose
recommendations to streamline these procedures where possible. The group i s also
exploring ways to increase the technical capacity o f project implementation units and to
reduce personnel turnover. Looking forward, given their strategic value in the context o f
the new CPS, the next CPPR w i l l incorporate A A A as part o f the review.
62.
A series o f consultations w i t h civil society on the CPS took place in the DR, in
January 2009. Over 200 organizations participated in 4 country-wide consultations that
were held in La Romana, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Barahona. The main messages
emerging from these consultations include: (i)civil society organizations recognized the
value added o f the Bank in the DR as a strategic partner for development; (ii)strong
interest in partnering with the Bank; (iii)shared understanding o f the current
development challenges to be addressed in the next 4 years. In addition a Client Survey
was administered to 300 key stakeholders in the DR in early 2009. I t s results point to the
need to continue the Bank’s focus on poverty reduction and to strengthen the Bank’s
focus on education and governance.
63.
Finally, a special coordination meeting with other international development
agencies operating in the D R was held in November, 2008. Most participants agreed that
donor actions in the D R should be guided by the need to strengthen institutions and
improve governance in the country given the importance o f these areas in addressing the
country’s development challenges. At a follow up meeting held in February 2009, over
15 agencies engaged in an exercise to identify the most relevant policy reforms and
conduct a harmonization exercise (Annex 8).

WORLDBANKGROUPASSISTANCE
STRATEGY
PROPOSED

World Bank Group Assistance Strategy Overview

64.
T h e strategic focus of this C P S i s derived f r o m the National Development
Strategy and complements the w o r k o f other development agencies in the country as
the CPS cannot address a l l development challenges included in the Government strategy.
Important issues such as climate change and the environment are included as part o f the
CPS. Annex 8 presents a table resulting from a donor harmonization exercise led by the
World Bank in the DR.
65.
Uncertainties related to the international financial crisis require a flexible
approach. The proposed program has some built-in flexibility to allow the Bank and
Government to make adjustments as the economic, political, and social environment
evolves. Should the Government’s reform program stall, macroeconomic conditions
deteriorate significantly, or the Bank fail to secure a credible policy matrix to underpin
budgetary support lending, the Bank would revisit the balance between investment and
22

FYI 0-13 Country Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Remblic

August 12, 2009

policy-based lending. WBG synergies w i l l enhance this flexible approach allowing for
the use o f diverse instruments.
66.
The new strategy places a stronger emphasis on strengthening social cohesion
and improving access and quality of social services. Given that growth has not
resulted in commensurate gains on the social front, the new CPS pays special attention to
increasing the human capital o f the poor and facilitates their access to finance and basic
services - both as a mitigation factor during the crisis and as a medium-term strategic
investment for addressing development challenges in the country. The previous CAS
showed that having strong social safety nets in place i s critical for mitigating the negative
effects o f a crisis, as witnessed during the 2003 financial crisis. In addition, the new CPS
w i l l support the country in generating more inclusive growth, that can translate into lower
levels o f poverty and inequality. Finally, special attention w i l l be given to gender issues,
by including this dimension in lending operations, AAA, and policy dialogue at all levels.

67.

Based on lessons from the previous period, the new CPS will tackle
governance and institutional development issues from the “Quality and Efficiency of
Public Expenditures” angle. The approach o f the previous CAS with respect to
governance issues yielded mixed results. Given the progress made in the design and
implementation o f a new institutional model for planning and budgeting, clear entry
points now exist to address governance issues. Specifically, the new CPS will support
SEEPyD, the Secretary o f Finance, selected spending ministries and Congress on issues
related to quality and efficiency o f public expenditures. The Bank i s already supporting
the Government on performance informed budgeting, providing technical assistance to
the Ministries o f Education and Health on results-based management, and strengthening
Congress’s oversight capacity on budget execution. Civil society and other donors have
expressed strong demand for the Bank’s support to this agenda, which in turn may help
address underlying governance issues.

68.

Past Bank engagement in the energy sector in the DR highlights the need to
do things differently. Recent efforts have not improved the sector’s financial
sustainability, due principally to the confluence o f an unfavorable external environment
and o f Government’s failure to fully reflect higher generation costs in retail tariffs and to
further reduce losses. Additional efforts are needed to consolidate the modest gains
achieved during the last CAS period and launch reforms which w i l l put the sector on a
sound footing and foster more rapid economic growth and greater competitiveness. The
new CPS supports a new joint Bank/IFC approach to the energy sector by (i)
conducting
an analysis o f lessons from energy sector reform over the past period (including the
political economy dynamics), and (ii)supporting additional reforms in the sector. Three
prongs will guide the Bank Group’s work: (a) an intensive engagement with stakeholders
to establish a new “energy equation”, (b) a comprehensive approach to energy sector
reform, and (c) support o f private sector investments. In addition, special attention will
be given to reducing external vulnerability, access to electricity by the poor, and the
development o f a clean energy matrix.

69.
The DR and the Bank Group have long maintained a close partnership, but
the traditional modalities o f engagement employed so far have yielded only mixed
results - suggesting the need for new approaches. Rather than having a number o f
stand-alone activities, the proposed strategy would be based on a proprammatic approach
that will provide continuity and direction to the Government reform agenda. This will
23

FYI 0-13 Countrv PartnershtD Stratem-for the Dominican Republic

August 12, 2009

include a combination o f investment and policy-based lending, and a strong emphasis on
analytical work - both in terms o f ESW and Non-Lending Technical Assistance
(NLTAs).
While policy based lending w i l l support the country’s continuing
implementation o f the reform agenda and provide the Government with liquidity during
the international financial crisis, a combination o f investment lending and AAA will help
strengthen capacity to addressing development issues in the country. These A A A
products are included as activities to support the four strategic objectives o f the CPS.
Annex 6 presents a comprehensive l i s t o f the identified AAA for each o f the strategic
objectives o f the proposed CPS and their existing and potential sources o f funding. While
experience in the DR shows that a more programmatic approach towards policy-based
lending and knowledge sharing i s needed, experience in the region shows that investing
in a strong knowledge agenda i s necessary for sustaining innovation and making policybased lending more effective. B y providing a more flexible approach and investing
heavily in capacity building o f Government counterparts, this strategy w i l l help avoid the
identified “bottlenecks” in terms o f effectiveness and disbursement delays.
IFC’s strategy during the upcoming CPS period will be two-fold:

70.
0

Priority areas will be the underserved segments o f the market, the ones having the
highest impact on the bottom o f the pyramid. Reaching out to Microenterprises
and SMEs will be a key objective. Implied areas o f intervention will include
access to finance (trade, microfinance and SMEs), improving the business
environment (Doing Business Reform, Corporate Governance), access to basic
infrastructure, and sustainable tourism development. Additional resources w i l l
support opportunities arising in other growth and income generating sectors
(agribusiness, general manufacturing, and so on.) when leading to sustainable
private sector investment.

0

Responding to the current financial crisis, IFC w i l l place a particular focus on
existing clients and shorter term financing (notably trade financing) and w i l l keep
a particular attention to priority areas (microfinance, SMEs, and infrastructure
services). The concern w i l l be to maintain the latest development gains among
the underserved.

71,
Within the above strategic framework, IFC investment and advisory actions are
expected to include climate change mitigation (e.g. energy efficiency and renewable
energy), raising sustainability standards (environment, social, and corporate governance),
and linkages (e.g. SMEs, and so on).
Strategic Objectives and Results Areas
World Bank Group Assistance Strategy Overview

72.
The main objective o f the Country Partnership Strategy for the D R for FY10FYI3 i s to support the country in reducing i t s vulnerability to internal and external
factors while producing results for i t s citizens. Among the main sources o f vulnerability
are: (i)a difficult fiscal situation now worsened by the global economic financial crisis;
(ii)extremely high levels o f poverty and inequality and limited capacity to implement
counter-cyclical social policies; (iii)
competitiveness challenges deriving mainly from an
inefficient energy sector and low skills levels; and (iv) the negative implications o f

climate change for the country’s important tourist industry. The new strategy will give
special emphasis to protecting the poor while enhancing competitiveness and
strengthening public institutions for performance accountability in the country.

73.
As reflected in Figure 4, this objective and priority areas will be addressed by a
combination o f analytical work, technical assistance, and investment and policy-based
lending to achieve 4 strategic objectives: (i)strengthen social cohesion and improve
access to and quality o f social services, (ii)
promote competitiveness in a sustainable and
resilient economic environment, (iii)enhance quality o f public expenditures and
institutional development, and (iv) build capacity and constituencies for reform.
74.
The IBRD country envelope for the DR i s s t i l l under discussion within the Bank.
Once the envelope i s determined, the lending plans over the partnership period will
remain indicative as has been the case in past practice. The Bank’s capacity to lend can
change over time and there i s a higher degree o f certainty that lending plans indicated for
the earlier years o f the CPS period can be delivered than for the outer years. The
proposed pipeline i s predicated on an indicative envelope o f US$500 million.

August 12, 2009

Strategic Objective I : Strengthen Social Cohesion and Improve Access to and Quality
of Social Services

75.
This first strategic objective o f the CPS supports the DR in protecting the
vulnerable segments of the population from the effects o f the international financial crisis
and producing better social outcomes, especially for the poorest Dominican citizens. This
objective i s fully aligned with the National Development Strategy that calls for
broadening good-quality employment opportunities, reducing poverty, protecting
vulnerable populations with adequate safety nets- including the CCT program
Solidaridad, and providing better education quality and universal access to health
services. WBG actions included under this strategic objective will support the
Government in achieving four main strategic outcomes: (i)improved effectiveness o f the
social protection system in preserving and promoting human capital for the poorest
Dominicans; (ii)improved quality o f mother and child healthcare services; (iii)increased
access to and quality o f education; and (iv) improved employability o f the poor-at-risk
youth. The Government program will require additional resources to achieve these
objectives and other international agencies (e.g. IDB) are supporting the internal revenue
service to bolster tax collection.
76.
In line with the international financial crisis context and long overdue reforms, the
CPS takes a broad-based approach to social protection. I t will assist the Government in
strengthening the effectiveness o f the CCT program Solidaridad - a program that was
covered b y the past CPS - by working on both the demand and supply-side for needed
investments in human capital. Through a combination o f instruments and in strong
coordination with the IDB and other donors, the CPS will work to expand the capacity o f
the CCT program and equip it with the design features o f best practice CCTs in the
region. This will include ensuring additional levels o f transparency, developing a sounds
system o f social accountability, effectively conditioning payments to pre-specified
investments in health and education by families, developing a comprehensive system o f
process and impact evaluation. At the same time, the CPS will support complementary
actions to adapt and/or improve the supply o f health and education services. Within this
first strategic objective, the CPS will give special attention to gender issues, migration,
and rural poverty. Specific objectives and outcomes o f this and the next three strategic
objectives are included in the Results Matrix presented in Annex 1.

77.
The Bank will engage in this area through lending which could include (i)
strengthening the existing social protection loan through additional financing to improve
Solidaridad performance; (ii)provided that a sound medium-term macroeconomic
framework exists, delivering a new programmatic D P L for the social sectors
(Performance and Accountability o f Social Sectors - PASS); and (iii)implementing the
Health Sector Reform - Adaptable Program Loan (PARSS 11) - to contribute to the
strategic plan o f the Government to improve quality o f public expenditures in the health
sector and (iv) continued support for the implementation o f the Youth Development
Project, which provides opportunities for young poor at risk to strengthen their skills and
employability and conclude secondary education. To support the Government’s response
to the crisis, the CPS may consider a restructuring o f this project to enable the piloting o f
a program to provide temporary employment and/or skills development opportunities to
young adults and other workers-formal and informal affected by the economic downturn.
27

78.
In addition, two AAAs will be considered to underpin the Bank's support towards
a Social Cohesion Programmatic NLTA, which
attainment o f this strategic objective: (i)
will include (a) a Programmatic Social Sectors technical assistance, which will closely
support the design and implementation o f the PASS DPL; (b) activities to continue the
support given to SEEPyD on evidence-based policy making for the formulation o f the
National Development Strategy - with a focus on providing technical support on
measuring the results o f distributional impacts o f policies, and (c) support to improve the
performance o f DR's community-based citizen security program (Barrio Seguro). This
NLTA will help improve the performance o f DRs community-based citizen security
program (Barrio Seguro) through strengthening i t s approach to local public private
partnerships, particularly the engagement o f the private sector in prevention activities.
Trust fund resources are available for this work to start in FY 10 - along with potential
contributions o f other donors in the field; and there i s an ongoing Avian Influenza
Prevention N L T A (a US$I million grant) which i s coordinated in partnership with the
Inter-American Institute for Agriculture Cooperation (IICA). The Bank i s also closely
coordinating these actions with other donors in these areas. For example the European
Commission and the International Development Agency o f Spain are focusing their
budget support on the education and health sectors. The IDB i s providing support to
education (Multiphase Program for Education Equality) and promoting the strengthening
o f the National Employment System (Strengthening o f the National Employment
System). The European Commission i s also providing budget support to the Ministry o f
Education (€38.5 million).
79.
IFC will also play a role in leveraging private sector resources to enhance the
DR's human capital base. One envisaged area i s supporting private university outreach
to students from l o w and middle income families.
Strategic Objective II:Promote Competitiveness in a Sustainable and Resilient
Economic Environment

80.
The second strategic objective o f the CPS focuses on helping to create the
necessary conditions for equitable economic growth and private sector development.
Activities aimed at achieving this strategic objective will support the Government in
promoting competitiveness in a sustainable and resilient economic environment. These
activities are fully aligned with the National Development Strategy, which calls for
equitable growth, macro-economic sustainability, productive development and
competitiveness, reliable provision o f energy, the implementation o f a strategy for
mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and developing an efficient risk
management scheme for disaster management. Actions included under this strategic
objective will support the Government in achieving four main outcomes: (i)broader
information base for informing policy decisions on macro-financial stability,
competitiveness, and economic relations with Haiti; and (ii)improved performance o f
water and sanitation corporations in tourist areas; (iii)increased efficiency in power
distribution and generation to improve quality o f services; and (iv) disaster risk
management mainstreamed into the planning process and strengthened institutional
capacity for risk management in specific sectors. By focusing on achieving equitable
growth, activities under this strategic objective will support the Government in defining

28

F Y I 0-13 Countrv Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Republic

Auaust 12, 2009

policies that would allow broad segments o f the population to benefit from relatively high
growth rates.

81.
The Bank will support this objective through continued implementation o f the (i)
Electricity Distribution and Rehabilitation Loan, (ii)Power Sector Technical Assistance
Emergency Recovery Loan, (iv) Water and Sanitation Loan, and (v) Financial
Loan, (iii)
Sector Technical Assistance Loan to continue supporting the country in addressing the
challenges of the financial sector, added to the work conducted by the IDB in this front
through a policy-based type o f operation. In addition, the implementation o f the
Programmatic D P L on Performance and Accountability o f Social Sectors will also
contribute to this strategic objective as it will require the existence o f a sound mediumterm macroeconomic framework. Other donors are well positioned to support rural
productivity. USAID i s implementing a number o f rural activities under i t s
competitiveness pillar and the IDB implementing an investment loan to support small and
medium producers - Apoyo a la Transicion Competitiva Agro-Aleimentaria (PAC)

82.
The CPS will consider five AAAs to achieve this strategic objective, as follows:
(i)At the request o f the Government, “La Hispaniola” Country Economic Memorandum,
which will explore the potential opportunities o f joint growth and poverty reduction
derived essentially from fostering deeper economic relationship among the two nations,
(ii)a Treasury Country Banking Service NLTA, to support the Government in closely
monitoring public debt and facilitate WBG engagement in on-going policy dialogue and
prevent debt from becoming a source o f macroeconomic vulnerability; (iii)a
Competitiveness NLTA, which will include (a) a regional DR-CAFTA ESW, (b)
technical assistance on logistics, (c) fostering gender equity in selected firms, (d)
supporting the implementation o f doing business reforms with IFC, (e) strengthening
agricultural productivity (in close coordination with current activities conducted by IDB
and IICA); ( f ) strengthening regional connectivity and investments to support the
Government in developing i t s I C T sector strategic plan: “e-Dominicana”; (iv) an
Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management NLTA, which will focus
on the assessment o f climate impacts on the surface hydrology o f the country , and will
support the incorporation o f risk reduction in national, sectoral and territorial planning.
These actions will be closely coordinated with the Special Climate Change Fund.
Together with the Bank, and potential donors, I F C will seek to involve the private sector
in disaster risk management should opportunities arise. The Bank i s closely working with
the UNDP’s Disaster Prevention and Preparedness program (programa de Prevencion y
Preparacidn a Desastres -PPD) and the Spanish International Cooperation Agency which
will support the Fondo p a r a la Prevencion y Respuesta a las Emergencias with €8
million; and (v) an Energy Sector NLTA and Investments (which includes a strong
emphasis on political economy issues) - to support the development o f a comprehensive
strategy for the reform o f the energy sector in the DR in collaboration with the IDB and
IFC’s efforts to promote additional private sector investments in energy efficiency, and in
cleaner and renewable energy. There are good opportunities for additional donor
coordination in these areas, The IDB has operations to improve the management and
design o f fiscal policy, to mitigate disasters and to improve water and sanitation
(Consolidation Program for the Reform and Modernization o f Water and Sanitation). The
UNDP and the European Commission are joining efforts to mitigate disasters through the

29

FYI0-13 Country Partnership Strateav for the Dominican Republic

Aunust 12, 2009

UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and EU Strategy for Supporting
Disaster Risk Reduction in Developing Countries.

83.

In addition, with the objective o f promoting the competitiveness o f local
industries, I F C will continue i t s activities in transport and logistics. IFC’s past
investments have positively impacted the tourism industry (ports and airports). Further
investments could facilitate market access for agricultural and manufacturing products,
including export. IFC will support opportunities in the real sectors when leading to
sustainable private sector investment. Bank work under the C E M will facilitate IFC’s
selection o f areas o f focus. As noted above most o f IFC’s program will help improve the
competitiveness o f the real sectors. Concerning tourism, IFC has developed a more
integrated approach involving investments in transport and logistics, energy efficiency,
cleaner energy and renewables. This i s part o f the Corporation Caribbean region overall
objective o f promoting the expansion o f commercial lending programs by local financial
institutions targeting local hoteliers to: improve efficiency o f energy consumption,
reducing carbon emissions, reducing dependency on imported oil, and supporting the use
o f cleaner technologies and renewables.

84.
Finally, the financial sector i s a priority for IFC’s strategy in the Dominican
Republic. IFC will be focusing on: (i)enhancing access to finance b y supporting the
portfolio growth o f banks as well as other financial intermediaries, especially with
respect to microfinance and SME lending with an emphasis on lending to women in rural
areas and, (ii)contributing to strengthening the financial sector through equity
investments in banks and potentially the creation o f a secondary market mortgage
company. Such efforts consist primarily o f investment products and, when relevant,
advisory services.
Strategic Objective 111: Enhance Quality of Public Expenditures and Institutional
Development

85.
The third strategic objective o f this CPS is to enhance the quality and efficiency
o f public expenditures and promote institutional development o f the Dominican public
administration. Activities included in the CPS to achieve this objective are aligned with
the National Development Strategy that calls for strengthening institutions at the national
and regional levels, better quality o f public expenditures, public security, good
governance, and the development o f a results culture within the public administration.
Actions included under this strategic objective will support the Government in achieving
three main strategic outcomes: (i)
improved budget management; (ii)
significant progress
towards performance-informed budget management; and (iii)increased rural poor
municipalities’ management capacity. The CPS will support the Government in
strengthening public institutions’ accountability and their capacity to plan and deliver
results. Activities under this strategic objective will include the implementation o f sound
public financial management systems, the consolidation o f transparent and efficient
procurement mechanisms, the strengthening o f audit schemes, and the implementation o f
results-based management techniques.

86.
Finally the Government i s closely coordinating efforts with other donors in these
areas. For example the IDB has two operations for institutional strengthening and the
implementation o f a performance agenda (Social Management Reform Program and the
30

’

FY10-13 Countrv Partnershtu Stratem for the Dominican Reuublic

Auaust 12, 2009

Support o f the Instrumentation o f Performance-based management) and the UNDP has
various governance related projects to strengthen the Junta Central Electoral and the
Lower Chamber.

87.
In addition, given that it lies at the core o f the DR’s development challenges,
governance will be mainstreamed as a fundamental element o f the activities defined to
achieve the other 3 strategic objectives o f the CPS. For example, institutional analysis
will be conducted for critical sectors (e.g. energy, health) and specially designed
mechanisms will be financed for increased accountability in service delivery. Special
emphasis will be given to support Congress in i t s oversight capacity and accountability
between Government agencies and civil society.
88.
This third strategic objective will be supported b y the implementation o f the
Programmatic D P L on Performance and Accountability o f Social Sectors (provided that
there i s a sound medium-term macroeconomic framework in place) - which includes a
component to support a series o f reforms to build a culture o f results in public
administration, by the Municipal Development Investment Loan, which will include
institutional development activities to strengthening capacity o f local Governments and
by the second Health Sector Reform Loan (PARSS 11) - which includes a series o f
actions to support performance based management within the health sector.
89.
In order to help achieve this strategic objective, the CPS will consider two AAAs:
(i)
Quality o f Public Expenditures NLTA, which will focus on improving the quality o f
public expenditures in the DR by strengthening financial management and procurement
mechanisms and strengthening the oversight capacity o f various actors. This
multisectoral NLTA includes the development o f a National Procurement Strategy, the
application o f the OECD Indicators on procurement, technical assistance to SEEPyD,
Finance and Public Administration, and the support to the DR Supreme Audit Institution.
Activities on this front are closely coordinated with the IDB, the UNDP, and the
European Commission, which i s already supporting the Secretary o f Public
Administration with €8 million; and (ii)Institutional and Governance Review (ESW)
which will focus on underlying political economy and governance issues that prevent the
country from addressing fundamental development challenges in key sectors like
education, health, and energy. A set o f safeguards capacity building activities will help
achieve this strategic objective b y offering assistance to the Dominican Republic to
manage social and environmental opportunities and risks at a strategic level. Analytical
work and technical assistance will support the Dominican Republic in strengthening i t s
norms and institutions to incorporate management o f the Bank’s safeguards policies as
well as other international good practice frameworks in a coordinated manner.
Strategic Objective IV: Build Capaciq and Constituenciesfor Reform

90.
The fourth strategic objective o f the CPS i s to help build capacity and
constituencies for reform. Activities aimed at achieving this objective are aligned with
the National Development Strategy that calls for strengthening democratic governance
and active participation o f civil society and the private sector. Actions included in the
CPS will support the Government in achieving three main outcomes: (i)strengthening
congressional budget oversight capacity; (ii)strengthened civil society capacity for

31

FYIO-13 Countw Partnershir, Stratem for the Dominican Republic

Auaust 12, 2009

budget analysis and monitoring; and (iii)enhanced participatory planning at the local
level.
91.
In response to the demand identified during the consultations with civil society
and Government officials, the CPS includes a fourth strategic objective to help build
capacity and constituencies for reform, including Congress, civil society, and the private
sector. Addressing development challenges in the DR requires the collaboration o f a
number of actors beyond the Government. As learned during the previous CAS,
promoting, implementing, and sustaining reforms requires a strong constituency with
enough capacity to mobilize critical stakeholders and resources. Working with civil
society i s at the core o f other international agencies. For example, USAID has a program
that promotes the participation o f Civil Society to fight corruption and the U N D P has
various projects to strengthen civil society capability to interact and influence policy
making process at the national and municipal level.
92.
C i v i l society has played a major role in raising awareness about the problems o f
corruption, weak governance and accountability. Since the early 1990s, civil society has
progressively strengthened i t s voice in the policymaking process, particularly b y
fostering public debate and influencing decision-making through concrete policy
proposals around key public interest issues such as poverty reduction, state reforms and
transparency. However, civil society organizations s t i l l lack the capacity to mobilize
grassroots movements throughout the country. The reach o f civil society organizations i s
strong both at the national and the sub-national levels, but only a few have been able to
develop the capacity to monitor Government performance and transparency.
93.
In terms o f lending, both policy-based and investment loans will include work
with these stakeholders and a number o f non-lending technical assistance activities and
analytical pieces will focus on capacity building actions. For example, the Social
Protection Loan includes the participation o f civil society organizations in monitoring the
implementation o f the program and the Programmatic D P L on Performance and
Accountability o f Social Sectors helps build the necessary conditions for the
establishment o f social accountability mechanisms around budget formulation and
execution.
94.
Finally, this strategic objective will consider 2 AAAs, as follows: (i) an
Institutional Development Fund for Strengthening Congressional Oversight, to help
improve accountability o f public sector performance in the DR b y strengthening the
institutional capacity o f Congress to conduct i t s oversight role within the new public
financial management (PFM) framework; and (ii)a NLTA for Strengthening Civil
Society, which will support activities to strengthen the capacity o f civil society to be an
effective stakeholder to promote change and an effective development partner - and
capacity building o f civil society actors for engaging in participatory policy formulation,
monitoring and evaluation. This will include the definition o f a medium term capacity
building program for civil society organizations - including community-based groups (in
collaboration with USAID), and the establishment o f social observatories for increasing
accountability o f the social sectors. This NLTA will also include the establishment o f a
Corporate Governance Institute, supported by IFC’s work with private sector
representatives including leading corporate, major banks, chamber o f commerce, and
other financial institutions.

IMPLEMENTING
THE COUNTRY
PARTNERSHIP
STRATEGY

95.
The CPS will be based on a flexible approach given the existing uncertainty derived from the international financial crisis - over the medium-term macroeconomic
framework. The strategy calls for a combination o f policy-based and investment lending,
which w i l l provide enough flexibility for i t s implementation. However, if the
macroeconomic situation deteriorates, the CPS w i l l shift towards alternative instruments
to support the Government. Instead o f relying on a combination o f policy-based and
investment lending, the CPS may emphasize the increased use o f investment lending.

96.
For Bank operations, as reflected in Table 7 , the new CPS will be based on the
implementation o f 9 existing investment loans and 3 new investment loans currently
under preparation, a programmatic series o f AAA, and a programmatic single-tranche
series o f DPLs aimed at reducing the existing vulnerabilities facing the DR today and
increasing Government's accountability for results. In view o f the innovative nature o f
this type o f operation for the DR, this Programmatic DPL w i l l be implemented on a pilot
basis. An evaluation w i l l be conducted after the implementation o f the f i r s t loan included
in this series. The results o f this evaluation w i l l inform the design o f subsequent loans in
the series or the adoption o f alternative lending modalities.

97.
NLTA activities will be combined with analytical work (ESW) and existing and
new investment operations while keeping a close linkage with the programmatic D P L
series. Building on the successful results o f the AAA included in the previous CAS
period, the new CPS will support a number o f strategically defined programmatic AAA
products, including non-lending technical assistance, policy dialogue, and economic and
sector work (ESW). This, in turn, will support participating agencies in achieving policy
commitments and outcomes included in the Programmatic D P L series. This new series o f
AAA will be closely coordinated - and where possible co-financed - with other
international agencies operating in the DR.
98.
NLTAs and other AAA will be financed with Bank budget, donor contributions
(in the form o f externally-funded outputs - EFOs), and with the use o f trust funds (e.g.
Institutional Development Funds - IDFs - for institutional development; FIRST initiative
funds for developing professional certification o f auditors; Japan Social Development
Fund (JSDF) for enhancing the chances for social inclusion and citizen participation, and
other). On selected products, the Bank will explore possibilities for engaging the
Government in fee-based services.
Country Financing Parameters

99.
Changes in responsibilities emerged from the implementation o f the public debt
law, budget law, and the creation o f the Ministry o f Economy, Planning, and
Development and the new Ministry o f Finance (2006), resulted in a Government request
to change the Country Financing Parameters (CFP) to adjust Bank financing cost-share
up to 100 percent (see Annex 9). These changes were introduced after the Country
Portfolio Performance Review conducted in 2007.
Improving Porrfolio Performance

100. As o f June 30th, 2009, the Dominican Republic’s portfolio consisted o f 9
investment projects under implementation for a net commitment o f US$285.7 million, o f
which US$2 17 million remained undisbursed. The l o w disbursement i s explained by the
fact that more than 50 per cent (US$122 million) o f the undisbursed amount belongs to 2
projects that became effective in the last quarter o f FY09. In addition, 4 grants are under
implementation equivalent to US$3.7 million, o f which US$2.7 remained undisbursed.
B y the end o f FY09, there was one project at risk whose net commitment was equal to 11
per cent o f the total commitment amount.
Alignment with the Paris Declaration - Moving Towards Greater Ownership and
Focus on Results

101, Donor coordination and harmonization efforts have increased, especially since the
establishment of a Bank office in Santo Domingo in 1999. The Bank chairs the monthly
donor meeting and i s in close contact with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN) agencies as well as with bilateral
agencies and international NGOs. Examples o f collaboration include coordination
around the implementation o f HIV/AIDS projects (Global Fund), the 2006 Poverty
Assessment (IDB), participation in each other’s missions (IDB social protection), and the
34

FYI 0-1 3 Count? Partnership Strateqfor the Dominican Republic

Auaust 12, 2009

Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment (EU). Another example i s
the strong partnership formed for the 2006 Youth Development Marketplace which
included the EU, IDB, UN agencies, bilateral agencies and NGOs as well as both private
and public sector partners. While there are no SWAps at present, a SWAP in the health
sector i s being discussed in order to better coordinate assistance.

102. The proposed approach i s fully consistent with the principles agreed in the Paris
Declaration, in 2005 : (i)ownership, (ii)
alignment, (iii)
harmonization, (iv) managing for
results and (v) mutual accountability. In line with these principles and according to the
concrete recommendations emerging from the Accra meeting in 2008, the proposed
strategy places special emphasis on increasing the scope o f development policy dialogue
at the national level, strengthening and taking advantage o f country systems (when
possible), welcoming and working with all the actors involved in development,
deepening the working relation with civil society, concentrating in achieving results,
increasing results’ transparency and accountability, and continuing to base conditionality
on the countries’ development strategies. The proposed strategy will also focus on
strengthening the capacity o f Government counterparts, with the objective that in the
medium term, projects could be managed without the creation o f project implementation
units.

103. The IDB i s currently defining i t s own strategy for the DR. I t s current portfolio
includes projects in education, labor markets, quality o f public expenditures, transport,
rural development, and energy. In 2009, the IDB i s expected to have new commitments
for US$255 million in i t s regular portfolio and a US$500 million in emergency loans to
support the DR during the international financial crisis. The European Commission (EC)
i s another important player in the DR. The EC focuses on the following 3 main lines o f
work, making i t a strong potential partner for the Bank in the country: (i)governance, (ii)
poverty, and (iii)bilateral relationships between the DR and Haiti. I t s operations consist
mainly o f budgetary support, estimated at €200 million for the next 5 years.
104. There i s an initial agreement with the European Union and the Spanish
International Development agency to align efforts and come up with “convergent”
matrices to guide these institutions’ budget support programs and find complementarities
on technical assistance interventions. A memorandum o f understanding between these
agencies and the Bank i s now being drafted. USAID and the French Development
Agency have also expressed their willingness to provide technical assistance in a
coordinated way. For this, a series o f key policy reforms and expected outcomes are
being discussed among agencies and agreed with Government counterparts. Table 8
illustrates the main efforts o f the international agencies in supporting the Government’s
strategy.

MIGA PROGRAM

105. Currently, M I G A i s working with the sponsors o f another transportation project in
the D R which, if it can achieve financing, would double MIGA’s exposure in the country.
Furthermore, M I G A has been approached by investors in agricultural and tourism to
discuss potential support for other operations. However, the current global financial
crisis seems to be delaying the larger projects, so i t i s unclear if or when these potential
transactions will come to fruition.
E.

WBIPROGRAM

106.

A t the time o f CPS preparation, W B I was undergoing a comprehensive renewal
process with the aim o f increasing impact and outreach and placing greater emphasis on
innovation, learning and knowledge sharing. The scope and content o f the Institute’s
future offerings for D R participants w i l l be determined together with the LCR Region
once WBI’s new medium term strategy i s in place. I t i s envisaged, however, that the shift
away from country specific towards multi-country learning programs w i l l continue. The
thematic composition o f the future programs are likely to be determined in light o f the
governance oriented activities that have been delivered in the past (informatiodmedia,
youth, support to Congress) as well as the priority themes identified in LCR’s Region
wide strategy (Le. trade/competitiveness, climate change, energy, social opportunities and

36

governance). Finally the Gobierno Abierto y Participativo (GAP) that focuses on
strengthening local governance will begin i t s implementation in the DR in FY 10.

F.

MONITORING
AND EVALUATION
(M&E)

107. The CPS will rely on a combination o f M&E mechanisms. First, the CPS will
contribute to strengthening the existing M&E systems existing in the DR. The Bank has
already approved an IDF grant to help strengthen this capacity within the National
Statistical Office in close coordination with SEEPyD. In addition, the CPS will support
participatory M&E mechanisms led by civil society organization - including, but not
limited to, citizen report cards, community scorecards, and participatory councils.
Finally, Bank staff will continue to conduct systematic supervision o f the Bank-financed
projects and the implementation o f performance contracts.
I V . MANAGING R I S K S

108. Implementation Risks. The new CPS will require close coordination between
the Ministries o f Finance, Planning, and Public Administration on the one hand, and the
spending ministries on the other. While this situation exists in other countries as well, it
constitutes a particular risk in the DR because these ministries are key for the
implementation o f the Investment and Planning Law, on which the new D P L series i s
based. I t i s expected that this risk will be mitigated by providing systematic technical
assistance to these agencies and b y the strong incentive to cooperate in order to access
Bank funds. In addition, the fact that World Bank loans require congressional ratification
may create effectiveness delays. The Bank i s already working with members o f Congress
- in close coordination with counterparts in Government - to increase awareness o f the
W B G program and how i t helps address development challenges in the DR.

109. Economic Risks. Conditioning further Bank support on a number o f critical
reforms that the country needs could produce lasting results and i s predicated on firm
Government commitment to the reform process. Policy actions need to be carefully
defined and monitored. This process should provide adequate flexibility to make the
necessary adjustments over time and provide the client with a reasonable level o f
confidence that targets could be met and therefore, funds will be disbursed. In addition,
having a balanced approach and ensuring that investment operations are strategically
designed will help mitigate this risk.
110. An additional economic risk i s a major external shock that inhibits the
Government from undertaking policy changes, or diverts i t s attention to more day-to-day
issues. Such shocks could include tropical storm damage, significantly higher oil prices,
or the denial o f access to external credit markets because o f creditworthiness concerns.
In this case, the Bank might have to develop a lending program that i s more focused on
emergency response. In fact the current portfolio has a number o f operations already
under implementation that could be scaled-up to help the country cope with the shocks
identified above and the proposed CPS includes specific interventions that may help
mitigate this risk.
111. Finally, since the CPS contemplates the possibility o f supporting the Government
with a series o f DPLs, having a sound medium-term macroeconomic framework i s

37

FYI 0-1 3 Countrv Partnership Strateav for the Dominican Retwblic

August 12, 2009

necessary. The Bank will closely work with other international agencies to support the
Government in maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework including addressing
potential financing gaps. In addition, the CPS will retain a flexible approach, to enable it
to shift more strongly towards investment lending if necessary.

112. Operational Risks. The proposed model requires the full adoption o f a multisectoral approach, both within the Bank and in Government. The model can be effective
in reducing transaction costs in Bank operations while addressing development
challenges at the country level. To mitigate this, a system for monitoring and evaluating
the new scheme will be put in place, based on systematic portfolio monitoring and a
robust CPS Progress Report. In addition, the Bank will continue the implementation o f i t s
capacity building program on fiduciary areas - especially on financial management and
procurement - and the series o f training sessions to Government counterparts on
operational issues associated with Bank-financed projects.

Annex 3: Lessons Learned from the Recent Past
Lessons from CAS Completion Report

1.
A comprehensive CAS Completion Report i s now being finalize. The report
focuses on the implementation o f the CAS FY06-09, for which analysis o f secondary
data was made and over 24 o f interviews with task team leaders, sector leaders, and
sector managers were held. A draft document was shared and benefited from the
feedback o f members o f the DR Country Team.
2.
The CAS Completion Report concludes that the DR i s a challenging country
in which to work. Often Government signals about what i s needed from the Bank are
not followed up with the appropriate actions. I t is, at times, even hard to know who
speaks for “the Government”. Any future strategy w i l l have to decide where the
Bank’s comparative advantage lies, particularly given that i t i s not the biggest or most
important donor/source o f finance. The lessons that seem to emerge from this CAS
completion review are:
Keep focused on a few key sectors where there i s some potential for success
and where Bank advice i s appreciated (if not always followed): education,
health, safety nets, and perhaps power.
Set realistic objectives and targets that can be measured,
The focus o f public sector reform should be on maintaining accountability and
transparency in Government operations, including budget formulation and
execution, and improving the voice o f civil society,
Adopt a comprehensive approach and include political economy dimensions
when dealing with the energy sector,
U s e ESW to focus on untraceable problems like corruption, drugs, money
laundering, crime and violence, public sector reform. Conduct ESW
cooperatively with partners in country, so as to build ownership and local
capacity,
Strengthen Civil Society capacity to build constituency for the reform and
engage with Congress for dealing with complex development challenges in
the country; and
Strengthen donor coordination by mapping donor’s interventions and priority
areas as well as aligning efforts for Policy Reform.
Lessons from Country Assistance Evaluation

3.
Some o f the conclusions o f the 2003 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE)
conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group o f the Bank are s t i l l relevant today.
First, the report concluded that above all, the Bank should work to continue to
improve i t s dialogue with the country. Second, the CAE emphasized the need to
continue the strategic engagement in the energy sector, with a strong emphasis on i t s
regulatory regime and issues o f efficiency and effectiveness o f the service.

Lessons from Consultationswith Civil Society

A series o f consultations with civil society actors for the definition o f the CPS
took place in the DR, in January 2009. Over 200 organizations participated in 4
consultations that were held in L a Romana, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Barahona

4.

- covering all regions o f the country.
Imulications of the M C Reuort

In 2006, the Development
Committee of the IMF and the
World Bank produced a paper to
“Strengthening the World Bank’s
Engagement with IBRD Partner
Countries.” The report presents a
number of recommendations
applicable to 79 middle-income
countries (MICs) on how the IBRD
can become more effective in
delivering flexible, high quality and
cost -effective menu o f services for
achieving development results
The report concluded that key
services to be improved for MICs
should cover the following five
areas: (i)
strategy and coordination
services, by reflecting countryspecific needs and priorities and
accelerating the responsiveness o f
the Bank to client demands; (ii)
financial services, by making Bank
financial services more competitive,
developing approaches to help
catalyze market-based solutions, and
streamlining Bank procedures, (iii)
knowledge services, with a strong
focus on building on the Bank’s
comparative advantages,
strengthening linkages between
research and operational work and
eliminating barriers for the delivery
of global expertise, (iv) WBG
synergies, making sure that IBRD,
IFC and MIGA could strengthen
their collaboration for development
results, and (v) ensuring
coordination among international
cooperation agencies and fostering
partnerships for development.

5.
These
meetings
were
highly
productive and the process was successful in
achieving i t s objectives. Civil society
participants provided important inputs to the
Bank and i t was a good way for the Bank to
reach-out to a number o f nontraditional
partners. The following are a sample o f the
main messages we heard during these 4
sessions.
0
Civil society organizations recognized
the value added o f the Bank in the DR as a
strategic partner for development and
requested the Bank to provide channels for a
sustained and systematic dialogue with CSOs;
0

Participants requested the Bank to

help keep the Government accountable. They
seem to trust the Bank over their own
authorities.
0
There i s strong demand for the Bank
to deepening its direct engagement with civil
society, through capacity building activities
and when possible, through funding;
0
There i s a pending agenda on
territorial development with a strong
emphasis on local and participatory planning;
0
Support micro, medium and small
producers with technical knowledge and
access to markets;

0
Eco-tourism was mentioned as an
important priority a number o f times;
0
Increasing the quality o f education
and health i s a priority and addressing
institutional issues within these sectors i s
important (e.g. corruption); and
0
Rule o f law i s weak and Government
officials need to be accountable to their
constituencies;

In addition to these 4 consultations, additional consultations will be held with
civil society and business sector groups in New York City and a Client Survey administrated to 300 key stakeholders in the DR i s now being implemented.
Lessons from other International Development Agencies Operating in the DR

7.
A special coordination. meeting with other international agencies operating in
the DR was held in November, 2008. There was some level o f skepticism among
donors triggered b y recent political developments and the lack o f results in the
different agencies’ projects portfolios. However, most participants agreed that our
actions in the DR should be guided by strengthening institutions and improving
governance in the country. As summarized by one o f the participants, “governance i s
at the core o f the development challenges o f this country and the multilateral
organization could help in providing transparency and discipline to public
administration.”

Annex 4: DR CAS Completion Report - FY05-FY09
1.
This CAS Completion Report (CAS-CR) evaluates the effectiveness o f the
Bank’s 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Dominican Republic (DR).
W h i l e the CAS period covered FY06-09, this review also includes some o f the
progress made in FY04 and earlier for background information. This report reviews
the Bank’s strategic objectives, program o f support and their relevance to the
Government’s development goals. The report also assesses to what extent the Bank
was successful in meeting these objectives and draws lessons to guide the design o f
the new country strategy for FY10-13. The methodology for the production o f this
report includes the analysis o f secondary data, a number o f interviews with Bank staff
working on the DR program, and a number o f interviews with high ranked Dominican
Government officials and members o f the civil society and the private sector.

I.
1.1

The CAS Strategy and Objectives

Country Context and Background to the CAS

2.
After a financial crisis in the early 1990s, the Government adopted a series o f
economic reforms which resulted in a strong rebound. Growth during the 1990s
averaged about 6 per cent per year, fueled by tourism, telecommunications and the
free-trade zones, all beneficiaries o f the reform program. Social indicators improved,
and poverty declined, but distortions s t i l l persisted in many areas, especially in
agriculture and industry.
3.
The role o f the Bank during this period was modest. The IDB had a much
bigger influence, with 2-3 times the amount o f the Bank’s lending. The Bank had a
strong voice in the policy dialogue on structural reforms, but the dialogue was
difficult and discontinuous. While structural adjustment lending was included in the
country strategies o f that time, such lending did not materialize through the mid
1990s’ because o f the country’s sensitivity to external interference and because o f the
uncertainty with regards to the country’s commitment to reform5. An IEG review o f
this period noted that completed projects during this time were below average in
terms o f outcomes, institutional development impact and sustainability. While
projects in the basic education sector were highly successful, those in such areas as
energy and transport sectors experienced major implementation difficulties and had
little institutional development impact6.
4.
The period o f strong growth came to an end in 2003, when the Dominican
economy was plunged into a crisis with revelation o f a major bank fraud, and the
collapse o f several o f i t s major banks. Government deficits widened, growth slowed,
inflation accelerated, and the Government could not reach agreement with the I M F on
a stabilization program.

5.
After two years o f deep economic crisis, a new Government under President
Leone1 Fernandez was elected in 2004. The. program o f the new President was

contained in his party (PLD) platform. This can be summarized under four main
pillars:
0

Restore macroeconomic stability to reengage in growth;

0

Consolidate democratic governance b y strengthening key public institutions;
Engender a greater level o f social and territorial cohesion in Dominican
society; and

0

Improve the competitiveness o f the Dominican economy.

6.
As a result, the new Government initiated a strong stabilization program
immediately on assuming office, including agreement on a program with the IMF.
The banking sector was strengthened, inflation was brought under control, and
initiatives were introduced to control corruption and waste. One negative aspect o f
the program in terms o f Bank lending was a “freeze” or limit on new external
borrowing, designed to control the expansion o f foreign debt. This “freeze” during
2006 meant delays or postponements in several proposed Bank projects, as well as
those o f the IDB and other donors.

1.2

The Political Economy Context

7.
The DR i s a country characterized by a high degree o f politicalization o f the
Government process, resulting in a climate o f political favors, rent-seeking and
allocation decisions based on non-economic criteria. In a paper written in 2002,7
Philip Keefer noted that his interviews in the DR revealed a strong element o f
clientelism in the country. One consequence o f this, Keefer pointed out, i s a bias in
public spending toward goods and services that are easy to target to specific voters,
such as jobs, buildings and highways, and not such more difficult to target items such
as teacher salaries, improved school curricula or regulatory predictability. Keefer
relates this to a number o f factors, including the absence o f national political
organizations capable o f making credible policy promises to voters, the
disproportionate representation o f rural areas in Congress and Senate, and the past
legacy o f personalized and de-institutionalized decision making.
8.
In the last several years, while there has been a major change in the ruling
political party, the pattern o f clientelism and political influence over economic
decision making might continue. W h i l e the Constitution lays out a system o f checks
and balances, and limitations on the power o f the President, the institutional
arrangements to enforce these limitations might be very weak. As a result, the budget
might be weakened by subsidies to special groups, and/or discounted prices o f public
services (e.g. electricity). Attempts to tighten laws and regulations, such as bank
regulation and public procurement, may often be resisted by those with a vested
interest in preserving the present system. In addition, civil society organizations
while numerous and important in social sectors, have limited capacity to hold
Government officials accountable.

The CAS Strategy

9.

The CAS o f 2005 developed a program o f support for the program o f the new
Government, focused on a number o f key areas. I t s stated main objective was an
“overarching focus on improving governance and strengthening institutions”’. This
was seen at that time as necessary to restore confidence in the country and restore
growth. Changes in governance were seen to occur both through a frontal attack on
public sector reform and through financial management reforms in sector operations.
Two main pillars supported this focus:
Stabilizing the economy, improving competitiveness, and restoring economic
growth; and
Achieving greater social equity through human development and increased
coverage and quality o f basic public services.

10.
The first o f these pillars i s clearly aligned with the overall strategy laid out in
the P L D party platform, noted above. The second supports the strategy o f “social and
territorial cohesion”, which includes the desire to reduce poverty and improve the
delivery o f social services.

1.4

Progress in Meeting CAS Objectives

11.
The FY05 CAS was not “results oriented”, and there were no explicit targets
for performance or results given.g Instead the “CAS Monitoring Framework” was
cast in terms o f policy actions required, and the indicators that could be used to
measure progress, but no baseline data or targets are given for these indicators. The
matrix was revised at the time o f the CAS Progress Report in 2007, and more
indicators and targets were added at that time, particularly in education and health
(see Annex Table I,which updates this matrix). However, many other areas lacked
indicators or targets at the time o f the Progress Report, and it was noted that “efforts
to determine benchmark and/or target values are ongoing”, despite the fact that the
progress report was completed in 2007, at the mid-point o f the CAS period. Thus, it i s
s t i l l difficult to judge progress in meeting CAS objectives in many areas.
A. The Overarching Objective - Public Sector Reform

12.
The 2006 CAS considered governance and institutional reform in the
public sector the “over-arching” objective. Upon assuming power in August 2004,
the new Government started many initiatives in this area, but once growth revived
there seems to have been a lack o f attention to this agenda. Overall governance
indicators o f the Bank’s WBI for the period 2003 to 2007 shows improvements in
such areas as “Voice and Accountability”, “Political Stability” and “Regulatory
Quality”. However, other areas such as “Government Effectiveness”, “Rule o f Law”,
and “Control o f Corruption” all show deterioration over the same period.

* Country Assistance Strategy for Dominican Republic, May 19, 2005, p. 1
It should be noted that the CAS was written before the introduction in the Bank o f the results-oriented
CAS.

13.
The Government created a National Commission on Ethics and Anticorruption in 2004, and an Anti-Corruption Agency was created in the AttorneyGeneral’s Office”. The Bank supported this work with an IDF grant. However, little
was accomplished b y the Commission. A program for the reporting o f assets b y
public servants, for instance, was never enforced, and the Commission i t s e l f proved
weak and ineffective.
14.
The Government did pass major legislation covering many key areas of
public financial management, including a new budget and treasury law, and a
law on transparency (public access). Also approved were a new procurement law,
an audit law, and the creation o f a stronger Finance ministry (Hacienda) which
combined finance, budget, external debt and procurement functions, as well as a
strengthened Ministry o f Economy, Planning and Development (Economia). These
reforms represent an attempt to limit Presidential discretionality over budget
execution, strengthen checks and balances, and enhance accountability for the
management o f public funds. However the implementation o f many o f these laws
varies across ministries. The Ministry o f Health and the Attorney General’s Office,
for instance, have made significant progress implementing these reforms (access to
information, procurement, financial mana ement), but this i s not duplicated in most
other ministries. The Camara de Cuentas , which i s in charge o f auditing, remains
weak and largely ineffective, in part because it lacks resources. The law on
transparency was passed, but no agency created to implement it, and as a result few
ministries grant real access to information. The procurement law i s far reaching, but
progress in implementation has been slow. Thus, there has been only limited progress
in increasing procurement efficiency and transparency.

7,

15.

There has been some limited progress in the reform of the public
financial management (PFM) system. Prior to 2006, public financial management
(PFM) did not adequately support the objectives o f aggregate fiscal discipline,
efficient resource allocation or operational efficiency. Budgeted revenue and
expenditure differed considerably from outturns, with the President exercising a high
degree o f discretion over spending, while expenditure control and procurement
systems were inadequate and fragmented and enforcement was weak. Recognizing
these weaknesses, the Dominican Republic has made some progress in P F M reform,
which inter alia has strengthened the legal and institutional framework for PFM.
These have included steps to limit Presidential discretionary spending, and
introducing a new financial management information system (SIGEF). Other steps
have been taken to consolidate budget formulation and treasury management in the
Ministry o f Finance, and the creation o f a new Ministry o f Economy, Planning and
Development to improve capital budgeting.

16.
The Government i s also focusing on improving the quality of public
expenditure. The Secretary o f Economy and Planning (SEEPYD) has published a
strategic plan to gradually introduce performance-informed budgeting techniques.

This includes the introduction o f a national investment system (Sistema Nacional de
Inversion Publica - SNIP) designed to enforce more rigorous program planning,
monitoring and evaluation standard^.'^ The first stage, a project registry, i s expected
to be completed by mid-2009. In addition, ‘Results Agreements’, that set out strategic
plans, objectives and identify performance measuredtargets will be agreed with four
priority Ministries during 2009: health, education, agriculture and natural resources
and environment. These first agreements w i l l be published as an annex in the 2010
Budget.
17.
Bank Support for public sector reform had limited success. The Bank was
not able to provide the kind o f support for public sector reform that was envisaged in
the CAS. A $10 million technical assistance loan, proposed for FY05, was dropped
by the Government during the “freeze” and given a low priority. It would have
supplemented the work o f the IDB in the public sector, with a focus on the
implementation of the Transparency Law, and extend public sector reforms to the
sector level. The proposed project had l i n k s to the Health APL. A DPL for Public
Sector Reform has never been initiated due to lack o f Government interest. The Bank
did support the development o f the Transparency Law through trust funds. The IDB
had a major role in public sector reform, providing support in a number o f areas,
including financial rnanagementl4.The Government considered the IDB as taking the
lead on this issue, and did not see the need to involve the World Bank as well. In
addition, the Congress had a bias against borrowing money to fund technical
assistance, and the Bank also lacked the resources to mount an effective dialogue on
sector issues, or identify a clear comparative advantage.
18.
However, the CAS strategy suggested that public sector reform would also be
part o f sector operations, with the objective o f making the general reforms (such as
procurement, transparency) operational at the sector level. This appears to have
happened only in the case o f health, through the Bank’s Health APL. The Bank did
undertake a Country Fiduciary Assessment in FY05, which pointed to the many
problems in public sector financial operations, particularly the weaknesses o f the
procurement system.
The Bank i s providing technical support for the development o f the
19.
National Development Strategy, which will define priorities for the public sector,
and set the frame for the production o f the MTEF. How effective these
instruments w i l l be in improving the efficiency o f Government spending has yet to be
seen. Allocations and contract awards may be heavily politicized while public
investment in schools, health, roads and power lag behind and hinder economic
growth.

20.
During the CAS period, the Government seemed to have lost focus in
reducing corruption and reforming the public sector once growth revived. As a result,
Government corruption remains a problem. On Transparency International’s

B. Stabilizing the Economy and Promoting Growth

21.
The Government has been very successful in stabilizing the economy and
restoring growth. Real growth has averaged over 9 per cent per annum for 3 years
(2005-2007), double what the CAS envisaged (see Table 1). Inflation has been
contained to single digits, and the fiscal position has shifted from primary deficits to
primary surpluses. At the same time, public debt ratio to GDP has declined
significantly and the reserve position o f the Central Bank has improved.
22.
Conditions in 2008 worsened somewhat, as a result o f the impact o f higher oil
and food prices and a slowdown in the world economy. Subsidies for energy and
food raised the budget deficit, and despite tighter monetary policy, inflation rose to
over 10 per cent. Growth i s estimated to have been about 5.3 per cent in 2008, and i s
likely to be lower in 2009, as the world recession affects tourism and other export
industries. The recession has also reduced access by the Government to foreign
borrowing.
23.
There has been a significant increase in private investment, reflecting the
better macroeconomic condition and improved investment climate. The IFC’s
“Doing Business 2009” put Dominican Republic in the top 10 reformers in the world.
Reforms cited included a reduction in the corporate income tax, and reductions in
taxes on transfers and registry o f property, and improvements in trade administration.
In addition, the Government has taken steps to improve the banking system, including
improved bank supervision.
24.
Foreign direct investment has been robust, leading to a rise in fixed capital
formation and a significant appreciation o f the peso. N e t direct investment flows rose
from $612 million in 2003 to $1.2 billion in 2007. Other important inflows include
remittances (peaking at almost $3 billionI6 in 2007), and unreported flows that may

real effective exchange rate rose 27 per cent between 2004 and 2007. Much o f these
inflows have been invested in real estate, and are responsible in large part for the
boom in construction.

25.
The financial sector has regained its health, and Central Bank
supervision o f commercial banks has improved. A Bank technical assistance loan
(FTAL) has provided assistance to the Government to improve the financial sector
regulatory and supervisory framework, and raise compliance with international
standardsI8. Improvements were also made in the payments system for clearing
checks between banks, the supervision o f securities, pension regulation and the public
debt management system. One part o f the financial sector that has not improved i s the
insurance industry, which opted out o f the FTAL. The financial sector also i s weak on
money laundering, and the DR remains attractive for illicit financial transactions for
the illegal drug trade.”
Significant impediments to growth and private investment still exist.
26.
Electricity i s relatively expensive compared to other Latin American countries, and
extremely unreliable. In September 2006, with the price o f oil about $60 per barrel,
the Government put a freeze on electricity prices, in an attempt to buffer the economy
from the high cost o f oil imports, the dominant fuel for electricity generation. The
Government intended to cover the losses o f the generation companies, but as world
prices rose, i t f e l l into arrears on these payments. This has effectively bankrupted the
electricity companies, and reduced their ability to provide power to the grid. The
result has been periodic black-outs. In addition, the cost o f electricity i s high because
o f theft, illegal connections, technical inefficiencies and a culture o f non-payment o f
bills. Government agencies often do not pay their electricity bills, and enjoy a status
o f being protected from being cut o f f from supplies. Politically well connected large
industrial and commercial users also can escape payment. Special pricing
arrangements reduce the cost o f electricity for special groups and areas.

’* W h i l e the FTAL was approved in February 2004, it did not become effective until August 2005.

B a n k Support for G r o w t h - t h e Power Sector

27.
The power sector in the DR has traditionally been problematic, suffering from
unreliable service and high electricity prices compared to neighboring countries. The
Bank has a long history o f involvement in the sector, going back to the 1980s, mostly
as investment operations. In this sector, the Government clearly seeks the Bank’s
technical leadership, and the Bank enjoys a predominant position over other donors.
The performance o f the sector, however, has been spotty at best.
28.

T h e inefficiencies o f the past were the result o f a heavily politicized public
sector utility a n d the failure to take corrective actions. Beginning in the 1990s, the
Government launched a reform program that broke up the state monopoly into
generation and transmission companies, some o f which were privatized. Two o f the
three privatized transmission companies became unprofitable, and reverted to

29.
The objective o f the Technical Assistance (TA) loan was to provide assistance
to the Government to help improve the transmission network and restore financial
sustainability o f the sector, as well as to increase attention to environmental, poverty
and consumer protection aspects. An updated Power Sector Strategy was developed
and adopted by the Government, and a number o f studies undertaken that have helped
contribute to the strengthening o f sector institutions.
30.
In terms o f Project Development Objectives, the main PDO o f the DPL was to
raise the cost recovery index CRI), or the ratio o f electricity generated and put into
the system to the amount o f electricity for which payments have been received2'. The
initial level o f 45 per cent in 2004 was expected to rise to 60 per cent under the DPL
by June 2008. The actual level was 62 per cent indicating that this part o f the reform
program i s on track (see Annex VI). The Power T A also included the CRI target,
along with a goal o f developing a power sector strategy. While the power sector
strategy was adopted by the Government, and thus the PDO was attained, it has not
been effectively implemented. The Electricity Distribution Rehabilitation Project
includes cost recovery indexes as PDOs for each o f the three major generation
companies. However, recent ISRs do not report the current status o f these CRIs.
3 1.
The DPL was a three tranche operation targeting key policy areas. I t included
conditions designed to ensure that: i)major agencies o f the Government have paid
their electricity bills, ii)Government subsidies have been transferred from the budget,
iii)the Government initiate private sector participation in i t s distribution companies,
and iv) the targets for the CRI have been met. The Government froze electricity
prices in September o f 2006, rather than make a required upward adjustment o f 18
per cent in prices, under grounds that such an increase would only increase theft and
non-payment. As petroleum prices continued to rise, the Government budget for
paying subsidies to the electricity providers was insufficient. Rather than make the
necessary payments, the Government accumulated arrears with the generating
companies. The result i s an accumulated deficit o f over $400 million owed to these
companies, and the companies being unable to provide sufficient power for the grid,
and periodically imposing blackouts.
32.
The release o f the first and second tranches was undertaken with waivers
because o f non-compliance with the tariff formula. The last tranche o f the loan was
cancelled in 2009 because o f failure to reach agreement on outstanding issues on
tariffs, plus the non-payment o f Government arrears to generators, and a failure to
move further on privatization.
33.
The power sector continues to face major problems. A large number o f
subsidies continue to exist for small and medium size consumers that could be
reduced or focused on the poor. Theft and illegal connections, as well as a culture o f

“non-payment”, continue to plague the system. The Government passed an Anti-Theft
Law, but the law i s not being fully enforced because the required implementing
regulations have never been produced. Because o f these problems, and the uncertain
and quixotic nature o f Government regulation, private investors have pulled out o f the
transmissioddistribution, and are unlikely to return unless regulation improves. One
chronic problem remains the lack o f an Energy Ministry and a single clear entity
making energy policy. As a result, a host o f actors are involved and chaos results.

C. Achieving Greater Social Equity

34.
Poverty remains high despite rapid growth, and inequality remains
entrenched due to insufficient progress on the social agenda. Poverty rates were
s t i l l above the pre-crisis levels when measured in 2006. Overall poverty has declined
7 percentage points (2004-06), but s t i l l 36 per cent o f Dominicans were found to be
living in poverty in 2006, and 13 percent in extreme poverty.

The DR does not perform well on many social indicators, particularly
when compared to the LCR average, o r to the average of lower middle income
countries (see Tables 2 and 3). The DR has lower levels o f school enrollment,
primary and secondary, when compared to the LCR average or the average of lower
middle income countries. Primary school enrollment (net), at 77 per cent in 2006 i s
well below the LCR average o f 94 per cent, and secondary school enrollment at 52
per cent i s well below the L C R average o f 70 per cent. Even more worrisome i s the
decline in school enrollment since the crisis. Child and infant mortality i s slightly
above the L C R average, but this might be explained by the fact that DR has lower
than average income. Compared to other lower middle income countries, the DR does
comparatively well on child and infant mortality. On water and sanitation, however,

i t does better than even the LCR average, with access to improved water source at

improved performance in infrastructure does not seem to be reflected in above
average health statistics. Public spending on health care and education has increased
slightly but remains far below regional averages.

A ten-year plan for Health Sector Reform and a mid-term reform agenda
to improve health service quality and accelerate the implementation of the
General Health and Social Security Laws were put in place in 2006. Rigorous
implementation o f these laudable reforms should result in improvements in service
quality, reductions in out-of-pocket expenditure, and increased consumer satisfaction.
The Bank’s Health APL (FY04) initially focused on providing support to meet the
MDGs in health, namely reduced child and infant mortality. The project underwent a
major restructuring in 2006 that refocused the project on funding health services in
poor areas, decentralizing services to the provinces, and an increasing the enrollment
o f the poor in health services. The loan has been instrumental in improving financial
management, public access to information, and procurement procedures in the
Ministry o f Health. I t generally has been rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory
in i t s ability to reach i t s development objectives. The Ministry o f Health has generally
been more willing than other ministries to implement the national legislation on
public sector reform, including the introduction o f improved monitoring and
evaluation.

37.
In terms o f project PDOs, the percent o f primary health facilities in prioritized
areas was projected to go from 0% in 2007 to 50% by the end o f 2008. The other
PDOs are under discussion or data i s not yet available.

38.
In addition, parts o f a $25 million HIV/AIDS project from FYOl were
disbursed during the CAS period; this project closed at the end o f FY08. The project
69

FYI 0-1 3 Country Partnership Strateq.for the Dominican Republic

Auaust 12, 2009

supported the Government’s national H I V / A I D S awareness and treatment program,
and was considered moderately satisfactory in reaching i t s development objectives,
which included increased coverage o f testing and treatment. Procurement, however,
was moderately unsatisfactory. However, it met or exceeded all five o f i t s PDOs,
including those for increased coverage and treatment.
In addition, the Region manages the Global Alliance Food Fortification
39.
Project (GAIN DR), a recipient executed grant o f $1.8 million in which the Ministry
o f Health, in collaboration with the private sector and other public agencies, receives
assistance to fortify staple foods with key vitamins and oligoelements (such as iron
and Vitamin A). The Bank also provides non-lending technical assistance to help
introduce results based financing for the public regional networks o f health care
providers.
Dominican primary school enrollment rates are high but retention and
40.
completion are low. Throughout the system, the quality o f education i s very low
-well below regional and international standards. Despite almost universal
coverage in primary education, secondary school enrollment represents a real
“bottleneck “ in the system as enrollment rates drop drastically at the secondary level.
The l o w enrollment in secondary school education hampers the ability o f the DR to
produce a labor force with the necessary skills to compete in a global economy, The
Youth Development Project (FY06) provides support for improving the employability
o f poor at-risk youth by building their work experience and l i f e skills, and expanding
second change education programs to complete their formal education. The project
has faced serious delays due to insufficient allocations o f local funds in the budget,
and difficulties in arranging procurement for the j o b training centers, including
difficulties in ensuring that bidding documents and procurement followed Bank
guidelines. Consequently the project has been rated moderately unsatisfactory in both
implementation progress and development objectives.

The Early Childhood Education project seeks to improve both access and
41.
quality o f pre-school education and ensure that the poor benefit from this opportunity.
The project has experienced lower than expected disbursements and slow
implementation progress, particularly in the area o f civil works. As o f June 2008 (the
original closing date), the project had disbursed only $18 million o f a total o f $42
million, and the closing date has been extended to December 200921 . In order to
enable the project to adapt to unforeseen cost increases, improve project monitoring,
and permit flexibility in procurement and financial management to facilitate the
achievement o f project goals, an amendment to the Loan Agreement was completed,
and the project underwent a first-order restructuring (approved by the board on
October 10, 2008). Despite the slow implementation progress, the project
development objectives are thought to remain achievable. PDO indicators show
substantial progress in meeting most PDOs, suggesting that the project will reach i t s
PDOs by the time i t closes.
I n 2005, the Government launched a new conditional cash transfer social
42.
assistance program, Solidaridad. I t aims to transfer cash to 300,000 poor
Dominicans, conditioned on households sending their children to school and bringing
2’

As o f December 2008, $21 million has been disbursed.

70

FYIO-13 Countrv Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Republic

August 12, 2009

them to health clinics for vaccinations and check-ups. The money i s distributed via a
debit card, or tarjeta. Solidaridad represents an important shift away from universal
social assistance programs but requires a rigorous monitoring system to be effective.
While designed as a conditional cash transfer program, in fact the program runs as an
unconditional transfer, because the Government lacks the ability to check on
compliance with conditions
The Bank i s helping improve the coverage o f the program through its
43.
Social Protection Investment Project (FY07). This project i s designed to help
improve the targeting, coverage o f the country’s social protection programs, including
the Solidaridad program. This project’s major expenditures are to provide identity
papers for up to 200,000 Dominicans who lack birth certificates, and are therefore not
eligible for the Solidaridad program, for subsidized health care, or for public
education beyond the seventh grade. This project was approved in August 2007, but
only became effective in December 2008. The latest ISR does not report progress on
PDO indicators. A remaining problem, outside the scope o f this project, i s the large
number o f illegal Haitian immigrants working in the bateyes (sugar plantations).

44.
The Government’s subsidy o f electricity and propane gas consumption,
estimated at 2.5 percent o f GDP in 200522 continues to benefit the non-poor
disproportionately, as do subsidies for pharmaceuticals and food di~tribution~~.
Overall, both social assistance programs and tax structure, including a wide range o f
exemptions, remain regressive despite the fiscal reforms of 2005 and 2006.
11.

The Bank Contribution Toward CAS Objectives

Overview

45.
The CAS proposed to support the attainment o f i t s objectives with a lending
program o f $260 million in the base case (plus $15 million from GEF)24, and with a
low case o f $1 10 million and a high case o f $360 million. Through FY09, the Bank
lent $194 million, somewhere between the low case and the base case, and the
composition o f the lending differed significantly from that proposed in the CAS (see
Table 4)25. In addition, this total includes $80 million for the Emergency Recovery
and Disaster Management Project (ERL), which was not included in the original CAS
program. Without the ERL, the total for lending would be $1 14 million, roughly
equal to the original CAS low case (see Fig. 1).

22 This includes both direct subsidies (e.g., for propane gas and the Programa para la Reduccidn de
Apagones, or PRA) as well as Government transfers to cover electricity sector deficits.
23 The subsidy on propane gas was eliminated in the latter half o f 2008. .
24 Not including a Carbon Finance proposal.
25 None o f the GEF operations were approved.

The lending program was severely impacted by the freeze imposed by the
Government on new lending, required by the IMF limit on new debt. Thus, only one
loan was made in FY05, and none in FY06. The proposed Social Sector investment
Loan was divided into two operations, the Youth and Development Project (FY06)
and the Social Protection Investment Loan (FY08). The Institutional Development
TA, which was to support public sector reforms, was dropped (although a substitute
project called Governance and Competitiveness has been proposed to replace it). The
GEF and the carbon finance operations never went forward due to lack o f
Government interest and the lack o f Bank resources to do the preparation work.
47.
The Water and Sanitation APL-1, originally proposed for FY07, was finally
approved in FY09. Thus, while the CAS had a proposed base case lending program
o f 10 projects, only five projects were actually approved. However, o f the 10
operations proposed in the CAS, only three came about as planned, since one project
was an emergency project (ERL), and another proposed project was divided into two.

48.
The “freeze” made clear Government priorities; there was interest in an
operation focused on youth development, because o f a serious youth unemployment
problem recognized by the Government, but not for borrowing for technical
assistance to further public sector reform. The Emergency Recovery and Disaster
Management Project ($80 million, FY08) fulfilled a special request to provide
assistance to repair the infrastructure damages from two tropical storms which struck
the island in the Fall o f 2007. Despite the supposed urgency o f the loan, which was
approved in May 2008, it became effective a year later (May, 2009) after the
Congressional approval was obtained in March 2009. At the same time, important
progress was made in some sectors using operations that carried over from the
previous CAS. The most important o f these was the Health APL from FY03, the
Power Sector DPL (FY 05 $150 million), and a Power Sector Technical Assistance
Loan (FY05 $7.3 million). ’These last two loans became effective during the CAS
73

FYI0-13 Country Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Reuublic

August 12, 2009

period, because o f the long delay common in DR between loan approval and
effectiveness.
Country Relations

49.
As noted in the 2003 CAE, the level o f country relations between the Bank
and the Dominican Republic has always been somewhat problematic. The
Government values the quality o f Bank advice on technical matters, such as
electricity/power, but i s less open to advice in areas that are politically sensitive, such
as public sector accountability and transparency. The opening o f a World Bank office
in Santo Domingo in 1999 has helped the dialogue process, and the Bank made
unique contributions explicitly supporting the outcry for a prosecution o f the
principals in the 2003 bank fraud case, and in helping to implement the Public
Information Law. Some works o f ESW received high marks from the authorities,
particularly the 2005 Poverty Assessment. The latter’s success stemmed from
willingness by the Bank to take a collaborative effort with local academics and
Government officials, and to avoid debates over numbers by focusing on policy
issues.
1.7

Civil Society

50.
Civil society organizations are numerous in the Dominican Republic, and are
active in such areas as health, education, micro-credit, and environment. They have
been useful in the implementation o f the Transparency Law, and in monitoring
elections. They have been effective partners in implementing projects, such as the
HIVIAIDS and the Early Childhood Education projects. However, they have been
less effective as a force pushing for accountability and transparency in Government
operations, or exposing corruption. Except for business groups, Dominican CSOs
have only a limited involvement in economic policy making, at either the executive or
legislative level. W h i l e CSOs are stronger now than in the past, they s t i l l have
weaknesses in terms o f internal management and administration, do not coordinate
well between themselves, and often lack democratic structures.26
1.8

Implementation Issues

Project implementation continues to be an issue. Projects in the Dominican
5 1.
Republic have unusually long effectiveness delays, averaging 17 months for current
projects (see Table 5)27. Part o f the problem stems from the requirement that new
debt obligations be ratified by the Dominican Congress before they can become
effective (i.e. they are treated as international treaties). However, often the
Government i t s e l f i s very slow in sending new projects to the Congress, and the
Congress i s not always in session.

Pimentel, Juan Luis, “Mapeo de Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil en l a Republica Domincana ”
Inter-American Development Bank, Dec. 3 1, 1997.
Note that standard Bank calculations of effectiveness delays are misleading, since they include the
delays ofprojects that are not yet effective. On this basis the effectiveness delay for DR would be only
14 months, compared to 6.4 months for LCR as a whole calculated on the same basis.

Some o f these effectiveness delays can be traced to the freeze on new lending
during 2006, and the run up to the 2008 elections. However, at the same time the
Government froze new lending from the Bank and others, it was proceeding with i t s
Santo Domingo Metro project. Thus, it would seem that Bank projects had a low
priority. Effectiveness delays also were common before the freeze, as well as after.
The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project, which was supposed to
respond to emergency reconstruction for the hurricanes in October-November o f
2007, was declared effective on M a y 6th, 2009 (although 40% can be used to cover
retroactive payments). Projects take longer than expected to become effective. The
result i s a portfolio o f projects with major implementation delays. For instance, the
Social Protection Investment Loan was approved by the Board in August o f 2007.
The project assumed that the loan would begin disbursing in the first quarter o f
FY2008, but the loan only became effective in December 2008, 16 months after
approval.
53.
I n addition to effectiveness delays, Bank projects in the Dominican
Republic experience disbursement delays, both compared with project expectations
and with L C R Regional averages. The disbursement ratio (October 2008) was 3.2%
o f the portfolio, compared to a L C R average o f 8.3%28. As shown in Table 5, the
average project has a disbursement delay o f about 50% -- that is, current
disbursements are only half o f what was expected.

54.
However, few projects are considered “at risk”. The portfolio as o f October
2008 consisted o f 9 projects for $408 million, o f which only one, with a value o f 5%
o f the total portfolio, was considered “at risk”. This i s better performance that the

L C R average which shows 19% o f commitments at risk. The combination o f slow
disbursement and l o w numbers o f projects at risk, in an otherwise risky environment,
may reflect greater care exercised by Bank staff in identifying problems and
enforcing Bank procurement and financial management guidelines.

55.
The combination of effectiveness and disbursement delays results in the
need to extend projects past their anticipated closing date. The average project
extension i s about 13 months, and few projects are completed without an extension29.
In contrast, Bank norms suggest that extensions should be given only in exceptional

circumstance^^^.

56.
Procurement problems are common, and include inadequate project
contracting and supervision (Early Childhood), delays occasioned by the need to
conform bidding documents to Bank standards (Youth Development), lack o f
capacity o f bidders to comply with Bank requirements (Health APL), delays in
submitting procurement documents for no objection (Youth Development),
misprocurement (HIV/AIDS) and problems developing TORS for studies (Power
TA). Other problems include weak HR management (Health APL), and inadequate
budget resources (Youth Development).
57.
A recent review of the Bank's portfolio undertaken with Dominican
These
counterparts identified a number of issues in project implernentati~n~~.
include: a need to communicate better with Congress the urgency o f project approval,
including project purposes and goals; the need for better monitoring o f projects by
Government authorities with the objective o f identifying bottlenecks; taking steps to
reduce the turnover o f staff in PIUs; improvements in the coordination between
Treasury (Hacienda) and the Ministry o f Economy, Planning and Development,
particularly in the assignment o f budgetary counterpart funds to support projects. The
review noted that some delays were caused b y having small public works elements in
human resource projects, which were not suitable for competitive bidding, and that
some Bank projects had multiple execution units, which causes problems o f
coordination o f procurement. Other problems were identified, including the need for
training o f P I U staff in Bank procurement procedures. There i s also a need for a better
realism in rating project performance.

Economic and Sector Work

58.
During the CAS period, the Bank delivered several important ESW reports,
including a Poverty Assessment ('joint with IDB), a Country Fiduciary Assessment
('joint with IDB), and a CEM. Annex table V I gives details on the dissemination
efforts attached to ESW produced during 2007-2009. Most major reports have been
translated into Spanish and 'disseminated via the press, and through meetings with
Government officials and in academic circles. The C E M was one o f the few reports
not translated into Spanish. The Poverty Report was widely disseminated throughout

A set o f Policy Notes covering key sectors i s under preparation and expected
to be delivered in FY09. A new C E M covering the island o f Hispanola would be
delivered in FY10. The Bank i s also providing important non-lending support o f a
more informal nature to assist in the national strategic planning effort, and in the past
has provided support for urban transport analysis, agriculture, and a rural assessment.
The Dominican Republic was also included in two regional efforts: one on Growth,
Trade and Competiveness (FY05), and another on Crime and Violence in the

IFC Activities

60.
During the FYOS-FYOS CAS period, IFC’s strategy focused on enhancing
the competitiveness o f the private sector, supporting projects generating growth, and
contributing towards greater social equity. IFC’s interventions concentrated in areas
where the country has a competitive advantage or that are hard currency earners o f
the economy-tourism, and free trade zone (notably developing inward linkages
towards the local economy); and human resources development (health and
education). Other important areas included infrastructure and renewable energy.
During the financial crisis in the DR, IFC’s program focused on restoring confidence
in the private sector in order to improve the country’s competitiveness and contribute
towards greater social equity.

As the country made headways in accessing capital markets, and liquidity
increased, I F C emphasized long-tenor financing, difficult to access for most private
sector companies. I F C built long-term partnerships and helped improve market
access for micro, small and medium scale entrepreneurs and leading companies using
both investment and advisory products: i)at the country level by working on key
the business climate, strengthening infrastructure, improving
sectors-improving
access to finance and promoting sustainability; and ii) at the company level by
understanding client needs, ensuring efficient delivery, imparting global
knowledge/best practices and innovation.
62.
In FY05-FY08, I F C committed a total o f US$200 million for i t s own account,
and mobilized additional US$59 million in B loans from commercial banks and
US$40 million from Export Development Canada (EDC) - for an overall total o f
US$299 million in mandated financing. These investments supported 12 projects: 3
in the financial sector (US$40 million - US$6 million in trade financing, US$1
million in microfinance, and US$33 million in commercial banking), 2 in electricity
(US$43 million - US$20 million in power transmission, and US$23 million in wind
power), 4 in infrastructure (US$138 million - U S $ l l 7 million in airports, and US$21
million in ports), and 3 in general manufacturing and services (US$78 million US$7.5 million in cement, and US$70 million in tourism).
63.
As o f June 30, 2008, IFC's committed and outstanding portfolio was
US$257.1 million and US$232.4 million respectively (see Table 7).

Advisory work under Doing Business has stimulated resolute actions b y the
Dominican Competitiveness Council-for example, the number o f days to start a
business in the country was reduced from 73 to 22 days in 2007. As a result, the DR

MIGA’s exposure in the Dominican Republic has fallen slightly since end2006 when it stood at US$157.3 million (equivalent to 2.9% o f MIGA’s portfolio) to
US$124.7 million (equivalent to 1.9% o f MIGA’s portfolio) as o f December 3 1, 2009
(see Table 8). Over the late 1990’s and early 2000’s MIGA was active in the DR in
both the tourism and the power sector through the provision o f guarantees to
financiers in these two sectors. As a result o f the amortization o f the loans to support
those projects, MIGA’s exposure gradually began to decline. However, since FY06
MIGA has been guaranteeing the Santo Domingo-Samana toll road (which accounts
for the increase in exposure from FY05 to FY06), as well as exploring other projects
in the transportation sector which have yet to materialize.

Conclusions

To recapitulate and recast, the CAS
69.
had three objectives:
Economic stability and promoting a
climate for growth;
0

0
Public sector reform and reduction in
corruption; and

Improvements
targeted to the poor.
0

in

social

services

On the first objective, the country succeeded in restoring economic stability, and
growth reached record levels. While the Bank played some role in helping to restore
the health o f the banking system, i t s influence overall was marginal.

70.
Public sector reform was considered the “overarching” objective, but again
the Bank’s contribution was marginal, particularly when compared to the emphasis
this was given in the CAS. The Government enacted some reforms, but they did not
support fundamental reforms, and failed to implement much o f the new legislation
that was passed. In hindsight, the Bank did probably as much as it could under the
80

FY10-13 Countw Partnershiu Stratem for the Dominican Reuublic

August 12, 2009

circumstances; the window o f opportunity seen at the time o f drafting the CAS was
not available. In the power sector, which i s both growth and public sector oriented,
some reforms were carried out, but fundamental problems s t i l l remain. O n the third,
Government has proven to be reluctant to accept fundamental reforms which go
against i t s political instincts. In the social services, the Bank has been more
successful. Its operations in education and health seem relatively successful, both in
terms o f improving services but also in terms o f improved public sector
administration.

71.

Another criterion would be to judge to what degree it addressed the problems
laid out in the 2003 C A E (see box 1). The C A E suggested four areas for focus:
0

Improving country dialogue;
Focusing on the MDGs;
Broadening the structural reform agenda;
Improving the power sector,

72.
The Bank has made an attempt to improve country dialogue, and i t s influence
i s stronger now than before 1999. The Bank has focused on meeting the MDGs,
particularly in health, education, and HIV/AIDs. I t has not had much success
broadening the sectoral reform agenda, and given i t s limited resources i s probably
better o f f focusing o n those areas having a clear comparative advantage. Finally, it
has made a major effort to address the policy and capacity constraints in the power
sector, but with limited results. While capacity has increased through the TA project,
there i s s t i l l lack o f Government commitment to follow recommendations based on
international experiences.
1.11

Lessons for a F u t u r e Country Strategy

73.

Any future strategy will have to decide where the Bank’s comparative
advantage lies, particularly given that it i s not the biggest or most important
donor/source o f finance. The following are some key lessons that seem to emerge
from this CAS completion review:
0

Keep focused o n a few key sectors where there i s some potential for success
and where Bank advice i s appreciated (if not always followed): education,
health, safety nets, and power.

0

Set realistic objectives, and avoid objectives that are unrealistic in the country
context even if they are ideologically noble or current (e.g. privatization o f
power utilities). Don’t confuse passage o f laws with Government commitment
and real change on the ground.

0

Chose targets that are realistic and can be measured, and insure that there i s
monitoring o f these targets and periodic reporting. Make sure that projects
also monitor progress toward results and report these in ISRs.

Rethink the approach for dealing with the Energy Sector challenges, ensuring
that additional analysis includes Political Economy dimension and work with
other donors on this agenda.

81

FYI 0-13 County Partnership Stratem for the Dominican Reuublic

August 12, 2009

W h i l e governance issues remain paramount, it i s important to recognize that
public sector reform i s going to be difficult, and that progress in this area i s
apt to be limited to those ministries (such as Health, Attorney-General) where
officials are already convinced o f the need and willing to undertake reforms
(so called “champions”). The focus should be on maintaining accountability
and transparency in Government operations, including budget formulation and
execution, and improving the voice o f civil society. Performance-based
management and budgeting may be good entry points to foster this agenda.
Use ESW to focus on intractable problems like corruption, drugs, money
laundering, crime and violence, public sector reform. Conduct ESW
cooperatively with partners in country, so as to build ownership and local
capacity. Translate all ESW into Spanish and disseminate as widely as
possible.
B e realistic about projecting disbursements, and recognize that major
effectiveness delays are to be expected - and plan accordingly. Be more
candid in ISR ratings.
Strengthen Civil Society capacity to build constituency for the reform.
Engage with Congress for dealing with complex development challenges in
the country.
Strengthen donor coordination by mapping donor’s interventions and priority
areas as well as aligning efforts for Policy Reform.

Annex 7: Governance in the Dominican Republic

I.GOVERNANCE
ACCOUNTABILITYFRAMEWORK
The governance environment in the Dominican Republic (DR) i s complex and
singled out by many as one o f the country’s main overarching obstacles for
achieving a sustainable, equitable and inclusive growth. The latest U S A I D assessment
on democracy and governance in the DR (April 2007) concluded that the country faces a
problem o f good governance, one o f i t s main causes being an “overly powerful executive
branch confronted by too few checks and balances.” Similar findings are underscored in
the UNDP’s 2008 Dominican Republic Human Development Report, pointing to
weaknesses in the rule o f law, l o w levels o f transparency and access to public
information, access to opportunities determined by personal and group power and the
predominance o f patronage relations in politics. Many argue that the issue o f Dominican
corruption represents one o f the greatest obstacles to a more participatory and
representative democracy. Since the bank failures and economic crises that began in
2002, Dominican society i s more acutely aware o f the issue and the gravity o f the
problem
I n Dominican Republic the President exercises great influence over the other
branches and levels o f Government. The Trujillo regime that lasted 30 years has l e f t a
strong legacy o f personalized and de-institutionalized Government decision making32.
Dominican presidentialism not only rests on the powers given b y the Constitution, but
also on the tradition o f paternalism. Formally, the Congress does have i t s own
constitutional source o f independent authority that could provide certain fundamental
checks on executive power. However, most analysts o f executive-legislative relations
concur that in practice, as it happens in other countries o f the region, Congress does not
exercise i t s role as a check and balance to executive power.
Despite recent modernization efforts, the effectiveness o f the country’s
accountability institutions -including Congress, the Anticorruption Office, the
Chamber o f Accounts and Regulatory Agencies- i s still very low. L a w 423-06
increased the type and detail o f budget information that the Executive i s mandated to
present before Congress in i t s budget proposal. For instance, a preliminary report on the
macro-economic and fiscal forecasts and the expected economic and financial results as
well as a multi-annual forecast must be included (PEFA 2007). According to the 2007
PEFA, “there are no predetermined procedures for the budget review performed b y the
legislative branch, but Congress’ Planning and Budget Commission analyses the budget
from a geographical perspective and makes recommendations to the plenary session”.
The DR has scores 11 out o f 100 points in the 2008 Open Budget Index developed b y the
International Budget Partnership (IBP), amongst the countries providing “scant or no”
information on the budget to the public. Although the Executive’s budget proposal must
be submitted during the second legislature (August 16 th - November 13 th), in practice,
the Executive’s budget proposal arrives in the last week o f December. Therefore, the
document i s not known by the public until i t s approval.

FY10-13 County Partnershio Stratem for the Dominican Reoublic

August 12, 2009

Congress has embarked in a modernization process that includes management
reforms aimed at streamlining its organizational design, bylaws, personnel system,
and communications, as well as institutional reforms for improving its capacity for
budget analysis and tracking. During 2007-2008, U N D P has supported the House o f
Representatives in setting up a Division for Budget Analysis and Design, which i s
currently operational (with personnel being hired through a merit-based system) and
offering technical advice to four House committees (Budget, Public Debt, Fiscal, and
Accounts Committees). The Senate’s (art. 5) and the House’s (art. 7) bylaws, however,
mandate the creation o f a bicameral office with the purpose o f providing sound
legislative analysis to both chambers. This office has yet to be created. The development
o f legislative analytical capacities, particularly referred to financial management and
budget performance, as well as the streamlining o f Congress’s information system would
enable better compliance by Congress o f i t s oversight mandate in an appropriate manner.
The Chamber of Accounts (Chmara de Cuentus) has undergone through a prolonged
legitimacy crisis. In order for the Chamber to fulfill i t s mandate, the PEFA report says
that i t needs to be strengthened at two levels: first, by improving their capacity to produce
special audits (called “financial audits” in the DR, and “compliance audits”
internationally) that truly assess financial transactions beyond mere accounting reviews;
and second, since the recommendations o f the Chamber o f Accounts in the final reports
are o f mandatory compliance (Law 10-04, Art. 39) by the audited agency, other
stakeholders such as Congress and civil society organizations should develop capacities
to ensure that these recommendations are really followed. The Executive’s
Anticorruption Office (Direccion de Persecucion de la Corrupcion Administrativa) under
the Attorney General’s Office has been elevated in i t s administrative hierarchy and i t s
mandate has been delimited to the investigation o f corruption and the control o f public
officials’ assets declarations. This, however, has not been supported sufficient budgetary
allocations.
Civil society has played a major role in raising awareness about the problems of
corruption, weak governance and accountability. Since the early 1990s, civil society
has progressively strengthened i t s voice in the policymaking process, particularly by
fostering public debate and influencing decision-making through concrete policy
proposals around key public interest issues such as poverty reduction, state reforms and
transparency. However, civil society organizations are s t i l l lacking the capacity to
mobilize grassroots movements thought out the country. The weave o f civil society
organizations i s strong both at the national and the sub-national levels, but only a few
have been able to develop capacities for monitoring Government performance and
transparency. An Access to Information law was enacted in 2006 although it has not been
fully implemented for the lack o f demand-side involvement. Nevertheless, in the last few
years some coalitions have been formed aimed at strengthening their voice and influence
in public affairs. The Civil Society Consultative Council -representing a wide range o f
CSOs- i s currently monitoring social policies -which account for 44 percent o f the
country’s expenditures- and regularly interacts with the Government’s “social cabinet”.
These organizations are also part o f the “Citizen Forum” (Foro Ciudadano) which
comprises more than 200 CSOs spread out through the country. The Forum has publicly
denounced the impunity o f several corruption cases, and has also put forward proposals
for increasing transparency and access to information. Some CSOs have lately started to

104

focus on monitoring the public budget, particularly the national budget and the
allocations to social expenditures.
All of the above hamper development effectiveness o f Government interventions
resulting in suboptimal policy outcomes. A Congress relatively weak, especially in
term o f i t s oversight capacity, undermines representation on the allocation o f resources
and allows expenditure deviations from what was originally in the public budget. The
presence o f a not well articulated civil society with technical weaknesses add to the
uncertainty o f the policy making process which tend to be dominated by the interest o f
the presidency. The Bank’s portfolio performance i s hampered b y these weaknesses,
especially in the area o f disbursement due to lack o f coordination between planning and
budgeting.

11. RECENT
PROGRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT’S
REFORM AGENDA.
Partly as a result of the mounting concerns raised during the electoral campaign,
but also accelerated by the worsening of economic conditions due to the financial
crisis, the Fernandez administration convened a national dialogue aimed at reaching
consensus on a National Development Strategy. Despite signs o f skepticism around the
Government’s real commitment to change, the dialogue convened broad participation
from dozens o f public, nonprofit and private organizations and umbrella groups. The
roundtables convened around a broad l i s t o f topics concluded their work with a l i s t o f
proposals which had to be approved b y the Executive’s representatives that were part o f
each roundtable. Institutional strengthening and transparency were transversal issues that
emerged as central concerns in all the roundtables as indicated by the final Rapporteur’s
summary. Among the transparency measures included in the proposal, i t i s noteworthy to
mention: increasing budget transparency and expenditures’ publication according to their
classification and components; increasing the transparency o f the Chamber o f Accounts
(Camara de Cuentas) b y creating the access to information office and strengthening the
mechanisms for the implementation o f the Access to Information Law.
I n the last few years the Government has passed important reforms33that redefine
the role of the institutions involved in the planning and budgeting process. The
Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Economy, Planning and Development SEEPYD- have been established with a stronger mandate to regulate and manage
resource allocation and budget flows in detriment o f the Presidential Office. The 1401
fund o f the Presidency34has been eliminated, the discretional use o f revenue surpluses
has been regulated and the implementation o f a financial management information
system has been enforced. SEEPYD, SEH and the Secretary o f Public Service are s i ning
result agreements with the Secretary o f Labor, Agriculture, Education and Health for
the 2010 Budget.

f5

33

Examples of these laws are: 2006 Organic law on the Public Sector Budget, 2006 Creation o f State
Secretariats for Treasury and Economy, Planning and Development, 2007 Financial Administration System
o f the State law, 2006 Public credit law, 2006 Planning and Investment law, 2006 Government
Procurement and Contracting law, 2007 Establishment o f the Internal Control System law
34 The 1401 Fund was a discretionary spending h n d fed by revenue surpluses creating the incentive to
underestimate revenue as a way to increase discretionary expenditure.
35
These secretaries were picked on the basis o f their technical and infrastructure capacity to define and
follow up performance indicators.

105

FYI 0-13 Country Partnershlu Stratem.for the Dominican Reuublic

August 12, 2009

This new public financial management framework paves the way for the adoption o f
a medium-term expenditure framework and the use o f performance information to
improve the quality o f public spending. Progress made in the implementation o f the
2006 Organic law i s already improving the budget’s credibility, predictability and control
fueled by recent tax reforms and the positive performance o f the economy in the period
2005-2007. The budget now identifies transfers and projects o f decentralized agencies
and the deviation between what i s in the budget and what i s financed by it has been
reduced. The Debt L a w has improved debt managing and transparency. In the past, line
ministries would go directly to Congress to introduce loan without any consideration for
debt sustainability. The investment and planning-related laws have strengthened control
o f Government investment and it i s improving i t s allocation on the basis o f technical
criteria, investment information i s being systematized in the Public Investment National
System and investment i s being prioritized following institutional plans and territorial
need. The Government i s preparing the National Development Strategy and the MultiAnnual Public Investment Plan.
Nevertheless, many o f these reforms are still too recent and support i s needed to
avoid backtracks in the light o f the international financial crisis. Several challenges
lay ahead and further improvements in public financial management are s t i l l needed such
as the presentation o f financial information, non-financial data for the public sector level,
and improved financial statements, the development o f an operational efficiency capacity
beyond legal compliance, encompassing performance accountability in the provision o f
services and measurable improvements in budget transparency (PEFA 2007). With
assistance from the Bank and the USAID, the Government has put in place a task force to
address the governance challenges.

Challenges and Opportunities
Nevertheless, many o f these reforms are still too recent and support i s needed to
avoid backtracks in the light o f the international financial crisis. Several challenges
lay ahead and further improvements in public financial management are s t i l l needed such
as the presentation o f financial information, non-financial data for the public sector level,

beyond legal compliance, encompassing performance accountability in the provision o f

assistance from the Bank and the USAID, the Government has put in place a task force to
address the governance challenges.
This present few risks as - in principle- the executive i s somewhat unconstraint and
unaccountable- however, it also provides some opportunities in the short term to
improve the quality o f public spending and service delivery as there are fewer veto
points and a growing social demand for this. Specifically, in education, health, agriculture
and labor, the pilot Ministries that have agreed to sign performance agreements, there i s
an opportunity to move towards some more explicit contractual relationships between the
line departments and the fundinghegulating central agencies. This would enhance
performance accountability with more explicit understandings about funding and
deliverables in order to improve efficiency and service delivery in key areas, while

106

FYI0-I3 Count? Partnersh@Stratem for the Dominican Republic

August 12. 2009

moving gradually the attention to strengthening the capacity o f Congress, the SA1 and the
public at large to use performance information to undertake their oversight function.

The Bank strategy i s aligned with the National Development Strategy that calls for
strengthening institutions at the national and regional levels, better quality o f public
expenditures, public security, good governance, and the development o f a culture o f
results within the public administration. From the lending side the Bank has: (i)a
Programmatic DPL on Performance and Accountability o f Social Sectors - which
includes a component to support a series o f reforms to build a culture o f results in public
administration, (ii)a Municipal Development Investment Loan, which will include
institutional development activities to strengthening capacity o f local Governments and a
(iii)Health Sector Reform Loan (PARSS 11) - which includes a series o f actions to
support performance based management within the health sector. From the AAA side the
Bank has (i)Quality o f Public Expenditures NLTA, which will focus on improving the
quality o f public expenditures in the DR by strengthening financial management and
procurement mechanisms and strengthening the oversight capacity o f various actors36;(ii)
an Institutional and Governance Review (ESW) which w i l l focus on underlying political
economy and governance issues that prevent the country from addressing fundamental
development challenges in key sectors like education, health, and energy; and (iii)A set
o f safeguards capacity building activities, to offer assistance to the Dominican Republic
to manage social and environmental opportunities and risks at a strategic level, for which
analytical work and technical assistance w i l l support the Dominican Republic in
strengthening its norms and institutions to incorporate management o f the Bank’s
safeguards policies as well as other international good practice frameworks in a
coordinated manner.
I n sum, the proposed approach for Bank engagement in Dominican Republic
focuses on two lines o f activity- building on the recent improvements within the
executive while improving governance constraints on the executive. This means,
leveraging on the recently approved reforms and ongoing initiatives to enhance
performance accountability between the line departments and the fundinghegulating
central agencies in the short term. Similarly, it i s important to continue providing Bank’s
support to strengthen the wider governance environment in the long term, in the areas o f
access to information, external audit and Congress

This multisectoral NLTA includes the development o f a National Procurement Strategy, the application
o f the OECD Indicators on procurement, technical assistance to SEEPyD, Finance and Public
Administration, and the support to the DR Supreme Audit Institution. Activities on this front are closely
coordinated with the IDB, the UNDP, and the European Commission, which i s already supporting the
Secretary o f Public Administration with 8 million Euros.

Annex 9 : Country Financing Parameters
Country Financing Parameters

During the 2007 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR), the Government
requested amendment o f the Country Financing Parameters (CFP) for the Dominican
Republic to raise the Bank’s financing cost-share from 90 to 100 percent. The impetus
for this change stems from a series o f new laws that establish a framework o f efficient
resource management and accountability in the Government’s budgeting process.37
Within this new framework, the Government intends to align current budgeting standards
on programming, budgeting, and administration with international standards. These new
laws w i l l also, among other measures, limit discretionary presidential and extrabudgetary spending, and eventually engender a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning,
expenditure policy and budgeting.
In the past two years there has been a track record o f adequate and timely allocation o f
counterpart funds. In addition, a very positive outcome from the implementation o f the
new Treasury Law reduced the time it took for the cycle o f transferring Bank proceeds
from the Central Bank to the projects’ own operating accounts from 45 to 9 days. Based
on improvements in this cycle, which have effectively sped up project execution, the
Bank authorized, in May 2007, using advances as another disbursement method for new
projects and now the borrower i s allowed to open Designated Accounts.
In the 2005 CAS, the Government and the Bank agreed to limit the Bank’s financing
share to 90 percent o f project costs, the rationale being to provide additional safeguards
for Bank resources in light o f inefficient and opaque budget management processes in
place at the time, as well as to provide a signal o f Government ownership and
commitment. It was expected that, over time, the Bank’s average financing share would
increase as budget mechanisms improved with the passing and implementation o f the
new laws and a track record o f adequate and timely allocation o f counterpart funds was
established.

The newly strengthened budget processes obviate the need for these safeguards (Le., less
than 100 percent Bank financing), and the lending program proposed in this CAS
Progress Report reflects close consultation with the Government on their priorities and
includes project-specific triggers designed to ensure Government commitment. Raising
the CFP to 100 percent would also alleviate existing constraints to implementing Bank
projects. The new budget laws have in effect eliminated the previous flexibility to
incorporate a budget line item for contingencies that was used for counterpart funds. As
a result, the deadline for including projects in the annual budget i s September 30th, and
the deadline for reviewing the budgets for active projects i s July 15th; with no line item
for contingency, and the additional restriction o f including only approved projects in the
budget, there i s little flexibility to integrate counterpart funding for projects pending
approval, This means that all projects ratified by Congress after July 15th in any given
year stand little chance o f receiving counterpart funding until a new budget i s prepared 12
months later, effectively delaying implementation by 18 months.
The three laws promulgated in November and December 2006 that affect the budgeting process are: i)
Law 498-06 on Public Planning and Investment, ii)Law 496-06 creating the State Secretariat o f Economy,
Planning and Development, and iii) Law 423-06 on Organic Budget for the Public Sector.

In addition to accelerating project implementation, the resulting increased flexibility
would allow for more efficient project administration; with the phasing out o f the
traditional pari passu approach, cost sharing needs are no longer determined at the level
o f individual expenditures, thus enabling project teams to focus more on technical aspects
o f projects rather than on financing categories.

There i s no expected impact o f the change in CFP on the portfolio. Projects under
execution will not be affected as the Government has indicated that it will continue
considering counterpart allocations on projects under execution a first priority in the
budget process. Potential impact on the pipeline i s positive for some projects, nil for
others. Projects under preparation will benefit from this flexibility and any counterpart
contribution will be applied on a selective and case-by-case merit/justification.
With the exception o f Cost Sharing, other themes on the CFP, such as Recurrent Cost
Financing and Local Cost Financing, remain unchanged from the original DR CAS o f
May 2005. The composition o f taxes and duties remains largely unchanged, with the
exception o f lower projected tariff revenues in conjunction with the Dominican RepublicCentral American Free Trade Agreement which became effective in March 2007.

Item
A. Cost Sharing
Limit on the proportion o f individual
project costs that the Bank may
finance

Parameter Explanation/Remark
Some individual projects may be
Jp to 100%
financed up to 100%. Financing up to
100% will be applied on a selective
and case-by-case meriVjustification.

B. Recurrent Cost Financing. Any
limits that would apply to the overall
amount o f recurrent expenditures that
the Bank may finance. The two
requirements for Bank financing o f
local expenditures are met. Therefore.
the Bank can finance local

N o country
level limit

The two requirements for Bank
financing o f local expenditures are
met. Therefore, the Bank can finance
local costs in proportions needed in
individual projects

C. Local Cost Financing.
Financing met: (i) financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would exceed the
public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from taxation and
other revenues) and expected domestic
borrowing; and (ii) the financing o f
foreign expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing of individual projects.

Yes

The two requirements for the Bank
financing o f local expenditure are met.
Therefore, the Bank can finance local
costs in the proportion needed in
individual projects.

D. Taxes and Duties.
Are there any taxes and duties that the
Bank would not finance?

None

No taxes or duties are currently
Identified as unreasonable or

discriminatory. At the project level, the
Bank would consider whether taxes
and duties constitute excessively high
share o f eroiect exeenditures.
