COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY PROGRESS REPORT
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) provides a midterm assessment of the implementation of the World Bank’s FY07-10 Malawi Country
Assistance Strategy. The Board o f the Executive Directors discussed the FY07-FY 10
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi on February 13, 2007. The CAS
represents the World Bank’s strategic alignment with the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (2006-1 1) and seeks to support the Government’s effort to achieve
broad-based growth and poverty reduction. Following the IDA 15 replenishment, some
US$260 million w i l l be available to Malawi over FY09 and FY10, a significant increase
on the US$180m envisaged in the CAS.

The primary focus of the CAS has been on growth promotion, enhanced social
2.
protection and the improvement of governance. Despite the changes in the external
environment resulting from the global downturn, this report concludes that the current
strategy remains appropriate. Therefore, no modifications to the CAS results framework
are recommended. In line with the institutional requirements of the CASPR, this report
sets out to: (i)
assess implementation progress during the first two years o f the CAS; (ii)
revisit the strategy on the basis o f implementation experience and lessons learned; (iii)
address opportunities for enhanced IDA programming in the context o f AFR regional
desire for a more ambitious/transformative approach to IDA programs in the face of the
global crisis.

A. BACKGROUND
TO THE FY07-10 CAS
3.
Malawi is a small, densely populated, land-locked country, with one of the
lowest levels of per capita income in the world (US$230 in 2006). In 2005, around 85
percent of the population lived in rural areas, where the majority was engaged in rain-fed
subsistence agriculture. Most people are highly vulnerable to illness, shocks and annual
rainfall volatility, which, in conjunction with poorly developed input and output markets,
has resulted in chronic food insecurity and contributed to widespread malnutrition. The
2006 Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA), based on data from the Integrated
Household Survey ( M S ) of 2005, revealed that Malawi made very little progress in
reducing poverty between 1998 and 2005, and that over half the population (52% or 6.4
million people) was living below the poverty line in 2005.
4.
The Government of President Bingu wa Mutharika came to of$ce in May 2004
and was re-elected in May 2009. The Government has made substantial progress in
pursuing sustainable fiscal policies and maintaining macroeconomic stability. Economic
growth between 1995 and 2005 was low and volatile, averaging 2.7 percent, with annual
population growth of over 2 percent during the same period. Recurrent weather shocks to
smallholder agricultural production and a lack o f investment were compounded by high
inflation, and high nominal and real interest rates, fueled b y poor public expenditure
management. Since taking office, the Government has brought public spending under

1

control and reduced the large public debt. B y 2006, macroeconomic performance had
significantly improved (with interest and inflation rates high but falling), and Malawi had
completed the first and second reviews of an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) agreed in 2005. Malawi reached completion point o f the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HLPC) Initiative in August 2006.
5.
The Government has made fighting corruption a key plunk in its program, and
has achieved results in tackling high-level graf. Perceived corruption in Malawi in
2005 was relatively better than in most low-income countries in Africa.’ However, a key
indicator measuring corruption in Malawi deteriorated over the past decade2. Stepping
up the anti-corruption agenda, between 2004 and 2006 the Anti-Corruption Bureau
(ACB) launched several investigations of high profile persons in government as well as
the opposition, leading to several arrests and convictions.
6.
The long-term vision of the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS)
is to transform Malawifrom a predominantly importing and consuming country into a
predominately producing and exporting country. The MGDS recognizes that strong and
sustainable economic growth i s key to reducing poverty and seeks to achieve growth
rates of at least 6 percent a year. In the medium term, the strategy concentrates on
agriculture as the driver of growth, focusing on increasing agricultural productivity and
integrating smallholder farmers into commercial activities. The document has a strong
focus on results, which has been supported by the World Bank.

7.
The CAS identified three key challenges to the achievement of
Government’s development goals:

the

Pervasive risk at the national and household level resulting primarily from
food insecurity caused by weather-related shocks to agricultural production and
poorly functioning agricultural markets, macroeconomic instability, and illness or
death, especially from HIV/AIDS.
0

0

Private sector development has been constrained by macroeconomic
instability, deficient infrastructure, especially limited and unreliable electricity
supply, a shortage of skilled personnel, expensive and restricted access to credit,
crime and corruption.
Weak institutional capacity. Malawi faces severe human resource constraints in
key sectors, including health and education, due in part to the inability of the
education system to produce sufficient graduates and exacerbated b y the impact
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Malawi’s score on the Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (TICPI) in 2005 was 2.8 out of 10,
compared to the average for other Low Income Countries in Africa (2.5), Mozambique and Madagascar (2.8), Zambia
(2.6), Uganda (2.5), Niger (2.4), Cameroon (2.2) and Ethiopia (2.2).
Malawi’s TICPI went down from 4.1 in 1998 to 2.8 in 2008, though the 2009 index shows improvement
at 3.3.

2

8.

The Results-Based CAS targets four key outcomes:

i.

Improve smallholder agricultural productivity and integration into agroprocessing. (Related MGDS Goal: Medium term economic growth through
small-scale agriculture and agro-processing and food security)

ii.

Put in place a foundation for long-term economic growth through improved
infrastructure and the investment climate. (Related MGDS Goal: Enabling
environment for private sector-led growth and infrastructure)

iii.

Decrease vulnerability at the household level to H I V / A I D S and malnutrition.
(Related MGDS Goal: HN/AIDS and Nutrition)

iv.

Sustain improvements in expenditure management, budget execution, and
the accountability of the civil service. (Related MGDS Goal: Good
Governance)

9.
The CAS is also aligned with the Bank’s regional strategic priorities. The focus
of the CAS on growth, enhanced social protection and improved governance reflects the
four pillars of the Africa Action Plan (AAP): accelerating shared growth; building capable

states; strengthening outcome-based national strategies and the Bank’s focus on results; and
strengthening the global development partnership for Africa. Consistent with the lessons of

the 2007 review o f the AAP, the CAS i s fully aligned with the Government’s Malawi
Growth and Development Strategy, and the Bank i s co-financing five out of eleven
projects in i t s program with other development partners. Further, sector-wide approaches
(SWAps) are in place or under preparation in agriculture, education, infrastructure, water
and sanitation, and public sector management.

B. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAS (FY07-FYOS)
(a) Recent Economic and Political Developments

10.
Malawi’s macroeconomic environment has continued to improve, although
there are substantial risks to the macroeconomic program. Real GDP grew b y 6.7
percent in 2006 and 8.6 percent in 2007, exceeding the 6 percent growth target under the
MGDS projected under the IMF-supported macroeconomic program. Economic growth
in 2008 i s estimated at 9.7 percent. This has partly been the result o f external factors,
such as good rainfall and strong international tobacco prices, but has also been
underpinned by the Government’s continued commitment to prudent fiscal management
and the implementation of a fertilizer subsidy program. However, over-expenditure on
the fertilizer subsidy program in FY09 may put the IMF-supported macroeconomic
program at risk. While there has been little progress on export diversification over the
last two years, this w i l l change with the opening of a uranium mine in 2009 which i s
expected to boost GDP b y 10 percent and exports b y 25 percent.

Malawi reached completion point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative in August 2006 and qualified for the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative. T h i s resulted in a decline in Malawi’s debt-to-exports ratio from 235.3 percent
in 2005 to 40.9 percent in 2006.3 The Government has also continued to reduce the level
of domestic public debt by enforcing strict fiscal discipline, while using increased foreign
flows (from debt relief and budget support), and increased tax revenues, to reduce the
domestic debt stock; domestic debt declined from 16.5 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 11.8
percent at the end o f 2007. However, increased expenditure on the input subsidy program
and on goods and services in recent times has led to an increase in domestic debt, which
shot up to 19.0 percent of GDP in 2008. The country’s dependence on rain-fed
agriculture and on a few agricultural commodities for exports continue to represent
significant risks to debt sustainability. Results o f the October 2009 joint BanWIMF Debt
Sustainability Analysis are expected to shed more light on the country’s medium-term
debt dynamics.
Inflation has remained in single digits since 2007.. Inflation fell into single
12.
digits in January 2007 for the first time since 2003, but rose steadily between June and
December 2008, as a result of the lagged impact o f global oil price rises and seasonal
increases in food prices earlier in the year. However, inflation has trended downward
during 2009, reflecting moderation in food and fuel prices and restrained credit growth.
As o f September 2009, headline inflation was back down to 7.5 percent. Following a
significant reduction in government borrowing and lower inflation rates, the central bank
policy rate has fallen to 15 percent. Commercial bank lending rates have also fallen, and
commercial bank lending to the private sector increased b y 35 percent between January
and September 2008.4
As a share o f GDP, the external debt stock decreased from 108.3 percent in 2005 to 14.4 percent in 2006.
This likely contributed to an increase in private investment from 11.7 percent o f GDP in 2007, to 18.2
percent in 2008.

13.
The nominal exchange rate has been pegged since 2006, which has contributed
to Malawi’s worsening international reserve position. As a result, in 2008, the IMF
reclassified the exchange rate regime as a de facto conventional peg. The fixing of the
domestic currency to the dollar has appreciated the real exchange rate and eroded
Malawi’s international reserve position. In spite o f foreign exchange savings from debt
relief, increased inflows from donors, and an exceptionally good season for tobacco in
2008 (Malawi’s main foreign exchange earner), international reserves remain
precariously low, at 1.5 months o f expected imports at the end o f September 2009. The
situation was exacerbated by increased global fertilizer and o i l prices in 2008, which
significantly worsened Malawi’s trade balance. As a result of shortages in the foreign
exchange market, recent reports suggest long delays faced b y the private sector in settling
import invoices, and spreads o f over 20 percent between the official and parallel market
exchange rates.
14.
A political stalemate between the President and the former ruling party
hampered the Government’s ability to legislate until the recent election. President
Mutharika was elected as the ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate, but
subsequently split from the UDF to form a new party, the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP). The Government did not command a majority in Parliament and, while i t was
able to pass some legislation with the support o f various opposition MPs, implementing
the legislative agenda became increasingly a r d u ~ u s .President
~
Mutharika was re-elected
in May 2009 and the DPP won a majority o f seats, which w i l l hopefully allow the
smoother operation o f Parliament.

15.
After good initial progress, the anti-corruption agenda risks stalling. Progress
against corruption faltered while the post o f director of the Anti-Corruption Bureau
remained vacant; a new director was finally appointed in September 2007 after a delay o f
almost a year. During this period, the Bureau was unable to start new cases, prosecute, or
make critical strategic directions, as these legally require the director’s approval.6 This
worsened an existing backlog of cases created b y high turnover of staff.
(b) Progress towards CAS outcomes

16.
Progress towards achieving the goals of the FY07-FYI0 CAS has been mixed.
Good progress has been made towards two of the four CAS Outcomes: outcome (iii)
on
HIV/AIDS and outcome (iv) on Public Expenditure Management. However, there has
been mixed progress on outcome (i)
in agricultural productivity and market development
and similarly on outcome (ii)with some encouraging developments on transport
The impact of this parliamentary impasse was to delay the approval of US$80m of IDA projects. The
Mozambique Interconnector (US$48m) and Agricultural Development Program Support Project (US$32m)
are still waiting for legislative approval.
Between 2006 and 2008, out of the 1900 corruption complaints received, 700 were authorized for
investigations, around 600 investigations were completed and 172 referred for prosecutions. 47
prosecutions were concluded, with 22 convictions secured, 15 acquittals and 6 withdrawals. Two o f the
prosecutions involved a sitting and a former cabinet minister.

infrastructure but little improvement in the investment climate. A full assessment of the
mid-term CAS results i s presented in the annexes but a summary i s given in Table 2.
Progress to date i s summarized in the Results Matrix in Annex 2, with further detailed
analysis in Annex 3.
17.
The World Bank’s program in Malawi has been designed on the basis of
selectivity and donor harmonizationprinciples. In line with the Paris agenda, the World
Bank i s working in close coordination with the Government o f Malawi and other donors.
The Agricultural Development Program (ADP) has been finalized and SWAps are under
preparation in education, infrastructure, water and sanitation, and public sector
management. The Bank i s co-financing five o f eleven projects:

i)

Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development Project,
with the International Fund for Agricultural Development

ii)

Business Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project,
with the European Union

iii)

Agricultural Development Program Support Project (ADP-SP), with
the Norwegian Government

iv)

Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project, under a pooled financing arrangement

v)

National Water Development Project I
I(Africa Catalytic Growth Fund
element), with the UK Department for International Development
(DFID) and the Spanish Government

A Heads of Cooperation Group has been established to facilitate high-level discussion
between donor partners on harmonization and cooperation issues, in line with Paris
agenda principles. Following a key recommendation o f the 2006 Independent Evaluation
Group Country Assistance Evaluation, the Bank i s focusing resources on areas in which i t
has a comparative advantage and withdrawing from sectors where other donors are taking
a lead. As a result, the Bank withdrew from the health sector after the closure of the
Health Sector Support Project in September 2008. However, the Bank remains engaged
in HIV/AIDS and a successor to the Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project i s under preparation.
18.
The Government has taken significant steps to strengthen donor coordination.
Through the Department of Debt and Aid in the Ministry of Finance, the Government i s
now taking a lead role in the coordination of donor assistance. I t s Development
Assistance Strategy was published in November 2007 and an Aid Calendar, outlining the
expected timeline for disbursement of donor funding, i s now produced annually. A
system o f sector working groups has been institutionalized and central ministries have
been strengthened. Further, nearly all development assistance i s now included in the
budget.

c. FY09/FY10 AND BEYOND
(a) Macroeconomic Outlook

19.
The global downturn caused by the dramatic escalation of the financial crisis in
September 2008 has resulted in a significant adjustment in the global economy. The
IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) o f October 2009 projects that global GDP w i l l
contract by 1.1 percent during 2009, with advanced economies contracting by 3.4 percent
while Sub-Saharan Africa i s expected to grow by a modest 1.3 percent. Although modest
global growth i s projected to resume in 2010, the downturn has already resulted in a
sharp decline in world trade, a contraction o f commercial lending, widespread
realignment of exchange rates and the systemic reduction of OECD interest rates.
20.
Yet the global downturn has had a limited impact on Malawi so far, and growth
is expected to stay strong. Firstly, this i s because Malawi’s financial institutions have
been largely insulated from contagion, due to their low exposure to international credit
instruments. However, five of Malawi’s nine banks are foreign owned (constituting 32
percent of the market) and hence vulnerable to shocks experienced by parent banks.
Secondly, the global prices of Malawi’s main exports of tobacco, tea and sugar have not
been subject to large adverse shocks. Finally, significant additional output i s due to be
generated from uranium exports expected to come on stream during 2009. As a
consequence, the IMF’s 2009 growth forecast for Malawi i s 5.9 percent (official forecasts
project a growth rate of 7.6 percent in 2009)’ which i s comparably higher than the global
and regional outlook.
The outlook for domestic inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate is
21.
uncertain, given recent external economic developments and future outlook. In the
near term, inflation i s projected to continue falling, following recent decreases in fuel
prices, the stabilization of food prices, and a better-than-average agricultural season in
2009. However, in the medium term, the outlook i s uncertain, as it i s dependent on
developments in the world economy. For example, while fuel prices have come down
significantly in recent months, the expected resumption o f global growth in late 2009 i s
likely to restore upward pressure on prices. Interest rates in Malawi are primarily
determined b y government domestic borrowing requirements and the overall institutional
efficiency o f the sector. While public-sector domestic borrowing has stabilized,
government finances are extremely dependent on aid flows, which remain uncertain in
the current global environment. The medium-term path of the exchange rate i s similarly
uncertain. In addition to the variability o f global economic developments, the exchange
rate regime itself may also change. The Government i s currently working with the IMF
on the design of a regime that ensures exchange rate stability, export competitiveness,
and reasonable levels of international reserves.

(b) CAS Strategy Implications (FY09-FY10)
22.
The objectives of the FY07-10 CAS remain relevant and aligned to the goals of
the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. The priority areas outlined in the CAS
(agriculture, infrastructure, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, public sector management) remain the
appropriate focus of Bank resources. However, project scheduling and value have been
adjusted in some cases to reflect changes in the implementation environment. For
example, political and administrative constraints have resulted in delayed implementation
of certain projects, and the availability o f additional regional financing has resulted in the
inclusion of projects consistent with regional policy (e.g. Regional Communications
Infrastructure Project).
23.
Ongoing analysis and the recent work of the Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM) confirm the underlying strategic approach. The C E M confirms that
agricultural-led growth, particularly through exports, i s the most viable medium-term
growth strategy. It also emphasizes the need to refocus government policy away from
ad-hoc intervention towards productivity enhancements and the need to increase public
infrastructure investments in power and roads to promote agricultural growth. The CEM
additionally recommends that the exchange rate regime be managed to optimize exports,
and that Malawi should continue to press for the dismantling o f regional trade and transit
barriers. The implication o f the C E M analysis i s therefore that, while the CAS objectives
w i l l be difficult to achieve, they remain the most appropriate goals for Malawi.
24.
The strategy of growth promotion, social protection and improving governance
also remains appropriate in the face of the global downturn. Malawi’s isolation from
international commercial finance and the relatively strong performance o f tobacco
relative to other commodity prices have limited the impact of the global downturn to
slower export growth and a possible squeeze on export finance. However, a prolonged
global recession, coupled with falling tobacco prices and rising prices o f imported inputs,
would create an income shock with potentially serious welfare consequences. As a
result, i t i s important that the CAS program i s sufficiently flexible to enable a rapid
scaling up o f the social protection element. The program w i l l review funding to the
Malawi Social Action Fund and ensure that i t i s able to channel increased project finance
in the event of shocks to smallholder income (as occurred during the drought o f 2005).
As a medium term measure, the Bank has provided financing to the Agriculture sector to
increase agriculture productivity through the Agricultural Development Program Support Project (ADP-SP), and i s preparing a Food SecurityRural Development
Program. The recruitment o f an international Human Development staff member in the
Malawi office w i l l also enhance the Bank’s engagement in the formulation of social
protection policy.

25.
The main obstacles to implementation of the CAS during FY07-08 have been
(a) delays in project approvals and (b) ad-hoc government intervention in agricultural
markets. Project scheduling has primarily been affected b y the impasse in Parliament,
which stalled the approval of the ADP-SP, the Mozambique Interconnector, FY09 energy
sector project, and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) bill. There has also been slow
progress elsewhere in the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes, the establishment of a
9

warehouse receipt company, and the general pace of reform. Further, the ad-hoc setting
of prices, export bans, and domestic trade restrictions have undermined the investment
climate and contributed to a relative decline against peer countries. In addition, there
were significant fiduciary issues under the Health Sector Support Project that affected the
processing o f the pipeline projects.
26.
While the strategy remains relevant, the detailed implementation plans for the
CAS could be modified. It i s clear that agricultural policy i s tightly linked to the political
economy of Malawi. Therefore improvements in agricultural markets and the investment
environment - though crucial - are likely to be gradual. Over the remaining period of the
CAS, the Bank should be prepared to:
a. Maintain solid, real-time analysis of agricultural policy, so that i t can inform
government policy making and donors
b. Broaden performance indicators to include the private sector environment and
agricultural productivity (as already commenced in the Common Approach to
Budget Support (CABS) framework)
c. Bring forwardaugment projects where opportunities for progress exist and be
prepared to delay projects where the policy framework requires attention

(b) Opportunitiesfor enhanced I D A support
27.
Following the successful IDA 15 replenishment, the IDA resources available to
Malawi are likely to increase significantly. The initial Performance Based Allocation
for Malawi for IDA 15 for the FYO9-12 period i s SDR288m7. This represents a
significant increase on the IDA levels for FY09 and FYlO expected at the time‘of writing
the CAS. Conditioning on strong performance, this increase w i l l be absorbed through (a)
enlarging planned projects; and (b) enhancing Malawi’s participation in regional projects,
as foreseen in the CAS. Any increase in budget support should reflect improved policy
performance in agriculture, and improvements in the investment environment.

~~~~

~

~~

This allocation i s indicative only and can change. Only the FY09 and F Y l O allocations are firm. The
actual allocation for FY11 w i l l depend on: (i)
total IDA resources available; (ii)
the country’s performance
rating; (iii)
the performance and assistance terms o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA’S
assistance to Malawi (grants or credits); and (v) the number o f IDA-eligible countries. IDA allocations are
made in SDRs based on performance, and US$equivalent i s dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.
Finally the terms o f assistance (i.e. grants, credits or mix of the two) will depend on Malawi’s debt
sustainability position.

D. RISKS
28.
The risks identified in the CAS remain valid. In particular, recent events have
underscored the vulnerability of progress on the economic reform program and fiscal
discipline to political developments and the electoral cycle. Significant delays have been
experienced in implementation o f World Bank and other donor projects, such as the
Malawi-Mozambique Interconnector and the Agricultural Development Program Support
Project. Progress on the agriculture/food security agenda has proven to be particularly
vulnerable to considerations of political economy. Unless better engagement with the
Government on these issues can now be achieved following the M a y 2009 elections, CAS
Outcome 1 w i l l be in jeopardy.

The global downturn will reduce growth in 2009, and poses a moderate risk of
29.
income shocks over the medium term. Malawi’s recent economic success has been
based on a supply response to improved export prices,* coupled with a significantly
improved macroeconomic environment, which has stabilised prices and enabled
investment to respond to incentives. This improvement in economic performance has
begun to lift significant numbers o f people out o f poverty, but w i l l require sustained
investment and favourable export prices to continue. The sharp contraction of advanced
economies in 2009 presents a risk to economic growth in Malawi through:
Possible reduction in export demand. Reduced demand for tobacco, sugar or tea
could adversely affect growth through lower export revenues, a worsening trade
balance, and the possibly inflationary effects of an exchange rate correction. The
effect o f reduced tobacco demand might be delayed into 2010 if tobacco
companies absorb surplus production by building up of stocks in 2009.
Possible reduction in aid, remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI).
Further pressure on foreign exchange earnings could be exerted through several
channels. Firstly, public-sector tightening or exchange rate movements in donor
countries could reduce the real domestic value of aid (for example, the value o f
DFID’s commitments fell b y 25 percent in kwacha terms during 2008). Secondly,
the rise in OECD unemployment could reduce remittances, which are currently
estimated at 4 percent of GDP. Thirdly, it i s likely that the downturn and credit
squeeze w i l l reduce new FDI in Malawi in 2009/10.

30.
HZWAZDS remains a major threat. In spite of recent progress, the HIVIAIDS
pandemic has had a significant impact on the human capital essential for Malawi’s
growth. While recent data on the adult HIV prevalence rate i s encouraging, more work i s
required to understand the drivers o f the pandemic, and increasing the effectiveness of the
prevention effort i s essential. The fiscal sustainability of the Anti-Retroviral Therapy
(ART) program i s also not assured.

Particularly tobacco.

ANNEX 3: ANALYSISOF CAS OUTCOMES

OUTCOME I: Improve smallholder agricultural productivity and integration into
agro-processing

1.
Agriculture and food security is at the core of the CAS agenda. With agriculture
accounting for over 35 percent of GDP and over 80 percent o f export earnings and
employment, increasing smallholder productivity i s key to ensuring household food
security, boosting rates o f economic growth and reducing poverty. In 2007, concerns
about the slow rate o f agricultural growth and the diversity o f small, short-term
agricultural projects in the country led the Government to define a new Agricultural
Development Program (ADP). T h i s aims to coordinate sectoral investments into a more
consistent and results-oriented program. lo The World Bank supported the initial
formulation of the ADP, and in 2008, the Board approved the US$32 million Agricultural
Development Program Support Project (ADP-SP)." The Results Framework for the
ADP now provides a foundation for targeting future donor support for agriculture in the
country. As a comprehensive and strategic approach to the agricultural sector, the ADP
represents a significant step forward.
Improve irrigation and farming practices: Much remains to be done to put
2.
agriculture in Malawi on a commercial footing. The Bank i s in the initial stages of
work with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security to develop a project to promote
more commercialized farming practices. The Ministry has so far concentrated on
achieving national food security, and the commitment of resources under the ADP-SP,
the Irrigation and Rural Livelihoods Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP) and the
Community-Based Rural Land Development Project (CBRLDP) supports this focus.
However, the Ministry now recognizes the importance o f facilitating the growth o f
commercial production and marketing a more diverse range of crops. The country
remains dependent on tobacco for 60 percent of i t s foreign exchange earnings. The next
most important crops are sugar and tea, where profits largely accrue to the estate sector.
The challenge remains to broaden income gains through improvements in the
productivity o f enterprises such as cotton, coffee, paprika, nuts, vegetables, dairy, poultry
and fish farming.

3.
I t is not yet clear what role expanded irrigation will play in this context.
Malawi's efforts to expand the area under irrigation remain constrained by the country's
limited engineering capacity, the high cost o f maintaining and rehabilitating existing
schemes, and difficulties with water management structures. The Bank i s working with
the Government to identify solutions to these constraints in the year ahead.

lo
The ADP outlines national efforts to achieve 6 percent growth rates, through allocation o f at least 15
percent of the national budget to the agricultural sector, as mandated by the African Union under the
Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program.
Effectiveness o f the ADP-SP has been substantially delayed by the political impasse in parliament.

4.
Improve market incentives for surplus production. The Bank has pursued a twotrack strategy on grain market reforms: restructuring o f the state marketing board,
ADMARC; and the implementation of a series of risk management initiatives. In line
with the restructuring program approved by the Cabinet in 2006, A D M A R C has
streamlined i t s activities by closing ancillary departments (clinics, tailoring workshops,
etc.) and contracting out these services to the private sector. A D M A R C has sold i t s
shares in various subsidiary companies, closed down the A D M A R C Investment Holding
Company ( A M C ) and laid off more than 300 staff. Several A D M A R C depots are in the
process o f being passed to a new warehouse leasing company, the Malawi Agricultural
Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO).

5.
Recent government intervention in the maize market indicates that reforms
aflecting the trade of key commodities remain controversial. Maize trade has been
largely liberalized over the past twenty years. By 2007, the private sector accounted for
the bulk of trade flows, although the Government remained the dominant stockholder.
However, many in Government remain concerned about the risks o f complete
dependence on the private sector to maintain adequate levels of grain stocks. Uncertainty
about the reasons for rising maize prices in the face o f estimated crop surpluses in 2007
and 2008 led to the re-establishment of stricter price and trade controls in August 2008;
private traders were asked to sell their inventories to ADMARC. These restrictions were
lifted in M a y 2009 but private traders and stockholders have again seen signals that i t i s
risky to engage in this trade and particularly risky to hold significant stocks.
6.
Strengthen integration and links to input/output markets. The Government’s
Agricultural Input Subsidy Program (AISP) has been in operation since the 2005/06
agricultural season, and aims to help poor households access fertilizer and other modem
inputs to increase farm productivity. However, the sustainability o f this program has
been drawn into question by the huge increase in costs during the 2008/09 season. The
AISP now accounts for more than 13 percent o f the national budget, and over 70% o f the
budget o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and Food Security. The AISP has now been
expanded to cover tobacco, cotton, coffee, and tea, in addition to maize. More than onehalf o f all maize seed sold in the country i s now distributed through the AISP with a
100% subsidy. The majority of fertilizer sold in Malawi i s now distributed through the
AISP with more than a 90% subsidy. While the private sector imported 80% o f the
fertilizer used in the program, most retail sales (in exchange for subsidy coupons) take
place through national parastatals. In 2008, fertilizer companies were no longer allowed
to accept subsidy coupons. Input subsidies need to be better targeted in relation to well
defined and measurable performance indicators and the subsidy program should be
contributing to the expansion of commercial markets for agricultural inputs. The Inputs
for Assets effort under the IRLADP offers a strategy for better targeting these subsidies
toward poorer households.
7.
Establish storage and mitigation measures for food security risks over time.
The establishment o f the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company
(MAWTCO) aims to deepen markets in urban and peri-urban areas, and encourage

27

ADMARC to concentrate on rural areas. While progress has been slow, the
establishment of M A W T C O i s progressing: MAWTCO’s Memorandum and Articles of
Association have been prepared and the incorporation of M A W T C O i s expected soon.
The core o f the company’s mandate i s to lease excess warehouse assets currently held by
A D M A R C on the commercial market. This w i l l offset the need for the private sector to
replicate these assets and encourage the development of warehousing services. Bank
support for developing the regulatory guidelines for a warehouse receipt system
complements these efforts.
8.
The Agricultural Development Program highlights better risk management as a
key Government objective. The Bank has been doing pioneering work with the
Government on macro weather insurance and in September 2008, the Board approved the
Weather Index Derivative Transaction Agreement, which w i l l allow the country to offset
the risks of severe drought on the national maize crop. The World Bank provided
technical support for a successful call option underlying the purchase o f maize imports
following drought in 2005. T h i s i s estimated to have saved the country approximately
US$80 per ton on import costs. Technical discussions continue on related price hedgin
options. The Government tendered for repurchase (REPO) contracts in 2007 and 2008. 15
However, no contracts were ultimately signed. Continuing technical assistance for a
micro-weather insurance program has led to the expansion o f this on a pilot scale in the
tobacco sector, and new interest in further expansion in cotton and tea. I t i s hoped that
greater experience and confidence in Government in the application o f these various risk
management tools w i l l reduce the likelihood of short-term, unpredictable trade controls.
Support for on-going strengthening o f the Government’s agricultural risk management
capabilities i s being provided b y the Bank’s Commodity Risk Management Group under
the IDA-financed ADP-SP.

OUTCOME 11: Put in place a foundation for longer term economic growth
through improved infrastructure and investment climate
Improve energy generation and transport

9.
While there has been little visible progress in the energy sector, a number of
factors give cause for cautious optimism about longer-term prospects. Quality of
electricity supply was the fourth most serious constraint for businesses, according to the
2006 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). The Mozambique-Malawi Transmission
Interconnector Project to connect Malawi to the Southern African Power Pool was
approved b y the World Bank Board in July 2007. However, political stalemate in
Parliament prior to the M a y 2009 elections has meant that the credit i s s t i l l awaiting
Parliamentary approval and subsequent signature. T h i s has also delayed the preparation
l2Under a REPO agreement, the Government would have first rights to purchase stocks held in the country
by the private sector at an agreed price. Should i t be established that the country w i l l have enough maize
during the lean season, the private sector would be allowed to export the grain. Under a call option, the
Government i s able to lock in an import price for grain held outside the country, which i t can call upon in
the event o f a shortage.

28

o f the proposed FY09 energy sector project. However, Mozambique remains interested
in an extension of the interconnector into northern Mozambique, and a full feasibility
study w i l l be launched shortly. In Malawi, the power capacity balance w i l l soon ease
somewhat, following the return to service of Units Iand I1 of the Tedzani hydropower
scheme. Sector management and governance have improved with the establishment in
2008 of a new sector regulator, the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA), as
well as the appointment o f a new CEO at the electricity company ESCOM. Other
development partners are increasingly interested in the energy sector: the Millennium
Challenge Corporation i s interested in making significant investments, and Norway i s
setting up a Trust Fund for investment in energy projects with regional significance,
including support for the Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector and i t s extension into
northern Mozambique.

10.
Developments in transport have also been mixed. The Government has
completed a Roads Master plan, but has yet to develop a prioritized sector plan in
transport. The Bank’s Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (ROMARP), which
closed in June 2006, established the Roads Database and the Road Fund, and supported
significant institutional reform of financing and planning in the roads sector. The
European Commission, African Development Bank and Millennium Challenge
Corporation are all looking to make significant investments in the transport sector. The
Government has asked the Bank to investigate linking Malawi to the rehabilitated Sena
rail line through Mozambique to the port of Beira, as well as improving existing l i n k s to
Nacala port in northern Mozambique.
11.
While the CAS did not identify specific milestones regarding water
infrastructure, coordination and financing of the sector has improved markedly.
Implementation o f the US$50 million Second National Water Development Project
(NWDPII) has generally progressed well, but some key medium- to long-term reforms
envisaged b y the Government have been delayed. The European UnionEuropean
Investment Bank (EU/EIB) loan bill (which provides complimentary funds to the
NWDPII) has been approved by Parliament after a delay, and w i l l now support the
development o f a proper institutional framework for sustainable urban water service
delivery. The water situation i s particularly pressing in the commercial center of
Blantyre, where further investments are urgently required to help mitigate disruptions in
water supply. Development o f the water sector SWAP i s progressing well; the
preparation process with key donors and sector stakeholders was launched in December
2008. In addition, the Bank team prepared Malawi’s successful application for funds
from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF). The US$25 million i s being used to
complement investments in town, market center, and rural water sub-sectors, and
implementation i s progressing well.

Address policy issues in the investment climate
12.
Despite some improvements, progress on the investment climate has been weak.
One of the key achievements of Bank support has been the establishment of a
Commercial Court in 2007. As o f March 2008, i t took an average o f 125 days to settle

29

commercial disputes, significantly below the target o f 290 days for 2008. However,
Malawi’s position in the Doing Business rankings deteriorated in 2007, 2008 and 2009,
reflecting the slow pace of reform relative to other ~ 0 u n t r i e s . l ~At the current pace of
reform, the CAS Outcome Indicators and Milestones related to the business climate w i l l
not be achieved (see Results Matrix). In addition, ad hoc government interventions in the
maize and fertilizer markets continue to undermine business confidence and discourage
private sector activity.

13.

A Public Private Partnership (PPP) Bill was published by the Government of
Malawi in August 2008. This was an agreed dated covenant o f the Business
Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP). However, the bill
has yet to be submitted to Parliament for approval. A draft PPP policy framework i s
scheduled to be submitted to Cabinet for approval and a PPP unit i s now located in the
Privatization Commission.

14.
At the Government’s request, the Bank completed a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) and a Corporate Governance Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC). Both the FSAP and the Corporate Governance ROSC
have been concluded and the Government has been receptive to their key messages.
Results of the 2006 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) have been fed into the drafting
process of the new Private Sector Development (PSD) Policy and Strategy and were also
used in the design o f BESTAP.
15.
The I F C is also supporting the Government’s efforts to improve the business
climate. LFC technical assistance contributed to the establishment o f the new Commercial
Court and i s supporting work towards a new licensing regime. The IFC’s Small and
Medium Enterprises (SME) Enterprise Development Initiative worked with the Malawi
Export Promotion Council (MEPC) on a countrywide sector mapping exercise to identify
SME export opportunities, and on the production o f an SME exporter handbook,
completed in November 2008. l4
Improve access to finance

16.
SMEs have started accessing matching grants which are facilitating business
growth and improving access to financing. The Business Growth Scheme (BUGS),
under BESTAP includes a US$1.8 million Business Development Services fund. From
this fund BUGS reimburses 50 percent of costs incurred by SMEs in accessing finance
(through the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, market research etc.), up to
a maximum o f US$50,000. While the number o f grants made (89) i s below the expected

l3
Malawi slipped from 106 in the Ease of Doing Business ranking in 2006, to 110 in 2007, 131 in 2008 and
again to 134 in 2009.
l4The handbook i s a comprehensive guide to the export process in Malawi, containing relevant contacts,
transportation details, business development services, export documentation templates, trade agreements
and other information. I t will be handed over to the MEPC to be updated on an annual basis and distributed
to exporters for a nominal fee.

30

level, the engagement of additional staff and improved promotion i s expected to increase
SME uptake.
17.
The IFC is seeking to increase its engagement in Malawi, focusing on
investments and advisory activities that help diversify the economy, develop the Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector and improve access to finance. The IFC i s
in discussions to commit US$1.5 million to Hotel Victoria in Blantyre. In June 2008, the
IFC committed US$5 million to Bakhresa Malawi, a flour milling company, and US$3
million was committed to NBS Bank in FY08 under the MSME program. The IFC’s
Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) in Malawi seeks to a) expand available financing
and reduce the need for cash collateralized transactions; b) provide longer maturities than
currently available; and c) deliver technical assistance and training to improve operating
standards. In May 2008, a US$lOmillion GTFP line was signed with First Merchant
Bank.
18.
The I F C is exploring the inclusion of three more banks in the Global Trade
Finance Program. A US$7 million trade line to NBS Bank was approved by December
2008, while initial discussions towards similar lines to National Bank o f Malawi and
Ecobank Malawi are underway. The IFC i s also in discussions with mobile telecom
company Zain and local banks for a risk-sharing facility to increase access to finance for
Zain’s distributors. This follows an IFC commitment in FY07 o f US$15 million to Zain
Malawi, as part of a multi-country facility.

19.
Given the slow pace of reform by Malawi and the country’s deteriorating global
ranking in the Doing Business Survey, there is a need for greater government
commitment to the investment climate reform agenda. In the short term, i t w i l l be
important to ensure that the PPP Bill i s submitted and passed b y Parliament, in addition
to numerous other outstanding pieces of legislation.
OUTCOME 111: Decrease vulnerability at the household level from HIVIAIDSand
malnutrition
Improved HIV/AIDs awareness, access to drugs and treatment

20.
Good progress has been made increasing awareness of HIVIAIDS and
improving access to.treatment. The number o f people living with HIVIAIDS receiving
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has improved from around 57,000 in 2006 to over 140,000
people b y December 2008. T h i s treatment coverage rate i s one of the highest in highprevalence IDA countries in Southern Africa. Similar progress was achieved in
increasing the number o f HIV testing and counseling sites, and the number of people
being tested. In 2001, there were only 14 sites offering testing and counseling services.
According to the Ministry of Health, there are currently 410 sites in Malawi. Over 20
percent o f orphans and other vulnerable children are receiving free external support
(medical, psychosocial or material) and, given underreporting, the actual figure i s likely
to be considerably higher.

31

21.
A follow-on operation for the HIV/AIDS Pooled Financing operation is
planned. As outlined in the CAS, the Bank has discontinued i t s financing in the health
sector and the Bank’s contribution to the Malawi Health Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp)
closed, as planned, in September 2008. However, a US$30 million operation i s being
designed as Additional Financing to the original HIV/ADDS project. This operation w i l l
support and strengthen the national response to HIV/AlDS in Malawi, in line with the
Government’s National Action Framework, and finance a further three years of a national
program. It w i l l contribute financially towards the implementation o f the joint program
of work within the HIV/AIDS SWAp, which i s co-financed b y multiple donors and the
Government of Malawi. Priority w i l l be given to ensuring that the momentum developed
in HIV testing and treatment continues, and that more effort i s placed on supporting
evidence-based prevention strategies.
Nutrition
Malawi is still lacking a coherent and integrated approach to nutrition. A
22.
nationwide awareness and information campaign has promoted good feeding practices for
under-5 and school-age children. Sector work i s underway to provide a basis for a
nutrition program; the Bank has initiated work on a multi-partner study examining
determinants of infant and child feeding practices in Malawi and consultations have
begun with the Government. Other development partners, for example Ireland, have
indicated willingness to provide financial support to a nutrition program, and assuming
program development goes ahead, IDA w i l l also consider financing this under the next
CAS.

Social Protection Program
23.
The World Bank is supporting the development and implementation of a
comprehensive social protection strategy. The Bank i s funding three social protection
interventions to help offset the worst instances of poverty. The Bank approved the new
Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) 3 APL 11, which w i l l provide US$35 million to
support a public works cash transfer program through local government, to assist up to
600,000 households to purchase agricultural inputs, grains, and other basic necessities in
the event o f food security-related shocks. With funding from the Building Resilient
Communities Trust Fund, the Bank supported the development o f a Social Support Policy
to promote an integrated approach to social protection investments. The policy has been
discussed by Cabinet, and the National Social Protection Committee i s now reviewing i t
to incorporate Cabinet comments and consulting with relevant ministries. The revised
document w i l l be returned to Cabinet for approval. Looking forward, cabinet approval o f
a social protection program, which identifies instruments for the implementation of the
Social Support Policy, w i l l be a priority in 2009. Finally, the Multi-Donor Trust Fund of
the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery: Track 2 for Malawi i s providing
technical assistance to the Government of Malawi to mainstream disaster risk reduction
in strategic planning and sectoral development policies.

32

OUTCOME IV: Sustain improvements in expenditure management, transparency

and accountability

Institutional system for accountability and transparency

24.
Malawi’s macroeconomicprogram has progressed well over the past three years
but is now at risk of going off-track. Malawi achieved three consecutive years o f good
macroeconomic management through the implementation o f an IMF-sponsored Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The sixth and final review o f the PRGF was
approved by the Board o f the IMF on July 14, 2008. In December 2008, the IMF Board
approved a one year program, the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF), to support
adjustment to the terms of trade shocks caused by rapid increases in fuel and fertilizer
prices in 2008. The Fund plans to discuss a new program with the authorities following
the recent elections. However, at the time of writing, the ESF program was at risk of
going off-track, due to significant additional purchases o f fertilizer for the subsidy
program without secured financing and uncertainty surrounding the World Bank’s PRSC2 funding, after appraisal could not be successfully c0nc1uded.l~ As a result, the
domestic borrowing target may be missed.
25.
With increased staffing levels, and the appointment of an Auditor General, the
National Audit Office has been working on clearing the backlog in the submission of
audit reports. The capacity of the National Audit Office (NAO) has been strengthened
by the recruitment in 2007 o f 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. As a result, more
Government entities are now being audited. There has also been an improvement in the
timeliness with which external audits are being conducted and submitted to Parliament.
T h i s i s partly because, since the r o l l out of the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS) in 2005, there has been a significant improvement in the
preparation of accounts at the end o f the financial year, and partly because o f the
appointment o f a new Auditor General in July 2008. The post o f Auditor General, who
must legally sign off on Audit Reports before they are submitted to the legislature,
remained vacant for a long period during political wrangling over the appointment. The
2004/05 and 2005/06 Audit Reports have now been submitted to Parliament, and the
2006/07 Report i s expected soon. As the financial statements for the 2007/08 fiscal year
were submitted promptly towards the end o f November (only one month over the
statutory requirement), the auditing process w i l l soon be up-to-date.
26.
While considerable progress has been made on capacity development in internal
audit, significant challenges remain. Commitment and support from the Government
for the internal audit function have increased over the past two years. All ministries now
have internal audit units (IAUs) and internal audit committees (IACs), but so far only 12
~

l5Appraisal of the second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-2) could not be concluded because:
(i) two key prior actions had not been met; (ii) the Government had not finalized a new letter of
development policy; and (iii) there was need for further clarification from the Government on the
expansion of the fertilizer subsidy program, given the risk i t poses to the macroeconomic program, which i s
a fundamental requirement of the PRSC.

33

of the largest ministries (out of the total 20) have functional IACs which actively meet.
This ensures coverage o f about 60% of public expenditures. There i s a critical need to
expand coverage in all ministries and in the major public enterprises. While the capacity
and reputation o f the Central Internal Audit Unit has increased substantially, many
institutional barriers continue to undermine internal controls. Major challenges include:
(i)
retention of trained staff; (ii)
support of the internal audit functions by management in
the various ministries, especially the functioning of IACs; (iii)
action on audit findings i s
s t i l l ad hoc and has a weak legislative basis; and (iv) delays in the passage o f the
Amendment Bill through Parliament to strengthen the internal audit function within the
Public Financial Management Act.

The Government has taken measures to strengthen control of the payroll. In
27.
September 2006, the Government introduced a new system for managing personnel and
payroll records, the Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS). The
system ensures that payroll data i s automatically updated following a change to personnel
data and was expected to reduce the problems of ghost workers, inaccurate wage
projections, and unauthorized allowances, recruitments, promotions, and wage increases.
A database of all Government employees was compiled in 2006 and reconciled with
payroll records. Consultants were engaged to conduct the review o f the integrity o f
HRMIS and an inception report was produced and accepted b y the Office o f the President
and Cabinet. Further, two personnel audits covering the whole public service physically
verified the existence o f each staff member and updated the personnel database.
Substantial progress has been made in procurement capacity building. There
28.
has been significant investment in training of procurement staff of all levels (see Results
Matrix). Six officers with postgraduate qualifications were seconded to the Malawi
Polytechnic to support the design and teaching of a Bachelor’s degree in Logistics and
Supply Chain Management, offered from M a y 2008, to provide a domestic and regional
hub for public procurement training.
29.
Looking forward, the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series is
continuing to focus on improving the budget process, payroll management, debt
management, and external auditing. The PRSC i s supporting measures to improve the
linkage between the MGDS (Malawi’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)) and
the national budget, in order to ensure that all national budgets are consistent with the
medium-term priority development objectives and strategies outlined in the MGDS. The
PRSC w i l l also continue to support initiatives to improve payroll management, with a
focus on recommendations from the HRMIS review and the personnel audit. On debt
management, the PRSC w i l l be supporting measures to improve coordination between the
Ministry o f Finance and the Reserve Bank of Malawi. Finally, with regard to external
auditing, the focus w i l l be on follow-up of audit reports.
Intergovernmentalfatal and expenditure management
Goodprogress has been made on decentralization. A Local Development Fund
30.
(LDF) has been developed, to be managed b y the Ministry o f Finance, implemented by

34

the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and monitored b y the
National Local Government Finance Committee. The Ministry of Finance agreed in
2008 to lead coordination efforts to align the use o f government funds with donor
resources to finance services at the community and Local Assembly levels, with a view to
achieving greater efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery. In a further step
forward, MASAF I11 has been incorporated into the public financing system. Looking
ahead, finalizing the design of an Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer System that enables
Local Assemblies to plan and implement investments targeted at poverty reduction
should be a priority.

ANNEX 11: MALAWICOUNTRYFINANCING
PARAMETERS

Malawi: Country Parameters on Expenditure Eligibility

The country financing parameters for Malawi set out below have been approved b y the
Regional Vice President for Africa, and have been posted on the Bank’s internal website.
Item
Cost Sharing. Limit on the
proportion of individual project
costs that the Bank may finance

Parameter

100%

Recurrent costfinancing. Any
l i m i t s that would apply to the
overall amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
finance?

N o country
- level limit

Local costfinancing. Are the
requirements for Bank financing
of local expenditures met, namely
that: (i)
financing requirements
for the country’s development
program would exceed the public
sector’s own resources and
expected domestic borrowing;
and (ii)
the financing of foreign
expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing of individual projects?
Taxes and duties. Are there any
taxes and duties that the Bank
would not finance?

Yes

RemarkdExplanation
The Bank may finance up to 100
percent o f the costs of individual
operations after considering the
context of these operations and
portfolio implications within the CAS
envelope. Counterpart funding w i l l
be encouraged.
The Bank may finance recurrent costs
as needed in individual projects, after
overall medium-term
considering: (i)
fiscal sustainability; (ii)
the
sustainability o f project
achievements; (iii)
implied future
budgetary outlays; and (iv) Malawi’s
aggregate fiscal position and
prospects.
The Bank may finance local costs in
the proportions needed in individual
projects.

As of June 2004, no taxes are
identified as unreasonable or
discriminatory.
