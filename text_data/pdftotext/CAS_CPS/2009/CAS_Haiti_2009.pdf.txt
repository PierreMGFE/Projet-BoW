EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
The World Bank and the LFC have jointly prepared this Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Haiti for FY09-12, to align their assistance with the country’s 2007 National
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (the DSNCRP). The CAS also reflects
strategic reassessment by the Government following the food crisis and severe storms o f
2008, and amid a difficult global economic context.
promoting growth and local development; (ii)
investing
2.
The CAS has three pillars: (i)
in human capital; and (iii)
reducing vulnerability to disasters. Cutting across the strategy is a
two-pronged approach, combining longer-term institution building (including economic
governance reform) with support for the Government in the delivery o f quick, visible results.
3.
Within these areas, new interventions will be determined by: (i)
Haitian priorities,
primarily as expressed in the DSNCRP; (ii)areas in which World Bank Group (WBG)
projects already achieve progress; (iii)
WBG areas o f comparative advantage; and (iv) other
donor activities, to fill gaps or leverage investments from other partners or the private sector.

4.
Expected outcomes, which will be generated mainly through projects already
an increase in income-generating opportunities and better access to
underway, include: (i)
increased access to basic education; (iii)
strengthened
infrastructure services and finance; (ii)
institutional capacity for disaster preparation, response and recovery; and (iv) improved
public sector management systems.
5.
The WBG plans to maintain strong and flexible support for Haiti. Ensuring
successful implementation o f the current portfolio will remain a priority. N e w IDA funding
in the CAS period comes through a balanced mix o f investment projects and development
policy operations. The Bank also expects to mobilize considerable trust fund resources. I t
will maintain a strong program o f analytical and advisory activities, and will work to advance
aid coordination and harmonization. I F C will aim to catalyze private sector development
through direct lending and advisory services, and leveraging donor support for private sector
development. Maximizing WBG synergies will broaden WBG coverage and impact.
6.
The Bank aims for greater selectivity o f focus to consolidate progress and adjust to a
declining IDA envelope. From mid-FY10 onwards, new IDA projects are envisioned in just
three areas in which the Bank already has a strong program (CDD, education, and
institutional strengthening). However the current portfolio, including FY09 projects, gives
the Bank a strong presence in other sectors throughout the CAS period.
7.
Total IDA allocations for FY09-FY12, including additional amounts above the basic
envelope, are projected at roughly US$121 million at current exchange rates, an average o f
US$30 million a year. Final IDA allocations for future years will depend o n relative Couhtry
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) performance and other factors.
8.
Among sectors, IFC’s primary focus will be on: (i)facilitating access to finance
(Micro, S M E and trade finance, including rural finance, credit bureau creation); (ii)
infrastructure (access to basic services, mainly electricity including possibly renewable
energy, advisory services to facilitate private sector participation in infrastructure); (iii)

i

’

lending and advising in growth sectors (e.g. investment opportunities presented by the
Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement A c t I1 [HOPE 111,
preferential market access in the garment sector, and tourism and agribusiness); and (iv)
human capital development, emphasizing training and basic business skills. IFC’s program
will also include advisory projects to improve the business environment in support o f
regulatory reform and investment promotion, free trade zones, and Doing Business reform.

9.
The strategy proposed in the CAS will be undertaken in an environment o f high risks.
These risks include: (i)
political and social instability; (ii)
knock-on effects o f international
financial crisis and economic downturn; (iii)
susceptibility to external shocks more generally;
(iv) vulnerability to natural disasters; (v) a highly risky fiduciary environment; (vi) weak
institutional capacity, which can impede successfil project implementation; and (vii)
legislative opposition or inactivity.
10.
At the same time, given the progress made by the country since 2004, promising early
results from the Bank’s portfolio and the commitment o f authorities to advancing with
reform, the potential rewards for implementing this strategy are great. Mitigation measures
reflect lessons from the WBG’s experience in fragile states worldwide, as well as the
institution’s earlier experience in Haiti.
11.
If the policy or security environments deteriorate, governance weakens or broad or
sector-specific program implementation issues materialize, the WBG would conduct a
carefbl review o f ongoing and planned operations and activities and consult with
international partners before deciding how to proceed. I t would inform the Board
accordingly. This corresponds to normal WBG practice in fragile or uncertain situations.
The WBG response would be commensurate with the risks that materialize. The Group
would seek to stay engaged in sectors or areas where implementation is considered
satisfactory.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
A series o f external shocks hit Haiti hard in 2008, illustrating the country’s extreme
vulnerability and undermining the development progress achieved since 2004. High world
prices for food and fuel caused widespread hardship, triggering violent protests and political
discontent, which prompted the Senate to dismiss Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis
and his Cabinet on April 12. Subsequently, in August and September 2008, Tropical Storm
Fay and Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and I k e dealt a series o f further blows. The combined
impact o f these storms constituted the country’s largest natural disaster in more than a
hundred years, with damages and losses estimated at roughly US$900 million, or around 15
$percento f GDP.
2.
Conditions in Haiti remain extremely difficult, and the risk o f social and political
instability i s high. The country requires urgent and plentiful international assistance to
recover, rebuild, and provide jobs and services to those in need. I t also needs strong support
to get the longer term development program back o n track, reduce vulnerability to future
disasters and shocks, and promote private sector activity.

3.
W h i l e the outlook for 2009 and beyond i s finther clouded by the difficult
international economic environment, there are still grounds for optimism regarding Haiti’s
growth and development prospects. Many o f the gains made by the country in 2004-2008
have endured, despite recent events. Democratic politics, though strained, have prevailed,
with a new Prime Minister now in place and President RenC PrCval remaining as president.
Wide-ranging reforms and service enhancements continue, while security has improved.
Furthermore, close proximity to U S markets, preferential access to these under the Haitian
Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act I1(HOPE 11), competitive
labor costs and strong international support present valuable opportunities.
4.
The strategy outlined in this document presents the proposed program o f the World
Bank Group in this context. I t illustrates the efforts made to provide emergency support to
Haiti since early 2008, while also emphasizing vulnerability reduction and longer term
growth potential. While this strategy covers the period starting July 2008, finalization has
been delayed to enable both effective crisis response and adaptation to evolving Haitian
strategic priorities and imperatives.

A.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXT

5.
Haiti’s democracy has consolidated since 2004, when President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide resigned and left the country amid a conflict that killed thousands and destroyed
much public and private property, including infrastructure. After two years under a
transitional government, Haiti held presidential and parliamentary elections in 2006. The
48th legislature was opened in M a y 2006, ending three years o f legislative paralysis - and
strengthening checks and balances in the political system. President Ren6 PrCval who w o n
the 2006 presidential race, running for the Lespwa Party, has remained in office.
6.
However, social and political stability remain fragile, as the violent protest and fall o f
the Government in April 2008 illustrate. W h i l e the food crisis was the trigger, the underlying
factors that contribute to instability include the country’s acute poverty and inequality, as
well as the chronic weakness o f political and government institutions. Due to a political
impasse, it was five months before the National Assembly ratified a new Government-under
Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis-in September 2008. Elections for a third o f the Senate
went ahead on April 19, 2009, after repeated delays due to restructuring o f the electoral
council and the passage o f a new electoral code. In the next three years, multiple elections’
and proposed constitutional reform could contribute to political polarization and increase the
risk o f social and political upheaval, while absorbing government attention and resources and
slowing legislative activity.

7.
The overall security situation has improved markedly but serious problems remain. In
December 2006, the 9,000-strong United Nations Mission for Stabilization in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) and the Haitian National Police (PNH) launched direct operations against
major gang leaders in the violent Port-au-Prince slums o f Cite Solei1 and Martissant. These
succeeded in weakening gang control and largely returned these areas to state control.
Kidnapping rates, while down from 2006, remain high, along with rates o f other violent
crimes. The trans-shipment o f U.S.-bound cocaine and heroin continues, fuelling other
criminal activity and undermining security and stability. The expansion o f the PNH i s
advancing slowly with UN support, but the force i s s t i l l too small to effectively police the
country, with around 8,500 officers (against a minimum target o f 14,000).
B.

GOVERNANCE
AND INSTITUTIONS

8.
Governance and state capacity to effectively formulate and implement sound policies,
and to deliver core public services to the population, are weak. The state’s ability to provide
basic public goods has been undermined by a history o f neglect, political capture, and
corruption. The state is present largely in the major urban centers and has been unable to
provide basic services or infrastructure to large portions o f the population. The non-state
sector has filled gaps in the provision o f health and education services, but these efforts have
been largely uncoordinated and unregulated.
The institutions responsible for providing essential public goods o f security and the
9.
rule o f law (police and judiciary) are largely ineffective and have historically suffered from

’

Further legislative elections are scheduled for November 2009 and in 2010, while presidential elections are
due in 20 11.

political interference and corruption. A governance and corruption survey undertaken by the
Haitian Government in 2006, identified payment o f bribes - to access basic public services or
licenses, influence court decisions, or award public contracts or positions - as a major form o f
corruption in the country. The public sector faces human resource weaknesses, due to local
s k i l l shortages compounded by massive outward migration, l o w state salaries, competition
from international organizations and the private sector. Inadequate financial and material
resources and outdated organizational structures and procedures pose further challenges.
10.
Strengthening the Haitian state is particularly critical in the following areas: (i)
guaranteeing citizen security; (ii)
economic governance (sound macroeconomic management,
public administration, and market formulation and regulation); (iii)
planning and overseeing
basic service provision and infrastructure development, and (iv) promoting transparency and
accountability.

11.
The Government and donors are engaged in serious efforts at institutional
strengthening, including capacity strengthening and the creation o f mechanisms to guide and
monitor performance throughout the public sector. Strengthening democratic governance,
with an emphasis on justice and security, i s a pillar o f the DSNCRP, while the modernization
o f the public sector is a key cross-cutting theme.
12.
Progress in strengthening core government institutions and systems since 2004 has
been significant. Haiti has introduced broad-ranging economic governance reforms,
including the re-establishment and strengthening o f regular budget processes, increasing the
transparency o f budget information, enhancing budgetary oversight, and reinforcing the legal
and institutional framework for public procurement. Building o n the 1987 Constitution,
which has not been fully implemented, a series o f new framework laws have modernized
basic systems and procedures. Economic stabilization and improved security allowed
improvements in revenue mobilization and budget execution.

13.
Anti-comption efforts have intensified, with public awareness campaigns, the
creation o f an anti-corruption office, and the passage o f a law on asset declaration for senior
officials. Spending through discretionary ministerial accounts has been slashed to below 10
percent o f current expenditures, from 62 percent in early 2004. Efforts are being made to
disseminate more information on Government activities and engage civil society in
monitoring the implementation o f economic governance reforms. However, public financial
management processes and controls, and resource management are still weak, and the overall
fiduciary environment i s risky.
14.
However, experience shows that sustainable institutional strengthening takes time. A
key immediate challenge for the Government is to improve implementation o f the new legal
framework, by building the capacity o f central government agencies for revenue,
expenditure, procurement and human resource management, and then gradually extending
coverage to offices handling financial management and planning functions in sectoral
ministries. Ensuring these core institutions function appropriately and coordinate with each
other, i s key for improving service delivery as well as for promoting a steady flow o f
resources and their efficient use. Ultimately, this will be key to delivering tangible
improvements in the quality o f services for the population, and to provide an environment for
job creation.

POVERTY PROFILE,

GENDER
AND PROGRESS TOWARDS
MDGS

15.
Haiti is by far the poorest country in Latin American and the Caribbean and among
the poorest in the world, with 54 percent o f the population living o n below U S $ l a day and
78 percent on less than US$2 a day in 20012. The 2008.United Nations Human Development
Index ranked Haiti 148 out of 179 countries. Income inequality i s high, with a Gini
Coefficient o f 0.59, among the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean.
16.
The World Bank’s 2006 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)3 showed that
Haiti’s poverty i s manifested in poor access to infrastructure, minimal ownership o f assets,
l o w education and literacy levels, and prevalent child malnutrition.
Haiti is also
characterized by marked inequalities in access to productive assets and public services. Little
variation is seen in the quality o f living conditions across the poorest 80 percent o f the
population, while the richest quintile i s markedly better along all dimensions. While data i s
inadequate i t appears that for the country as a whole poverty and inequality rates have not
changed substantially since 1986. Many Haitians seem to have avoided falling into complete
destitution by receiving remittances from abroad.
17.
Malnutrition i s a serious concern in Haiti with an estimated one in four children under
five (Demographic and Health Survey data 2005-2006) chronically malnourished (stunted)
and one-third suffering from severe malnutrition (wasting). More recently, the food and fuel
price shocks and worldwide economic downturn have likely reduced caloric consumption
and raised malnutrition in the most vulnerable groups: children aged 0-2 years, and pregnant
and nursing mothers. The National Coordination Unit for Food Security (CNSA) reported
that 2.5 million Haitians needed food aid in April 2008. In September, after the storms, the
number had increased to 3.3 million, a third o f the population.
18.

According to the Poverty Profile (2005)4, gender differences do not play a major role

in the overall distribution o f poverty in Haiti. The country has the second highest rate of

female labor force participation (62 percent) in the world (after Lesotho). However, there are
some gender gaps in particular groups and areas: in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, 26
percent o f female-headed households are extremely poor against 17 percent o f male-headed
ones. Within the large informal sector, more than 75 percent o f workers are female. A recent
UNICEF study’ found that a greater proportion o f working women than men fall in the
lowest income bracket in both formal and informal sectors.
19.
In the DNSCRP, the Government prioritizes equality and empowerment for women.
The strategy includes actions to prevent, punish, and eliminate specific forms o f violence
against women. I t also seeks to address laws that still discriminate against women, despite
the existence o f a number o f legal tools, conventions, and international treaties confirming
the equality o f women. Specific government actions include: (i)
reform in judicial and legal
inclusion o f women in
proceedings to fill the legal void as regards the rights o f women; (ii)
legal and judicial entities, including as judges and police officers; and (iii)
harmonization o f
legal provisions to bring them into line with constitutional requirements and international
conventions.

Haiti i s unlikely to meet most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for 2015. The
DSNCRP found little or no progress on the goals related to poverty, hunger, primary
education, child mortality, maternal mortality, and the environment. Haiti has achieved the
goals o f eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education, but school
enrollment overall i s s t i l l very low. Progress has been notable in reducing the incidence o f
HIVIAIDS, roughly halving this over the last decade. Nonetheless, 2.2 percent o f Haitian
adults are HN-positive, the highest national rate outside sub-Saharan Afiica.
D.

ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE, CHALLENGES AND OUTLOOK

i.

Recent Economic Developments

21.
During 2004-07, the Government made progress in stabilizing the economy. The
successful implementation o f macroeconomic policies helped restart economic growth,
reestablish fiscal discipline, reduce inflation and increase international reserves. The
economy gradually recovered from the political turmoil and severe floods experienced in
2004. Real GDP growth is estimated at 3.4 percent for FY076, up from 1.8 percent in FY05,
helped by macroeconomic stability and international economic assistance. Growth was
driven by private consumption, which benefited from the more stable environment and strong
remittances. Public investment also contributed.
22.
The series o f shocks in 2008 (food crisis and hurricanes) threatened macroeconomic
stability and hindered growth, while the five-month political stalemate before the ratification
o f the new Prime Minister severely constrained government operations. Real GDP growth i s
estimated to have slowed to 1.3 percent in FY2008 from 3.4 percent in FY2007. High world
food and fuel prices led to sharply rising inflation and a deteriorating current account
balance. Twelve-month inflation peaked at 19.8 percent in September 2008, up from 7.9
percent in September 2007, but has subsequently declined to 1.O percent in end-March 2009,
on the heels o f rapidly falling international food and fuel prices.
23.
Flooding in August-September 2008 caused extensive food shortages and damage.
The Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), led by the Haitian Government with support
from the World Bank, the Global Facility for Disaster Recovery and Reduction, the UN, and
the European Union (EU) estimated damages and losses at 15 percent o f GDP, with
agriculture, housing, and transportation hardest hit. Over 60 percent o f the harvest was
destroyed. (See Annex E)
24.
The gourde remained broadly stable against the dollar in FY08, while the current
account deficit widened to 2.6 percent o f GDP. The trade deficit deteriorated by 7.5
percentage points o f 2007 GDP (US$463 million), largely because o f higher food and fuel
imports (up by US$434 million). The improved services balance was offset by lower current
transfers than anticipated. The overall balance o f payments remained in surplus ($41.5
million), due in part to PetroCaribe, Venezuela’s program o f supplying o i l o n preferential
terms. Net international reserves rose to US$288 million (or 3 months o f imports) in FY08
from US$269 million in FY07 (or 2.3 months o f imports).

Years in this section refer to the Haitian fiscal year. Thus, FY07 refers to the Haitian Fiscal Year which r u n s
from October 1,2006 to September 30,2007.

7

25.
Budget execution was satisfactory in FY08. Tax revenue was slightly below
expectations due to revenue losses associated with the temporary suspension o f fuel prices
adjustments in response to rising commodity prices. Food and fuel subsidies were
discontinued by October 2008.

ii.

Global Economic Crisis: Impact and Response

26.
The impact o f the global economic crisis i s starting to affect Haiti largely through
lower revenues and declining remittances. GDP growth in FY09 i s expected to come in at
around 2.5 percent. On the fiscal side, the slowdown in economic activity and lower
commodity prices i s decreasing revenues (through reduced VAT and tariffs on imports).
Remittances, which accounted for 19 percent o f GDP in FY08, have started to decline as a
result o f the slowdown in the U S and Canada, where most Haitians abroad live. Migrants’
remittances declined in February 2009 by 5.8 percent year-on-year. Private investment i s
also expected to be l o w given difficult global and domestic conditions. Overall, the current
account deficit including grants i s projected at around 3.5 percent o f GDP for FY09.
Declining world food and energy prices have led to a decline in annual inflation to 1.0
percent in March 2009 from the peak in September 2008.
27.
Haiti’s limited integration with the global financial market has meant that the impact
o f the global financial crisis on the banking sector has been slight to date, though there has
been some increase in dollarization and a slight deterioration in non-performing loans. In
response, the Central Bank has announced an increase in the reserve requirement on U S
dollar-denominated deposits from 3 1 to 34 percent to discourage effective foreign exchange
lending and a slight decrease in the requirement o n gourde deposits (from 30 to 29 percent).
As o f December 2008 the financial sector remained well-capitalized and profitable.
The hurricanes and global economic crisis have increased vulnerability in Haiti. As
28.
noted before, after the storms, the number o f people needing food aid reached 3.3 million, a
third o f the population. The number o f people living in extreme poverty, already high, i s
likely to have increased, as is the number o f malnourished children. Hard data are not
available. The slowdown in remittances i s likely to impact many Haitians who rely on this
source o f income to make ends meet.
29.
The economic impacts o f the global crisis compound - and are difficult to isolate from
- the ongoing impacts o f the shocks o f 2008. The program o f post-storm recovery and
reconstruction activities funded by PetroCaribe savings (around US$220 million) is expected
to primarily finance capital expenditures (75 percent), with the remainder for current
spending. The reconstruction program and a new proposed program to create 100,000 to
150,000 jobs over two years through infrastructure construction (including labor-intensive
works) will provide a fiscal stimulus to counteract the effects o f the global slowdown.
30.
The Government’s FY09 proposed budget allocates a large share o f resources to
social sectors and infrastructure in line with DSNCRP priorities, and proposes to finance
higher expenditures through a combination o f strengthened customs and tax administration
and external support. While the responses are appropriate to a downturn triggered by the
financial crisis, the Government’s ability to put in practice programs large enough to be
effective at turning around the economy is severely constrained by a lack o f funding and the

8

weak implementation capacity o f state institutions. Strong donor support i s therefore critical
to help the Government implement an adequate response.
Despite the negative shocks, macroeconomic stability has been broadly maintained.
3 1.
The IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program is on track.
The fourth review o f the program was completed on February 11, 2009. Program
performance through end-September 2008 remained satisfactory.

iii.

Challenges for Growth and Poverty Reduction’

32.
For Haiti to put the current economic crisis firmly behind it and set out on a path o f
sustainable growth and development requires targeted actions and investments to address
urgent needs, removing key constraints to economic growth and taking full advantage o f the
opportunities available. In addition, as the impact o f the 2008 hurricane season has made
clear, concerted efforts are needed to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and other
shocks, and safeguard progress made so far.
33.
In the short t e r m (18 month horizon), as the Government recognizes, there i s a need
for significant j o b creation, to raise incomes and lay the foundations for social peace. This i s
critical to prevent a resurgence o f the political and social instability that have historically
undermined growth and development in the country. Job creation initiatives should also
focus on interventions that will contribute to improving the conditions for sustainable
private-sector led growth over the long term.
34.
Two promising drivers o f growth, as identified in recent Government strategy
documents, are agriculture and manufacturing, particularly textiles. Maximizing the growth
potential o f these sectors, and stimulating private sector activity and investment more
generally, requires strategic efforts to address principal obstacles to investment and business
activity. With so many bottlenecks to address (see Annex Ifor more detail on sectoral
issues), the challenge i s to identify a few key feasible actions and priorities that will together
have the greatest growth impact.
35.
Agriculture is the main source o f livelihood for 60 percent o f Haitians who live in
rural areas. Agricultural productivity has declined over time due to many factors*, but the
sector has the potential to contribute significantly to growth and poverty reduction. Increased
agricultural production would also strengthen food security, reducing dependence on
imported food and susceptibility to commodity price hikes. There i s also scope to expand
and broaden agricultural exports, which currently include mangoes and essential oils.
Raising agricultural production requires strategic investments in infkastructure, to improve
irrigation and better connect rural areas to markets, as well as supply-side efforts to improve
farming practices and assist under-capitalized farmers through improved access to
This section draws from “Haiti: From Natural Catastrophe to Economic Security, Paul Collier, 2008” as well
as two government documents prepared by the Government o f Haiti ahead o f the April 2009 donor conference:
the main document and a discussion paper, “Haiti: A N e w Paradigm.” These in turn draw on the Collier report,
as well as the DSNCRP and other strategic priorities o f the Government.
8These include: (i)demographic pressure, which have exhausted the supply o f arable land, resulting in
fragmented plots and the settling o f marginal, erosion-prone hillside land; and (ii)
poor farming practices among
typical rural producers: lacking fertilizers, improved seeds, pesticides or complex tools. Soil exhaustion drives
smallholders to fragile upland soils, triggering deforestation, accelerated erosion and fertility depletion, reduced
water retention and silting o f waterways.

agricultural inputs. I t also requires a strengthened sector institutional framework to
coordinate these efforts.
36.
The textile sector has a unique economic opportunity with the HOPE I1 Act, which
gives duty-free, quota-free access to the American market for the next nine years. Haiti i s
well placed in some aspects to exploit this. Its labor costs are fully competitive with China,
and there remains some sectoral expertise and skilled labor in the sector, which has declined
sharply since the 199Os, but was previously strong. Haiti i s also located close to its main
market, the US. Taking advantage o f HOPE I1 will require a good environment to attract
private sector investments, and investments to improve logistics, the business environment
and (most importantly) infrastructure. Government support for private sector participation
for the renovation and upgrading o f ports and airports is essential for the realization o f HOPE
I1opportunities. While addressing infrastructure shortcomings o n a national scale would be a
mammoth task, the expansion and creation o f special industrial zones with supporting
infrastructure (e.g. water and sanitation, electricity) would facilitate targeted improvements.
Improving skills training, for managers and textile workers, would also be essential. (See
B o x 4 for WBG support in this area).
Along with the poor condition o f major roads and ports, a major infrastructure
37.
weakness that needs to be addressed i s the inadequate electricity system. Electricity i s
unreliable, and expensive, while coverage i s poor. Furthermore, support for the sector i s a
serious fiscal drain. The Government i s making progress to address the issues, with donor
support. Major additional efforts are needed, including investments and repairs, as well as
reforms to improve efficiency and governance in the sector.

38.
Over the longer term, major investments in human capital are needed, particularly in
education, to sustain economic growth and development. Education indicators are among the
lowest in the region. Only 71 percent (or as few as 55 percent, by some estimates) o f children
aged 6-12 are enrolled in school. In addition, the quality o f the education system in Haiti is
poor. The Government i s working to enhance the quality o f education and other basic
services and build human capital, which will contribute over time to creating a more
productive and competitive workforce.
iv.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework, 2009-12

39.
This medium-term macroeconomic framework for FY09-12 takes into account the
growth challenges and opportunities posed by the global economic crisis. Table 1 outlines
the macroeconomic framework. The macroeconomic framework i s currently being updated
and will be finalized in May. Prior to the Board discussion o f the CAS, a note updating the
macroeconomic developments will be circulated.
40.

The key assumptions are:
Growth: Real F Y 0 9 GDP growth i s now projected at around 2.5 percent, though this
i s expected to be revised downward, increasing gradually to 3.3 percent by FY12. The
projections assume investments in agriculture, roads and electricity, and some
positive effects from HOPE I1being felt gradually. Over time these investments are
expected to lay the foundations for stronger growth.

10

Inflation: Inflation i s projected to fall to a period average o f 5-6 percent by FY12,
reflecting both the fall in commodity prices and prudent fiscal and monetary policy.
The external current account deficit (including grants) i s projected at around 3-4
percent o f GDP. Exports o f goods and services decreased significantly in FY08 and
are expected to fall in FY09 to 10.6 percent o f GDP, and recover afterwards. Imports
o f goods and services, after jumping in FY08 to 40 percent o f GDP, due largely to
high o i l and food prices, are projected to fall to 38.5 percent o f GDP in FY09, and to
average 37.5 percent o f GDP for FY10-12. Private transfers (mainly remittances) are
set to decrease in FY09 to 16 percent o f GDP due to the effects o f the international
financial crisis before recovering to about 17 percent o f GDP for FY10-12.
Fiscal accounts: The central Government overall fiscal deficit (including grants) i s

programmed to average about 3.3 percent o f GDP over FY09-12.
Central
government revenue (excluding grants) is projected to increase to 11.5 percent o f
GDP by FY12 up from 9.9 percent in FY08.

Despite the Government’s commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies,
significant risks remain. They may compromise recent hard-won macroeconomic gains and
alter the medium-term macroeconomic and financial outlook. The main risks include political
and social instability, linked to the elections; ever present vulnerability to external shocks,
including weather-related ones; and a more prolonged global crisis than presently anticipated.

v.

Debt Sustainability

42.
In November 2005 Haiti qualified for debt relief under the Enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Country Initiative (E-HIPC) by reaching the decision point. Haiti has received
interim relief from multilateral creditors under the E-HIPC initiative. I t i s working to fulfill
the remaining floating completion point triggers by mid-2009. Upon reaching completion
point, Haiti will benefit from HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) debt relief
on an irrevocable basis.
Box 1: Public Debt Sustainability: Main Findings of the L I C DSA
Haiti’s public debt as of end-September 2008 i s estimated at about 29 percent of GDP. Most debt i s
owed to external creditors (25 percent o f GDP), mainly the Inter-American Development Bank (42 percent o f
total external debt), the World Bank (34 percent), and bilateral creditors (15 percent). Most domestic public
debt corresponds to Central Bank gourde-denominated obligations to the domestic banking system.
I n the baseline scenario, public debt indicators increase initially and then decline during the projection
period. Higher loan disbursements in FY2009 worsen the expected path o f Haiti’s debt ratios. The net
present value (NPV) o f debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 20 percent in 2012 before falling to 16 percent by 2028.
The NPV o f debt-to-revenue has a similar profile, reaching 134 percent in 20 11 before falling to 93 percent by
2028. Debt service-to-revenue rises to 9 percent in 2015 before falling to 8 percent by 2028.
Alternative and shock scenarios put public debt on a steadily rising path throughout the projection
period. Instead o f falling as under the baseline scenario, if growth i s one standard deviation lower in 2008
and 2009, the NPV o f public debt-to-GDP ratio would grow to 34 percent in 2028 from 19 percent in 2008,
while the NPV o f public debt-to-revenue ratio would rise to 192 percent from 134 percent. Debt service-torevenue would rise but then remain flat under a growth shock. Keeping the primary balance at the 2008 level
would lead to all public debt indicators rising consistently over the projection period. Using historical
scenarios again yield lower debt levels.
Debt relief at HIPC Completion Point would substantially improve Haiti’s debt situation, but the debtto-export ratio would remain just below the threshold throughout the projection period. Under a
scenario assuming that HIPC completion point and associated MDRI relief materialize in FY09, the NPV o f
the external debt-to-exports ratio would fall below Haiti’s indicative debt burden threshold o f 100 percent in
the medium-term immediately, and would remain just below the threshold throughout the projection period,
indicating high vulnerability to most likely shocks.
Source: World Bank and IMF staff calculations.

43.
The updated Bank-Fund Low-Income (LIC) Country Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA), based on end-September 2008 data’, indicates that Haiti’s risk o f debt distress
remains high, but would decline substantially at HIPC Completion Point (see B o x 1). Haiti’s
weak export base i s a key factor in i t s high risk o f debt distress. An alternative scenario
reflecting full delivery o f HIPC and MDRI relief in 2009, when HIPC i s expected to reach
Completion Point, shows that Haiti’s debt would remain below i t s indicative thresholds
throughout the projection period. The debt-to-exports ratio remains just below the threshold
over the projection period, highlighting vulnerability to external shocks.

The D S A i s being updated in the context o f the HIPC Completion Point.

12

44.
Debt r e l i e f would contribute to creating fiscal space for much needed poverty-related
expenditures. The Government will continue to seek concessional external financing and i s
committed to further strengthening i t s debt management capacity to maintain debt
sustainability after the delivery o f the HIPC Initiative and MDRI assistance. With support
from U N C T A D and the World Bank, Haiti i s creating a single external database that will
facilitate information sharing between the Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF) and the
Central Bank. In addition, Haiti i s working with the Center for Latin American Monetary
Studies (CEMLA) to enhance debt management capacity.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

A. COUNTRY PRIORITIES AND AGENDA

i.

Haiti's National Strategy, the DSNCRP": Priorities and Progress

45.
The Government completed the DSNCRP in November, 2007. I t was prepared
through a participatory process including consultations with civil society, officials, and
development partners. The DSNCRP presents the Government's long-term vision to foster
growth, reduce poverty, and raise living standards. I t envisions an ambitious program o f
institutional reform and substantial public investment through 2010.
46.
The DSNCRP identifies four major challenges for the country to address: (i)
making
a concerted effort to attain the MDGs by moving toward more meaningful social
creating a modern, competitive economy with a balanced regional base, to
development; (ii)
modernizing the state, through greater efforts
increase competitiveness within the region; (iii)
to update and reshape the public management system; and (iv) making full use o f cultural
creativity, historical heritage, and the Diaspora.
The DSNCRP has three strategic pillars. These are: (i)
promoting four vectors (i.e.
drivers) of growth: agriculture and rural development; tourism; infrastructure; and science,
enhancing human development, with a focus o n improving
technology and innovation; (ii)
delivery o f basic services; and (iii)
strengthening democratic governance, particularly by

47.

improving security and the justice system. The DSNCRP also emphasizes the importance o f
a stable macroeconomic framework and sound management o f public resources. Further
details on the government program are described under the CAS pillars (pages 23-3 1).

48.
In addition to these pillars, the DSNCRP includes 10 cross-cutting policies
strategies. These are for: (i)
food security; (ii)
gender equality; (iii)
the environment;
social protection; (v) culture and communication; (vi) urban development; (vii) town
regional planning; (viii) disaster risk reduction; (ix) strengthening government capacity;
(x) a general fiamework o f support to the private sector.

implementation has faced numerous challenges arising from exogenous shocks (high
international food and o i l prices, hurricanes in August and September 2008, and the ongoing
global financial crisis). These events led the Government to shift priorities to attend to urgent
humanitarian needs and the rehabilitation o f physical infrastructure, and to minimize the
impact o f the food and o i l price increases on the purchasing power o f the poor. Meanwhile,
weak state capacity to generate statistics i s a major obstacle to assessing results.

ii.

Emerging Strategic Priorities: the 18-Month Priority Program

50.
Ahead o f the April 2009 donor conference, the Government prepared an 18-month
priority program (through September 2010), based on the DSNCRP but also reflecting new
strategic’ imperatives. The program seeks to maintain stability, safeguard the progress
already achieved, escape the current crisis, and ensure that the country continues o n a path
balance public finances;
towards economic security. I t calls for immediate measures to: (i)
(ii)create jobs rapidly; (iii)reduce vulnerability to natural disasters; (iv) stimulate the
economy; and (v) maintain access to basic services (health and education). I t also outlines
proposals to strengthen development coordination, summarized in Section VI.
51.
At the heart o f the new Government strategy is a plan to create 100,000-150,000 new
jobs over 18-24 months to raise incomes and lay the foundations for social peace. The
majority o f new jobs will initially be created in the construction sector through targeted
infrastructure projects that lay the groundwork for rapid employment generation in
agriculture and manufacturing. Given that each paid worker in Haiti supports o n average four
dependents these new jobs will directly impact up to 600,000 people. The program includes a
set o f specific investment projects for which the Government seeks total donor funding of
close to US$1 billion.
52.
At the conference, donors pledged US$324 million in new funds behind the
Government’s program, in addition to the US$2-3 billion already committed behind the
DSNCRP, some o f which has been reallocated behind the priority program. Additional
budget support for Haitian FY09 reached around US$47 million, well short o f the US$125
million requested but apparently enough to effectively fill the financing gap (around US$50
million) in the budget as now formulated. The WBG expressed strong support for the
priority program and the strategy that underpins it, and announced additional IDA funding o f
US$20 million. In addition, recent portfolio realignment has put a further US$13 million o f
IDA support directly behind the program: the US$5 million Emergency School
Reconstruction project (approved in March 2009); as well as projects in preparation for
Strengthening the Management o f Agriculture Public Services (US$5 million) and additional
financing for the ongoing Electricity Loss Reduction project (US$3 million).

A.

BANK GROUP PROGRAM IN HAITI SINCE 2003

OVERVIEW OF WORLD

BANKACTIVITIESSINCE 2003

53.
The WBG’s current engagement with Haiti began in 2003, initially through two Post
Conflict Fund (PCF) grants. In 2004 the Bank played a central role in the preparation o f the
Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF), the needs assessment and priority development
program led by the Transitional Government. Bank support for Haiti for FY05 and FY06
was guided by the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which was aligned with the ICF. The
14

TSS was discussed by the Board in January 2005, at which time IDA support for the country
resumed, with the clearance o f Haiti’s arrears.
54.
The Bank’s support for Haiti since re-engagement has embodied lessons learnt from
Bank support to fragile states worldwide, including the institution’s earlier experiences in
Haiti. Some o f these lessons are set out in B o x 2 below.
Box 2: Selected Lessons f r o m W o r l d B a n k Experience in Fragile States
1. Focus first on building the legitimacy of the state. Legitimacy i s not just achieved through elections or
power-sharing agreements, but through perfonnance in delivering services, especially visible ones.
2. Provide security. Given the linkages between breakdowns in the economy and stability, security and
development need to go hand in hand, mutually reinforcing each other.

3. Ensure economic stability as a foundation for growth and opportunity. Get the fundamentals right (fiscal,
monetary and exchange rate policies) and provide quick, flexible support to counter shocks.
4. Crowd in the private sector. A healthy private sector i s the engine o f recovery.
5 Recognize the long-term commitment. These are not quick-fix counties. Funding mechanisms need to
ensure continuity and stability o f resources over a decade or more.
6. Operations should be small, simple, and well-defined, with modest objectives. Small pilots funded by trust
funds are a useful way to test models, which can later be scaled up with IDA resources if successful.

7. Build strong partnerships at the national and community levels, to ensure that projects are adapted to the
local context and enjoy support from the population.
8. Channel social services through the private and voluntary sector if state institutions are too weak, with
safeguards to promote adequate quality and access by the poor, and parallel efforts to strengthen the state
capacity to implement i t s core functions.
Sources: ‘Securing Development” speech by Bank President Robert B. Zoellick to US Institute of Peace,
Januaiy 8, 2009 (nos.1. 1-5); Haiti 2002 Country Assistance Evaluation (nos. 6-8).

55.
During the period covered by the TSS, six operations totaling US$131 million were
presented to the Board under the scaled-up scenario, with all key performance indicators met.
In addition, Haiti benefited from approximately US$11.6 million worth o f LICUS and PostConflict grants in areas such as school feeding, economic governance, natural disaster
management, rapid j o b creation through labor intensive pilot initiatives, and emergency basic
health interventions. The AAA program included the CEM, a Country Social Analysis
(CSA)”, an Agricultural and Rural Development Strategy, and a Social Protection Policy
Note. 2
56.
The Interim Strategy Note (FY07-FY08), discussed by the Board in January 2007,
was based on the twin pillars that had also guided the TSS: (i)delivering hope to the
population by helping the Government deliver quick wins in basic service provision and j o b
creation; while (ii)restoring credibility to Haitian institutions by deepening reforms that
promote long-term good governance and institutional development.
57.
The I S N envisioned a US$68 million program o f five IDA grants for FY07. All F Y 0 7
operations were approved as planned: the US$6 million Electricity Loss Reduction Project;
Social Resilience and State Fragility in Haiti, A Country Social Analysis, 2006
o f TSS implementation are included in the ISN.

the US$23 million Second Economic Governance Reform (EGRO 11) project; the US$6
million Rural Water and Sanitation Project; the US$9 million Catastrophe R i s k Insurance
Project; and the US$25 million Education for All (EFA) project.

58.
For FY08, new IDA support exceeded the ISN’s projection o f US$12.9 million,
which was earmarked for a single urban operation. An above-projection IDA allocation o f
US$21 million and regional IDA reallocation following Tropical Storm Noel (October 2007)
raised IDA approvals for the year to US$29 million, through three projects: US$7.4 million
o f additional financing for the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project
(ERDMP); the US$6 million Meeting Teacher Needs for EFA Project; and the US$15.7
million Urban Community Driven Development Project. In addition, the Bank approved a
US$lO million grant (supplemental financing for EGRO 11) via the Global Food Price Crisis
Response Program in M a y 2008.
59.
Additional approvals o f grants from Bank-administered Trust Funds in FY07 and
FY08 reached US$2.3 million. This comprised U S $ l . l million from the Avian Influenza
Prevention and Control Facility (later cancelled); US$O.9 million from the LICUS Trust
Fund to support a joint MINUSTAH-World Bank initiative to rehabilitate infrastructure in
the volatile Port-au-Prince neighborhood o f Martissant; and US$0.4 million from the
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) for strengthening local training capacity for donor
project implementation.
During the I S N period the Bank delivered four major pieces o f AAA. The Public
60.
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) was produced
jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in FY07. In FY08, the Bank
delivered: the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) with the IMF; the Report o n the
Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC), covering accounting and auditing practices;
and the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing o f Terrorism Assessment.
Technical Assistance included the inventory and valuation o f the technical assets o f national
electricity company Electricit6 d’Hai’ti (EDH), with EU funding, as well as the IFC-financed
financial audit o f EDH in FY07 with Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
funding.
B.

SELECTED RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER THE I S N

61.
The Bank’s program attained all results targeted by the I S N for achievement by the
end o f FY08. Given the relative youth o f the portfolio, the I S N aimed for modest results.
These came primarily through the two most advanced IDA investment projects: the US$38
million C D D Project and the US$12 million ERDMP, both approved in FY05. In addition,
strong support for the Government’s economic governance reform program contributed to
positive outcomes in this area. A summary o f performance against those specific targets is
included in Annex G, along with a broader, more illustrative view o f I S N achievements,
including other sectors and trust fund grants, by pillar.
C.

PORTFOLIOPERFORMANCE

62.
To date, the World Bank portfolio in Haiti has performed well, with development
objectives and implementation progress o f all active projects rated satisfactory. With the
which closed in March 2006, all IDA projects approved since the 2005
exception o f EGRO I,
16

re-engagement remain active, many o f them at an early implementation stage. Despite a
challenging implementing environment, Haiti’s disbursement ratio for FY08 was strong (23
percent vs. 25 percent and 22 percent at the regional and Bank-wide levels respectively).
While, as o f March 30, 2009, 60 percent o f the portfolio was rated “at risk”, i f the two risk
flags that affect the whole portfolio (country environment and country record) are
discounted, only one project would be rated as unsatisfactory. This would be EGTAG 11,
because o f delayed implementation. Two other projects have two additional flags: Rural
Water and Sanitation (for monitoring and evaluation and counterpart fbnding) and Electricity
Loss Reduction (effectiveness delay and slow disbursement).
63.
An impasse over the correct ratification procedure for IDA grants delayed
effectiveness o f all projects approved by IDA during FY07 until a solution was agreed with
the Government and National Assembly in July 2007. For FY08 approvals the effectiveness
delay dropped to 4.8 months from 7.1 the previous year.
64.
In June 2008, the Bank and the Haitian Government conducted the first Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in recent years. The two-day workshop included
Government ministers, officials, project teams and Bank staff. Implementation progress was
assessed as generally satisfactory, with improvements identified for three areas: fiduciary;
communication and Government oversight; and monitoring and evaluation. Action plans
were developed. Specific commitments included: additional training o f fiduciary staff in
project implementation u n i t s in procurement and financial management, reduction o f delays
in reviewing requests for no objection, inclusion o f the MEF in the selection process o f
projects audit firms, regular meeting o f project managers for peer learning, the publication o f
a newsletter, and inclusion o f communication aspects in project activities. These agreed
actions are being implemented satisfactorily and monitored jointly by the World Bank
Country Office and the MEF. The next CPPR has been scheduled for M a y 2009.

THEIFC IN HAITISINCE 2004

65.
I F C has supported the Government’s priorities o f promoting economic growth and
improving access to quality basic services, particularly for the most vulnerable groups. I F C
has ramped up its activities in Haiti in the past two years, and established a full-time presence
in the country, with three staff in its country office, co-located in the World Bank office.
66.
IFC activities have focused on four key areas: the financial sector, infrastructure,
textiles, and investment climate. I F C worked closely with IDA and the donor community to
identify targeted and concrete actions that: (i)
support the development o f a sustainable private
sector and resulting in income generating activities; and ii)help improve the business climate in
infrastructure, access to finance, and SMEs.

IFC made five investments in Haiti during 2000-07 for a total o f US$47 million:
Digicel I & 11. In F Y 0 6 and FY07 I F C provided two loans o f US$15 million each to
support the establishment and expansion o f Digicel’s infrastructure and services in the
country. This investment has resulted in significant impacts (e.g. an increase in mobile
penetration from 375,000 in 2006 prior to Digicel’s entry to over 3 million in 2009).
Capital Bank, S.A. IFC approved in early M a y 2007 a US$3.0 million trade finance line
to Capital Bank, Haiti’s third largest bank.

CODEVI Textile Park. I F C provided a US$14 million loan in F Y 0 4 to Grupo Mya
garment manufacturer in neighboring Dominican Republic, to establish the C O D E V I
textiles industrial park in Ouanaminthe, Haiti. Today, C O D E V I employs around 3,500
Haitian workers and is expected to continue to grow.
Micro Credit National (MCN). IFC invested equity with private sector partners to
establish Micro Credit National (MCN), Haiti’s first private sector microfinance
institution. By the time I F C sold i t s equity in M C N in 2006, M C N had extended a total o f
around US$40 million in small loans to Haitian micro entrepreneurs and SMEs. M C N
continues to be a leading microfinance institution in Haiti today.

68.
Inthe financial sector, IFC addresses challenges including banks’ risk aversion through
investment and advisory activities, strengthening financial institutions and improving access to
finance, particularly for micro entrepreneurs and SMEs. For example, IFC is providing advisory
services to Haiti’s largest bank, Sogebank, S.A., to create a dedicated S M E unit. It is also
providing ongoing advisory support to the Central Bank to establish a credit bureau
69.
To improve Haiti’s inadequate infrastructure, IFC focused on enhancing private sector
participation, attracting foreign investment and ‘know-how’ , and assisting the Government in
improving capacity. IFC has two advisory mandates to: (i)
assist in developing a private sector
participation solution for the main airports; and (ii)
structure and implement the privatization o f
the state-owned fixed line telecom operator TELECO. In addition, IFC has started training and
capacity buildingfor SMEs.

E.

LESSONS
FROM PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION SINCE FY05

70.
Additional lessons, set out below, have been drawn f i o m the experience o f recent
program implementation, the ISN, feedback from task and project teams, implementation
status reports, Independent Evaluation Group reports, the 2007 and 2009 Haiti cluster risk
reviews, and the IDA Conditionality Consultations in Port-au-Prince (October 7,2007).

i.

Overall Engagement and Focus

7 1.
Close engagement at the political level and sensitivity to political arrangements and
forces remain central. The impasse over the correct ratification procedure for IDA grants
delayed effectiveness o f many projects for several months in 2007. W h i l e greater
communication and flexibility on either side might have shortened the delay, ultimately the
productive working relationship between the Bank, the Government and the legislature
facilitated a solution.

72.
Eflective economic governance reform requires strong practical support for reform
implementation, in addition to policy recommendations and conditions. The significant
progress Haiti has achieved under programs backed by the first and second Economic
Governance Reform Operations (EGRO Iand 11) has been facilitated by technical assistance
grants. However, sectoral capacity o f key line ministries o n financial management and
procurement is yet to be developed.
73.
Development policy operations must be sensitive to institutional constraints. Weak
vertical and horizontal coordination among and within government units increases the need
for broad participation in the process o f establishing, implementing and monitoring
18

conditionality. Central departments may not be in a position to drive or monitor progress in
other areas o f government.

74.
Delivering quick, visible results and institution-building: complements not
alternatives. The country’s continuing fragility supports the need to maintain the basic twopronged approach o f the TSS and ISN, combining: (i)
support for the Government in the
delivery.of quick visible results (in terms o f basic services and j o b creation); with (ii)
longer
term efforts to strengthen Haitian public institutions. However, these themes are
mainstreamed across this CAS rather than being pillars, to instill the more integrated focus
that has been shown to be appropriate.

75.
Greater focus on stimulating private sector activity and economic growth is needed,
in response to Haiti’s slow recent growth, and still-muted private sector activity. The I F C
will continue to lead WBG support in this area, including in improving the business
environment. In addition, the Bank will seek to provide technical assistance and selective
investments in infrastructure, and possibly agriculture and logistics, to address bottlenecks
and other constraints to private sector activity.

ii.

Project Design, Preparation and Supervision

76.
While operational and fiduciary risks are high, they can be successfully mitigated.
The Bank has taken a proactive approach to risk mitigation at the project-level by providing
extensive capacity building activities, while agreeing o n conservative fiduciary arrangements
(i.e. ring-fencing) that facilitate monitoring and transparency.

77.

Intensive supervision is essentialfor both investment projects and development policy
operations. This requires not just adequate supervision budgets for Washington-based staff,
but a larger Bank Group presence in the country. The Bank and I F C have recently expanded
staffing in Port-au-Prince.

78.
Capacity-building requires close follow-up and support as well as training. For
fiduciary issues in particular, training has proven more effective if reinforced by extra
support, enabling capacity to strengthen through experience o n the job.
’

79.
Strong coordination and communication across the WBG portfolio are especially
important in a challenging operating environment. Weak capacity and coordination among
implementing units and counterparts increase the need for cross-portfolio problem-solving
and capacity-strengthening initiatives, lesson-sharing and the exploitation o f synergies
between different projects.

A.

PROPOSED ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR FYO9-FY12

OVERVIEW OF THE STRATEGY

80.
The C A S has three pillars: (i)
promoting growth and local development; (ii)
investing
in human capital; and (iii)
reducing vulnerability to disasters. Cutting across the strategy is a
two-pronged approach, combining longer-term institution building (including economic
governance reform) with support for the Government in the delivery o f quick, visible results.
19

8 1.
Within these areas, new World Bank Group interventions will be determined by: (i)
Haitian priorities, primarily as expressed in the DSNCRP; (ii)
areas in which Bank projects
WBG areas o f comparative advantage; and (iv) other donor
already achieve progress; (iii)
activities to fill gaps or leverage investments from other donors or the private sector.
82.
The World Bank and the I F C are cementing a closer partnership in Haiti, through
jointly preparing this CAS. The organizations will seek out fbrther opportunities for
synergies and cooperation in Haiti, notably on advancing the HOPE I1agenda.
83.
The WBG will provide Haiti with multi-faceted, versatile assistance during the CAS
period. This includes: intellectual support and policy advice; coordinating, harmonizing, and
catalyzing assistance; regional and international linkages; and flexibility and rapid response
(See B o x 3). Maximizing WBG synergies will broaden WBG coverage and impact.
Box 3: Key Elements of Bank Group Support for Haiti
Intellectual support and policy advice. Since 2004, the Bank has undertaken extensive country analysis,
which underpins policy dialogue and assistance, as well as providing direct input into government policy
and the design of other donors’ programs. In addition to in-depth analytical and advisory activities (AAA),
the Bank will aim to provide more just-in-time, focused, advisory support on emerging issues.
Coordinating, harmonizing, catalyzing. The Bank w i l l continue to play an active role in donor
coordination and harmonization, in support o f the MPCE’s leadership o f aid coordination. I t will continue
to be active in coordination and collaboration at the international level to catalyze support for Haiti. The
Bank w i l l continue to mobilize trust fund resources as well as co-financing from other donors. In addition,
the Bank will explore further possibilities for channeling Diaspora funding for Haiti’s developmenti3.
Regional and international linkages. The Bank’s involvement in other Caribbean states helps i t to connect
Haiti with regional initiatives and analysis. The Bank aims to assist Haiti and the Dominican Republic in
addressing island-wide issues through the preparation o f a bi-national CEM. T h e implementation o f Avian
Influenza and disaster management activities in both countries are other opportunities for bi-national
collaboration. In addition, the Bank’s international reach and membership helps it assist Haiti in learning
lessons from other countries, including through South-South cooperation. The Bank and the Government o f
Brazil are working to prepare joint initiatives in Haiti.
Flexibility and rapid response. The Bank retains flexibility to respond to emergencies and mobilize trust
fund resources in Government priority areas, even if these are not main IDA focus areas in t h i s CAS.
Proposed project allocations may be adjusted or projects restructured to free funds to respond to
emergencies. Streamlined O P B P 8.0 processing rules allow for the preparation and approval o f emergency
response projects within weeks. T h e Bank has been successful in mobilizing additional resources quickly
in emergencies, from IDA and trust funds. T h e GFDRR offers a channel to raise funds from its member
donors quickly, in case o f future urgent need.

i.

IDA Funding

84.
Total IDA allocations for FY09-FY12 are projected at roughly US$121 million at
current exchange rates, an average o f US$30 million a year. The basic indicative IDA 15
envelope (FY09-FY 11) i s approximately SDR 48.3 million, or roughly US$72 million at
current exchange rates. In addition, Haiti in FY09 has received an additional US$1.6 million
reallocation (from earlier cancelled IDA fimds) for Avian Flu prevention and control, and an
l3A Boston-based Haitian hometown association i s already providing parallel financing for IDA-supported
C D D activities in the Central Plateau.

20

additional US$20 million under an IDA provision allowing for further funding to respond to
major natural disasters. A further proposed US$20 million allocation under this provision
was announced o n April 14,2009.

85.
This new US$20 million o f IDA funding is expected to be used primarily for
additional budget support (US$9 million, raising a previously planned operation to US$12.5
million) and activities in support o f the Government’s 18-month priority program (up to
US$11 million), through additional financing for existing projects. These operations are
expected early in FY10.
86.
No firm estimate i s available for FY12, the first year o f IDA 16, so this document
assumes a US$7 million allocation, maintaining the FY11 level. The program for FY12 i s
expected to include a budget support operation and additional financing for one or more
investment projects already underway. The program will be more fully developed in the CAS
progress report scheduled for FY11.
87.
IDA allocations have fallen sharply from FY05-FY07, when Haiti received more than
US$60 million per year. The country tapped the maximum o f three exceptional allocations
permitted under IDA 14 for non-post-conflict countries re-engaging with IDA in those years.
FY09 and FYlO include a small phase-out allocation (introduced in IDA 15). N e w
allocations are further reduced by the netting out o f MDRI relief from new IDA allocations,
required by IDA rulesi4. The projections included here assume that MDRI will trigger at the
start o f FY10, following expected HIPC completion point in June.
88.
While Haiti has received all IDA funding since early 2005 in grant form, the county i s
projected to return to a mix o f grants and credits in FYlO following HIPC completion in June
2009. The granting o f HIPC and MDRI relief is likely to reduce the country’s level o f debt
distress below the level that would qualify it for 100 percent grants. The D S A undertaken in
preparation for Completion Point will confirm this.

89.
Emergency response operations in FY09 and FYlO have frontloaded the IDA
pipeline, as requested by the Government. IDA project approvals &e projected to rise from
US$42.6 million in FY09, to US$59.5 million in FY10, before falling to US$12 million in
FY11 and US$7 million FY12. Actual IDA allocations are set to decline even more sharply,
from a final allocation o f US$62 million in FY09 (including US$22 million o f additional
funding) to US$45 million in FYlO (including the new US$20 million post-disaster
allocation), to US$7 million in FY11.
90.
The amounts given for outer years are indicative only. Actual allocations will depend
the country’s o w n performance; (ii)
its performance relative to that o f other IDA
on: (i)
recipients; (iii)
the amount o f overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the l i s t o f
active IDA-eligible countries; (v) terms o f financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and
(vi) the amount o f compensatory resources received for MDRI. Corresponding adjustments
will be made in the size o f future projects to reflect actual funding.

l4While MDRI relief w i l l reduce new IDA allocations, it i s important to note that it will free up considerable
budget resources that the Government w i l l be able to apply to priority areas and i s thus an implicit form o f
budget support.

Priorities and Instruments

IDA funding for budget support and investment projects, AAA, non-lending
Technical Assistance (NLTA) and trust funds will

remain
key elements o f the Bank’s support for
Projected IDA Operations (US$m)
Haiti. For budget support, the Bank aims to
I support implementation o f the Government’s
institutional reform agenda, harmonizing its
support with development partners. The proposed
WBG program o f activities is described in the next
sections. Tables 2 and 3 show proposed IDA
operations and AAA (including FY09 approvals to
date). Annex H presents the entire World Bank

92.
Over the longer term, the Bank will pursue
greater selectivity and focus within the program, to
adjust to falling IDA allocations and consolidate
progress. From mid-FY10 onwards, new IDA
projects are envisioned in just three areas in which
the Bank already has a strong program (CDD,
Education, and Economic Governance). However the current portfolio, including FY09
projects, gives the Bank a strong presence in other sectors this CAS period.
93.
IFC will foster private sector development
through both direct lending and technical assistance.
On the lending side, I F C will focus o n three main
sectors: financial markets (access to finance, micro
lending, SMEs and banking), manufacturing and
infrastructure. Through advisory services, I F C will
support private sector participation in infrastructure,
business skills for SMEs, credit bureau creation, free
trade zones, regulatory reform, investment promotion
and improving the Doing Business indicators. Should
viable opportunities materialize, I F C will also invest in
other growth sectors such as agribusiness and tourism.
94.
I F C expects to invest a total o f US$40-60
million over the CAS period.
Progress on
infrastructure reform (ports, airports, telecom,
electricity) and new investments in textiles will be key
determinants o f the level o f IFC investment. Concrete actions on the part o f the Government
in this area could significantly increase IFC’s investment including its ability to leverage
private sector investment, especially in infrastructure and in support o f HOPE 11.
95.
Given the rapid recent expansion o f the portfolio, its large size relative to the pipeline
o f projects and challenging operating conditions, the successful implementation o f the
current portfolio will remain a key priority for the Bank for the CAS period. Maintaining
22

strong support commensurate with the expansion o f the program, including adequate staffing
o f the county office, will be critical to successful implementation.

B.

CAS PILLAR1- PROMOTING GROWTH
AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

96.
Government Program: This pillar i s consistent with the first pillar o f Haiti’s
DSNCRP, the “Vectors o f Growth”, which emphasizes agriculture and rural development,
and infrastructure.

97.
The DSNCRP sets out a comprehensive plan for agriculture and rural development
that has both an economic aim, in seeking to modernize farms and agricultural enterprises to
increase the productivity o f high-potential zones (irrigated and humid plains, humid
mountains), and a social one, with i t s parallel focus on reducing social polarization through
support for disadvantaged, less-fertile areas. Throughout, the strategy focuses on
redeveloping the rural environment through zoning, diversifying income generation activities
and implementing legal measures (including titling) to preserve development gains and
improve wealth distribution.
98.
For infrastructure, the DSNCRP focuses o n building roads, to create jobs, improve
access to services, and promote balanced regional development. I t aims to develop ports and
airports as a means to increased regional integration and international trade. The strategy also
emphasizes support for the electricity sector, including increasing generation capacity and the
productivity o f existing installations through rehabilitation and better maintenance.
99.
The Government’s priority program focuses on agriculture and manufacturing as the
two main engines o f j o b creation and growth. For agriculture, it highlights natural resource
protection (against erosion) as a key aim, along with growth and poverty reduction. Specific
plans include strategic interventions in irrigation, agricultural inputs and transportation
infrastructure, along with a strengthening o f the public institutions to coordinate such
activities. For manufacturing, the program focuses on capitalizing on the opportunity created
by HOPE 11, including support for the expansion o f industrial parks, and the targeted
infrastructure improvements needed for these. I t aims to rehabilitate three principal highways
connecting major population centers and to strengthen electricity supply, especially for big
industrial consumers. In addition, i t envisions complementary measures to improve the
business environment, including proposals to allow for multi-shift operation and greater
speed and transparency o f customs procedures, and enhancing training for workers.

100. Bank Group Approach: Two main outcomes are pursued under this pillar: (i)
an
increase in income-generating opportunities and better access to finance and infrastructure
an enhanced agriculture sector contribution
services at the local and national levels; and (ii)
to economic growth and local development, through more effective agriculture services.

101. Community Driven Development (CDD) will be a main focus within this pillar. I t has
proven a successful way to deliver visible results (services and income-earning opportunities)
in poor rural and urban areas while building social capital and cementing peace. The C D D
projects are consistent with the DSNCRP’s approach o f targeting rural and urban
development efforts (including the provision o f basic infrastructure) at the most vulnerable.
The Bank has a comparative advantage in C D D approaches in difficult contexts, and has
made strong progress with the program i t has supported in Haiti since 2003. In addition, the
23

Bank’s support for C D D has proved effective at leveraging co-financing from other donors
(Caribbean Development Bank) and parallel Diaspora funding.

102. With the reduced CAS envelope, the Bank does not expect to directly finance largescale infrastructure or agricultural investments, but will focus resources on strategic areas
that tap areas of comparative advantage (such as institutional strengthening), build o n the
progress achieved through projects underway, and leverage h d i n g from other sources. The
Bank already has a close partnership in the electricity sector with the IDB, and in transport
with the EU and the French development agency Agence FranCaise de Dbveloppement
(AFD). Together with IFC, the Bank will also aim for key infrastructure investments that
promote private sector growth and WBG synergies.
103. I F C will seek to facilitate private sector investment, particular export generating
sectors, developing opportunities under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Investments in trade
financing and micro finance will also be supporting rural producers, likely complementing the
C D D project and IDA support to small farmers. Furthermore I F C advisory services will
place a particular effort in improving the business environment, notably to realize
opportunities created by HOPE 11, via a project currently under preparation with the Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS). Progress in strengthening property rights and o n
custom simplification will be key areas to facilitate private sector investment.

104. Competitiveness and HOPE 11: The Bank group aims to provide strong support for
improvements in competitiveness and the business environment, particularly in the context o f
HOPE 11, as well as target investments and advisory assistance to help the Haitian private
sector take advantage o f the great potential benefits o f the HOPE I1A c t (See B o x 4).

105. Agriculture. In light o f the high priority assigned to increasing agricultural
productivity, a US$5 million operation is being prepared to strengthen public services in the
agriculture sector. This will strengthen the Ministry o f Agriculture to enable it to more
effectively utilize its existing budget allocations (from donors and the MEF), strengthening
public services. I F C will seek to leverage the Bank’s work and support private sector
investment, either via direct investment or advisory support.
106. CDD: A second-generation rural C D D project o f US$9 million is envisioned for
FYlO. This project would build o n the success o f the current C D D efforts and increase
support to local authorities while safeguarding the model’s de-politicized approach. In early
2009, additional financing o f US$8 million was processed for the ongoing US$38 million
IDA C D D project, as part o f the Bank’s response to the 2008 storms. In addition, a US$15.7
million Urban C D D project i s underway, effective since late 2008.
107. Transport: Additional financing o f around US$10 million for the ongoing Transport
and Territorial Development Project (US$16 million) is proposed for FYlO to replenish the
funds that were reallocated to emergency reconstruction activities in 2007 following the
passage o f Tropical Storm Noel, as well as to cover an increase in the cost o f road works. A
new US$20 million Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and Vulnerability Reduction Project
was approved by the Board in November 2008. IFC will focus on facilitating private sector
participation in airports, starting with the Port-au-Prince airport where it i s preparing an
advisory mandate. The development and modernization o f ports (e.g. Port-au-Prince, Cap
Haitien) will be essential for the development o f the garment industry, and for rapid j o b
24

creation. IFC i s prepared to support the Government in this area, through facilitating private
sector investment. IFC support will depend o n the Government making these projects a
priority.
Box 4: WBG Support for Competitiveness and HOPE I1
The Opportunity: HOPE I1 i s a significant opportunity for rapid j o b creation in the Ready-Made Garment
(RMG) industry in Haiti. RMG represents 88 percent o f Haiti’s export earnings, 10 percent o f GDP, and
employs in excess o f 20,000 workers, or 8 percent o f the formal sector. Before the 1994 embargo, the sector
employed 100,000 workers, most o f whom were women. IFC’s experience with Grupo M and Codevi in
Ounaminthe have led to the creation o f 3,500 new jobs, most o f them going to women.
T h e Bank and I F C are providing support to the HOPE Commission in facilitating access to HOPE I1
benefits, and seeking improvements in export quality and the competitiveness o f the apparel and textiles
industry. This includes capacity-building at customs and in key ministries to improve apparel trade
facilitation processes and service delivery, and institutional strengthening o f other key government bodies.
Realizing Opportunities created by HOPE 11- A WBG Approach. In the past year the WBG, including
FIAS, has made significant efforts to support HOPE 11. The Group aims to implement a joint approach
through a combination o f investment and advisory interventions focused on five key areas: i)investment
climate, ii)trade facilitation, iii)labor standards and compliance, iv) operational efficiencies and business
skills at the company level and v) leveraging both private sector and donor financing. The multi-pronged
approach seeks to address four main constraints: i)s k i l l s (management and labor) and labor standards
compliance; ii)financing (huge collateral requirements, high interest rates); iii)operational efficiency; and
iv) infrastructure (industrial space, logistics, electricity, water, roads, airports, ports).

H i g h risk perception and the decapitalization o f local companies are major obstacles to private investment,
limiting IFC’s ability to support investments. An effective risk mitigation mechanism, including some
financing via donor support, i s needed.
In advisory activities, I F C i s assisting the Government in (i)
Doing Business Reform to establish short- and
medium-term reforms (progress in strengthening property rights and o n custom simplification would
investment promotion and generation by developing an institutional
facilitate private sector investment), (ii)
strengthening plan for entities involved in FDI promotion and apparel subcontracting, (iii)
industrial space/
economic zones, to address inadequate regulation and lack o f industrial infrastructure and, (iv) helping
improve the labor situation in working with companies, Ministry o f Labor, and labor unions. A FIAS project
supporting these efforts i s currently pending financing (about US$3 million) for i t s implementation.

IFC i s also conducting individual advisory services for local garment companies to enhance
competitiveness. Through the Business Edge program, I F C i s delivering training inbusiness and managerial
s k i l l s to SME owners and mid-level managers in textiles, in agribusiness and services sectors.

108. Energy and Telecommunications. Additional financing o f US$3 m i l l i o n i s proposed
for mid-year 2009 to finance private management services for the public electricity utility
(EDH) to complement the ongoing Electricity Loss Reduction project (US$6 million). In
parallel, IFC will support private investments in electricity. The Bank and IFC will work
together o n finding the best options to facilitate access for the poorest, and find alternatives
which reduce the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, as w e l l as minimizing the impact
o f climate change. There i s potential for Bank support for a national broadband
telecommunications network following on current non-lending technical assistance.
Telecommunications is another area o f Bank/IFC collaboration. IFC has an ongoing advisory
with the Government for the privatization o f the state utility TELECO. IFC support will
depend o n the Government making this project a priority.
Financial Sector. IFC will: (i)
improve access to finance through investments in
109.
microfinance, general bank lending, trade finance, and special projects to support

25

microenterprises and SMEs and priority sectors such as textiles; and (ii)strengthen the
financial sector by engaging with leading financial institutions (including equity
investments). WBG coordination in this area will help improve banking sector penetration,
notably for smaller entrepreneurs and rural producers resulting in income generating
opportunities for poor people. The Bank will also pursue follow-up activities to the recent
FSAP, including strengthened governance, accounting and audit practices (building on the
ROSC completed in FYOS), risk management and reporting in the banking sector. Trust fund
resources, including from the FIRST initiative, will be sought for this work.

C.

CAS PILLAR 2 - INVESTING IN HUMAN
CAPITAL

110. Government Program: This pillar i s based on the second pillar o f Haiti’s DSNCFU?
“Human Development”. The pillar also responds to Government priorities outlined in the
recently endorsed National Strategic Plan for Education for All (SNA). The Government and
the local education donor group presented the S N A to the Education for All Fast-Track
Initiative (EFA-FTI) meeting in April 2008, when Haiti became the 35th country to j o i n the
increase coverage at the prepartnership. The SNA/EPT features five strategic choices: (i)
primary level; (ii)
increase equitable access to formal and non-formal basic education; (iii)
promote greater internal efficiency in the basic education system; (iv) promote greater
external efficiency; and (v) improve sector governance.

111. The Government’s priority plan emphasizes reconstruction o f schools and hospitals,
with the aim o f bringing service delivery back to at least a pre-hurricane level. Specifically, it
aims to rehabilitated 150 schools, build 300 others, construct two model hospitals and
upgrade a medical center.
112. Bank Group Approach: The main outcomes being pursued under this pillar are:
increased access to basic education; improved nutritional security for Haitian children; and
improved access to potable water. These outcomes will be achieved through consolidating
gains and building on results achieved thus far in education, health, social protection and
rural water and sanitation.
113. Education will remain the main focus within this area, given the strong foundations
laid in this area, and i t s rank among Government priorities. The strong policy dialogue that
the Bank has conducted with the Ministry o f Education and other partners since reengaging
in Haiti has uniquely positioned the Bank as a trusted partner. IDA projects have facilitated
sector support by other donors in the education sector, notably the Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) and CIDA, both o f whom co-finance IDA-supported operations.
114. Education: The Bank’s overall aim i s to support the effective implementation o f the
SNA. The Bank will focus on the first two strategic choices, which relate to increasing the
enrollment o f Haitian children at the primary and pre-primary levels with the view o f
reaching the 2015 goal o f universal primary education. Projects will focus on restoring or
rebuilding schools; (ii)
providing tuition waivers
increasing access to schooling through: (i)
increasingly the supply o f trained teachers. The first education
for poor families; and (iii)
project under the new CAS period i s the US$5 million Emergency School Reconstruction
Project (ESRP), approved in March 2008. A follow-on project, the second phase o f the
adaptable programmatic grant (APG) program launched with the US$25 million F Y 0 7

26

Education for All project, i s envisaged for FY11. A further IDA project (US$6 million)
underway supports teacher training.

115. Business skills for SMEs. Most SMEs in IDA countries have poor management skills
that limit their ability to design and implement sound business strategies. This has a negative
impact on their productivity, efficiency and business growth. Overall, there is a lack o f
access to professional training providers that properly address S M E training needs. I F C will
make use o f its Business Edge program to help build SMEs business skills.
116. Social Protection and Nutrition. In response to a Government request to explore
options for strengthening nutritional security among Haitian children, the Bank has begun a
two-year program o f non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) for Haiti, in partnership with
the World Food Program (WFP) and other organizations. For nutritional security, the Bank’s
technical assistance project has served to convene all major actors, facilitating strategic
discussions about the sector. Although the envelope to date i s modest, the work is high
profile, and the Bank is quickly developing a comparative advantage in this area.
Water Supply and Sanitation: The Bank supports efforts to improve drinking water
117.
and sanitation in rural areas through a US$5 million IDA grant approved in 2007, and a
US$5 million State and Peace-Building Fund (SPF) grant approved in 2009. These are
implemented in close partnership with the IDB, which finances a US$15 million scaled-up
program.

118. The Bank actively seeks to harmonize approaches between the rural water and
sanitation project, the C D D project and the disaster management project at the level o f local
communities and o f implementing agencies. Expected benefits include the introduction o f
more sustainable management practices into water and sanitation C D D projects, more
transparent and participatory local-level decision-making, and the integration o f local disaster
vulnerability assessment in the designs o f water systems.
D.

CAS PILLAR 3 - REDUCING
VULNERABILITYTO DISASTERS

119. Government Program: This pillar aligns with the DSNCRP cross-cutting theme o f
risk reduction and disaster mitigation. I t also reflects the PDNA and the National
Reconstruction and Economic Recovery Program, which identifies reduction o f vulnerability
to natural disasters as a central component. The action plan and recommendations presented
in the PDNA provide a roadmap for Haiti’s transit from a country “living at risk” to a
country living with risk”. The transversal nature o f vulnerability reduction and risk
management necessitates a multi-sectoral approach.
120. The Government’s priority plan highlights the importance o f reducing vulnerability to
natural disasters. I t envisions targeted interventions to protect areas affected badly by the
2008 storms: Gonaives, Cabaret, Leogane, Jacmel and certain areas o f Port-au-Prince. These
interventions include watershed management and river management, to reduce the risk o f
erosion and flooding.
121. Bank Group Approach: T w o main outcomes are pursued under this pillar: (i)
strengthened institutional capacity for disaster preparation, response and recovery; and (ii)
integration o f vulnerability reduction and risk management into national, sectoral and local
development strategies and programs.
27

122. Reduction o f vulnerability to natural disasters will remain the principal focus within
this area, given the strong existing Bank program in this area, i t s rank among Government
priorities and the technical and strategic support resources available within the WBG, which
give i t a strong comparative advantage.
123. Reducing Vulnerabilities. Bank-financed projects since the 2008 hurricanes integrate
vulnerability reduction and risk management in their development objectives, notably the
Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and Vulnerability Reduction Project, and the Emergency
School Reconstruction Project.

124. Disaster Risk Management. In response to the damage caused by Hurricane Dean and
Tropical Storms Noel and Olga in 2007, IDA approved an additional financing o f US$7.4
million grant for the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project, taking the total
to US$19.4 million. The Bank i s also seeking a South-South Facility Knowledge Exchange
trust fund grant o n disaster management.
125. Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). GFDRR has
identified Haiti as one o f five priority countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. I t
supported a recent analysis o f disaster risk management policies and activities and will
finance a significant scaling up o f the disaster risk management program in Haiti going
forward. GFDRR in April 2009 approved a US$500,000 grant to improve inter-ministerial
coordination o f vulnerability reduction and risk management activities.
126. Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project. Haiti i s a member o f the Caribbean Catastrophe
Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) which reduces countries’ financial vulnerability to
catastrophic events by providing immediate liquidity after a severe hurricane or earthquake.
Haiti’s participation in the CCRIF was initially supported by an IDA grant o f US$9 million
approved in FY07. The US$1.45 million o f IDA funds remaining in the grant ahead o f the
2009 hurricane season only cover part o f the year’s premium. C I D A has agreed to hnd the
remaining U S $ l .12 million.
127. Improving environmental management. Haiti’s environmental degradation is a major
factor in its vulnerability to natural disasters. Over the past two decades, water catchment
areas in most o f the country’s main watersheds have been rapidly deforested and degraded,
leading to extensive erosion and increased potential for floods. As climate change i s expected
to exacerbate current stresses on water resources and land cover, there i s an urgent need for
improved environmental management and integrated watershed management. In addition,
Haiti has the highest rate o f under-five child mortality and morbidity in the region, associated
with poor environmental health conditions. A country environmental analysis i s proposed for
FYlO to address these issues. The Bank will also actively seek to facilitate Haiti’s access to
climate change adaptation funds.
128. Avian Influenza. A grant for US$1.6 million from IDA was approved in 2008 to
support Government efforts to prevent and control the Avian Flu virus.

E.

CROSS-CUTTING THEMES:
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENINGAND RESULTS

129. This area combines longer-term institution building (including economic governance
reform) with support for the Government in the delivery o f quick, visible results.
28

130. Government Program: The D S N C W cross-cutting theme o f modernizing the state
focuses on strengthening the capacity o f the state including human resource development,
reforms to improve public service delivery at central and decentralized levels, and
modernization o f the administration.
131. The delivery o f quick visible results i s at the center o f the Government’s priority
program, which seeks to create 100,000-150,000 new jobs over 18-24 months to raise
incomes and lay the foundations for social peace. The DSNCRP places appropriate emphasis
on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) o f the results.
132. Bank Group approach: The WBG’s two-pronged approach builds on the ISN, which
focused o n two pillars: (i)
delivering hope to the population through quick wins in the areas
o f basic services and job creation; and (ii)
restoring credibility in public institutions through
reforms that promote longer-term economic governance and institutional development. In
mainstreaming these themes, the new CAS adopts a more integrated focus that i s geared
toward strengthening the Government’s ability to deliver visible results to the population.
While there has been progress in improving the transparency and accountability o f central
government functions (including the re-establishment o f normal budget processes), and
improvements in security, gains in state capacity to actually deliver critical services have
been smaller. Greater focus i s also placed on enhancing the visibility o f results, in particular
through support for monitoring and evaluation.
133. The main outcome being pursued under the institutional strengthening theme is a
strengthening o f the effectiveness, transparency and accountability o f public sector
institutions. This involves activities to (i)
consolidate economic governance reforms, to
strengthen core institutions; and (ii)strengthen key sector ministries that are critical for
service delivery (e.g. education, agriculture, public works, etc). On the results side, further
activities seek to (i)
actually deliver jobs and services; and (ii)
strengthen M&E.
134. In addition to following Government priorities, WBG support in these areas builds o n
- and has been determined by: (i)the strong progress achieved, and firm analytical basis
established, by Bank support for economic governance reform in Haiti since 2004; (ii)
the
leadership role that the Bank has played among donors in this area; (iii)the WBG’s
comparative advantage in governance and institutional strengthening, particularly in fragile
situations; (iv) earlier support for DSNCRP preparation; and (v) the need to support strong
implementation performance and M&E o f Bank-supported projects in different sectors.
135. Consolidating Economic Governance Reforms: Support for strengthening the
transparency and accountability o f core public sector management institutions including
public enterprises through economic governance reforms will be sustained. Building o n
progress achieved, and the analytical base provided by the PEMFAR, the focus i s on the
implementation o f reforms to strengthen budget formulation through the development o f
sector strategies and the introduction o f a medium term perspective in: (i)budget
formulation, (ii)
strengthening budget execution through the development o f the investment
and accounting modules o f SYSDEP, and (iii)
the budget management information system.
Procurement would be strengthened through implementation o f the proposed new
Procurement Law. Internal and external controls will also be strengthened by the
implementation o f the capacity building action plan for CSCCA and the deployment o f
financial comptrollers to all line ministries and institutions.
29

136. The Government and key development partners (EU, IDB, World Bank and IMF),
have formed a budget support group, which has recently signed a Memorandum o f
Understanding that commits them to developing a single matrix o f public financial
management reforms behind which future conditionality will be aligned. The draft matrix
draws from the PEMFAR action plan among other sources. The reform matrix includes
actions to strengthen the public financial management system, procurement, monitoring o f
public enterprises, revenue mobilization, anti-corruption, and the financial sector. The Bank
will aim to align a proposed FYlO budget support operation (around US$14 million) with the
program outlined in the Government’s reform matrix.
137. Strengthening Service Delivery in Key Sectors: Support will focus o n systematically
mainstreaming institutional strengthening and accountability issues across the portfolio to
exploit synergies with service delivery and demand-side initiatives. To improve service
delivery, Bank Group support will aim at identifying and removing specific operational
bottlenecks along the service delivery chain (e.g. financial management, procurement,
communications, staff mobilization) in key sectors. I t will also seek to strengthen the
technical and policy coordination capacity in key ministries (Planning, Finance, Agriculture
and Education).
138. Support for stronger service delivery will also be mainstreamed across the portfolio.
Most investment projects include institutional and capacity strengthening activities, including
the EFA, Water and Sanitation, Electricity Loss Reduction projects, as w e l l as the planned
agricultural project, which has a main focus o n institutional strengthening. Further Bank
activities to support capacity building linked to project implementation include an IDF grant
to strengthen government training capacity for project implementation.
139. In this context, both economic governance reform and stronger service delivery, the
ongoing EGTAG I1 operation and a follow-on Technical Assistance operation planned for
FYlO will focus technical assistance on strengthening the main institutions in the public
sector and key sector ministries (education, health, agriculture, and public works) to improve
service delivery. Efforts will be made to mobilize further trust fund grants for this purpose,
particularly from the SPF and the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). NLTA will build
on the PEMFAR, and would aim to respond in a flexible, responsive manner, with policy
notes on selected strategic issues (e.g. pay policy, civil service structure, investment budget),
and on implementation support to strengthen the capacity o f key line ministries or workshops
for Government officials. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability update i s
proposed for FY12.
140. Delivering Jobs and Services: In recognition o f Haiti’s continuing fragility, emphasis
continues to be placed on direct delivery o f jobs and services through WBG-supported
activities not directly implemented by public institutions. The C D D project will continue to
be a mainstay for responding to community needs in this respect. SPF funding may be
sought for a rapid j o b creation project in FY10. Other projects, including the ERDMP, will
continue to employ labor-intensive projects where appropriate. IFC will pursue investments
with a focus on j o b creation.
141. Strengthening Government M&E and communications capacity: In addition to
assistance provided at the sectoral level (particularly in education), the Bank i s seeking trust
fund support to strengthen central M&E capacity, linked to DSNCRP implementation. An
30

ongoing LICUS grant provides support for enhancing Government communications capacity.
The project aims to enhance transparency and government credibility through better
dissemination of information and stronger dialogue with civil society and other stakeholders
on government activities, results, and resource use.

142. Governance and Anti-Corruption: The World Bank Institute (WBI) will continue to
focus on these areas in close collaboration with other donors. Planned initiatives include
support for strengthening the role of anti-corruption institutions (and the coordination among
them), strengthening the key budget and economic committees of parliament, and improving
the capacity of demand-side institutions such as the news media and civil society.
143. Political Economy: During the CAS period, the Bank is planning to undertake a
political economy diagnostic study which will focus on understanding the political incentives
and mechanisms, and on identifYing win-win strategies by aligning politicians' incentives to
'
improved performance of public sector.

F.

CAS CONSULTATIONS

144. The proposed program was refined in joint Bank-IFC CAS Consultations held in
Port-au-Prince, February 10-13, 2009. IFC organized a series of meetings to discuss private
sector issues and opportunities. Participants included key representatives of the private
sector. In addition, the World Bank and IFC jointly organized four working sessions with·
representatives of:

•

Donors and other international partners, including Brazil, CIDA, the EU, France, the
IDB, Spain, the UN (WFP, UNDP, UNICEF), and the US Agency for International
Development (USAID).

•

The Government of Haiti, including the Prime Minister, the Minister of Economy and
Finance, the Minister of Planning and External Cooperation, the Minister of Trade and
other senior officials.

•

Legislators. This session included the Chairmen of the Senate Economic Affairs and
Education Commissions and a Senate economic expert.

•

Civil society, including international NGOs, local civil society organizations and project
implementation agencies.

145. In addition to these formal consultations, the program reflects ongoing dialogue with
the Government and other donors and the national and sectoral levels, as well as specific
consultations on IDA Conditionality Consultations and the PEMFAR in 2007, the June 2008
CPPR, and several smaller workshops on portfolio and sectoral issues. A client survey in
2009 will provide further opportunity for comprehensive feedback on World Bank activities.

G.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

146. The CAS has drawn from a range of analytical sources, including the DSNCRP and
the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN). The growth pillar analysis has been informed by the
CEM and more recently the strategy documents prepared by the Government for the April
2009 donor conference. The agriCUlture strategy sector note, analytical work on the telecoms
and electricity sector, and the FSAP and ROSC underpin the design and rationale for Bank

31

Group strategy in the sectors they cover. For the human development pillar, the key analyses
include the EFA strategy and the social protection background note. The institutional
strengthening cross-cutting theme draws from the PEMFAR, jointly prepared by the
Government, the World Bank and the IDB, and the follow-on action plan, as well as the
CEM. I t also draws on the governance and anti-corruption survey completed by the
Government, with WBI support, in FY07.

VI.

DONOR ASSISTANCE

147. The bulk o f the external assistance pledged since 2004 has come from five donors:
the United States, Canada, the European Union (EU), the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), and the World Bank. Providing roughly a tenth o f this amount, the Bank has been the
smallest o f these five main donors, and is set to slip to sixth place, with the recent emergence
o f Venezuela as a major donor. W h i l e aggregate figures on Venezuelan aid are not available,
President Chavez has made major multi-year commitments since 2007, which appear to put it
among the country’s top three donors. Haiti’s inclusion (effective March 2008) in
Venezuela’s PetroCaribe program could generate hundreds o f millions o f dollars for the
Haitian Treasury in the next few years, though many o f the funds freed n o w will be
eventually repayable. PetroCaribe funding enabled the Haitian Government to quickly
disburse US$200 million to respond to the humanitariancrisis following the 2008 storms.
148. At the April 2009 conference, donors pledged US$324 million in new funds behind
the Government’s priority program, in addition to the US$2.0-3.0 billion already committed
to Haiti since 2004 (primarily behind the DSNCRP), some o f which has been reallocated
behind the priority program. Funding by main traditional main donors, aligned with the
DSNCRP, is presented in Table 4. The estimates are the latest comparative data available
from the M P C E on disbursement projections (rather than pledges) and do not include the new
US$324 million.

149. W h i l e most donors intervene in a wide range o f sectors linked to the DNSCRP, the
Government has encouraged each to focus o n a few priority areas. The United States and
Canada have put a strong emphasis on health and education. The IDB has been the main
donor for agriculture (followed by the European Union) as well as for water and sanitation.
The IDB and the European Union have been dominant in support for infrastructure
development. IDA is among the largest donors for education and economic governance
reform.
150. Aid coordination is led by the Ministry o f Planning and External Cooperation
(MPCE). In addition, the Resident Coordinator o f the United Nations System plays a key role
in organizing donors at the local level. Overall coordination in Port-au-Prince centers around
weekly meetings o f a group o f larger donors without the Government, and periodic meetings
with the Planning Minister and Prime Minister. Sectoral dialogue is focused around sectoral
tables, a system dating from the ICF. At the regional level, departmental tables have since
2006 facilitated coherence and synergies among interventions in particular zones.
International meetings have been held to date o n an ad hoc basis, with the World Bank
playing an active role in supporting these, including hosting the 2004 donor conference and
several smaller technical meetings, most recently in March 2007.
151. At the April 2009 donor conference, measures to enhance cooperation and
coordination were agreed. The proposals, which still need to be fully fleshed out by the
Government and i t s partners, included: (i)
a revised framework for mutual accountability; (ii)
a strengthening o f key sectoral tables; and (iii)
the creation o f a “policy forum”, as a space
for discussion among the Government and i t s partners on policy priorities, with annual
senior-level meetings.
152. Harmonization i s advancing, but slowly. Donors often cooperate closely on
analytical work, the fomation o f strategies and at the project level, including the use o f
shared project implementation units, parallel and co-financing. Examples o f such close
collaboration include the parallel IDA- IDB Rural Water and Sanitation and Electricity
projects, and the construction o f Route Nationale 3 by the EU, the French Development
Agency and IDA, with closely coordinated implementing arrangements and specifications.
The Government and donors have recently agreed to work toward the establishment o f Sector
Wide Approaches (SWAPS) and programmatic funding in some key sectors. There are few
formal structures in place for joint fimding and implementation.
153. The 2008 Paris Declaration Monitoring Survey noted significant advances in many
areas, but acceleration will be needed to meet the 2010 targets. Donors were increasingly
basing activities on the Government’s DNSCRP and sectoral strategies. Regular dialogue
among the Government and development partners has facilitated exchange o f information o n
planned or ongoing activities. Survey results showed efforts underway to build the capacity
o f central and local government, as well as civil society. However, progress o n aid flow
predictability, mutual accountability and use o f country system appears to be limited.

VII.

RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION

154. A dual strategy will be adopted to monitor results under this CAS. Country level
systems for monitoring poverty, economic and human development are extremely weak and
need to be developed. The Bank will support the Government in improving the monitoring

33

and evaluation o f policies and programs in the MPCE, the MEF, and the sector ministries
involved in the DSNCRP through the strengthening o f the coordination o f the D S N C W
M&E system and the capacity o f Government institutions to improve the quality o f data
collection, analysis and reporting. SPF funding i s being sought for this purpose. Additional
resources may also be sought from the Bank’s STATCAP financing program for statistical
capacity building. The Bank aims to coordinate fbnding with other donors providing
assistance in this area, notably the European Commission.
155. In addition, the Bank will also provide TA through sectoral monitoring systems
established in the context o f Bank and other donor projects, for example in the education
sector. The CAS results framework has ensured that the targets for intermediate outcomes
can be monitored based o n existing systems or those that will be in place in the near future.
156. The Results Framework for monitoring the CAS, grounded in the DSNCRP
objectives and indicators, i s presented as Annex B1.

VIII. MANAGING R I S K S
157. The strategy presented here will be carried out in an environment o f high risks. At the
same time, given the progress made by the country since 2004, promising early results from
the Bank’s portfolio and the commitment o f authorities to advancing with reform, the
potential rewards for implementing this strategy are great. Mitigation measures reflect
lessons from the Bank Group’s experience in fragile states worldwide, as well as the
institution’s earlier experience in Haiti (see B o x 2).

158. If the policy or security environments deteriorate, governance weakens or broad or
sector-specific program implementation issues materialize, the WBG would conduct a
careful review o f ongoing and planned operations and activities and consult with
international partners before deciding how to proceed. I t would inform the Board
accordingly. This corresponds to normal WBG practice in fragile or uncertain situations.
The WBG response would be commensurate with the risks that materialize.
159. The Group would seek to stay engaged in sectors or areas where implementation i s
considered satisfactory. Should implementation o f the Government’s macroeconomic or
economic governance reform policies worsen significantly, the Bank would remain engaged
through investment lending operations but would consider delaying future budget support
until such weaknesses have been addressed. If other risks materialize, such as in the areas o f
security and corruption, the WBG may, as appropriate, scale down the implementation
activities o f investment projects, consider applying legal remedies if needed, restructure such
operations or include further ring-fencing mechanisms to continue targeted support for
service delivery.
160. M a i n risks for Bank engagement, as well as mitigating measures or factors are
outlined below.
161. Haiti remains vulnerable to the political and social instability that has historically
undermined development and the implementation of donor programs in the country. Violent
protests and the fall o f Prime Minister Alexis in April 2008 illustrate the continuing fragility
o f the situation. Difficult socio-economic conditions and multiple elections increase the risk
o f instability in the CAS period. The presence o f M I N U S T A H and the strong commitment

34

o f the international community, including the Bank Group, to supporting the Government
and i t s reform program are stabilizing factors. Over the longer term, the Bank’s focus on
building the legitimacy o f the state, including through stronger state service delivery.

162. Financial crisis and economic downturn in major international economies could have
a serious negative impact on Haiti, through reduced remittances, donor funding and
investment. There i s evidence o f an impact in these areas already, which could jeopardize
macroeconomic stability, poverty reduction, human development and private sector
development in Haiti. Support from the Bank and other donors will be a mitigating factor for
Haiti in these areas, but a serious crisis would also reduce the overall effectiveness o f that
assistance.
163. The country is extremely susceptible to external shocks. Extreme poverty and a
dependence on imported food and fuel have exacerbated the effects o f high international
commodity prices on Haiti. Lower world commodity prices have eased the pressure o n the
country since late 2008. Strengthening food security, including through raising agricultural
output, has become a strategic priority for the Government and donors.
164. Haiti is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including hurricanes andgash floods.
The Bank’s and Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project, Emergency Bridge
Reconstruction and Vulnerability Reduction Project, the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project
and the Emergency School Reconstruction Project directly address this. In addition, the Bank
plans to retain flexibility in the CAS period to respond to any future natural disasters by
reallocating funds from pipeline or existing projects or other sources, including trust funds.
165. The overall fiduciary environment remains highly risky. Despite improvements such
as those outlined above, Haiti’s financial management and procurement systems continue to
show significant shortcomings, while institutional capacity is weak and corruption prevalent.
The Bank will continue to support institutional reform in these areas. At the project level,
funding will continue to be ring-fenced and FM and procurement rules strictly applied,
together with the provision o f assistance to strengthen the capacity o f local project teams in
this area.
166.
Weak institutional capacity could impede successful project implementation and the
absorption of donor funds overall. Implementation progress is generally satisfactory, despite
the challenging, low-capacity context. Bank operations are generally small, simple and welldefined. The Bank maintains active support and supervision for projects in Haiti, including
cross-portfolio efforts to strengthen capacity and coordination. This i s facilitated by the
ongoing expansion o f Country Office staffing. At the country level, aid absorption is
increased by widespread use o f NGOs and other non-public actors for service provision.
167. Political opposition could impede reform and implementation progress. With
frequent elections and recently strained legislative-executive relations, there i s a risk that
reforms and interventions supported by the Bank Group would be held up by legislative
opposition or inactivity. This will be o f particular concern if Haiti returns to receiving partcredit IDA allocations, which is expected after the full delivery o f H P C and MDRI
assistance. Credit-backed projects require parliamentary approval in Haiti, which is not
needed for grants. To mitigate this risk, the Bank Group has recently increased efforts

35

outreach activities for parliamentarians, to build relationships, gain feedback and share
information. This has included a CAS consultation session for parliamentarians.
168. Diminishing I D A allocations, particularly from F Y I 1 onwards, could limit the ability
of the Bank to play an influential role among donors. Mitigating factors include the strong
planned program o f analytical work, which will continue to give the Bank an intellectual
leadership role. In addition, the Bank will actively pursue trust fund resources to compensate
for reducing IDA funds, as well as leveraging funds from other sources and collaborating
closely with other donors on joint projects.

SUMMARY

OF PDNA

169. Following the 2008 storms and hurricanes, the Government led a Post-Disaster
Needs Assessment (PDNA) with technical and financial support from the Global Facility
for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the United Nations, the European
Commission and the World Bank. The PDNA provides a comprehensive recovery plan
focusing o n social protection, food security and watershed recovery. I t also lays out an
action plan for strengthening the National Disaster Risk Management System, including
the mainstreaming o f vulnerability reduction and risk management into national and
sectoral development strategies and investment programs.
170. The PDNA put damages and losses due to the hurricanes at close to US$900
million or 15 percent o f Haiti's 2007 GDP - which i s more than 45 percent of the revised
2008 budget. The table below provides the details. Productive sectors and infrastructure
account for two-thirds o f total damages and losses.

ANNEX F: PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES BY SECTORS

i.

Agriculture and Rural Development

171. Increasing Haiti’s agricultural production i s a central element o f the
Government’s response to the food crisis as well as the economic growth agenda. The
agriculture sector contributes 27 percent o f GDP (2007), employs approximately 50
percent o f the total workforce, 2/3 o f the rural workforce, and 75 percent o f the lowincome workforce. The last couple o f years have brought modest increases in public
investments with respect to rural infrastructure and agricultural services-rural roads,
rehabilitation and improvement o f irrigation systems, re-launching o f regional
agricultural research and development centers, and animal plant and health services-as
w e l l as some success in agroforestry. Recent experience suggests that farmers’ incomes
can increase in a sustained fashion while environmental degradation and vulnerability to
natural disasters are reduced. Efforts to scale up adoption o f such agricultural
technologies among farmers, especially in hillsides, however, have been largely
ineffective.
172. Avian Flu. The H5H2 virus was detected in December, 2007, in the Dominican
Republic, which shares the same island as Haiti. In June, 2008, the existence o f the virus
was confirmed in Haiti. There are approximately 5 million poultry in Haiti, o f which 80
percent are owned by subsistence farmers for family consumption and sale o n local
markets. The Ministry o f Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development’s
(MARNDR) Directorate o f Animal Health that includes the National Veterinary
Laboratory at Tamarinier, has limited prevention, surveillance and response capacity due
to the dearth o f facilities. I t also suffers from a shortage o f veterinarians.

ii.

Infrastructure

173. Transport. Despite massive investments, particularly in roads, over the past five
years, transport remains a formidable bottleneck to growth and poverty reduction. Most
o f the road network i s s t i l l in poor or very poor condition, impeding access during the
rainy season and causing transport costs and travel times to be more than double regional
norms. Road investments should continue to focus on the primary network as well as
secondary and tertiary roads that are considered key to territorial development by
regional and local stakeholders. Timely road maintenance i s an urgent priority and
requires a major scaling up o f the routine, periodic and emergency maintenance activities
successfblly piloted through the Road Maintenance Fund over the past two years. The
institutional capacity o f the Ministry o f Public Works, Transport, and Communications
(MTPTC) i s extremely weak and needs to be progressively rebuilt within a strategic
restructuring o f the ministry and in the broader context o f public sector reform in Haiti.
174. Private sector participation may increase in airports in the near future, following
an ambitious reform program o f the Government, which should produce significant

52

efficiency gains. The port sector, however, remains in critical condition and, given the
country's geographic configuration, poses serious limitations to competitiveness.
175. Electricity. The Haitian electricity sector faces a number o f significant challenges,
reflected by the lowest rate o f access to electricity in the region (12.5 percent) and
unreliable service (4 to 8 hours per day in the capital o n average). The sector suffers from
limited public resources, political interference in procurement decision processes, a lack
o f transparency and accountability, and the inefficiency o f the public electricity utility
ElectricitC d'HaTti (EDH). The most pressing needs in the sector are: (i)
improving sector
enhancing and rehabilitating existing
governance, including EDH management; and (ii)
infrastructure.
176. Haiti also faces a domestic energy crisis. Wood fuel supplies 72 percent o f
household energy demand. Due to indiscriminate exploitation o f firewood, and
unfavorable environmental conditions, forest cover today represents a mere 1.4 percent o f
the national territory.

iii.Human Development
177. The near-total absence o f functioning public health and education systems has l e f t
Haiti with some o f the lowest indicators on human development across the globe. With
nearly h a l f o f the population illiterate, and characterized by an infant mortality rate o f 76
per 1,000 births and the highest incidence o f H N / A I D S outside sub-Saharan Afr-ica.
178. Malnutrition i s a serious concern in Haiti with an estimate o f one out o f four
children (under five years) chronically malnourished and one third o f them suffering from
severe malnutrition. More recently, the worldwide economic downturn and the
accompanying food and fuel price shocks have hrther aggravated the plight o f the poor.
The fear i s that the impact o f the current crises o n caloric consumption and therefore o n
malnutrition will badly hit the most vulnerable groups- children aged 0-2 years, and
pregnant and nursing mother^'^.
179. Education: Haiti faces considerable challenges in the education sector: (i)
extremely weak public provision o f schooling, representing less than 20 percent o f
enrollment and less than 10 percent o f primary schools; (ii)
very poor quality o f services
l o w state capacity to respond to these and other issues in the
(when available); and (iii)
sector. Minimal state provision and fbnding o f education results in school fees that
average more than US$8Ol6per child, and a primary net enrollment rate (NER) o f a mere
71 percent (and as l o w as 55 percent, according to some e~timates).'~Children who do
have access to school often repeat grades and drop out prior to finishing primary
education, many without acquiring even minimal literacy skills, due to the poor quality o f

representative survey o n nutrition. The results should be ready in the next months.

Moisset 2005. UNICEF 2006 estimates US$131, including indirect costs such as books, u n i f o ' m and
transportation.

the latest DHS survey to more than 80 percent according to official statistics.

teaching. A poverty trap is then developed, as those dropouts have few opportunities for
human capital accumulation, resulting in poor labor market outcomes. Their children are
then born into poverty, with the corresponding l o w access to quality education, which
limits their prospects for attaining decent educational and thus labor market outcomes.
Finally, the state’s capacity for increasing the supply o f education and improving the
quality o f teaching i s very low.
180. Health. Services reach only 40 to 60 percent o f the population. I t i s estimated that
about 80 percent o f the population rely on traditional medicine, while 40 percent do not
seek health care in the formal health network due to financial barriers. The poor have
limited access to basic treatment (for malaria, fever, and diarrhea) because o f their
inability to pay for the treatment or to buy drugs. They rely on public institutions for their
care where they can apply for and obtain fee waivers. However, only about 30 percent o f
health care facilities in Haiti are public and most o f them are located in urban areas. The
private for-profit sector, which provides about 20 percent service coverage, is mainly
located in urban areas and is prohibitively expensive for the majority o f Haitians.
18 1. Water and Sanitation. Access to safe water and sanitation services i s poor: only
54 percent o f the population has access to an improved source o f water, and 30 percent to
adequate sanitation facilities. A s a result, diarrheal diseases claim the lives o f nearly
5,000 children every year (WHO 2008). Available b d s cover only a fraction o f the
investment needed to reach the MDG target for water supply and sanitation. The two
main sector institutions are weak. In January 2009, Parliament passed a water and
sanitation framework law that assigns the lead role in the sector to the MTPTC, and aims
to gradually decentralize service provision to four regional entities and ultimately to
municipalities.
182. Human development outcomes are also adversely affected by the extremely
limited public social protection services. The ‘safety net’ in Haiti is comprised largely o f
remittances and humanitarian relief, but these only partially fill the gaping void left by
the state. Left on their own, many households resort to negative coping strategies, such
as pulling children out o f school, and selling o f f productive assets (tools, livestock) in
order to survive. The current food price crisis has highlighted yet again the importance o f
having an effective social protection system in place with the ability to target the most
vulnerable and to respond when needs arises. There i s perhaps more awareness today
than ever before o f the need to develop a coherent and effective social protection system
that corresponds to Haiti’s level o f development and the nature o f the shocks it faces.
iv. Environment and Disaster Risk Management
183. Environment: Haiti’s environmental degradation i s a major factor in i t s
vulnerability to natural disasters. Over the past two decades, water catchment areas in
upper watersheds have been rapidly deforested, with forests converted to agricultural and
livestock use, or felled for charcoal production, without replanting. This has destabilized
hillsides and reduced the filtration capacity o f water, leading to extensive erosion and
flooding. The DSNCRP estimates that 25 o f the country’s 30 main watersheds are
severely degraded. There is an urgent need to improve environmental management, by

54

cutting charcoal production and improving agricultural and environmental conservation.
Developing and implementing integrated watershed management strategies i s a priority.
184. Disaster Risk Management. According to the World Bank’s Natural Disaster
Hotspot Study, Haiti is one o f the most at-risk countries in the world to adverse natural
events. With 96 percent o f i t s population living at risk from one or more hazards, Haiti
has the highest vulnerability rating among the region’s small developing island states
(12.9 on a scale o f 13).’* Severe environmental degradation and the presence o f
settlements in l o w lying areas and floodplains make the country vulnerable.
Vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the high levels o f poverty, weak public infrastructure,
a history o f ineffective governments as well as serious fiscal problems.
185. Over the past four years, Haiti’s National Disaster Risk Management System
(NDRMS) has successfully reduced the mortality levels associated with adverse natural
events.” While much has been accomplished in the areas o f disaster preparation and
response, the next challenge for Haiti will be to secure i t s hard w o n development gains.
This issue i s particularly acute in Haiti, as over the course o f the last 20 years, adverse
natural events such as the impact o f the 2008 hurricane season have reduced Haiti’s
annual growth by an average o f 1.5 percent per year. From the 2008 storms, damages
and losses were put at nearly US$900 million, or 15 percent o f GDP (PDNA).
186. While the N D R M S provides the general directives for vulnerability reduction and
risk management, i t s operational focus remains oriented towards disaster preparation and
response activities. In order to successfully transit from a “living at r i s k ” to “living with
risk” country, Haiti needs to integrate vulnerability reduction and risk management into
i t s national and sectoral development strategies and programs.
v. The Business Environment and Framework for Private Sector Activity

187. In addition to the more general problems o f insufficient infrastructure, political
instability and physical security, the challenges facing investors and businesses include:
weak regulatory frameworks and institutional capacit an inadequate system o f land
titling; and insufficient risk capital. Haiti ranked 154ti? out o f 181 countries for overall
ease o f doing business in the 2009 Doing Business rankings.
188. The private sector, like the public sector, faces a shortage o f skilled labor,
exacerbated by the massive outward migration that affects the country. However,
remittances and investments from Haitians abroad also open opportunities for the private
sector (See B o x 5).
189. The HOPE IAct, passed by the U S Congress in December 2006, extended dutyfree treatment for selected apparel exports from Haiti to the US. Although it was
originally conceived to rejuvenate the garment sector, Haiti’s ability to take advantage o f
HOPE was limited by: the relatively short timeframe o f the legislation (three years);
Reducing Disaster Risk, a Challengefor Development, UNDP 2004.
While the 2004 hurricane season resulted in 5,000 casualties over 300,000 affected people, in the storms
o f 2008 resulted in fewer than 800 casualties among 865,000 affected people.
l9

55

restrictions o n fabric rules o f origin; and limitations on the types o f garments that were
given preferential access.
190. The HOPE I1 Act, which passed in M a y 2008, greatly improves treatment o f
Haitian products - and i s therefore a more promising opportunity for revitalizing the
garment industry, previously one o f Haiti's largest. HOPE I1has an effective period o f
10 years, with relaxed rules o f origin, and extends preferential trade benefits to both
woven and knitted-products made in Haiti and imported into the US. A s such, it covers
most o f Haiti's existing and fbture apparel exports. However, HOPE I1 requires
companies involved to pass stringent labor guidelines, many o f them within 16 months o f
the legislation being passed. Implementation o f these labor standards i s critical to the
success o f Haiti's ability to capitalize on the preferential access that Haiti provides.
191, In addition to the difficult business environment, as outlined above, Haitian textile
producers are constrained by a range o f industry-specific factors, including a lack o f
Ready-Made Garment (RMG) specific infrastructure, including factory space to house
production operations; as well as poor access to finance due to a lack o f risk capital. The
country also lacks the knowledge and skills in labor management needed for the
implementation o f the labor rules required o f companies wishing to obtain duty-free entry
into the U S market under HOPE 11.
Box 5: Outward Migration and Remittances
Massive outward migration has deprived the country o f many skilled and educated people but remittances
from the diaspora sustain the country. In 2006, the roughly 1.5 million Haitians living abroad sent back
more than US$1.65 billion (IDB data), or around a third o f GDP, making Haiti one o f the most remittancedependent economies in the world.

The Bank's "Remittances and Development" contains estimates o f the development impacts o f these flows
o n Haiti. Using 2001 data it finds that remittances tend to reduce income inequality and poverty. Moderate
poverty rates among recipients are around 11 percentage points lower (15 points for extreme poverty)
thanks to remittances. With regard to labor supply, Haitians who receive remittances are more likely (not
less as in other L A C countries) to participate in the labor force than non-recipient individuals with similar
characteristics. They are also more likely to be self-employed in the commerce sector, most likely
operating informal microbusinesses (see below).

As well as benefits, remittances also create policy challenges. Some o f these include: dealing with the brain
drain (more than 80 percent o f Haitian university graduates have migrated and about half o f them are not
employed in activities that are consistent with their skills), dealing with pressure toward real exchange rate
appreciations (e.g. by further increasing market flexibility and potentially moving from payroll to VA
taxes), and reducing transaction costs for remittances services through increased competition, contestability
and transparency in this industry (see the recent FSAP and an ongoing "Corridor study" for some more
specific suggestions).
One specific challenge i s taking advantage o f remittances to promote increases in access to financial
services among the poor. By depositing a fraction o f remittances in financial institutions, recipients could
gain access to a greater range o f financial services and find a safe way to accumulate assets. T o a large
extent, however, this depends o n the ability o f banks and especially microfinance institutions (MFIs) to
develop appropriate financial products, targeted specifically to l o w income recipients. As suggested by the
recent FSAP, t h i s i s already happening to some extent in Haiti, with most MFIs offering some sort o f
savings product to their clients, 90 percent o f whom are informal commercial m i c r o f m owners.
Reportedly (based o n interviews with MFIs), most o f the new saving deposits captured by MFIs come from
remittances recipients.

56

ANNEXG: SELECTED RESULTS DURING I S N PERIOD
192. The WBG’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board in January 2007,
focused o n two pillars: (i)
delivering hope to the population through quick wins in the
areas o f basic services and j o b creation; (ii)
restoring credibility in public institutions
through reforms that promote longer-term economic governance and institutional
development.
193. I S N performance was satisfactory. All o f the specific results aimed for, as set out
in the table below. The targets set were modest, as most IDA projects would be at an
early stage at the end o f the I S N period. But solid results had already been achieved by
the end o f FY08, in particular through more advanced IDA projects (FY05 and FY06
approvals) and trust fund grants. In addition, the rapid expansion o f the portfolio in
FY07-FY08 has laid a solid foundation for results to be generated in the current C A S
period, with most projects now in the implementation phase.

i.

ISN Pillar 1: Delivering Quick Wins in Basic Services and Job Creation

194. The C D D project has been an efficient channel to deliver basic services and
income generation opportunities quickly to poor Haitians. By June 2008, the C D D project
had formed and trained 32 community committees (COPRODEPs) and 2,460
community-based organizations (CBOs). A total o f 164 sub-projects had been completed
or were under implementation. (By December 2008, the total had risen to 612). These
focused on: farming and livestock assets, equipment or inputs (27 percent); rehabilitation
o f roads (20 percent); access to water for personal consumption and irrigation (15
percent); community-based MSMEs (10 percent); and youth-targeted sub-projects, for
professional skills or recreation (8 percent). A US$1.25 million PCF project piloted
C D D in the violence-prone urban areas o f CitC Solei1 and B e l Air. By June 2008, two
COPRODEPs had been created, 135 CBOs trained and 19 sub-projects completed. (As o f
March 2009,27 sub-projects had been completed and 10 were under implementation).
195. The strengthening o f Haiti’s disaster management system, due largely to IDA
support, was evident in the reduced death toll in the port city o f Gonaives after the 2008
storms, compared to the impact o f Tropical Storm Jeanne in 2004. While flooding and
damage were worse in 2008, the number killed in the city fell to 793 from about 3,000 in
2004. By the end o f the I S N period, the ERDMP project had supported the creation o f 54
local civil protection committees, the formulation o f preparedness plans, the training and
equipping o f rapid response teams, the introduction o f an early warning system, and
shelter improvement. By June 2008, 26 small risk mitigation projects o f about
US$25,000 had been completed (54 by December). Reconstruction works and risk
mitigation projects contributed to the creation o f temporary jobs in target areas.
196. To reduce the cost o f cooking for urban households, improve health conditions
and reduce pressure on wood fuel resources (through lower charcoal consumption), the
ESMAP-funded project, “Dissemination o f improved stoves in Haiti” (US$390,000), has
assisted MSMEs in developing production o f energy efficient stoves. A s o f December
2008, more than 2,000 improved stoves had been sold, 144 artisans trained and 120
certified for the production o f stoves. Additional ESMAP funding o f US$80,000 enabled
the extension o f the project through June 2009.
197. Bank support enabled an expansion o f access to basic education for poor children,
and improved readiness to attend school and learn among children (through the provision
o f nutritious meals). Tuition waivers under the EFA project enabled 29,000 poor
children aged 5-12 in the Nippes and Artibonite regions to attend school in the 07-08
school year. This was nearly double the target o f 15,000, due partly to additional funding
from CIDA. A school feeding program through a PCF grant, and subsequently the EFA
project, provided nutritious food to 15,000 .poor children in 06-07, and 30,000 in 07-08.
198. The LICUS-financed Water and Sanitation Project (WSS, US$855,000) built
three water supply systems in small towns, supplying clean water to more than 5,200
people in the Southern Department and promoting an innovative management model
aiming at greater sustainability, through cooperation between local committees and
professional operators. Constructions also created temporary jobs.

58

ii.

I S N Pillar 2: Restoring Credibility in Public Institutions

199. The Bank’s program supported the improvement o f budget planning, control and
execution and the strengthening o f the public procurement system. The EGRO I1
program supported Government achievements during the I S N period including: the
satisfactory execution o f the FY2007 and 2008 annual appropriation laws with an
emphasis on poverty reduction, the audits o f the treasury accounts for FY2003, 2004 and
2005 and the drafting o f the Budget Review Acts for FY2005 and 2006. With Bank
support, mainly through EGTAG I,a partial adoption o f improved procurement practices
by some key government entities has occurred. The National Commission for Public
Procurement (CNMP), created in 2005, has drafted a new Procurement Law and
introduced standard bidding documents and national procedures to Government
procurement staff through a series o f seminars in 2006 and 2007. Public financial
management was also improved by: (i)
the development o f a budget preparation and
execution manual; (ii)
the recruitment and training o f public accountants and financial
technical assistance to CSCCA to clear the backlogs o f audits: and (iv)
comptrollers; (iii)
the financing o f a debt management system (also EGTAG I).In addition, the
introduction o f a monitoring mechanism for transfers to the electricity sector has helped
to improve transparency in the sector.
200. With the aim o f strengthening the public sector’s human resource management
and promoting public employee accountability, the Bank Group helped authorities
achieve some important milestones: the completion o f a draft o f the registry for state
employees o f key line ministries (EGTAG I),
the completion o f a National Governance
Diagnostic Survey and dissemination o f results (WBI Trust Fund and EGTAG), the
drafting o f an Anti-Corruption Strategy (adopted 2009), technical assistance for the
preparation o f a law on asset declaration which has been in effect since February 2008
and the support o f the Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC), created in 2005 and now fully
operational (US$1 million LICUS grant and EGTAG).
201. Bank-financed projects also contributed to a strengthening o f the institutional and
strategic frameworks o f key sectors, including education and water and sanitation. A
US$500,000 LICUS project for “Public-Private Partnerships for Education” which laid
the creation o f the National Office
the foundations for the EFA project, contributed to: (i)
for Education Partnership (ONAPE), to oversee public-private partnership; and (ii)the
preparation o f a national Education for All strategy. In the water and sanitation sector,
the LICUS WSS Project enhanced the capacity and credibility o f SNEP (Sewice National
d’Eau Potable), the State Water utility, as an execution agency. SNEP’s policy role was
also strengthened through the creation o f a rural unit (cellule rurale) and the development
o f operational directives that serve as a basis for i t s cooperation agreements with NGOs.

59

ANNEXI:DETAILED
PROGRAMBY CAS PILLARS
A. CAS pillar 1 - Promoting Growth and Local Development

i.Community-Drivenand Local Development
202. A second-generation rural C D D project o f US$9 million is envisioned for FY10.
This project would build on the success o f the current C D D efforts and increase support
to local authorities while safeguarding the de-politicized approach. As an input to the
preparation o f this project, various local-level service delivery mechanisms will be
assessed to help harmonize C D D in Haiti and ensure a mainstreamed, coherent,
accountable and effective service delivery framework at the local and community level.
203. In early 2009, an additional financing o f US$8 million was processed to ensure
continued support to the rural communes who participate in the ongoing US$38 million
IDA C D D project which covers 57 rural communes (of 140 in total). The funding was
part o f the Bank's post-hurricane response, as it provided an effective way to deliver
resources to needy rural communities. In late 2008, a US$15.7 million urban C D D
project became effective. This project scales up the C D D approach in poor and violenceprone urban areas, building on the successful US$1.25 million pilot funded by a Post
Conflict Trust Fund Grant which closed on 30 April, 2009.
204. I F C will seek to facilitate private sector investment, particularly in export
generating sectors, developing opportunities under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.
Investments in trade financing and microfinance will also be supporting rural producers,
likely complementing the C D D project and IDA support to small farmers. Furthermore,
I F C advisory services o n improving the business environment should have a positive
impact for the agribusiness sector. IFC projects will build on IDB technical assistance in
investment generation, and will work in conjunction with a USAID PSD project (ITrade).

ii.Infrastructure
205. Transport. An additional grant financing o f around US$lO million for the ongoing
Transport and Territorial Development Project (US$16 million) is proposed for FYlO to
replenish the funds that were reallocated to emergency reconstruction activities in 2007
following the passage o f Tropical Storm Noel, as well as cover the increase in road
works' prices. This project lowers marketing costs for small producers in two pilot microregions by improving road conditions and financing o f productive initiatives prioritized
by local stakeholders as part o f a territorial development planning process. The project i s
implemented in close coordination with the French Development Agency and the
European Union, and includes support on road maintenance policies with the Ministry o f
Public Works, Transport and Communication (MTPTC), as well as technical assistance
to the Haitian Road Maintenance Fund.
206. A new US$20 million Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and Vulnerability
Reduction Project was approved by the Board in November 2008. This grant finances
61

retroactively emergency solutions (fords, temporary overpasses) to quickly restore access
on select main roads, as well as the reconstruction o f two o f the four main bridges that
were destroyed by the 2008 series o f tropical storms and hurricanes. The project will
improve the resilience o f Haitian bridges and roads to future natural disasters. I t will also
finance institutional building and technical assistance activities to help improve
infrastructure asset management practices within the MTPTC, and strengthen the
National Disaster Risk Management System (see Pillar 3 below).
207. A joint venture between MINUSTAH and the Bank, implemented by UNDP, will
use a US$903,000 L I C U S grant to rehabilitate and improve L a n e 23 and associated
drainage systems. Lane 23 is a currently impassable main access road to the center o f
Martissant, an impoverished urban area o f Port-au-Prince, from the Route Nationale No.
2 highway. The project also seeks to improve living and sanitary conditions, create shortterm employment, and promote a reduction in crime and violence by addressing key
socio-economic drivers o f violence and gang membership (poverty and unemployment).
M I N U S T A H i s contributing engineering expertise and equipment.
208. Energy. An additional grant financing o f US$3 million is proposed for mid-year
2009 to finance private management services for the public electricity utility (EDH),
which will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f the utility, as well as meeting cost
overruns for the existing project. This will supplement the Electricity Loss Reduction
project (US$6M), through which the Bank supports improvements in the quality o f the
electricity services by strengthening the financial and operational performance o f EDH
Activities funded by the original project include the implementation o f customer
management and technical service management systems. The additional financing also
builds on a PPIAF study ($590,000) which set out a proposal for improving EDH
management and drafted contracts for the experts to be brought in. The study also
financed tariff and market studies. In parallel, I F C will support private investments in
electricity.
209. Renewable energy is another area where joint Bank/IFC efforts could lead to
private sector investment opportunities. The Bank financed a study o n the potential for
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in Haiti which sought to promote
development o f clean energy projects and reduce future dependency o n fossil fuel-based
generation. Through the CDM, eligible projects could obtain carbon credits to leverage
private sector investment in clean energy. This study could lead to IFC investments in the
sector.
210. Telecommunications. The Government o f Haiti has requested Bank seed funding
to build, with the private sector, a national broadband telecommunications network to
connect rural areas to urban centers, and also to access international submarine networks
and a high speed link with the Dominican Republic. This project would be part o f Haiti's
participation in a Caribbean-wide Regional Communications Infrastructure Program,
aimed at promoting global competitiveness and regional integration in the Caribbean,
through lower costs o f connectivity. Telecommunications i s potentially an area for
Bank/IFC collaboration.

62

2 11. Manufacturing - Textiles. Garment manufacturing may generate employment in
Haiti. The RMG sector needs technical assistance and capacity building aimed at
increasing productivity and attracting short and long-term financing. This sector will be a
key priority IFC’s investments in the country. Given the difficult constraints in this
sector, I F C will seek to develop an integrated approach: (i)investments, largely
advisory services including
contingent on the availability o f viable projects; and (ii)
investment climate reform, agribusiness, improving labor practices, business skills and
company-specific technical assistance.

212. Should the opportunity arise, IFC will invest in other growth and income
generating activities, notably in other manufacturing activities and tourism.
improve access to finance through investments
213. Financid Sector. IFC will help: (i)
in microfinance, general bank lending, trade finance, and special projects to support
strengthen the financial sector by engaging with
priority sectors such as textile; and (ii)
leading financial institutions (including equity investments). Work done under the
Bank/IMF FSAP, is helping open new opportunities for I F C investment. WBG
coordination in this area will help improve banking sector penetration, notably for the
smaller entrepreneurs and the rural producers resulting in income generating
opportunities for poor people.

iii.Agriculture
214. In light o f the high priority assigned to increasing agricultural productivity, a
US$5 million operation is being prepared to strengthen agriculture public services in midyear 2009. The project will address key institutional bottlenecks in the Ministry o f
Agriculture and catalyze the disbursement o f substantial resources available by other
donors in the sector. I t will also pilot improved service delivery approaches to producers
in the east o f the country (Thiotte-Baptiste). The operation i s being processed under the
Global Food Response Program.
B. CAS Pillar 2 - Investing in Human Capital

i.Education and Training
215. The overall Bank strategy in the education sector is to support the effective
implementation o f the Government’s National Strategic Plan for Education for All
(SNNEPT). Specifically, the Bank will focus o n the first two strategic choices relating
to increasing the enrollment o f Haitian children at the primary and pre-primary levels
with the view o f reaching the 2015 goal o f universal primary education. As such,
projects will focus o n restoring or increasing access to schooling through: (i)
reconstructing damaged schools; (ii)
providing tuition waivers for poor families; and (iii)
increasingly the supply o f trained teachers.
216. The first education project in the CAS period i s the US$5 million Emergency
School Reconstruction Project (ESRP), prepared under OP./BP. 8.0 and approved in
March 2008. Inthe wake o f Tropical Storm Fay and Hurricanes, Gustav, Hanna and Ike,

63

and following the tragic collapse o f two schools, the Government requested financial and
technical support from the Bank to help restore educational infrastructure. The project
has two components: (i)
reconstructing 15-20 schools in affected areas, following a
‘building back better’ approach; and (ii)reducing and mitigating the vulnerability o f
educational infrastructure. The project provides support for the development o f a
National Plan o f Action for Safe Schools. As well as helping Haiti build stronger school
structures, this will strengthen the capacity o f the Haitian government to enhance disaster
resilience across the education sector through training, appropriate national guidelines
and other measures.
217. A follow-on project, the second phase o f the adaptable programmatic grant (APG)
program launched with the FY07 Education for All project, is envisaged for FY10. In
addition to continuing the focus o n financing non-public education through the public
sector, it i s expected that APG 2 will move beyond primary education toward Early
Childhood Education (ECE). Elements that will inform the program design are: (i)
the
degree to which current partners continue to co-finance activities implemented under
APG 1 (either directly, or through the establishment o f a Multi-Donor Trust Fund); (ii)
the amount o f financing that Haiti will qualify for under the Education for All Fast-Track
the preliminary activities and pilots to be implemented
Initiative (EFA FTI); and (iii)
over the course o f the year at the E C E level, supported by EPDF funding.
The ongoing Education for All (EFA) project has surpassed targets planned for
218.
FY08, and continues to generate good results in FY09. Due in part to additional funding
provided by CIDA, the number o f children enrolled in the EFA’s tuition waiver program
nearly doubled i t s expected target, from 15,000 to 29,000, and has more than doubled in
FY09, surpassing the floating HIPC trigger o f supporting 50,000 children using a state
mechanism for subsidizing non-public provision o f education services. Similarly, the
school feeding component reached an estimated 45,000 children, 20,000 above the set
target o f 25,000 for FY09. Other components are well underway, as planned: (i)the
design o f an accelerated teacher training program; (ii)an Early Grade Reading
Assessment; and (iii)
various capacity building activities in the Ministry o f Education.
219. The preparation o f a new project in the education sector catalyzed the
development o f the new teacher training program. The US$6 million IDA project
features substantial technical assistance provided by the Bank for the design o f the new
training program. The program is scheduled to begin training new student-teachers in
September o f 2009, in an effort to meet the floating HIPC trigger o f training 2,500 new
teachers through an accelerated teacher training program.
220. Business skills for MSMEs. Most SMEs in IDA countries such as Haiti, have
poor management skills that limit their ability to design and implement sound business
strategies. This has a negative impact on their productivity, efficiency and business
growth. Overall, there i s a lack o f access to professional training providers that properly
address SME training needs. I F C will make use o f i t s Business Edge program to help
build SMEs business skills.

ii.Social Protection and Nutrition
221. Social Protection and nutrition. In response to a Government request to explore
options for strengthening nutritional security among Haitian children, the HD team has
begun a two-year program o f non-lending technical assistance (NLTA) for Haiti. The
objective is to improve the capacity and effectiveness o f nutrition-related programs to
address problems o f severe and chronic malnutrition among those most vulnerable to
permanent damage caused by malnutrition. The NLTA will contribute to this objective
(in partnership with the Government o f Haiti, and donor cornmunitgo) by undertaking
Knowledge and Information;
work, opportunistically, in three thematic areas:
Strengthening Nutritional Security Programs; and Building Constituency and Institutions
for Nutritional Security. The work will build on the Government's interest in learning
from the food prices crisis and building a more resilient social protection system. This
AAA will also inform the design o f APG 2 by looking at the possibility o f using transfers
to poor households to accomplish some o f the same goals as the existing system o f
school-managed tuition subsidies.

iii.Water Supply and Sanitation
222. The Bank supports efforts to improve drinking water and sanitation in rural areas
through a US$5 million IDA grant approved in 2007, and a US$5 million SPF grant
approved in 2009. These are implemented in close partnership with the IDB, which
finances a US$15 million program in five o f Haiti's ten departments. The Bank and the
IDB efforts follow the same set o f operational directives for rural water supply and
sanitation which establish rules for a Sector-wide Approach. Under the new Framework
Law passed in January 2009, a General Directorate for Water and Sanitation i s in the
process o f being established in the Ministry o f Public Works, and four regional water and
sanitation authorities will be set up over the coming years, ultimately replacing the
existing two public water companies.
223. The Bank actively seeks to harmonize approaches between the rural water and
sanitation project, the C D D project and the disaster management project at the level o f
local communities and o f implementing agencies. Expected benefits include the
introduction o f more sustainable management practices into water and sanitation C D D
projects, more transparent and participatory local-level decision-making, and the
integration o f local disaster vulnerability assessment in the designs o f water systems.

C. CAS Pillar 3 - Reducing Vulnerability to Disasters
224. Reducing Vulnerabilities. Bank-financed projects since the 2008 hurricanes
integrate vulnerability reduction and risk management in their development objectives,
notably the Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and Vulnerability Reduction Project, and
The collaboration started with WFP, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Health
Organization (WHO), IDB and U S A I D but other development partners have been identified and will be
approached in the next month to j o i n the collaboration.
2o

65

the Emergency School Reconstruction Project. The Bank will actively also seek to
facilitate Haiti’s access to climate change adaptation funds.

225. Disaster Risk Management. In response to the damage caused by Hurricane Dean
and Tropical Storms Noel and Olga in 2007, IDA approved an additional financing o f
US$7.4 million grant for Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project for a
total o f US$19.4 million. This project supports the rehabilitation of areas affected by
adverse events, strengthens the country’s capacity to manage natural disaster risks and
better respond to emergencies, and reduces the vulnerabilities o f communities through
risk identification and mitigation activities.
226. Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). GFDRR has
identified Haiti as one o f five priority countries in the Latin America and Caribbean
region. I t supported a recent analysis o f disaster risk management policies and activities
and will finance a significant scaling up o f the disaster risk management program in
Haiti. GFDRR will also support the establishment o f a vulnerability reduction and risk
management reduction coordination unit within the M P C E with a US$500,000 grant. The
unit will prepare a national vulnerability reduction and risk management policy, and
coordinate the integration o f risk management into the sectoral development strategies
and investment programs as well as the preparation, implementation and monitoring o f
the national recovery and reconstruction program”
227. Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project. Haiti i s a member o f CCRIF, which reduces
countries’ financial vulnerability to catastrophic events by providing immediate liquidity
after a severe hurricane or earthquake. The CCRlF i s a multi-country reserve fund that
relies on transparent parametric triggers for potential insurance payouts. Haiti’s
participation in the CCRIF was initially supported by an IDA grant o f US$9 million
approved in FY07 which financed the entrance fee, and 100 percent o f the first two
annual insurance premiums. The US$1.45 million o f IDA funds remaining in the grant
ahead o f the 2009 hurricane season only cover part o f the year’s premium. C I D A has
agreed to fund the remaining US$ 1.12 million.
228. Avian Influenza. Two grants for a total o f US$2.6 million (US$1.6 million from
IDA, the remainder from the Avian and Human Influenza Facility) were approved in
2008 to support the Government in its efforts for prevention and control o f the Avian Flu
Virus. The grants will strengthen the MARNDR and the MSPP in their prevention and
control activities, as well as in the delivery o f public services to the population regarding
the closely linked human and animal health issues.

This TA grant compliments component four o f the US$20 million Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and
Vulnerability Reduction Project as well as component two o f the US$19.4 million Emergency Recovery
and Disaster Management Project.

ANNEXJ: DONOR
SUPPORT FORHAITI
A - The Interim Cooperation Framework
229. The transitional government that assumed power in March 2004 led, in
coordination with the European Commission, the Inter-American Development Bank, the
UnitedNations and the World Bank, a major effort to assess Haiti’s social, economic and
political needs and develop a program o f reform and recovery for the following two
years. Entitled the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF), this program set Haiti’s
funding needs at nearly U S 1 . 4 billion for 2004-2006. At an International Donors
Conference on Haiti at the World Bank in Washington in July, 2004, pledges comfortably
covered this amount.
230. Since 2006, President PrCval’s government has assumed leadership o f the
development program. The Government extended the ICF until September 2007 while
molding i t to reflect i t s own priorities, including road rehabilitation and projects in slum
areas. The newly inaugurated Government hosted an International Conference for Haiti’s
Economic and Social Development in Port-au-Prince in July, 2006. This paper and the IPRSP, produced two months later, were the main strategy documents o f the Prbval
administration prior to the DSNCRP.

B - Donor Support for Current Government Strategy
231. The DSNCRP provided a new policy framework for donor assistance. Most
donors have aimed to align support behind it. The DSNCRP adjusted overall priorities
from the previous, interim strategies but at the sectoral level it maintained general
consistency with these as well as with existing sectoral strategies. The document put total
financing needs for implementation o f the strategy at US$3.9 billion, o f which the
Government estimated in early 2008 that roughly half was already covered. A
conference planned for April 2008 to finalize implementation and monitoring
arrangements for the DSNCRP and raise funds behind i t was cancelled after the food riots
and the fall o f the Alexis Government.
232. A Conference on Haiti’s Economic and Social Development took place on April
14, 2009 at IDB headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Government raised U S 3 2 4
million o f additional funding behind the U S $ l .lbillion priority program i t had set out.
This program i s linked to the DSNCRP, and also reflects post-hurricane reconstruction
and recovery and budget support needs.
