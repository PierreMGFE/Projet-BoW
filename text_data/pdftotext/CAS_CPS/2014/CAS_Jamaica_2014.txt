EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
For over two decades prior to the 2008 global economic slowdown, Jamaica’s
small, open island economy had been stuck in a cycle of low growth and high debt.
The country’s high level of public debt and associated high debt service obligations
resulted in costly risk premiums, crowded out and distorted private sector investment and
left the country highly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. Moreover, like many
other Caribbean countries, Jamaica suffered recurring natural disaster related shocks that
exacted heavy tolls on Jamaican households and the economy as a whole.
2.
Jamaica was hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis and economic
slowdown, which exposed large vulnerabilities that had been building up for several
years. Real GDP declined by 1.6 percent in FY2008/09, with economic conditions
deteriorating sharply in the second half of the year and contracted further in 2009/10,
registering a decline of 3 percent just in the latter half of 2009. Bauxite production and
exports fell by about 60 percent, while remittances—a traditional source of support to
households and the balance of payments—declined by 33 percent.
3.
The poorest Jamaican households were disproportionately affected by the
economic contraction. Poverty rose sharply to 17.8 percent, eroding previous progress,
and disparities in the well-being of households and communities across the country
increased, particularly between rural and urban areas, leading to weakened social
cohesion. Households in the lowest two quintiles of the income distribution lost income
share (contributing to the observed rise in inequality) and unemployment soared. Overall
unemployment stands at 16.3 percent versus 9.8 percent in 2007, and youth
unemployment is now about 30 percent—with about 38 percent of young women
currently unemployed.
4.
Government efforts to stabilize the economy in 2009-11 showed initially some
positive results but were ultimately inadequate; the failure to address persistent
fiscal and debt issues, coupled with the impact of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012,
led to a crisis of confidence by early 2013. The Government prepared and entered into a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in 2010, but the program was interrupted just
a year or so later due to missed fiscal targets. In turn, the cancellation of the SBA, and
the consequent cessation of official flows to Jamaica, contributed to a crisis of
confidence, fuelling an increase in already rising interest rates and a significant
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, thus compromising Jamaica’s ability to refinance the
large public debt.
5.
Recognizing that reversing Jamaica’s trajectory requires wide-ranging and
deep reforms, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has embarked on a comprehensive
and ambitious program of fiscal adjustment and structural changes for which it has
garnered national and international support. In May 2013, the GoJ and IMF reached
agreement on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3
million) covering April 2013 to March 2017. The first and second reviews of the EFF
program, which supports debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation, and financial sector
reforms, were successfully completed in September and December 2013 respectively,
demonstrating the GoJ’s serious commitment to the reform agenda. Complementing the
i

IMF program, the World Bank Group (WBG) and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) are coordinating their assistance around a range of key structural and institutional
reforms aimed at laying the foundations for growth and competitiveness, and
strengthening social protection, public sector management, and resilience. Although the
fiscal consolidation included in the program will inevitably constrain growth outcomes in
the short-term, vigorous implementation of the reforms should help build conditions for
economic recovery, growth and greater shared prosperity in the medium term (especially
if accompanied by strategic investments).
6.
In the above context, the overall aim of this Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for FY14–17 is to support Jamaican efforts to help build the conditions for
sustained and inclusive growth. The strategy’s design recognizes that Jamaica is
presently at a juncture where decisive actions to achieve fiscal consolidation and stabilize
the economy in the short term must be paired with equally critical structural reforms in
order to move to a path of growth, reduced poverty, and enhanced shared prosperity. The
CPS program is concentrated in three strategic thematic areas: (i) public sector
modernization; (ii) enabling environment for private sector growth; and, (iii) social and
climate resilience. The CPS areas of focus were identified through a selectivity filter
aimed at maximizing impact. Selectivity criteria focused on areas that: (i) address binding
constraints to Jamaica’s development agenda and where government demand and
commitment are strong; (ii) align fully with the WBG’s comparative advantage; and (iii)
have the highest likely influence on poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
7.
The total financing envelope for the program is US$510 million, to cover a
series of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) and selective new investment
operations focused on creating conditions for growth and resilience. For quicker results in
protecting the poor and vulnerable, the CPS scales up successful interventions in social
protection, early childhood development and community development through
Additional Financing. With an active portfolio of US$262 million, and the authorization
to leverage up to US$500 million in local capital markets, IFC investments and advisory
services will target infrastructure, financial sector, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
and growth-related sectors. MIGA will continue to facilitate FDI and private sector
development, offering its traditional political risk insurance products across all sectors,
with a focus on infrastructure, energy, agribusiness and other growth related sectors. A
joint business plan (IBRD/IFC/MIGA, government and private sector) will support
implementation of the CPS’s second thematic area: enabling environment for private
sector growth. The program will also benefit from strong coordination with other
development partners. Despite relatively large front-loading, the program provides
flexibility in the mix of instruments and interventions to allow adaptation to changing
circumstances.
8.
Risks associated with this CPS are high, particularly in light of Jamaica’s
variable track record on macro and structural reforms. The country is entering a
demanding transition period, where tough reforms may result in significant adjustment
costs before they yield results in terms of growth acceleration, improvements in shared
prosperity, and poverty reduction. However, the potential rewards in terms of accelerated
poverty reduction and opportunity for growth are also high and the GOJ’s recent actions
to tackle tough issues and build broad public support bode well for successful
ii

implementation. The three types of risks that could affect successful implementation of
the CPS are: (i) macroeconomic, the interruption of reforms also due to new exogenous
shocks (economic or natural, including lack of FDI for critical projects) could result in a
still unstable macroeconomic framework; (ii) governance and political, if growth is slow
to materialize, the political capital of the government to support the heavy reform agenda
could weaken further; and, (iii) capacity, with the capacity to support the reform agenda
stretched to its limit, the government may not be able to operationalize fully some of the
reforms also slowing down the overall reform program.
9.
To address capacity deficiencies, the WBG program will be accompanied by
technical assistance in critical reform areas to build capacity and will include
vulnerability management as a key area of engagement. Although risks cannot be
entirely mitigated, they are reduced to some degree by GoJ’s recognition that the country
is at a turning point and by its actions to date vis a vis upfront implementation of a
number of difficult reforms, establishment of supervisory arrangements to ensure highlevel attention to the reform agenda, and the unprecedented social compact it has
established with key stakeholders to maintain broad support for the reform program.
Most of the reforms that are being undertaken aim at addressing supply side bottlenecks
to growth in a challenging global environment and uncertain demand response, exposing
Jamaica to risks of a delayed growth pick-up and underscoring the importance of
sustaining the reform effort. Notwithstanding these risks, the successful implementation
of the WBG program could help Jamaica to create conditions to bring the country back
on the path to growth, reversing the negative trajectory of economic stagnation, rising
poverty and inequality.

(GoJ) to respond to periodic external

shocks including natural disasters, creating
a vicious cycle of high debt and low growth which has persisted over the years. Jamaica
was hit hard by the global financial crisis, as bauxite revenues plummeted, Foreign
Direct Investments (FDI) and remittances declined, and the economy contracted by 1.9
percent on average per annum between 2009 and 2011. This contributed to the debt to
GDP ratio rising to 146.2 percent by end-March 2013, making Jamaica the most highly
indebted developing country in the world (Figure 1). The debt service ratio averaged 85
to 90 percent of revenue in recent years, leaving the GoJ with no option but to refinance
maturing obligations and with very little fiscal space for productive expenditures.
12.
Macro stabilization efforts initiated in January 2010, including an
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and a domestic
debt exchange, were halted in late 2011. A 27-month IMF SBA included an ambitious
plan for fiscal consolidation and other policy reforms that included the Jamaica Debt
Exchange (JDX). Complementing IMF and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
financing, the Bank provided a US$300 million DPL for budget support. The
Government had initial success with divestment efforts and made progress in the area of
tax administration, but the program was interrupted in 2011 due to missed fiscal targets in
the IMF agreement, thus halting official flows to Jamaica, just as interest rates were
turning upwards and rescheduled payments coming due.
13.
Persisting macroeconomic weaknesses, coupled with the impact of Hurricane
Sandy in October 2012, created a crisis of confidence in early 2013. By February
2013, the Jamaican dollar had depreciated by 15 percent over 12 months and foreign
exchange reserves barely hit less than half their level in 2010, compromising Jamaica’s
ability to service its large debt service payments. The current account deficit had declined
since 2011, when it hit a peak of 14.8 percent, but remained high at 10 percent of GDP,
keeping the economy vulnerable and exposed to exogenous shocks.
1

14.
In April 2013, the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) agreed on a
comprehensive package of assistance, comprising an IMF Extended Fund Facility
(EFF), and financial support from the Bank and the IDB. The GoJ signed the EFF for
SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3 million) for the period of April 2013 to March 2017,
which was approved by the IMF Board on May 1, 2013. The Bank and the IDB each
allocated US$510 million to Jamaica for the same period.
15.
Together, the three IFIs are supporting a set of structural reforms designed
to stabilize the economy, reduce debt and create the conditions for growth and
resilience (Figure 2). IMF support focuses on reforms expected to have a more shortterm stabilizing impact, such as debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation, and financial
sector reforms. The Bank and the IDB are supporting, in close coordination, structural
and institutional reforms in the areas of competitiveness, social protection, public sector
management, and resilience.
Figure 2. An Overview of IFIs supported Reforms in Jamaica

16.
Early macro and fiscal reforms adopted by the authorities in 2013 have
worked to start restoring confidence in the Jamaican economy. In the run up to the
IMF agreement, three important actions were carried out: (i) a second comprehensive
domestic debt exchange, which restructured 65 percent of GDP worth of debt and
contributed to a fall in interest payments from 25.5 percent of revenues and grants in
FY12/13 to 18.5 percent in FY13/14; (ii) a multiyear wage agreement with trade unions;
and, (iii) an upfront new tax package that significantly curtailed the use of discretionary
tax waivers. Since then, the economy has begun a slow path to stabilization as reserve
losses were contained and the exchange rate, while depreciating slightly, stopped its free
fall. The fiscal stance improved (Figure 3) as the central government primary surplus
reached 5.4 percent in FY2012/13 (compared to an average of 3.9 percent for the
previous two years). The financial sector absorbed the second debt restructuring well,
2

despite its high exposure to Figure 3. Primary and fiscal balance and total public debt
government debt, and did not utilize as percentage of GDP
the US$850 million support fund put
in place at the start of the IMFsupported program.
17.
The pace of reforms has been
sustained and Jamaica successfully
completed the IMF Program’s first
two reviews, in September and
December 2013 respectively. The
reforms include a demanding fiscal
consolidation effort, targeting an
annual 7.5 percent primary surplus
over four years and zero balance for
public entities. Achieving the fiscal
Source: Ministry of Finance and IMF
targets set in the program will require
implementing proactive measures for expenditure reduction and revenue enhancement.
At the end of the EFF third review mission in February 2014, the IMF reiterated that
policy performance under the EFF remains strong. In February 2014, citing this good
performance, Moody’s revised the outlook on Jamaica’s government bond rating from
stable to positive and Fitch from “CCC” to “B-“ with a stable outlook.
18.
Fiscal consolidation will improve prospects for debt sustainability, but the
debt overhang will persist. Apart from the strong fiscal consolidation, bringing the debtto-GDP ratio to the levels expected in the IMF-supported program will require the
implementation of debt for asset swaps and debt guarantee reductions, and the
implementation of additional measures to underpin a further three percent reduction in
the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2017. However, despite a reduction in debt service payments as
a result of debt restructuring, gross financing needs will remain high. The large financing
needs, coupled with reduced access to domestic markets post debt restructuring,
underscore the need for official creditors to play a critical role in financing Jamaica this
fiscal year.
19.
Growth has so far remained elusive. In the short term, growth is expected to
remain subdued (in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 percent for FY13/14), partly due to the initial
adverse impact of fiscal consolidation. In addition, growth prospects continue to be
obstructed by structural challenges affecting productivity and competitiveness. The
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) highlights that Jamaica’s disappointing
economic performance is traceable to low productivity. While Total Factor Productivity
(TFP) in Jamaica was growing above the world and regional averages in the 1960s, since
the 1970s performance collapsed despite high investment and has been lagging
significantly behind most other countries in the LAC region. A combination of: (i)
weaknesses in human capital and entrepreneurship; (ii) an inadequate business
environment, (iii) weak public sector management and discretionary tax policies; and (iv)
poor and inefficient infrastructure, are the main causes for the country’s low productivity,
and have resulted in low competitiveness and an enclave-based development model
(especially in tourism and mining) with little spill over to the rest of the economy.
3

20.
The economic outlook for the medium term is heavily dependent on
continued progress on the reform agenda. The GOJ has taken encouraging steps
towards structural reforms, including recent progress on privatization, tax policy reforms,
investment climate reforms, and efforts to build new infrastructure. This is expected to
gradually restore investors’ confidence, contribute to restoring macroeconomic
fundamentals, and create favorable conditions for economic growth (Table 1). On the
external front, the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, coupled with the on-going
fiscal consolidation and monetary restraint, can help improve price competitiveness and
contribute to narrowing the current account deficit and redirecting domestic savings to
the private sector.

However, downside risks are high. Jamaica is entering a demanding transition
period, where tough reforms may result in significant adjustment costs before they yield
results in terms of growth acceleration, improvements in shared prosperity, and poverty
reduction. Furthermore, most of the reforms that are being undertaken aim at addressing
supply side bottlenecks to growth in a challenging global environment and uncertain
demand response—there are risks that FDIs flow is reduced and investments may not
materialize in critical projects—exposing Jamaica to risks of a delayed growth pick-up
and underscoring the importance of sustaining the reform effort. At the same time, the
lack of fiscal space rules out public funding for infrastructure and makes it difficult to
cushion against exogenous shocks (natural disasters, commodity price fluctuations, and
changes in global demand) which could derail fiscal consolidation and set-back the
reform program.

determinants and shared prosperity in
Jamaica is lacking, it is clear that the
global economic crisis, together with increasing food and energy prices, resulted in a
significant increase in poverty: the official poverty rate soared to 17.6 percent in 2010,
and mean household income, particularly of the bottom 40 percent, contracted (Figure 4).
The crisis impacted strongly external sectors (bauxite in particular). After an impressive
decrease from 2001 to 2005, unemployment rose from 8 to 14.3 percent between 2006 and
2012 (April). Remittances from the United States and the United Kingdom decreased,
especially in 2009. Going forward, improved data quality and further analysis will help
better understand determinants of poverty.

1

All poverty numbers should be treated with caution since the poverty calculation methodology of Jamaica
is currently under revision and its data quality under scrutiny due to the composition of the consumption
aggregate used to monitor poverty, as well as the high (and rising) nonresponse rate characterizing the
Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC). In this sense, conducting a shared prosperity analysis may
have limitations in the short term, since the most important indicators refers to the distribution of
income/consumption (Sen Welfare Index and Gini) which can only come from living conditions surveys.

5

23.
The crisis hit the entire population, but the poor suffered the most, especially
in rural areas. As international and domestic prices for food and energy increased, the
bottom 40 percent of the population, for whom food consumption accounts for over 50
percent of expenditures, was strongly affected. According to official data, most of the
poor are concentrated in rural areas, where poverty increased the most (from 17 percent
in 2008 to 23.2 percent in 2010). Today, households in rural areas are bigger, dependency
ratios higher, unemployment and informal employment more widespread, and education
levels lower—all characteristics associated with a higher incidence and severity of
poverty. While lower than in rural areas, poverty rates more than doubled in Kingston
between 2008 and 2010.
24.
Women have also experienced a particular increase in poverty and
vulnerability (Annex 5). Female-headed households, which represent 52 percent of
households in Jamaica, account for 57.6 percent of the poor. Not only is the poverty rate
higher for female-headed households than for male-headed households but it also rose
more sharply —to 19.7 in 2010 compared to 13.3 percent in 2008—during the period
(Figure 5). While the crisis affected both men and women employment strongly,
unemployment rates have traditionally been higher for women across all age groups (and
in particular for young women) (Figure 6). In addition, Jamaica’s Gender Inequality
Index (GII) suggests that women have less access to human development opportunities
compared to men. The teen pregnancy rate (70 per thousand) is more than twice the
average for upper middle income countries and gender based violence is prevalent2.

Jamaica’s youth are among the most excluded and vulnerable segments of
the population. Unemployment is highest among young people aged 15 to 24, where
almost one in three is unemployed (38 percent of women and 25 percent of men in
2010).3 Today, it is estimated that 127,000 Jamaican youth are neither in school, nor
employed, nor on the labor market. As such, these youth are by far the most vulnerable to
risky and violent behavior. The profile of those directly involved and affected by violent
crime tends indeed to be young, unskilled, unemployed, and undereducated males aged
15 to 29 from underserved urban neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates.
C. CHALLENGES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND SHARED PROSPERITY
26.
Weak fiscal management and persisting structural challenges have kept
Jamaica’s economy trapped in a low-level equilibrium hindering sustainable and
inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Poor growth performance has occurred in
spite of political stability since independence in 1962, market-oriented reforms since the
1980s, and relatively high rates of private investment over the years. As the CEM
underscored, Jamaica’s growth prospects have indeed been obstructed by structural
challenges affecting productivity and competitiveness. To make things worse, most
recently, a series of exogenous shocks has contributed to a decline in private investments
and a substantive increase in public debt. To rebound, Jamaica needs to address the
challenges of fiscal and debt sustainability, public sector efficiency, weak
competitiveness, and economic, social and climate vulnerability and pursue policies
directed at improving poverty reduction efforts.
Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
27.
Trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth, rising public debt, and limited
fiscal space, Jamaica needs fiscal consolidation and better debt management. In
general terms, low growth has been a key factor leading to high fiscal deficits in Jamaica.
The ensuing large borrowing needs have led in turn to financial repression and
constrained private sector credit, investment and growth. The combination of continuous
public sector borrowing and low growth has contributed to high and unsustainable debt
ratios, leading to rising macroeconomic uncertainty. High debt ratios have been
accompanied by high debt servicing costs which reduce fiscal space and limit the
authorities’ ability to invest in infrastructure and improve public services that could
support growth. The ability to invest is curtailed further by a high and inflexible wage
bill, close to 11 percent of GDP and represents 35 percent of total expenditures, and by
interest payments that consume another 30 percent of total expenditures. This chain of
causes and effects creates a vicious cycle that needs to be broken through fiscal
consolidation and better debt management.
28.
However, fiscal consolidation alone will not eliminate funding needs. The
program supported by the IFIs is projected to sustain a progressive reduction in the public
debt to GDP ratio to 122.1 percent of GDP by the end of fiscal year 2016/17 (Figure 7)
and 99.9 percent of GDP by 2019/20 (Table 1). However, despite a reduction in debt
service payments as a result of the debt restructuring, gross financing needs will remain
high (Figure 8) with about $600 million due in amortization payments in the last quarter
3

The World Bank Development Data Portal, 2012.

of FY13/14. The large financing needs, coupled with a reduced access to domestic
markets after debt restructuring, underscore the need for official creditors to play a
critical role in financing Jamaica in the short term to help address its financing needs and
to support growth-enhancing investments which are critical to enable Jamaica to move
out of its current low level equilibrium.

Inefficient Public Sector
29.
Weak tax and custom administrations are an impediment to strengthening
fiscal management and to private sector investment and growth. In general, the
private sector and the general public associate public sector operations with excessive
bureaucracy. Flawed tax and trade policy frameworks and weak institutional capacity in
tax and customs administration are obstacles to investment in sectors where Jamaica has
a comparative advantage. The existing tax structure is cumbersome and plagued with
discretionary waivers which lower tax revenues, create distortions in the allocation of
capital and decrease the productivity of investment. Addressing these weaknesses will be
essential to complement ongoing efforts at fiscal consolidation and will contribute to
create the necessary fiscal space and facilitate increase investments.
30.
The operations of public entities, the public pension system, and contingent
liabilities associated with Jamaica’s high exposure to natural disasters present
sizable fiscal risks. The budget cycle is a source of inefficiency in Jamaica due to the
absence of clear alignment between planning and execution, making management of the
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) challenging. The absence of realistic
measurable indicators for sector programs hampers effective prioritization of public
current expenditure and investment. Strengthening such functions would foster trust in
the institutions of the State and provide investors with confidence in a stable and secure
environment.
8

Weak Competitiveness
31.
Jamaica’s weak investment climate and lack of innovation are hindering
private sector development and obstructing growth. Jamaica ranks relatively low in
investment climate related indexes, including the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business
Indicators. Key weaknesses include access to affordable energy (Jamaica is ranked 132 of
189 countries and the average retail tariff is US$0.35/kWh, amongst the highest rates in
the Caribbean), access to finance (private credit to GDP is 27 percent, well below the
upper middle-income group average of 48 percent), a distortionary tax regime, and
ingrained perceptions of corruption (in 2013, Jamaica was ranked 83 out of 177 countries
in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index). These constraints,
combined with low private sector confidence, waning public infrastructure, and lack of
innovation (Figure 9) are constraining competitiveness and preventing a stronger
contribution of the private sector to Jamaica’s economy.

32.
Although Jamaica is a small, open economy that has historically relied on
trade for a significant share of its GDP, structural obstacles have hindered its export
performance. Exports, which averaged 35.8 percent of GDP for the period 2003–12,
have been offset by significantly larger imports, averaging 56.1 percent of GDP over the
same period. The country has lost competitiveness in traditional products like sugar and
bananas and has moved to an enclave model implemented through Export Free Zones
(EFZs) in mining and tourism. The lack of competitiveness is linked to weaknesses in the
investment climate that enhance the cost of doing business, limited adoption of new
technologies, low levels of workforce training, and limited availability of specialized
professional manpower. Furthermore, while EPZs can play a role in attracting FDIs by
offsetting some aspects of the weak investment climate, spillovers to the rest of the
economy have been limited thus far.

High Social Vulnerabilities and Risks from Climate Change
33.
The Jamaican economy is highly vulnerable to risks, including economic,
natural disasters, and social risks. Among countries of comparable per capita income,
Jamaica is one of the countries with

and emergency relief programs, as
well as implicit liabilities, such as infrastructure rebuilding costs where recovery costs
have not been explicitly budgeted. Simultaneously, fiscal revenues are negatively
impacted by shocks through declines in tax revenues related to income, trade, and
property. In the absence of appropriate buffers, these risks also represent a threat to fiscal
and debt sustainability.
34.
Natural disasters represent a significant contingent liability for Jamaica,
with potential high economic and poverty impacts. More than 96 percent of Jamaica’s
GDP and population are located in areas at risk to at least two natural hazards, making it
the third most exposed country in the world to two or more hazards. Over the past 50
years, Jamaica has gone through a growing number of natural disasters, which have had
an increasing economic impact on the country, as evidenced by Hurricane Gilbert in
1988, of which the damages amounted to approximately 65 percent of the GDP. The
cumulative damage from the last three major storms (Ivan in 2004, Dean in 2007 and
Gustav in 2008) totaled over US$1 billion. Even the recent Tropical Storm Nicole (2010)
is estimated to have caused a fiscal cost of 1.9 percent of the GDP. Climate change is
expected to increase the impact of some of the hazards that already cause significant
damage. According to the World Bank study, “Sea Level Rise and Storm Surges”5, the
impact of sea level rise and intensified storm surges in Latin America and the Caribbean
will be highest in Jamaica with 28.49 percent of the coastal population exposed and
potential losses of coastal GDP projected to exceed 26.62 percent. In Jamaica as in other
countries in the region, poor populations are less resilient to natural disasters and they
suffer larger damages relative to their livelihoods.

4

Within the last 25 years, Jamaica has been hit by storms affecting over 1.8 million people and the material
damages approximate 26 percent of GDP.

Developing Countries”, Policy Research Working Paper No. 4901, The World Bank.

35.
Young people face increasing social risks. The largest segment of the Jamaican
population is below the age of 25 and the lack of services and opportunities poses a
serious risk for social and economic development. The limited access to good quality
basic health and education services for young children from poor households, negatively
impacts their growth and development opportunities later in life. Lack of investments in
the early years of childhood can have detrimental effects on growth and productivity later
in life. Furthermore, high unemployment among youth has created an urgent need for
skills development, jobs and the development of youth-focused policies and programs.
Youth marginalization, driven by lack of opportunities and high unemployment, is a
major social issue with significant links to crime, violence and teenage pregnancy.
36.
Despite a strong government effort and a remarkable reduction in homicide,
violent crime rates remain among the highest in the region. Crime and violence in
Jamaica6 reflect deep-rooted social and institutional problems, including organized crime,
general public distrust of the police, incidences of police corruption, and lack of essential
services and targeted interventions to address underlying risk factors. Crime and violence
disproportionately impact residents of poor urban communities and crime victims and
offenders tend to be concentrated among the poorest and among young males (about 90
percent of murder victims and more than 90 percent of offenders are male).
II. GOVERNMENT VISION
37.
The GoJ has launched a comprehensive program of structural reforms to
transform the economy. The program aims to ensure macro-economic stability through
fiscal prudence, address energy sector issues, develop human capital, optimize trade and
investment, advance justice and national security, resolve environmental and social
challenges, and implement transformative projects in key areas with growth potential. In
that context, the GoJ reform plan agreed with the IFIs includes a series of reforms aimed
at ensuring fiscal sustainability and creating conditions for growth, including through
investments in energy generation and efficiency, and in a number of sectors driving
growth and job creation, including logistics, information and communication technology
(ICT), creative industries, agriculture, and financial services. For GoJ, the development
of its logistics infrastructure is a national priority which could help Jamaica take
advantage of its strategic proximity to the Panama Canal whose expansion is expected to
result in increased trade traffic in the region. Another key initiative is the development of
ICT and creative industries that could have a significant impact on private sector
competitiveness while providing jobs for the youth.
38.
Reform implementation is supported by a dedicated institutional set up. A
National Coordination and Implementation Unit charged with monitoring reforms has
been established. The GoJ also established the Economic Programme Over-sight
Committee (EPOC) co-chaired by the Bank of Jamaica and the private sector to provide
oversight and monitoring of the IMF program. A Social Partnership Agreement (SPA)

was signed between the Government and the private sector, trade unions and the civil
society, and formed a broad coalition around the reform agenda to ensure the
sustainability of reforms and mitigate against a relapse of political commitment.
39.
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) provides a broader platform to engage
citizens and civil society on reform implementation. Jamaica hosted the launch of the
CGF in June 2012. Since then, the Government established a CGF National Chapter, and
engaged more than 200 people from private sector, government and civil society in
defining 23 key reform priorities in the area of logistics and connectivity, skills and
productivity and investment climate (Annex 4). The first reporting on implementation
progress was held in February 2014 in a workshop organized by the Government—
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and Jamaica Promotion Corporation (JAMPRO)—
in the framework of the Doing Business Roundtable of the National Competitiveness
Council.
40.
The reform program contributes to the implementation of the National
Development Plan (NDP) “Vision 2030 Jamaica,” which aims to transform Jamaica
into a developed country by 2030. The Plan, presented at the May 2009 Budget Debate,
is structured around four national goals: Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest
potential; the Jamaican society is secure, cohesive and just; Jamaica’s economy is
prosperous; and Jamaica has a healthy natural environment (Table 2). It seeks to address
critical development challenges and lay a foundation for inclusive and sustained growth,
building conditions for increased competitiveness and private sector-led growth. The plan
also aims to mitigate medium-term social effects of fiscal consolidation, build climate
resilience, protect social gains while moving toward fiscal and debt sustainability, and
build social cohesion. Finally, the GoJ recognizes that the failure to implement many
initiatives in the past was due to a weak institutional structure and is now committed to
improving the efficiency of the public administration.

WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP

A. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 2010-2013 CPS
41. The Jamaica CPS FY2010-2013 Completion Report highlighted a number of
lessons which were taken into account in the design of the new strategy. Overall,
the CPS program performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as the WBG made
substantive progress toward key expected outcomes: more than half of the
quantitative indicators have been reached (or exceeded).
Lessons from the Completion Report:
 Stronger focus on helping Jamaica in laying the foundations for economic recovery
and resumption of growth. While the CPS 2010-2013 areas of engagement remain
relevant, a sharper focus on increased competitiveness and private sector led growth
is needed.
 The WBG contributed noticeably to Jamaica’s human development and social
cohesion agenda. Building on this and scaling up of successful programs will help
achieve tangible results in the short term and maximize impact.
 Program flexibility is critical to provide enough space for adaption and innovation
in response to Jamaica’s financial and development challenges.
 The CPS program design needs to be ambitious but realistic about what can be
accomplished within its time frame in an environment characterized by constrained
capacity. Integrating more systematically political economy and capacity analysis in
program design, improving sector and program coordination and realistic timing
and sequencing of interventions would strengthen achievement of strategic
outcomes.
 The combination of IFC and Bank support for reform can achieve significant
positive long term results. For example, the Air Jamaica privatization is leading to
fiscal savings equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP per annum.
 An efficient monitoring for results system is needed to support CPS
implementation. The CPS result framework should be reviewed systematically as
part of regular WBG portfolio monitoring in conjunction with the CPPR. Building
on an improved coordination between WBG, IMF, IDB, EU and bilateral partners,
further collaborative efforts for joint monitoring of results should be explored.
B. CONSULTATIONS
42.
The CPS capitalizes on a wide-reaching participatory process and close
coordination with other development partners (Annex 3). The engagement strategy
supported by the CPS has indeed benefited from the participatory dialogue platform
provided by the CGF, on which Jamaica embarked in 2012. Furthermore, the CPS has
benefited from a Country Client Survey (Box 1) and wide consultations and monitoring
of the on-going stabilization and reform program, including through the SPA and the
EPOC. The CPS has also benefited from the active involvement of private stakeholders
through the EPOC, which was established with the objective of introducing greater
transparency to the Government’s Economic Reform Program while enhancing public
13

information and confidence. Donor coordination
has also been strong, especially through
coordination of the international rescue package.

context of the CGF process (May-August 2013) in partnership with the IDB, the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and Compete Caribbean presented yet another
opportunity to reflect on these issues.
C. PROPOSED WBG STRATEGY FOR FY14-17
44.
The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Jamaica in creating conditions
for sustainable and inclusive growth. In line with the National Development Plan and
in close cooperation with other development partners operating in Jamaica, the strategy
will provide selective solution-oriented support in three areas (Figure 11): (i) Public
Sector Modernization (ii) Enabling Environment for Private Sector Growth and (iii)
Social and Climate Resilience. The WBG program will help address some of Jamaica’s
chronic structural challenges, but only consistent government policies and long-term
engagement with all partners would bring growth acceleration over time.

45.
The proposed CPS is aligned with the Government’s development priorities
for Jamaica. The strategy is focused on Jamaica’s third national goal: “Jamaica’s
Economy is Prosperous”, and is supported by specific outcomes related to the other three
national goals (National Goal One: “Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest
potential”; National Goal Two: “The Jamaican Society is safe, cohesive and just”; and
National Goal Four: “Jamaica has a healthy natural environment”). In alignment with the
WBG twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the strategy scales
up successful interventions aimed at protecting the poor, creating opportunities for the
vulnerable, and helping communities to reduce poverty and address crime and violence.
At the same time, the strategy places an increased emphasis on helping improve the
enabling environment for private sector development and growth and addressing climate
change vulnerabilities as conditions for fostering sustained improvements in shared
prosperity.
46.
The CPS areas of engagement were identified through a selectivity filter
aimed at maximizing impact. Selectivity criteria focused on areas that: (i) are removing
binding constraints to Jamaica’s development and where government demand and
commitment are high; (ii) are aligned with the WBG’s comparative advantage7; and (iii)
have the highest likely influence on poverty reduction and shared prosperity (Figure 12).
This led to the identification of three areas of engagement and eight targeted development
outcomes.

7

Comparative advantage was defined as measuring the WBG’s global experience in a given area, its
analytical understanding of the specific area in Jamaica, and the success of current WBG engagement in the
area.

Public Sector
Modernization

Thematic Area 1: Public Sector Modernization
47.
Modernization of the public service is a necessary step in the government’s
efforts to generate additional fiscal space for strategic investments and facilitate
private sector development. Some of the problems that have afflicted Jamaica in this
regard include weaknesses in the budget process that affect the planning and execution of
public spending, inefficiencies in debt management, a heavy pension system that is
entirely funded by budgetary outlays, and a public sector investment program unable to
deliver growth dividends in its present un-prioritized way. Furthermore, Jamaica faces
challenges associated with tax and customs administration that undermine the investment
climate, inefficiencies in the operation and management of public entities, and weak
accountability mechanisms. The Bank will support the GoJ with activities focused on (a)
strengthening capacity to manage debt, the public pension system, and the public sector
investment program; and (b) improve the performance of public administration
institutions that are critical to private sector growth.
Objective: Improving Fiscal and Debt Management.
Outcome 1: Strengthened Government Capacity to Manage Debt, the Public
Pension System, and the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP).
48.
The WBG will support better fiscal and debt management. The Bank will
continue to support the development of an integrated strategic planning and budgeting
process, the implementation of a system of financial and nonfinancial performance
indicators, and the integrated financial information system for budget and cash
management. IFC will continue providing support on tax simplification. New WBG
activities will focus on strengthening the strategic debt management capacity of the Debt
Management Unit and the implementation of a new Debt Law, while addressing broader
structural issues underlying fiscal and debt sustainability, such as the sustainability of the
public pension system. In addition, in coordination with the IDB, the Bank technical
support will be provided to develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework that
looks at the fiscal impact of exogenous shocks.
49.
Strengthening the prioritization and alignment of budget planning with
execution will remain a key area of focus. To institutionalize the five-year PSIP, the
Bank will help to unify and harmonize procedures governing public investment projects
and help strengthen capacity for economic and financial analysis and prioritization of
public investment projects.
Objective: Improving Public Administration Performance
Outcome 2: Improved performance of public administration institutions critical to
private sector development.
50.
Boosting public sector performance and increasing accountability will take
important place in the GoJ’s reform agenda. The Bank is already assisting Parliament
in strengthening its public finance oversight capacity by making a more systematic use of
pre-legislative (including pre-budget) scrutiny. Going forward, the Bank program will
focus on strengthening capacity and improving performance in areas considered major
bottlenecks to private sector development, such as Customs and standardization.
Expected results include a reduction of 35 percent in the number of product certifications
17

and inspections for imports and services; and reduction of release time for imports at
Kingston port. The Bank and IFC policy advice and capacity building will help
strengthen PPP management to leverage private investments in a strategic and fiscally
sustainable manner. The Bank and IFC will also continue to provide support to the
Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ)’s privatization program under a broader MOU that
includes specific PPP projects (energy, transport waste water treatment and education). In
consultation with the IMF, the WBG will support the authorities with the introduction of
an institutional framework for PPPs. In addition, IFC will explore strengthening of public
and private agencies which can support food exports from Jamaica.
51.
Demand for good governance at the local level will also be targeted. Building
on good practices in Jamaica and other countries, the WBG will systematically
emphasize social accountability and demand for good governance across all areas of
engagement. Lessons learned and results that emerged from the Inner Cities Basic
Services for the Poor Project (ICBSP) on strengthening community capacity to monitor
and demand better services will be replicated across interventions at the local level. Use
of beneficiary feedbacks will be expanded wherever relevant. A flexible approach will be
implemented with the introduction of specific accountability components in operations.
The WBG engagement in this area will build on the public policy monitoring
mechanisms established under the CGF’s Jamaica Chapter and through the entry of
Jamaica in the Global Partnership on Social Accountability (GPSA).
Thematic Area 2: Enabling Environment for Private Sector Growth
52.
Jamaica’s weak business environment, limited technological innovation and
inadequate skills supply impede competitiveness and business expansion. On the DB
indicators, Jamaica lags behind its regional competitors in indicators such as ease of
paying taxes, enforcing contracts, registering property, and trading across borders.
Jamaica’s taxation on profits is particularly high when compared with its neighbors.
Surveys of Jamaican businesses point to tax rates, electricity, access to finance, practices
of the informal sector as well as crime, theft and disorder as the most burdensome
constraints on their operations.8 At the same time, SMEs in Jamaica with potential to
grow lack knowledge and skills to increase productivity, sell more competitive outputs
and generate jobs. They lack capabilities to integrate into dynamic value chains,
precluding them from high potential job growth business opportunities. The absence of
services for business development and support, standardized production and processing
capacities limits access to formal and higher value added domestic and international
markets and the longer term viability of small Jamaican enterprises. The education
system has failed to impart relevant skills for the private sector labor market.
53.
The WBG program will aim to help Jamaica tangibly improve the enabling
environment for private sector while focusing support in sectors that can be drivers
of growth through: (i) “horizontal” support to strengthen the general business
environment; and (ii) help foster the development of specific sectors with high or higher
potential (“vertical” support). The work will go beyond general DB indicator-based
reforms and will focus on industry level interventions aimed at removing gaps in the
8

Knowledge Series.

18

value chain. Analytical work and stakeholder consultations, including through the CGF,
identified the sectors of tourism, agribusiness, logistics, creative industries, energy and
ICT, as potential sources of increased competitiveness, jobs, and ultimately growth for
Jamaica. In these sectors, with the support of a Joint Business Plan (JBP) with the IFC,
the WBG program will target improvements in the business environment, infrastructure
gaps (with a focus on energy and transportation, and leveraging local capital markets),
higher entrepreneurship and innovation, and attraction of private investment.
Objective: Improving the business environment
Outcome 3: Improved business conditions and access to credit, in particular for
MSMEs.
54.
The WBG will work with the National Competitiveness Council and other
stakeholders on improving key areas of the business environment highlighted in the
2014 DB report. Particular emphasis will continue to be placed on tax regime, enforcing
contracts, trading across borders, customs regulations, electricity, and logistics services
and construction permits. To help improve access to credit, IFC will continue advising on
Credit Bureau legislation, as part of a regional harmonization plan, and will support
microfinance institutions to better adapt loan products to the local market, opening access
to finance to previously underserved market segments, such as small business owners.
The Bank will support financial inclusion work through a Development FSAP, the
improvement of credit information systems, and support a credit line and a credit
guarantee facility. Going forward, the WBG will assist the GoJ in developing a Logistics
Hub Initiative aimed at establishing Jamaica as a major hub in the global trading system.
This work will include assistance to the development of a Master Plan and the design of
legal and regulatory reform for economic zones, the development of logistics and the
removal of trade barriers, with specific attention to ensuring backward linkages to the
Jamaican economy. IFC will work with food sector SMEs and their public and private
institutions to help improve their investment climate and access to finance and markets.
IFC will also pursue its efforts to develop SME credit lines and trade financing lines
Outcome 4: Modernized and increasingly diversified energy sector and transport
infrastructure.
55.
To support infrastructure upgrade, IFC will mobilize private investment by
leveraging local capital markets for qualified projects, while the Bank will help
establish a PPP project preparation facility, to identify and study new investments and
subsequent attraction of FDI in key sectors. In an environment of fiscal consolidation,
IFC advisory services on PPPs will complement the Bank efforts. In an environment of
fiscal consolidation, local capital markets and PPPs offer alternatives to address
infrastructure needs by tapping the private sector resources. A more efficient energy
sector is important to alleviate the drain on the country’s fuel import bill, and the burden
of high electricity rates on businesses and consumers. The WBG will continue to provide
TA on policy and institutional support to the energy regulator and the energy ministry, in
particular for the development of policies and to expand clean and renewable energy
generation. Going forward the WBG will aim at mobilizing private sector investment for
fuel source diversification, including potential IFC support for natural gas and large-scale
energy efficiency improvements. IFC will remain active in supporting the upgrading of
the transport network, especially airports, via investment and advisory services.
19

Objective: Fostering Entrepreneurship, Skills and Innovation
Outcome 5: Enhanced technological adoption, improved skills mix, and fostered
investments in high potential sectors.
56.
WBG support will target technological adoption and innovation, and
improvement of the supply of skills in growth sectors, namely agriculture/
agribusiness and ICT. In collaboration with InfoDev, the WBG will help the GoJ foster
entrepreneurship, with particular focus on women, through public policies and publicprivate funded incubators that stimulate technology-enabled innovation, exchange of
knowledge, and expand the supply of skilled labor. Building on the successful experience
of Digital Jam 2.0 and KingsTOON, the WBG, in collaboration with various
development partners, will provide support to entrepreneurship in ICT and climate
change mitigation, and the development of creative industries. This work will help
increase youth employability and create some opportunities for jobs, especially for young
people, in the virtual global economy and in labor-intensive non-traditional sectors (e.g.,
animation industry). In the agriculture/agribusiness sector, the WBG will continue
working with the GoJ to enhance productivity, by providing support to groups of small
producers who represent a large share of the "bottom 40 percent", and by strengthening
alliances between groups of small producers and larger processors/wholesalers/markets,
thus creating linkages to domestic and foreign markets. This support will continue to
cover a range of issues, including sanitary and phytosanitary systems, market and weather
information, certification and standardization, and post-harvesting/processing to create
stronger links with the tourism industry and export markets. Going forward, the WBG
will help to attract large anchor investors with backward linkage potential as a critical
source of value-added, know-how, finance and linkage to more sophisticated markets.
With EU support, IFC will assist food sector SMEs (exports, food security).
57.
Implementation of activities in this thematic area will be supported by a
Joint Business Plan leveraging WBG support (Annex 7). The JBP will combine WBG
support for horizontal policy reforms of the business environment, with IFC investments
and advisory services and potential MIGA insurance in infrastructure, agribusiness,
energy and other sectors that have the potential to be future drivers of growth.
Thematic Area 3: Social and Climate Resilience
58.
Jamaica has embarked on an ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural
reform agenda, whose success depends on the country’s capacity to protect the poor,
reduce social vulnerability and enhance climate resilience. Austerity measures in the
short run could hurt the poor and vulnerable and lead to a potential increase in transient
poverty. Effective social safety net programs, targeted at the poor with the capacity to
identify, capture and protect those at risk present a critical social cushion during the
economic adjustment. Building human capital, starting from early childhood, provides
the foundations for a more resilient, stronger, and more prosperous society. Improved
management of climate risks and climate resilience will reduce productive losses in the
future, as well as the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation. Poor communities are hit harder
by natural disasters and strengthening disaster management will contribute to poverty
reduction and improvement of livelihood.

20

Objective: Enhancing resilience and reducing socio-economic vulnerabilities
Outcome 6: Strengthened social protection programs and improved institutional
capacity for their management.
59.
The Bank will continue its support to GoJ’s social protection program
(Program of Advancement Through Health and Education, PATH) by building on the
successful implementation of the conditional cash transfer flagship. Specifically,
additional support to the Social Protection Program (PATH2) will: (i) ensure continued
investment in human capital; (ii) strengthen the PATH institutional capacity and
programming; and, (iii) invest in opportunities for “graduation” of PATH beneficiaries,
by improving their skills and employability through the Steps to Work program. IBRD
will also continue to support the improvement in access to, and quality of, early
childhood services particularly for vulnerable households with focus on improved
screening and intervention for at risk children, increasing the number of early childhood
institutions that meet minimum standards of quality; support to certified parenting
education programs; and, scaled-up nutritional programs.
Outcome 7: Increased opportunities for poor and vulnerable.
60.
The WBG will continue to support strengthening social protection programs,
protecting and improving human capital, and fostering a more inclusive and
sustainable urban and rural development. These programs will help to create
opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups by improving: (i) quality of early childhood
education as a critical factor for improved education and labor market performance; (ii)
access to health, education and employment opportunities for poor and vulnerable
beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer program; and (iii) services and communitybased social cohesion through increased access to basic services in selected vulnerable
communities and strengthened capacity to implement and monitor programs for crime
prevention. Building on the successes of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund to
improving quality of life and reducing violence in vulnerable communities, the Bank will
scale up interventions in support of the GoJ’s program of “Community Renewal”.
61.
Support will also continue aimed at improving public safety in targeted
communities by increasing the ability to design evidence-based policies and programs on
crime and violence prevention and strengthening the capacity of the National Violence
Observatory to collect, analyze, and disseminate data and statistics.
Objective: Increasing resilience to climate change and natural disasters.
Outcome 8: Improved institutional capacity to plan and respond to climate change
events and natural disasters.
62.
The WBG will support the development of a comprehensive framework for
disaster and climate risk management and help Jamaica move from policies and
instruments focused on responding to natural disasters to a comprehensive risk
management strategy integrating risk reduction and disaster risk financing.
Environmental degradation and the impact of natural disasters pose particularly urgent
challenges to Jamaica’s economic and societal sustainability. Institutional strengthening
and provision of climate resilient infrastructure are critical to ensure sustainable
development. In particular, the WBG will contribute to: (i) building institutional
21

capacities to identify, assess and understand disaster and climate risks in terms of their
economic and fiscal (expenditure and revenue) impacts; (ii) improving the understanding
and cost-efficient use of financial protection instruments and mechanisms against
disaster, supporting Jamaica in building a cost-effective sovereign disaster risk financing
and insurance strategy; (iii) implementing priority risk reduction investments and disaster
risk management policies using customized financial solutions; and, (iv) strengthening
the catastrophe risk insurance framework. In addition, the Entrepreneurship Program for
Innovation in the Caribbean (EPIC) is establishing a Caribbean Climate Innovation
Center in Jamaica to fund climate change initiatives of start-up companies.

WBG FINANCING AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
FINANCING PROGRAM FOR FY14-17 CPS

63.
The financing framework for the CPS FY14-17 period provides for up to
US$510 million in IBRD resources. In light of the magnitude of the country’s financing
needs and the WBG commitment to support GOJ fiscal adjustment and reform efforts,
IBRD has committed to provide US$510 million over the four–year period of the CPS, in
conjunction with the IMF and IDB program of support. Given Jamaica’s fiscal
constraints in the short term, delivery of the program will be frontloaded in the first two
to three years, including though scaling up successful existing operations.
64.
About half IBRD’s commitment will be provided as Development Policy
Loans (DPLs) and the remainder through investment project financing (IPF). A
series of DPLs will support policy and institutional reforms in the WBG areas of strategic
engagement. The remainder will be mostly IPF, including three additional financing or
scale up operations (i.e.,

The WBG contribution to results in Jamaica in the early years of the CPS
implementation will be primarily through the existing portfolio; managing portfolio
for results is a key priority. The current portfolio, Table 4, consists of five investment
lending operations with a commitment of $153 million and one development policy loan
of $130 million. The largest investments are in the sectors of Economic Policy and Social
protection followed by Education, Agriculture and Energy which aligns well with the
focus of the CPS in the areas of growth and reducing social vulnerabilities. Portfolio
performance to date has been satisfactory, despite Jamaica’s fiscal space constraint and
all projects are expected to achieve their Development Objectives. The disbursement ratio
for Jamaica maintained a solid 29 percent from FY08-FY14. Currently, the only problem
project, Rural Economic Development Initiative, is being restructured to ensure
satisfactory performance. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 8 projects of which 7 were rated
“satisfactory” and 1 “moderately satisfactory”.

Bank projects in Jamaica partially use country FM systems. For example,
funds flow to projects through normal budget processes, but the country's lack of a
functioning Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) means that
specialized hardware/software is used to manage project accounting, financial reporting
and related processes. The Office of the Auditor General has audited four IBRD projects,
and this is expected to increase going forward. Project FM staff (like other PIU staff) are
often contracted specifically for project implementation; this is an area where greater use
of normal country processes (civil servants) could increase. GOJ has stated its strong
interest in greater use of country systems during the CPS period, and the Bank will
support this through a portfolio-level approach and through analysis during the design of
new operations. FM performance in the portfolio has generally been satisfactory. Project
FM staff participate in the Bank's annual fiduciary training, which has helped to fill
capacity gaps. No significant FM issues were identified during the last CPPR.
67.
With a current portfolio of US$262 million in investments and eight projects
valued at US$10.7 million in advisory service under implementation, IFC
engagement in Jamaica is focused on private sector development and shared
prosperity (Table 5 and Annex B3). Key areas include infrastructure (energy,
transport), access to finance (MSMEs, trade financing, and local capital markets), growth
sectors (agribusiness, and ICT), and education. Going forward, a special emphasis will be
on PPPs in infrastructure and education. With an authorized amount of up to US$500
23

million, the introduction of local currency instruments further leverages IFC resources
mobilization capacity. IFC’s advisory services are focused on access to finance,
investment climate, PPPs and value chain support in the food sector.

MIGA’s net exposure in Jamaica, as of January 31, 2014, amounts to
US$56.5 million and enables on-lending by the financial sector to an infrastructure
project. The continuing support to this transaction signals MIGA’s efforts to continue to
underwrite projects in Jamaica, facilitate inward FDIs, and contribute to the WBG’s
strategy of encouraging private sector development.
69.
A well-targeted program of AAA and convening services, including at
regional level, will inform policy dialogue and investment operations, and provide
support to reforms (Annex B4). Drawing on the inputs from multiple stakeholders—
GoJ, the private sector, and communities—the WBG will support the GoJ with
customized solutions that integrate global knowledge and expertise with financial
services including support work on poverty analytics. An important segment of the
program implementation will continue to be based on Caribbean regional studies and
collaboration through South-South exchanges. A cross-sector programmatic program of
NLTA, financed mostly through TF, will support the design, implementation and
monitoring of the policy and institutional reforms in the areas of debt management,
public sector reform, public finance and PPPs, social service delivery, poverty
monitoring, gender, and shared prosperity.
B.

MANAGING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION

70.
Reflecting lessons from the previous CPS, the timing, sequencing and
composition of IBRD financing will be managed flexibly, allowing for adjustments in
the choice of instruments and in the program weight across the three main areas of
engagement in response to evolving global or country conditions and priorities, including
progress under the IMF EFF. If necessary, in close partnership with other stakeholders,
the program could be adjusted. Frequent monitoring of portfolio implementation and
annual CPPRs will take stock of achievement of milestones and progress towards results
and will inform program implementation and adjustments as needed. To allow for greater
leveraging of expertise and products across the WBG institutions, the second strategic
area of the CPS will be based on the JBP. The JBP will be coordinated through a steering
committee with participation of the GoJ and private sector representatives and its periodic
reviews will complement the regular IBRD, IFC and MIGA portfolio reviews.
Beneficiary assessments will be used where feasible. A CPS progress report will be
prepared within 18 months of CPS implementation.
24

71.
The CPS program covers a small part of Jamaica’s development needs and
the WBG will continue building partnerships to leverage resources and enhance
impact. The WBG’s contribution is targeted at providing catalytic support, sharing
global development knowledge and expertise. Thus, coordination with, and leverage of,
other development partner financing will be important elements of success of the WBG
program. Bank support for policy and institutional reforms in the CPS areas of
engagement will be closely coordinated with the IMF, the IDB and the EU to maximize
impact and leverage. Coordination with the IDB will be strengthened further in the social
sectors, agriculture risk insurance and value chain support to small farmers, support for
customs reforms, public sector modernization, tax administration, and public investment
programming. Grant financing from DFATD and DfID will continue to support technical
assistance in public sector modernization. The WBG will also work jointly with the IDB,
CDB and DFATD on two on-going initiatives: (i) public-private sector dialogue on
growth through the CGF; and (ii) youth empowerment through creative, digital (Digital
Jam 2.0) and animation industries (KingsTOON). With support from DFADT, InfoDev
will continue supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and start-ups through the ongoing
EPIC program. IFC will continue to work with donors including DFATD, SECO and the
EU that are supporting IFC advisory services (PPPs, Investment Climate, Access to
Finance, SME and Sustainable Business Advisory).
V.

RISKS

72.
The overall risk of the CPS program is high and while some risk mitigation
measures can be taken, not all risks can be mitigated. Jamaica is entering a demanding
transition period, where major reforms may result in significant adjustment costs before
they yield results in terms of growth acceleration and shared prosperity. There is a risk
that political commitment weakens and social tensions increase, and the country is still
vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters. Materialization of any of or all of
these risks which could derail fiscal consolidation and set back the reform program. More
importantly, while the CPS program might succeed in achieving the objectives of
building the conditions for growth, growth might take longer to materialize. Demand
response to the structural, supply side reforms might not materialize if the global
environments remain constrained and/or demand rebounding may be limited by the lack
of competitiveness in the exchange rate. However, there is recognition that the country
could be at a turning point and the GoJ acknowledges the need to demonstrate credibility
and sustainability of its reform efforts to improve markets’ perception, while sustaining
social acceptability of the program and protecting vulnerable populations who are the
most likely to suffer the social and economic costs of adjustment.
73.
The CPS program faces three types of risks: macroeconomic, governance and
political, and capacity risks.
(i) Macroeconomic risk. The economic situation continues to be fragile, and the
Jamaican economy remains highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters.
The combination of a large current account deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, high
unemployment and tight fiscal space significantly reduces the Government’s flexibility to
25

adapt to unforeseen shocks which would put the fiscal and debt situation under pressure.
Even in the absence of shocks, meeting the ambitious fiscal targets will require sustained
effort and continued commitment from the authorities. Growth targets are ambitious, and
require both good policy and a favorable global economic environment. Going forward,
resumption of growth will continue to depend on the global economic environment, and
good progress on structural reforms alone may not translate into growth. Should macro
fragility cause the economic reform program to go off track, the country would likely
face substantial balance of payment and budget financing problems, the possibility of
debt default, sharp exchange rate depreciation and a spike in inflation. This would result
in a deep contraction of the economy and a rise in unemployment and poverty levels,
leading to a possible crisis. If this risk were to materialize, the programmatic DPL series
would be jeopardized and private sector investments be delayed.
Mitigation: While the Bank is coordinating closely with the IMF program to mitigate
macro risks, the CPS areas of investment lending and AAA would remain highly relevant
including by providing monitoring and supervision and providing on-demand technical
assistance. The program may require adjustment due to exogenous shocks or other factors
that cannot be anticipated at the outset. In that case, Bank financing would need to be
adjusted in coordination with the IMF and the IDB. In case of a program failure, the Bank
could reallocate the resources of the DPL series to social mitigation interventions that
would be scaled up. The IFC, in this scenario, while limited in its ability to commit new
investments due to negative private sector confidence, would increase its efforts to
provide support for the investment climate agenda. With IFC support, leveraging local
markets may provide some alternative financing options, especially in the absence of
FDI. The WBG would also explore opportunities for alternative entry points on the policy
and institutional agenda, as feasible, through convening services, knowledge work,SouthSouth exchanges, and sector level interventions.
(ii) Governance and political risks. Jamaica faces a heavy reform agenda which could
lose steam if negative impacts of reform begin to reduce political and popular support,
and if vested interests come in the way. The difficult reforms underway under the IMF
EFF have virtually exhausted the government’s political capital, harmed vested interests,
reduced spending and solicited heavy debate in Jamaica on the potential benefits of these
reforms. Reform fatigue and weakened political support may have a negative impact on
the structural reforms supported by the CPS. Moreover, if growth is slow in materializing
the political environment will not be conducive to further fiscal adjustment should it
become necessary.
Mitigation: While this risk can only be marginally mitigated, the WBG will work with
the government to accompany the reform process with policy dialogue and good
communication, and maintain close relations with the private sector. Efforts will also be
made to deepen the WBG’s understanding of the political economy in important reform
areas to inform the nature and scale of its engagement and adjust accordingly. Overall,
the large multilateral package may help maintain confidence that financial support is
available should the Government continue on the path of tough reforms. Under the DPO
series, the WBG will strive to balance the predictability of its financing with the strength
of the program implementation. Furthermore, the WBG will aim at supporting the supply
and demand sides of good governance through the CGF process, the GPSA for
26

strengthened social accountability, PFM-related activities, South-South exchanges, and
other interventions under Strategic Objective 3.
(iii) Capacity risks. The multi-faceted reform agenda raises the risk that government
capacity is stretched thin and implementation is delayed. Legislative capacity has been
stretched given the large amount of new legislation that needs to be drafted and approved
over the next few years. In addition, an ongoing public sector wage freeze has greatly
hampered the government’s ability to attract and maintain talent and made it difficult to
create new positions. Several of the reforms require the government to hire personnel
with scarce skills (e.g., debt managers, PPP transactions specialists). There is a risk that
the government will not be able to fully operationalize some of the reforms within the
envisaged timeframe and the limited fiscal resources could hinder the full execution and
roll out of the CPS agenda and action plans supported by the DPL. This risk also applies
to GOJ’s capacity to implement the large investment projects envisaged. In the past,
programs supported by IFIs have sometimes failed to achieve results because of lack of
capacity.
Mitigation: For the investment lending operation, the WBG will focus on scaling up
existing, well performing projects and programs that have demonstrated government
commitment while continuing its support for strengthening implementation capacity. The
DPL series will likely include some landmark legislation, in the areas of energy, customs,
telecommunications and disaster risk management that will set the framework for change.
To support policy actions underpinning the DPL, the WBG has secured financing for
training opportunities for existing staff in the MoF as well as for technical assistance,
including in the form of special advisors focused on design and implementation of key
reforms so that they might be able to take on some of these tasks without additional
hiring requirements. On-going TA is being provided in access to finance, doing business,
PPP, regulations for the debt law, non-communicable diseases and other areas.

INTRODUCTION

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the World Bank Group
CPS for Jamaica (FY2010-FY2013). It reviews the support provided to the country through an
integrated package of financing, technical assistance, knowledge products and partnerships; and
evaluates (i) the achievement of CPS program outcomes; (ii) the WBG performance; and (iii)
draws lessons for the preparation of the forthcoming CPS (2014-2017). A CPS Progress Report
(CPSPR) took stock of the Bank’s strategy implementation in August 2012. The CPSPR
validated continued relevance of the CPS objectives; identified emerging risks; and made
appropriate adjustments to the original CPS program and results framework where warranted.
This CPSCR uses the updated CPSPR Results matrix as the benchmark for evaluating CPS
program performance9.
A. JAMAICA’S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT
1.
During the CPS implementation period, Jamaica was hit hard by the global crisis:
tourism and bauxite revenues plummeted, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and remittances
declined. The economy contracted by 1.2 percent on average per year between 2009 and 2011,
and the economic recovery has been subdued. Poverty increased from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 17.5
percent in 2010. The contraction of economic activity, combined with low productivity led to a
rise in unemployment and informality, affecting especially women and the youth – 38 percent of
young women and 25 percent of young men were unemployed in 2013. The adverse economic
environment led the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) to adopt a more relaxed fiscal policy stance in
order to maintain key social services and avert further deterioration in living standards. This
compounded the effect of the crisis on public debt which rose precipitously to 147 percent of
GDP by December 2012.
2.
In order to improve the debt profile, and boost the economy, the GoJ launched an
ambitious reform program in January 2010 which included a successful domestic debt
exchange (JDX) backed by a 27-month IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and support from the
multilateral partners, including Inter-American Bank (IDB) and the WBG. However, the SBA
was abandoned in mid-2011 when the GoJ missed targets to adequately address key reforms and
meet agreed fiscal benchmarks. This resulted in halting official flows to the country and loss of
investors’ confidence leading to further contraction of the already weak economy.

9

The changes throughout the program are presented in CPSCR Annexes 1, 2 and 3.

32

3.
Early elections were called at end 2011 that led to a change in government. The
opposition People National Party won the elections with a mandate to restore macroeconomic
stability and rebuild the conditions for private-sector led growth. By end 2012, however, a
number of negative economic outcomes created a crisis of confidence. Economic activity
remained slow and investor confidence eroded further partly due to the delays in negotiating a
new agreement with the IMF. Continued macroeconomic challenges were compounded by the
lingering negative effects of Hurricane Sandy (October 2012). To avert a crisis and return to
macroeconomic stability and growth, an agreement was eventually reached in May 2013 with the
IMF on an ambitious macroeconomic program also supported by the WBG and the IDB.
4.
By early 2013, the GoJ and key multilateral partners reached agreement on a new
fiscal and growth agenda, supported by a SDR 615 million (about US$932 million) IMF
Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved on May 1st, 2013 and commitments by the WBG and
the IDB to make available US$510 million each in support of the reform effort over a four year
period. Announcement of these agreements and early success in meeting agreed benchmarks
have begun to restore confidence in the economy. The EFF program includes critical steps and
policy reforms to significantly improve the fiscal and debt positions while also supporting
growth-enhancing reforms. The economy has begun a slow path to stabilization as reserve losses
have been contained and the rapid devaluation of the exchange rate has been arrested while
continuing on a slower pace. The fiscal stance has also improved and the central government
primary surplus reached 5.4 percent in 2012/13, indicating that Jamaica could meet the ambitious
target of 7.5 percent for the following fiscal year and beyond as part of its commitments under
the IMF Program.
B. WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OF SUPPORT
5.
The CPS (FY2010-2013) was demand-driven and highly selective. The WBG focused
on two sets of challenges: addressing Jamaica’s immediate needs to weather the external shocks
while attending to the needs of most vulnerable populations; and laying the foundations for
longer term sustainable growth through broad-based and inclusive development. During the CPS
implementation, IFC increased significantly its role of strategic advisor and investor for GoJ and
private sector. Coordination between IFC and IBRD around common strategic goals was
strengthened and expanded. The CPS implementation has benefited from partnering with and
leveraging other partners’ funds, knowledge and innovation capacity.
6.
The CPS was aligned with Jamaica’s Vision 2030 and GoJ priorities articulated in the
Medium Term Socio Economic Policy (MTSEP). It was organized around three strategic
pillars: (i) Supporting Economic Stability, (ii) Promoting Inclusive Growth, and (iii) Promoting
Sustained Growth. Strengthening Governance was highlighted as a key cross-cutting issue and
key element of pillar III. The CPS was also based on extensive consultations with the
Government, other development partners, the private sector, and civil society. The mid-term
CPSPR validated continued relevance of the CPS objectives, and made specific adjustments to
the results framework. The conclusions and recommendations of the CPSPR have been reflected
in improved intra-Bank coordination, and collaboration with development partners.

33

II.

KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.
The CPS areas of engagement remain relevant for the new CPS (FY2014-2017).
However, stronger emphasis should be placed on improving Jamaica’s economic
competitiveness. The WBG made positive strides in the areas of social protection, early
childhood development, education, agriculture, urban security, and climate resilience. Yet, to
unlock Jamaica’s growth potential, the strategy needs a sharper focus on private sector-led
growth and increased competitiveness, while building on the success of its contribution to
Jamaica’s shared prosperity agenda.
8.
The WBG strategy incorporated sufficient flexibility to provide space for adaptation
and innovation in response to Jamaica’s financial and development challenges. The
combination of policy-based and investment lending allowed continued financing for critical
social programs when reforms stalled and foreign investments and official development flows
decreased. IBRD was able to leverage resources (mainly through TF financing)10, and publicprivate partnerships to develop innovative development initiatives addressing youth
unemployment, crime and violence, education and skills upgrade. Relying on its convening
power and extensive knowledge base, the WBG was able to introduce groundbreaking solutions,
such as those in support of creative industries that should be scaled-up in the future.
9.
The CPS program design should have been more realistic about what can be
accomplished in an environment of fiscal and capacity constraints. Integrating political
economy analysis more systematically in the design of the program and improving intra-Bank
coordination could strengthen the results framework and the relevance of its outcome indicators.
Going forward the WBG’s program needs improved sector and program coordination, simplified
project/program design and realistic timing and sequencing of interventions. In addition, given
Jamaica’s vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters, a comprehensive yet flexible
approach to help tackle short term crises while contributing to long term goals is needed.
10.
An efficient WBG monitoring system is needed to support CPS implementation. The
monitoring and evaluation of the results framework should be based on a joint WBG business
plan and reviewed systematically as part of the WBG’s portfolio monitoring in conjunction with
the CPPR. In order to avoid disconnect, the results framework needs to be fully aligned with the
timing and scope of the WBG program, with activities, indicators and outcomes forming a
logical results chain, and realistic CPS outcomes. Building on the improved coordination
between the WBG, IMF, IDB, EU, and some bilateral partners, further collaborative efforts for
joint results monitoring are warranted to enhance the development impact of all operations.
III.

CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

11.
Overall, the CPS program performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as the WBG
made substantive progress toward key expected outcomes: more than half of the quantitative
indicators have been reached (or exceeded). The overall CPS rating is based on the evaluation of
the specific outcomes and their contribution to the Pillars ratings (Table 1). Out of 20 objectives,

A. Overview and Principles of Engagement
12.
The main thrust of the WBG Strategy was to support the GoJ in its efforts to: (i)
mitigate the medium-term effects of the global economic crisis; (ii) protect social gains while
moving towards fiscal and debt sustainability; and (iii) lay the foundations for inclusive and
sustained growth over the medium to long term.
13.
The Bank followed three principles of engagement: responsiveness; adaptability; and
leverage and partnerships. These principles were derived from the experience of implementing
the last CPS and confirmed through Government and stakeholder consultations for the
preparation of the CPS 2010-13. Applying these principles, the CPS program built on existing
operations and relationships, and relied on development partners’ operations to maximize impact
while minimizing demands on the Government and WBG resources.
B.

PROGRESS BY STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT PILLARS

PILLAR I. SUPPORTING ECONOMIC STABILITY
14.
Overall, the program implementation under this Pillar was moderately satisfactory in
meeting the stated CPS objectives.11 Of the three CPS outcomes in the Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability Results Area one outcome was fully achieved; two were mostly achieved. Despite
the challenging implementation environment, major policy and institutional changes have been
accomplished. The legal and institutional foundations for structural reforms have been put in
place and serve as a basis for fiscal and debt sustainability along the lines of what the current
arrangements with the IMF are supporting.
11
The CPS outcome of achieving a reduction in Jamaica’s debt-to-GDP ratio from 139.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 124.2 percent in 2013 was
dropped from the Results Matrix during the CPSPR, as it was difficult to attribute the result, even if it was realized, to Bank interventions alone.

35

Results Area 1: Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
15.
Improving fiscal and debt sustainability in order to reduce debt overhang and reverse
the weak growth trajectory was one of the key objectives in Jamaica during the CPS period.
This objective was supported with a programmatic series of DPLs12 (Table 2), focused on three
interrelated challenges: (i) fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) transparency and efficiency of
public financial management and budget processes; and (iii) efficiency of the tax system. Due to
the long term nature of the program goals, lags in implementation (especially in FSDPL2), and a
combination of internal and external events, including change in government, and a court ruling
reversing the civil service wage freeze, progress was mixed. Of the 21 indicators in the DPLs
results framework, 10 targets were met, 7 were partially achieved and 4 were not met.
Table 2. Overview of DPO series – Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL (FDSDPL) and
Programmatic Debt and Fiscal Sustainability DPLs (FSDPL)

16.
Key success of the program is the establishment of the Fiscal Responsibility
Framework (FRF) and associated regulations that allowed for the application of prudent fiscal
management, and the creation of a sustainable institutional setup for managing debt. Supported
by a Bank team, the newly created Debt Management Unit is developing a debt management
strategy using Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) tool designed by the WB and IMF13. The
2011/12 and 2012/13 budget included for the first time a medium term debt management strategy
and a borrowing plan. Improved fiscal reporting discipline and accountability, and more strategic
debt management were introduced successfully and have enhanced the medium term fiscal and
debt sustainability.
17.
The program made significant impact by eliminating deferred financing of public
bodies. Some public bodies were divested or restructured, including several sugar producers and
the expected savings materialized. Working together with IBRD under its crisis response
operation IFC provided advisory services for the privatization of Air Jamaica, relieving the
Government’s fiscal accounts of a monthly average expense of US$15 million.
18.
Efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes was improved. For
the first time, the Fiscal Policy Paper submitted to Parliament (FY12/13) included detailed
accounts of both central government and the public bodies (although not presented in a fully
12

The program was evaluated by IEG and rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

consolidated manner), and the fiscal responsibility statement specified the level of fiscal balance
and debt. While progress has been made on prioritizing capital investments, some headway was
made in introducing Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) in public sector agencies.
Six pilot ministries and agencies had produced estimates of their current costs and medium term
expenditure projections, although not entirely integrated into the budget preparation process.
PILLAR II: PROMOTING INCLUSIVE GROWTH
19.
The results achieved under this pillar are rated Highly Satisfactory. Significant
progress in promoting inclusive growth was achieved through targeted programs in the areas of
education, health and social development. New approaches to delivery of social services in most
vulnerable and poor communities have been pioneered. All outcomes have been achieved or
exceeded in two of the results areas, while in the third area, in spite of changed Objective by the
GoJ, the agreed interventions achieved visible progress in supporting micro and small producers.
Results Area 2: Strengthening Human Capital
20.
Quality of social services in Jamaica was put on a sustainable path. This was achieved
through the introduction of decentralized decision-making, particularly in the area of resource
management in the school system; establishment and enforcement of minimum service standards
in early childhood development; provision of conditional cash transfers to poor and vulnerable
groups to increase access to education and health services, and opportunities for skills
development. All CPS objectives in this cluster were achieved and the overall rating is Highly
Satisfactory.
21.
IBRD supported the transformation of the education sector by focusing on establishing
the necessary infrastructure for a more decentralized system, with a view to eliminate the shift
system and to improve quality and access to secondary education14. New institutions in charge of
improving quality of education delivery – the National Education Inspectorate (NEI), Jamaica
Teaching Council (JTC) and National Education Trust (NET), have been set up and
operationalized. The newly established Department of School Services (DSS) is ensuring the
execution of the education sector policies and enforcing performance and accountability. About
65 percent of teachers have met professional standards for licensing; NEI established the
inspection system; and 100 percent of schools are implementing school improvement plans. All
new agencies have been allocated resources in the ESTP budget to operate.
22.
Under the GoJ National Strategic Plan (NSP), the Bank financed a pilot results-based
disbursement approach15 to improve early childhood development (ECD). In collaboration with
other development partners (CDB, IDB, OAS, UNICEF and USAID) implementation and
coordination across sectors was established. A system for monitoring child development and
screening for risks has been introduced for all children (0-3 years of age) using a Child Health
Passport. A management information system has been developed to improve the quality of ECD
services through registration and inspection of early childhood institutions (ECI) and
14
15

The cooperation between IFC and CIDA offered an opportunity for expanded advisory services in this area.
The results-based financing was an appropriate instrument for this sector as disbursements were clearly linked to preset targets and results.

enforcement of minimum service standards. The 20 percent target (2013) for registering and
issuing operational permits for ECI under the new system has more than doubled – reaching 52
percent. More importantly, this highly successful pilot in the Caribbean is expected to serve as a
replicable blueprint in the region.
23.
Significant strengthening of social safety nets was accomplished through the IBRDfinanced national Conditional Cash Transfer Program (PATH – Program of Advancement
through Health and Education). Coverage of targeted beneficiaries increased to more than
400,000 – higher than the initial target. The ongoing Jamaica Social Protection Project and the
Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) Grant “Jamaica Scaling Up the PATH Conditional
Cash Transfer Program for Poor Elderly and Disabled” contributed to the overall success of the
program that has encouraged beneficiary households to send their children to school regularly
and increase the number of their health care visits. Notwithstanding the undeniable success of the
program, the second phase should focus on improving benefits adequacy, and on increasing
opportunities for graduation of beneficiaries, in particular by upgrading youth employability.

developed as part of the Digital Jam 2.0. Another such example is the “KingstOOn” initiative
(see Box 1) which aimed at supporting the development of the animation industry also as a
source of employment for the youth. Future Bank interventions focusing on youth employment
38

and empowerment could assist Government build a well-targeted and resilient social protection
system by integrating and coordinating policies and programs focused on improved skills and
employability. These are two examples of small on-the-ground initiatives that can provide
substantial impact on reducing poverty and exclusion among younger generations.
25.
Key policy decisions in Jamaica were shaped through a number of analytical and
diagnostic studies in the area of human development. The Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM, FY11 May 2011) presented recommendations to the GoJ to address economic growth
with special focus on the deficient human capital. A Bank-led study on Financial Sustainability
of National HIV/AIDs Program provided policy options to ensure future sustainability of the
programs. The analytical work on Managing Nurse Migration II and Non-Communicable
Disease (NCD) provided detailed recommendations to improve NCD and Human Resources for
Health (HRH) policies and helped Jamaica and other Caribbean countries to determine their
positions prior to the UN High Level Meeting on NCDs. The Bank’s regional assistance program
continues a policy dialogue on implementing the recommendations on NCDs.
26.
With the Bank’s support, Jamaica became a champion for the first phase of the HRH
work which focused on nurse migration. In this context, broad consensus was reached in
priority policy areas of strengthening workforce monitoring, improving and expanding training
capacities, managing migration, and the need for a regional Caribbean approach. Jamaica is one
of the focus countries of a regional HRH study (that the Bank is leading), to examine policies
and practices that generate incentives and accountability mechanisms for health workers in the
LACR. The Bank helped the GoJ develop the national NCD strategy and action plan16.
27.
In education, health, and community development, the Bank program addressed
gender as a key driver for fighting poverty, crime and exclusion. Jamaica is part of an
innovative regional knowledge exchange program―Keeping Boys out of Risk Initiative. It
addresses boys’ underperformance at school as well as policies and programs to prevent and
tackle the issue. This initiative was funded by the South-South Trust Fund. Activities included a
Regional high level conference in May 2009, a good practices contest, and the preparation and
dissemination of a resource kit. Through the Social Development Trust Fund, the Jamaica
Country Office organized a call for proposals to improve Monitoring and Evaluation for grass
roots organizations working on youth at risk, including a gender perspective. In addition, the
Office organized training sessions via Video-conference on the fundamentals of Monitoring and
Evaluation for Non-Government Organizations. As complement to KingtOON and in
collaboration with the animation industry supporting Jamaica’s strategy on creative industries,
the Bank developed a Next GENDERation initiative designed to promote awareness for young
women groups on gender based violence. These groups use animation and other social media to
reach out to young women across the island with targeted messages on prevention and group
based initiatives for social support.

16
The report “Jamaica’s Effort in Improving Universal Access with Fiscal Constraints” addressed the issues Jamaica faces in reaching universal
health coverage.

39

Results Area 3: Crime and Violence Prevention
28.
All three objectives in this cluster have been achieved and the overall rating is highly
satisfactory. The Bank’s flagship program “Inner Cities Basic Services for the Poor” improved
quality of life in 12 Jamaican inner-city areas and poor urban informal settlements through
increased access to basic urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization,
enhanced community capacity and improved public safety. The improved infrastructure and
financial services have reached more than 60,000 residents (above planned target) in the
respective communities and is an example of a multi-sector initiative that has been successful in
addressing infrastructure gap, public safety and community capacity building.17
29.
The Bank was successful in applying an innovative approach to citizens’ safety. The
new methodology was evidence-based, and subject to rigorous process monitoring and ex-post
evaluation. It links the monitoring of crime patterns to programming facilitated by the
development of a cutting-edge crime and violence information platform and early warning
system – the National Crime and Violence Observatory.18 The Observatory aims at increasing
the capacity of the GoJ to collect and analyze data and design successful evidence-based
policies, and programs. This work is considered best practice in the Latin American Region.
30.
An essential element of the success of the program was the linkage between improved
social services and crime and violence prevention strategies that helped strengthen social
cohesion and public safety. As a result, public safety in targeted inner city communities has
improved through diverse interventions: mediation and conflict resolution; training on alternative
livelihoods; skills development; and linking groups at risk with existing family support
programs.
Results Area 4: Promoting Rural Development
31.
The specific outcome “medium-sized farms move up the supply chain” was not
achieved, because it was replaced on the GoJ’s request with “micro and small producers and
tourism service providers” during the CPS implementation. This made the specific outcome nonobservable, but significant positive outcomes have been accomplished under alternative
indicators. The second outcome related to capacity training of small-scale producers and service
providers was achieved. The overall rating for this results area is moderately satisfactory.
32.
To help improve market access for micro and small-scale rural agricultural producers
and tourism service providers, the Rural Economic Development Initiative (R.E.D.I.) is
providing matching grants to groups of producers in the tourism and agricultural sectors, to
introduce new technologies into the value chain. The number of direct jobs created in
communities receiving technical assistance has almost twice surpassed the expected target.
About 5,500 small scale farmers have benefited from capacity building initiatives and 5,200
17

The number of people who participated in education and employment programs or activities reached 29,777, which is 6 times higher than the
planned target; More than 1000 households above the targeted number received access to water, and more than 100 households above target have
improved access to sewer networks. More than half of the beneficiaries in these inner-cities have participated in programs or activities for
community-based crime and violence prevention and reduction. A survey and evaluation of the program impact has been carried out at end 2013
and will provide credible data about the level of improved security.

A JSDF Crime and Violence prevention grant continues to support the National Crime and Violence Observatory/Integrated Crime and
Violence Information System of the Ministry of National Security.

farmers are being trained in good agricultural practices. For example, the new practices in
growing yams resulted in 80 percent of the crop meeting export quality. Currently, R.E.D.I.
supports more than 1,500 small producers/entrepreneurs, about half of which are women and 19
percent youth. It is expected that it will increase the earning potential of rural communities
through the enhancement and development of agricultural supply chain linkages and communitybased tourist initiatives.
PILLAR III. PROMOTING SUSTAINED GROWTH
33.
The Bank’s assistance has focused on promoting sustained growth through
strengthening non labor competitiveness; improved access to energy; reduced vulnerability and
climate resilience; and strengthening governance. Of the 9 outcomes under this pillar, 3 have
been achieved; 1 – mostly achieved; 3 – partially achieved, and 2 – not achieved. However, the
formal ratings ‘partially achieved’ and ‘not achieved’ do not provide justice to the actual results
on the ground. Since objectives other than those in the Results Matrix have been pursued (on the
GoJ request) and achieved, the overall pillar is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Results Area 5: Strengthening Non-Labor Competitiveness
34.
The non-labor competitiveness results area is rated unsatisfactory. The specific
outcome of reduced electric utility losses cannot be observed and, in reality, does not reflect the
nature of WBG’s intervention (during the CPS implementation) that focused mostly on
regulatory reform. The outcome related to ease of paying taxes was partially achieved.
35.
Exploiting synergies of respective comparative advantages, IBRD and IFC are helping
Jamaica improve its competitiveness in the energy sector. The Energy Security and Efficiency
Enhancement Project (ESEEP)19 is supporting Jamaica’s long-term goal to reduce its reliance on
high and volatile oil imports. By supporting policy development and institutional capacity
building in the energy sector, the WBG is helping the GoJ to diversify the supply of electricity
through import of natural gas and development of domestic renewable energy resources (hydro,
wind, and solar). The IFC has been investing in generation capacity, while IBRD expects to
support public sector investments in efficiency and clean energy generation through publicprivate partnerships.20
36.
The Bank has been successful in supporting the GoJ in developing policy and
regulatory reforms for the provision of natural gas, energy efficiency and the expansion of
renewables that could reduce dependence on imported oil.21 Strengthening the regulatory
framework for private-public partnerships in the energy sector is underway in the Ministry of
Science, Technology, Energy and Mining and the Office of Utilities Regulation. A Bank-funded
TA is also supporting pre-feasibility studies for hydropower development; the development of
natural gas regulations; an evaluation of the capacity of the power grid to accommodate
19

The Bank does not provide direct investment to increase access or lower energy costs, therefore the specific outcome of increased energy
security and efficiency through reduced electric company losses cannot be observed, and should not have been included in the Results Matrix.
The CPSPR revised the target indicator for energy losses in the Results Framework downwards to 15.8 percent. However, because of fiscal
space constraints, the GoJ has further postponed the investment intervention.
21
Two regional studies that included Jamaica (“Mitigating Vulnerability to High and Volatile Oil Prices, Power sector experience in Latin
America and the Caribbean” and implications of the financial crisis on the energy sector) have provided analytical underpinning and options for
Jamaica to develop oil independence strategy.

renewable energy; and an assessment of needed modernizations of the electricity regulatory act.
To strengthen the financial capabilities of Jamaican financial institutions to invest in clean
energy, the Bank has established a line of credit/revolving facility through the Development
Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) to provide retail financing to the private sector for energy efficiency and
renewable energy investments.
37.
IFC has focused on investing in the energy sector to improve generation and
transmission capacity. Participating with a US$22 million loan and mobilizing additional US$37
million private investment in West Kingston Power Partners (a 65MW generating plant) IFC
helped upgrade some of Jamaica’s aging generation capacity. As of June 30, 2013, IFC has two
additional projects in the energy sector – Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd (US$37.5
million), which aims at reducing distribution losses and expanding generation via small hydro
and wind energy plants, and Jamaica Energy Partners (US$42.4 million, including US$25.5
million via syndication) which is generating additional electricity. With investments in three out
of the four large IPPs in Jamaica, IFC is playing a significant role in its energy sector by also
leveraging private sector investment. IFC cumulative investments and syndication in the sector
have amounted to US$309 million, financing a total of 315 MW out of total grid capacity of 800
MW. Overall, IFC’s investments have reached 713,600 people via power generation and
2,040,000 people via power transmission.
38.
IFC has contributed to improving Jamaica’s competitiveness by increasing its activities
in transport, using PPP in coordination with IBRD, and in the financial sector. IFC was the
transaction advisor to GoJ for the successful Air Jamaica privatization in 2010, and is providing
advisory services on the privatization of the Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA) in
Kingston. The NMIA privatization is the first transaction under a Memorandum of
Understanding signed in early 2011 between IFC and DBJ for joint transaction execution on
privatization policy, knowledge transfer, and capacity building. IFC has also been active in the
financial sector via 2 outstanding loan operations to 2 local banks (National Commercial Bank of
Jamaica, and First Global Bank), and working on Credit Bureau legislation, as part of a regional
harmonization plan. MIGA also continues to provide guarantee insurance coverage to a foreign
investor in the financial sector.
39.
The outcome related to reducing time for paying taxes has been partially achieved. The
number of payments was reduced from 72 to 36, while the required time to comply with tax laws
was reduced from 52 days to 36, which is below the target of 20 days.
Results Area 6: Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Reduction
40.
The climate resilience and vulnerability reduction results cluster is rated moderately
satisfactory. One outcome related to the policy level has been achieved ahead of target time; the
second outcome – reduced landslide risks in 4 communities has been mostly achieved; and the
third one is non-observable (not achieved) because of GoJ decision to delay implementation.

42

41.
To help integrate climate resilience in development strategies the Bank successfully
supported the GoJ in developing its Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR 2030)
that was presented and approved by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR)22 in
November 2011. The Strategy is focusing on (i) piloting approaches for integration of climate
risk and resilience into development policies and planning; (ii) strengthening capacities at the
national level to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scaling and
leveraging climate resilient investments; and (iv) enabling learning-by-doing and sharing of
lessons23.
42.
Responding to a Government request, the Bank channeled EU grant funds towards
reconstruction efforts after the passage of Tropical Storm Gustav ($1.8M). Seven schools and 5
health centers were rehabilitated and disaster preparedness and maintenance training was
provided for 45 people and 9 communities. The Hurricane Dean Economic Recovery Loan
($9.99M) facilitated: (a) rehabilitation/construction of critical public infrastructure; (b) provided
disaster response equipment, disaster simulation software, coastal multi-hazard maps and
vulnerability assessment for three poor communities at risk; and (c) trained community members
and youth first responders in community maintenance and disaster preparedness. In addition, a
multi-hazard mapping and vulnerability assessment study was carried out to strengthen disaster
risk management in three coastal communities. These Multi-Hazard Maps provide key data to
inform the management of environmental, physical and social infrastructure and thereby
reducing vulnerability.
43.
Important progress was made in reducing landslide risks in selected vulnerable
communities on a pilot basis. The ongoing Community based Landslide Risk Reduction (JSDF
grant of $2.38 million) project is strengthening the capacity of the national disaster management
agency on risk reduction and landslide risks and piloting a new methodology in four vulnerable
communities. A key contribution is the provision of MoSSaiC, an evidence-based toolkit,24 for
vulnerability reduction. The program provided training to 140 community leaders, government
officials and trainers for Landslide Risk Reduction, including the four pilot communities, where
the actual physical investments are under way.
Results Area 7: Strengthened Governance
44.
The governance results area is considered by the CPS as a cross-cutting matter that
seeks to contribute to (i) achieving a more efficient financial management and allocation of
budget expenditures, and (ii) enhancing the internal and external controls by supporting AuditorGeneral work in line with the new FRF. This results cluster is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Out
of the four outcome indicators, 2 were achieved and 2 were partially achieved.

22

The PPCR is one of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) -- interim funds developed by Multilateral Development Banks, participating
countries and other stakeholders to bridge the financing gap prior to agreement on the next climate change regime. The PPCR was designed to
enhance collaboration between MDBs and across Development Partners in assisting countries to address climate change adaptation. Therefore,
the Jamaica PPCR is jointly implemented with the IDB.
23
The PPCR will finance the SPCR to a tune of $25 million ($15 million in grants and $10 million in IDA-like concessional loan). This program
is being jointly implemented with IDB.
24
The Management of Slope Stability in Communities (MoSSaic) Regional toolkit was published in February 2013 and ODPEM has finalized
five chapters of the Jamaica-specific toolkit.

43

45.
A medium-term budgeting was introduced and a new prioritization tool for the public
investment program of six ministries (that account for 91 percent of the central Government
budget) has been adopted. Progress on multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure
policy and budgeting has been confirmed by PEFA repeat assessment (Feb 2013) from C+ rating
(PEFA indicator 12, 2007) to B in 2013. The indicator on scope, nature and follow up of external
audits was not rated by this PEFA evaluation, leaving this outcome without rating.
46.
The Bank supported the government in the implementation of its Auditor-General’s
operational plan and the development of internal audit plans within the ministries to enhance
availability and timeliness of public financial management information, and improved
accountability in the use of public resources.25 The AG made notable progress in improving the
quality of audits. The AG is conducting both compliance and performance audits in selected
areas, and the audit of the consolidated accounts of Government is done in a timely manner.
47.
The Bank is also piloting the Use of Country Systems for environmental and social
safeguards in Jamaica. The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) has adopted policies
equivalent to the Bank’s environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards. The diagnostic
work and institutional strengthening measures undertaken with JSIF were essential for JSIF
becoming the only public entity in the region to receive an ISO 14001 certification for
environmental management systems in 2009. The government has expressed interest in getting
additional support to capitalize on the positive experience and scale it up to other agencies.
IV.

BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE

48.
The Bank performance is rated as good. The CPS was highly relevant, and aligned with
the Government’s Vision 2030 and Medium term development strategy. The design and
implementation of the program successfully contributed to the pursuit of the key CPS objectives
and was adjusted on a timely basis to changing circumstances and priorities, including specific
requests from the GoJ. The design and implementation of the program contributed to achieving
most of the expected CPS outcomes, or set the track for reaching them in the future. The WBG
accompanied the GoJ in its efforts to operationalize Vision 2030 by supporting the development
and implementation of strategic policy and institutional changes while addressing the aftermath
of the global economic crisis. The country team leveraged significant sources of funding and
partner collaboration to provide consistent support to the GoJ agenda implementation. A sound
program of tested and successful activities is in place for the next strategy period.
49.
The performance was constrained by the political transition and limited capacity on the
ground for implementation in the expected timeframe. Resubmission to Parliament of several
previously adopted laws has delayed implementation of some public sector reforms. For
example, the Debt Management Law that was approved by the former Government had to be
reconsidered by the new Government. In some instances, timeframes were unrealistic,
particularly, when promoting innovative and/or complex reforms (taxation, audit, divestiture of
state owned enterprises). In addition, because of limited fiscal space, some programs experienced
delays in receiving counterpart funds such as planned investment operations in energy and basic
services.
25
The timeliness of annual appropriation accounts submission of selected MDAs to Auditor General has improved from 53 outstanding accounts
in 2010, to 22, as of March 2011.

44

A. DESIGN AND RELEVANCE
50.
Extensive consultations and deep understanding of the conditions and development
challenges of Jamaica have underpinned the CPS design. The strategic areas of engagement
were carefully selected by the country team to be consistent with key building blocks of the
Government strategy, while reflecting WBG comparative advantages. The CPS framework and
results areas were appropriately defined to address two sets of challenges: promoting long term
growth through broad-based and inclusive institutional reforms for sustainable poverty reduction;
and addressing the immediate country needs to weather the external shocks and stabilize the
economy while providing safety nets to most vulnerable populations. Consideration of other
development partners’ programs and synergies with IFC were part of the CPS design in the areas
of fiscal and debt sustainability, strengthening non-labor competitiveness, and governance.
51.
The design of WBG interventions for achieving the CPS objectives was relevant and
the mix of instruments appropriate. The nature of the country challenges required a thoughtful
combination and consistency of instruments and an appropriate balance between budget support,
investment lending, TA, and advisory services. There was a strong dependability between AAA
and financing, particularly in the areas of policy reforms. As shown in the Results Matrix, most
of the WBG activities involved extensive knowledge transfer, policy advice and technical
assistance that provided choices between different policy alternatives and proposals. The
adequacy of the program mix is reflected in the design and implementation of a DPL series to
address the macroeconomic issues, concurrently with several transformational operations like the
Early Childhood Development Program, Social Protection Project, REDI, and Inner City Basic
Services Project to address difficult social issues.
52.
While some of the interventions required longer than the CPS time horizon, calculated
risks were embraced to develop and implement innovative activities that laid the ground for
longer term development impact. In particular, the program design was flexible to leverage TF
resources (critical to a financed strapped economy) to finance activities like climate adaptation;
to test research findings and new approaches in areas like Crime and Violence and Youth
employment; and to adapt lessons learned from other countries to Jamaica’s social protection
needs.
53.
The design of the results framework was aligned with the WBG’s commitments and
most of the outcome indicators were relevant for measuring progress towards and achievement
of CPS objectives. However, some outcome indicators were associated with longer term
activities than the CPS timeframe, and proved to be too ambitious, particularly with respect to
the institutional reforms outlined in the DPL series, and the GoJ fiscal constraints that have
impacted the investments in the energy and rural sectors. Nevertheless, the achieved results are
in line with initial expectations and targeted outcomes. In hindsight, the design of the results
framework could have been less ambitious and more attuned to the limited implementation
capacity on the ground and the constrained fiscal space. Despite these limitations, the WBG
succeeded in delivering on most of the CPS outcomes.

45

54.
The CPS design recognized critical risks, identified mitigating measures, and
incorporated flexibility for innovation. The impact of the global crisis and the vulnerability of
the economy to external shocks (including natural disasters) were important factors in the
development of the WBG program. Taking advantage of the full range of instruments and
products offered by the WBG, the country team made priority adjustments or reallocated
resources (human, financial and budgetary) to respond to emerging needs (Tropical Storm
Gustav, Hurricane Dean), introduced innovative programs (“Digital Jam 2.0” and “KingstOOn”)
to generate youth employment opportunities in times of crises. The adverse impacts were
successfully mitigated through program financing adjustments in collaboration with other
development partners. Concerted efforts by the CDB, IDB, IMF and the WBG have contributed
to protect critical social expenditures, while pursuing the objectives of achieving fiscal
consolidation and unlocking growth.
B. IMPLEMENTATION
55.
The Bank followed the overall thrust of the CPS, while managing program risks and
making adjustments in response to the impact of the global crisis and other shocks. The Bank
responded quickly to the crisis with a series of DPLs helping stabilize the economy and the
worsening fiscal and debt situation. The success of the Bank’s program implementation was due
to the fact that the CPS was well aligned with the priorities of the GoJ, and well-coordinated with
its development partners.
Bank Lending
56.
The investment lending portfolio delivered the intended results: transformational,
particularly in the areas of social protection, urban development (linked to crime and violence
prevention), education and rural development. All potential investment projects identified in
the CPS were carried out, except for the Energy generation project. TFs were used to respond
quickly to natural disasters (Tropical Storm Gustav, Hurricane Dean and Sandy). Over the CPS
period the IFC portfolio expanded significantly and MIGA’s portfolio remained at planned levels
of operations.
57.
Delivery of WBG commitments during the CPS period was generally in line with initial
expectations. The CPS included seven operations, of which four were lending (2 DPOs and 3
investment lending) and two TF operations. This represented a total commitment of US$315
million (excluding TF operations); lower than the planned US$425 million for FY10 and FY11.
This difference is due to: a change in allocation for the Energy Efficiency project from $24
million to $15 million; and split of the second $200 million DPL into two with $100 million
disbursed in 2011 and the second dropped when the IMF program went off track in mid-2011.
The new Government, elected in December 2011, delayed policy decisions and reform
implementation in a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. During this period, the WBG
coordinated with the IMF and IDB the design of a new financing package – IMF Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) and WBG and IDB programs to support the Government agenda. The EFF was
approved in May 2013.
58.
Trust Fund resources served as a vital complement to the Bank’s program of lending
operations, technical assistance, and analytical work. During the CPS period a total of
46

US$11.4 million in Bank and Recipient Executed Trust Funds were leveraged. These TFs have
been effectively used in the areas of debt management, strengthening of parliamentary oversight
over public finance, climate change, social protection and crime and violence prevention. Trust
funds also supported analytical and diagnostic work on a number of critical issues: statistical
capacity and fiscal reform, poverty and social impacts analysis, and youth entrepreneurship.
IBRD Portfolio
59.
The current portfolio is solid, healthy and mature. The portfolio as of February 2014
consists of five projects with net commitments of $283 million and an average age of 4.5 years
(See Table 3). All projects are expected to achieve their Development Objectives, and two
projects have been extended. The latest ISRs rate four out of five active projects as satisfactory
or moderately satisfactory and only one as moderately unsatisfactory on the likelihood of
achieving their Development Objectives and Implementation Progress. The disbursement ratio
has steadily improved from 17 percent (FY09) to 35.1 percent (end of FY13). The two projects
that closed between FY10 and FY12 were rated as Satisfactory by IEG. During the course of
CPS implementation, the limited fiscal space has impacted projects implementation with
shortage of necessary counterpart funds (Education Transformation and Early Childhood
Development projects). The GoJ has been working with the Bank to fully fund those projects.
There are no projects or commitments at risk.

Fiduciary risks remain high requiring Team Leaders to pay particular attention to
institutional capacity during implementation. The recent CPPR identified procurement capacity
as a key bottleneck for project execution, followed by readiness for implementation of new
projects. It also highlighted that the high quality of the portfolio was due to the following key
factors: (i) Coordination between the GoJ, WBG and other development partners; (ii) Monitoring
and Evaluation, and good data collection; (iii) Monitoring safeguard issues and compliance; and
(iv) Following-up on Disbursements.
IFC Portfolio
61.
During FY10-FY13, the IFC portfolio increased from US$150 million to nearly
US$280 million providing significant additionality to the IBRD program. IFC committed a
total of US$200 million, including US$58 million from syndicating banks. As of June 2013, IFC
disbursed and committed portfolio totaled US$196 million and US$198 million respectively.
Syndicated loans outstanding (B loans), for which IFC is a lender, amounted to US$82 million.
47

IFC’s investment portfolio consists of eight active operations, and five advisory service projects
supporting MSMEs, Credit Bureau, Investment Climate and Public Private Partnerships for a
total of US$3.9 million. Jamaica is currently the IFC’s largest outstanding exposure in the
Caribbean.
Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA)
62.
Feedback from Government counterparts suggests that AAA products have been highly
valued. The Bank’s Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and Technical Assistance (TA) were
deemed very useful for the country policy dialogue and reform initiatives. The policy-based
support was complemented with institutional capacity building for the National Statistical
Institute; the Debt Management Unit; the Public Expenditure Division; and line ministries,
funded by TFs. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)26 and a social impact analysis of tax
reforms27 provided diagnostic and analytical support to the Government in developing the reform
policies and strategies.
63.
The WBG has improved its knowledge and insights of Jamaica’s constraints and
challenges through a number of analytical and diagnostic studies that helped strengthening the
quality of its own work, as well as influenced key policy decisions in Jamaica. The Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY11) provides deep analysis of the key causes that have stalled
Jamaica’s economy over the past four decades and presents recommendations to unlock its
growth potential. While the report’s objective is to identify the main constraints to longer term
growth in Jamaica, it also serves as a complement to the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ)
growth strategy: “Growth Inducement Strategy for Jamaica in the Short and Medium Term.”
These reports have served as critical diagnostic inputs in the design of the new WBG strategy.
64.
Sectoral and specific ESW have helped improve policy discussions in Jamaica on vital
issues and underpinned important policy decisions. For example, The Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIA): “Jamaica: Poverty and Social Impacts of Fiscal Reforms” explores the
distributional effects of the package of fiscal reforms initiated by the GoJ and supported by the
Bank under the programmatic fiscal sustainability DPL series with a focus on two reform actions
likely to have the most significant impacts: (1) tax reform and (2) public sector reform. It
informed the GoJ on the possible options for mitigating the negative impact of these reforms on
vulnerable populations. The analytical work on Managing Nurse Migration and NonCommunicable Disease (NCD) has provided guidance and recommendations for improved health
sector policies and human resource management in Jamaica and at the regional level. The report
“Jamaica’s Effort in Improving Universal Access with Fiscal Constraints” addressed the issues
Jamaica faces in reaching universal health coverage. Two regional studies that included Jamaica
(energy and implications of the financial crisis on the energy sector) have provided analytical
underpinning and options for Jamaica to develop oil independence strategy.
Monitoring and Evaluation
26

One of the key findings of the study is that Jamaica's disappointing economic performance is traceable to low productivity caused, inter alia by
distortionary tax incentives combined with 'enclave' development that does not spill over to the rest of the economy. World Bank. 2011. Jamaica Country Economic Memorandum: Unlocking Growth.

Country-level systems for poverty, economic, and human development monitoring are
being strengthened through government efforts and multilateral development partners’
support, including the Bank. The government has set up a national M&E coordinating unit
within the PIOJ, and is establishing Ministerial Focal Points to monitor the MTEF
implementation and the expected social outcomes. Building M&E capacity within the Ministries
remains a key priority. The Bank has provided a Statistics trust fund to help develop the national
statistics strategy.
Partnerships
66.
The WBG established a successful track record of collaboration with partners in
Lending and Trust Fund activities and in stimulating a dialogue on growth and
competitiveness with the GoJ and the civil society. Collaboration among development partners
on the growth and competitiveness agenda, and on improving fiscal policies and social protection
programs is an important national priority. The WBG together with CDB, IDB and EU has
provided budget support and additional programs to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and
protect social gains, together with operations supported by multilateral and bilateral partners
(IMF, EU, CDB and IDB). IBRD collaborated closely with the IMF, IDB and the EU in the
context of structuring the new IMF arrangement with the GoJ. The innovative work on Digital
Jam 2.0 and KingstOOn was done in collaboration with USAID and CIDA. Technical
cooperation and knowledge sharing serve as a basis for successful implementation of these
programs. IFC advisory program and several of the IBRD TA initiatives in the Caribbean are
also funded by CIDA, DFID and USAID.
V.

MANAGING RISKS

67.
The risks originally identified in the CPS were well managed. The CPS anticipated the
potential impact of the global crisis and the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. The
strategy successfully mitigated this impact through program adjustments and coordinated
financing with other development partners. Concerted efforts by the CDB, IDB, IMF and IBRD
have contributed to protect critical social expenditure, while pursuing the objectives of achieving
fiscal consolidation and unlocking growth. In support of this process, policy dialogue and
technical assistance in the areas of debt management, medium-term budgeting, parliamentary
oversight of budgeting process, prioritization of public investments, and communication on
policy reforms have improved the GoJ capacity to manage the economy. Fiduciary and
institutional capacity risks have been mitigated by having the same fiduciary team cover all Bank
projects in the country portfolio and provide regular training for implementing agencies on
financial management and procurement.
68.
The Bank also helped Jamaica manage its high vulnerability to multiple natural
disaster risks--particularly floods and hurricanes. The Government has insurance against
catastrophic natural disasters: Jamaica participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant, 1-in-15 year
disaster. The Bank is also assisting Jamaica through: (i) investments in natural disaster risk
mitigation; (ii) development of a risk atlas; (iii) a community-based risk reduction pilot; and (iv)
exploration of weather-related risk insurance for agriculture.

ANNEX 3: SUMMARY OF CONSULTATIONS IN JAMAICA
Introduction
The current CPS was developed through a combination of the participatory consultation
process, experience of experts in the field, lessons learned from the previous CPS and an
independent client survey. Discussions and ideas emerging from the youth events of Digital
Jam 2.0 and KingstOON and the CGF’s Jamaica Chapter were also used to inform the CPS.
This annex is a summary of the consultations held between January and September 2013.
Overview of the Consultation Process
The consultation process was designed using a participatory approach across all spectrums
of Jamaican society. Among the groups consulted were: (i) senior government officials, (ii)
academia and think tanks, (iii) international development partners, (iv) parliamentarians,
(v) private sector, (vi) civil society, (vii) trade unionists, (viii) youth groups, (ix) poor and
challenged groups living in vulnerable communities and (ix) the opposition.
The purpose of the consultation with the senior government officials was to discuss the
Government of Jamaica’s (GOJ) development priorities. Both the Government and the
WBG made presentations that facilitated discussions on the following: (i) GOJ key
development challenges and opportunities; (ii) lessons learned from past WBG support;
(iii) broader debt and growth strategies of the GOJ including the new IMF agreement; and
(iv) a proposed approach and priority areas for the new CPS. As a result, three development
objectives were identified: (1) Fiscal Environment and Public Sector Reform; (2) Growth
and Competitiveness; and (3) Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Resilience. These
pillars are consistent with the GOJ’s Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework
2012-2015 and the WBG’s strategy to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.
The purpose of the consultations with non-government entities was to present the plan for
the CPS according to the three development objectives and get the perspective of these
groups on WBG support and its relevance to the development needs of Jamaica. The
objectives of the consultations were: (i) to get the perspectives of each group on the main
challenges faced in Jamaica, and (ii) to receive feedback on the WBG’s present and future
role to support Jamaica’s development objectives. In particular, the WBG had extensive
consultations with youth groups and youths living in vulnerable communities.
The high unemployment rate amongst the youth (38 percent), and crime and violence
challenges particularly amongst young women, made this group both highly vulnerable to
negative economic shifts, yet potentially highly productive under the right economic
growth conditions. Each consultation followed the same format. A presentation was made
by the WBG on the proposed areas for support and the participants were asked to give
feedback on how the WBG could support the development objectives of the country.
Participants’ opinions and recommendations
The dialogue was open and free-flowing in all consultations. Participants were animated
and honest in expressing their opinions and gave valuable recommendations. The

58

discussion was opened by the WBG on the purpose of the consultation, current WBG work
in Jamaica and the three broad areas proposed for support. The challenges faced and
recommendations were discussed according to each area.
All participants agreed with the themes of the three pillars and felt that the WBG would be
able to provide adequate support if the program was structured around these three areas. In
all consultations the participants expressed concern for the debt and the cost of doing
business in Jamaica. It was agreed that immediate action needed to be taken to increase
economic growth, reduce the cost of energy and to reenergize investments.
Public sector modernization was of great interest to the participants who all agreed that the
public service needed to be revamped in order to improve government’s efficiency and
effectiveness. Almost all participants felt that the government efficiency was hindered by
outdated technology and heavily bureaucratic systems. The youth groups in particular
mentioned their willingness to support Government’s digitalization as it would create jobs
for them while increasing institutional efficiency, effectiveness and accountability.
The majority of participants agreed that investments in the agro-industry would
significantly help economic diversification. However, they felt that existing agriculture
industry was not attractive to the youth due to the lack of technology and the weak link
between investment and returns. Very few of the youth mentioned agriculture as possibility
for employment and referred to potential opportunities in the ICT industries. It was
suggested that the WBG could assist by helping to improve technology, marketability of
produce and adherence to international standards that would increase exports potentials.
Participants highlighted skills labour mismatch in the market and noted that graduates of
secondary and tertiary institutions were not adequately equipped for the job market. Many
felt that education and skills needed to be aligned with the needs of the economy. It was
suggested that further research be done to determine the skills of the future and that
universities and vocational institutions needed to be prodded in the right direction to equip
graduates with the relevant skills for the job market.
Summary of Consultations by Group
Senior Government Officials
The government officials were keen on focusing WBG support to areas that have affected
economic growth including, (i) bottlenecks such as the high cost of energy; (ii) limited
room to maneuver on the fiscal side and a narrow tax base which places high rates on those
sectors and agencies that actually pay tax; and (iii) the lack of resilience of the economy
and its response to macroeconomic and other shocks including weather related events.
Additionally the group requested support to (i)public sector modernization including egovernment to consolidate human resource management and providing a single tax
window; (ii) growth initiatives such as the logistics hub master plan which would be a
major income earner for the country; (iii) climate change initiatives, reef regulation and
institutional development; (iv) education and skills training; (v) the improvement and

59

expansion of the National Insurance Scheme program; (vi) legislation to mitigate
discrimination; (vii) employment insurance; (viii) and migration policy for skills retention.
Suggestions were made to add crime and public safety to the strategy as risks and reallocate
funds earmarked for health to education.
Academia and Think Tanks
Overall the group approved of the proposed areas for support. They (i) expressed concern
for government capacity to implement public sector reform, properly manage data and
maintain software with the introduction of e-government; (ii) suggested that the WBG
assist businesses to know and adhere to international standards; and (iii) highlighted the
agro industry as a key area for support and the impact of praedial larceny on the industry.
Additionally the group briefly discussed pension coverage, risk management, improved
language skills, WBG portfolio targeting and governance. They commented that the REDI
project was too limited in its targeting and suggested that it be expanded to incorporate
more actors and be more focused on knowledge sharing and issues of governance.
Trade Union Leaders
The trade union leaders felt that the areas for support were in keeping with their own work
towards a comprehensive labour market reform. Throughout the discussions they placed
great emphasis on developing a program for the working poor, as well as the revamping of
the pension system. They felt that the WBG could (i) provide technical assistance to the
government to draft a workforce adjustment policy that would better protect the rights of
workers in a transition particularly with planned changes in the Tax Administration of
Jamaica and Jamaica Customs; (ii) support education, innovation and skills training which
needs to be more relevant to the workforce of today and the future and influencing a change
in educational institutions; and (iii) work with the government to produce a proper national
identification system. They assured the WBG that they were not opposed to reform.
International Development Partners
The consultations with international development partners identified the following priority
areas: (i) vocational and skills training and preparation for market needs; (ii) tackling youth
unemployment; (iii) improved donor coordination of activities and strengthening the
capacity of the Planning Institute of Jamaica; (iv) attention to community based resource
management and assisting government to improve environmental policies; and (v) creating
an enabling business environment by reducing the costs of energy, doing business and
addressing crime and corruption.
Civil Society Organizations
The leaders of civil society organizations were in agreement with the three pillars for the
CPS as presented by the WBG and noted that it was an ‘excellent agenda to build on”.
While the three themes would cover all areas in need of development assistance, they felt
that climate change, poverty reduction needed to be worded into the pillars. They also felt
that the purpose could be reframed towards issues of equity and social inclusion and then
build out from that. Additionally they: (i) emphasized the need for climate change efforts to
go beyond infrastructure; (ii) noted that international development partners needed to put

60

more pressure on the government to address governance issues; (iii) would like youth
unemployment to be tackled; (iv) would like to see an improvement in the consultative
process; and (v) felt that venture capital was critical to growth of innovative businesses.
Youth Leaders and Groups
The youth welcomed WBG support in all these areas and outlined the most important
priorities as (i) improvement of accountability and transparency in the public sector; (ii) the
importance of e-commerce and the use of technology in the public sector; (iii) improved
public sector efficiency in service and delivery; (iv) rural development and youth
employment through agriculture; (v) the cost of energy, its impact on businesses and
standard of living and the need to use of alternative sources; and (vi) the development of an
awareness campaign to effectively educate the population of the development agenda.
Poor and Challenged Groups
The poor and challenged living in vulnerable communities spoke candidly on the issues of:
(i) public sector modernization to improve efficiency within the public sector; (ii)
connectivity especially for the rural poor who could benefit from telecommuting; (iii)
proper streamlining of the national identification system; (iv) access to finance and
guidance in business plan development; (v) praedial larceny; and (vi) unemployment.
Private Sector
The consultation with private sector (inclusive of membership organizations, business
leaders in banking, manufacturing, retail and ICT sectors) elicited the following views: (i)
the cost of electricity, praedial larceny and crime are major hindrances for growth and
strongly affected MSMEs; (ii) the logistics hub initiative has potentials but would require
the right business environment; and (iii) the focus for the growth and competitiveness
should be on the investment climate, skills and logistic connectivity. The group welcomed
WBG support to: (i) public sector modernization and reducing current public sector
inefficiencies and bureaucracy which negatively impacted doing business; and (ii)
improving access to finance for MSMEs and assisting to manage insolvency and
restructuring loans. A suggestion was made to provide the Scientific Research Council with
a subsidy so that they could lower the cost of giving support to farmers and agribusiness.
Parliamentarians
The parliamentarians suggested WBG support to address the issues of: (i) inclusion and
consideration of the disabled community in planning, consultations and programs; (ii)
agriculture as a part of the growth agenda and the associated risks; (iii) solutions and
innovative approaches to youth unemployment (iv) energy and the cost of doing business;
(v) functional literacy and its impact on growth; (vi) inflation and its impact on growth; and
(vii) bureaucracy and inefficiencies in the public sector.
Opposition
The opposition: (i) strongly urged the WBG to narrow the focus of its program so as to
increase impact; (iii) suggested support to the energy sector could be most transformative;
and (iii) emphasized that an impact could only be made through a demonstration effect.

ANNEX 4: THE CARIBBEAN GROWTH FORUM
The CGF is a multi-stakeholder platform designed to identify, prioritize and implement a
set of activities to improve the growth enabling environment in the Caribbean28, while
promoting participatory public policy making. It has so far engaged more than 2,500
representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, Government, private
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such
as Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; and, Skills and Productivity.
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight
of the top twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of
crime, and, growing vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of
the global financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the growth challenge in the region. After agreeing to a genuinely participatory
growth initiative and following consultations and preparatory work, the program started in
mid-2012 with a regional launch in Jamaica. The CGF is supported and facilitated by the
Bank, IDB, CDB, Compete Caribbean and the EU.
Key Outcomes
One year into the initiative, positive outcomes are already tangible: twelve countries
formally joined the process by establishing their national CGF chapter and completing the
first phase of national dialogue. This effort has led to the prioritization of concrete and
actionable activities and, in seven of the twelve countries, draft action plans are now
available, with details on each activity’ implementation plan.
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at a regional forum in The Bahamas
in June 2013. This allowed national stakeholders from government, private sector and civil
society to compare notes on each other’s’ priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each
identified challenges with technical specialists and peers. The high-level attendance (e.g.,
nine ministers, several Permanent Secretaries and Directors, over 300 private sector,
technical level officials and civil society representatives) sent a strong signal in terms of
both ownership and credibility. The Bahamas Communiqué issued by the Government of
The Bahamas during the event on behalf of CGF participating countries, attested to the
commitment of all parties to inclusive and participatory policy-making, accountability and
transparency in policy implementation as well as the CGF reform process itself. Each
government also committed to follow-up on implementation of the reform agenda, to report
back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months) and to enable independent monitoring of
the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives. The Dominican Republic
held its first Accountability Workshop in December 3, 2013. It should be followed by
Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica by the end of January 2014.
Participation in the process so far has been high, at both national and regional events
(including national chapters’ kick-off events and subsequent working group meetings).
Extensive media coverage also confirmed the importance of the initiative.

The structure and format of the CGF has also fostered a culture of transparency and
accountability: all information pertaining to the CGF process, all minutes and background
information are available online on the CGF website29. A balanced scorecard system will
be used by Governments to report periodically on each activity they agreed to implement,
while independent observatories are being established as a consortium of private sector,
academia and civil society organizations in each country. This constructive engagement of
all stakeholders is allowing finding solutions to the growth challenge collaboratively and
providing feedback on reforms results for citizens.
The CGF also helped generate and disseminate technical knowledge to inform policy
making, including 14 thematic technical notes, a report on debt, ten private sector
assessments, and a quarterly bulletin on Caribbean Economies since the beginning of the
process, providing useful technical inputs, and entry points for further engagement. This
will continue for the following year to address existing gaps and stimulate discussion in
new areas. National and regional dialogues have also helped identify emerging analytical
gaps above and beyond current areas of interventions, such as energy generation, efficiency
and distribution, or financial sector. Country ownership is not only ensuring high and broad
participation of all stakeholders to the process, it is also feeding critical information in the
national consultations on the development strategies in The Bahamas, Dominica, and Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, while at the same time helping align development partners in
defining their multiannual programming strategies.
In addition, CGF events have served as important catalyst for WBG, CDB, Compete
Caribbean and IDB teams’ engagement with each country, as evidenced by increasing
levels of exchange and dialogue since June 2012. Already a number of new lending and
non-lending operations are being put in the pipeline, tackling reform priorities identified
during CGF dialogues. A special CGF facility to fund the implementation of reforms in
individual countries has been created, and over US$6 million have been allocated for TA.
Two new lending operations in Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada are now incorporating
CGF proposals into their plans. As such, the CGF has been an effective mechanism for
development partner coordination. The continued engagement of the UK DfiD and the
Canadian DFATD as well as the increased interest of partners such as the EU, which joined
the CGF in June 2013, is a strong sign of the relevance of the CGF as a vehicle for
engagement in promoting sustainable growth in the region.
Finally, the CGF process has helped identify concrete priorities for regional integration30.
The inclusion of regional organizations in the process, such as CARICOM, the OECS
Secretariat, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank or the Caribbean Telecommunication
Union, aims to engage them in supporting the implementation of those regional proposals.
Going forward and parallel to the consolidation of progress achieved in each country, the
coming months should also help identify new reform priorities on which to engage public
sector, private sector, and civil society at both national and regional levels above and
beyond the three thematic pillars of the first year.

ANNEX 5: GENDER ISSUES
In Jamaica, a strong framework for advancing gender equality is in place. The
Constitution of Jamaica requires equality before the law for men and women and includes a
non-discrimination clause that explicitly mentions gender. A number of legislative acts
were adopted to address gender inequality, including the Domestic Violence Act and the
Equal Pay for Men and Women Act. Jamaica has made commitments for gender equality
and has an ratified major international conventions aimed at advancing gender equality,
including the Convention on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and
the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence
Against Women (Convention of Belém do Pará).
The Government of Jamaica has committed to redressing long-term systemic
discrimination against women in the National Development Plan. Further, the National
Policy for Gender Equality (2011-2015) lays out foundations for gender mainstreaming in
policies and programs, and the Bureau of Women’s Affairs is responsible for promoting
and supporting the implementation of the Policy. Moreover, there is a Gender Sector Plan
to address gender both as a result per se and as a crosscutting area of concern in specific
sectors. There is also a National Strategic Action Plan to Eliminate Gender-Based Violence
in Jamaica that identifies six priority areas of action. Results towards gender equality over
the last decade have been mixed: while some indicators have improved, others stalled or
even changed for the worse (such as maternal mortality ratio).
As in the Caribbean region in general, in Jamaica gender disadvantage in terms of
educational outcomes changes depending on education level. In terms of primary
enrollment rates, girls are at a slight disadvantage; while at secondary levels, boys are less
likely to be enrolled (female to male enrollment ratios are 95.3 and 103.2, respectively)31.
Male disadvantage becomes exacerbated at tertiary education, where the ratio of enrollment
rates reaches 228.8—the highest in the region, and almost twice the size of regional
average of 126.8. For both genders educational attainment dramatically dropped over the
last decade: for example, between 2000 and 2010 primary completion rates decreased from
90 percent to 73 percent for girls and from 86 percent to 74 percent for boys.
Some reproductive health outcomes are alarmingly high: maternal mortality ratio at 110
deaths per 100,000 births exceeds the regional average of 80. This is also a significant
regression: in 2000 maternal mortality ratio of 83 only marginally exceeded the regional
average. High maternal mortality ratio is especially concerning, given that nearly all
women (99%) receive prenatal care, and nearly all births (98%) are attended by skilled
staff, both indicators above the regional averages (90% and 96%, respectively).
Economic opportunities: Female labor force participation in Jamaica at 56 percent is
marginally higher than LAC average of 53 percent. Similarly, female to male labor force
participation rate of 0.82 exceeds the regional and world averages (0.67 and 0.73,
respectively). Unemployment is an enormous problem in Jamaica, especially among youth.
In 2011, 38 percent of young (15-24) women and 24 percent of young men were
31

Unless otherwise mentioned, all the data are from World Development Indicators for the latest year available
(2008 - 2011).

64

unemployed. Unemployment affects women to a larger extent than men: the adult female to
male unemployment ratio is 1.79 and the ratio for youth is 1.59 (2011). These disparities
are considerably larger than for LAC region on average (1.66 and 1.52, respectively) and
the world averages (1.43 and 1.34, respectively).
Although adolescent fertility in Jamaica reduced since 2000 from 87 births per 1,000
women aged 15 to 19 to 71 in 2010, it remains higher than the world average of 47.8.
Domestic violence is also high: according to the RHS from 2008-9, 17.2 percent women
aged 15 to 49, ever married or in a union reported having been physically assaulted by their
partners. According to available data32, the most common forms of gender-based violence
in Jamaica include domestic violence, rape or sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse and
sexual harassment, and the most vulnerable population group is the youth.
Violent crime is also high, and affects primarily men: the youth (15-29) homicide rate is
extremely high for males at 188 per 100,000; to be compared to 14.8 per 100,000 for
females. The world averages for homicide rates are 19.4 for males and 4.4 for females.
Also, males account for over 80 percent of hospital admissions for violence related injuries;
over a third of those are under the age of 30.
Political representation of women is low: only 13 percent of parliamentary seats were
held by women in 2011, virtually the same fraction as in 2000.
A Gender Diagnostic is under preparation. The study will provide gender disaggregated
basic poverty trends and gender indicators linked to the areas of focus of the National
Development Plan, as well as analysis of the legal framework for gender equality.

ANNEX 6: SUMMARY OF THE JAMAICA COUNTRY CLIENT SURVEY FY 2013

The Country Client Survey was conducted between April and May 2013 to assess the
relationship between the Jamaica Country Office of the World Bank Group (WBG) and its
stakeholders. The last survey was conducted in 2010. The sample cut across respondents from
the private and public sectors, academia and civil society. There was a respectable response
rate of 68 percent (108 of the 160 stakeholders invited to participate).
Perhaps the most significant finding was the reported level of familiarity with the work of the
World Bank Group in Jamaica. This year’s familiarity rating of 8.2 (on a 10 point scale)
marked a significant upswing from the 6.6 registered in the last survey conducted for FY10.
Additionally the WBG’s ratings for relevance, alignment with development priorities and
strategic realism (8.2, 7.7 and 7.6 respectively) have shown a marginal increase since FY10
(7.3, 6.5 and 6.4 respectively). The data indicated four key points of significance in the current
findings with respect to client perception:
Development priorities: There was a shift from crime and violence to jobs and education as
the main areas of concern, with some emphasis as well on equity in terms of shared
opportunities. In this regard clients mooted that jobs and education were the two areas where
the WBG could add most value to Jamaica.
Citizen Participation & Voice: There is a very clear signal that clients crave greater citizen
participation for more effective development and productive reform. Even where there is a
perceived failure of WBG programs locally, half the number of respondents attributed this to
inadequate citizen participation. They also link this to the issue of shared prosperity. In terms
of a solution, a quarter of the respondents suggested wider outreach as the most effective way
for the WBG to add value. There is direct reference to private sector and civil society.
Operations: Ratings on the WBG’s relevance, alignment to local development priorities and
realism of expectations have all increased significantly since FY10. Relative to other
development organizations in the region the WBG is also seen as most effective. The quality
of staff and mutual organizational relationships also received very positive ratings. Leading
the commendations were the interventions in public sector governance and reform. On the
down side, the quality of the WBG’s work in some high priority areas declined over FY 10.
This includes education, crime and violence and jobs.
Instruments & Knowledge: Respondents regarded the WBG’s technical assistance to be as
valuable as its financial support with a majority (55 percent) naming it as the WBG’s most
effective instrument. Nearly a third of respondents felt that WBG financing should be more
competitive while more than 25 percent wanted the process of obtaining finance to be less
complex. While the knowledge services of the WBG are highly rated and 64 percent of
respondents indicated the web site as the preferred source, there is a solid 50 percent that
expressed an affinity for publications and other written materials. (They were allowed 2
responses). The shift to electronic platforms will therefore have to be managed carefully.
