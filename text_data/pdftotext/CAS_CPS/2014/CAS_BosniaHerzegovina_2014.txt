COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY PROGRESS REPORT
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Board of Executive Directors discussed the FY12-15 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) on August 30, 2011 (Report No. 64428BA). This report focuses on how the Bank has responded to changes in the country context since
then, and how it will position itself strategically for the remaining period. It also provides initial
details on the impact of the catastrophic flooding that occurred during the finalization of this
report, and on the Bank’s response.
2.
In mid-May 2014, a major natural disaster struck BH, as the heaviest rainfall in
Serbia and BH in 120 years of recorded weather measurement caused devastating floods
and landslides. From May 13, the country saw massive flooding and over 3000 landslides.
Governments declared a state of emergency on May 14, 2014, and requested international
assistance. The floods touched about one third of the country’s territory, hitting hardest the
northern and central flatlands, where the main agriculture industry is located. The human cost
includes 25 confirmed deaths and one million people directly affected, with 40,000 evacuated
and sheltered in 42 collective centers/temporary accommodation facilities. Preliminary evidence
indicates the largest impact on infrastructure relating to housing, local infrastructure, transport,
water and sanitation, and agriculture.
3.
Initial reports indicate that damage is extensive and the productive capacity of the
economy has been shattered. Side roads and over 20 bridges have been destroyed or damaged,
preventing humanitarian assistance from reaching remote areas. Many crops have been
completely destroyed and livestock losses are severe, with possibly over 60,000 ha of farm land
affected. Water supply was severely interrupted in the affected areas; one million people were
deprived of drinkable water at the peak. Animal carcasses, contaminated water and debris pose a
serious threat to public health. Over 25,000 houses are damaged and 230 health and school
facilities fully or partially destroyed. Land mines that had been well-marked have been dislodged
and the warning signs washed away, making recovery efforts more challenging and
reconstruction more hazardous. The floods have created significant strains on the supply chains
for a variety of goods crucially needed to ensure the continuity of public services and economic
opportunities. For example, coal mines have been flooded, resulting in an interruption of supply
to the Tuzla and Uglevik thermal power plants (which together account for over one-quarter of
capacity and about 35 to 40 percent of generation). The plants are running on available stocks,
but these will run out in the next few weeks.
4.
The authorities have requested World Bank support for a recovery needs
assessment as well as an emergency recovery operation. A $150,000 Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) grant has been obtained. The recovery needs
assessment led by the government and supported by the Bank, the EU and the UN started on
May 29, 2014. The needs assessment will guide possible project restructuring; the emergency
recovery project ($57 million1, envisaged to be funded out of the Crisis Response Window) is
already under preparation. This operation is to support the governments of BH in reestablishing
public services and economic opportunities in flood-affected areas. It would finance emergency

disaster recovery goods and rehabilitation of key local infrastructure as well as technical
assistance and capacity building activities for the implementation of the project. In light of BH’s
imminent graduation from IDA, Board approval of this emergency operation by no later than
June 30, 2014 will be sought.
5.
The CPS was designed in 2011, with the overall objective of supporting BH’s EU
integration, the CPS’ broad objectives are to: (i) support economic growth by improving
productivity and competitiveness; (ii) improve social inclusion by strengthening the
targeting and fiscal sustainability of social benefits and improving delivery of basic public
services; and (iii) strengthen the sustainable use of key natural resources and improve
climate change adaptation. The CPS program was built on an analysis of BH’s key
development challenges and was kept flexible to reflect the continuous political uncertainty in
the country. The CPS envisaged total IDA/IBRD lending of $348 million of which $148 million
was IDA and $200 million was IBRD lending. IFC commitments were projected at $80 – 100
million. As of May 16, 2014, $250 million or 72 percent of the total lending envelope was
committed ($130 million – IDA; $120 million – IBRD), while IFC’s commitments reached $40
million (including $7 million from IFC-Canada Climate Change Program).
6.
The political system in BH is complex, reflecting the provisions of the country’s
constitution established to end bitter ethnic conflict nearly twenty years ago. The general
government sector consists of four units: the State (or central) level, two entities—Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS)—and Brcko District (BD). The State is
governed by the Council of Ministers; each entity has its own government and local government
units. In the FBiH, 10 cantons, each with its own government, represent an additional layer between
the Government of the FBiH and local government units.
7.
Political fragmentation and stalemate have undermined reform processes. As
recognized in the initial CPS document, the risk of weak political commitment to reform and of
policy reversal was significant. This risk has materialized as the authorities have failed to
advance sensitive reforms of social and veteran benefits that would have improved the quality of
spending. Consequently, the Bank cancelled its planned programmatic Public Expenditure DPO
series. The Bank then demonstrated flexibility and engaged in preparation of a new DPO because
the authorities expressed sufficient commitment to business environment and investment climate
reforms. Political fragmentation and stalemate remain the principal risks for delivery of the
program during the remaining CPS period. This may lead to slower than expected progress
against CPS outcomes and failure to deliver the full lending program. A flexible and
opportunistic approach is necessary to achieve meaningful results despite limited political
cohesion and will to reform.
8.
Political stalemate also undermined performance of the Bank Group program. In
FY13, two projects worth $160 million (38 percent of total commitments) faced repeated
effectiveness delays, and four projects were rated unsatisfactory temporarily in terms of progress
either towards development objectives or implementation. FY12 disbursement performance was
unusually strong, with the disbursement ratio at 40.7 percent, but in FY13 it deteriorated to 8
percent due to the effectiveness and implementation delays. At end-April 2014 it stood at 16.5
percent and is expected to reach 22 percent by the end of FY14.
9.
Progress toward CPS outcomes has been satisfactory with the notable exception of
fiscal consolidation associated with an aborted DPO series. The CPS has been flexible to
accommodate changing client demand and political cohesion. This CPSPR revises outcomes and
indicators to reflect the shift in focus away from fiscal consolidation (Pillar II) and toward
2

business climate reform (Pillar I). Three outcomes were dropped for lack of an associated
program, and the rest are either achieved or on track to be achieved by the end of the CPS period.
10.
BH graduates from IDA eligibility to IBRD-only status at the end of the IDA16
period. Although its per capita income has long exceeded the threshold for eligibility to IDA
funding, eligibility was extended to accommodate post-conflict needs. The graduation from IDA
is a complex milestone with important implications because the country has extremely limited
access to international capital markets. At the same time, the country faces a notable financing
gap in the medium term which is likely to widen in the outer years of the decade if the
commitment to fiscal consolidation remains weak.
11.
The CPS strategic focus on competitiveness, social inclusion, and environmentally
sustainable development remains valid for the rest of the CPS period, and is well aligned
with the World Bank Group’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. These objectives address a still-fragile economic recovery, continued social
vulnerabilities and lack of national cohesion, and the need to enhance competitiveness, growth
and job creation. Specifically, the focus on enhancing competitiveness provides a foundation for
job creation, opening up more opportunities for the poor and less well-off to improve their living
standards and contribute to economic growth. Enhancing social inclusion is also clearly linked to
the corporate goals by supporting increased access to economic opportunities for vulnerable
groups, particularly to labor markets and health services. The program is also working towards
promoting environmental sustainability in BH, an overarching goal of the World Bank Group.
12.
The Bank Group will continue to be selective and adjust the lending program to
reflect the political will to tackle structural reforms. In the course of this CPS, the Bank
made a strategic shift away from deeper fiscal reform (where political will was insufficient)
toward improvement of the business environment and investment climate, where ownership of
reforms was sufficient across all levels of government and results would stimulate growth and
jobs. For the remainder of the CPS, the IFC/IBRD/IDA program will maintain its focus on
reducing poverty and achieving shared prosperity by improving the competitiveness of the
economy, facilitating job creation and strengthening the delivery of basic services for the
vulnerable.
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

Political Developments
13.
In the first half of the CPS period, a series of political crises affected implementation
of the government’s programs. Continued political fragmentation marked the period 20112013. State-level Council of Ministers formation took 18 months after the October 2010
elections and as a result, the State level budget for 2012 was not adopted timely. Beyond
stymying structural reform efforts, that situation temporarily jeopardized foreign debt service.
Reshuffling of the FBiH government has not been completed 23 months after the June 2012
breakup of the ruling coalition. In the RS, the government resigned in block in February 2013,
but a new government was formed the following month. Overall, the internal political stalemate
weakened the country’s progress toward EU accession and delayed implementation of structural
reforms, including those earlier agreed upon with the IMF, the World Bank and the EU. More
recently, the government has made some progress on structural reforms with the support of the
IMF and the Bank. Both entities are now processing important reforms aimed at improving the
business environment and investment climate. The FBiH also adopted a pension strategy aligned
with the Bank’s recommendations.
3

14.
The domestic political situation continues to pose the most important risk for BH’s
development and for EU accession. A 2009 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights
(the “Sejdic-Finci” case) stated that BH needs to reverse a situation created under the Dayton
peace agreement that prevents ethnicities other than Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks from holding
elected positions. As a result of this and a lack of movement on an EU coordination mechanism
and on trade issues, the last EU Progress Report noted little advancement on the path to EU
membership. The EU reduced by around EUR47 million ($60 million) the 2013 Instrument for
Pre-Accession (IPA) funding for BH, and suspended discussion of further IPA-2 financing for
the 2014-2020 period pending progress in these areas.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
15.
BH’s economy performed poorly in 2012 due to weak internal and external
economic environments. After two years of fragile recovery from the 2009 recession, BH
experienced a second downturn in 2012 (Table 1). Deteriorating external conditions, especially
the prevailing uncertainty in the Euro zone, a severe winter at the start of 2012, and wildfires in
the second half of that year all negatively affected economic activity. Consumption, investment,
and exports each slumped in 2012. Industrial production also dropped, mainly due to weak
external demand for BH exports.
16.
A surge in exports supported a modest economic recovery in 2013. After 14
consecutive months of negative growth rates, industrial production picked up by 4 percent in the
first ten months of 2013. Manufacturing grew by 9.7 percent compared with the same period in
2012 - significantly higher than the 5.7 percent in September - and intermediate goods by 15.6
percent, suggesting some revival in the manufacturing sector. Exports of goods grew by 9
percent in the first three quarters of 2013 compared with the same period of 2012. Internal and
external risks to this recovery remain, including a slow recovery in the EU, which could
prejudice exports, and a slow-down in fiscal revenues, which would affect the 2014 budget.
Economic and political risks are discussed in more detail below.
17.
Macro projections were prepared prior to the floods and will be updated once the
damage and loss assessment is completed. The impact of the recent floods on economic
activity in BH is not known yet, however downward pressure on the recovery is expected in
2014. Preliminary information indicates that agriculture, industry, and mining are especially
affected. The floods have harmed numerous small and medium size businesses in manufacturing
and farming, and have hit predominantly areas with low and middle income households.
Reconstruction efforts will partially counteract the negative effect on economic activity,
provided adequate financing for reconstruction becomes available. A pickup in construction
activities, investment and consumption (as lost items are gradually replaced) is expected. With
increased domestic activity, a reversal of the current deflationary trends is possible.
18.
The currency board continued to support monetary stability and inflation remained
low into 2013.2 Inflation was around 2 percent in 2012 (with core inflation below 1 percent) and
the country experienced deflation of 1.5 percent in the first ten months of 2013. International
reserves, which are crucial to maintaining monetary stability, remained at a comfortable level
during 2013 (at around 5 months of imports). Given BH’s reliance on a currency board which

KM 1.96:EUR1.

4

limits the scope for monetary policy, flexible labor markets and sustainable fiscal policies are
exceptionally important to maintain macroeconomic balances and boost economic growth.
19.
Labor market participation and employment remain stubbornly low and below precrisis levels. Preliminary 2013 Labor Force Survey (LFS) results indicate that labor market
participation in 2013 is just under 50 percent of the working age population. The employment
rate in 2013 remained one percent below the 2008 (pre-crisis) level of 33 percent. The
unemployment rate at 28 percent remained elevated compared with 23 percent in 2008.
Unemployment is particularly high among those without tertiary education, women, and young
people. The poor investment climate and labor market rigidities have greatly contributed to the
persistent unemployment problem in BH. Labor market outcomes are poorer for those in the
bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, as they have lower employment rates than the rest
of the population due to higher unemployment and lower participation rates.
20.
After two years of large current account deficits, the external deficit narrowed in
the first half of 2013. From 9.6 percent in 2012, the trade deficit declined to around 6 percent of
GDP in the first three quarters of 2013, thanks to higher exports of electricity and goods. Imports
of goods were 3.6 percent lower in the first three quarters of 2013 than during the same period of
2012. A blend of foreign direct investment (FDI), grants, foreign credit and remittances financed
the external account. FDI performed well in 2013, with investments totaling 2.6 percent of GDP
in the first three quarters of the year compared with 1.9 percent in the first three quarters of 2012.
However, a part of this increase was due to a surge of investments from Croatian companies
wanting to maintain access to CEFTA markets following Croatia’s accession to the EU in mid2013. FDI slowed considerably in the third quarter of 2013.
21.
Remittances continued to be an important source of financial flows for BH.
Remittances held up during the crisis and remain a major part of foreign financing. In 2012,
remittances in the narrow definition (workers’ compensation and remittances) amounted to 10.8
percent of GDP and in the broader definition (narrow definition plus private current transfers) to
16.6 percent of GDP. Remittances were largely unchanged in the first three quarters of 2013 but
have declined slightly as a percent of GDP.
22.
Although the banking sector remained relatively stable in 2013, a high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) continues to plague the system. Many of the foreign-owned banks,
which dominate the banking system, gradually deleveraged in the years after the global financial
crisis. Some of the largest banks in BH shrank their balance sheets to repay deposits or loans
from their parent banks. Banks’ foreign liabilities, which accounted for 31 percent of total bank
liabilities at end-2008, represented 18 percent at end-2012 and fell further to 15.6 percent by
October 2013. Moreover, the quality of banks’ credit portfolios deteriorated for the fourth year in
a row alongside the stagnant economy, pushing NPLs to 14.3 percent of total loans at end-June
2013. Provisioning for these rising NPLs, is at around two thirds. Although reliance on parent
banks has declined, continued global financial market turbulence or a further downturn in Europe
could make it more difficult for banks to raise funds from parent groups if required to deal with
NPLs. In addition, the regulatory framework for dealing with NPLs needs further strengthening.
23.
BH faces significant fiscal challenges exacerbated by declining revenues. The
authorities began fiscal consolidation in 2010 and reduced the deficit to 2.6 percent in 2012 from
5.5 percent of GDP in 2009. In 2012, weak economic performance brought revenues down by
1.3 percent of GDP, with direct taxes and social security seeing especially large falls. To
maintain a sustainable fiscal stance in the face of declining revenues, the authorities took some
measures to reduce expenditures, but government spending remains overly concentrated in non5

growth enhancing areas. Efforts to contain current spending in 2012 were weak. Wages and
social benefits together amounted to 27.7 percent of GDP in 2012. Social benefits are not
adequately targeted with only an estimated 37 percent reaching the poorest quintile and over 12
percent going to the wealthiest quintile in the country. This leakage is largely due to excessive
spending on war-related benefits, which tend not to reach the neediest.
24.
The extension and augmentation of the Stand-By agreement with the IMF in
January 2014 will continue to support the financing of the 2014 budget. The BH public
sector financing needs for 2014 amount to around 4 percent of GDP, of which 1.4 percent is the
deficit and the remainder debt amortization. In January 2014, the IMF completed the fifth review
of BH’s economic performance under a 24-month SBA and extended the program through endJune 2015 to provide an anchor for economic policies during the election period and the political
transition. 3 However, the IMF has not been able to complete the sixth review under the SBA as
some fiscal targets and structural benchmarks were not met.
25.
Total public debt is considered broadly sustainable. At the end of 2012, BH’s public
debt reached 45 percent of GDP, of which 28 percent was external debt. This external public
debt is predominantly on concessional terms to international financial institutions (IFIs). Total
public debt is expected to decrease slightly to below 45 percent in 2013.
26.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework assumes a slow economic recovery in
the region and in the EU in 2014 (Table 1). Overall, the economy is estimated to have grown
by 0.8 percent in 2013 and is expected to expand by 2 percent in 20144, driven mainly by
recovering export demand. Over the medium term, growth is projected to increase gradually to
around 4.0 percent by 2016, based on increased exports and continued stable inflows of
remittances. Significant progress in implementing structural reforms will be important if BH is to
achieve faster economic growth than currently foreseen.
27.
Strengthening public financial management, including debt management policies
and practices, as well as focusing spending on growth-enhancing areas, will be an integral
part of reinforcing fiscal sustainability and ultimately increasing BH’s medium-term economic
potential.
28.
The medium to long term growth potential of BH’s economy is also constrained by a
weak business environment. BH, ranked 131st out of 185 economies worldwide on the Doing
Business index, is the worst-ranked country in Southeast Europe. Businesses face a large
bureaucratic burden, complex governance structures, overlapping provisions between different
levels of government and lack of transparency and consistent enforcement.
29.
External and internal risks threaten the macroeconomic outlook. Since the outlook
assumes sufficient recovery in Europe for BH to see continued export growth, external risks are
related to deterioration in the European economy and a potential rise in interest rates due to
monetary policy tightening in the US and EU. The EU countries remain BH’s largest trading
partners, hence an anemic recovery of the Eurozone would have a negative effect on BH’s
economic outlook through a number of channels: a reversal of the increase in exports seen in the
3

The authorities entered into a 24 month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in September 2012. On Jan 31, 2014, the
SBA was extended by nine months and five days, increasing access by SDR 135.28 million to meet additional financing needs
expected to arise mainly in late 2014.

This estimate was prepared prior to the 2014 floods; growth projections will be updated once the damage and loss
assessment is completed.

first half of 2013; a potential reduction of remittances; and a potential decrease of capital flows.
The Bank is adjusting its support to help address some of these risks by supporting alignment to
relevant EU systems, including EU inspections systems for export promotion. In addition, as
liquidity conditions tighten in the US and, eventually, the EU, interest rates could increase,
making it more challenging for the entities to raise financing through short-term debt. Internal
risks are posed primarily by the challenges of reconstruction following the devastating floods
and by domestic politics. BH’s political environment presents a tough background for reforms;
the October 2014 general elections are likely the single largest risk for implementation of
planned reforms. To address these risks, the Bank Group is ramping up stakeholder engagement
across entities and political parties. Also, financial sector vulnerabilities, including the high level
of NPLs and lack of an adequate regulatory framework, persist. The Bank is paying greater
attention to the financial sector through increased monitoring and analysis as well as technical
assistance to the Financial Stability Unit of the Central Bank.
30.
BH will no longer have access to IDA funding at the end of this IDA replenishment.
The last IDA resources will be delivered this fiscal year. This is a complex milestone with
important implications as the country has extremely limited access to international capital
markets. The country is facing a notable financing gap in the medium term, and the cost of filling
that gap will rise as the country’s access to concessional financing ends. Access to IBRD
resources will be consistent with a strong and continued lending program after graduation from
IDA, in line with the country’s performance and IBRD capacity.

Social Developments
31.
Living standards were rising and poverty declining prior to the 2008 crisis, but past
gains likely were eroded since. The period 2004-2007 was marked by strong GDP growth
averaging 6 percent per annum. Headcount poverty--measured as the fraction of the population
7

with incomes below BAM 205 per person per month—was 14 percent in 2007, almost 4
percentage points less than in 2004. Poverty was assessed to be primarily rural, with rural
poverty twice as high as that in urban areas, and three out of four poor people living in rural
areas.5 Although poverty estimates are not yet available post 2007, empirical simulations suggest
that the GDP decline over the last years has led to a rise in poverty. Data restrictions currently
prevent the estimation of a shared prosperity indicator for BH.6
32.
Widespread poverty and high unemployment triggered massive protests throughout
the country in February 2014. The protests quickly spread from Tuzla, once the industrial
center of the country, to main cities across BH. Initially violent, they continued more peacefully
afterwards with protesters demanding new and accountable governments, jobs, fight against
corruption, and social equality.
33.
BH has made significant progress in promoting gender equality, yet gender gaps
remain particularly in access to economic opportunities and agency. Significant gender gaps
persist in labor markets, with low female labor force participation rates (32.5 percent in 2013)
and lasting gender wage gaps. Moreover, gender inequalities in agency also exist in the country,
with relatively fewer women than men participating in politics and leadership positions.
Although data are limited, the high incidence of domestic violence is also a source of concern.
Annex 5 and Box 1 (below) present more details on the gender situation in BH.
Box 1: Gender issues are being integrated into the Bosnia and Herzegovina program
The World Bank Group program in BH proactively mainstreams gender issues to address existing inequalities.
First, for all projects in the pipeline, gender issues are being considered and included from the early stages. For
example, the recently approved (FY13 Q2) Real Estate Registration Project includes raising public awareness of
legal rights of women and producing sex-disaggregated data on real estate ownership to narrow gender gaps in
women’s access to assets.
Second, the gender dimension is also being actively incorporated in selected projects in the portfolio. The ongoing
Irrigation Development Project is strengthening its gender dimension through (i) a project desk review to identify
opportunities to address gender inequalities, and (ii) engaging in discussions with the Project Implementation Unit
and relevant key stakeholders, together with a gender specialist, to identify, address and raise awareness on gender
challenges in the project area. Furthermore, in the context of the Real Estate Registration project, the Bank
organized (with grant funds from the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality of the World Bank) a regional
leadership training for key Government and non-Government stakeholders in the Western Balkans on land and
gender issues, including those from BH. The objective of the training was to promote practical and proactive sector
reform initiatives to modify attitudes, norms, and systems in order to facilitate women’s land acquisition and full
utilization of land and property rights.
Finally, BH will benefit from analytic and advisory activities with important gender components, including
analytical work on employment and job creation, the existing regional program on poverty, the Gender Monitoring
in the Western Balkans program and the activities under the recently approved Trust Fund “Promoting Gender
Equality in the Western Balkans” with support from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and with
a focus on women’s access to economic opportunities.

As per the 2009 Poverty Update.
Due to restrictions in data access, available poverty estimates are only available up to 2007. However, a recently signed MoU with the statistics
offices is paving the way to providing more updated poverty and shared prosperity numbers and analyses.

III. CPS PROGRESS, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS

A.

CPS IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS TO DATE

34.
Progress towards CPS outcomes has been satisfactory for the competitiveness and
environmental sustainability pillars but less so for the social inclusion pillar. The CPS has
been flexible to accommodate changing client demand and political cohesion. As a result, out of
the original CPS outcomes for Pillar 1, two (Improved commercial use of the Sava river corridor
and Improved confidence in the financial statements of business entities, including SMEs, by
using accounting standards adapted to their size) were dropped and three revised. The two
outcomes were dropped because associated Bank programs were not pursued. Two new
outcomes were added to reflect the increased focus on business climate reforms. Of the ten
outcomes now included in Pillar 1, three have been fully or partially achieved and the remainder
are on track to achieve expected results by end-FY15. For Pillar II, the planned outcome of fiscal
savings equal to 1.8 percent of GDP through improved targeting of social and veteran benefits
was dropped because the programmatic Public Expenditure (PE) DPO series, which was the
cornerstone of this pillar, was terminated due to lack of commitment of the entity governments to
implement the reforms. The other three outcomes under this pillar are on track to achieve
expected results by end-FY15. For Pillar III, of the three outcomes, one has already been fully
achieved, while two are on track to be achieved by the end of the CPS period.
Pillar I – Competitiveness
35.
The Bank Group’s program was effective in enhancing competitiveness and
contributing to job creation. The program was anchored in analytical work on competitiveness
carried out during the previous CPS (see Annex 3). IDA investments in road infrastructure, in
partnership with EBRD and EIB, rehabilitated 220 km of roads and helped reduce user costs by
almost 18% in the FBiH and by 10.5% in the RS, which exceeded the target of 10%. IBRD
financing enhanced access to capital for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during the
financial crisis. The original loan of $70 million was fully disbursed in 2011 and 2012, and 110
SMEs received loans from participating commercial banks. It is estimated that these loans helped
sustain 4,000 jobs and create 1,120 new jobs. Additional IBRD financing of $120 million was
approved in response to the government’s request for continued intervention in improving access
to financing for SMEs. To complement the countercyclical IDA and IBRD crisis response, the
IFC invested $40 million to support capacity expansion and energy efficiency improvements of
the largest producer of glass, soda ash, and related chemicals in the country, and to support a
local company exporting precision tools for the automotive, electrical and ski industries.
36.
Efficient registration of real estate helped develop transparent land markets.
Property registration transactions, which used to take several months to complete, are now
completed in one day in larger urban centers thanks to the IDA-financed Land Registration
Project. The project also helped reduce the backlog of pending cases from 80,000 in 2006 to
18,200 in 2012.
37.
IFC focused on reducing costs and risks of doing business through improving the
business environment and investment climate. IFC is helping the BH authorities to adopt a
new and modern law on FDI that would simplify export-import procedures and is expected to
yield significant savings for businesses. IFC assisted local governments to simplify over 800
business related permits and licenses, resulting in over $40 million in private sector savings.
9

Going forward, IFC will continue to provide advisory services in the key areas related to
investment climate improvements. With financial support from a Swedish grant, IFC and IBRD
will jointly work to help with streamlining and reorganization of the inspection functions,
processes and legislation in accordance with EU requirements.
38.
The Bank demonstrated flexibility and restructured the Agriculture and Rural
Development project in response to an urgent need to assist farmers in flooded areas. That
assistance included provision of seedlings and greenhouses, as well as investments in rural
infrastructure. Competitiveness of the agriculture sector will be further improved through
investments in irrigation systems that will be financed by IDA. With IFC’s assistance, state level
institutions adopted the Food Labeling Rulebook, which is expected to facilitate local food
producers’ access to the EU market. Given that poverty in BH is primarily rural, these
interventions are expected to contribute to the government’s efforts to increase economic
opportunities for the poorest 40% of the population.
39.
In the infrastructure sectors, IFC’s objective is to increase private sector
participation by mobilizing private investments and the granting of long-term concessions.
IFC is the lead advisor helping the FBiH Government to attract private investments through a
public-private partnership (PPP) transaction for a 40 km section of the country’s 5c highway
corridor, part of the Pan-European transport corridor. The project is expected to attract EUR350
million worth of investment. Also, IFC supported entity governments in drafting 18 pieces of
legislation aimed at unlocking a renewable energy market worth EUR900 million (660 MW total
capacity); from among these, the governments have already adopted four critical laws.
40.
In the financial sector, IFC has signed a Trade Finance Line with a foreign bank, to
enhance its ability to provide export finance, thus contributing to export growth. IFC will
continue working with financial intermediaries to provide better access to finance for the private
sector, and especially for micro, small and medium enterprises. With IFC’s assistance, three
leading microfinance institutions were certified to adhere to the highest standards in client
protection in the microfinance industry (SMART campaign). IFC recently partnered with eight
municipalities to support debt counseling to over-indebted individuals or small businesses,
mainly clients of microcredit institutions.
Pillar II – Social Inclusion
41.
Guided by the Bank’s analytic work on poverty and social assistance,7 which was
reinforced by the conclusions of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) in
2012, the CPS greatly focused on enhancing the quality and efficiency of public spending.
Following the global financial crisis, in 2010 the Bank launched a programmatic Public
Expenditure DPO series. While DPO I ($111 million) was disbursed in 2010 after the authorities
successfully legislated reforms of cash transfers, the Bank dropped DPOs II and III as structural
reforms stalled in 2012, with entity governments stating that they no longer enjoyed the political
and social support needed to undertake the reforms. In contrast, businesses and governments in
both entities as well as the State government expressed support for investment climate reforms to
enhance growth and create jobs.

2009; and Protecting the Poor during the Global Crisis – Poverty Update – December 2009.

10

42.
As a result, the Bank shifted towards greater support for Pillar I activities through
business environment reforms, and scaled down the associated Pillar II lending. The Bank
Group initiated a new DPO to support post-crisis growth through improvements in the business
environment and investment climate. This growth-oriented reform program is deemed less
politically and socially controversial than the earlier fiscal consolidation reforms.
43.
Nevertheless, the Bank has maintained a policy dialogue with BH counterparts on
public spending and fiscal matters. Technical assistance on pensions and planned technical
assistance on public health financing stem directly from the PEIR recommendations. As a result,
the FBiH recently adopted a new pension strategy. In addition, through the debt management
technical assistance, the Bank is supporting prioritization and production of a coordinated plan of
action to strengthen debt management practices.
44.
The Social Safety Net and Employment Support Project has been effective in
extending job brokerage for vulnerable job seekers. The project achieved the objective of
extending job-brokerage services to 10,000 active job seekers among hard-to-employ categories
(disabled, long-term unemployed etc). Furthermore, policy dialogue contributed to adoption of
the new law on social protection in RS aimed at improvement of targeting of social benefits in
this entity. Finally, ongoing technical assistance on options to improve poverty targeting criteria
for social assistance programs will be incorporated in the new social assistance legislation which
is planned to be introduced in FBiH during 2014-2015. Social assistance targeting in RS is also
expected to benefit from incorporation of additional poverty indicators.
45.
IDA financing is proving effective in enhancing health system efficiency through
strengthening of primary health care along the family medicine model. Population coverage
through family medicine teams reached 1.25 million in FBiH and 1.03 million in RS, well on
track to meeting the targets of 1.5 million and 1.25 million respectively, or 70 percent coverage
of the population by the end of 2014. Given the demographic and epidemiological profile of the
population in BH these are critical elements to increase shared prosperity by improving the
health status of the population and contributing to reducing out-of-pocket expenditures on health.
Pillar III - Environmental Sustainability
46.
Bank support is helping to reduce pollution from municipal sources into the Neretva
and Bosna rivers and consequently the Adriatic Sea and Danube basins. Bank support
strengthened water management through already-completed rehabilitation of the waste water
treatment plants in four sites. Rehabilitation of a fifth plant is underway, while rehabilitation of
two more plants is expected to be completed during FY14-15. In partnership with the EU, IBRD
will significantly upgrade waste water infrastructure in Sarajevo, thus reducing pollution of the
Bosna River from the country’s biggest urban center.
47.
Coverage of protected forest and mountain areas has increased. The GEF Forest and
Mountain Protected Areas project expanded the protected area to 5.5 percent or 280,921 ha,
exceeding the goal of 3 percent or 140,000 ha coverage by the end of the project in FY14.
B.

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND PARTNERSHIPS

48.
After a strong performance of the Bank’s investment portfolio in FY12, continued
political stalemate negatively affected overall portfolio performance in FY13. The Bank’s active
portfolio currently consists of 12 investment operations with commitments totaling
11

$454.6 million (IDA – $184.1 million; IBRD – $250 million; GEF grants – $14.5 million). In
addition, the active recipient-executed trust fund portfolio amounts to $33 million. The period
FY10-FY12 saw a healthy portfolio and strong disbursement performance. However, FY13 was
marked by a slowdown of project implementation. The political situation delayed effectiveness
of recently-approved projects (Irrigation Development Project, Real Estate Registration, and
Additional Financing for Enhancing SME Access to Financing) which in turn impinged on
overall disbursement performance. Portfolio performance is expected to improve in FY14 as
recent restructurings start to bear results, and implementation of larger projects is accelerated.
The disbursement ratio for FY14 is currently projected to reach 22 percent. IFC’s portfolio
currently stands at $123.8 million, with 11 projects. Due to the complex political environment
and high country risk profile, new foreign and domestic investments remain limited.
49.
The Bank has developed strong collaboration with partners, in particular the
European Commission. Trust funds (TFs) are integrated with the Bank Group strategy and
complement projects in areas such as environment, transport and investment climate (see Annex
2). The EU approved a total of about $39 million of IPA resources, $19 million of which are
effective and under implementation, as co-financing or additional financing for five Banksupported investment projects in environment and transport. Three SIDA TFs totaling about
$13.7 million complement the Bank’s efforts in improving water management, agriculture and
rural development, as well as the investment climate. The Swiss Development Cooperation is the
key partner for the new program on risk factors awareness. USAID and UNDP have collaborated
in the preparation of the Energy Efficiency Project. Furthermore, the IMF has been a key partner
in structural reforms in the social sector, which were central to the IMF’s stabilization program.
C.

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CPS PROGRAM AND STRATEGY GOING FORWARD

50.
A flexible CPS has been essential given BH’s difficult political economy and
changing external environment. Flexibility has enhanced responsiveness to client demand,
facilitating program scale-up in relevant areas and allowing the Bank Group to strategically shift
support to areas most conducive to reform. In the wake of the Eurozone crisis, the Bank’s
additional support to enhance SMEs’ access to financing augured a strategic shift toward private
sector development. When political will to engage in sensitive public expenditure reforms
proved insufficient and the Bank cancelled the originally-envisaged Public Expenditure DPO
series ($200 million), the Bank Group responded flexibly by developing a new Business
Environment DPO ($50 million). Indeed, the main shift in the Bank Group strategy since its
inception has been to increase focus on Pillar 1 activities related to competitiveness and
improvements in the business environment, and concomitantly reduce lending associated
with fiscal reforms under Pillar 2. To respond to the flood emergency, support is being
prepared rapidly to enable the country to access resources through IDA’s Crisis Response
Window prior to BH’s graduation.8 In addition, the portfolio is being reviewed to identify
projects that can be restructured to redirect resources to flood response if needed.
51.
In response to changing client demand, most recently, the Bank cancelled the
proposed IDA credit for the Sava Waterway Rehabilitation Project after the governments
failed to reach agreement over institutional arrangements. The remaining IDA resources have

The proposed project would finance inter alia energy and power sector goods such as petroleum and fuel products
necessary for continuous operation of the thermal electricity generation plants.

12

been used for the Drina River Basin flood preparedness project, which was advanced into FY14.
All available IDA funds will be fully committed, reaching $187 million (including the
emergency project), by end-FY14. In addition, IBRD lending may reach $218 million upon
delivery of the new DPO in FY15 and a possible additional $48 million operation in FY15 (see
para. 50), consistent with the original planned CPS lending envelope. The original CPS Results
Matrix has been revised to reflect all past program adjustments as well as planned adjustments
for FY14 and FY15 (Annex 1).
52.
The Bank Group will continue to take a flexible approach, reflecting political
commitment for specific reform programs and the adjusted strategy for FY14-15; this
approach also allows for rapid response to the flood emergency. Access to IBRD resources
will be consistent with a strong and continued lending program after graduation from IDA that
will help Government maintain capital spending and pursue a limited structural reform agenda.

53.
In FY14 the CPS program has focused on delivering remaining IDA through the
Environmental Sustainability Pillar. IDA financing will support improvements in energy
efficiency and improvements of flood preparedness along the Drina River Basin. The Energy
Efficiency project (FY14 Q3) will demonstrate the benefits of energy efficiency improvements in
public sector buildings in the education and healthcare sectors and support the development of
scalable energy efficiency financing models. The Drina flood preparedness project will provide
increased protection from flood events to agricultural and commercial interests and communities
in project areas, increasing resilience to recurring floods and mitigating the catastrophic impact
of such floods, especially for the poorest. Finally, the GEF will also support two more projects in
FY14: Sustainable Forest Management - $5.6 million (FY14 Q3) and the proposed Adriatic Sea
Environmental Pollution Control - $2.44 million. A proposed $57 million IDA emergency flood
13

response operation is under preparation, to access IDA’s Crisis Response Window before BH’s
graduation at end-FY14. The ongoing needs assessment will inform the exact credit amount.
54.
The Bank Group will pursue a more comprehensive approach to competitiveness
and job creation in FY15, supporting a greater focus on shared prosperity. IBRD financing
will support business environment and investment climate reforms through the Business
Environment DPO, facilitating business start-up, streamlining investment procedures in
inspections and construction, and simplifying cross-border trading processes. Depending on the
outcome, a further $48 million of IBRD resources could be used, consistent with the CPS
objectives, to develop a more comprehensive approach to increasing competitiveness of the
economy, strengthening public finances (including public debt management) and enhancing job
creation. If the appetite for further reform in this area is weak, Bank support could be re-directed
toward priority investment projects such as reforming the health sector or improving the quality
of the road network. Political fragmentation and upcoming elections may prohibit the entities
from agreeing on a coherent reform program or identifying a priority investment operation to be
supported by IBRD resources. In that case, absorption of IBRD resources may fall below this
projection.
55.
The Joint IBRD/IFC Business Plan (JBP) for BH, prepared in early 2013, focuses on
the competitiveness pillar of the CPS while recognizing the complex and challenging
environment. The JBP focuses on policies and programs for SMEs as an area of high client
demand, shared WBG interest and often joint interventions. The JBP recognizes that BH has one
of the most unfavorable business environments in the region, along with complex government
structures, yet also desires to seek to create a single economic space. Progress has been
exceptional in the short time since the JBP’s preparation. Working hand-in-hand, combined
IBRD and IFC teams initiated the joint Business Environment DPO. IBRD led on the scope of
structural reforms and dialogue, while IFC provided technical advice in reform implementation
and country analytics, along with established stakeholder relations. Going forward, this joint
approach will continue to inform a more comprehensive approach to competitiveness and job
creation.
56.
The key medium-term development challenges in BH are likely to remain:
(i) improving the business environment and the overall competitiveness of the economy;
(ii) fostering social inclusion and increasing the pace of job creation; and (iii) maintaining
macroeconomic stability, including through strengthening of public financial management.
During the second half of the CPS cycle and in preparation for the new Country Partnership
Framework, the Bank will engage in policy dialogue with the authorities to ensure that the new
program remains firmly anchored in poverty reduction and shared prosperity, with a strong focus
on income growth and welfare of the poorest 40 percent of the population. This policy dialogue
will be underpinned by the findings of previous and forthcoming analytic and knowledge work
conducted by the Bank in BH and the Western Balkans.
57.
Analytic and knowledge services in the second half of the CPS period will provide
an important diagnostic foundation for preparing the upcoming FY16-19 Country
Partnership Framework (CPF) in alignment with the twin goals of eliminating extreme
poverty and enhancing shared prosperity. The Western Balkans Poverty Assessment provides
for regular monitoring of key poverty and inclusion indicators and statistical support and
capacity strengthening, and will address knowledge gaps on poverty and distributional issues,
particularly as they relate to Bank-supported reforms and projects. The Regional Activation and
Smart Safety Nets programmatic analytical work will provide technical support for labor force
14

participation and social safety net reforms. The Western Balkans Jobs Challenges is intended to
identify the main labor market incentives, determine policy priorities and discuss policies to
improve labor market outcomes. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
Assessment provided a systematic overview of the status of public financial management and
quantitative key budget performance indicators. This report represented a new platform for a
number of PFM policies and its findings can significantly advance the Bank’s and donor policy
dialogue in the country. Building on the extensive work on debt management at both the entity
and state levels, the Bank continues to support the authorities in improving debt monitoring and
strategy. Through the Western Balkans Regional Research & Development Strategy for
Innovation Technical Assistance the Bank will help Western Balkan countries, including BH, to
identify funding instruments for the implementation of their R&D action plans. The Western
Balkans Financial Sector Outlook will continue to provide a semi-annual analysis of key
vulnerabilities of the financial sectors in the region, together with recommendations to mitigate
them. Finally, the new regional Deep Dive: Turn Down the Heat will feature the Western
Balkans, and will help develop country-specific assessments and recommendations to help BH
better prepare itself for extreme climate and possible future natural hazards. Annex 3 summarizes
planned and actual delivery of analytic and knowledge services for the CPS period. For IFC
specifically, Bosnia and Herzegovina will remain on the list of Fragile and Conflict Affected
countries, and as such a priority country to support increased investment in selected sectors and
balanced advisory support. Special FCS approval protocol for investments up to $10 million has
been activated.

IV. RISKS

58.
General elections scheduled for October 2014 will further affect the environment for
reforms. The governments are unlikely to pursue substantial reforms as parties start positioning
for elections. Therefore there is a risk to the Bank Group program, particularly the proposed
DPO in FY15, should political instability increase and the country fail to meet all prior actions
and/or the IMF SBA targets. In this case the Bank will pursue investment lending in niche areas
where the government has a clear commitment to narrower sectoral reforms (see para. 50).
59.
Portfolio implementation risks will remain. The Bank’s program will continue to face
implementation obstacles as a result of complex political processes. This risk may be augmented
after the election due to possible delays in formation of the state and entity level executives.
While issues such as effectiveness delays are not completely within the Bank’s control, the Bank
will continue to work closely with project units and governments to mitigate this risk by
preparing procurement packages so that contracting can start immediately upon effectiveness.
The recent flood disaster may bring additional challenges to portfolio implementation as
government attention is diverted to address the impact of the floods; overall government capacity
may be further weakened. To help address this issue in the context of the flood support, the Bank
will work with existing Project Implementation Units that have demonstrated capacity and are
well-versed in Bank procedures. More generally, the Bank will continue to work closely with
project teams and counterparts and to provide training as needed. The Bank will also continue its
collaboration with key development partners, in particular EU institutions.

Entities working on establishing paying
systems to capture both IPARD and
Direct Payments. In 2012, 45% of the
agricultural payments in the RS were in
the form of structural investment
(IPARD like). In FBiH some 10 - 30%
of agricultural payments are made as
structural investments. In FBiH,
substantial progress has been made to
strengthen programing and develop
systems to coordinate with cantonal
structures to harmonize payments.

Description
The study assessed the main obstacles that require attention
if private sector-led growth is to become a significant
influence in the expansion of the BH economy.
The study analyzed the outcome of local services and found
that: i) access to and user satisfaction with services is low;
ii) municipalities lack resources and need to increase fiscal
space to expand access to services; iii) service providers lack
incentives to improve performance.
The policy note assessed what types of skills firms are
looking for and not finding in the marketplace. It found that
the shortage of skills sought by key export-oriented and
import competing industries is substantial and threatens to
constrain future economic growth of BH.
The policy note analyzed the level of spending on noninsurance social protection cash transfers, and the targeting
accuracy.
Provided an update on headcount poverty and found that
headcount poverty declined by 4% between 2004 and 2007.
The transport sector review provided an in-depth assessment
of the transport sector in BH and provided recommendations

ANNEX 4: GENDER GAPS IN BH

BH has made significant progress on gender equality issues, and the government has been
supportive in these efforts. The 2003 Law on Gender Equality required the government to
create a Gender Action Plan. Completed in 2006, the plan outlines strategies and program
objectives for achieving gender equality. Positive developments have included
“legislation on gender equality, the legal prohibition of gender-based violence and
harassment, and the institutionalization of gender mainstreaming in government offices,”
(ILO 2011).
Lack of recent microdata prevents an in-depth, updated analysis of gender issues in BH.
Nevertheless, a literature review of available sources has been conducted to inform this
CPSPR and suggests that important constraints to gender equality remain, most notably
in the areas of access to economic opportunities and agency. Upon availability of recent
microdata, a thorough gender assessment will be conducted to shed further light on
gender inequalities in the country.
Education. There are currently no significant gender gaps in primary and secondary
enrollment rates in BH, and women are more likely than men to enroll in tertiary
education (WDI 2011). However, a higher proportion of adult women than men still have
only primary education (ILO 2011). Similar to patterns in the region, segregation exists
in fields of study, affecting labor market outcomes and contribute to the gender
segregation seen there as well.
Health. BH has positive female health outcomes in many areas with gaps persisting in
others. Nearly all pregnant women receive antenatal care and have births attended by a
skilled attendant (UNICEF 2012), and maternal mortality is low (WDI 2010, 2011). Life
expectancy is comparable to the ECA average for both men and women (WDI 2011);
nevertheless, male adult mortality is nearly double female adult mortality (WDI 2010).
Access to economic opportunities. Some of the most significant gender gaps in BH are
in access to economic opportunities. Female and male labor force participation rates are
lower than the regional average in BH, at 42 percent and 68 percent, respectively, for
those aged 15 to 64 (WDI 2011). This gender gap, primarily driven by low female
activity, is larger than that in ECA and is in part determined by traditional gender roles
and insufficient child care facilities (WDI 2011, ILO 2011). For women who work, a lack
of data limits discussion of the wage gap, but in 2006 the UNDP estimated it to be 42
percent in the non-industrial production sector (2007). Further, only 33 percent of firms
have female participation in ownership, and only 14 percent have women in top
management despite a larger share of women than men in the labor market having
completed tertiary education (WDI 2009, 2009, 2011). Women’s property rights are
legally protected, yet tradition frequently favors male inheritance of property, and
ownership of property is traditionally registered to male family members.
Agency. Women in BH are less likely than men to occupy leadership positions. Women
hold 19 percent of the seats in Parliament, and only 12 percent of government ministers
31

between 2006 and 2011 were female (Inter-Parliamentary Union 2013, UNICEF 2012).
Data is not widely collected on violence against women, yet it is estimated that a third of
women are victims of domestic violence, and that few ever seek help from the police. At
the same time, sex trafficking is highlighted as a source for concern in the country,
particularly among vulnerable groups such as the Roma (U.S. Department of State 2012).
