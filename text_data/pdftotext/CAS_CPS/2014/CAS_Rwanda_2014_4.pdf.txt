REPUBLIC OF RWANDA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Rwanda’s progress has been rapid in recent years, building on a two-decade-long
turnaround which has been remarkable in both its pace and breadth. A highly strategic
approach to development has galvanized domestic and external resources around nationallydefined goals and delivered high rates of economic growth, a significant decline in poverty, a
reduction in inequality and progress in nearly all developmental outcomes. Rwanda has done
extremely well to reap the post-conflict dividend, and now it is time to focus on challenging
second-generation economic reforms of export diversification, structural transformation, regional
integration and financial sector deepening. Alongside this economic transformation, the
Government will need to boost the incomes of the poorest to maintain the gains in poverty
reduction and oversee the social and institutional transitions that come with rapid economic
change. This strategy sets out how the combined World Bank Group resources can best help
Rwanda achieve its poverty reduction and shared prosperity goals.
Poverty reduction and shared prosperity
2.
Efforts in reducing both poverty and inequality - from high starting points – have
been impressive. The poverty headcount dropped, with the share of population living below the
national poverty line falling from 59 percent in the early 2000s to 45 percent in 2011. In Kigali,
home to 10 percent of Rwanda’s population, the incidence of poverty decreased from 22.7
percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent in 2011. Starting from a much higher base, the rest of the country
experienced a 15 percentage point drop in poverty. The poverty gap ratio, which takes into
account the distance separating the poor from the poverty line, dropped by almost 10 percentage
points, from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2011. This implies that those who still live
below the poverty line are now closer to it than they were in 2001, which bodes well for future
poverty reduction. Inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, fell from 0.52 to 0.49.
3.
Though growth was strong throughout the last decade, it is only in the last five years
that there has been an effective translation into poverty reduction. The first half of the
decade (2001-2006) was characterized by high growth in Kigali and low, pro-rich growth in the
rest of the country, leading to an increase in inequality and modest poverty reduction. The
second half of the decade (2006-2011) experienced higher overall growth, mainly concentrated
in rural areas, and recorded an exceptionally strong growth rate for the poor, in particular the
extremely poor. The net result is a decade of strong growth and poverty reduction during which
welfare gains were realized at each point in the distribution and were relatively higher for the
poor. The agriculture sector has seen household-level agricultural production more than double
between 2001 and 2011, accounting for 35 percent of the national’s reduction in poverty.
Government’s Visions and Aspirations
4.
The Government’s medium term vision and targets are set out in a series of sectoral,
locality-specific and overarching strategic development plans. The medium term goals are set
out in the second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2), which
aims to accelerate private sector-led growth and further reduce poverty, including extreme
poverty. It seeks to do so while reducing aid-dependency and increasing self-reliance. The four
thematic areas are: (i) economic transformation, to achieve high and sustained growth and
restructure the economy towards services and industry, (ii) rural development, to bring the
national poverty rate below 30 percent, (iii) productivity and youth employment, to ensure
growth and transformation are supported by appropriate skills, and (iv) accountable governance,

to improve service delivery and increase citizen participation in and satisfaction with delivery of
development. These thematic areas are supported by eight foundational issues which are longterm ongoing priorities and seven cross-cutting issues1.
5.
The Government has set demanding targets across the four thematic areas. These
include targets for economic growth, reduction of poverty and extreme poverty, increases in the
installed electricity capacity, promotion of exports, shifts towards a more urbanized population,
enhancements in access to infrastructure, improvements in the quality of the labor force, creation
of jobs and SMEs and improved quality of public services. Though some targets are very
ambitious, the direction established by the results framework of the EDPRS 2 accords strongly
with Bank Group and IMF assessments of the priority challenges. Taken together, the targets
represent a highly ambitious agenda for inclusive growth over the coming years.
6.
Projections show that poverty targets, though demanding, are attainable – but only
if past patterns of growth in consumption and reduction in inequality are repeated in the
future. Growth alone is unlikely to reduce poverty sufficiently, and therefore a balanced
approach that emphasizes rapid growth for the lowest two quintiles of the population will be
crucial. While the vision for the future emphasizes the need for off-farm employment to be
created for an increasingly urbanized population, an anchor in agricultural productivity and rural
development will remain important to achieve this balance.
7.
Accelerating growth and creating jobs through the intensification and deepening of
the private sector lies at the heart of the development challenge and implies significant
action at policy and investment levels. The imperative for job creation is extremely strong; the
total non-farm labor force increased from 442,000 in 2001 to 1.4 million in 2011. About 100,000
formal and informal jobs are currently created per year, which is only half the annual growth
needed to maximize benefits from the demographic dividend.
8.
Despite the very strong performance with respect to the investment climate,
multiple challenges remain. The private sector is relatively small and weak, and geography,
low productivity and high energy costs make Rwanda expensive for enterprises dependent on sea
ports or energy-intensive processes. The domestic market is relatively limited and expanding
trade has been hampered by cross-border tensions and inefficiencies. Enterprise surveys—and
feedback from the private sector during the consultations for this CPS—confirm key challenges,
highlighting access to finance and availability of land as the most severe constraints, followed by
infrastructure (electricity and transport) and labor skills. Other issues relate to the arbitrary,
uncertain and unpredictable way in which certain areas of regulation are enforced.
Strategic options
9.
The resources of the WBG are modest relative to the financing needs of the EDPRS.
Selectivity in using IDA and close collaboration with IFC and MIGA are critical in delivering
the maximum impact with these limited funds. The CPS identifies a set of principles used in
defining future areas of engagement in Rwanda, comprising: i) alignment with the twin goals of
growth and poverty reduction; ii) comparative advantage relative to other donors; iii) opportunity
to maximise internal WBG synergies and present a coherent ‘one Bank Group’ approach; iv)
1

The foundational issue areas are macroeconomic stability, demographics, food security, basic education, primary health care,
rule of law, PFM, and decentralization; cross cutting issue areas are capacity building, environment, gender, regional integration,
HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), disaster management, and social inclusion.

ii

client demand; v) risk especially with respect to capacity constraints both on the side of
Government and the WBG. Based on this approach, the CPS identifies selected priorities for
WBG support within three main themes.
10.
The first theme has as its objective: ‘accelerating economic growth that is privatesector driven and job-creating’. This includes IDA investments and analytical work in energy
(to tackle high costs and low reliability which are major barriers to enterprise development) and
urban development (to enable the Government’s industrial strategy and also help reduce poverty
which is lower in urban areas). It envisages active investment by IFC in the financial sector,
supported by analytical work by both IFC and the World Bank. IFC also foresees direct
investments in the private sector by IFC, alongside potential MIGA guarantees. Both IFC and the
WB will engage in policy and analytical work in private sector development, leveraging of
public-private partnerships (PPPs) and investment climate work.
11.
The second theme is: ‘improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through
rural development and social protection’. With 80 percent of the labor force dependent on
agriculture, this sector is key to increasing incomes. This needs investments in agricultural
productivity (partly because of limited scope for expanding cultivable land area), nutrition (to
combat child malnutrition in rural areas), rural roads and IFC investments in horticulture,
agribusiness and microfinance. In social protection, IDA will support an expansion of Rwanda’s
social protection system, notably the flagship Vision Umurenge Program. Support will also help
strengthen core service delivery and the effective management and harmonization of Rwanda’s
social protection system. There will be additional investments for specific vulnerable groups (for
example, demobilized ex-combatants or victims of gender-based violence).
12.
The third theme comprises: ‘Supporting accountable governance through publicfinancial management and decentralization’. This supports the Government’s objective of
decentralising decision-making and making Government more open and participatory in its
processes. This will include likely IDA investment in PFM, fiscal decentralization, statistical
systems and open data. A team is currently considering the viability of a Program for Results
operation that would drive results in areas of public financial management, fiscal
decentralization, statistical capacity and open data.
13.
Working across these themes is the need to invest in and promote greater regional
integration. Rwanda’s size and location will mean that stronger integration with regional
economies will be vital for further growth. There are two elements to this. The first relates to the
need to expand markets for potential investors, to the need to turn “land-locked” into “landlinked” in the interests of competitiveness. Countries of the region represent potential markets
for exports, managers of transport corridors and facilitators of cross-border trade. As such
regional integration is as foundational to the future growth path as having a sound domestic
investment climate. Secondly, regional integration and cross-border investments will hopefully
bring with it greater political stability and security in the region.
14.
Rwanda has expressed its interest in a number of cross-border investments in the
Great Lakes region to make use of regional IDA resources. These include the financing of
hydropower generation on the borders with DRC and Burundi and improved transport
connections. IFC and MIGA stand ready to engage in such projects where a private sector role
exists (e.g., the Rusizi 3 Power Generation project). Some of IFC’s Rwanda-based clients
already serve both the domestic market and those of neighboring countries, particularly eastern
iii

DRC. Looking East, Rwanda has expressed interest in a number of projects that could provide
faster access to the sea or more reliable access to affordable energy.
Delivering for results
15.
IDA allocations for the CPS period remain indicative at this stage. The working
assumption is that allocations will be similar to those in the past, perhaps a little higher in
recognition of the improving CPIA score and the switch from a mix of grants and credits to
credits only. As such, IDA may commit approximately US$200-250 million a year during
IDA17, likely spread across three investment operations, two PforR operations and one series of
three DPOs. In addition, regional IDA should be leveraged for some priority investments.
16.
Budget support has been a highly effective instrument for the delivery of
predictable, flexible financing to a reform-minded government who spent the resources
well. But fluctuations in aid flows have to be managed carefully, and this CPS anticipates
different combinations of instruments that offer some flexibility in the financing that is delivered.
This CPS proposes less emphasis on development policy lending. The Government has requested
more of the IDA17 allocation in the form of program for results (PforR) operations. While the
previous CAS disbursed 66 percent in the form of budget support, this CPS is likely to disburse
the same proportion as a mix of PforR and Development Policy Operations.
17.
IFC has ten deals outstanding in Rwanda with committed volume of US$38 million.
They envisage that their investments will rise to US$120m by the end of the strategy period, the
bulk of which would be in the financial sector. IFC expects to engage in the financial sector
through a local currency credit line, a local currency bond issue and supporting the establishment
of a microfinance bank. In the infrastructure sector they have identified likely support to the
Rusizi III power generation project, Lake Kivu methane extraction projects and Kigali Bulk
Water Supply. With respect to manufacturing, IFC is considering investment for a mix-use
commercial building in Kigali. IFC’s Advisory Services portfolio has been highly valued and
regularly received acknowledgement for innovation and impact through the IFC awards schemes.
The Rwanda Entrepreneurship Development Program, the Rwanda Investment Climate Program
and the Efficient Security Markets Initiative (ESMID) have been particularly useful.
18.
MIGA currently has two active projects (KivuWatt and Bakhresa Grain Milling) in
Rwanda (total gross exposure of $110 million. MIGA is open for business across all of its
Political Risk Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of
Contract and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.
Managing Risks
19.
Risks to growth and poverty reduction arise from variable climatic conditions, and
the private sector response to government reforms. Stepping up measures to make agriculture
more climate-resilient, for instance through the construction of irrigation facilities and terracing
which the Bank is supporting, will be critical. Support for the private sector is targeted at taking
advantage of a better business environment. External risks relate to the pace of regional
integration and the potential for regional conflict, more-rapid-than expected tapering of
donor inflows, and a prolonged slump in the global economy. The CPS seeks to mitigate the
risks on the regional integration side through regional projects, the exposure to fluctuations in aid
flows through the choice of instruments and the aid dependence through measures to improve
domestic revenues.

I.

Introduction

1.
Rwanda’s progress has been rapid in recent years, building on a two-decade-long
turnaround, which has been remarkable in both its pace and breadth. This Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) is presented to the Board at a time when Rwanda commemorates the
twentieth anniversary of the Genocide against Tutsi. In Rwanda, it is a period of intense
reflection on the past successes and mistakes and, looking forward, of discussion and debate
regarding the future.
2.
A highly strategic approach to development, which has galvanized domestic and
external resources around nationally defined medium- and long-term goals, has delivered
economic growth, a significant decline in poverty, and a reduction in inequality (refer to
Box 1). Non-material measures of wellbeing have also improved, with impressive progress
across a sweep of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Of particular note is the progress in
advancing gender equality, including in complex areas of political empowerment – Rwanda now
has the most female representation in parliament in the world.
3.
While Rwanda has done extremely well to reap the post-conflict dividend, these
gains are largely exhausted. It is time to focus on challenging second-generation reforms of
export diversification, structural transformation, regional integration, and financial sector
deepening. Economic growth has been strong, but the Government recognizes that structural
transformation is needed to underpin the transition to middle-income status. A shift from the
current growth path, which is led by public investment dependent on high levels of donor
financing, to a growth path that has the private sector at the vanguard of growth, will be one of
the most fundamental elements of the transformation.
4.
Intensifying regional integration, looking both east and west, will ease some of the
bottlenecks that the economy faces. Looking to the Great Lakes region, the recently signed
Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework (PSCF) provides opportunities for shared
investments that could generate more reliable and affordable power, facilitate trade, and expand
markets for Rwanda’s exports. Looking to the East African Community (EAC), there are
opportunities for infrastructure investments that make transport corridors more functional and
power imports more affordable, so reducing costs for businesses investing in Rwanda and
improving competitiveness.
5.
A medium-sized client of the World Bank Group (WBG), Rwanda has regularly
been presented as a success story for the rewards of efficient donor harmonization and
budget support. Over the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) period, 66 percent of the
World Bank commitments were in the form of budget support, reflecting the balance of aid
modalities adopted also by other multilateral and bilateral donors. By all accounts, evidence
suggests this is a country where development assistance has had a positive, sustainable impact.
6.
Recent delays in delivering financing through budget support have exposed the
vulnerabilities associated with delivering aid through these mechanisms. The choice and
balance of financing instruments is under re-consideration by many donors — in particular a
move away from “general” budget support — and donor coordination mechanisms are being redrawn as a result. Both donors and the Government remain committed to finding a mechanism
that provides space for efficient and effective dialogue on issues of developmental importance.
Reducing dependence on donor assistance and expansion of the currently narrow, undiversified

export base will be important to minimize the vulnerability of growth to fluctuations in foreign
exchange revenues.
Box 1: Delivering development: how has Rwanda done it?
Rwanda’s performance since the Genocide twenty years ago has been remarkable in terms of social and economic
outcomes. How have they done this and can others learn from the experience? Some important factors include the
following:









An imperative to re-build from the worst possible situation, innovating where necessary. At one level,
there was no alternative but to deliver. The country had been devastated in every aspect and the new
Government quickly realized the importance of reviving and restoring confidence in the economy and the
fabric of society. During this period, much was achieved through a combination of innovative institutional
delivery and participatory community-based approaches that rebuilt the collective spirit of Rwandans.
A clear vision, motivated by challenging objectives, supported with resources which do not leak. A series
of strategies and plans developed over the last twenty years have consistently targeted poverty reduction and
social and human development outcomes. The attack on corruption and improvements in public financial
management (for example, the introduction of a meaningful MTEF) meant that public resources were spent on
achieving the vision. Clarity on the end goals has been an important unifying force across Government at
different levels and across executive and administrative branches. The development of strong statistical
systems has allowed progress to be monitored, adjustments to be made and accountability to be enforced.
Contracts for results that cascade through the system and high standards of government effectiveness.
The drive for results has very strong support and leadership from the highest levels in Government. The
President’s Office and the Prime Minister’s Office have driven the culture of performance. They track progress
made towards EDPRS goals to hold government staff accountable for achieving results through the agreement
of performance contracts (the imihigo), which specifies the results to be delivered over the coming year and are
now formalized around strategic indicators and targets linked to the EDPRS and MDGs. Rwanda uses
incentives such as national pride in combination with consequences for insufficient performance (loss of job
for example) to motivate officials. The Annual National Leadership Retreat provides official reporting in front
of peers and the President himself on performance against EDPRS goals and retreat-specific actions from the
previous year2. This has proven very effective in achieving results. Through the National Dialogue Council
“Umushyikirano” coordinated by the Prime Minister and Chaired by the President, citizens debate issues
relating to the state of the nation, the state of local government and national unity.
A desire for learning and a cycle of experimenting, measuring, learning, adapting that generates
powerfully productive home-grown solutions: Beginning with simple budget monitoring and expanding
into a more sophisticated monitoring system, processes have been developed over time that inform the
accountability relationships between the top level of government, line ministries and districts. These are
formalized with established monthly, quarterly, and annual reports between groups to measure progress
towards the EDPRS targets. As part of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the
Government of Rwanda drew on aspects of Rwandan culture and traditional practices to enrich and adapt its
development programs to the country’s needs and context. The result is a set of home-grown, culturallycustomised solutions (e.g. Gacaca, Umushyikirano, etc) which have translated into sustainable mechanisms for
addressing Rwanda’s social and economic development challenges.

7.
The Government’s national strategies are highly ambitious. It is seeking an exit from
low-income status by 2020, a reduction of the nationally estimated extreme poverty rate to 9
percent by 2017, and GDP growth rates of 10.2 percent per annum (11.5 percent by 2020). The
sectoral targets that cascade from these goals are no less challenging. The collection of goals and
targets defined by Government across the broad range of national and sectoral strategy provides
a strong sense of alignment with WBG corporate goals for extreme poverty reduction and shared
prosperity and represent a strong framework to which the WBG can align.
2

These retreat-specific actions are generally associated with problem areas in achieving the EDPRS or MDG goals and
identification of strategies to overcome them.

8.
Acknowledging the progress to date, the prospects and visions for the future, and
the emerging development challenges, this CPS highlights the role for the WBG in
supporting the achievement of national objectives and WBG corporate goals. The CPS has
been prepared jointly by a team from IDA, IFC and MIGA and represents a shared view of how
resources across the whole WBG can best be leveraged. It draws on considerable background
analytical work, which is partially summarized in Annex 3. Mirroring the timeframes of the
Government’s own strategies, this CPS is presented as a five-year strategy that has room for midterm adjustment to ensure continued relevance. It reflects input from in-country consultations
with Government partners (including representation of local government), the private sector,
development partners, civil society, and academia.

Rwanda’s Progress and Prospects

Economic developments and challenges

9.
Strong policies have helped Rwanda achieve outstanding economic progress from a
low starting point. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies geared towards maintaining
macroeconomic stability, coupled with an emphasis on building institutional capacity, on
promoting good governance, and on creating a business-friendly environment, contributed to low
inflation and average annual economic growth in excess of 8 percent over the last decade. From
a regional perspective, Rwanda’s macroeconomic performance has generally outperformed its
peers and earned the country a spot on the list of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world.
Public debt remained modest and reserve buffers kept the economy resilient to macroeconomic
shocks.
10.
The World Bank and IMF share the positive assessment that Rwanda’s
macroeconomic policy framework is adequate and macroeconomic management is
effective. Quick and appropriate fiscal and monetary responses to the global financial crisis in
2009 and to the short-term aid shortfall in mid-2012/early 2013 3 illustrate the capacity for
effective management of macro shocks. Rwanda has been under IMF programs since early 2000s
including two Poverty Reduction and Growth Facilities (PRGFs) in 2000s. The IMF successfully
concluded the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) at the end of 2013 and embarked on a new PSI
program for another 3 years. The new PSI represents a continuation of the authorities’ prudent
approach to macroeconomic policy. The fiscal framework aims to mobilize domestic revenues
and adjust spending to available resources, while protecting priority spending and minimizing
domestic financing to leave ample space for private sector growth. On the monetary side, the
BNR remains committed to low inflation and financial sector stability and is building its capacity
to achieve these objectives
Real Sector Developments
11.
Rapid growth over the past decade has seen GNI per capita rise dramatically from
US$185 to US$6204. The economy is dominated by the services sector, which accounted for 45
percent in 2013, followed by the agriculture sector (33 percent) and the industry sector (15

The aid shortfall created a fiscal gap amounting US$230 million (equivalent to 3 percent of GDP) in the first half of
FY2012/13, although more than half US$140 million was disbursed in the second half.

percent) 5 . The volume of Official Development Assistance (ODA) increased from US$360
million in 2002 to US$0.9 billion in 2012 (13 percent of GNI) and these substantial inflows of
foreign aid have stimulated the services sector through Government expenditures. The services
sector, most notably trade, transportation and communications, contributed to more than half of
the increase in GDP between 2008 and 2013.
12.
The aid shortfall and resulting delays in budget expenditures in the second half of
2012 resulted in lower credit growth to the private sector and contributed to a deceleration
in growth during 2013. Real growth decelerated from 7.3 percent in 2012 to 4.6 percent in
2013, while growth in the services sector slowed from 10.8 percent in 2012 to 3.6 percent in
2013.
External Sector
13.
Rwanda’s balance of payments is characterized by negative current account and
positive overall balance (at 1.5 percent of GDP), as large trade deficits in the current
account are offset by grant aid inflows. This positive overall balance of payments has enabled
Rwanda to increase the level of foreign reserves from US$142 million in 2002 to US$1.1 billion
in 2013. As aid flows faltered in the second half of 2012, the current account deficit increased
from 7.2 percent in 2011 to 11.4 percent of GDP before settling again at around 7 percent in
2013.
14.
Exports have expanded by 40 percent since 2012, mostly driven by an increase in
major export products such as coffee and minerals. This increase in exports combined with a
slow growth in imports has resulted in an export to import ratio of 54 percent. The resumption
of aid in the first half of 2013 (including budget support operations totaling US$140 million) and
the issuance of Eurobonds amounting to US$400 million in April 2013 have also contributed to
the recovery of the external position.
15.
In general, the last decade saw a steady strengthening in the export sector; exports
of goods increased by 24 percent on an annual basis and reliance on traditional exports
(coffee, tea and minerals) fell from over 90 percent to 70 percent. Tourism is now the largest
export item in Rwanda. Though still just below 5 percent of total exports, the share of
manufactured products in the export basket tripled in dollar value between 2007 and 2011 with a
particular increase in light manufactured products (milled products, hides and skins, and
beverages). Re-exports are also beginning to play a more prominent role in Rwanda’s export
basket, including petroleum products and vehicles.
Inflation, Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
16.
Rwanda’s monetary and exchange rate policy framework is consistent with
macroeconomic stability and growth targets. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has
strengthened the liquidity management framework to enhance the effectiveness of monetary
policy and improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The BNR recently introduced
a more flexible monetary targeting framework by introducing a reserve money band of ±2
percent around the central reserve money target. In the wake of the aid shortfall, the BNR kept
its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 7.5 percent between May 2012 and mid-June 2013 to
anchor inflation expectations from substantial Government borrowing on the domestic market.
5

The remaining share (6 percent) is due to adjustment items.

4

Inflation rates have been stable and reasonable in recent years. In 2013 inflation fell to 4.2
percent from 6.3 percent in 2012.
17.
Exchange rate policies have permitted greater exchange rate flexibility since the
introduction of an exchange rate corridor framework in March 2010. The exchange rate
regime is classified as de facto crawl-like and de jure floating. The BNR started to use a marketbased exchange rate calculated as a weighted average of foreign exchange interbank rates and
intervention transactions rate in December 2010. In 2012, the overall foreign exchange risk
exposure for banks was set at ±10 percent of their core capital in line with practice in most of
East African Community (EAC) countries.
18.
The financial sector remained stable until the first half of 2013, and appears fairly
resilient to shocks. As of June 2013, the capital adequacy ratio (total capital to risk weighted
assets) of the banking sector remained stable at 23.1 percent, well above the 15 percent minimum
stipulated by the regulations.
Fiscal Policies and Developments
19.
Fiscal policy is consistent with a macro framework that is focused on maintaining
stability while promoting economic growth. The composition of public expenditure is wellaligned to the national goals of growth acceleration and poverty reduction identified in the
second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2). The medium-term
fiscal policy framework aims towards fiscal consolidation through increased revenue
mobilization and expenditure prioritization, including infrastructure projects. Actual budget
expenditures remain above 90 percent of planned expenditures. Information on the budget and its
execution is open to the public. The website of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MINECOFIN) includes information on Budget Execution Report for the FY2012/13 as well as
the 2013/14 Approved Budget.6
20.
At 29 percent of GDP, Government expenditures represent a large share in the
economy and are underpinned by development assistance. Tax revenues have increased, from
a low base, by more than 2 percent of GDP in the past decade to reach 14 percent in FY2012/13.
The introduction of a new Value-Added Tax Law and improvements in taxpayer services such as
electronic filling and payments have helped in this regard. Aid accounted for between 40-50
percent of the total revenues over the last decade, and when it fluctuates the Government has
taken appropriate measures to protect non-discretionary spending such as wages and social
expenditures and maintain a prudent fiscal position.
B.

Macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability

21.
Bank staff estimates that Rwanda’s economy will grow at 6 percent in 2014, as the
impact of the resumed aid inflows and resulting government expenditures filters through.
The inflation rate is projected to remain moderate, though poor recent harvests will possibly
generate some inflationary pressure.
22.
Rwanda’s risk of debt distress rating has improved from moderate to low in the
latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) in response to a broadened export base. The total
public debt outstanding at the end of 2013 stood at 21.5 percent of GDP and the DSA shows that
6

http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/index.php?id=2

5

Rwanda’s external debt remains below the indicative thresholds under all scenarios examined.
The DSA further acknowledges that the authorities have made progress on enhancing their debt
management capacity. A major development was the preparation and presentation by the
authorities of their own DSA in October 20127.
23.
Balance of payments vulnerability is expected to decline in the medium term, but in
the near term the current account balance will depend on aid inflows. The current account
is expected to remain in deficit over the medium term, but deficits are expected to narrow as
some of the large strategic investment projects come to completion and exports continue to grow.
While exports are vulnerable to fluctuations in international commodity prices, the Government
expects that the implementation of the recently approved National Export Strategy, which
provides a framework for increasing exports, will yield early results in terms of the
diversification of exports. To finance the current account deficit, foreign direct investment (FDI)
is expected to increase from 2.2 percent in 2012 to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2018. International
reserves are projected to exceed 4 months of imports after 2015.
24.
The IMF’s new 3 year PSI is optimistic on fiscal sustainability issues, projecting the
state budget to significantly improve in the medium-term. Under these projections, the
domestic revenues to GDP ratio will increase from 16 percent in 2012/13 to 19.2 percent in
2017/18, while the grants to GDP ratio will decrease from 7.9 percent to 5.4 percent during the
same period. As such, the share of grants in the revenues will decrease from 33 percent in
2012/13 to 22 percent in 2017/18, indicating reduced aid dependency.

Poverty reduction and social development

25.
A strong focus on homegrown policies and initiatives contributed to a significant
improvement in access to services and in human development indicators. Analysis from the
Bank’s Rwanda Economic Update shows how the considerable inflows of foreign aid have been
effectively used in support of socio-economic development. The strong growth was accompanied
by substantial improvements in living standards, evidenced by a two-thirds drop in child
mortality and the attainment of near-universal primary school enrolment. There has been
impressive progress towards meeting the MDGs (Annex 4).
26.
Particularly notable have been the efforts in reducing both poverty and inequality
from high starting points. The poverty headcount dropped, with the share of population living
below the national poverty line falling from 59 percent in the early 2000s to 45 percent in 2011.
In Kigali, home to 10 percent of Rwanda’s population, the incidence of poverty decreased by six
percentage points, from 22.7 percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent in 2011. Starting from a much
higher base, the rest of the country experienced a 15 percentage point drop in poverty. The
poverty gap ratio, which takes into account the distance separating the poor from the poverty
line, dropped by almost 10 percentage points, from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2011.
This implies that those who still live below the poverty line are now closer to it than they were in
2001, which bodes well for future poverty reduction. Inequality, as measured by the Gini
coefficient, reduced from 0.52 to 0.49. Annex 3 provides a more elaborate analysis.
27.
There is much to learn from the past growth path regarding the effective
transmission of growth into poverty reduction. Though growth was strong throughout the last
decade, it is only in the last five years that there has been an effective translation into poverty
reduction. Growth incidence curves (Figure 1 and Figure 2) show how different the growth
patterns were in the first and second halves of the decade with respect to their capacity to reduce
poverty. The different poverty performance between the first and second halves of the decade
can largely be explained by differences in the magnitude and nature of growth. The first half of
the decade (2001-2006) was characterized by high growth in Kigali and low, pro-rich growth in
the rest of the country, leading to an increase in inequality and modest poverty reduction. The
second half of the decade (2006-2011) experienced higher overall growth, mainly concentrated
in rural areas, and recorded an exceptionally strong growth rate for the poor, in particular the
extremely poor. The net result is a decade of strong growth and poverty reduction during which
welfare gains were realized at each point in the distribution and were relatively higher for the
poor.

28.
Poverty reduction over the past decade has mainly been driven by improvements in
agriculture and rural development. Household-level agricultural production more than
doubled between 2001 and 2011, accounting for 35 percent of the reduction in poverty (Figure
3). Households also produced progressively for the market, witnessed by an increase of the share
of the harvest sold from 13 percent in 2001 to 21 percent in 2011. This increased
commercialization of agricultural activity accounts for a further 10 percent of the reduction in
poverty. At the same time, households have reduced risk by diversifying in non-farm income
activities. The fraction of households with an occupation outside agriculture more than doubled
from 30 percent in 2001 to 70 percent 10 years later. This progressive move towards selfemployment in small nonfarm businesses has particularly been important, explaining 13 percent
of the overall reduction in poverty. The sharp drop in fertility observed over the past five years
has led to smaller families and decreased dependency ratios, increasing household disposable
income.

29.
Can these rates of poverty reduction continue or even be accelerated over the next
five years and more? Many of the poor are now clustered just below the poverty line, meaning
that a small increase in consumption can push these households over the threshold (Figure 4).
This bodes well for the future pace of poverty reduction as the “bulge” approaches and crosses
the line. Equally important, the share of poor households located far below the poverty line (with
consumption expenditures of less than half the poverty line) has decreased by substantially from
38 percent in 2001 to 22 percent in 2011. Although much remains to be done, this means that the
poorest of the poor are sharing the benefits of growth.

Governance and Institutions

30.
Rwanda has achieved remarkable progress in rebuilding the core institutions of the
state over the last two decades. It has established a political settlement and maintained national
security since the Genocide in a very difficult environment. Such a fast progression to peace and
security from violence is in stark contrast with many conflict affected countries, which often
grapple for some time with the challenge of establishing their legitimacy and authority across
their territorial boundaries and protecting citizens’ basic security. Evidence suggests a high level
of personal security; the homicide rate stands at 5.1 per 100,000 (2009 data) and United Nation
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) data indicate that Rwanda’s rate is significantly lower
9

than for neighboring countries. At the same time, Rwanda scores well on indicators of
government effectiveness and control of corruption (see Figure 5), including in a comparative
sense in terms of other countries in the region.

31.
As part of its development vision, the top leadership has pursued vigorously a zero
tolerance approach to corruption, which has been fundamental to the strong growth and
service delivery performance recorded over the past decade. Transparency International has
ranked Rwanda as the least corrupt country in the East Africa Community (EAC) and among the
least corrupt in Africa, a trend also consistently reflected in the Mo Ibrahim Index for the last 10
years. A raft of oversight institutions has been established to control corruption and promote
integrity and there is a constitutionally upheld asset declaration process for public officials,
although this is not public. Legal and administrative sanctions are imposed to ensure
performance and discipline in the system, with several senior officials tried in the courts in recent
years and police officers dismissed for soliciting bribes.
32.
The Government has also taken the approach that to deliver results it must drive
forward radical and ambitious public sector reform. It radically restructured the
administration early on in the recovery phase in 1998-1999 through a large-scale downsizing
with over 6,000 civil servants being dismissed because they were not qualified and over 6,500
being removed from the payroll as ‘ghost workers’. Salaries to the much smaller number of staff
were increased by 40 percent to eliminate the incentive for supplementing income through petty
corruption. From 2000 in tandem with significant fiscal, political and administrative
decentralization reforms, central Government ministries were unbundled to create flatter and
considerably downsized structures and bring service delivery closer to the grassroots for
enhanced performance and accountability.
33.
Rwanda’s public administration nevertheless still faces a number of significant
institutional capacity challenges that will affect long term resilience and overall governance
capacity if left unaddressed. The skills deficit is still significant and many of the new
institutions lack the right staff and coordination mechanisms. The incentives for attraction,
promotion and retention of staff require improvement to counter the high (by regional standards)
vacancy and turnover rates.
10

34.
Rwanda scores much lower on voice and accountability governance indicators than
on other aspects of governance. For example the Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without
Borders ranks Rwanda 156 out of 178 countries for 2012 and Freedom House ranks Rwanda 178
out of 197 countries in its 2012 World Press Freedom Index. The IREX Media Sustainability
Index indicates a downward trend since 2008. The constitution upholds a free press and a
number of private radio stations operate in Rwanda, while a set of new laws are making their
way through Parliament to take forward a process of media reform including moving towards
self-regulation, which allows journalists to determine what to publish without outside
interference. However, international human rights organizations have expressed concern over
restrictions on journalists and civil society. National civil society advocacy is relatively
underdeveloped in Rwanda, perhaps as a corollary to the firm Government presence.
35.
In regard to the horizontal checks and balances on the exercise of executive power,
Rwanda’s constitution provides for a robust, autonomous legislative role. For example, the
legislature can override the President’s objections to ordinary laws with a two-thirds majority,
and the majority of deputies in the Lower Chamber of Deputies are elected by universal suffrage
while a certain number have to be women (the upper house, the Senate is composed of indirectly
elected members and some presidentially appointed members). A Public Accounts Committee
was recently established to improve financial oversight and standing committees are playing a
growing role. Nevertheless, Parliament remains a new institution that is still building its capacity
and potential to act as a channel for national debate on constituent and party concerns. Its
oversight role is strongly determined by the nature of political and civil society.
36.
From a barely functional judiciary in 1994, progress in capacity building has been
considerable. Recent improvements in the formal justice system include an increased presence
of defense lawyers at trials, improved training for court staff, enhanced oversight by an
inspectorate office in the Supreme Court, and revisions to the legal code. By the end of 2008
there were 266 judges of which 36 percent were women. Bar association membership exceeds
850 advocates (having started with 37 in 1997). A high backlog of cases in ordinary courts has
been an ongoing challenge for Rwanda’s justice system. For example in 2007 there were 54,409
backlogged cases against 31,126 tried. In addition justice has been decentralized and made more
accessible through the Abunzi mediators at the lowest local Government ‘cell’ level.
Nevertheless, in terms of fulfilling its potential as an oversight institution, according to Freedom
House’s 2010 report on Rwanda, the judiciary has yet to secure full independence from the
executive.
E.

Sustainability

Protecting the Environment
37.
The combination of Rwanda’s size, topography, population density, and natural
resource base suggest that the projected rapid growth rates may present risks for
environmental sustainability. Though direct investment by the WBG in the environment
sectors is likely to be limited,8 the WBG can play a significant role in promoting sustainability
along the rapid growth path envisaged in national strategies. A study has been undertaken to
explore some of the “big picture” trade-offs that might occur between the pursuit of rapid growth
8

The Government has support from other primary development partners in this sector and is unlikely to request IDA resources
for this sector.

11

and the imperative for environmental sustainability and sound natural resource management over
coming years. It will also explore where resource constraints or negative externalities could
potentially hinder growth in key sectors and highlight how we can mainstream climate resilience
and environmental sustainability though our sector operations.
38.
Changes associated with rapid growth paths are likely to have some consequences
for natural resources and the environment. Sustaining growth of even 7.5 percent per annum
implies changes in terms of how land and other natural resources are used. There might be
negative pressures on the environment (for example, through increased pollution) or reduced
pressures (for example, through efficiency gains, reduced pressure on wood for fuel and through
fertility decline). The study undertaken alerts the WBG to the potential implications of the
growth path and possible ways that mitigations and sustainability can be built into the sector
operations that we will be supporting. Annex 6 provides a preliminary overview of the findings
of a rapid environmental review.
39.
Based on the WBG’s ongoing engagements, the CPIA and other sources, however, it
is clear that the Government of Rwanda takes environmental challenges seriously. The
Government has already developed environmental, climate change and green growth strategies
and action plans and is initiating associated reforms and improvements in procedures and
practices. Ensuring a “Green Economy” is an explicit part of the growth pillar of the EDPRS 2.
A new National Climate and Environment Fund (FONERWA) is being set up to facilitate the
mainstreaming of climate change and environment activities, and guidelines have been
developed on adaptation for several key sectors. A significant knowledge base is being
developed. An environment and climate change atlas has been published in 2011 and another
being drafted on ecosystems and climate. These strategies and information base, built on an
existing environmental legal/regulatory system, will be important tools to guide proposed WBG
sectoral investments in a direction that promotes growth while ensuring environmental
sustainability.

III.

Government’s Vision and Aspirations

40.
Rwanda’s purposeful and practical approach to setting and robustly pursuing a
national vision and then aligning resources to it is arguably one of the most distinctive in
Africa. The vision and targets are set out in a series of sectoral, locality-specific, and
overarching strategic development plans. The clearest aggregation of medium-term goals is set
out in the second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2). The
elaboration of the EDPRS 2 involved extensive discussions and consultations with the Rwandan
population, including youth, private sector, civil society, and academia. A communications
strategy was tailored to solicit feedback and ideas from citizens from every socioeconomic
category.9 To ensure the broadest possible participation, two Umuganda days (the last Saturday
of each month when all citizens engage in community work) were used to solicit citizens’ views
and contributions to the EDPRS 2.
41.
The overall objectives of the EDPRS 2 are to accelerate private sector-led growth
and further reduce poverty, including extreme poverty. It seeks to meet these objectives
9

Communications included a customized EDPRS 2 website, a toll-free SMS line, focus group discussions and country-wide road
shows with brochures, banners, billboards and radio and TV coverage.

12

while reducing aid-dependency and thus increasing self-reliance by focusing on 4 thematic areas:
(a) economic transformation to achieve high and sustained growth and restructure the economy
toward services and industry, (b) rural development to bring the national poverty rate below 30
percent, (c) productivity and youth employment to ensure growth and transformation are
supported by appropriate skills, and (d) accountable governance, to improve service delivery and
increase citizen participation in and satisfaction with delivery of development. These thematic
areas are supported by 8 foundational issues,10 which are long-term, ongoing priorities for which
substantial progress was already achieved during EDPRS 1 and 7 cross-cutting issues.11
42.
The Government has set demanding targets across the four thematic areas. These
include targets for economic growth, reduction of poverty and extreme poverty, increases in the
installed electricity capacity, promotion of exports, shifts towards a more urbanized population,
enhancements in access to infrastructure, improvements in the quality of the labor force, creation
of jobs and SMEs, and improvements in the quality of public services. Though some targets may
not be achieved in absolute levels, the sense of direction established by the results framework of
the EDPRS 2 accords strongly with WBG and IMF assessments of the challenges that need to be
tackled over the coming period. The approach sets a robust framework that has guided the CPS
and results framework.
43.
Strategies and strategic targets are taken seriously in Rwanda, with mechanisms
established to convert medium-term goals into annual plans, budgets, and specific
performance contracts that hold ministers and their teams accountable for delivery. The
top government leadership takes measures to ensure clear delivery targets and monitoring
processes for national strategies. These strategies and targets are effectively communicated to all
levels of government, as well as to non-state players and external partners. An annual National
Leadership Retreat convenes the entire government to review progress and set clear priorities
and targets for the year ahead (refer to Box 1).
44.
Taken together, the targets set in the EDPRS2 represent a highly ambitious agenda
for inclusive growth over the coming years. In order to achieve middle-income status by 2020,
Rwanda must achieve a targeted average annual real GDP growth of 11.5 percent between 2012
and 2020. Attainment of the target would require a significant acceleration from the already high
growth rates in the last decade. As such, for modeling purposes the WBG and the IMF are using
forecasted rates more in line with past trends (as used for example in their Debt Sustainability
Analysis and the recent Joint Staff Advisory Note). Together the IMF and the World Bank
identify two key challenges to attaining the growth target: (a) the funding and implementation of
public and private investment in view of prospects for declining—at least in relative terms—
official external financing; and (b) the sustainability of planned policies in light of the
compression of public and private consumption that would be consistent with a re-allocation of
public and private resources into investment.
45.
The EDPRS 2 looks to the private sector to drive growth and job creation over the
medium term. Over the past five years, improvements in the investment climate have not
unlocked the desired significant increase in private investment. The private sector development
10

The foundational issue areas are macroeconomic stability, demographics, food security, basic education, primary health care,
rule of law, PFM, and decentralization.
11
The cross-cutting areas are capacity building, environment, gender, regional integration, HIV/AIDS and non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), disaster management, and social inclusion.

13

strategy acknowledges the challenges involved. The economic transformation theme of the
EDPRS 2 aims to drive down the cost of doing business by removing key bottlenecks in
infrastructure and energy. While the EDPRS 2 defines the role of the public sector as a catalyst
for private sector-led growth, performing this role will require significant financing, including
leveraging public-private partnerships (PPPs) where feasible. This suggests a delicate task for
Government in prioritizing its investment programs while taking into account proper sequencing
and linkages between them, as well as to ensure that adequate financing is available to support
private investment.
46.
Meeting export targets will require accelerated regional integration and
diversification of both products and markets. The East African Community countries are at
the final stage of adopting an EAC Monetary Union Protocol, which will set macroeconomic
convergence criteria, among others, as a precondition for accession to the single currency area. It
will also establish a transition period toward the single currency area, during which countries
will align their economies to the set criteria and adjust their policies accordingly. The
Government, already appreciating some benefits from greater regional integration since entering
the common market in 2009, actively pursues implementation of the protocol. Results of a recent
“scorecard” show significant achievements so far.
47.
Reproduction of past growth rates alone will not be enough to reach poverty
reduction targets – a reproduction of past reductions in inequality is also needed. Figure 6
shows the combinations of household consumption growth (horizontal axis) and inequality
reduction (vertical axis) that are needed to achieve the poverty target (steeper curve) and extreme
poverty target (gentler slope) by the end of the second EDPRS 2 in 2018.12 In the absence of
redistribution (no reduction in inequality) household consumption will need to grow by 3.6
percent per year between 2011 and 2018 to reduce poverty to their target level of 30 percent.
This is higher than both the growth in consumption observed over the past decade (2.5 percent)
and the growth observed between 2006 and 2011 (3 percent). However, if inequality could be
reduced at an average rate of 1 percent per year (the annual rate of inequality decline between
2006 and 2011), the poverty target would be attained with consumption growth of less than 2.3
percent. Annex 3 provides a fuller analysis.

12

These simulations are based on the poverty curves developed by Ferreira and Leite (2003). The simulations are purely
mechanical and we present them for illustrative purposes. They should be interpreted with caution.

Shaping the Post-2015 agenda, the WBG Development Committee has endorsed the
global goal of eradicating extreme poverty within a generation. This targets reducing the
proportion of people living below the international poverty line of US$1.25 per day to no more
than 3 percent by 2030. Not all countries can be expected to meet this goal, and so it is not a
“binding” target in that sense for Rwanda. But still it is illustrative to at least consider—what will
it take for Rwanda to seek to meet the ambitious global goal? Using poverty lines based on
national datasets rather than the international poverty line (US$1.25 per day), projections (see
figure 7) suggest a similar combination of growth in household consumption and inequality
reduction will be needed to meet national targets. It will take a reproduction of past rates of
growth and inequality reduction in order to meet these global international goals in Rwanda.

49.
Clearly progress on inequality reduction – not just growth - will determine to a
large extent whether Rwanda will meet the poverty targets of the Second EDPRS. While the
poverty targets in the EDPRS 2 are ambitious, they can realistically be attained if Rwanda keeps
up its strong shared growth performance of the past 6 years. This suggests that investments that
actively seek to raise the productivity and incomes of the lowest groups will be needed to
approach this target. Emphasis within the EDPRS 2 on scaling up social protection and
15

intensifying the rural transformation are aligned with this challenge. Beyond the need to tackle
inter-household inequality, attention to within-household disparities will also be important
(including gender inequality, see Box 2).
Box 2: Empowering women
The Government of Rwanda has made significant gains in its commitment to achieving gender equity. The 2003
Rwandan Constitution enshrines the principle of gender equality by providing 30 percent quotas for women's
representation in decision-making structures. The Government has also included gender as a cross-cutting theme in
their Vision 2020 and EDPRS. The overall goal is that by 2020 “girls and boys will have achieved equity of voice,
participation, and access to every area of economic growth and poverty reduction represented in national policy and
law”. The specific target areas are:
 Gender equity in halving the proportion of people living below the poverty line by 2015,
 Gender equity in a reduced income disparity,
 Gender equity in increased GDP per capita,
 Gender equity within the increased average GDP growth rate, and
 Gender equity in progress toward the MDGs.
There are indications that the status of women is improving in some sectors. Rwanda has a consistently improving
score on the UNDP Gender Inequality Index (positioned at 73 out of 167 countries). In 2013 Rwanda had the
world’s highest women’s participation in parliament at 64 percent, up from just 17.1 percent 15 years earlier. The
Rwanda National Police Service has achieved 37.5 percent women in leadership positions. In local-level
government, women still are under-represented – only 6.7 percent of mayors are women – although 43 percent of
local government positions and 30 percent of judgeships are held by women.
Despite successes, women in Rwanda still face challenges. More female-headed households live in poverty than
those headed by males (47 percent compared to 44 percent, respectively). Women’s literacy rates are lower than
men’s (60 percent compared to 70 percent, respectively), which further constrains already limited opportunities in
terms of accessing resources, creating and managing small businesses, and participating in the overall decisionmaking processes in the households. And gender-based violence among women and girls remains an area of serious
concern. In 2010 at least 56 percent of women aged 15-49 years had experienced physical or sexual violence.
This CPS draws upon the findings of the Bank's Gender Assessment (2012) and discusses this and other key
analyses to inform the strategy.

IV.

Development Challenges

50.
The Government uses the ambitious nature of its goals as a driving force for change.
It recognizes that the higher the ambition, the greater the challenges. To a large extent,
challenges are well described in the EDPRS 2. During the consultation process for the EDPRS 2
and in sector working groups, many discussions have centered on how best to tackle the
challenges.

A.

From public‐led to private‐led growth

51.
Accelerating growth and creating jobs through the intensification and deepening of
the private sector lies at the heart of the development challenge and implies significant
action at policy and investment levels. The targets for economic growth, export growth, and
enterprise growth suggest a significant restructuring of the economy. Progress in these goals will
underpin progress in the poverty targets to an important degree, through their implications for
rural development and job creation. The imperative for job creation is extremely strong; the total
non-farm labor force increased from 442,000 in 2001 to 1.4 million in 2011. About 100,000
formal and informal jobs are currently created each year, which is only half the annual growth
needed to maximize benefits from the demographic dividend.
16

52.
Despite the strong performance with respect to the investment climate, multiple
challenges complicate progress. The private sector is still relatively small and weak, with a
narrow manufacturing base, small financial sector, and an underdeveloped services sector. Local
business registrations have increased, but only around 40 percent of these firms are active.
Informality prevails as only 13,000 of 123,000 firms operating are in the formal sector.
Geography, low productivity, and high energy costs make Rwanda an expensive place for
enterprises dependent on seaports or energy-intensive processes. As a small economy, the
domestic market is relatively limited; expanding markets on a significant scale beyond borders
has been hampered by cross-border tensions and inefficiencies.
53.
Enterprise surveys highlight access to finance and availability of land as the most
severe constraints followed by infrastructure (electricity and transport) and labor skills.
Other issues relate to the arbitrary, uncertain, and unpredictable way in which certain areas of
regulation are enforced. Issues that are identified by the private sector (including during the
consultations for this CPS) include tax administration, post-implementation problems (e.g.
misunderstandings regarding incentives related to energy and land titles) and potential
competition issues (real or perceived).
54.
It will be particularly important that public investment decisions leverage private
investment to the maximum extent possible. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that
public investment in Rwanda still “crowds in” private investment, but at ratios that are less
favorable than in some other neighboring countries. This indicates that there is room for
improvement in the management of public investment, in particular with respect to ensuring
robust, independent project selection processes (including thorough appraisal and cost benefit
analysis) to ensure that the returns are maximized from scarce investment resources. Poor public
investment choices can not only crowd out private investment, but also erode fiscal space and
debt sustainability over time. Attention to smooth implementation will also be important.

B.

Sharing prosperity

55.
Ensuring that growth translates into further poverty reduction will require directed
investment, including cash transfers, toward improving the incomes of the poorest. The
EDPRS 2 envisages considerable investment in agriculture – focusing on agricultural
productivity and rural infrastructure – to drive transformation of livelihoods in rural areas.
Despite recent gains, the move from subsistence to commercial agriculture remains a challenge.
Food is about 70 percent of output, farm productivity is low, and plot sizes are small (about 0.3
hectare), leaving it hard to make space for mainstream commercial agriculture. Irrigation is not
yet widespread; use of improved seed is still constrained; and, though rising, only one-third of
farmers are using fertilizers.
56.
Generating a serious private agribusiness sector will entail investment in value
chains and agro-processing and a shift toward higher-value crops, which require
specialized technical know-how and value-chain expertise. The rewards in terms of poverty
reduction and boosting exports could be considerable however. Tea and coffee already contribute
to half of all exports, involving 500,000 households in coffee production and 60,000 households
in tea production. However, only 29 percent of coffee is washed despite the 60 percent price
premium accorded to washed coffee. Branding, traceability, and certification are key for
developing a viable horticulture export industry, but low-income farmers will find these
activities costly and will need support.
17

57.
For the poorest groups, expansion and improvements of the social protection system
will remain critical. A thoughtful government roadmap embodied in the EDPRS and National
Social Protection Strategy sets out the key steps toward improving the social protection system,
including the introduction of stronger targeting mechanisms, a scale-up of coverage, and a
determined focus (and EDPRS target) on promoting an exit from the poorest categories.

C.

Financing the development effort

58.
At a price tag of Rwanda Francs (RWF) 9.9 trillion (US$15 billion), adequate
financing of the development strategy will pose its own challenges of intensifying domestic
revenue collection and management of external revenue sources. Despite an improving trend,
Rwanda’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio at 14.2 percent in 2013 was well below the regional average
of 25 percent and the Government has embarked on a comprehensive tax reform strategy.
Boosting domestic revenue mobilization raises several challenges; broadening the tax base,
introducing comprehensive tax regimes for agriculture and mining, and strengthening property
taxation and enhancing revenue administration are all prerequisites. Given the intensity of the
financing gap and the expected relative decline in external concessional financing, efforts to
prioritize and sequence public investments by the Government will be important.

D.

Ensuring institutions and capacity keep pace with growth

59.
Managing the wide-ranging consequences of rapid growth will require flexibility,
strong feedback loops, and capacity to respond to unforeseen developments. Rapid
economic growth is an overwhelmingly positive force for generating sustainable change for poor
populations. Nevertheless, if targets are reached – or even nearly reached – the changes that the
Rwandan economy and society will have undergone as part of this process will be significant.
People will be earning livelihoods differently from before, living in different places from before,
using their assets (especially land and human capital) differently from before, moving around
differently, structuring families differently, consuming differently, aspiring differently, and
relating to other stakeholders – both non-state and state actors – differently. Natural resources
will be used differently as the economy is dominated less by subsistence agriculture and more by
commercial agriculture and off-farm activities. As growth becomes driven more by private sector
growth, the role of the state in the economy will need to adapt, taking on a role as facilitator
more than owner. Institutions will need to respond to these changes. Keeping pace with the
changes could be a challenge.
60.
Building the capacity of government staff and institutions will be critical to
managing this change process well. The strength of capacity at the top levels of leadership in
central government agencies has not yet cascaded down fully – neither to the lower levels of
seniority in the central agencies nor to many of the local agencies that are frontline implementers
of policy or deliverers of services. It will be important for the National Capacity Building
Secretariat to enhance its facilitation and support to all the priority sectors (energy, agriculture,
private sector development, environment and natural resources, urbanization and transport) to
undertake capacity-building diagnostics and to design the proposed sector capacity building
plans throughout the EDPRS 2 period.
61.
Enhancing district-level capacity will be foundational for achieving goals associated
with the “accountable governance” pillar of the EDPRS2. This is true particularly for those
goals that strive for greater citizen participation in the development process and those related to
18

the quality of service delivery. The newly approved decentralization policy is an excellent
starting point and implies considerable efforts in strengthening effectiveness at the district level
and in reforming the mechanics of center-district relations.

V.

Strategic Options for the CPS: Leveraging WBG Assets

62.
Though Government goals and the associated challenges suggest potential for
considerable WBG engagement, maximizing impact with limited WBG resources demands
focus and boundaries. The Government maps the flows of development assistance carefully and
is directive in matching donors and sectoral financing needs. The mapping provided by
Government provides a useful tool in identifying the comparative advantage for the WBG and in
the application of selectivity. In defining the CPS going forward and, in particular, in deciding
where the core of IDA will be spent, the principles applied in identifying the most fruitful areas
for WBG engagement in Rwanda covered the following:






Is there strong alignment with the twin goals and complementary nationally defined
goals for poverty reduction? Will engagement in this area unblock major impediments to
progress?
Given the flows of other donor resources and WBG skills and experience in Rwanda,
does WBG have a comparative advantage in this area that will allow it to make a
difference?
Does engagement in this area allow WBG to maximize all three of its institutions in the
most synergistic way?
Is there demand from the client for engagement by WBG in this sector?
What are the risk levels of achieving impact in this sector, in particular with respect to
capacity constraints on the Government and WBG side?

63.
Table 2 summarizes the discussions that have taken place within the country team,
with the client and with other development partners with respect to WBG’s potential role
in addressing core development constraints. The left column lists constraints to achieving key
poverty objectives as identified through WBG analytical work and Government strategies. Any
sectors that “failed” the first line of screening with respect to alignment to poverty reduction (for
example, cultural heritage) are left out of the table. In general, the low scores for comparative
advantage reflect the dominance of other donors in these sectors and the expectation that they
will continue to finance these sectors at the same level and same high quality. For example, the
combination of global funds and bilateral financing from USAID in the health sector suggests
little value added in directing IDA toward the sector. In this respect, a low rating for comparative
advantage does not refer to the competencies of the WBG in general. Rather it reflects the
contextual, relative advantage of the WBG given the resources that other donors are bringing to
Rwanda.

Based on an analysis of needs and comparative advantage, the choices of sector
engagement for the WBG align well with the Government requests. WBG has been asked to
lead the development partners in energy and urban development sectors, be actively engaged (but
not lead) in the rural development sector, and to operate through low-transaction cost modalities
in the social protection sector. The Government also asked that the World Bank work with
DFID, KfW and the EU to support progress on public financial management (PFM) and
decentralization. IFC believes it will be able to invest primarily in the financial sector, supported
by both IFC advisory and World Bank analytical work. Indeed, financing for financial
institutions is likely to be IFC’s main (but far from only) investment activity in Rwanda in the
medium term.
65.
The analysis suggests the following 3 themes will guide WBG engagement in
Rwanda:


Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that is private-sector driven and job creating,
incorporating WBG investments and analytical work in energy, financial sector
development, urban development, regional integration, direct investments in the private
sector, public-private partnerships, and investment climate (including export
competitiveness and other private sector development policy work);



Theme 2: Improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural
development and social protection, including investments in the national safety nets and
smaller investments in activities that promote social cohesion and peacebuilding,
20

agricultural productivity (including rural roads), and IFC investments in horticulture,
agribusiness, and microfinance;


Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance through public financial management
and decentralization, including likely IDA investment in fostering stronger results in
public financial management, fiscal decentralization, in statistical systems and open data.

A.
Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that is private‐sector driven
and job creating
66.
Structural transformation is needed to move the economic growth path from one
that is dominated by ODA-financed public investment to one that is fully driven by the
private sector. This is an imperative for sustainability of the growth path but is also vital for job
creation. With an estimated 200,000 people entering the job market annually, the private sector
will be a primary provider of livelihoods and an important driver of poverty reduction. Despite
the high scores for a supportive regulatory environment in the Doing Business ranking, the
private sector is currently still weak and underdeveloped. The WBG will tackle the key
bottlenecks that have restricted private sector investment through a combination of IDA
investments (in energy, urban development, and regional integration), IFC investments (in the
financial sector and possibly – crossing over with the second thematic area – in agribusiness) and
IFC advisory/World Bank analytical work to strengthen the regulatory framework to increase
predictability and reduce regulatory risks.
67.
A propitious investment climate with predictable rules that attract investors and
reward them on their own merits is a key component for ensuring healthy, efficient and
sustainable private sector development. Policies that ensure open markets, an environment that
reduces entry costs and operational risks, policies that minimize distortions on the level playing
field, and rules that prevent anticompetitive business practices are key areas for a growthenhancing market regulatory framework. The WBG will support the Government of Rwanda to
develop an effective institutional and regulatory framework to effectively implement competition
and investment policies that foster competitive markets and productivity.
Energy
68.
Why is energy so important for private sector-led growth? There is significant survey
data from enterprises in Rwanda to suggest that the high cost and low reliability of energy is one
of the primary bottlenecks to the enterprise development. Likewise, there is ample evidence that
rural electrification has benefits in terms of consumption (as small, rural business activity
requires electricity) and human capital accumulation. Insufficient generating capacity, limited
transmission networks, and high cost of electricity are major constraints on investment. There is
a clear sense that overcoming this constraint will bring about a lasting, structural shift in the
economy. Power prices are high (despite subsidies) at 22¢ to 24¢ per kilowatt-hour (kWh)
relative to neighbors: tariffs in Kenya are 15¢ per kWh; Uganda, 17¢ per kwh; Tanzania, 5¢ per
kwh), undermining Rwanda’s competitiveness. Electricity consumption is currently about onetenth of the Sub-Saharan average, with coverage of about 18 percent of population.
69.
Increased access to electricity is key to the countries’ poverty reduction and
economic growth and broad-based welfare gains. The plans for expansion require US$3-5
million financing per megawatt (MW), or about US$800 million annually, and will include both
experimental (methane) and high-risk (geothermal) energy sources. The current installed
21

electricity generation capacity is about 110MW, with available capacity of about 95MW and
peak demand of 90MW. The system is operating without a reserve margin resulting in poor
reliability and availability of supply. The Government has ambitious plans to expand the
generation capacity to meet the country’s projected demand. The plan is to increases total
installed capacity over the next 5 years from 110MW in 2013 to about 563MW by 2018, with
connections forecast to leap from 200,000 to 1,200,000 and biomass use to drop from 86 percent
to 65 percent by 2017. These targets are not beyond reach; a committed capacity of 76.5MW is
expected to be commissioned by June 2014. Memoranda of Understanding have been signed for
an additional capacity of about 200MW in the next 4-5 years.
70.
To leverage funding for energy generation, the Government proposes mostly private
sector-led investment. This offers the WBG opportunity to leverage funding and enhance
collaboration among the WBG in supporting increased electricity generation. There is also need
to balance public investments in the sector without crowding out the private sector. For a number
of these investments, discussions are advanced and some projects already under construction. In
some instances, the Government may require support to reach financial closure on some of the
proposed generation investments, which might include a combination of IDA partial risk
guarantees and MIGA guarantees, IFC loans as well as other WBG financial products. In
addition, IDA resources may be required to undertake upstream assessments, such as feasibility
studies and transaction advisory services, especially geothermal due diligence subject to
confirmation of the resource. IFC is tentatively predicting investments in the energy sector of
approximately US$30 million over the CPS period. IFC investment climate activities will also
support private sector participation in renewable energy, including the Rwanda Development
Board (RDB), Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority (RURA), and Ministry of Infrastructure
(MININFRA) to strengthen capacity to deal with investment proposals. It will also expand the
work on feed in tariffs currently prevailing for hydro, solar and small-scale biomass in order for
more standard power purchases to be developed. MIGA’s traditional political risk insurance
coverage against transfer and convertibility restrictions, expropriation, breach of contract and
war and civil disturbance can help leverage cross-border investment, in particular for critical
infrastructure, such as power, water and transportation. During the CPS period, MIGA will
actively look for opportunities in these sectors as well as in agribusiness.
71.
In the long-term, the integration of Rwanda’s power sector within the East African
Power Pool is indispensable. Rwanda is a member of the Nile Basin Initiative and the East
Africa Power Pool. However, apart from its share in existing regional hydro plants,13 Rwanda is
not connected to any regional transmission network apart from the small bilateral power
interchanges with Uganda. Rwanda’s location would allow it to benefit from the interconnected
power network within the proposed East African Power Pool. In light of Rwanda’s current highgeneration costs and energy resource constraints, regional integration would unlock the benefits
of regional hydropower, geothermal, wind and natural gas resources, substantially reducing
overall generation investment costs. Several regional interconnection lines are at various stages
of development; Rwanda-Uganda and Uganda-Kenya are expected to be commissioned in 2015
while other interconnections between Rwanda-Tanzania, Rwanda-Burundi, and Rwanda-DRC

13

Presently Rwanda purchases power from the Rusizi I plant (with import capacity of 3.5 MW) of SNEL of DRC, and Rusizi II
(with import capacity of 12 MW), owned by Sinelac (jointly owned by Rwanda, DRC, and Burundi).

22

will form part of the Rusumo and Rusizi hydro projects. Rwanda has initiated discussions to
import 50MW from Uganda and has made initial contacts with Ethiopia.
72.
With an emphasis on using private sector resources for generation, the comparative
advantage of IDA may well be to focus on strengthening the overall performance of the
sector and on distribution, areas unlikely to attract the private sector. Recent changes to the
institutional structures – the separation of the former utility into two distinct entities to cover
electricity and water separately – suggests the need for considerable institutional strengthening.
A recent grid audit study highlights many important priorities for investment in order to improve
the functionality and expand the outreach of the network. It provides a solid starting point for
possible IDA investment in this area.
Urban development
73.
Why is urban development a priority for the inclusive growth agenda? In a region with
low levels of urbanization, Rwanda is among the least urbanized countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
with an urbanization rate of about 15 percent. Of the roughly 1.6 million urban dwellers, about 1
million live in Kigali. From previously high average annual growth rates of 9 percent (due in
large part to the influx of post-genocide returnees), Kigali’s growth has decelerated to a stillrapid 4 percent per year. The remainder of the urban population (roughly 600,000) is dispersed
across provincial towns in 27 districts. These are small urban centers, and not more than 10
towns have sufficient density to truly reflect urban attributes and functions. The most viable
towns are located near borders, at the intersection of national roads leading to borders, or in the
vicinity of Kigali. Rubavu, Musanze, Muhanga and Huye are growing rapidly. Despite a current
low level of urbanization, the country is poised for an urban transformation.
74.
The Government of Rwanda aims to expand the share of the industrial sector from
16 percent to 26 percent of GDP by 2020 while continuing to improve the productivity and
value addition in the agriculture sector. While agriculture employs 80 percent of the
workforce and represents 33 percent of GDP, the Government’s industrial policy aims to sustain
8 percent annual growth and to create 1.8 million non-farm jobs by 2020. Given land constraints,
this goal must be met through expansion of commerce, industry, construction, and services
sectors in urban centers.
75.
The Government is pursuing a policy of more balanced, sustainable urban
development. Kigali has emerged as Rwanda’s national business, service, industrial and
administrative hub; it accommodates 30 percent of employment and 10 percent of the population.
Within this environment, however, the Government is concerned about the potential negative
consequences of economic and population concentration in one city, which can lead to economic
weaknesses in other regions; regional social imbalances across the country; and congestion,
pollution, slums, and other negative externalities—within the primary city—that can become
unmanageable. Therefore maintaining the attractiveness of Kigali while developing the
economic potential of secondary cities is the Government’s central challenge of this policy. The
urban strategy is therefore centered on developing six secondary urban centers for a more
balanced urban growth. The role and function of these towns will depend on their size, but their
development can have a significant impact on developing the economy and reducing migration
to Kigali, if managed properly.
76.
The policy to spur urbanization also has the potential to reduce poverty. Though
analytical work on the poverty impacts of urbanization is scarce, ongoing work in the Rwanda
23

Poverty Assessment suggests positive impacts. Between 2006 and 2011, poor households in
urban areas were 14 percentage points more likely to exit poverty than poor households in rural
areas. The rate of chronic poverty (households who were below the poverty line in both 2006
and 2011) was also three times lower for urban (14 percent) than for rural households (42
percent). 14 In addition, urbanization is typically linked to lower fertility, higher female labor
force participation, and higher investments in children’s education.
77.
The WBG work in the urban sector in Rwanda is in the earliest stages, making the
prediction of future investments imprecise. The team is exploring the use of IDA in providing
the necessary infrastructure for the sustainable development of secondary cities. This would
incorporate work that supports the goals set out in the private sector development strategy and
would also focus on the governance environment for effective management of secondary cities.
IFC is currently considering investments in housing units for Kigali and the possibility of
opening a mortgage finance facility. IFC has also been investigating the possibility of a PPP
transaction for the bulk water supply for Kigali. Though design of the entry points for the WBG
is still preliminary, the opportunities for a strongly collaborative effort between IDA and the IFC
are clearly present.
78.
IFC is rolling out some of its IT-based activities to cities across the country as part
of its investment climate work. This will include establishment of on-line construction permit
applications at the two or three of the 6 secondary cities with sufficient absorptive capacity. One
stop centers for construction permit administration are being established in each location through
the Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA) to handle the predicted increased number of applications
for construction permits and manage the lack of resources at the district level.
Financial Sector
79.
Why the focus on the financial sector? Insufficient access to affordable credit is listed as
the biggest constraint for businesses in the enterprise survey. Figure 8 illustrates how constrained
borrowing from commercial banks is relative to other countries in the sub-region. Widespread
informality hinders financial sector growth, and only 7 percent of adults are covered by a credit
bureau. Bank penetration, saving rates, uptake of microfinance products, and mobile platforms
are all low compared to regional peers.

80.
The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA have all been active in the financial sector. The
World Bank’s role has been more through the provision of technical assistance and analytical
work than through investment; the first Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) provided
extensive guidance to the BNR in many aspects of financial sector development, and about 90
percent of the recommendations (of which there were several hundred) have been implemented.
The Cabinet has now approved the second FSDP (FSDP II). Both FSDPs were based on
Financial Sector Assessment Programs carried out jointly by the World Bank and the IMF. The
World Bank is providing considerable support to FSDP II implementation using programmatic
trust funds.
81.
Through a US$2 million FIRST-funded technical assistance program, 15 the legal
and regulatory framework and supervisory capacity of the financial sector are being
strengthened and Rwanda’s crisis preparedness, resilience, and financial stability are being
improved. Financial inclusion for individuals as well as micro, small, and medium-size
enterprises (MSMEs) will be supported through technical assistance provided through the
Financial Inclusion Support Framework (US$2-3 million). This program will address demand as
well as supply-side challenges, stretching from financial education and consumer protection to
support for legal and regulatory reforms related to financial inclusion and improving schemes for
supporting MSME financing.
82.
For the IFC, the financial sector provides an opportunity for investments in small
enterprises. Opportunities for IFC to invest directly in enterprises that seek to operate in
Rwanda have been constrained by the small size of these projects. The bulk of the private sector
comprises small firms who are making small investments that are not bankable for IFC
participation. IFC anticipates investments in the financial sector in the order of US$20 million a
year over the CPS period. The approach would be to deepen the engagement with local banks
and micro-finance institutions, leveraging both advisory and investment services to expand
finance (both in volume and in range of products) to MSMEs with a full range of trade and
supply chains, long-term and local currency products. The Access to Finance engagement will
15

25

focus on MSME bankability and risk management. IFC will also consider engagement in the
housing finance market.
83.
Recognizing that the investment rate is insufficient to drive the rates of growth that
are foreseen, IFC also aims to provide support in developing capital markets. The current
reliance on imported capital (government debt, donors, foreign direct investment) implies foreign
exchange risk for those seeking finance. Domestic capital markets can provide more reliable
financing for the private sector and could be a source of lower-cost, longer-term local currency
financing for Rwandan and possibly for regional players too small to issue in Nairobi or
Johannesburg. IFC will provide advice on capital market development, with the Access to
Finance team providing support to develop capital market infrastructure (including rating
agencies, custodians, electronic trading platform, regulatory capacity, corporate governance and
brokers). IFC Treasury is in discussion with Government to launch a local currency bond.

B.
Theme 2: Improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through
rural development and social protection
84.
As Bank analysis of poverty shows, growth alone will not be sufficient to reach
poverty targets. International and national goals for poverty reduction are only attainable with a
strategy that builds the incomes of the poorest quintiles and ensures that the prosperity that is
generated by growth is adequately shared. Activities under this theme are chosen to deliver
maximum impact on the incomes of the poorest and most vulnerable groups in Rwanda.
Rural Development
85.
Close to 80 percent of the Rwandan labor force depends on agriculture for a living.
The fastest and most effective way to raise the standards of living of the majority of the
population is therefore to increase incomes from agriculture. The improvements in agriculture
have played a major role in the rapid poverty reduction Rwanda experienced over the past
decade. 35 percent of the reduction in poverty in Rwanda can be attributed to increased
agricultural production while an extra 10 percent can be explained by increased
commercialization of agricultural produce (refer to Figure 3). This makes agriculture the single
most important driver of the 14 percentage-point drop in poverty over the past decade.
86.
Between 2000 and 2011, aggregate agricultural production almost doubled, with
most of the increase happening since 2008 (Figure 9). This can be traced back to the
Government’s renewed focus on agriculture under the first EDPRS (2008-12). Since 2008, the
Government has embarked on an ambitious plan to modernize and raise the productivity of
agriculture, which has led to significant gains in productivity of the selected priority crops:
between 2008 and 2011, yields (production per hectare) of maize increased by 225 percent, rice
by 34 percent, wheat by 129 percent, cassava by 90 percent, potatoes by 66 percent, and bananas
by 62 percent.16

87.
Intensifying agricultural productivity will remain central in the IDA program.
Given the limited scope to expand cultivable land area, improved productivity of agricultural
land is critical for income generation. IDA will support a whole suite of interventions aimed to
boost productivity based around soil conservation and land husbandry. This will include
progressive and radical terraces, soil fertility management, and soil erosion control. It will also
include measures that reinforce farmer resilience to shocks (irrigation and water management),
the expansion of agricultural mechanization (currently stands at 12 percent), and the optimization
of inputs to improve soil fertility and seed quality.
88.
Investments will also facilitate a transition from subsistence to more commercial
farming practices, tackling under-employment in rural areas and raising rural incomes.
IDA will support strengthening the enabling environment to attract and retain private investment,
encourage entrepreneurship, and facilitate market access. This will include modalities to increase
production via facilitating contract farming, satellite farming, consolidated land leasing, and
cooperatives. Public-private partnerships and risk management in value chains would be
supported. Priority value chains, both agricultural food and export crops, will be supported along
with strengthening cross-border trade channels. Support will be provided for whole value chains
from research, planting material, production, extension, post-harvest, value addition in
processing, and market analysis of supply and demand. Support will also be provided to
expanding both the provision of and access to agriculture finance. Key market-oriented
infrastructure, including irrigation, post-harvest handling and storage, and rural feeder roads will
be supported to facilitate greater production and market access.
89.
Nutrition components in WBG agriculture work will remain, given the persistent
challenge of child malnutrition in rural areas. IDA will support food-insecure households in
nutritious home garden practices and diversifying food production by scaling-up the current
kitchen gardens program, promoting intercropping, and developing and expanding bio-fortified
food crops.
90.
IFC intends to focus advisory services and possible investments on the development
of horticulture and other agribusiness ventures. While IFC is aware of the obstacles, it
remains hopeful that potential transactions with sponsors will materialize. MIGA looks to
support new projects in the agribusiness sector for which it has an active pipeline. IFC is
27

considering investment in the tea sector and currently providing advisory services. IFC also
expects to be involved in the provision of financial services to the rural sector through the
financing of a greenfield microfinance institution as well as through conventional financial
services.
Social Protection
91.
Rwanda has made important gains in protecting the most vulnerable groups by
stabilizing their livelihoods and providing many with an exit from poverty. IDA’s support
under this CPS period will focus on consolidating past progress while introducing and scaling up
measures that are fundamental to further strengthening of Rwanda’s social protection system.
This support will be fully aligned with Rwanda’s 2013 National Social Protection Strategy and
the 2013 EDPRS 2, and carried out in close coordination with the other main donors in the social
protection sector.
92.
IDA will support expanded coverage of Rwanda’s social protection system, notably
the flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP). This program was launched in 2008 as
the principal tool for reaching the poor and extreme poor and fostering an exit from poverty. The
program has four main components: (a) direct support cash transfer program to support
extremely poor labor constrained households; (b) public works component to provide wagebased temporary employment to poor households; (c) financial services for the poor; and (d)
community sensitization and capacity building. The VUP direct support cash transfer program is
present in 58 percent of sectors and currently serves over 44,000 households; the VUP public
works program is present in 43 percent of sectors and currently serves over 89,000 households.
93.
An ambitious, ongoing expansion of VUP program coverage will be a core area of
Bank support. This expansion of coverage will be informed by strengthened poverty targeting
to ensure that those most in need are served. Continued reforms to the poverty targeting system
will be supported to ensure the prioritization of the poorest households, coupled with a priority
expansion to sectors in the poorest 30 percent of districts.
94.
Reforms will also include a focus on early childhood development to help tackle the
issue of inter-generational poverty, ensuring a strong base for Rwanda's future
development. Malnutrition affects over 40 percent of children under age 5 in Rwanda, and
poverty is disproportionally concentrated among children. Ensuring sustainable graduation from
poverty requires investments in productivity, beginning in the earliest years. These reforms will
focus on the complements between income support and behavioral changes among parents to
ensure that children receive both appropriate protection and are supported to make needed
investments in health, nutrition and cognitive stimulation.
95.
Support will also include a continued focus on strengthening core service delivery
elements central to the effective management and improved harmonization of Rwanda's
social protection system. This will include a focus on an improved management information
system, a strengthened beneficiary registry, and improved payment systems in line with global
good practice. It will also include a continued focus on increased harmonization and
transparency across the main social protection programs, notably VUP, the Genocide Survivors
Support Fund (FARG), the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Program, and the
Decentralization Funding Program. An emphasis on performance management, evaluation, and
learning will connect support for reforms to analytical work on poverty, and will include work
28

using the Integrated Household Living Condition (EICV) Survey to assess the benefit incidence
and contributions of the flagship VUP program to poverty reduction.
96.
Neither IFC nor MIGA are likely to be heavily involved in the social protection
sector, but IFC’s engagement in the microfinance sector and support for MSME through
conventional bank financing provides part of the support needed as people exit out of social
protection.
97.
Beyond the poverty–targeted safety net, smaller amounts of IDA are likely to be
targeted towards other vulnerable groups. This includes work to scale up a successful onestop shop for victims of gender-based violence across the nation. It also involves a continuation
of highly successful work with ex-combatants who had been fighting in eastern DRC against the
Rwandan state. The latter provides support to ex-fighters seeking to give up weapons and
resume more peaceful livelihoods and ensures that they have the tools and resources to
reintegrate effectively into their communities.

C.
Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance through public financial
management and decentralization
98.
Literature indicates that decentralization, done well, brings benefits to populations
in terms of quality of service delivery and a stronger match between services needed and
services provided. Even with a decade of positive developments, the Government recognizes
that much remains to be done to reach the country’s goals in terms of democratic, participatory,
local governance and effective citizen-centered service delivery. One of key priorities in the
EDPRS 2 is to further improve the quality of service delivery through improved citizen
participation. This will require greater administrative capacity (building skills, planning, M&E
and PFM systems) and strengthened accountability for performance at the both central and
subnational level. Subnational capacity building and PFM are considered foundational crosscutting issues that need to be addressed to improve decentralized service delivery.
99.
Low volumes of revenues and a weak link between availability of district-level
resources and service delivery indicators are major challenges for fiscal decentralization in
Rwanda. A powerful argument for decentralizing responsibility for service delivery to
subnational governments is their proximity to and understanding of local needs. Sufficient fiscal
resources and discretion over service delivery responsibilities are core features of effective
decentralization, but discretionary revenues (sum of block grants and own revenues) in Rwanda
constitute only 30 percent of total revenues. Earmarked transfers, over which subnational
governments generally have limited control, account for more than 60 percent of total revenues.
Service delivery indicators are only partially taken into account in the current allocation
formulas.
100. Progress on administrative decentralization varies across sectors. The Government
recognizes the need to improve the clarity of roles and responsibilities between national and
subnational entities while deepening the overall devolution of power. Beyond clarifying roles,
however, there is an overwhelming need for strengthened capacity at subnational levels; there are
challenges in recruiting, attracting, and retaining staff even in central government, but the

29

constraints at subnational level are particularly trenchant.17 These gaps affect priority sectors for
service delivery, such as agriculture.
101. There is an acknowledged need for further political decentralization, in particular
intensifying citizen participation, expanding the role of civil society organizations, and
encouraging fiduciary accountability. The Citizens Report Card exercise (2012) revealed that
citizen participation was particularly weak in areas such as participation in the district budgetary
process (27 percent). One such participation mechanism, the Joint Action Development Forum
through, for example, the broader use of ICT and community radio, could be backed up by
stronger efforts to inform citizens on their rights to participate and by a legal framework for
access to information. Fiduciary accountability systems at local government level require
significant attention; weak internal controls in financial management and reporting are identified
by the 2010 PEFA.18
102. The Government has requested inclusion in the Bank’s Global Partnership for
Social Accountability (GPSA) program. A call for proposals focused on the promotion of
social accountability in service delivery resulted in several applications, though none from
Rwanda has yet been successful. Government and Bank-financed investments alike would
benefit from increased monitoring and oversight by non-state stakeholders.
103. There are ongoing discussions with the Government regarding IDA support to
Government’s efforts to promote accountable governance. Building on achievements made
through the decentralized service delivery policy operation in 2013, a team is preparing a
Program for Results (PforR) operation that would drive results in areas of public financial
management, fiscal decentralization, statistical capacity, and open data. Government strategies
and expenditure programs to promote accountable governance in these areas already exist and
the team is currently constructing realistic disbursement-linked indicators from these strategies.
IDA’s work on accountable governance will be oriented, to a considerable degree, toward
improving state effectiveness in local-level government. Synergies emerge in IFC’s plans to
decentralize its progress in investment climate work to local authorities. While the Government
has made impressive strides in passing legislation that improves the investment climate,
implementation can be patchy at local government levels (in particular with respect to local tax
administration and some elements of investor aftercare). Transparent regulations, firm feedback
mechanisms, and capacity building for local offices that deliver services to the private sector will
be an important part of the investment climate work going forwards.

D.

Across the Three Themes

104. The process of preparing this CPS has been a joint one; and, though business plans
are not firmed up yet, there are a number of concrete ideas on collaborative work among
the WBG institutions. IFC’s likely focus on investments in horticulture/agribusiness, the
financial sector and the infrastructure sectors (especially energy) provide a sound basis for
productive synergies within the WBG. Areas of cooperation include water supply, the power
sector and agriculture. Increased use of MIGA guarantees offers reassurance for foreign
investors, including investors into public-private partnerships, and thus can support the
17

The National Skills Audit in 2009 identified a 60% skills gap in the country and a serious shortage of human capital in the
public sector with gaps concentrated in the professional cadre.
18
According to the Auditor General’s Report for Districts of 2011, none of 30 districts received a clean audit.

30

Government’s efforts to attract foreign direct investment into the country. During the CPS
period, MIGA will continue to seek opportunities to support private investments into Rwanda, in
particular in EDPRS 2 target areas. In addition, MIGA’s Small Investment Program offers
political risk insurance that would be appealing to smaller and medium-sized investment in the
agribusiness and tourism sectors. There are, however, limitations in the extent to which IFC and
MIGA can “lead the market” since it is the existence of domestic and international sponsors
looking to do specific deals that largely determine how their business volumes develop.
Regional integration: Foundation for future growth
105. Rwanda’s size and location will mean that stronger integration with regional
economies will be vital for further growth. There are two elements to this. The first relates to
the need to expand markets for potential investors to turn “land-locked” into “land-linked” in the
interests of competitiveness. Countries of the region represent potential markets for exports,
managers of transport corridors, and facilitators of cross-border trade. Secondly, regional
integration and cross-border investments will hopefully bring with it greater political stability
and security in the region.
106. Rwanda has expressed its interest in a number of cross-border investments in the
Great Lakes region to make use of regional IDA resources. These include the financing of
hydropower generation on the borders with DRC and Burundi (Rusizi 1, 2, and 3) and improved
transport connections (for example, the rehabilitation of Kamembe airport in the south-west,
which serves a largely regional market). IFC and MIGA are also interested in engaging in such
projects where a role for the private sector exists (for example, the Rusizi 3 Power Generation
Project). Some of IFC’s Rwanda-based clients already serve both the domestic market and those
of neighboring countries, particularly eastern DRC.
107. A prerequisite for regional integration and cross-border investment is regional
peace and security. Last year’s signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for
the Great Lakes Region, the historic visit by the UN Secretary General and WBG President, and
the recent defeat of one of many rebel groups in eastern DRC all provide a call for more stability
in the region. However, an estimated 1,200 members of the Forces Démocratiques de Libération
du Rwanda (FDLR) remain outside of Rwanda, primarily in eastern DRC. The continued
presence in eastern DRC of FDLR and Rwandese associated with the 1994 Genocide is an
ongoing destabilizing factor in the region and remains of great concern to the Government of
Rwanda. IDA continues support to the Government in demobilizing Rwandan combatants
fighting in eastern DRC and providing adequate resources to ensure ex-combatants reintegrate
peacefully into their communities.
108. Looking East, Rwanda has expressed interest in a number of projects that could
provide faster access to the sea or more reliable access to affordable energy. The longerterm health of the energy sector in Rwanda, with some initiatives underway, will require that
they are able to purchase power from the sub-region. Likewise, improving the functionality of
transport corridors could enhance the competitiveness of Rwanda-based businesses. A pipeline
for possible projects in the EAC is under preparation.
109. IDA support to regional integration is strongly backed by the work of the wider
WBG. Beyond IFC and MIGA engagement in investments in cross-border, the investment
climate work will continue with a tax law compliance project to improve the ease of doing
31

business within the EAC and support on addressing legal inconsistencies with the EAC common
market protocol as identified through the Common Market Scorecard.
Maximizing externalities for the development agenda
110. Selectivity implies limited activity in some sectors that are of priority to reducing
poverty (refer to Table 2). The process of mapping donor financing to sectors results in a
careful allocation of external financing across the Government’s development goals and
objectives. Annex 7 (and associated tables 15 and 16) demonstrates the division of labor across
donors and gives confidence that other sources of funds are being channeled into sectors where
IDA is less active. Human development sectors, for example, are well-financed through multiple
other sources.
111. Inclusion of particular lenses across the WBG portfolio may help to maximize
externalities for the development agenda and ensure that selectivity does not result in
critical omissions from the WBG. We do not foresee new standalone IDA investments in
either skill development, ICT or climate resilience, but recognize the opportunities these sectors
offer for a sustainable growth path. As part of the CPS preparation process, environment,
education and ICT teams have advised on ways in which operations in priority sectors could seek
to mainstream these issues across the portfolio. In the case of climate resilience, a study has been
prepared that identifies the specific entry points under each sector for IDA engagement.

VI.

Implementation for Results

112. The Rwanda country program as a whole has a strong track record (the Completion
Report rates achievement of objectives as “satisfactory”), and the portfolio is currently
performing well (as it has done in the past). There are no national IDA projects performing
below a “moderately satisfactory” rating. The Government does not appreciate poorly
performing projects and, in general, is swift to take action before projects become categorized as
problematic. The Government’s drive to deliver applies as much to IDA-financed operations as
to domestically financed investments and the implementation of the portfolio benefits from the
Government’s focus on results.

A.

Lessons Learned

113. A number of features have underpinned the strong performance of the portfolio and
provide positive lessons for the future. The Completion Report highlights the importance of
strong Government engagement in the operations and investments. Operations in Rwanda are
strongly directed by client demand, and this serves as a good foundation for solving problems as
they arise during implementation. The move in the previous CAS toward fewer larger operations
that were highly selective in terms of sectors of engagement allowed WBG to concentrate
resources on achieving impact. This is an approach that has been carried through to this CPS. An
effective architecture for Government-donor dialogue has assisted donors to avoid some of the
pitfalls of duplication that exist in other countries and has actively promoted strong collaborative
mechanisms across donors.
114. The draft Completion Report has captured lessons where projects have not
performed so well. For many projects, procurement processes become a bottleneck. The lack of
skills and high turnover in procurement staffing on the government side requires constant handholding by Bank staff to avoid delays. On the Bank side, the lack of skills based in the Rwanda
32

office limits participation by procurement staff in Bank missions and undermines efficient
mission planning. The procurement team in the Rwanda office is currently being strengthened to
better tackle the workload. Investments managed by country-based task team leaders tend to
perform better than those led from a distance. National projects, which tend to perform much
better than regional projects, are more likely to be managed from within country and in part
because they tend to be simpler in design.
115. There has been less success than foreseen in mainstreaming capacity building across
the portfolio. In practice the portfolio has tended to deliver on capacity building more with
respect to implementing WBG investments than tackling more systemic skill deficits. This CPS
is taking a more deliberate approach to integrating skills building across the operational
portfolio.
116. Consistent with their positions on bilateral budget support, some shareholders
became less supportive of delivering IDA to Rwanda through budget support. Until
recently, budget support has been a highly effective instrument for the delivery of predictable,
flexible financing to a reform-minded government that spent the resources well. This trend
changed last year, when several bilateral development partners either suspended or delayed their
budget support. This sudden switch in position brought with it delays to delivery of IDA that in
turn caused severe fiscal difficulties. Though the revenue shortfalls were well managed by the
Government, subsequent budget cuts have taken their toll in the form of depressed growth rates.
117. Given the change in attitudes towards budget support, the Government has asked
the World Bank to consider alternative, more predictable modalities for delivering IDA in
the future. This new partnership strategy anticipates different combinations of instruments that
might both protect the Government from volatility in financing flows and, at the same time, still
offer some flexibility in the financing that is delivered. While the previous CAS was anchored
around budget support, this new CPS proposes less emphasis on development policy instruments.
In its place, the Government has requested that WBG disburse part of their IDA17 allocation in
the form of program for results (PforR) operations. While the previous CAS disbursed 66 percent
in the form of budget support, this CPS is likely to disburse the same proportion as a mix of
PforR and development policy operations.

B.

WBG Portfolio

118. The current IDA portfolio in Rwanda comprises 8 IDA projects and 3 budget
support operations with net commitment of $575 million with undisbursed balance of $328
million, as of mid-April 2014. With the inclusion of trust funded operations, the number of
projects rises to 9, net commitments to US$640 million and the undisbursed balance to US$355
million. Rwanda also participates in 5 regional projects with a national commitment amount of at
least US$189 million. Annex 10 provides an overview of the portfolio. IDA16 allocation for
Rwanda was SDR400 million which is approximately US$617 million, a 54.7 percent increase
from IDA15 (SDR258.5 million).
119. IFC has 10 deals outstanding in Rwanda with committed volume of US$38.34
million. IFC envisages that its investments will rise to US$120 million by the end of the CPS
period, the bulk of which would be in the financial sector. IFC expects to engage in the financial
sector through a local currency credit line and local currency bond issue and to support the
establishment of a microfinance bank. In the infrastructure sector, IFC has identified likely
33

support to the Rusizi 3 power-generation project, Lake Kivu methane extraction projects, and
Kigali Bulk Water Supply. With respect to manufacturing, IFC is considering investment for a
mix-use commercial building in Kigali. In agribusiness, IFC intends to support the tea sector and
horticulture either with direct investments and advice, or indirectly through partner banks. IFC’s
Advisory Services portfolio has been highly valued; the Rwanda Entrepreneurship Development
Program, the Rwanda Investment Climate Program, and the Efficient Security Markets Initiative
(ESMID) have been particularly useful.
120. MIGA currently has two active (KivuWatt and Bakhresa Grain Milling) in Rwanda
with total gross exposure of US$110.1 million. MIGA remains open for business in Rwanda
across all of its political risk insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction,
Expropriation, Breach of Contract, and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring
of Sovereign Obligations.

C.

Proposed Lending and Knowledge work

121. IDA allocations for the CPS period have not yet been determined and remain
indicative. However, the assumption made during CPS preparation is that allocations going
forward will be similar to those in the past. As such, the team is expecting to commit
approximately US$200-250 million a year during IDA1719, likely spread across three investment
operations, 2 PforR operations, and 1 series of three development policy operations. Proposed
lending for the coming year is presented in table 3. Actual allocations will depend on (a) total
IDA resources available; (b) the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population;
(c) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with
Multi-lateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) annual debt service foregone; (d) the performance,
other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (e) the
number of IDA-eligible countries.

122. In Rwanda, with a results-oriented leadership, it seems sensible to re-balance the
portfolio to disburse against measurable and verifiable results. The agriculture sector and
decentralization agenda are strong candidates for trying this approach to IDA delivery, which is
as yet untested in Rwanda. Two operations are already under preparation. It is hoped that the
tighter linkage of financing to results will give all Board members confidence that IDA is being
used for delivery of developmental goals.
123. Tracking results, whether at CPS or project level, requires strong statistical systems
which can generate high-quality data in a timely fashion. The building blocks for a sound
statistical system are largely in place in Rwanda, with a strong statistical agency that conducts
high-quality household surveys (Box 3). These surveys provide data on many of the results that
are important for tracking progress against Government strategies. Most notably, there is a
Living Standards Management Study (LSMS)-style survey about to go into the field (the third in
its series), and another survey planned for 2016/17. As such, WBG will be well placed to track
important social and poverty outcomes over the timeframe of this CPS framework. The WBG
will continue to support the development of these systems over the framework period, including
improving the quality of administrative data that might be important for measuring results in any

The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) was established in 2005. Since its inception, NISR
implemented two Integrated Household Living Conditions Surveys (EICV), two Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS) and one interim-DHS, two Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability and Nutrition Analysis
Surveys, one Population and Housing Census, three National Agricultural Surveys and many smaller surveys
covering specific topics. The Institute also produces on a regular basis the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and a host
of other routine economic statistics. Together with development partners, the World Bank is supporting the NISR
in its rapid development through its contribution to the basket fund for the National Strategy for the Development
of Statistics.
NISR produces core economic statistics (national accounts and CPI) on a regular and timely basis. The CPI is
published each month on the NISR website. National accounts are on quarterly basis and published on the NISR
website by the 15th of the previous month of the subsequent quarter. The National Bank of Rwanda produces
monetary statistics on a monthly basis. Monetary statistics are regularly published on the BNR website while trade
statistics are available upon request. Fiscal data are produced on quarterly basis by the Ministry of Finance
(MINECOFIN). Since 2012, they are unregularly published on the MINECOFIN website
NISR has been remarkably constant in the production of key data. Censuses are implemented every 10 years (last
one in 2012) and every five years there has been a large socioeconomic household survey (EICV) with data on
poverty (2001, 2006, and 2011). The next poverty survey is scheduled for 2013/14. DHS surveys were
implemented in 2000, 2005, and 2010, with an interim one in 2008. The next DHS is planned for 2014/15.

124. The country team proposes a mid-term review of the five-year CPS after 2.5 years.
This will provide an opportunity to revisit the strategy and propose course adjustments, should
they be needed. The team has proposed a results framework for the CPS, which is aligned with
the EDPRS2 and has the support of IFC and MIGA. A summary is included in Table 4 and an
elaborated version is available in Annex 1.

Table 4: Summary of CPS 2014-18 Results Framework
Capacity Building, ICT, Gender, and Environment

Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that is private-sector driven and job-creating
Outcomes:
 Increased generation and access to electricity.
 Development plans for secondary cities developed.
 Improved environment for private sector investments.
 Increased integration into the EAC regional markets.
Theme 2: Improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural development and
social protection
Outcomes:
 Improved agriculture productivity and sustainability.
 Improved access of rural/small farmers to inputs, financing and markets.
 Improved agriculture value chains/linkages.
 Improved rural roads condition and connectivity to market centers.
 Enhanced local government tax generation and administration.
 Enhanced effectiveness and expanded coverage of social protection system.
Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance through public-financial management and
decentralization.
Outcomes:
 Improved delivery of decentralized services.
 Strengthened accountability.

125. Analytical work will, for the large part, be used to inform and support the lending
program. Nevertheless the WBG will continue to undertake AAA and knowledge work in other
excluded areas outside the core six areas of operation where our engagement is considered to
have spillover effects on our current focus areas. As examples, this might include mining,
regional integration, ICT and skill development. An indicative program for AAA and knowledge
work is presented in Table 5.

126. Contributing to the broader knowledge about what works to eradicate poverty in
Rwanda, impact evaluation has been, and will continue to be, an important element of the
portfolio. Several of the ongoing and planned operations have, or plan to have, gold-standard
impact evaluation components, which are being managed in collaboration with DIME (Box 4).
This is true of WBG work in agriculture, rural roads, and access to energy, and the work with the
Adolescent Girls Initiative. The development policy operation series in the social protection has
likewise supported Government-led impact evaluation work.

VII.

Managing Risks

127. The main internal risks to growth and poverty reduction arise from variable
climatic conditions and the private sector response to government reforms. Agriculture is
the main employer and driver of poverty reduction but remains vulnerable to the vicissitudes of
unpredictable weather patterns and regional droughts and floods, which can significantly affect
output and progress on poverty reduction. Stepping up measures to make agriculture more
climate-resilient, for instance through the construction of irrigation facilities and terracing, will
be important for attaining EDPRS 2 targets. More broadly the hope for even more rapid GDP
growth rests on the private sector (including external investors) stepping up to the plate, and in
recent years the response has been a touch muted.
128. The main external risks relate to the pace of regional integration and the potential
for regional conflict, more-rapid-than-expected tapering of donor inflows, and a prolonged
slump in the global economy. As a landlocked country, Rwanda is critically dependent on
closer integration with its neighbors to facilitate imports and exports and drive economic growth.
While strong progress on regional integration could drive economic growth across the region and
boost regional stability, renewed tensions and conflict could stall integration — adversely
affecting Rwanda’s plans to become a regional hub — as well as donor flows with adverse
implications for growth. Rwanda’s high reliance on foreign aid makes its development strategy
vulnerable to reductions in aid flows. While Rwanda is fairly insulated from the global economy
a prolonged slump would nevertheless have a negative impact on growth prospects through
lower demand for goods and services, as well as through more constrained availability of
external financing.

VIII.

Conclusions

129. The resources of the World Bank Group are modest relative to the ambitions and
challenges implied in the strategic plans of the Government of Rwanda. Using these
resources to maximum impact demands selectivity and high levels of collaboration between the
sister organizations. If WBG is going to maximize efficiency in delivery, resources will have to
be delivered through a mix of instruments that balance the need for Government flexibility in the
use of financing against the concerns of certain shareholders who believe that tracking of funds
is useful.
130. The proposed WBG strategy to engage in energy, urban, agriculture, financial
sector, social protection, and accountable governance optimizes the resources of all WBG
elements. With the possible exception of the accountable governance work, both IFC and IDA
resources will be used in all of these areas, and considerable overlap with MIGA’s own
37

priorities. The process of preparing this CPS has clarified multiple areas for close collaboration
and presents a coherent “One Bank Group” approach to supporting Rwanda’s development over
the next five years.

Annex 2: CAS Completion Report
Country: Rwanda
Date of CAS: August 7, 2008
Date of CAS Progress Report: February 9, 2011
Period Covered by CAS Completion Report: FY09-13
CAS Completion Report Prepared by: Peter Isabirye, with inputs from Rwanda Country Team

______________________________________________________________________________
I. Introduction
A. Context
1.
This report presents an assessment of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 21 for the
Republic of Rwanda for the period FY09-12. However, since the Government’s Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS, 2008-12)–on which the CAS was based–was
extended by one year to end June 2013 to enable preparation of the second EDPRS (2013-18); the CAS
had to be extended, as well. Whereas no specific reference to extension was made; the 2011 CAS
Progress Report (CASPR) determined that the overall objectives, as set out in the CAS, remained valid
and relevant. Therefore, this CAS Completion Report (CASCR) and the “CAS period” cover FY09-13.
2.
The CAS Completion Report evaluates program performance and highlights key lessons
learnt. The CASCR evaluates performance of the CAS program implementation by (i) program
performance in influencing CAS outcomes as laid out in the results matrix, and (ii) Bank’s performance
in designing and managing the implementation of the program. It deals with issues relating to the
relevance, results, and impact of the Bank’s activities and draws lessons for developing the forthcoming
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
3.
The report is based on various reference documents22, discussions with the Country Team,
and evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Overall, CAS performance was
satisfactory and Bank performance, superior. Key lessons learned include the need for strong country
ownership, a highly selective program, and use of more flexible financing instruments. After the
introduction, section II covers CAS program performance, section III evaluates the Bank’s performance,
while section IV, highlights key lessons learned and suggestions for the new CPS.
B. Summary of performance
4.
CAS outcomes are rated as satisfactory. Across a broad range of engagement areas, the CAS
program achieved results in line with expectations. The Bank’s program of ongoing portfolio of projects,
new lending, program of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), policy advice, Technical Assistance
(TA) Trust Funds, IFC investments and advisory services, and MIGA guarantees achieved the stated CAS
objectives and assisted the government to meet its goals. The CAS made significant progress towards all
expected outcomes, achieving eighteen (18) out of twenty two (22) stated outcome indicators. Only one
outcome indicator was not achieved while the rest were either mostly achieved or partially achieved.
Nonetheless, a few areas such as capacity building within Government and the private sector and slow
implementation of regional projects remained a challenge. The capacity building filter and Minimum

Integrated Trade Expansion Program (MITEP) TA program were not achieved, while support for
economic and financial analysis of public investments has not been significant. These limitations,
notwithstanding, the CAS achieved almost all set objectives.
5.
The World Bank Group performance in designing and managing implementation of the
CAS program is rated as superior. The program was designed under the core principles of alignment
with the country’s development goals, high selectivity, good identification of critical risks and mitigation
measures, increased coordination within the WBG and with other development partners, strong results
framework, and appropriate interventions. The Bank closely supervised the program—with 57% of Task
Team Leaders based in the Country Office—ensuring quality of new and ongoing operations,
disseminating knowledge services, and adequately responding to the country’s changing needs and
priorities.
6.
The WBG program was well aligned with the country’s priorities stated in its EDPRS and
remained almost as planned at CASPR. Implementation was sensitive to the country context, while at
the same time accommodative of changing circumstances such as the food and global financial crises. In
this respect, Rwanda accessed funding under the Global Food Price Response Program and the Crisis
Response Window. The Bank responded promptly and effectively to unexpected events such as the aid
shock in FY13. The use of programmatic Development Policy Lending (DPL) operations, as the main
lending instrument, enabled enough flexibility to the country in the way it allocated its resources to
priority sectors in order to meet set development targets. In addition, it helped to foster better donor
coordination, improved harmonization, and reinforced support for the country’s reform program among
the different budget support donors. The International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s engagement
maintained a strategic focus on the quality of the business environment and finance, while the Multilateral
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provided political risk insurance guarantees to private foreign investors in the
energy sector, financial sector, and agribusiness.
7.
Delivery improved with a shorter lag between Board approval and effectiveness, mainly
through Additional Financing (AF) and DPL operations, but slow implementation still remains an
issue (as reflected in the Skills Development Project, Governance for Competitiveness TA Project,
Transport Sector Development Project and most of the regional projects). The Bank continues to be one
of Rwanda’s key development partners (DPs) delivering results across a broad range of engagement areas
in collaboration with other donors.
C. Progress made towards achievement of Rwanda’s development objectives
8.
Rwanda’s long term development objectives are articulated in its Vision 2020. The objective
of Rwanda Vision 2020 is to become a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita)23 operating as
a knowledge-based services hub by 2020. The medium term strategy (EDPRS) assigned the highest
priority to accelerating growth to create employment and generate exports. It was framed around three
strategic flagship programs 24 : (i) growth; (ii) Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP), and (iii)
governance. The flagship on growth targeted economy-wide improvements in productivity. Its goal is to
transform Rwanda’s economy from subsistence agriculture towards an increase in commercial
agriculture, as well as manufacturing and services. VUP focuses on ensuring growth is shared by creating
economic opportunities for the poorest Rwandans. It has three components: (i) public works, (ii) credit
packages, and (iii) direct supports. The governance flagship seeks to strengthen political and economic
governance, and build institutions and capacity of the state. It envisages a wide range of reforms to

Rwanda, over the last decade, has delivered a “triple crown”—posting robust growth,
substantially cutting poverty, and reducing inequality. During CAS preparation, it was noted that
Rwanda had fully exhausted the growth effects of its post conflict reconstruction and growth had slowed.
It needed a much higher development path in order to put its long term development aspirations within
reach, projecting required annual average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 8 percent against
an estimate of 6 percent in 2007. Five years later, Rwanda registered impressive progress. Average real
growth was slightly over 8 percent; household consumption per adult-equivalent grew at 2.5 percent per
annum and was stronger for the poor than for the non-poor; the poverty headcount was cut by 12
percentage-points over the last five years to reach 45 percent in 2011; and inequality dropped, with the
Gini measure down from 0.52 to 0.49. Social indicators have improved—child mortality dropped by twothirds, primary school completion rates tripled to 79 percent, and enrollment in primary school is just shy
of universal.
10.
More than a million people have been lifted out of poverty. Rwanda experienced one of the
most exciting and fastest periods of growth and socio-economic progress over the last ten years; it was
one of the ten fastest growing economies in the world during the 2000 decade25. More than a million
people were lifted out of poverty, population growth is stabilizing, and the country is making significant
progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and middle income status. The
triple crown of sustained economic growth (8 percent average), poverty reduction (12 percent), and a
reduction in income inequality (0.03) was achieved over the first EDPRS period.
11.
Remarkable socio-economic progress was achieved during the first EDPRS period.
Economic activity was driven by a large increase in agricultural output, increase in prices of Rwanda’s
main exports, and strong domestic demand financed through development assistance. Rwanda remained
relatively insulated from the slowdown in the advanced economies. Though inflation rose sharply in
2011, it has still remained in single digit and has been the lowest among East Africa Community (EAC)
countries. In 2012, high growth was sustained and inflation remained relatively modest, although risks
from instability in commodity prices and aid flows remain.
12.
An outstanding performance in improvements to the investment climate as measured by
Doing Business (DB). Combined with sound policies for macroeconomic stability, Rwanda made
impressive improvements to its investment climate, especially from 2005 to present. The World Bank
Doing Business publication recognized Rwanda as one of the top ten reforming countries in the world in
its 2006 and 2011 reports and as the global top reformer in 2010—ahead of countries like the United Arab
Emirates and Columbia. In that year, Rwanda’s overall ease of Doing Business ranking jumped an
unprecedented seventy-two places, from 139 to 67. The improvements continued, and in the latest report,
Doing Business 2014, Rwanda ranked 32nd globally from 52nd in DB 2013. Rwanda’s investment climate,
as measured by the Doing Business report compares overwhelmingly better than its EAC neighbors:
Tanzania (145th), Burundi (140th), Uganda (132nd), and Kenya (129th).
13.
In spite of the impressive achievements made during the first EDPRS period, significant
development challenges still remain. Though significantly reduced, head count and extreme poverty
remain high and persistent, particularly in rural areas. According to the third Integrated Household Living
Condition Survey (EICV III), 2012, poverty in rural areas still stands at 48.7 percent compared to 22.1

25

World Development Indicators, 2012

49

percent in urban areas. Moreover, there are significant variations in poverty reduction across the country
with the poorest district having 73 percent of its population living below the poverty line26. Women are
more affected by poverty than men, and inequality continues to be comparatively high.
14.
Given the extent of reforms, investment has responded insufficiently. Domestic entry has
surged, while foreign investment has been stunted. Small local businesses reacted very positively to
business environment, in terms of entry into the market. Foreign and domestic private investments in
Rwanda have not met expectations that come with improvements in the business environment. Indeed,
comparing private sector’s gross fixed capital formation (GFCF-private) between Rwanda and its peers
shows that investment in Rwanda has been moderate. GFCF-private has increased by 3.8 percent points
as a share of GDP between 2004 and 2011, and on average by 0.5 percentage points annually27.
15.
Private sector growth and competitiveness is constrained by low skills and labour
productivity across all sectors of the economy, and structural transformation constrained by key
infrastructure gaps. Lack of skills is a particular issue to large firms with more than 100 employees (45
percent of which reported inadequate educated workforce as a constraint in 2011). The 2009 National
Skills Audit reported an average 61.5 percent skills deficit and severe skills gap in the private sector in
Rwanda. The most significant infrastructure constraint to firms of all sizes is electricity which is costly,
even by EAC regional comparison (at $0.24/kWh compared to $0.17/kWh in Uganda, $0.15/kWh in
Kenya, and $0.05kWh in Tanzania). Whereas generation has doubled from installed capacity of 55MW in
2007 to 110MW currently, it is still much less than the anticipated minimum demand of 563MW in the
medium term. In addition, Rwanda’s internal trade and competitiveness of exports are constrained by high
transport costs and an insufficient logistics system that has not grown in parallel with the increasing
demand to trade. For example, according to the report on Doing Business in the East Africa Community
2012, an exporter from Rwanda pays US$3,275 to transport a container of cargo to the port. This
compares to US$2,965 in Burundi, US$2,880 in Uganda, US$2,055 in Kenya, and US$1,255 in Tanzania.
Importers pay US$4,990 to transport a container from the port compared to US$4,855, US$3,015,
US$2,190, and US$1,430 in Burundi, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, respectively. Among others,
Rwanda still faces challenges of high aid dependence and the risk of high unemployment, especially
among the youth.
II. CAS Program Performance
A. Overview
16.
This section covers CAS program performance. The evaluation, summarized in Annex 1, is
based on the outcomes and indicators as updated in CASPR, 2011, and highlights the effectiveness of the
CAS in achieving its stated objectives. It states key achievements under each CAS outcome, crosscutting issues, and ends with an overall assessment.
17.
The CAS sought, primarily, to contribute to the first objective of significantly raising
growth and creating jobs. A secondary objective was to consolidate specific elements of Rwanda’s
social progress by tackling selected aspects of social vulnerability. It focused on two strategic themes: (i)
promoting Rwanda’s economic transformation for sustainable growth and (ii) decreasing social
vulnerability. It was results-based and included twenty three (23) monitoring indicators and forty one (41)
milestones. Updates made at CASPR left twenty two (22) outcome indicators and thirty nine (39)

milestones28. Progress made in terms of achieving the CAS outcomes are described (in part B) below,
following a brief assessment of the role played by DPL operations, non-lending TA, and aid effectiveness.
18.
The DPL operations played a key role in terms of the focus areas and the policy actions they
supported. The need to substantially raise the GDP growth rate and reduce social vulnerability were key
objectives of the DPLs, each of which had linkages to at least one CAS outcome. The Poverty Reduction
Support Financing (PRSF 4-8) supported the EDPRS flagship programs on growth and governance, while
a companion series of three DPLs—the Community Living Standards Grants/Credits (CLSG/Cs)—
supported the VUP with a focus on social protection and the health sector and improving service delivery
to the poorest and most vulnerable. Specific programs supported under the growth flagship program were:
(i) enhancing the skills of the population including through a shift away from Technical and Vocational
Education Training (TVET) to Post-Basic Education (PBE); (ii) increasing access to infrastructure
services, specifically energy, water, and transport through (a) improving cost-effective and operational
efficiency in the energy sector; (b) developing a framework for integrated and sustainable management
of water resources; (iii) increasing rural road access by improving the condition of the classified district
road network; (iv) raising agricultural productivity and production; and (v) broadening and deepening the
financial sector. Under Governance: (i) strengthening the public financial system and its management at
the central and local levels; (ii) improving the capacity and transparency of procurement methods; (iii)
pursuing implementation of budget and fiscal decentralization reforms; (iv) deepening civil service
reforms and incentives to build skills and retention. The CLSG/C program supported the Government of
Rwanda’s social protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme poverty, initially in 30
pilot Sectors29, and to expand access to high-impact health, nutrition, and population interventions at the
community level. The program also helped Rwanda integrate international good practice within its
poverty-reducing policies.
19.
The implementation completion and results reports (ICRs) for the second PRSF series
(PRSF 4-7) and the CLSG/C series rated achievement of their development objectives as
satisfactory. The PRSFs had highly satisfactory performance with respect to implementation and
outcomes, as well as the overall relevance of the operations. The CLSG/C program fully achieved its
development objectives. Significant results were achieved in reducing maternal and child mortality, and
reducing the total fertility rate through increased use of family planning, which should lead to further
progress in poverty reduction in future. According to the fourth Demographic and Health Survey, 2010,
maternal mortality reduced from 750 per 100,000 lives in 2005 to 476 in 2010; 98% of pregnant women
received prenatal care, up from 94% in 2005; the percentage of deliveries assisted by skilled providers
increased from 39% to 69%, and the percentage of deliveries in health facilities increased from 30% to
69% over the same period. The proportion of married women using a modern method of contraceptive
increased from 35% in 2007/08 to 45% in 2010/11, and total fertility rate for women aged 15-49 for the
three years preceding the survey dropped from 6.1 in 2005 to 4.6 in 2010. The social protection sector has
significantly evolved, with strong achievements in policy development. Community health reforms have
also been deepened and further developed.
20.
Through the various DPLs, harmonization and collaboration with other development
partners was also enhanced under the CAS, in particular through mechanisms such as (i) the Common
Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) developed with the Government and other development
partners to harmonize budget support and the related dialogue; and (ii) the preparation of Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAps) particularly in the sectors where the Bank was a lead donor (energy and agriculture).

28

One indicator (i.e. on rural access) was dropped at CASPR–since the operation supporting it would be slipped to beyond the
CAS period–and a new proposed new outcome was not developed. Two milestones were dropped. See Annex 1
29

A Sector is an administrative unit below a district.

51

21.
Provision of knowledge products and playing key leadership roles have been at the center of
the WBG operations. The Bank has provided non-lending TA (NLTA) and undertaken economic and
sector work (ESW) to underpin its operations. Regular macroeconomic monitoring through the Rwanda
Economic Update (REU) is closely linked to the flagship program on growth. The Bank’s leadership role
has been particularly significant in advancing policy dialogue between the Government of Rwanda and
other development partners such as through the Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG); Joint
Budget Support Reviews (JBSRs); co-chairing (together with government) sector working groups
(SWGs) of agriculture, energy, public finance management (PFM), and capacity building and
employment; and participating in other SWGs.
22.
The Bank has played a key role in shaping the aid effectiveness agenda over the years and is
a major champion of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action. The Bank maintained a
country-driven development model enabling the mainstreaming of aid effectiveness principles at the
country level—by aligning CAS with the EDPRS, results-driven strategies, use of country systems (in
PFM), and mutual accountability. Enhancing quality and effectiveness of aid continues to be of
significant importance to Rwanda’s development agenda. The progress made in the area of the Single
Project Implementation Units (SPIUs), Project Treasury Single Account (TSA), as well as other
institutional capacity strengthening such as public financial reform has facilitated the increased use of
country systems by development partners. Rwanda is indeed recognized globally as one of the countries
that utilize and manage aid effectively. The confidence in Rwanda’s systems and commitments to reform
was evident in the increased volume of budget support to approximately US$390 million in FY12 from
US$278 million in FY11.
B. Progress by strategic engagement theme/pillar (towards CAS outcomes)
23.
The CAS was framed around five outcomes under the two strategic themes. The outcomes
were: (i) agriculture production–particularly for food crops–sustainably raised, (ii) improved access to
and quality of key infrastructure services, (iii) improved environment for sound private sector
development, (iv) capacity to manage public resources–at central and local levels–strengthened, and (v)
significant health and social risks–to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion in Rwanda–are mitigated
24.
Overall, progress towards achievement of CAS outcomes has been very strong. Eighteen (82
percent) of the specified CAS outcome indicators were achieved, two outcome indicators (9 percent) were
mostly achieved, one (4.5 percent) was partially achieved, and one (4.5 percent) was not achieved.
Progress on the milestones has also been strong with 77 percent achieved, 3 percent mostly achieved, 15
percent partially achieved, and 5 percent not achieved. When reviewed in terms of achievement of, or
progress towards the results specified in the CASPR matrix, performance was strongest in raising
agriculture productivity, access to electricity, and reducing social vulnerability (Table 1).

Promoting Rwanda’s Economic Transformation for Sustained Growth
CAS Outcome 1.1: Agricultural production–particularly for food crops–sustainably raised - Achieved
25.
Support focused on increasing agricultural productivity and commercialization. Given that
85 percent of Rwandan working adults work in agriculture, increasing agricultural productivity and
commercializing production would be critical to achieving Rwanda’s development goals. In this respect,
the World Bank embarked on the investment lending support first using a three phased Adaptable
Program Loan (APL), the Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP) that has focused on intensifying
production in the marshlands, since 2001. This was followed by the Land Husbandry, Water Harvesting
and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) Project that started in 2010 and focuses on increasing productivity on
hillsides and developing parts of these hillsides for irrigated horticulture production. The CAS placed
strong emphasis on use of sustainable approaches to increase agriculture productivity, and the RSSP—
then in the first year of its second phase—was a key instrument for delivery. RSSP 2’s sound project
design and effective implementation—involving marshland rehabilitation (an additional 3,324 ha of
irrigated marshland)30, hillside development (benefitting 10,000 ha), and the creation and strengthening of
81 cooperatives—created positive synergies between project components. RSSP 2 would continue to
expand irrigated area in cultivated marshlands and increase the use of sustainable land management
(SLM) practices. SLM would further be supported through the Integrated Management of Critical
Ecosystem Project (IMCEP), the regional Lake Victoria Environment Management Project (LVEMP) and

30
This also included construction of 8 dams, 164 km of primary canals, 160 km of secondary canals, 70 km of drainage canals,
and 44 km of access roads.

53

the multi-partner platform provided by TerrAfrica, which would be used to carry out analytical work to
support Government of Rwanda in developing a programmatic investment framework for SLM.
26.
Marshlands have been rehabilitated; hillsides developed; and yields of maize, rice, and
potato improved. Since the beginning of RSSP 1 in 2001, over 6,500 hectares of marshlands have been
rehabilitated or developed, and nearly 26,000 hectares of hillsides have been sustainably developed. Over
the CAS period, maize yields have improved from 1.6 tons/ha to nearly 5.0 tons/ha; while rice yields have
improved from 3.0 tons/ha to 6.30 tons/ha; and potato yields have improved from 7.0 tons/ha to nearly 20
tons/ha. In addition, a number of rural infrastructures have been built to link productive areas to markets.
Project implementation (RSSP 2), was and (RSSP 3) continues to be highly satisfactory, leading to key
achievements in marshland rehabilitation, hillside development, and strengthening of agricultural
cooperatives. Several enabling factors led to these accomplishments, even given the initial delays
resulting from exogenous factors. The RSSP 2 target was significantly exceeded (18,675 tons vs. 11,194
tons, by 167 percent). The main drivers of this significant increase in rice production were the project’s
marshland investments, which regulated and increased the water supply and permitted two cropping
seasons, and the project’s “software” support, including provision of appropriate intensification
technologies and improved inputs.
27.
A number of direct beneficiaries—also disaggregated by gender—have benefited from the
two projects. So far, of the 57,000 people who benefited from the first two RSSP series, 42 percent are
females as are 48 percent of the 19,828 people who have benefited from the LWH. The impact created by
these two programs is creating transformation in rural Rwanda. Results from the 2010-11 household
survey clearly indicate that the reported poverty reduction of 12% between 2005-06 and 2010-11 and the
corresponding more than one million pulled out of poverty are mainly attributed in part to improved
agriculture production, increased number of agro businesses, and increased farm wage employment.
28.
Implementation of the IMCEP led to improved ecosystem management interventions and
establishment of a coordination mechanism. The IMCEP promoted the adoption of ecosystem
management interventions through capacity strengthening, the formulation and implementation of
community-based integrated ecosystems management plans (watershed management plans and wetland
catchment management plans). At the time of project closure, in June 2011, an inter-ministerial
committee had been established as a mechanism for marshland coordination. In addition, four watershed
management plans had been prepared, against two originally targeted.
29.
Through its strong leadership in the sector, the Bank has played a key role in providing
technical assistance and policy advice. It helped refine the design of the LWH and was able to
leverage— and administers— resources from other donors to support the program: (i) Global Agriculture
and Food Security Program-GAFSP ($50 million), United States Agency for International DevelopmentUSAID ($12.5 million), and (iii) Canadian International Development Agency-CIDA ($8 million).
30.
Sustainable intensification technologies have been adopted. Whereas limited support for SLM
was received from TerrAfrica, farmers in RSSP2 and LWH targeted areas have adopted sustainable
marshland or hillside intensification technologies. According to the Impact Assessment survey (2012), 98
percent of the beneficiary farmers had adopted at least two improved sustainable technologies 31 by
October 2012. The LVEMP is having implementation capacity challenges and no significant
achievements have been made yet.
31
Adoption of sustainable intensification technologies is defined for the purpose of the RSSP as adoption of at least two of the
following practices: soil fertility management (including appropriate use of organic and/or inorganic fertilizer), integrated pest
management (IPM), conservation tillage, contour bunding, construction of erosion control structures including terraces,
vegetation strips, and agroforestry practices.

54

CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved access to and quality of key economic infrastructure services - Achieved
31.
Electricity generation has doubled. The World Bank’s supported Urgent Electricity
Rehabilitation Project (UERP) focused on helping improve Rwanda’s electricity generation capacities.
Accordingly, the 20 MW Heavy Fuel Power Plant in Jabana, became operational in May 2009. This plant,
together with other domestic and regional hydro plants, constitute the back-bone of the Rwandan
electricity supply and has enabled the government to eliminate load shedding and phase-out part of the
rental diesel generators with maintained supply quality. Energy generation has doubled from installed
capacity of 55MW in 2007 to 110MW currently.
32.
Electricity access has also doubled from 6 percent in 2009 to 13 percent in 2012. The UERP
was followed by support for an electricity rollout program—the Rwanda’s Electricity Access Rollout
Program (EARP) —whose objective is to increase the number of households connected to the electricity
grid to 350,000 by 2013 from the initial 110,000 in 2009. The EARP is implemented in a sector-wide
approach (SWAp) with the assistance of Energy Sector Management Assistance Program’s Africa
Renewable Energy Access (AFREA) Program, since 2009. The number of customers so far connected
had increased to about 332,000 households (13 percent national coverage) by December 2012, the third
year of the program implementation. The electrification program helped to bring benefits in rural areas
such as improved lighting thereby extending the number of working hours and reduced spoilage of fresh
products due to availability of refrigeration and cooling. Rural electrification also greatly contributed to
improved service delivery, especially in health, education, and administrative offices.
33.
Emphasis is now returning to increasing generation capacity. The Sustainable Energy
Development Project provides advisory and technical support, including micro hydropower feasibility
studies. The IFC has provided loans to the private developers, and MIGA has provided a guarantee to the
25MW Kivuwatt methane plant. The Energy SWAp is in place and the twining between Electrogaz
(Electricity, Water and Sanitation Authority –EWSA) and the Tunisian Utility STEG was successfully
concluded.
34.
Under transport, rehabilitation of the Kigali-Ruhengeri road was completed in September
2012 and provisional hand over to the Government of Rwanda was made. IDA provided an
additional $11 million to cover cost overruns. Completion of rehabilitation of this road is of significant
functional/commercial importance because it is part of the Northern Corridor (and integrates into the
transport infrastructure of the East African network) and is an integral part of the EDPRS with the
potential to generate sustained employment through periodic or routine road maintenance works. The
regional East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project has experienced excessively long
implementation delays due to safeguard issues on the Rwandan side of the border at Gatuna and a risk of
cancellation is still inevitable if no significant progress is made. Access within Kigali, Huye and Musanze
was improved. The East Africa Road Network Project (FY10) was not delivered and there has been
limited Bank engagement on the regional rail project being spearheaded by Africa Development Bank
(AfDB). The Rural Roads Project was slipped to FY14 due, in part, to extended discussions with
Government of Rwanda over wider design standards (with inherent safeguard issues) it had enacted,
earlier in the project preparation process.
35.
The eRwanda Project supported several studies 32 which became the foundation and
accelerated preparation of the Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP). Approval
of RCIP, on September 30, 2008, promptly corresponded with the launch of international submarine
fiber-optic cables in East Africa (EASSy, TEAM, SEACOM) and terrestrial fiber-optic backbone
32

Study on National Connectivity Options”

55

networks (from the Rwandan national backbone to the submarine cable points in Mombasa and Dar es
Salaam). Under an enabling environment, several advisory contracts have been completed and others are
underway. Advisory work on interconnection and infrastructure-sharing has been completed and the
results have been implemented in regulatory decisions, which are expected to have significant positive
impacts in the sector. This work was implemented in response to direct requests from the Government
and has met the client's needs. RCIP support has also funded in-house advisory and technical support on
ICT, broadband, and e-Government. The primary output under connectivity was the pre-purchase of
capacity for the Government and thereby strengthening the overall broadband connectivity for Rwanda.
Significant progress has been made and some work has also been undertaken in connecting district offices
with local area networks (LANs). However, the roll-out of broadband services and supply of broadband
connectivity to institutions has been delayed by the Government since its broadband access network
strategy has not yet been finalized.
CAS Outcome 1.3: Improved environment for private sector development – Achieved
36.
Improved perception of the investment climate. With Bank support under the Competitiveness
and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP), a total of 13 commercial laws33 were reviewed, finalized
and enacted. The project enabled the creation of three fully functional commercial courts and an
Arbitration Centre to settle business disputes and reduce the time taken to enforce court decisions. The
time taken to settle a commercial dispute in the Commercial Court was decreased from 394 days in 2003
to 230 days in 2011. The high success rate in legislative reform could not be totally attributed to the
project as some of the reforms pertaining to Doing Business indicators were, as from 2008, also funded
by the IFC Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Project (RICRP). As a consequence, the time and cost to
set up a business significantly decreased and Rwanda was ranked 8th globally in the 2012 Doing Business
Report in the ‘Starting a Business’ indicator. The CEDP funded the Doing Business Reform Unit and
paved the way for the IFC RICRP in terms of legislative and investment promotion reforms.
37.
The performance of the banking and non-banking sectors was improved. Access to financial
services was enhanced through improved service delivery of private commercial banks, micro finance
institutions (MFIs), and new financial products such as leasing were introduced. CEDP’s initial financing
contributed to the improvement of the quality of services offered by the financial sector in Rwanda. The
main achievements include: (i) improvement of the portfolio management of Rwanda Commercial Bank
(BCR) after its privatization process; (ii) a better performing Popular Bank of Rwanda (UBPR) after its
restructuring and recapitalization; (iii) introduction of a new chart of accounts for the banking sector; (iv)
a Credit Reference bureau; (v) the successful implementation of the Automated Clearing House (ACH)
and Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS); and (iv) regular on site and off site supervision of
commercial banks and MFIs, including saving and credit cooperatives (SACCOs). All banks now comply
with the minimum capital requirement of US$ 8.6 million and required minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio
of 15 percent. There is now a more efficient banking system in Rwanda and the performance of the nonbanking sector also improved.
38.
The CEDP significantly contributed to improve the perception of Rwanda as an investment
destination. Through the reforms in the business environment, financial sector, and public utilities, the
CEDP helped improve investor perceptions on Rwanda. It also supported investment promotion
campaigns to attract foreign investors in Rwanda. The share of private investment to GDP increased from
33

The legislations are: (1) Law establishing commercial courts, (2) Law on Arbitration, Mediation and Conciliation in
Commercial Matters, (3) Law Establishing the Business Registration Services Agency, (4) Labor code, (5) Law on mortgages,
(6) Law on securities in movable property, (7) Insolvency law, (8) Companies acts, (9) Competition and Consumer Protection
Law, (10) Draft bill on Provisions applicable on Privately Financed infrastructures, (11) Contract Law, (12) Condominium Law;
(13) Law on electronic transactions. The 14th which is Negotiable Instruments Law has not yet been enacted

56

7 percent in July 2008 to 10.2 percent by end 2012.34 Export of goods and services continued to grow
over the CAS period, except for 2009 (due in part to the financial crisis) and were 14.3 percent of GDP by
end 2012. Note, however, that the Minimum Integrated Trade Expansion Program (MITEP) was
cancelled at Government’s request.
39.
The project financed the establishment and strengthening of the capacity of several
institutions in Rwanda. Support was given to the judiciary, regulatory bodies, institutions providing
support to enterprises and SMEs, banks including the Central Bank, specialized training schools,
investment promotion and facilitation agencies, and the Private Sector Federation. The knowledge and
experience gained by the beneficiaries through CEDP should contribute to sustain the reforms and even
deepen the reforms in the business environment and financial services sector.
40.
To ensure the sustainability of investment climate reforms, the Government continues to
finance the Doing Business unit which was created under Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to
oversee Rwanda’s performance with regard to the IFC-World Bank Doing Business indicators. The
Bank’s current operation—Governance for Competitiveness TA Project—contributes to sustaining the
achievements of the previous project through continued support to selected government agencies in the
areas of export diversification and competitiveness for the horticulture and tourism sectors. The special
economic zone (SEZ) is an additional activity supported by the WBG which is geared to promote the
industrial sector as well as ease access to land and utility services.
41.
IFC, MIGA, and World Bank activities strategically complemented each other particularly
in the private sector development and energy sectors. IFC has been involved in improving the
country’s private investments through advisory services and investments, with its strategy focused on
improving the investment climate; building the capacity of SMEs and micro enterprises; and supporting
development of projects in the financial, tourism, food processing, and infrastructure sectors. IFC made
investments in a number of areas including: energy; construction and real estate; food and beverages;
accommodation and tourism services; and finance and insurance. IFC also provided a local currency
SWAP facility to the National Bank of Rwanda to provide up to $50 million local currency equivalent for
long term financing (up to 7 years) of projects in Rwandan Francs.
42.
IFC’s Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Program supported reforms to improve the
regulatory environment, build institutions, and attract private sector participation in key sectors.
The main achievement is the improvement of Rwanda’s Doing Business ranking; moving from being
among the top five reformers in sub-Saharan Africa in Doing Business 2009 to the world top reformer in
2010 and second top reformer in 2011. Rwanda has since continued to perform exceptionally well. The
Rwanda Entrepreneurship Development Program supported SME competitiveness through building
capacity, creating linkages with larger firms, and promoting stronger entrepreneurship among the youth
and women. It facilitated the establishment of a privately owned SME Solutions Center, which provided
incubation facilities for up to 32 businesses in partnership with Raizcorp, a South Africa-based successful
incubation model. IFC also provided Infrastructure Advisory Services for the development of a public
private partnership (PPP) to support a 25,000 m3/day plant for bulk water supply to Kigali City.
43.
MIGA provided guarantees for improvements in Rwanda’s financial sector including
helping to: (i) improve retail banking services and functionality in areas such as accepting international
VISA cards; (ii) satisfy capital adequacy requirements laid down by the National Bank of Rwanda; (iii)
increase the number of ATMs in use in Rwanda; (iv) define a card strategy that incorporates the use of
national ID cards as credit/debit cards; and (v) strengthen lending to SMEs and facilitate equity

investments in greenfield projects that are seen as central to Rwanda’s growth. It also provided a
guarantee to a methane gas to power project.
CAS Outcome 1.4: Management of public resources at central and local levels strengthened- Mostly
Achieved.
44.
Improved public financial management. The Bank’s supported Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (PSCBP) financed a range of technical assistance, consultancies, and equipment to
support the Government’s public finance management (PFM) and procurement reforms. The PFM
Reform Coordinator and staff of the PFM secretariat were financed through the PSCBP. The
development of the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) blueprint and the
rollout of IFMIS, supporting software and hardware, and IFMIS training were also supported by the
project. Training was provided for government accountants in all budget agencies on how to produce
financial reports, and consolidated statements. This led to an increase in the number of agencies that
complete annual financial reports from a low of 16% of government ministries, departments and agencies
(MDAs) in 2008 to 75% of MDAs submitting timely reports by end of 2011. Procurement coaches were
recruited to train staff in strategic Ministries such as MINIFRA, MINEDUC and MINISANTE to improve
the management of high value contracts.
45.
Improved accountability and efficiency of human resources. Wages and salaries constitute a
significant portion of the Government budget, and are estimated at 12.7 percent of Government
expenditure. In this regard, the rollout of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll system (IPPS) financed by
the PSCBP is an integral element in improving accountability and transparency. The IPPS has helped to
minimize the risk of ghost workers. PSCBP support for upgrading the IPPIS on pay, leave, promotion,
and termination has allowed the Government to ensure that wages and salaries are captured accurately,
potential manual entry errors or data manipulations are eliminated, and matches with data captured in the
IFMIS systems managed by the PFM Secretariat in MINECOFIN. The project also formalized the IPPIS
user group and trained 282 members from public institutions on how to use the IPPIS. The training
included Human Resource Directors, Directors of planning and IT officers. At the close of the project in
December 2011, 55 out of 94 (58.5%) public institutions were integrated into the IPPIS. A quality
assurance review of the IPPIS was also done and validated.
46.
The roll out of the citizen charters and service directories supported by the project is aimed
at improving accountability and responsiveness of Government to citizens. The work on the citizen
charters began under the original PSCBP and was carried over into the restructured project. A total of
sixty (60) Citizen Charters have been rolled out in English and Kinyarwanda and posted on MDA
websites, exceeding the target of fifty five (55).
47.
The project provided support for the development of the Rwanda Public Sector Pay and
Retention Policy and Implementation Strategy, as well as the situational and cost benefit analysis
that inform the policy. The strategy was adopted by Cabinet in January 2012. The policy aims to address
the structural issues of public service pay policy priorities and the critical issue of staff turnover in the
public service, which have been continuously identified as an obstacle to achieving the Government’s
development objectives. Implementation of the pay policy covers the period 2011/12 – 2017/18. Of
critical importance is that the policy allowed the Government to improve the wages of public teachers,
which have been an obstacle to the attainment of education outcomes as poorly paid teachers are less
motivated.
48.
The Public Sector Management Strategy 2012-17 has been developed and approved by
Cabinet. The Bank supported updating of the Strategy as well as the development of the Human
Resource Management and Development Policy. The policy was reviewed in November 2011 during a

58

leadership workshop with representatives of the ministry of public service and labour (MIFOTRA). An
administrative procedures manual for public servants was developed under the project and made available
in two versions; French and English.
49.
Support for capacity building in economic and financial analysis has been constrained by
slow project implementation. Moreover, the continued existence of serious capacity constraints across
sectors/projects (and amidst a number of efforts to address them) has highlighted the difficulties of
capturing, measuring, and aggregating data about successful capacity building efforts. However, the
establishment of a Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat by Government and supported by the
PSCBP has assisted in coordinating and mainstreaming capacity building into government and donor
programmes.
Decrease Social Vulnerability
CAS Outcome 1.5: Significant health and social risks–to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion in
Rwanda–are mitigated - Achieved
50.
Strengthened national social protection system to cushion vulnerable families from shocks.
Through the Support to Social Protection System (SSPS) series of operations and drawing on lesson from
its predecessor, the Community Living Standards series, the World Bank has helped to expand the Vision
2020 Umurenge Program (VUP)—the Government’s main safety net program—to cover 43 percent of the
country’s 416 geographical sectors in 2012, up from just 7 percent when it was launched in 2008. The
number of poor people benefiting from the program has grown from less than 10,000 to over half a
million in the same period. In addition, the SSPS operations have been critical to helping Government
enhance the effectiveness and increase coverage of its overall social protection systems by supporting
establishment and improvement of key areas like the impact evaluation, targeting effectiveness, the
management information system, and the harmonization and coordination of the main programs.
51.
The SSPS program expansion is also gender sensitive consistent with the Government
policy on family and gender promotion. Under the VUP, 68 percent of households which benefit from
cash transfers are women headed households, while 46 percent of participants in public works are women.
52.
A number of ex-combatants and armed group members were demobilized and reintegrated.
Through the Demobilization and Reintegration Program, all 26,585 ex-combatants under the Rwandan
Defense Forces and 10,640 Armed Group members had been demobilized and reintegrated by November
2012 and a total of 7,282 reintegration grants were provided between 2009 and 2012.
C. Cross-cutting
53.
Crosscutting issues of gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, etc. did not feature prominently in
the CAS. It was assumed that they would be mainstreamed into individual (project) operations. More
broadly, teams prepared strategies for integrating these issues into their operations for instance in
agriculture (RSSP/LWH) a gender action plan was developed, while a gender strategy and a HIV/AIDS
strategy were developed under the Transport Sector Development Project to guide inclusion of these
issues into investments in the transport sector in the country.
D. Overall CAS Assessment.
54.
Overall, program performance is rated as satisfactory. The program achieved almost all the
stated CAS objectives and assisted the government to achieve its goals. It had exceptional development
impacts in increasing agriculture output, access to electricity, and support for social protection programs.
There were no major shortcomings and no violations of safeguard issues were identified in the program.

59

III. Evaluating Bank Performance
55.
This section evaluates Bank performance. It looks at (i) CAS design and (ii) CAS
implementation. Among other things, it covers relevance of CAS objectives and their alignment with
country development objectives; design of WBG interventions for achieving CAS objectives (including
selection of areas of engagement and instruments, adequacy and appropriateness of interventions,
consistency between financing and AAA, synergy across WBG, and consideration of other development
partners’ programs); strength of the results framework; and identification of critical risks and their
mitigation measures. It also looks at quality of supervision (including managing program risk and quality
of the portfolio); quality of preparation of new projects and AAA; relevance, quality and dissemination of
AAA; responsiveness to changing country circumstances, priorities and demands; WBG efforts for
improving coordination with other development partners; and attention to safeguard and fiduciary issues.
A. CAS Design
56.
The CAS was aligned with the EDPRS, was highly selective, and focused on increased donor
harmonization. The CAS supported implementation of the EDPRS and its results framework was
directly aligned with EDPRS development outcomes. The support program was prepared in a highly
consultative manner involving government, other development partners, private sector, and civil society
organizations. It focused Bank engagement on EDPRS areas, primarily growth and selected social areas.
It supported progress on MDGs 1 on poverty and hunger; as well as MDG 4 on child mortality; and MDG
5 on maternal mortality. Under the second theme, support was targeted to public works and direct
assistance and health program focused on community health focusing on child and maternal mortality
risks, and demobilization and reintegration. The selectivity was based on the Government of Rwanda’s
preference for the Bank’s engagement. It significantly reduced areas where the WBG provides support,
with no new IDA financing in a number of sectors 35 where other donors were already engaged or
expected to contribute financing, for better harmonization of donor support. Selectivity was further
confirmed when, in July 2010, the Government finalized a division of labor (DoL) exercise, which aimed
to limit each development partner’s investment operations to three sectors. The DoL confirmed the
Bank’s priority engagement in three sectors—agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT)—as well
as some cross-sector areas.
57.
Jointly prepared by the WBG and more targeted within the areas of intervention. The
design sought to draw on synergies within the WBG and catalyze higher volumes of private sector
resources to support Rwanda’s development. IFC was to continue its focus on supporting Government of
Rwanda to improve the investment climate; build the capacity of micro, small and medium enterprises;
and support development of projects with high impact in the financial, tourism, agribusiness, and
infrastructure sectors. MIGA’s increasing role was expected to grow with guarantees in the micro finance,
financial, and energy sectors.
58.
The design involved increasing the use of development policy lending (DPL), which was in
line with the Rwanda’s aid policy and the country’s good performance. The annual PRSG (budget
support) would remain the main DPL instrument. Through the DPL instrument, the Bank would support
efforts to strengthen capacity to design reforms and programs, to implement them effectively, to monitor
their impact and feed results into further policy and program refinement. Capacity building was planned
to be interwoven through the entire CAS program through the application of the “Capacity Building
Filter”. The filter would include measures to help build public sector capacity and strengthen the
participation of civil society in development. It would be used to streamline capacity building efforts into
all Bank operations and analytic work.

Primary education, water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, urban development and public service reform.

59.
Investment Project Financing was envisaged to be used much less, mainly for delivering
large infrastructure including regional programs and areas where IDA financing would help
leverage additional resources. Analytic and advisory activities (AAA) and technical assistance (TA)
services would be used more strategically to complement financial operations. More specifically, they
would be used to respond more to the demand and provide real time advice and support to Government.
Trust Fund resources would be used to strengthen partnerships and complement IDA resources. The
design also incorporated new ways of doing business which would enhance WBG effectiveness such as
the use of country system.
B. CAS implementation
60.
Overall CAS implementation was satisfactory. The CAS was implemented nearly as designed.
DPLs were the main lending instrument comprising at least 50 percent of annual commitments and 70
percent in annual disbursements. Investment Project Financing was used more flexibly either for
Adoptable Program Lending (as was the case in Agriculture –RSSP) or for Additional Financing (as was
the case in transport and energy). The Bank’s interventions remained in its core areas of engagement, with
close collaboration with IFC and MIGA in the private sector, agribusiness/horticulture, and energy.
61.
The DPL operations provided substantial financing to Rwanda’s budget, including during
the 2008 crisis. The DPLs—totaling $618.2m36 —were a cornerstone of the World Bank’s support to
implement the EDPRS. Since Rwanda depends on highly concessional financing, not just to cover an
ambitious investment program, but also to cover parts of the recurrent budget expenditures, budget
support grants provide a preferred contribution to Rwanda’s overall financing needs. The Government of
Rwanda looks to the World Bank and other development partners as a source of continued financing in
meeting these needs. The Bank was also successful in using the PRSFs to leverage additional
concessional funding for Rwanda, including US$10 provided through the Global Food Crisis Response
Program, US$29.8 million from the Crisis Response Window, and US$24 million from the IDA-15 buffer
fund. This also points to the responsiveness of the WBG to changing circumstances, priorities, and
demands of Rwanda. The CLSG/C series leveraged $12 million grant from the Health Results Innovation
Trust Fund (HRITF) supported by the Governments of Norway and the Great Britain and managed by the
World Bank.
62.
The Bank’s strong engagement through the PRSF series was successful in fostering better
donor coordination, improved harmonization, and reinforced support for reforms among the
country’s budget support donors: the World Bank, African Development Bank, and bilateral donors —
all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization Group and part of the semi-annual joint budget support
reviews (JBSR). Over the course of the series, the Bank was instrumental in supporting the establishment
and implementation of the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) process. While the
CPAF contains a number of outcome indicators, which other donors use as their condition for budget
support disbursement, the policy actions formulated in the CPAF are by design more process-oriented.
For Government, the goal of these policy actions is to be able to monitor if key milestones are being
achieved, thus, helping the Government to track progress over the year towards fulfillment of key
outcome indicators. The process nature of many prior actions contravenes World Bank good practice, but
should also be seen in the context of strong country ownership of the reform process. Some of the policy
actions supported by the series are highlighted in section II, paragraph 16, above.
63.
The success of the PRSF series was also largely helped by its ability to base its design on
strong sector dialogue. This was facilitated through engaging the sector specialists early in the process
and ensuring participation in sector dialogue through the sector working groups (SWGs). This has helped
to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive policy agreements reached at the sector level; (ii) strengthen
36

See table 2 below.

61

the capacity of sector ministries to present their needs and priorities during national level policy
discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate coordination of the Bank’s inputs into the CPAF
policy discussions in a timely manner. Representation of key sector staff in-country has been crucial in
contributing to this process.
64.
Three main trust funds (TFs) are linked to ongoing IDA operations (transport, LWH,
demobilization) and were leveraged to either meet a financing gap or scale up IDA operations.
Three stand-alone TFs were to meet specific needs of the Government: statistical capacity building,
economic empowerment of young girls and environmental sustainability, while another TF was used to
support continue capacity building efforts under the VUP program, following closure of the investment
operation, DCDP in 2009.
65.
The analytical pieces undertaken met the objectives of feeding into new IDA operations. The
Country Education Status report and Post-Secondary Education were used in the design of the Skills
Development project, and the just in time policy notes, mainly in the finance and private sector
development were used during investor conferences in energy and agribusiness/horticulture to showcase
the investment potential in those areas. Regular economic monitoring is done through the biannual
Rwanda Economic Update. More could probably have been done in the area of AAA and TA, but all
analytic work needed to originate from and be decided within the SWGs. The capacity building filter was
not realized, mainly due to design issues.
66.
Nearly the entire program was delivered, albeit with a few slippages and adjustments.
Slippages mainly occurred in the first fiscal year of the CAS, some due to challenges beyond the control
of the program (i.e. the non-applicability of the Indigenous policy and the need for confirmation from TF
contributing donors delayed preparation of the Energy Access and Demobilization/Reintegration projects,
respectively). Nonetheless, the slippages and adjustments did not significantly affect delivery of the
program. Two region operations – East Africa Road Network and East Africa Power Pool for FY10 and
11, respectively, were not delivered.
67.
Implementation of the ongoing program is satisfactory. Of the ten ongoing operations
(including TFs) only one (1) is rated moderately satisfactory (MS) on achievement of the development
objective (DO) and three (3) as moderately satisfactory (MS) on implementation progress (IP). The rest
are rated satisfactory (S) for both DO and IP. Disbursement ratio has been upward of 20 percent,
annually. Nineteen operations (9 DPLs and 10 IPFs) have closed during the CAS period and IEG has
reviewed implementation completion and results reports (ICRs) for ten of them. Annex Table 2 below
shows a satisfactory performance. The Bank pays close attention to monitoring and regularly reported on
the quality of the portfolio, quickly addressing issues as they arose. There was no violation of safeguard
policies and great efforts were taken to address fiduciary issues. Nonetheless, implementation capacity
challenges still remain mainly in fiduciary (financial management and procurement) and monitoring and
evaluation.
68.
Overall, Bank performance is rated as superior. The Country Survey37, conducted in 2012
confirmed just as much.

IV. Lessons Learnt and Suggestions for New CPS
69.
This section highlights key lessons learned during the CAS period and suggestions for the
new CPS. They include program selectivity, use of more flexible financing instruments, good results
framework, decentralized project supervision, delivering as one WBG, and the need to build capacity
within Government.
70.
Having a highly selective program helped to focus the design of the CAS in key strategic
areas where the WBG would add value. The CAS program targeted few areas, essential to Rwanda’s
continued growth and development aspirations. Government’s strong commitment to effective use of aid
through increased donor coordination and country ownership, further helped achieve selectivity. The
various aid coordination mechanisms helped maintain the dialogue and focused the reforms. The Bank’s
program continues to be strong and delivering development impacts across a broad range of areas. The
WBG’s partnership with the government and the development community is strong, and provides a
conducive environment to achieve development outcomes. The WBG should maintain a demand-driven
strategic focus within a framework of selectivity with priority to areas where it can contribute the most to
addressing Rwanda’s development challenges.
71.
Use of general budget support was effective in a number of ways but is vulnerable to donor
sentiments. A key lesson learned from the DPLs was that they proved to be effective in advancing
Government-owned reforms. The PRSF series provided important support to the Government to
operationalize the EDPRS by translating its objectives into priority actions, while the CLSC/SSPS series
supported the Government of Rwanda’s social protection system. As the DPLs progressed, so the reform
agenda evolved, but remained overall broad. This is attributable to the breadth of the Bank’s policy
dialogue with Government, but also reflects the recognition by policy-makers of the utility of the budget
support instrument in helping to move the reform process forward. That notwithstanding, the
unpredictable reaction by donors to delay or cut aid over real or perceived political risks has budgetary
implications and could have negative impacts on achievement of a country’s development objectives. The
uncertainty that surrounded budget support operations in FY13, showed Rwanda’s vulnerability to aid
shocks. It presented valuable lessons for quick reprogramming and designing of more flexible financing
mechanisms to respond to fast-changing country environment, as well as a rethink of future aid
architecture.
72.
Another key lesson learned from the successful implementation of the CAS is the
importance of capacity building. Given the capacity constraints of a small, but reform-oriented
Government, the principles of selectivity, ownership and predictability are emphasized in Rwanda. A
complex budget support framework requires capacity support for program design, elaboration of reforms,
identification, and measurement of outcome indicators. Strong capacity support has led to substantial
progress in reforms for example, in PFM, the health, education and agriculture sectors. Another example
pertained to the issue of lack of capacity on the side of Government in fiscal decentralization. That is why
part of the supported reform program of the PRSF series focused on capacity building, including to subnational levels of government in planning. This work is now being carried forward under the Quality of
Decentralized Service Delivery DPO. Regarding project implementation, however, capacity constraints
leading to slow implementation (including regional projects as most affected) still remain, highlighting
the need to rethink capacity building approaches, going forwards.
73.
A number of products were delivered as one WBG. In energy, financial sector, tourism, and
agribusiness, WBG teams worked jointly to deliver the Investor Conference on horticulture and tea in
2010, the Energy Forum in 2012, and different knowledge products across the private sector. Delivering
as one WBG has helped create synergy within the institution and yielded significant benefits for the
client. It demonstrated what could be achieved when delivering as one WBG.

64

74.
Much of project supervision was decentralized. In countries with limited institutional capacity,
having the TTL in the field can help to resolve issues as they raise with either the Implementing agencies
or Government and ensure a constant implementation pace. For a greater part of the CAS period, nearly
60 percent of TTLs were based in the country office. However, the trend has since changed, with many
operations now managed from outside the country office.
75.
The CAS had a good results framework. It focused on a few key indicators, some drawn
directly from the country’s own strategy monitoring framework and CPAF. This eased monitoring as data
would be available through different government agencies and the EDPRS’ central monitoring team at
MINECOFIN.
76.
A final lesson is that adequate stakeholder engagement is essential to enhance results and
outcomes. The Rwanda Country Survey 2012, demonstrated strong appreciation by different stakeholders
of the Bank’s engagement. Recognition was made of its strong engagement in policy dialogue and
commitment to supporting different government programs in order to achieve results and development
outcomes.

 A programmatic approach

from a previous phase, while
ensuring clear criteria and

 It is difficult to leverage
coordination and resources across
sectors without clearly defining
the roles and establishing a priori
the required commitment for intersectoral coordination. It is also
important to build capacity and
raise awareness on the functions
of wetlands for particular sectors,
and to the economy as a whole. In
the IMCE project, the lack of
inter-sectoral coordination was
part of the reason that it was
changed from a partially-blended

Operations blending GEF and
IDA financing should be
examined carefully during

Annex 3: A Diagnostic of Growth, Poverty, and Shared Prosperity
1.
During the 2000s, Rwanda has become one of the ten fastest-growing economies in the
world. GDP grew at more than 8 percent per annum between 2001 and 2011, mostly driven by domestic
demand supported by public expenditures financed through foreign aid. Strong growth was translated
into a rapid reduction in poverty from 59 percent in 2001 to 45 percent in 2011. In addition, growth over
the past decade was pro-poor, leading to a modest decline in inequality. Poverty reduction has mainly
been driven by a strong increase in agricultural production and the diversification into non-farm
employment. Nevertheless, the poverty rate remains high, and there is room to address the high levels of
inequality (including in access to service delivery). Sustaining the high rate of growth and poverty
reduction requires shifting from an aid-dependent, public sector-led development process toward growth
driven by the private sector. This shift will happen mainly through addressing constraints to conducive
business climate, effective/efficient use of public resources accompanied by domestic resource
mobilization, investing in human capital, well-managed urbanization, achieving accountable governance
through more effective decentralization to ensure greater equality in public service delivery, and
continued investments in agriculture and social protection.
I.

Trends in Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity

2.
Rwanda achieved solid progress on poverty reduction over the past decade. The share of the
population below a nationally defined basic-needs poverty line dropped from 59 percent in 2001 to 45
percent in 2011 (Annex Figure 11). Extreme poverty, defined as the share of the population living below
the food poverty line, declined by 16 percentage points, from 40 percent in 2001 to 24 percent 10 years
later.38 The decline was accompanied by a reduction in the poverty gap ratio. The distance between the
poor and the poverty line declined from 24 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2011 indicating that the poor
are now closer to the poverty line, which bodes well for future poverty reduction (Annex Figure 2).

Growth over the past decade was pro-poor. The mean growth in household consumption of the
bottom 40 percent between 2001 and 2011 amounted to 3.4 percent per year, exceeding the overall
growth rate of 2.8 percent. Growth was particularly high for the poorest 20 percent of households, which
grew by 3.7 percent per year (Annex Figure 3). The pro-poor pattern of growth resulted in a modest

4.
The combination of solid growth and inequality reduction boosted shared prosperity. The
shared prosperity indicator, a combination of growth in average incomes and the share accruing to the
bottom 40 percent increased by 37 percent between 2001 and 2011.39 Despite the modest reduction in
inequality, more than three-quarters of the increase in shared prosperity was due to growth and the
remaining quarter was due to the reduction in inequality. Similarly, almost all of the reduction in poverty
(99 percent) over the past decade can be attributed to growth in mean incomes rather than inequality
reduction. Growth has been the main driving force for poverty reduction.
5.
Progress on poverty and shared prosperity can largely be attributed to the strong
performance since 2006. Household consumption growth was pro-rich between 2001 and 2006, leading
to an increase in inequality (Annex Figure 5). As a result, poverty dropped by only two percentage points
during this period (Annex Figure 1) despite household consumption growing at 2 percent per year. Since
2006 however, the distribution of growth changed and benefited the poor more than the non-poor (Annex
Figure 6): the bottom 40 percent grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent between 2006 and 2011,
substantially faster than 3.7 percent growth rate of the top 60 percent. As a result, inequality decreased
rapidly and poverty fell by an impressive 12 percentage points.

39

Shared prosperity indicator as defined in David Rosenblatt and Tamara J. McGavock, A Note on the simple algebra of the
shared prosperity indicator (Policy Research Working Paper 6645, World Bank, October 2013). The shared prosperity indicator
does not have an intuitive interpretation nor does it have an upper bound. For the sake of completeness, Rwanda’s shared
prosperity indicator increased from 29,650 in 2001 to 40,692 in 2011.

The reduction in poverty was accompanied by improvements in non-monetary measures of
welfare as well. The fraction of children between 12 and 23 months with full vaccination coverage
increased from 76 percent in 2000 to 90 percent in 2010, while child mortality rates dropped
spectacularly: under-five mortality more than halved from 196 (per 1,000 live births) in 2000 to 76 in
2010 and infant mortality decreased from 107 to 50 (Annex Figure 7). Access to education improved at
both the primary and secondary level, though net attendance in secondary school remains low at 20
percent (despite having doubled since 2000). Despite a modest decline over the past decade, the rate of
chronic malnutrition remains high at 44 percent, jeopardizing human capital accumulation of the future
labor force.

7.
Access to basic services has increased over the past decade. Nevertheless, important
challenges remain to deliver basic services to the poorest citizens (Annex Table 10). Electrification, for
example, has mostly benefitted the wealthiest households. While the proportion of wealthy families with
access to electricity rose from 18 percent in 2006 to 39 percent in 2011, less than 1 percent of households
in the first two quintiles of the income distribution (the poorest 40 percent) have access to electricity. On
the other hand, other services, education, health, and water and sanitation have shown more incomeneutral or even pro-poor increases in access. Access to improved sanitation, in particular, has increased by
more than 50 percent among the poorest 20 percent compared to 12 percent among the richer 20 percent.
Access to safe drinking water has also increased at a (slightly) faster rate among the poor while health

Similarly, there is great inequality to access to services across districts. For example, usage
of sector administration provided by sub-district varies from 6 percent in Rusizi District to 98 percent in
Nyabihu District (Annex Table 11). Large differences across districts are also observed in access to health
services (e.g., health centers and district hospitals). The large inequality across districts reiterates the
importance of bringing the state closer to citizens through sustained decentralization efforts.

The second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2) sets
ambitious poverty targets. The goal is to push the share of the population poor down from 45 percent in
2011 to below 30 percent by the end of 2017 and to reduce the share of the extreme poor from 24 percent
to below 9 percent. Achieving these ambitious targets will require continued strong growth in household
consumption as well as a further reduction in inequality.
10.
Maintaining the progress achieved between 2006 and 2011 would enable Rwanda to attain
the poverty targets of the EDPRS 2. In the absence of inequality reduction, household consumption will
have to grow by 3.6 percent per annum between 2011 and 2017/18 if poverty is to be reduced to 30
percent (horizontal intercept of blue curve in Annex Figure 8).40 This growth rate is higher than the actual
growth in the past decade (2.5 percent) and the growth in the second half of the decade (3.0 percent).
However, if inequality were to drop modestly by 0.7 percent per year between 2011 and 2017/18, annual
consumption growth of 2.6 percent would be sufficient to attain the poverty target. If inequality is reduced
by 1 percent per year (the same rate observed between 2006 and 2011), the poverty target would be
attained with consumption growth of less than 2.3 percent. The extreme poverty target (red curve in
Figure 8) would be attained with an annual growth in household consumption of 2.8 percent and an
annual inequality reduction of 1 percent. This largely corresponds with the performance observed
between 2006 and 2011 (annual consumption growth of 3 percent and inequality reduction of 1 percent,
the red square in Annex Figure 8).

Development Goals in Brazil: Can micro-simulations help? (Policy Research Working Paper Series 2975, World Bank, 2003).

II. The Drivers and Constraints to Aggregate Growth
11.
The strong growth in household consumption and poverty reduction was led by strong
aggregate growth. Between 2006 and 2013, annual average GDP growth rate reached 7.2 percent, the
highest in EAC countries. A highly strategic approach to development, which has galvanized domestic
and external resources around nationally defined medium- and long-term goals, has delivered economic
growth. GDP per capita41 however remains low (US$620 in 2012, among the bottom 10 percent countries
in the world) although it almost doubled from US$320 in 2006. Despite high growth, economy’s
structure did not change significantly. The public sector plays a critical role (e.g. the public sector
accounted for more than half of the total investment), the non-tradable sectors are dominant, and
investment other than construction is limited. It is time to focus on the challenging second-generation
reforms of export diversification, structural transformation, regional integration, and financial sector
deepening through an increased role of the private sector.
A. Drivers of growth
12.
Growth in Rwanda has been driven by the non-tradable sector while the contribution from
the tradable sector (export crops, manufacturing, and mining) has been limited (Annex Figure 9-A).
This is reflected in the high-service sector contribution (54 percent) to the overall growth followed by
agriculture (21 percent) and industry (18 percent) as well as in growth decomposition by expenditure
items. (Annex Figure 9-B). While consumption was the main driver of the growth, investment (especially
non-construction) had a limited contribution (Annex Figure 9-C). Prudent macroeconomic management
and resulting macroeconomic stability (e.g., low and stable inflation rates between 2010 and 2013) have
been an important factor supporting high growth. For example, the authorities successfully contained the
impacts of the 2008/09 global financial crisis and the 2012 aid decline through monetary and fiscal policy
reactions. Despite authorities’ prompt and adequate repose to the aid decline, growth decelerated to 4.6
percent in 2013 due to the lagged effect of the aid shock.

Foreign aid and effective use of it have played a critical role in growth and macroeconomic
stability.42 Net official development assistance (ODA) as a share of GDP remained high at 20 percent in
2011 or 93 percent of gross fixed capital formation, though it declined from over 150 percent in the early
2000s. Aid flows into Rwanda have been redistributed through public expenditures. In the past decade,
foreign aid (accounting for 30-40 percent of the budget) has supplemented low domestic tax collections
and created fiscal space. While the direct impact of public expenditures has been relatively small (public
service contributed 10 percent to the increase in GDP between 2006 and 2013 as illustrated in Figure 10),
public expenditures stimulated private services such as trade and real estate. Foreign exchange inflows
through aid have also financed the negative current account balance (excluding official transfers) and
made the overall balance of payments positive in the past decade.
14.
Though growth was high, it has not stimulated a significant transformation of the economy.
Between 2006 and 2013, the sectoral composition of the economy changed only marginally. The
economy is led by services (45 percent) followed by agriculture (33 percent). 43 While the share of
industry somewhat increased due to construction (15 percent), manufacturing remains low at 5 percent
(Annex Figure 10). In the expenditure account, while the share of investment increased from 16 percent in
2006 to 25 percent in 2013, this was mainly due to investment in construction while investment in capital
goods increased only marginally (Annex Figure 11) and public investment financed by foreign aid
accounted for more than 50 percent of the total investment. On exports, while the share of exports

Rwanda’s growth accounting exercise measures the contributions of different factors such as
capital stock, labor, quality of labor (measured by average year of schooling) and total factor
productivity (TFP). The exercise shows that physical capital and total factor productivity were the main
drivers of growth. Although the investment rate as a share of GDP remains low, stocks of physical capital
have accumulated from a low base (Annex Figure 12).

B. Constraints to accelerated and sustained growth
16.
Rwanda’s medium-term development goals require growth to be even higher than it was in
the past. The Vision 2020 goals include GDP per capita of US$1,240, poverty rate below 20 percent, and
urbanization rate of 35 percent by 2020. To achieve these goals, the EDPRS 2 envisages an annual GDP
growth rate of 10.2 percent, which presents an ambitious leap from historic performance. However, the
growth pattern of the past decade (stimulating domestic demand through large aid inflows and effective
use of it) is unlikely to be replicated in the future. Given a possible decline in the share of aid in the
economy in coming years, roles of public expenditures are expected to shift from driving growth to
catalyzing it. The 2012 aid decline and resulting economic slowdown in 2013 have demonstrated the
negative impacts of aid fluctuation.

93

17.
A growth potential estimate suggests that Rwanda will sustain a high growth rate (7-8
percent) in the medium term (Annex Figure 13.44 This estimate assumes more than 3 percent of growth
comes from contribution from physical stocks (i.e., increase in investment is required) together with
maintaining high total factor productivity.

18.
In order to achieve accelerated and sustainable growth, it is imperative to transform the
drivers of growth from the public to the private sector by removing key constraints to private
investment. At the same time, for the public sector to play a catalytic role in achieving private sector-led
growth, it is important to mobilize domestic resources to create fiscal space and prioritize expenditures
through improved public financial management (PFM). Fast growing, non-resource-rich countries
typically have sustained investment rates of 25 percent of GDP or higher and bulk of it comes from the
private sector. In contrast, more than half of Rwanda’s investment (at 24 percent of GDP) is from the
public sector financed by foreign aid. Foreign aid accounts for 30-40 percent of the budget as the tax to
GDP ratio remains at 14 percent of GDP (much lower than Sub-Saharan Africa’s average at 25 percent).
Since foreign aid as a share of GDP is likely to decline in the medium term, it is essential to accelerate
domestic resource mobilization.
19.

Several factors have constrained private investment in Rwanda, including:


Small financial sector. Access and cost of borrowing money is one of top constraints to
conducive business climate.45 This reflects small financial sector in Rwanda. For example, the
number of borrowers from commercial banks is much lower than other EAC countries.



Weak infrastructure, particularly electricity. Firms in Rwanda pay the highest electricity costs in
the region at US$0.24 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) compared to US$0.15 per kWh in Kenya, and
US$0.17 per kWh in Uganda; businesses experience on average 10 power outages per month.
Availability and cost of electricity is ranked as the third most serious problem facing Rwanda.46
And as Rwanda is a land-locked country, the limited transport infrastructure makes transport of
goods very expensive; it is more expensive to bring goods from Dar es Salaam to Kigali than
from Europe to Dar es Salaam. The lack of adequate electricity supply and transport routes is a
major barrier to investment in manufacturing capacities.



Low human capital and qualified workers. As the services sector has been expanding faster than
education enrolment, skills have become a binding constraint to growth. Business surveys show
that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers with the right skills and often hire
foreign-skilled labor. At the same time, the share of the working-age population is increasing; but
taking advantage of this ‘demographic dividend’ only works if accompanied by an increase in
skills, particularly for new market entrants and youth. Enhancing human capital requires
improving the quantity (enrolment) and quality of education, but also of health services since
labor productivity is directly tied to health outcomes.

20.
While removing the obstacles to private sector development is imperative, there is also scope
to stimulate the economy through improving the effective and efficient use of public resources, increasing
agriculture/non-agriculture productivity, and leveraging urbanization.


Improving PFM. Mobilizing domestic resources through tax policy and administration reforms
from the low base at 14 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 will secure fiscal space for public
expenditures in general and public investment in particular. Building on the progress to date,
domestic resource mobilization should be accompanied by other elements of public financial
management such as a tighter link between planning and budget and improved public investment
management. Furthermore, given the disparity of access to public services across the districts,
public expenditures should be allocated so that they adjust the disparity.



Productivity gains in the agriculture sector. Smallholder farms and reliance on rain-fed
production characterize agriculture in Rwanda, which accounts for one-third of GDP and 70
percent of employment. Small farms face challenges accessing input and output markets owing to
weak rural infrastructure and low use of irrigation as well as limited market information. Various
policy actions could raise productivity in the sector, including legislative reform, investment in
rural infrastructure, and land administration reform.



Productivity gains in the non-agriculture sector. Despite its performance demonstrated in the
Doing Business indicators, private non-farm sectors show evidence of various bottlenecks to
productivity growth and investment. Business surveys point to numerous layers of bureaucracy of
the public sector and weak coordination between public institutions, which is particularly
affecting foreign investors’ decision to invest in Rwanda. Two areas of the business environment
that particularly stand out are land acquisition and tax payment. Investors report long delays
caused by the public sector in acquiring land. In addition, the transparency of the tax system
seems to be weak with numerous taxes and payments required from both the central and district
governments.



Leveraging urbanization. The continued population growth and high population density (highest
in Africa) provides a strong rational for Rwanda to leverage urbanization for economic growth
and poverty reduction. If managed well, urbanization would result in productivity enhancements
in the non-farm economy owing to the agglomeration effects of demand for consumption and
labor supply. In parallel, a reduction in the rural population would yield productivity
enhancements in farming as well given the labor surplus and high rates of underemployment that
currently characterize the agricultural sector.
III. Drivers of Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity

21.
Agriculture has been the main driver of household consumption growth and poverty
reduction in Rwanda over the past decade47. Consistent with strong public investments in agriculture,
particularly since 2007/8, aggregate agricultural output almost doubled between 2000 and 2011 (Annex
47

poverty.

95

Agricultural production index
(2000=100)

Figure 14. The increase in production accounted for 35 percent of the total reduction in poverty between
2001 and 2011. Increased commercialization of agriculture, as witnessed by the rising share of harvests
sold on local markets, explains another 10 percent. The improvements in agriculture have greatly
impacted the main income source of the poor: Poor households’ income from agriculture almost doubled
between 2006 and 201148. Taken together, the improvements in agriculture accounted for close to half (45
percent) of the total reduction in poverty between 2001 and 2011.

Source: FAOSTAT, 2014

22.
Rapid diversification into non-farm activities has been the second main driver of poverty
reduction. While only 20 percent of poor households had an income-earning activity outside of
agriculture in 2001, this had increased to more than 60 percent by 2011. This evolution has been
particularly salient for self-employment in small non-farm businesses, the so-called household
enterprises. The diversification into non-farm activities has reduced income risk, as poor households no
longer uniquely depend on agriculture, and hence on the vagaries of unpredictable weather patterns, to
generate income. The diversification into non-farm self-employment emerges as the second main driver
of poverty reduction, explaining 13 percent of the total reduction over the past decade (Annex Figure 15).
The progressive uptake of non-farm wage employment has been important for poverty reduction in Kigali
but has been of only marginal importance on the national level given Kigali’s small contribution to
overall poverty.

23.
Favorable demographics gave an extra boost to poverty reduction. The total fertility rate (the
average number of children a woman can expect to have at the end of the reproductive period) dropped
from 5.8 in 2000 to 4.6 in 2010. This drop in fertility led to a decrease in average household size and in
the youth dependency ratio (the number of economically dependent children per working-age adult in the
household). The drop in the youth dependency ratio, from 1.0 in 2001 to 0.9 in 2011, increased household
disposable income and accounted for 9 percent of the reduction in poverty.
24.
The drop in fertility holds a longer-term promise as well. As a result of the sharp decline in
fertility, the share of the labor force in the total population is projected to increase substantially over the
coming decades (from 53 percent in 2010 to 64-67 percent by 2050). Combined with a declining youth
dependency ratio, the rapidly growing labor force has the potential to significantly boost output and
growth.49 Reaping this demographic dividend will however require strong job creation to accommodate
the burgeoning labor force.
IV. Sustainability of Growth and Poverty Reduction
25.
For sustainability, Rwanda’s model for economic development demands an
environmentally friendly approach. Substantial parts of Rwanda’s economy, in particular its agriculture
and mining sectors, have direct impact on the environment. Hence, the country will face trade-offs in
developing these sectors, and improved management of environmental and natural resources will be
needed in order to support sustained growth. Input requirements (water, energy, land, raw materials) will
need to keep pace with projected rapid growth, while minimizing negative environmental externalities.
The Government takes environmental challenges seriously. A study is underway to explore some of the
“big picture” trade-offs that might occur between the pursuit of rapid growth and the imperative for
environmental sustainability over coming years.
26.
There are several risks to the sustainability of growth and poverty reduction, both internal
and external ones. The main internal risks arise from variable climatic conditions and the private sector
response to government reforms. Agriculture is the main employer and driver of poverty reduction but
49

Demographic Dividend.

97

remains vulnerable to the vicissitudes of unpredictable weather patterns and regional droughts and floods,
which can significantly affect output and progress on poverty reduction. Favorable weather conditions
will be a sine qua non for attainment of the EDPRS 2 targets. The important role given to the private
sector in the EDPRS 2 is challenging given the modest performance of the private sector over the past
years. In case the private sector does not respond well to reforms, the ambitious targets elaborated in the
EDPRS 2 would be adversely affected.
27.
The main external risks to sustainability relate to a more-rapid-than-expected tapering of
donor inflows, the pace of regional integration and the potential for regional conflict, and a
prolonged slump in the global economy. As a landlocked country, Rwanda is crucially dependent on
closer integration with its neighbors to facilitate imports and exports and drive economic growth. While
progress on regional integration could drive economic growth across the region and boost regional
stability, renewed tensions and conflict could stall integration, adversely affecting Rwanda’s plans to
become a regional hub, as well as donor flows with adverse implications for growth. Rwanda’s high
reliance on foreign aid makes its development strategy vulnerable to the uncertainty of donor flows.
While Rwanda is fairly insulated from the global economy, a prolonged slump would nevertheless have a
negative impact on growth prospects through lower demand for goods and services and more constrained
availability of external financing.
V. Priority Areas for Rwanda
28
Accelerating the rates of growth and poverty reduction from their already high levels will
require a significant restructuring of the economy. Achieving private sector-led growth will require
addressing constraints to a more conducive business climate by removing key bottlenecks in energy and
infrastructure. Sustaining or even accelerating the rate of poverty reduction will require continued growth
in agricultural productivity and an extensive and effective social protection system to support the incomes
of the poorest and most vulnerable.
29
Several priorities for mid-term sustained growth and poverty reduction in Rwanda
emerged from undertaking the analysis for this diagnostic and the CPS consultations with
stakeholders. In addition to addressing constraints to a more conducive business climate, other areas of
priority are effective/efficient use of public resources together with domestic resource mobilization,
investing in human capital, instituting well-managed urbanization, achieving accountable governance
through enhanced PFM and more effective decentralization to ensure greater equality in public service
delivery, and continuing investments in agriculture and social protection
A. Energy and transport
30
Turning the private sector into the driver of growth will require a substantial reduction in
the costs of energy and transport. The current high costs of energy and transport undermine the
competitiveness of Rwandan firms and Rwanda’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct
investment, constraining growth, and job creation. The need for significant enterprise development is
particularly important given the rapidly increasing labor force: an estimated 200,000 people will join the
labor force each year over the EDPRS 2 period, which is almost double the rate of job creation in the past.
A vibrant private sector will be needed to absorb this burgeoning labor force.
B. Agriculture, rural development and social protection
31
Agriculture has been the main engine of poverty reduction in the past and is likely to
remain so in the near term. The main Government programs in agriculture currently do not even cover
half of arable land, and productivity remains below the average of Sub-Saharan Africa. Irrigation and
fertilizer use are still low despite recent gains; and increased agricultural mechanization, currently at 12

98

percent, could result in strong productivity bumps. Addressing these issues while also building
appropriate rural infrastructure (feeder roads, markets, post-harvest storage facilities) and specialized
agricultural skills have the potential to significantly increase productivity and agricultural incomes and,
hence, result in sustained rapid poverty reduction.
32
While improvements in agriculture and rural infrastructure will go a long way in increasing
the incomes of the poor, they are unlikely to reach most destitute households. The poorest households
are often landless or have landholdings that are grossly insufficient to provide for even their most basic
food needs, which means improvements in agriculture will largely bypass them. These households either
need direct support to their incomes or the opportunity to participate in wage employment in public
infrastructure projects. The government’s flagship social protection program (Vision 2020 Umurenge
Program) currently covers half of the country’s 416 sectors, and a targeted and evidence-based scale-up
could result in more poverty reduction and continued pro-poor growth.
C. Urbanization
33
The high and increasing pressure on land and the need to create substantial off-farm
employment offer strong incentives for urbanization. Well-managed urbanization could be an
important catalyst for accelerated growth, improved service delivery, and non-farm job creation. Research
shows urbanization is associated with higher economic growth rates and creation of nonfarm jobs, which
Rwanda will sorely need in light of increasing pressure on arable land. In addition, urbanization to
secondary towns (as opposed to urbanization to the capital), a key element of the Government’s strategy
on urbanization, is linked to accelerated poverty reduction.50 Urbanization is also associated with lower
fertility levels and high levels of investments in children’s health and education, which are all conducive
to nurturing a productive future labor force.
D. Decentralization and PFM
34
Despite strong improvements in delivery of basic services, there remains a large inequality
in service delivery across districts. Access to basic health facilities (health centers) varies from 32
percent of the population in certain districts to almost 100 percent in other districts. Similarly, while in
certain districts nearly everyone has access to the local administration (sector administration), this drops
to a mere six percent for other districts. Decentralization, if done well, can provide a stronger match
between services delivered at local levels and services actually needed, and hence benefit local
populations in terms of quality of service delivery and improved living standards. This should be
supported by improvements in PFM, both at the national and subnational level, to optimize allocation of
scarce resources to sub-nationally identified priority areas.
E. Education and skills
35
Formal education and skills levels in Rwanda are low. The median level of education of the
labor force amounts to the fourth grade of primary school, and over 16 percent of the labor force have
never been to school. The situation is however improving for the younger generations: net enrolment in
primary school stands at 92 percent while gross enrolment in secondary school more than doubled in only
five years (41 percent in 2011 up from 20 percent in 2006). Despite these positive evolutions, the
Rwandan labor force is projected to remain relatively low-skilled over the foreseeable future.51

Diversification and Secondary Towns (Policy Research Working Paper 6422, World Bank, April 2013).

It is estimated that approximately 20 percent of the labor force will have secondary education by 2020. The mean years of
schooling is projected to be 5.6 (World Bank EdStats projections).

Rwanda cannot afford to wait for the current generation of children to complete their
schooling and enter the labor market. The skills of the current labor force need to be improved to allow
workers to increase their productivity and facilitate the move from subsistence agriculture toward a
higher-value, market-oriented mode of production or into higher-productivity, non-farm occupations. This
could consist of basic skills training for farm workers in functional and financial literacy, specialized
agricultural skills, and targeted vocational training to build basic skills for employment in labor-intensive
subsectors (construction, transport, light manufacturing).
F. Child health and nutrition
37
Despite recent improvements, the rate of chronic malnutrition in Rwanda remains high.
Forty-four percent of children under five years of age are stunted, down from 51 percent in 2005; and
almost one in five suffers from severe chronic malnutrition. Stunting in early childhood has consequences
that last for a lifetime. Poor nutrition in early childhood is causally linked to increased mortality, disease
and disability, worse educational outcomes, and lower productivity and income as adults. The first 1,000
days of a child last forever; consequently, the high incidence of malnutrition in Rwanda’s human capital
risks jeopardizing the health and well-being of it future citizens as well as its future labor force, with
negative implications for productivity and economic growth.

Data on malnutrition shows that poverty is not the only culprit. While poor children are more
at risk, 25 percent of children in the richest 20 percent of households are stunted. Similarly, some of the
poorest districts in Rwanda have the lowest rates of chronic malnutrition. This highlights the need for
improved nutrition education on appropriate feeding and care practices.

Annex 4: Rwanda and the MDGs
Poverty has significantly declined in Rwanda over the past decade, but challenges remain. While
the poverty headcount (the proportion of the population living below the national poverty line) decreased
by 14 percentage points between 2001 and 2011, 45% of the population lives below the poverty line.52
Therefore, despite the drop in poverty, Rwanda is unlikely to achieve the 2015 MDG-1 target for poverty
and hunger eradication (Table 3)53. The poverty headcount is much higher in rural areas (49%) than
urban areas (22%). Extreme poverty (the fraction of the population living below the food poverty line)
dropped by 16 percentage points over the past decade, but 24% of the population was still in extreme
poverty in 2011. Inequality slightly improved, reflected in a Gini coefficient of 0.49 in 2011 compared to
0.52 in 2006. The decline in poverty occurred during a period of high growth rates in Rwanda but also
during intermittent periods of food price inflation.
While notable progress has been made in a wide range of health and primary education indicators,
children malnutrition and stunting remains a very serious health problem (Annex Table 12). The
2009 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) and Nutrition Survey showed
that Rwanda has made progress in terms of increasing food security but indicated that more investments
are needed to sustain this progress. It is notable that the observed decline in poverty between 2006 and
2011 was accompanied by a decline in the proportion of female-headed households among the poorest
income quintiles. This appears to show that female-headed households are becoming less vulnerable,
which corroborates the excellent performance of Rwanda with regard to the achievement of MDG-3 on
gender equality.54 With regard to MDG-7 on environmental sustainability, Rwanda’s natural resources are
under pressure from the growing population, which is most evident in land degradation, soil erosion,
declines in soil fertility, deforestation, wetland degradation, and a loss of biodiversity. Further economic
development will increase environmental pressures by increasing energy consumption, pollution, and
urbanization. Progress in increasing the proportion of the population that has access to safe drinking water
and improved sanitation facilities is still too slow to reach the set targets.
The 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the EICV3 have shown that
maternal and child health has improved dramatically, and HIV prevalence has been contained at
3% since 2005. Under-five mortality decreased more than threefold since the early 2000s, hitting the
mark of a two-thirds reduction in child mortality targeted by MDG 4. Progress in health indicators was
mainly sustained by increased access to health care, largely due to the increased proximity of health
centers to residential areas. However, more progress still needs to be made with respect to nutrition.
Nationwide, 44% of children under the age of 5 are stunted, and 17% are severely stunted. In regard to
education, Rwanda has made progress in expanding access, with net primary school enrollment having
increased from 76% in 2001 to 99% in 2011. Also, the primary school completion rate increased from
24% in 2001 to 79% in 2011. If this progress continues, there is a possibility of the related MDG target
being achieved by 2015. However, indicators for secondary and tertiary education are still lagging behind
and there is a challenge to improve the quality of teaching, for example the primary school pupil to
qualified teacher ratio stood at 62:1 in 2011/12.55

53
The 2010 MDG country report set the goals to be met by 2015 in accordance with national priorities and through the
implementation of the EDPRS.
54
Within education, gender parity in literacy rates and gender enrollment parity at the primary level have been achieved. Within
the public arena, the number of woman in politics, parliament, and all decision-making bodies has sharply increased over the last
decade, supported by the government’s target of 30% female representation. For example, to date, women hold 56% of the seats
in Rwanda's Parliament, the highest percentage of female lawmakers in the world.
55
USAID Task Order 7 Early Grade Reading and Mathematics in Rwanda, February 2012 indicated that many pupils were not
receiving adequate instruction in the important skills needed to read and interpret text. The complexity of this effort is increased
by the change in 2008 from French to English as the medium of instruction.

Access to basic services has increased significantly among poor rural households. In Rwanda, 98% of
the poor live in rural areas. Between 2006 and 2011, access to public primary education among the rural
poor increased from 68% to 75%, and access to health centers from 63% to 81% (Annex Table 13). It is
worth noting that these improvements have taken place during the same period in which decentralization
was accelerated.

102

Important challenges remain to deliver basic
services to the poorest citizens (Annex Table 14).
Electrification, for example, has mostly benefitted
the wealthiest households. While the proportion of
wealthy families with access to electricity rose from
18% in 2006 to 39% in 2011, about 1% of
households in the first two quintiles of the income
distribution (the poorest 40%) have access to
electricity. On the other hand, other services,
education, health, and water and sanitation, have
shown more income-neutral or even pro-poor
increases in access. Access to improved sanitation, in
particular, has increased by more than 50% among
the poorest 20% compared to 12% among the richer
20%. Access to safe drinking water has also
increased at a (slightly) faster rate among the poor
while health insurance has increased by almost 60%
in all consumption quintiles, with a slightly more
pronounced increase for women (from 44% to 70%).

varies from 6% in Rusizi District to 98% in

(e.g. health centers and district hospitals). The large inequality across districts reiterates the
importance of bringing the state closer to citizens.

Annex 5: Counting Rwanda: the state of statistics and data
The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) was established in 2005. Since its inception, NISR
implemented two Integrated Household Living Conditions Surveys (EICV), two Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) and one interim-DHS, two Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability and Nutrition
Analysis Surveys, one Population and Housing Census, three National Agricultural Surveys and many
smaller surveys covering specific topics. Besides that the institute also produces on a regular basis the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) and a host of other routine economic statistics. Together with Development
Partners, the World Bank is supporting the NISR in its rapid development through its contribution to the
basket fund for the National Strategy for the Development of Statistics.


Core Statistics: NISR produces core economic statistics (national accounts and CPI) on a regular and
timely basis. The CPI is published each month on NISR’s website. National accounts are on quarterly
basis and published on NISR’s website by the 15th of the last month of the subsequent quarter. Trade
and monetary statistics are produced on monthly basis by the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR).
Monetary statistics are regularly published on BNR’s website while trade statistics are available upon
the request. Fiscal data are produced on quarterly basis by the ministry of finance (MINECOFIN).
Since 2012, they are unregularly published on MINECOFIN’s website



Quality, coverage and frequency of key data: NISR has been remarkably constant in the production
of key data. Censuses are implemented every 10 years (last one in 2012) and every five years there
has been a large socioeconomic household survey (EICV) with data on poverty (2001, 2006 and
2011). The next poverty survey is scheduled for 2013/14. DHS surveys were implemented in 2000,
2005 and 2010, with an interim one in 2008. The next DHS is planned for 2014/15.



Administrative data: Most line ministries have a Management Information System to keep track of
important data in their sectors. Administrative data systems are largely uncoordinated and quality is
believed to vary substantially across ministries. An assessment conducted by NISR in the framework
of the elaboration of the second National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (2014-2018)
revealed that most administrative records require strengthening. The Open Data Readiness
Assessment conducted in June 2013 also identified problems of sharing of administrative data
between ministries, with lengthy ad hoc procedures to obtain data from other ministries.



Data access: NISR has made solid progress in recent years in establishing a National Data Archive
(NaDa) and designing an interactive open data portal. Microdata from all recent household surveys
can be downloaded from the NISR website through NaDa after registration. In June 2013, the
Government of Rwanda and the WB conducted an Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) to
evaluate the feasibility and willingness to put all non-confidential government data (statistical and
administrative) in the public domain through an open data portal. The findings and recommendations
of the ODRA were largely adopted and the government is in the process of drafting an Open Data
policy.



Capacity and reliance on external consultants: Although a dynamic and ambitious institute, NISR
lacks the capacity to independently fulfill its mission. A recent capacity assessment showed only 14
percent of NISR professional staff has a Master’s degree and not a single one has a PhD. The bulk of
staff (81 percent) has Bachelor’s degrees. NISR depends on external international consultancy firms
for the implementation of key surveys and the analysis of complex survey and census data, which
substantially pushes up survey costs. Although this leads to quality data in the short-run, it begs the
question of long-run sustainability. Note however that NISR is currently implementing a five-year
capacity building program.



The World Bank’s contribution to statistics in Rwanda: The WB has been supporting the
statistics agenda in Rwanda since 2012 through the Statistics for Results Facility (SRF). The SRF
funding, amounting to US$ 10 million, is part of a Basket Fund for the National Strategy for the

104

Development of Statistics (2010-2014) together with DfID and the European Union. Through the
basket fund, the WB has supported data production, data dissemination and capacity building. The
SRF project has recently been restructured to address some start-up difficulties and to include
additional activities in the framework of NSDS 2 preparation. The closing date has also been
extended to June 30th, 2015. A recent independent evaluation of the SRF in Rwanda revealed
stakeholders’ belief that SRF has played a significant role in giving statistics a more powerful and
relevant role in economic and social management in Rwanda both in terms of technical support and
finance.

105

Annex 6: Environmental Review of Challenges and Opportunities for Rwanda to Grow
Sustainability
A rapid assessment of environmental and natural resource issues was conducted, focused on the key
areas of Bank assistance to Rwanda’s development strategy. This review showed several important
issues and areas of potential trade-offs, where improved management of environmental and natural
resource issues can be built into ongoing investments in the agriculture, energy, urban and SME sectors.
To support sustained growth, attention will be needed to ensure that priority sector input requirements
(water, energy, land, raw materials) can keep pace with projected rapid growth, while minimizing
negative environmental externalities. In agriculture, Government plans call for rapid and large
improvements in productivity and some shifting to higher value crops and value added processing. With
limited land, expansion or intensification toward one crop or subsector may mean less area available for
traditional or food crops. Trade-offs in land use will need to be carefully managed. Rapid expansion in
some subsectors (e.g., horticulture or tree crops for export) may require more fertilizer or pesticides or
improved practices to assure that expansion or intensification do not exacerbate erosion or contamination
of water supplies. Water and energy demand balancing and trade-offs will also be important to consider in
the context of the Government’s strong interest to develop the minerals sector, which is growing rapidly
from a currently low base. Transport, logistics and investment climate improvements may make some
kinds of deposits more economically viable. The Government will need the capacity to negotiate and
monitor mining sector transactions and to ensure that natural capital exploitation is transformed into
produced and human capital as an investment in future growth. As urbanization accelerates in Rwanda’s
effort to promote six new urban centers, it will be important to ensure that water and air pollution and
solid waste are properly managed.
Rwanda’s environmental legislation is decent, but there may be a need to strengthen capacity to
implement, including timely review of investment proposals to ensure that good environmental
regulations do not become a bottleneck to investment and growth. Decentralized municipal
governments will also need the capacity and resources to manage these issues, and the associated spatial
planning that will create more livable urban environments. Rapidly growing energy demand can be met
partially through increased reliance on renewable resources, but special attention will be needed to
monitor the demand and supply of fuel wood and charcoal to ensure that sustainably grown timber is
available to meet these needs and that growth does not accelerate encroachment into the protected areas
that harbor Rwanda’s natural heritage and biodiversity, which sustain the tourism economy. Climate
change will pose a new threat to Rwanda, particularly the need to build resilience into plans for
development in the agriculture, energy and urban sectors.
Environment and natural resource issues also offer some interesting opportunities for Rwanda to
apply ICT and create new jobs in environmental monitoring and management, especially in the
newly urbanizing areas and in the rural areas. There are also potential wins by incorporating green
spaces in Rwanda’s spatial planning and urban planning initiatives, using greener materials and
approaches in housing and infrastructure development and including innovative energy generation and
management (recycling, landfills and biogas generations) in urban planning. The table below details
some of the challenges and opportunities summarized here.

Annex 7: Donor Coordination
The Government of Rwanda takes a firm approach to managing development assistance with a
view to maximizing the impact of aid on strategic development targets. With development assistance
underpinning about 40 percent of budget expenditures in some years, there is clear importance accorded
to ensuring that synergies are optimized and duplication is minimized. The Government provides
guidance to development partners with respect to breadth and preferred sectors of engagement, an
approach that was introduced in 2010 following an initial internal review of donor engagement across
different sectors (donor mapping) in 2008. The results showed that Rwanda’s more than 30 DPs were not
equitably distributed across EDPRS sectors; there was donor overcrowding is some areas (mainly human
development sectors) and underfunding in others (infrastructure).
Rwanda’s donor division of labour (DOL) is an attempt by the Government of Rwanda to reduce
transaction costs and improve aid effectiveness. The Government’s guidance is that each development
partner engage in a maximum of three sectors. The allocation of sectors among different donors was
guided by several factors, including: (i) budget gaps in EDPRS priority sectors, (ii) ability of donor(s) to
provide the Government’s preferred aid modality/type, (iii) a track record in the sector/contribution to key
development results, (iv) mandate of the donor, (v) donor’s record against a range of aid effectiveness
indicators, and (vi) donor expertise and global experience.
Although the guidance proposes a maximum of three sectors per donor, it allows the use of
delegated cooperation/silent partnership agreements. This provides a phased approach through which
a given donor could continue to support in a number of sectors (in the medium term), while at the same
time taking steps to streamline policy dialogue and reporting. The DOL excludes: (i) sector budget
support, (ii) basket funds, (iii) support to exceptional expenditures such as demobilization, regional
projects, and emergency assistance, and (iv) support to NGOs and private sector entities (the latter being
the reason why IFC and MIGA are not guided by the DOL).
The areas of engagement identified through the WBG strategic planning process fit within the
framework for donor mapping. The strategy proposes that IDA will be directed to projects in urban and
energy sectors, through program for results to agriculture and accountable governance and through policy
operations to the social protection. The World Bank therefore occupies four sectors, though social
protection does not “count” because it will be in the form of budget support. Our fifth area, accountable
governance, is considered a cross-cutting area and therefore is in addition to the sector engagement.
Tables 1 and 2 below show the proposed DOL among non-UN Agencies and UN Agencies as of October
2013. The priorities of this strategy are reflected in the DOL.
Interface between the Government and development partners takes place at sector level, through
the sector working group, and at a cross-sector level in the Development Partner Consultative
Group (DPCG). The shift away from budget support has led both development partners and Government
to reconsider the roles of these groups. At the time of writing, terms of reference for both the sector and
cross-sector levels are under discussion. For the DPCG, the structure and modus operandi of the group is
also under discussion.
Within the framework of aid coordination and policy dialogue, the role of the lead donor is critical,
including being in regular contact with the client and coordination with other donors. It calls for
significant allocation of resources in terms of time, finances, and technical skills. The Government asks
that lead organizations have technical skills based in country. The World Bank has been asked to lead in
energy and urban development and to take an active role in agriculture (where we have handed the lead to
the EU). The WB also leads in PFM, alongside DFID and participates in the Private Sector Development
and social protection sector working group.

Annex 8: Client and Stakeholder Consultations
World Bank and IFC staff held joint consultations with a range of stakeholders on the contextual
analysis and framework for this partnership strategy. Consultations took place over a week in midDecember, 2013 and collectively involved126 individuals representing 58 organizations. The team is
grateful to the National University of Rwanda for hosting the consultations with academia in Huye, to the
Deputy Speaker of Parliament, for hosting consultations in Parliament with parliamentarian and to the
Private Sector Federation for convening the consultations with the representatives from domestic and
foreign enterprises. Other consultations, with civil society, development partners and with Government
partners took place in the World Bank offices. All these consultations were well-attended and vibrant in
discussion, some going well over the allotted two-hour sessions.
Information from these direct consultations is supplemented by the findings of the FY 13 Country
Opinion Survey in Rwanda. In general, the findings of the latest Opinion Survey – which draws on a
sample beyond government to include academia, the private sector, multi-laterals, the media and local
government - show clear signs of improvement in perceptions related to the work of the World Bank.
The FY13 data suggest a noticeable improvement in how aligned the Bank’s priorities are with country
development priorities, how realistic the Bank’s support is, the level of respect with which the Bank
treats stakeholders and the degree to which the Bank’s conditions are reasonable, as well as way the Bank
collaborates with government, donors and stakeholders. The data also notes improvement on how fund
disbursement has improved since 2006.
Key themes arising from the Country Opinion Survey and direct consultations were as follows:


Strong endorsement for both the analytical underpinnings and strategic focus: Government,
parliamentarians and development partners were supportive of the priorities being set for IDA and
cautioned against moving beyond the suggested areas of investment (urban, rural, energy, financial
sector, social protection and accountable governance). Both Government and development partners
felt that areas that were neglected by IDA were well-covered by other development partners. The
private sector particularly welcomed the emphasis on energy and financial sector development, along
with the advisory work that promotes private sector development across the thematic areas. Civil
society and some development partners emphasized the need to incorporate demand-side governance
mechanisms in the World Bank’s Governance work.



Appreciation for the joint World Bank Group approach. In particular, development partners,
Government and representatives of the private sector felt the stronger bonds between IFC and the
World Bank would be useful. There were requests for more presence by MIGA and for more
proactivity in advertising the range of instruments and resources available across the World Bank.
Group. The private sector had a specific set of suggestions for IFC in terms of what kind of
instruments might work well in terms of access to finance, capital market developments and
approaches to direct investments. Access to finance is constrained by the perception by financial
institutions that loans to smaller firms are high risk and the private sector was keen to see a focus on
risk reduction. Government urged IFC to invest in higher-risk ventures.



High demand for capacity building within the public sector and for skill development more
generally. The private sector highlighted the constraints they faced with respect to dealing with low
capacity institutions, with a particular focus on tax administration authorities. Parliamentarians
emphasized the need for developing skills throughout the public sector system and Government asked
that WB projects adopt a more strategic approach to skill development. Civil society groups
highlighted the need for capacity-building at sub-national levels of Government. This emphasis on
skills and capacity echoes the findings of the Opinion Survey where 27 percent of stakeholders
reported that inadequate government capacity is one of the greatest obstacles to reform.

112



Interest in diversified financing instruments. Parliament emphasized the problems that had been
caused by non-delivery or delayed delivery of budget support over the previous year and asked that
the World Bank consider instruments that are predictable and reliable. Government partners proposed
proportions of one-third projects, two-thirds a mix of program for results and development policy
operations. Development partners emphasized the need for the WB to match financing instruments
with an ability to continue to engage in the broader policy dialogue. Civil society requested more
direct financing of NGOs; they welcome the GPSA but find it inadequate relative to financing needs.
Both the private sector and Government asked that the WBG work together to deliver more quickly
on PPPs.



Across all respondents in Opinion Survey, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Rwanda received
a mean rating of 6.4, slightly lower than the mean effectiveness rating received in the FY ’06
country survey (6.7). Respondents from local governments had the highest ratings for the Bank’s
overall effectiveness whereas respondents from PMUs/consultants/contractors on Bank supported
projects and bilateral/multilateral agencies had significantly lower ratings. Effectiveness ratings
varied across sectors, however, and respondents in FY13 country survey gave significantly higher
mean effectiveness ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness compared to respondents in the FY’06
country survey in the following sectors: energy/natural resource management, global/regional
integration, urban development, information and communications technology, social protection,
transport, and law and justice. Some caution is needed in interpreting these perceptions, since the
Bank has not actually been active in some of these sectors accorded high ratings.



Stakeholders overwhelmingly identify the World Bank’s greatest value-added in relation to its
financial resources (54 percent), the survey findings show clear recognition of the importance of
the Bank’s work in capacity development. There were significant stakeholder group differences
in their ratings of the effectiveness of the World Bank’s knowledge work and activities. For the most
part, respondents from private foundations and civil society organizations tended to have the highest
ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from bilateral/multilateral
agencies tended to have significantly lower ratings.
