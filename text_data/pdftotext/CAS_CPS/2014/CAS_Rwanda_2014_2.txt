Foreword

R

wanda has made extraordinary progress in recent years. It is one of the few countries anywhere
in the world that has managed a “triple crown” of fast economic growth, robust reductions in
poverty, and a narrowing of inequality. This progress, so notable in this year marking the twentieth
anniversary of the Genocide against Tutsi, has helped illustrate the possibilities and opportunities
for any country seeking a new path of peace and prosperity. The fact that the poverty rate fell from
59 percent to 45 percent in the last decade and that Rwanda is now ranked as the second easiest
place to do business in all of Africa, speaks volumes. Yet we know there is much further to travel
on this journey.
What will it take to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity by 2030? And how can
the World Bank Group—the IFC, MIGA, and the International Development Association—help in
that challenge over the next five years?
These questions shape the World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy which draws heavily on
close consultations with the Government of Rwanda, the private sector, civil society organizations,
and international development partners. At the heart of the strategy lies the premise that the
growth and other developmental dividends of the post conflict period have been skillfully
harnessed, and that the transformation of the economy is underway. Rwanda is seeking to make
a shift in its growth trajectory that has the private sector at its vanguard.
Growth alone will not be sufficient. Progress on inequality reduction can also play a critical part in
helping meet Rwanda’s goals of reducing poverty and improving people’s social conditions. Welltargeted investments can help raise the productivity and incomes of the lowest groups. These can
include cash transfers, focusing on agricultural productivity and rural infrastructure to improve the
incomes of the poorest and transform livelihoods in rural areas in a sustainable way.
Managing the wide-ranging consequences of rapid growth will also require flexibility, strong
feedback loops, and capacity to respond to unforeseen developments. Building capacity at the
district-level will be an important ingredient in these efforts.
To help Rwanda respond to these challenges, the World Bank Group will mobilize financing and
knowledge to support the ambitious national agenda of promoting private sector-led growth that
is also inclusive and accountable. Working together, Rwanda will be on its way to creating jobs for
an increasingly urbanized population and lifting many millions more out of poverty.

Exective Summary

1

Rwanda’s progress has been rapid in recent
years, building on a two-decade-long
turnaround which has been remarkable in
both its pace and breadth. A highly strategic
approach to development has galvanized
domestic and external resources around
nationally-defined goals and delivered high
rates of economic growth, a significant decline
in poverty, a reduction in inequality and progress
in nearly all developmental outcomes. Rwanda
has done extremely well to reap the postconflict dividend, and now it is time to focus
on challenging second-generation economic
reforms of export diversification, structural
transformation, regional integration and financial
sector deepening. Alongside this economic
transformation, the Government will need to
boost the incomes of the poorest to maintain the
gains in poverty reduction and oversee the social
and institutional transitions that come with rapid
economic change. This strategy sets out how the
combined World Bank Group resources can best
help Rwanda achieve its poverty reduction and
shared prosperity goals.

Accelerating Economic Growth

Poverty reduction and shared prosperity

2

Efforts in reducing both poverty and
inequality—from high starting points—
have been impressive. The poverty headcount
dropped, with the share of population living
below the national poverty line falling from
59 percent in the early 2000s to 45 percent in
2011. In Kigali, home to 10 percent of Rwanda’s
population, the incidence of poverty decreased
from 22.7 percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent
in 2011. Starting from a much higher base,
the rest of the country experienced a 15
percentage point drop in poverty. The poverty
gap ratio, which takes into account the
distance separating the poor from the poverty
line, dropped by almost 10 percentage points,
from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 14.8 percent in
2011. This implies that those who still live
below the poverty line are now closer to it than
they were in 2001, which bodes well for future
poverty reduction. Inequality, as measured by
the Gini coefficient, fell from 0.52 to 0.49.

iii

3

Though growth was strong throughout the
last decade, it is only in the last five years
that there has been an effective translation
into poverty reduction. The first half of the
decade (2001-2006) was characterized by high
growth in Kigali and low, pro-rich growth in
the rest of the country, leading to an increase
in inequality and modest poverty reduction.
The second half of the decade (2006-2011)
experienced higher overall growth, mainly
concentrated in rural areas, and recorded an
exceptionally strong growth rate for the poor, in
particular the extremely poor. The net result is a
decade of strong growth and poverty reduction
during which welfare gains were realized
at each point in the distribution and were
relatively higher for the poor. The agriculture
sector has seen household-level agricultural
production more than double between 2001
and 2011, accounting for 35 percent of the
national’s reduction in poverty.
Government’s visions and aspirations

4

The Government’s medium term vision
and targets are set out in a series of
sectoral, locality-specific and overarching
strategic development plans. The medium
term goals are set out in the second Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(EDPRS 2), which aims to accelerate private
sector-led growth and further reduce poverty,
including extreme poverty. It seeks to do so
while reducing aid-dependency and increasing
self-reliance. The four thematic areas are: (i)
economic transformation, to achieve high
and sustained growth and restructure the
economy towards services and industry,
(ii) rural development, to bring the national
poverty rate below 30 percent, (iii) productivity
and youth employment, to ensure growth and
1

iv

transformation are supported by appropriate
skills, and (iv) accountable governance, to
improve service delivery and increase citizen
participation in and satisfaction with delivery
of development. These thematic areas are
supported by eight foundational issues which
are long-term ongoing priorities and seven
cross-cutting issues.1

5

The Government has set demanding
targets across the four thematic areas. These
include targets for economic growth, reduction
of poverty and extreme poverty, increases in the
installed electricity capacity, promotion of exports,
shifts towards a more urbanized population,
enhancements in access to infrastructure,
improvements in the quality of the labor force,
creation of jobs and SMEs and improved quality
of public services. Though some targets are very
ambitious, the direction established by the results
framework of the EDPRS 2 accords strongly with
Bank Group and IMF assessments of the priority
challenges. Taken together, the targets represent
a highly ambitious agenda for inclusive growth
over the coming years.

6

Projections show that poverty targets,
though demanding, are attainable—
but only if past patterns of growth in
consumption and reduction in inequality are
repeated in the future. Growth alone is unlikely
to reduce poverty sufficiently, and therefore a
balanced approach that emphasizes rapid
growth for the lowest two quintiles of the
population will be crucial. While the vision for
the future emphasizes the need for off-farm
employment to be created for an increasingly
urbanized population, an anchor in agricultural
productivity and rural development will remain
important to achieve this balance.

The foundational issue areas are macroeconomic stability, demographics, food security, basic education, primary health care, rule of law, PFM, and decentralization;
cross cutting issue areas are capacity building, environment, gender, regional integration, HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), disaster management,
and social inclusion.

7

Accelerating growth and creating jobs
through the intensification and deepening
of the private sector lies at the heart of
the development challenge and implies
significant action at policy and investment
levels. The imperative for job creation is
extremely strong; the total non-farm labor force
increased from 442,000 in 2001 to 1.4 million in
2011. About 100,000 formal and informal jobs
are currently created per year, which is only
half the annual growth needed to maximize
benefits from the demographic dividend.

8

Despite the very strong performance
with respect to the investment climate,
multiple challenges remain. The private sector
is relatively small and weak, and geography,
low productivity and high energy costs make
Rwanda expensive for enterprises dependent
on sea ports or energy-intensive processes.
The domestic market is relatively limited and
expanding trade has been hampered by crossborder tensions and inefficiencies. Enterprise
surveys—and feedback from the private
sector during the consultations for this CPS—
confirm key challenges, highlighting access
to finance and availability of land as the most
severe constraints, followed by infrastructure
(electricity and transport) and labor skills.
Other issues relate to the arbitrary, uncertain
and unpredictable way in which certain areas
of regulation are enforced.
Strategic options

9

The resources of the WBG are modest
relative to the financing needs of the EDPRS.
Selectivity in using IDA and close collaboration
with IFC and MIGA are critical in delivering the
maximum impact with these limited funds.
The CPS identifies a set of principles used
in defining future areas of engagement in

Accelerating Economic Growth

Rwanda, comprising: (i) alignment with the
twin goals of growth and poverty reduction;
(ii) comparative advantage relative to other
donors; (iii) opportunity to maximise internal
WBG synergies and present a coherent ‘one
Bank Group’ approach; (iv) client demand;
(v) risk especially with respect to capacity
constraints both on the side of Government
and the WBG. Based on this approach, the CPS
identifies selected priorities for WBG support
within three main themes.

10

The first theme has as its objective:
‘accelerating economic growth that is
private-sector driven and job-creating’. This
includes IDA investments and analytical
work in energy (to tackle high costs and low
reliability which are major barriers to enterprise
development) and urban development (to
enable the Government’s industrial strategy
and also help reduce poverty which is lower
in urban areas). It envisages active investment
by IFC in the financial sector, supported by
analytical work by both IFC and the World
Bank. IFC also foresees direct investments in
the private sector by IFC, alongside potential
MIGA guarantees. Both IFC and the WB will
engage in policy and analytical work in private
sector development, leveraging of publicprivate partnerships (PPPs) and investment
climate work.

11

The second theme is: ‘improving
the productivity and incomes of the
poor through rural development and social
protection’. With 80 percent of the labor force
dependent on agriculture, this sector is key to
increasing incomes. This needs investments
in agricultural productivity (partly because of
limited scope for expanding cultivable land
area), nutrition (to combat child malnutrition in

v

rural areas), rural roads and IFC investments in
horticulture, agribusiness and microfinance. In
social protection, IDA will support an expansion
of Rwanda’s social protection system, notably
the flagship Vision Umurenge Program.
Support will also help strengthen core service
delivery and the effective management and
harmonization of Rwanda’s social protection
system. There will be additional investments
for specific vulnerable groups (for example,
demobilized ex-combatants or victims of
gender-based violence).

12

The third theme comprises: ‘Supporting
accountable governance through publicfinancial management and decentralization’.
This supports the Government’s objective of
decentralising decision-making and making
Government more open and participatory in its
processes. This will include likely IDA investment
in PFM, fiscal decentralization, statistical systems
and open data. A team is currently considering
the viability of a Program for Results operation
that would drive results in areas of public
financial management, fiscal decentralization,
statistical capacity and open data.

13

Working across these themes is the need
to invest in and promote greater regional
integration. Rwanda’s size and location will
mean that stronger integration with regional
economies will be vital for further growth.
There are two elements to this. The first relates
to the need to expand markets for potential
investors, to the need to turn “land-locked” into
“land-linked” in the interests of competitiveness.
Countries of the region represent potential
markets for exports, managers of transport
corridors and facilitators of cross-border trade.
As such regional integration is as foundational
to the future growth path as having a sound
domestic investment climate. Secondly, regional

vi

integration and cross-border investments will
hopefully bring with it greater political stability
and security in the region.

14

Rwanda has expressed its interest in a
number of cross-border investments
in the Great Lakes region to make use of
regional IDA resources. These include the
financing of hydropower generation on the
borders with DRC and Burundi and improved
transport connections. IFC and MIGA stand
ready to engage in such projects where a
private sector role exists (e.g., the Rusizi 3 Power
Generation project). Some of IFC’s Rwandabased clients already serve both the domestic
market and those of neighboring countries,
particularly eastern DRC. Looking East, Rwanda
has expressed interest in a number of projects
that could provide faster access to the sea or
more reliable access to affordable energy.
Delivering for results

15

IDA allocations for the CPS period remain
indicative at this stage. The working
assumption is that allocations will be similar
to those in the past, perhaps a little higher in
recognition of the improving CPIA score and the
switch from a mix of grants and credits to credits
only. As such, IDA may commit approximately
US$200-250 million a year during IDA17, likely
spread across three investment operations, two
PforR operations and one series of three DPOs.
In addition, regional IDA should be leveraged
for some priority investments.

16

Budget support has been a highly
effective instrument for the delivery of
predictable, flexible financing to a reformminded government who spent the resources
well. But fluctuations in aid flows have to be
managed carefully, and this CPS anticipates

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

different combinations of instruments that
offer some flexibility in the financing that is
delivered. This CPS proposes less emphasis on
development policy lending. The Government
has requested more of the IDA17 allocation
in the form of program for results (PforR)
operations. While the previous CAS disbursed
66 percent in the form of budget support, this
CPS is likely to disburse the same proportion
as a mix of PforR and Development Policy
Operations.

17

IFC has ten deals outstanding in Rwanda
with committed volume of US$38
million. They envisage that their investments
will rise to US$120m by the end of the strategy
period, the bulk of which would be in the
financial sector. IFC expects to engage in the
financial sector through a local currency credit
line, a local currency bond issue and supporting
the establishment of a microfinance bank. In
the infrastructure sector they have identified
likely support to the Rusizi III power generation
project, Lake Kivu methane extraction
projects and Kigali Bulk Water Supply. With
respect to manufacturing, IFC is considering
investment for a mix-use commercial building
in Kigali. IFC’s Advisory Services portfolio has
been highly valued and regularly received
acknowledgement for innovation and impact
through the IFC awards schemes. The Rwanda
Entrepreneurship Development Program, the
Rwanda Investment Climate Program and the
Efficient Security Markets Initiative (ESMID)
have been particularly useful.

Accelerating Economic Growth

18

MIGA currently has two active projects
(KivuWatt and Bakhresa Grain Milling) in
Rwanda (total gross exposure of $110 million.
MIGA is open for business across all of its
Political Risk Insurance product lines, including
Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of
Contract and War and Civil Disturbance, as well
as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.
Managing risks

19

Risks to growth and poverty reduction
arise from variable climatic conditions,
and the private sector response to
government reforms. Stepping up measures
to make agriculture more climate-resilient, for
instance through the construction of irrigation
facilities and terracing which the Bank is
supporting, will be critical. Support for the
private sector is targeted at taking advantage
of a better business environment. External risks
relate to the pace of regional integration and
the potential for regional conflict, more-rapidthan expected tapering of donor inflows, and
a prolonged slump in the global economy. The
CPS seeks to mitigate the risks on the regional
integration side through regional projects,
the exposure to flu ctuations in aid flows
through the choice of instruments and the aid
dependence through measures to improve
domestic revenues.

I. Introduction

1

Rwanda’s progress has been rapid in
recent years, building on a two-decadelong turnaround, which has been remarkable
in both its pace and breadth. This Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) is presented to the
Board at a time when Rwanda commemorates
the twentieth anniversary of the Genocide
against Tutsi. In Rwanda, it is a period of intense
reflection on the past successes and mistakes
and, looking forward, of discussion and debate
regarding the future.

2

A highly strategic approach to development,
which has galvanized domestic and external
resources around nationally defined mediumand long-term goals, has delivered economic
growth, a significant decline in poverty, and a
reduction in inequality (refer to Box 1). Nonmaterial measures of wellbeing have also
improved, with impressive progress across
a sweep of Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). Of particular note is the progress in

Accelerating Economic Growth

advancing gender equality, including in complex
areas of political empowerment—Rwanda now
has the most female representation in parliament
in the world.

3

While Rwanda has done extremely well
to reap the post-conflict dividend, these
gains are largely exhausted. It is time to focus
on challenging second-generation reforms of
export diversification, structural transformation,
regional integration, and financial sector
deepening. Economic growth has been strong,
but the Government recognizes that structural
transformation is needed to underpin the
transition to middle-income status. A shift
from the current growth path, which is led by
public investment dependent on high levels of
donor financing, to a growth path that has the
private sector at the vanguard of growth, will
be one of the most fundamental elements of
the transformation.

1

Box 1: Delivering development: how has Rwanda done it?
Rwanda’s performance since the Genocide twenty years ago has been remarkable in terms of social and
economic outcomes. How have they done this and can others learn from the experience? Some important
factors include the following:
• An imperative to re-build from the worst possible situation, innovating where necessary. At one level, there
was no alternative but to deliver. The country had been devastated in every aspect and the new Government
quickly realized the importance of reviving and restoring confidence in the economy and the fabric of society.
During this period, much was achieved through a combination of innovative institutional delivery and participatory
community-based approaches that rebuilt the collective spirit of Rwandans.
• A clear vision, motivated by challenging objectives, supported with resources which do not leak. A series of
strategies and plans developed over the last twenty years have consistently targeted poverty reduction and social
and human development outcomes. The attack on corruption and improvements in public financial management
(for example, the introduction of a meaningful MTEF) meant that public resources were spent on achieving the
vision. Clarity on the end goals has been an important unifying force across Government at different levels and
across executive and administrative branches. The development of strong statistical systems has allowed progress
to be monitored, adjustments to be made and accountability to be enforced.
• Contracts for results that cascade through the system and high standards of government effectiveness. The
drive for results has very strong support and leadership from the highest levels in Government. The President’s
Office and the Prime Minister’s Office have driven the culture of performance. They track progress made towards
EDPRS goals to hold government staff accountable for achieving results through the agreement of performance
contracts (the imihigo), which specifies the results to be delivered over the coming year and are now formalized
around strategic indicators and targets linked to the EDPRS and MDGs. Rwanda uses incentives such as national
pride in combination with consequences for insufficient performance (loss of job for example) to motivate
officials. The Annual National Leadership Retreat provides official reporting in front of peers and the President
himself on performance against EDPRS goals and retreat-specific actions from the previous year2. This has proven
very effective in achieving results. Through the National Dialogue Council “Umushyikirano” coordinated by the
Prime Minister and Chaired by the President, citizens debate issues relating to the state of the nation, the state of
local government and national unity.
• A desire for learning and a cycle of experimenting, measuring, learning, adapting that generates powerfully
productive home-grown solutions: Beginning with simple budget monitoring and expanding into a more
sophisticated monitoring system, processes have been developed over time that inform the accountability
relationships between the top level of government, line ministries and districts. These are formalized with established
monthly, quarterly, and annual reports between groups to measure progress towards the EDPRS targets. As part
of efforts to reconstruct Rwanda and nurture a shared national identity, the Government of Rwanda drew on
aspects of Rwandan culture and traditional practices to enrich and adapt its development programs to the
country’s needs and context. The result is a set of home-grown, culturally-customised solutions (e.g. Gacaca,
Umushyikirano, etc) which have translated into sustainable mechanisms for addressing Rwanda’s social and
economic development challenges.

These retreat-specific actions are generally associated with problem areas in achieving the EDPRS or MDG goals and identification of strategies to overcome them.

Intensifying regional integration, looking
both east and west, will ease some of the
bottlenecks that the economy faces. Looking
to the Great Lakes region, the recently signed
Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework
(PSCF) provides opportunities for shared
investments that could generate more reliable
and affordable power, facilitate trade, and
expand markets for Rwanda’s exports. Looking
to the East African Community (EAC), there are
opportunities for infrastructure investments that
make transport corridors more functional and
power imports more affordable, so reducing
costs for businesses investing in Rwanda and
improving competitiveness.

5

A medium-sized client of the World Bank
Group (WBG), Rwanda has regularly been
presented as a success story for the rewards
of efficient donor harmonization and budget
support. Over the last Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) period, 66 percent of the World
Bank commitments were in the form of budget
support, reflecting the balance of aid modalities
adopted also by other multilateral and bilateral
donors. By all accounts, evidence suggests this
is a country where development assistance has
had a positive, sustainable impact.

6

Recent delays in delivering financing
through budget support have exposed the
vulnerabilities associated with delivering aid
through these mechanisms. The choice and
balance of financing instruments is under reconsideration by many donors—in particular
a move away from “general” budget support—
and donor coordination mechanisms are being
re-drawn as a result. Both donors and the
Government remain committed to finding a
mechanism that provides space for efficient and
effective dialogue on issues of developmental

Accelerating Economic Growth

importance. Reducing dependence on donor
assistance and expansion of the currently narrow,
undiversified export base will be important
to minimize the vulnerability of growth to
fluctuations in foreign exchange revenues.

7

The Government’s national strategies are
highly ambitious. It is seeking an exit from
low-income status by 2020, a reduction of the
nationally estimated extreme poverty rate to 9
percent by 2017, and GDP growth rates of 10.2
percent per annum (11.5 percent by 2020). The
sectoral targets that cascade from these goals
are no less challenging. The collection of goals
and targets defined by Government across the
broad range of national and sectoral strategy
provides a strong sense of alignment with WBG
corporate goals for extreme poverty reduction
and shared prosperity and represent a strong
framework to which the WBG can align.

8

Acknowledging the progress to date, the
prospects and visions for the future, and
the emerging development challenges, this CPS
highlights the role for the WBG in supporting the
achievement of national objectives and WBG
corporate goals. The CPS has been prepared
jointly by a team from IDA, IFC and MIGA and
represents a shared view of how resources
across the whole WBG can best be leveraged.
It draws on considerable background analytical
work, which is partially summarized in Annex 3.
Mirroring the timeframes of the Government’s
own strategies, this CPS is presented as a five-year
strategy that has room for mid-term adjustment
to ensure continued relevance. It reflects input
from in-country consultations with Government
partners (including representation of local
government), the private sector, development
partners, civil society, and academia.

II. Rwanda’s progress and prospects

A. Economic developments and challenges

9

Strong policies have helped Rwanda
achieve outstanding economic progress
from a low starting point. Prudent fiscal and
monetary policies geared towards maintaining
macroeconomic stability, coupled with an
emphasis on building institutional capacity, on
promoting good governance, and on creating
a business-friendly environment, contributed
to low inflation and average annual economic
growth in excess of 8 percent over the last
decade. From a regional perspective, Rwanda’s
macroeconomic performance has generally
outperformed its peers and earned the country
a spot on the list of the 10 fastest-growing
economies in the world. Public debt remained
modest and reserve buffers kept the economy
resilient to macroeconomic shocks.

10

The World Bank and IMF share the
positive assessment that Rwanda’s
macroeconomic policy framework is adequate

3

4

and macroeconomic management is effective.
Quick and appropriate fiscal and monetary
responses to the global financial crisis in 2009
and to the short-term aid shortfall in mid-2012/
early 20133 illustrate the capacity for effective
management of macro shocks. Rwanda has
been under IMF programs since early 2000s
including two Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facilities (PRGFs) in 2000s. The IMF successfully
concluded the Policy Support Instrument (PSI)
at the end of 2013 and embarked on a new
PSI program for another 3 years. The new PSI
represents a continuation of the authorities’
prudent approach to macroeconomic policy.
The fiscal framework aims to mobilize domestic
revenues and adjust spending to available
resources, while protecting priority spending
and minimizing domestic financing to leave
ample space for private sector growth. On the
monetary side, the BNR remains committed to
low inflation and financial sector stability and is
building its capacity to achieve these objectives.

The aid shortfall created a fiscal gap amounting US$230 million (equivalent to 3 percent of GDP) in the first half of FY2012/13, although more
than half US$140 million was disbursed in the second half.

Real sector developments

11

Rapid growth over the past decade has
seen GNI per capita rise dramatically from
US$185 to US$620.4 The economy is dominated
by the services sector, which accounted for 45
percent in 2013, followed by the agriculture
sector (33 percent) and the industry sector (15
percent)5. The volume of Official Development
Assistance (ODA) increased from US$360
million in 2002 to US$0.9 billion in 2012 (13
percent of GNI) and these substantial inflows of
foreign aid have stimulated the services sector
through Government expenditures. The services
sector, most notably trade, transportation and
communications, contributed to more than half
of the increase in GDP between 2008 and 2013.

12

The aid shortfall and resulting delays
in budget expenditures in the second
half of 2012 resulted in lower credit growth
to the private sector and contributed to a
deceleration in growth during 2013. Real
growth decelerated from 7.3 percent in 2012 to
4.6 percent in 2013, while growth in the services
sector slowed from 10.8 percent in 2012 to 3.6
percent in 2013.
External sector

13

Rwanda’s balance of payments is
characterized by negative current account
and positive overall balance (at 1.5 percent
of GDP), as large trade deficits in the current
account are offset by grant aid inflows. This
positive overall balance of payments has enabled
Rwanda to increase the level of foreign reserves
from US$142 million in 2002 to US$1.1 billion in
2013. As aid flows faltered in the second half of
2012, the current account deficit increased from
7.2 percent in 2011 to 11.4 percent of GDP before
settling again at around 7 percent in 2013.
4
5

14

Exports have expanded by 40 percent
since 2012, mostly driven by an increase
in major export products such as coffee and
minerals. This increase in exports combined
with a slow growth in imports has resulted in
an export to import ratio of 54 percent. The
resumption of aid in the first half of 2013
(including budget support operations totaling
US$140 million) and the issuance of Eurobonds
amounting to US$400 million in April 2013
have also contributed to the recovery of the
external position.

15

In general, the last decade saw a steady
strengthening in the export sector;
exports of goods increased by 24 percent on
an annual basis and reliance on traditional
exports (coffee, tea and minerals) fell from
over 90 percent to 70 percent. Tourism is now
the largest export item in Rwanda. Though
still just below 5 percent of total exports, the
share of manufactured products in the export
basket tripled in dollar value between 2007
and 2011 with a particular increase in light
manufactured products (milled products,
hides and skins, and beverages). Re-exports
are also beginning to play a more prominent
role in Rwanda’s export basket, including
petroleum products and vehicles.
Inflation, monetary, exchange rate, and
financial sector policies

16

Rwanda’s monetary and exchange
rate policy framework is consistent
with macroeconomic stability and growth
targets. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR)
has strengthened the liquidity management
framework to enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy and improve the monetary
policy transmission mechanism. The BNR recently

The remaining share (6 percent) is due to adjustment items.

Accelerating Economic Growth

5

introduced a more flexible monetary targeting
framework by introducing a reserve money band
of ±2 percent around the central reserve money
target. In the wake of the aid shortfall, the BNR
kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 7.5
percent between May 2012 and mid-June 2013
to anchor inflation expectations from substantial
Government borrowing on the domestic market.
Inflation rates have been stable and reasonable in
recent years. In 2013 inflation fell to 4.2 percent
from 6.3 percent in 2012.

17

Exchange rate policies have permitted
greater exchange rate flexibility since
the introduction of an exchange rate corridor
framework in March 2010. The exchange rate
regime is classified as de facto crawl-like and de
jure floating. The BNR started to use a marketbased exchange rate calculated as a weighted
average of foreign exchange interbank rates
and intervention transactions rate in December
2010. In 2012, the overall foreign exchange risk
exposure for banks was set at ±10 percent of
their core capital in line with practice in most of
East African Community (EAC) countries.

18

The financial sector remained stable until
the first half of 2013, and appears fairly
resilient to shocks. As of June 2013, the capital
adequacy ratio (total capital to risk weighted
assets) of the banking sector remained stable
at 23.1 percent, well above the 15 percent
minimum stipulated by the regulations.
Fiscal policies and developments

19

Fiscal policy is consistent with a macro
framework that is focused on maintaining
stability while promoting economic growth.
The composition of public expenditure is
well-aligned to the national goals of growth
acceleration and poverty reduction identified in
6

6

the second Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2). The mediumterm fiscal policy framework aims towards
fiscal consolidation through increased revenue
mobilization and expenditure prioritization,
including infrastructure projects. Actual budget
expenditures remain above 90 percent of planned
expenditures. Information on the budget and its
execution is open to the public. The website of
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MINECOFIN) includes information on Budget
Execution Report for the FY2012/13 as well as
the 2013/14 Approved Budget.6

20

At 29 percent of GDP, Government
expenditures represent a large share
in the economy and are underpinned by
development assistance. Tax revenues have
increased, from a low base, by more than 2 percent
of GDP in the past decade to reach 14 percent
in FY2012/13. The introduction of a new ValueAdded Tax Law and improvements in taxpayer
services such as electronic filling and payments
have helped in this regard. Aid accounted for
between 40-50 percent of the total revenues
over the last decade, and when it fluctuates the
Government has taken appropriate measures
to protect non-discretionary spending such as
wages and social expenditures and maintain a
prudent fiscal position.
B. Macroeconomic outlook and debt
sustainability

21

Bank staff estimates that Rwanda’s
economy will grow at 6 percent in 2014,
as the impact of the resumed aid inflows and
resulting government expenditures filters
through. The inflation rate is projected to remain
moderate, though poor recent harvests will
possibly generate some inflationary pressure.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

22

Rwanda’s risk of debt distress rating has
improved from moderate to low in the
latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) in
response to a broadened export base. The
total public debt outstanding at the end of 2013
stood at 21.5 percent of GDP and the DSA shows
that Rwanda’s external debt remains below
the indicative thresholds under all scenarios
examined. The DSA further acknowledges
that the authorities have made progress on
enhancing their debt management capacity. A
major development was the preparation and
presentation by the authorities of their own DSA
in October 20122.

23

Balance of payments vulnerability is
expected to decline in the medium
term, but in the near term the current account
balance will depend on aid inflows. The current
account is expected to remain in deficit over
the medium term, but deficits are expected
to narrow as some of the large strategic
investment projects come to completion and
exports continue to grow. While exports are
vulnerable to fluctuations in international
commodity prices, the Government expects that
the implementation of the recently approved
National Export Strategy, which provides a
framework for increasing exports, will yield early
results in terms of the diversification of exports.
To finance the current account deficit, foreign
direct investment (FDI) is expected to increase
from 2.2 percent in 2012 to 4.7 percent of GDP
in 2018. International reserves are projected to
exceed 4 months of imports after 2015.

24

The IMF’s new 3 year PSI is optimistic on
fiscal sustainability issues, projecting the
state budget to significantly improve in the
medium-term. Under these projections, the
domestic revenues to GDP ratio will increase

Accelerating Economic Growth

from 16 percent in 2012/13 to 19.2 percent
in 2017/18, while the grants to GDP ratio will
decrease from 7.9 percent to 5.4 percent during
the same period. As such, the share of grants
in the revenues will decrease from 33 percent
in 2012/13 to 22 percent in 2017/18, indicating
reduced aid dependency.
C. Poverty reduction and social development

25

A strong focus on homegrown policies
and initiatives contributed to a significant
improvement in access to services and in
human development indicators. Analysis from
the Bank’s Rwanda Economic Update shows
how the considerable inflows of foreign aid
have been effectively used in support of socioeconomic development. The strong growth was
accompanied by substantial improvements in
living standards, evidenced by a two-thirds drop
in child mortality and the attainment of nearuniversal primary school enrolment. There has
been impressive progress towards meeting the
MDGs (Annex 4).

26

Particularly notable have been the
efforts in reducing both poverty and
inequality from high starting points. The
poverty headcount dropped, with the share of
population living below the national poverty
line falling from 59 percent in the early 2000s
to 45 percent in 2011. In Kigali, home to 10
percent of Rwanda’s population, the incidence
of poverty decreased by six percentage points,
from 22.7 percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent in 2011.
Starting from a much higher base, the rest of
the country experienced a 15 percentage point
drop in poverty. The poverty gap ratio, which
takes into account the distance separating the
poor from the poverty line, dropped by almost
10 percentage points, from 24.4 percent in

2001 to 14.8 percent in 2011. This implies that
those who still live below the poverty line
are now closer to it than they were in 2001,
which bodes well for future poverty reduction.

27

There is much to learn from the past
growth path regarding the effective
transmission of growth into poverty reduction.

Though growth was strong throughout the last
decade, it is only in the last five years that there
has been an effective translation into poverty
reduction. Growth incidence curves (Figure 1 and
Figure 2) show how different the growth patterns
were in the first and second halves of the decade
with respect to their capacity to reduce poverty.
The different poverty performance between the
first and second halves of the decade can largely
be explained by differences in the magnitude
and nature of growth. The first half of the decade

(2001-2006) was characterized by high growth in
Kigali and low, pro-rich growth in the rest of the
country, leading to an increase in inequality and
modest poverty reduction. The second half of the
decade (2006-2011) experienced higher overall
growth, mainly concentrated in rural areas, and
recorded an exceptionally strong growth rate
for the poor, in particular the extremely poor.
The net result is a decade of strong growth and
poverty reduction during which welfare gains
were realized at each point in the distribution
and were relatively higher for the poor.

households have reduced risk by diversifying
in non-farm income activities. The fraction
of households with an occupation outside
agriculture more than doubled from 30 percent
in 2001 to 70 percent 10 years later. This
progressive move towards self-employment in
small nonfarm businesses has particularly been
important, explaining 13 percent of the overall
reduction in poverty. The sharp drop in fertility
observed over the past five years has led to
smaller families and decreased dependency
ratios, increasing household disposable income.

28

29

Poverty reduction over the past decade
has mainly been driven by improvements
in agriculture and rural development.
Household-level
agricultural
production
more than doubled between 2001 and 2011,
accounting for 35 percent of the reduction in
poverty (Figure 3). Households also produced
progressively for the market, witnessed by an
increase of the share of the harvest sold from
13 percent in 2001 to 21 percent in 2011. This
increased commercialization of agricultural
activity accounts for a further 10 percent of
the reduction in poverty. At the same time,

Can these rates of poverty reduction
continue or even be accelerated over
the next five years and more? Many of the poor
are now clustered just below the poverty line,
meaning that a small increase in consumption
can push these households over the threshold
(Figure 4). This bodes well for the future pace
of poverty reduction as the “bulge” approaches
and crosses the line. Equally important, the
share of poor households located far below the
poverty line (with consumption expenditures
of less than half the poverty line) has decreased
by substantially from 38 percent in 2001 to 22

D. Governance and Institutions

31

30

Rwanda has achieved remarkable
progress in rebuilding the core institutions
of the state over the last two decades. It has
established a political settlement and maintained
national security since the Genocide in a very
difficult environment. Such a fast progression
to peace and security from violence is in stark
contrast with many conflict affected countries,
which often grapple for some time with the
challenge of establishing their legitimacy and
authority across their territorial boundaries and
protecting citizens’ basic security. Evidence
suggests a high level of personal security; the
homicide rate stands at 5.1 per 100,000 (2009
data) and United Nation Office on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC) data indicate that Rwanda’s
rate is significantly lower than for neighboring
countries. At the same time, Rwanda scores well
on indicators of government effectiveness and

Accelerating Economic Growth

As part of its development vision, the
top leadership has pursued vigorously a
zero tolerance approach to corruption, which
has been fundamental to the strong growth
and service delivery performance recorded over
the past decade. Transparency International has
ranked Rwanda as the least corrupt country in
the East Africa Community (EAC) and among the
least corrupt in Africa, a trend also consistently
reflected in the Mo Ibrahim Index for the last
10 years. A raft of oversight institutions has
been established to control corruption and
promote integrity and there is a constitutionally
upheld asset declaration process for public
officials, although this is not public. Legal and
administrative sanctions are imposed to ensure
performance and discipline in the system, with
several senior officials tried in the courts in
recent years and police officers dismissed for
soliciting bribes.

Note: The worldwide governance Indicators (WGI) are a research dataset summarizing the views on the quality of govnernance provided by
a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries. These data are gathering from
a number of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private sector firms. The WGI
do not reflect the official views of the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the counties they represent. The WGI are not used by the World
Bank Group to allocate resources

32

The Government has also taken the
approach that to deliver results it must
drive forward radical and ambitious public
sector reform. It radically restructured the
administration early on in the recovery phase
in 1998-1999 through a large-scale downsizing
with over 6,000 civil servants being dismissed
because they were not qualified and over
6,500 being removed from the payroll as ‘ghost
workers’. Salaries to the much smaller number of
staff were increased by 40 percent to eliminate
the incentive for supplementing income
through petty corruption. From 2000 in tandem
with significant fiscal, political and administrative
decentralization reforms, central Government
ministries were unbundled to create flatter and
considerably downsized structures and bring
service delivery closer to the grassroots for
enhanced performance and accountability.

33

Rwanda’s
public
administration
nevertheless still faces a number of
significant institutional capacity challenges

12

that will affect long term resilience and overall
governance capacity if left unaddressed.
The skills deficit is still significant and many
of the new institutions lack the right staff and
coordination mechanisms. The incentives for
attraction, promotion and retention of staff
require improvement to counter the high (by
regional standards) vacancy and turnover rates.

34

Rwanda scores much lower on voice and
accountability governance indicators
than on other aspects of governance. For
example the Press Freedom Index of Reporters
Without Borders ranks Rwanda 156 out of 178
countries for 2012 and Freedom House ranks
Rwanda 178 out of 197 countries in its 2012
World Press Freedom Index. The IREX Media
Sustainability Index indicates a downward trend
since 2008. The constitution upholds a free press
and a number of private radio stations operate
in Rwanda, while a set of new laws are making
their way through Parliament to take forward
a process of media reform including moving

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

towards self-regulation, which allows journalists
to determine what to publish without outside
interference. However, international human
rights organizations have expressed concern
over restrictions on journalists and civil society.
National civil society advocacy is relatively
underdeveloped in Rwanda, perhaps as a
corollary to the firm Government presence.

35

In regard to the horizontal checks and
balances on the exercise of executive
power, Rwanda’s constitution provides for
a robust, autonomous legislative role. For
example, the legislature can override the
President’s objections to ordinary laws with a
two-thirds majority, and the majority of deputies
in the Lower Chamber of Deputies are elected
by universal suffrage while a certain number
have to be women (the upper house, the Senate
is composed of indirectly elected members
and some presidentially appointed members).
A Public Accounts Committee was recently
established to improve financial oversight and
standing committees are playing a growing
role. Nevertheless, Parliament remains a new
institution that is still building its capacity and
potential to act as a channel for national debate
on constituent and party concerns. Its oversight
role is strongly determined by the nature of
political and civil society.

36

From a barely functional judiciary in
1994, progress in capacity building has
been considerable. Recent improvements in
the formal justice system include an increased
presence of defense lawyers at trials, improved
training for court staff, enhanced oversight by an
inspectorate office in the Supreme Court, and
revisions to the legal code. By the end of 2008
there were 266 judges of which 36 percent were

8

women. Bar association membership exceeds
850 advocates (having started with 37 in 1997).
A high backlog of cases in ordinary courts
has been an ongoing challenge for Rwanda’s
justice system. For example in 2007 there were
54,409 backlogged cases against 31,126 tried.
In addition justice has been decentralized and
made more accessible through the Abunzi
mediators at the lowest local Government
‘cell’ level. Nevertheless, in terms of fulfilling its
potential as an oversight institution, according
to Freedom House’s 2010 report on Rwanda, the
judiciary has yet to secure full independence
from the executive.
E. Sustainability
Protecting the environment

37

The combination of Rwanda’s size,
topography, population density, and
natural resource base suggest that the
projected rapid growth rates may present risks
for environmental sustainability. Though direct
investment by the WBG in the environment
sectors is likely to be limited,8 the WBG can play
a significant role in promoting sustainability
along the rapid growth path envisaged in
national strategies. A study has been undertaken
to explore some of the “big picture” trade-offs
that might occur between the pursuit of rapid
growth and the imperative for environmental
sustainability and sound natural resource
management over coming years. It will
also explore where resource constraints
or negative externalities could potentially
hinder growth in key sectors and highlight
how we can mainstream climate resilience
and environmental sustainability though our
sector operations.

The Government has support from other primary development partners in this sector and is unlikely to request IDA resources for this sector.

Accelerating Economic Growth

13

38

Changes
associated
with
rapid
growth paths are likely to have some
consequences for natural resources and the
environment. Sustaining growth of even 7.5
percent per annum implies changes in terms
of how land and other natural resources are
used. There might be negative pressures on the
environment (for example, through increased
pollution) or reduced pressures (for example,
through efficiency gains, reduced pressure on
wood for fuel and through fertility decline).
The study undertaken alerts the WBG to the
potential implications of the growth path and
possible ways that mitigations and sustainability
can be built into the sector operations that
we will be supporting. Annex 6 provides a
preliminary overview of the findings of a rapid
environmental review.

39

Based on the WBG’s ongoing
engagements, the CPIA and other
sources, however, it is clear that the

14

Government of Rwanda takes environmental
challenges seriously. The Government has
already developed environmental, climate
change and green growth strategies and action
plans and is initiating associated reforms and
improvements in procedures and practices.
Ensuring a “Green Economy” is an explicit part of
the growth pillar of the EDPRS 2. A new National
Climate and Environment Fund (FONERWA) is
being set up to facilitate the mainstreaming of
climate change and environment activities, and
guidelines have been developed on adaptation
for several key sectors. A significant knowledge
base is being developed. An environment and
climate change atlas has been published in
2011 and another being drafted on ecosystems
and climate. These strategies and information
base, built on an existing environmental legal/
regulatory system, will be important tools to
guide proposed WBG sectoral investments in a
direction that promotes growth while ensuring
environmental sustainability.

III. Government’s vision and aspirations

40

Rwanda’s purposeful and practical
approach to setting and robustly
pursuing a national vision and then aligning
resources to it is arguably one of the most
distinctive in Africa. The vision and targets are
set out in a series of sectoral, locality-specific,
and overarching strategic development plans.
The clearest aggregation of medium-term goals
is set out in the second Economic Development
and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2). The
elaboration of the EDPRS 2 involved extensive
discussions and consultations with the Rwandan
population, including youth, private sector,
civil society, and academia. A communications
strategy was tailored to solicit feedback and
ideas from citizens from every socioeconomic
category.9 To ensure the broadest possible
participation, two Umuganda days (the last
Saturday of each month when all citizens engage
in community work) were used to solicit citizens’
views and contributions to the EDPRS 2.

41

The overall objectives of the EDPRS
2 are to accelerate private sector-led
growth and further reduce poverty, including
extreme poverty. It seeks to meet these
objectives while reducing aid-dependency and
thus increasing self-reliance by focusing on 4
thematic areas: (a) economic transformation
to achieve high and sustained growth and
restructure the economy toward services and
industry, (b) rural development to bring the
national poverty rate below 30 percent, (c)
productivity and youth employment to ensure
growth and transformation are supported
by appropriate skills, and (d) accountable
governance, to improve service delivery and
increase citizen participation in and satisfaction
with delivery of development. These thematic
areas are supported by 8 foundational issues,10
which are long-term, ongoing priorities for
which substantial progress was already achieved
during EDPRS 1 and 7 cross-cutting issues.11

Communications included a customized EDPRS 2 website, a toll-free SMS line, focus group discussions and country-wide road shows with
brochures, banners, billboards and radio and TV coverage.
The foundational issue areas are macroeconomic stability, demographics, food security, basic education, primary health care, rule of law, PFM,
and decentralization.
11
The cross-cutting areas are capacity building, environment, gender, regional integration, HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases (NCDs),
disaster management, and social inclusion.

Accelerating Economic Growth

15

42

The Government has set demanding
targets across the four thematic areas.
These include targets for economic growth,
reduction of poverty and extreme poverty,
increases in the installed electricity capacity,
promotion of exports, shifts towards a more
urbanized population, enhancements in access
to infrastructure, improvements in the quality of
the labor force, creation of jobs and SMEs, and
improvements in the quality of public services.
Though some targets may not be achieved in
absolute levels, the sense of direction established
by the results framework of the EDPRS 2 accords
strongly with WBG and IMF assessments of the
challenges that need to be tackled over the coming
period. The approach sets a robust framework that
has guided the CPS and results framework.

43

Strategies and strategic targets are taken
seriously in Rwanda, with mechanisms
established to convert medium-term goals
into annual plans, budgets, and specific
performance contracts that hold ministers and
their teams accountable for delivery. The top
government leadership takes measures to ensure
clear delivery targets and monitoring processes
for national strategies. These strategies and
targets are effectively communicated to all levels
of government, as well as to non-state players and
external partners. An annual National Leadership
Retreat convenes the entire government to
review progress and set clear priorities and targets
for the year ahead (refer to Box 1).

44

Taken together, the targets set in the
EDPRS2 represent a highly ambitious
agenda for inclusive growth over the coming
years. In order to achieve middle-income status
by 2020, Rwanda must achieve a targeted
average annual real GDP growth of 11.5 percent

16

between 2012 and 2020. Attainment of the
target would require a significant acceleration
from the already high growth rates in the last
decade. As such, for modeling purposes the
WBG and the IMF are using forecasted rates
more in line with past trends (as used for
example in their Debt Sustainability Analysis and
the recent Joint Staff Advisory Note). Together
the IMF and the World Bank identify two key
challenges to attaining the growth target: (a)
the funding and implementation of public and
private investment in view of prospects for
declining—at least in relative terms—official
external financing; and (b) the sustainability of
planned policies in light of the compression
of public and private consumption that would
be consistent with a re-allocation of public and
private resources into investment.

45

The EDPRS 2 looks to the private sector
to drive growth and job creation over
the medium term. Over the past five years,
improvements in the investment climate
have not unlocked the desired significant
increase in private investment. The private
sector development strategy acknowledges
the challenges involved. The economic
transformation theme of the EDPRS 2 aims to drive
down the cost of doing business by removing
key bottlenecks in infrastructure and energy.
While the EDPRS 2 defines the role of the public
sector as a catalyst for private sector-led growth,
performing this role will require significant
financing, including leveraging public-private
partnerships (PPPs) where feasible. This suggests
a delicate task for Government in prioritizing its
investment programs while taking into account
proper sequencing and linkages between them,
as well as to ensure that adequate financing is
available to support private investment.

46

Meeting export targets will require
accelerated regional integration and
diversification of both products and markets.
The East African Community countries are at
the final stage of adopting an EAC Monetary
Union Protocol, which will set macroeconomic
convergence criteria, among others, as a
precondition for accession to the single currency
area. It will also establish a transition period
toward the single currency area, during which
countries will align their economies to the set
criteria and adjust their policies accordingly.
The Government, already appreciating some
benefits from greater regional integration since
entering the common market in 2009, actively
pursues implementation of the protocol.
Results of a recent “scorecard” show significant
achievements so far.

47

Reproduction of past growth rates alone
will not be enough to reach poverty
reduction targets—a reproduction of past
reductions in inequality is also needed.
Figure 6 shows the combinations of household

consumption growth (horizontal axis) and
inequality reduction (vertical axis) that are
needed to achieve the poverty target (steeper
curve) and extreme poverty target (gentler slope)
by the end of the second EDPRS 2 in 2018.12 In
the absence of redistribution (no reduction in
inequality) household consumption will need
to grow by 3.6 percent per year between 2011
and 2018 to reduce poverty to their target
level of 30 percent. This is higher than both the
growth in consumption observed over the past
decade (2.5 percent) and the growth observed
between 2006 and 2011 (3 percent). However,
if inequality could be reduced at an average
rate of 1 percent per year (the annual rate of
inequality decline between 2006 and 2011),
the poverty target would be attained with
consumption growth of less than 2.3 percent.
Annex 3 provides a fuller analysis.

48

Shaping the Post-2015 agenda, the
WBG Development Committee has
endorsed the global goal of eradicating
extreme poverty within a generation. This

These simulations are based on the poverty curves developed by Ferreira and Leite (2003). The simulations are purely mechanical and we present
them for illustrative purposes. They should be interpreted with caution.

Accelerating Economic Growth

17

targets reducing the proportion of people living
below the international poverty line of US$1.25
per day to no more than 3 percent by 2030.
Not all countries can be expected to meet this
goal, and so it is not a “binding” target in that
sense for Rwanda. But still it is illustrative to at
least consider—what will it take for Rwanda to
seek to meet the ambitious global goal? Using
poverty lines based on national datasets rather
than the international poverty line (US$1.25
per day), projections (see Figure 7) suggest a
similar combination of growth in household
consumption and inequality reduction will be
needed to meet national targets. It will take
a reproduction of past rates of growth and
inequality reduction in order to meet these
global international goals in Rwanda.

49

Clearly
progress
on
inequality
reduction—not
just
growth—will
determine to a large extent whether Rwanda
will meet the poverty targets of the Second
EDPRS. While the poverty targets in the EDPRS
2 are ambitious, they can realistically be attained
if Rwanda keeps up its strong shared growth
performance of the past 6 years. This suggests
that investments that actively seek to raise the
productivity and incomes of the lowest groups
will be needed to approach this target. Emphasis
within the EDPRS 2 on scaling up social protection
and intensifying the rural transformation are
aligned with this challenge. Beyond the need to
tackle inter-household inequality, attention to
within-household disparities will also be important
(including gender inequality, see Box 2).

Box 2: Empowering women
The Government of Rwanda has made significant gains in its commitment to achieving gender equity.
The 2003 Rwandan Constitution enshrines the principle of gender equality by providing 30 percent quotas
for women’s representation in decision-making structures. The Government has also included gender as
a cross-cutting theme in their Vision 2020 and EDPRS. The overall goal is that by 2020 “girls and boys will
have achieved equity of voice, participation, and access to every area of economic growth and poverty
reduction represented in national policy and law”. The specific target areas are:
•
•
•
•
•

Gender equity in halving the proportion of people living below the poverty line by 2015;
Gender equity in a reduced income disparity;
Gender equity in increased GDP per capita;
Gender equity within the increased average GDP growth rate; and
Gender equity in progress toward the MDGs.

There are indications that the status of women is improving in some sectors. Rwanda has a consistently
improving score on the UNDP Gender Inequality Index (positioned at 73 out of 167 countries). In
2013 Rwanda had the world’s highest women’s participation in parliament at 64 percent, up from just
17.1 percent 15 years earlier. The Rwanda National Police Service has achieved 37.5 percent women in
leadership positions. In local-level government, women still are under-represented—only 6.7 percent of
mayors are women—although 43 percent of local government positions and 30 percent of judgeships
are held by women.
Despite successes, women in Rwanda still face challenges. More female-headed households live in
poverty than those headed by males (47 percent compared to 44 percent, respectively). Women’s literacy
rates are lower than men’s (60 percent compared to 70 percent, respectively), which further constrains
already limited opportunities in terms of accessing resources, creating and managing small businesses,
and participating in the overall decision-making processes in the households. And gender-based violence
among women and girls remains an area of serious concern. In 2010 at least 56 percent of women aged
15-49 years had experienced physical or sexual violence. This CPS draws upon the findings of the Bank’s
Gender Assessment (2012) and discusses this and other key analyses to inform the strategy.

IV. Development challenges

50

The Government uses the ambitious
nature of its goals as a driving force
for change. It recognizes that the higher the
ambition, the greater the challenges. To a large
extent, challenges are well described in the
EDPRS 2. During the consultation process for
the EDPRS 2 and in sector working groups, many
discussions have centered on how best to tackle
the challenges.
A. From public-led to private-led growth

51

Accelerating growth and creating
jobs through the intensification and
deepening of the private sector lies at the heart
of the development challenge and implies
significant action at policy and investment
levels. The targets for economic growth,
export growth, and enterprise growth suggest
a significant restructuring of the economy.
Progress in these goals will underpin progress
in the poverty targets to an important degree,
through their implications for rural development
and job creation. The imperative for job creation
is extremely strong; the total non-farm labor force

20

increased from 442,000 in 2001 to 1.4 million in
2011. About 100,000 formal and informal jobs
are currently created each year, which is only half
the annual growth needed to maximize benefits
from the demographic dividend.

52

Despite the strong performance with
respect to the investment climate,
multiple challenges complicate progress. The
private sector is still relatively small and weak,
with a narrow manufacturing base, small financial
sector, and an underdeveloped services sector.
Local business registrations have increased,
but only around 40 percent of these firms are
active. Informality prevails as only 13,000 of
123,000 firms operating are in the formal sector.
Geography, low productivity, and high energy
costs make Rwanda an expensive place for
enterprises dependent on seaports or energyintensive processes. As a small economy, the
domestic market is relatively limited; expanding
markets on a significant scale beyond borders
has been hampered by cross-border tensions
and inefficiencies.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

53

Enterprise surveys highlight access
to finance and availability of land as
the most severe constraints followed by
infrastructure (electricity and transport) and
labor skills. Other issues relate to the arbitrary,
uncertain, and unpredictable way in which
certain areas of regulation are enforced. Issues
that are identified by the private sector (including
during the consultations for this CPS) include tax
administration, post-implementation problems
(e.g. misunderstandings regarding incentives
related to energy and land titles) and potential
competition issues (real or perceived).

54

It will be particularly important that
public investment decisions leverage
private investment to the maximum extent
possible. Recent research by the World Bank
suggests that public investment in Rwanda
still “crowds in” private investment, but at ratios
that are less favorable than in some other
neighboring countries. This indicates that there
is room for improvement in the management of
public investment, in particular with respect to
ensuring robust, independent project selection
processes (including thorough appraisal
and cost benefit analysis) to ensure that the
returns are maximized from scarce investment
resources. Poor public investment choices can
not only crowd out private investment, but also
erode fiscal space and debt sustainability over
time. Attention to smooth implementation will
also be important.
B. Sharing prosperity

55

Ensuring that growth translates into
further poverty reduction will require
directed investment, including cash transfers,
toward improving the incomes of the poorest.
The EDPRS 2 envisages considerable investment
in agriculture—focusing on agricultural

Accelerating Economic Growth

productivity and rural infrastructure—to drive
transformation of livelihoods in rural areas.
Despite recent gains, the move from subsistence
to commercial agriculture remains a challenge.
Food is about 70 percent of output, farm
productivity is low, and plot sizes are small (about
0.3 hectare), leaving it hard to make space for
mainstream commercial agriculture. Irrigation is
not yet widespread; use of improved seed is still
constrained; and, though rising, only one-third
of farmers are using fertilizers.

56

Generating a serious private agribusiness
sector will entail investment in value
chains and agro-processing and a shift
toward higher-value crops, which require
specialized technical know-how and valuechain expertise. The rewards in terms of poverty
reduction and boosting exports could be
considerable however. Tea and coffee already
contribute to half of all exports, involving
500,000 households in coffee production and
60,000 households in tea production. However,
only 29 percent of coffee is washed despite the
60 percent price premium accorded to washed
coffee. Branding, traceability, and certification
are key for developing a viable horticulture
export industry, but low-income farmers will find
these activities costly and will need support.

57

For the poorest groups, expansion and
improvements of the social protection
system will remain critical. A thoughtful
government roadmap embodied in the EDPRS
and National Social Protection Strategy sets out
the key steps toward improving the social
protection system, including the introduction
of stronger targeting mechanisms, a scaleup of coverage, and a determined focus (and
EDPRS target) on promoting an exit from the
poorest categories.

21

C. Financing the development effort

58

At a price tag of Rwanda Francs
(RWF) 9.9 trillion (US$15 billion),
adequate financing of the development
strategy will pose its own challenges of
intensifying domestic revenue collection and
management of external revenue sources.
Despite an improving trend, Rwanda’s tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio at 14.2 percent in 2013
was well below the regional average of 25
percent and the Government has embarked on
a comprehensive tax reform strategy. Boosting
domestic revenue mobilization raises several
challenges; broadening the tax base, introducing
comprehensive tax regimes for agriculture and
mining, and strengthening property taxation
and enhancing revenue administration are
all prerequisites. Given the intensity of the
financing gap and the expected relative decline
in external concessional financing, efforts to
prioritize and sequence public investments by
the Government will be important.
D. Ensuring institutions and capacity keep
pace with growth

59

Managing
the
wide-ranging
consequences of rapid growth will require
flexibility, strong feedback loops, and capacity
to respond to unforeseen developments.
Rapid economic growth is an overwhelmingly
positive force for generating sustainable change
for poor populations. Nevertheless, if targets are
reached—or even nearly reached—the changes
that the Rwandan economy and society will
have undergone as part of this process will be
significant. People will be earning livelihoods
differently from before, living in different places
from before, using their assets (especially land
and human capital) differently from before,
moving around differently, structuring families
differently, consuming differently, aspiring
differently, and relating to other stakeholders

22

—both non-state and state actors—differently.
Natural resources will be used differently as
the economy is dominated less by subsistence
agriculture and more by commercial agriculture
and off-farm activities. As growth becomes
driven more by private sector growth, the role
of the state in the economy will need to adapt,
taking on a role as facilitator more than owner.
Institutions will need to respond to these
changes. Keeping pace with the changes could
be a challenge.

60

Building the capacity of government
staff and institutions will be critical
to managing this change process well.
The strength of capacity at the top levels of
leadership in central government agencies
has not yet cascaded down fully—neither
to the lower levels of seniority in the central
agencies nor to many of the local agencies
that are frontline implementers of policy or
deliverers of services. It will be important for
the National Capacity Building Secretariat to
enhance its facilitation and support to all the
priority sectors (energy, agriculture, private
sector development, environment and natural
resources, urbanization and transport) to
undertake capacity-building diagnostics and to
design the proposed sector capacity building
plans throughout the EDPRS 2 period.

61

Enhancing district-level capacity will
be foundational for achieving goals
associated with the “accountable governance”
pillar of the EDPRS2. This is true particularly
for those goals that strive for greater citizen
participation in the development process and
those related to the quality of service delivery.
The newly approved decentralization policy is an
excellent starting point and implies considerable
efforts in strengthening effectiveness at the
district level and in reforming the mechanics of
center-district relations.

V. Strategic options for the CPS: Leveraging WBG assets

62

Though Government goals and the
associated challenges suggest potential
for considerableWBG engagement, maximizing
impact with limited WBG resources demands
focus and boundaries. The Government maps
the flows of development assistance carefully
and is directive in matching donors and sectoral
financing needs. The mapping provided by
Government provides a useful tool in identifying
the comparative advantage for the WBG and
in the application of selectivity. In defining
the CPS going forward and, in particular, in
deciding where the core of IDA will be spent, the
principles applied in identifying the most fruitful
areas for WBG engagement in Rwanda covered
the following:
• Is there strong alignment with the twin goals
and complementary nationally defined goals for
poverty reduction? Will engagement in this area
unblock major impediments to progress?
• Given the flows of other donor resources and
WBG skills and experience in Rwanda, does WBG
have a comparative advantage in this area that
will allow it to make a difference?

Accelerating Economic Growth

• Does engagement in this area allow WBG to
maximize all three of its institutions in the most
synergistic way?
• Is there demand from the client for engagement
by WBG in this sector?
• What are the risk levels of achieving impact in
this sector, in particular with respect to capacity
constraints on the Government and WBG side?

63

Table 2 summarizes the discussions that
have taken place within the country team,
with the client and with other development
partners with respect to WBG’s potential role
in addressing core development constraints.
The left column lists constraints to achieving key
poverty objectives as identified through WBG
analytical work and Government strategies. Any
sectors that “failed” the first line of screening
with respect to alignment to poverty reduction
(for example, cultural heritage) are left out of the
table. In general, the low scores for comparative
advantage reflect the dominance of other
donors in these sectors and the expectation that
they will continue to finance these sectors at the

23

same level and same high quality. For example,
the combination of global funds and bilateral
financing from USAID in the health sector
suggests little value added in directing IDA
toward the sector. In this respect, a low rating
for comparative advantage does not refer to the
competencies of the WBG in general. Rather it
reflects the contextual, relative advantage of the
WBG given the resources that other donors are
bringing to Rwanda.

64

Based on an analysis of needs and
comparative advantage, the choices of
sector engagement for the WBG align well with
the Government requests. WBG has been asked

to lead the development partners in energy
and urban development sectors, be actively
engaged (but not lead) in the rural development
sector, and to operate through low-transaction
cost modalities in the social protection sector.
The Government also asked that the World Bank
work with DFID, KfW and the EU to support
progress on public financial management (PFM)
and decentralization. IFC believes it will be
able to invest primarily in the financial sector,
supported by both IFC advisory and World Bank
analytical work. Indeed, financing for financial
institutions is likely to be IFC’s main (but far
from only) investment activity in Rwanda in the
medium term.

The analysis suggests the following 3
themes will guide WBG engagement in
Rwanda:
• Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that
is private-sector driven and job creating,
incorporating WBG investments and
analytical work in energy, financial sector
development, urban development, regional
integration, direct investments in the private
sector, public-private partnerships, and
investment climate (including export
competitiveness and other private sector
development policy work);
• Theme 2: Improving the productivity and
incomes of the poor through rural development

and social protection, including investments
in the national safety nets and smaller
investments in activities that promote social
cohesion and peacebuilding, agricultural
productivity (including rural roads), and IFC
investments in horticulture, agribusiness, and
microfinance;
• Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance
through public financial management
and decentralization, including likely IDA
investment in fostering stronger results
in public financial management, fiscal
decentralization, in statistical systems and
open data.

A. Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that
is private-sector driven and job creating

66

Structural transformation is needed to
move the economic growth path from
one that is dominated by ODA-financed
public investment to one that is fully driven
by the private sector. This is an imperative for
sustainability of the growth path but is also vital

Accelerating Economic Growth

for job creation. With an estimated 200,000 people
entering the job market annually, the private
sector will be a primary provider of livelihoods
and an important driver of poverty reduction.
Despite the high scores for a supportive
regulatory environment in the Doing Business
ranking, the private sector is currently still weak
and underdeveloped. The WBG will tackle the

25

key bottlenecks that have restricted private
sector investment through a combination of
IDA investments (in energy, urban development,
and regional integration), IFC investments (in
the financial sector and possibly—crossing over
with the second thematic area—in agribusiness)
and IFC advisory/World Bank analytical work to
strengthen the regulatory framework to increase
predictability and reduce regulatory risks.

shift in the economy. Power prices are high
(despite subsidies) at 22¢ to 24¢ per kilowatthour (kWh) relative to neighbors: tariffs in
Kenya are 15¢ per kWh; Uganda, 17¢ per kwh;
Tanzania, 5¢ per kwh), undermining Rwanda’s
competitiveness. Electricity consumption is
currently about one-tenth of the Sub-Saharan
average, with coverage of about 18 percent of
population.

67

69

A propitious investment climate with
predictable rules that attract investors
and reward them on their own merits is a key
component for ensuring healthy, efficient and
sustainable private sector development. Policies
that ensure open markets, an environment that
reduces entry costs and operational risks, policies
that minimize distortions on the level playing
field, and rules that prevent anticompetitive
business practices are key areas for a growthenhancing market regulatory framework. The
WBG will support the Government of Rwanda to
develop an effective institutional and regulatory
framework to effectively implement competition
and investment policies that foster competitive
markets and productivity.
Energy

68

Why is energy so important for private
sector-led growth? There is significant
survey data from enterprises in Rwanda to
suggest that the high cost and low reliability of
energy is one of the primary bottlenecks to the
enterprise development. Likewise, there is ample
evidence that rural electrification has benefits in
terms of consumption (as small, rural business
activity requires electricity) and human capital
accumulation. Insufficient generating capacity,
limited transmission networks, and high cost of
electricity are major constraints on investment.
There is a clear sense that overcoming this
constraint will bring about a lasting, structural

26

Increased access to electricity is key to
the countries’ poverty reduction and
economic growth and broad-based welfare
gains. The plans for expansion require US$35 million financing per megawatt (MW), or
about US$800 million annually, and will include
both experimental (methane) and high-risk
(geothermal) energy sources. The current
installed electricity generation capacity is
about 110MW, with available capacity of about
95MW and peak demand of 90MW. The system
is operating without a reserve margin resulting
in poor reliability and availability of supply. The
Government has ambitious plans to expand
the generation capacity to meet the country’s
projected demand. The plan is to increases
total installed capacity over the next 5 years
from 110MW in 2013 to about 563MW by 2018,
with connections forecast to leap from 200,000
to 1,200,000 and biomass use to drop from 86
percent to 65 percent by 2017. These targets
are not beyond reach; a committed capacity
of 76.5MW is expected to be commissioned by
June 2014. Memoranda of Understanding have
been signed for an additional capacity of about
200MW in the next 4-5 years.

70

To leverage funding for energy
generation, the Government proposes
mostly private sector-led investment. This
offers the WBG opportunity to leverage funding
and enhance collaboration among the WBG in

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

supporting increased electricity generation.
There is also need to balance public investments
in the sector without crowding out the private
sector. For a number of these investments,
discussions are advanced and some projects
already under construction. In some instances,
the Government may require support to reach
financial closure on some of the proposed
generation investments, which might include a
combination of IDA partial risk guarantees and
MIGA guarantees, IFC loans as well as other WBG
financial products. In addition, IDA resources may
be required to undertake upstream assessments,
such as feasibility studies and transaction
advisory services, especially geothermal due
diligence subject to confirmation of the resource.
IFC is tentatively predicting investments in
the energy sector of approximately US$30
million over the CPS period. IFC investment
climate activities will also support private sector
participation in renewable energy, including the
Rwanda Development Board (RDB), Rwanda
Utility Regulatory Authority (RURA), and Ministry
of Infrastructure (MININFRA) to strengthen
capacity to deal with investment proposals.
It will also expand the work on feed in tariffs
currently prevailing for hydro, solar and smallscale biomass in order for more standard power
purchases to be developed. MIGA’s traditional
political risk insurance coverage against transfer
and convertibility restrictions, expropriation,
breach of contract and war and civil disturbance
can help leverage cross-border investment,
in particular for critical infrastructure, such as
power, water and transportation. During the CPS
period, MIGA will actively look for opportunities
in these sectors as well as in agribusiness.

13

71

In the long-term, the integration of
Rwanda’s power sector within the East
African Power Pool is indispensable. Rwanda is
a member of the Nile Basin Initiative and the East
Africa Power Pool. However, apart from its share
in existing regional hydro plants,13 Rwanda is not
connected to any regional transmission network
apart from the small bilateral power interchanges
with Uganda. Rwanda’s location would allow it to
benefit from the interconnected power network
within the proposed East African Power Pool.
In light of Rwanda’s current high-generation
costs and energy resource constraints, regional
integration would unlock the benefits of regional
hydropower, geothermal, wind and natural
gas resources, substantially reducing overall
generation investment costs. Several regional
interconnection lines are at various stages of
development; Rwanda-Uganda and UgandaKenya are expected to be commissioned in 2015
while other interconnections between RwandaTanzania, Rwanda-Burundi, and Rwanda-DRC
will form part of the Rusumo and Rusizi hydro
projects. Rwanda has initiated discussions to
import 50MW from Uganda and has made initial
contacts with Ethiopia.

72

With an emphasis on using private
sector resources for generation, the
comparative advantage of IDA may well
be to focus on strengthening the overall
performance of the sector and on distribution,
areas unlikely to attract the private sector.
Recent changes to the institutional structures—
the separation of the former utility into two
distinct entities to cover electricity and water
separately—suggests the need for considerable

Presently Rwanda purchases power from the Rusizi I plant (with import capacity of 3.5 MW) of SNEL of DRC, and Rusizi II (with import capacity
of 12 MW), owned by Sinelac (jointly owned by Rwanda, DRC, and Burundi).

Accelerating Economic Growth

27

institutional strengthening. A recent grid audit
study highlights many important priorities for
investment in order to improve the functionality
and expand the outreach of the network. It
provides a solid starting point for possible IDA
investment in this area.
Urban development

73

Why is urban development a priority
for the inclusive growth agenda? In a
region with low levels of urbanization, Rwanda
is among the least urbanized countries in SubSaharan Africa with an urbanization rate of about
15 percent. Of the roughly 1.6 million urban
dwellers, about 1 million live in Kigali. From
previously high average annual growth rates
of 9 percent (due in large part to the influx of
post-genocide returnees), Kigali’s growth has
decelerated to a still- rapid 4 percent per year.
The remainder of the urban population (roughly
600,000) is dispersed across provincial towns
in 27 districts. These are small urban centers,
and not more than 10 towns have sufficient
density to truly reflect urban attributes and
functions. The most viable towns are located
near borders, at the intersection of national
roads leading to borders, or in the vicinity of
Kigali. Rubavu, Musanze, Muhanga and Huye are
growing rapidly. Despite a current low level of
urbanization, the country is poised for an urban
transformation.

74

The Government of Rwanda aims to
expand the share of the industrial sector
from 16 percent to 26 percent of GDP by 2020
while continuing to improve the productivity
and value addition in the agriculture sector.
While agriculture employs 80 percent of the
workforce and represents 33 percent of GDP, the
Government’s industrial policy aims to sustain 8
percent annual growth and to create 1.8 million
non-farm jobs by 2020. Given land constraints,

28

this goal must be met through expansion of
commerce, industry, construction, and services
sectors in urban centers.

75

The Government is pursuing a policy
of more balanced, sustainable urban
development. Kigali has emerged as Rwanda’s
national business, service, industrial and
administrative hub; it accommodates 30
percent of employment and 10 percent of the
population. Within this environment, however,
the Government is concerned about the
potential negative consequences of economic
and population concentration in one city,
which can lead to economic weaknesses in
other regions; regional social imbalances across
the country; and congestion, pollution, slums,
and other negative externalities—within the
primary city—that can become unmanageable.
Therefore maintaining the attractiveness of
Kigali while developing the economic potential
of secondary cities is the Government’s central
challenge of this policy. The urban strategy is
therefore centered on developing six secondary
urban centers for a more balanced urban
growth. The role and function of these towns
will depend on their size, but their development
can have a significant impact on developing the
economy and reducing migration to Kigali, if
managed properly.

76

The policy to spur urbanization also
has the potential to reduce poverty.
Though analytical work on the poverty impacts
of urbanization is scarce, ongoing work in
the Rwanda Poverty Assessment suggests
positive impacts. Between 2006 and 2011, poor
households in urban areas were 14 percentage
points more likely to exit poverty than poor
households in rural areas. The rate of chronic
poverty (households who were below the
poverty line in both 2006 and 2011) was also

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

three times lower for urban (14 percent) than
for rural households (42 percent).14 In addition,
urbanization is typically linked to lower fertility,
higher female labor force participation, and
higher investments in children’s education.

77

The WBG work in the urban sector in
Rwanda is in the earliest stages, making
the prediction of future investments imprecise.
The team is exploring the use of IDA in providing
the necessary infrastructure for the sustainable
development of secondary cities. This would
incorporate work that supports the goals set
out in the private sector development strategy
and would also focus on the governance
environment for effective management of
secondary cities. IFC is currently considering
investments in housing units for Kigali and the
possibility of opening a mortgage finance facility.
IFC has also been investigating the possibility of
a PPP transaction for the bulk water supply for
Kigali. Though design of the entry points for the
WBG is still preliminary, the opportunities for a
strongly collaborative effort between IDA and
the IFC are clearly present.

78

IFC is rolling out some of its IT-based
activities to cities across the country as
part of its investment climate work. This will
include establishment of on-line construction
permit applications at the two or three of the
6 secondary cities with sufficient absorptive
capacity. One stop centers for construction permit
administration are being established in each
location through the Rwanda Housing Authority
(RHA) to handle the predicted increased number
of applications for construction permits and
manage the lack of resources at the district level.
Financial sector

79

Why the focus on the financial sector?
Insufficient access to affordable credit is
listed as the biggest constraint for businesses
in the enterprise survey. Figure 8 illustrates how
constrained borrowing from commercial banks
is relative to other countries in the sub-region.
Widespread informality hinders financial sector
growth, and only 7 percent of adults are covered
by a credit bureau. Bank penetration, saving rates,
uptake of microfinance products, and mobile
platforms are all low compared to regional peers.

Reduction, The Role of Rural Diversification and Secondary Towns (Policy Research Working Paper 6422, World Bank, April 2013).

Accelerating Economic Growth

29

80

The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA have all
been active in the financial sector. The
World Bank’s role has been more through the
provision of technical assistance and analytical
work than through investment; the first Financial
Sector Development Plan (FSDP) provided
extensive guidance to the BNR in many aspects
of financial sector development, and about 90
percent of the recommendations (of which there
were several hundred) have been implemented.
The Cabinet has now approved the second FSDP
(FSDP II). Both FSDPs were based on Financial
Sector Assessment Programs carried out jointly
by the World Bank and the IMF. The World Bank
is providing considerable support to FSDP II
implementation using programmatic trust funds.

81

Through a US$2 million FIRST-funded
technical
assistance
program,15
the legal and regulatory framework and
supervisory capacity of the financial sector
are being strengthened and Rwanda’s crisis
preparedness, resilience, and financial stability
are being improved. Financial inclusion for
individuals as well as micro, small, and mediumsize enterprises (MSMEs) will be supported
through technical assistance provided through
the Financial Inclusion Support Framework
(US$2-3 million). This program will address
demand as well as supply-side challenges,
stretching from financial education and
consumer protection to support for legal
and regulatory reforms related to financial
inclusion and improving schemes for
supporting MSME financing.

82

For the IFC, the financial sector provides
an opportunity for investments in small
enterprises. Opportunities for IFC to invest

15

30

directly in enterprises that seek to operate in
Rwanda have been constrained by the small
size of these projects. The bulk of the private
sector comprises small firms who are making
small investments that are not bankable for IFC
participation. IFC anticipates investments in the
financial sector in the order of US$20 million a
year over the CPS period. The approach would
be to deepen the engagement with local banks
and micro-finance institutions, leveraging both
advisory and investment services to expand
finance (both in volume and in range of products)
to MSMEs with a full range of trade and supply
chains, long-term and local currency products.
The Access to Finance engagement will focus
on MSME bankability and risk management. IFC
will also consider engagement in the housing
finance market.

83

Recognizing that the investment rate is
insufficient to drive the rates of growth
that are foreseen, IFC also aims to provide
support in developing capital markets. The
current reliance on imported capital (government
debt, donors, foreign direct investment) implies
foreign exchange risk for those seeking finance.
Domestic capital markets can provide more
reliable financing for the private sector and could
be a source of lower-cost, longer-term local
currency financing for Rwandan and possibly for
regional players too small to issue in Nairobi or
Johannesburg. IFC will provide advice on capital
market development, with the Access to Finance
team providing support to develop capital
market infrastructure (including rating agencies,
custodians, electronic trading platform, regulatory
capacity, corporate governance and brokers). IFC
Treasury is in discussion with Government to
launch a local currency bond.

B. Theme 2: Improving the productivity
and incomes of the poor through rural
development and social protection

84

As Bank analysis of poverty shows, growth
alone will not be sufficient to reach
poverty targets. International and national goals
for poverty reduction are only attainable with a
strategy that builds the incomes of the poorest
quintiles and ensures that the prosperity that
is generated by growth is adequately shared.
Activities under this theme are chosen to deliver
maximum impact on the incomes of the poorest
and most vulnerable groups in Rwanda.
Rural development

85

Close to 80 percent of the Rwandan
labor force depends on agriculture for
a living. The fastest and most effective way
to raise the standards of living of the majority
of the population is therefore to increase
incomes from agriculture. The improvements in
agriculture have played a major role in the rapid
poverty reduction Rwanda experienced over
16

the past decade. 35 percent of the reduction
in poverty in Rwanda can be attributed to
increased agricultural production while an
extra 10 percent can be explained by increased
commercialization of agricultural produce (refer
to Figure 3). This makes agriculture the single
most important driver of the 14 percentagepoint drop in poverty over the past decade.

86

Between 2000 and 2011, aggregate
agricultural production almost doubled,
with most of the increase happening since
2008 (Figure 9). This can be traced back to the
Government’s renewed focus on agriculture
under the first EDPRS (2008-12). Since 2008, the
Government has embarked on an ambitious
plan to modernize and raise the productivity of
agriculture, which has led to significant gains
in productivity of the selected priority crops:
between 2008 and 2011, yields (production per
hectare) of maize increased by 225 percent, rice
by 34 percent, wheat by 129 percent, cassava by
90 percent, potatoes by 66 percent, and bananas
by 62 percent.16

87

Intensifying agricultural productivity will
remain central in the IDA program. Given
the limited scope to expand cultivable land area,
improved productivity of agricultural land is
critical for income generation. IDA will support
a whole suite of interventions aimed to boost
productivity based around soil conservation and
land husbandry. This will include progressive and
radical terraces, soil fertility management, and soil
erosion control. It will also include measures that
reinforce farmer resilience to shocks (irrigation
and water management), the expansion of
agricultural mechanization (currently stands at
12 percent), and the optimization of inputs to
improve soil fertility and seed quality.

88

Investments will also facilitate a
transition from subsistence to more
commercial farming practices, tackling underemployment in rural areas and raising rural
incomes. IDA will support strengthening the
enabling environment to attract and retain
private investment, encourage entrepreneurship,
and facilitate market access. This will include
modalities to increase production via facilitating

32

contract farming, satellite farming, consolidated
land leasing, and cooperatives. Public-private
partnerships and risk management in value
chains would be supported. Priority value chains,
both agricultural food and export crops, will be
supported along with strengthening crossborder trade channels. Support will be provided
for whole value chains from research, planting
material, production, extension, post-harvest,
value addition in processing, and market analysis
of supply and demand. Support will also be
provided to expanding both the provision of
and access to agriculture finance. Key marketoriented infrastructure, including irrigation, postharvest handling and storage, and rural feeder
roads will be supported to facilitate greater
production and market access.

89

Nutrition components in WBG agriculture
work will remain, given the persistent
challenge of child malnutrition in rural areas.
IDA will support food-insecure households
in nutritious home garden practices and
diversifying food production by scaling-up the
current kitchen gardens program, promoting

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

intercropping, and developing and expanding
bio-fortified food crops.

90

IFC intends to focus advisory services
and possible investments on the
development of horticulture and other
agribusiness ventures. While IFC is aware of
the obstacles, it remains hopeful that potential
transactions with sponsors will materialize. MIGA
looks to support new projects in the agribusiness
sector for which it has an active pipeline. IFC is
considering investment in the tea sector and
currently providing advisory services. IFC also
expects to be involved in the provision of financial
services to the rural sector through the financing
of a greenfield microfinance institution as well as
through conventional financial services.
Social protection

91

Rwanda has made important gains in
protecting the most vulnerable groups
by stabilizing their livelihoods and providing
many with an exit from poverty. IDA’s support
under this CPS period will focus on consolidating
past progress while introducing and scaling
up measures that are fundamental to further
strengthening of Rwanda’s social protection
system. This support will be fully aligned with
Rwanda’s 2013 National Social Protection
Strategy and the 2013 EDPRS 2, and carried out
in close coordination with the other main donors
in the social protection sector.

92

IDA will support expanded coverage
of Rwanda’s social protection system,
notably the flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge
Program (VUP). This program was launched
in 2008 as the principal tool for reaching the
poor and extreme poor and fostering an exit
from poverty. The program has four main

Accelerating Economic Growth

components: (a) direct support cash transfer
program to support extremely poor labor
constrained households; (b) public works
component to provide wage-based temporary
employment to poor households; (c) financial
services for the poor; and (d) community
sensitization and capacity building. The VUP
direct support cash transfer program is present
in 58 percent of sectors and currently serves
over 44,000 households; the VUP public works
program is present in 43 percent of sectors and
currently serves over 89,000 households.

93

An ambitious, ongoing expansion of VUP
program coverage will be a core area
of Bank support. This expansion of coverage
will be informed by strengthened poverty
targeting to ensure that those most in need
are served. Continued reforms to the poverty
targeting system will be supported to ensure
the prioritization of the poorest households,
coupled with a priority expansion to sectors in
the poorest 30 percent of districts.

94

Reforms will also include a focus on
early childhood development to help
tackle the issue of inter-generational poverty,
ensuring a strong base for Rwanda’s future
development. Malnutrition affects over 40
percent of children under age 5 in Rwanda,
and poverty is disproportionally concentrated
among children.
Ensuring sustainable
graduation from poverty requires investments
in productivity, beginning in the earliest years.
These reforms will focus on the complements
between income support and behavioral
changes among parents to ensure that children
receive both appropriate protection and are
supported to make needed investments in
health, nutrition and cognitive stimulation.

33

95

Support will also include a continued
focus on strengthening core service
delivery elements central to the effective
management and improved harmonization
of Rwanda’s social protection system. This will
include a focus on an improved management
information system, a strengthened beneficiary
registry, and improved payment systems in line
with global good practice. It will also include a
continued focus on increased harmonization
and transparency across the main social
protection programs, notably VUP, the Genocide
Survivors Support Fund (FARG), the Rwanda
Demobilization and Reintegration Program,
and the Decentralization Funding Program.
An emphasis on performance management,
evaluation, and learning will connect support for
reforms to analytical work on poverty, and will
include work using the Integrated Household
Living Condition (EICV) Survey to assess the
benefit incidence and contributions of the
flagship VUP program to poverty reduction.

34

96

Neither IFC nor MIGA are likely to
be heavily involved in the social
protection sector, but IFC’s engagement in
the microfinance sector and support for MSME
through conventional bank financing provides
part of the support needed as people exit out of
social protection.

97

Beyond the poverty–targeted safety net,
smaller amounts of IDA are likely to be
targeted towards other vulnerable groups.
This includes work to scale up a successful onestop shop for victims of gender-based violence
across the nation. It also involves a continuation
of highly successful work with ex-combatants
who had been fighting in eastern DRC against
the Rwandan state. The latter provides support
to ex-fighters seeking to give up weapons and
resume more peaceful livelihoods and ensures
that they have the tools and resources to
reintegrate effectively into their communities.

C. Theme 3: Supporting accountable
governance through public financial
management and decentralization

98

Literature indicates that decentralization,
done well, brings benefits to populations
in terms of quality of service delivery and a
stronger match between services needed
and services provided. Even with a decade
of positive developments, the Government
recognizes that much remains to be done
to reach the country’s goals in terms of
democratic, participatory, local governance
and effective citizen-centered service delivery.
One of key priorities in the EDPRS 2 is to further
improve the quality of service delivery through
improved citizen participation. This will require
greater administrative capacity (building
skills, planning, M&E and PFM systems) and
strengthened accountability for performance
at the both central and subnational level.
Subnational capacity building and PFM
are considered foundational cross-cutting
issues that need to be addressed to improve
decentralized service delivery.

Accelerating Economic Growth

99

Low volumes of revenues and a weak
link between availability of district-level
resources and service delivery indicators are
major challenges for fiscal decentralization in
Rwanda. A powerful argument for decentralizing
responsibility for service delivery to subnational
governments is their proximity to and
understanding of local needs. Sufficient fiscal
resources and discretion over service delivery
responsibilities are core features of effective
decentralization, but discretionary revenues
(sum of block grants and own revenues) in
Rwanda constitute only 30 percent of total
revenues. Earmarked transfers, over which
subnational governments generally have limited
control, account for more than 60 percent of
total revenues. Service delivery indicators are
only partially taken into account in the current
allocation formulas.

100

Progress
on
administrative
decentralization varies across sectors.
The Government recognizes the need to
improve the clarity of roles and responsibilities
between national and subnational entities while

35

deepening the overall devolution of power.
Beyond clarifying roles, however, there is an
overwhelming need for strengthened capacity
at subnational levels; there are challenges in
recruiting, attracting, and retaining staff even
in central government, but the constraints at
subnational level are particularly trenchant.17
These gaps affect priority sectors for service
delivery, such as agriculture.

101

There is an acknowledged need for
further political decentralization, in
particular intensifying citizen participation,
expanding the role of civil society
organizations, and encouraging fiduciary
accountability. The Citizens Report Card exercise
(2012) revealed that citizen participation was
particularly weak in areas such as participation in
the district budgetary process (27 percent). One
such participation mechanism, the Joint Action
Development Forum through, for example, the
broader use of ICT and community radio, could
be backed up by stronger efforts to inform
citizens on their rights to participate and by
a legal framework for access to information.
Fiduciary accountability systems at local
government level require significant attention;
weak internal controls in financial management
and reporting are identified by the 2010 PEFA.18

102

The Government has requested
inclusion in the Bank’s Global
Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA)
program. A call for proposals focused on the
promotion of social accountability in service
delivery resulted in several applications, though
none from Rwanda has yet been successful.
Government and Bank-financed investments
alike would benefit from increased monitoring
and oversight by non-state stakeholders.

103

There are ongoing discussions with the
Government regarding IDA support to
Government’s efforts to promote accountable
governance. Building on achievements made
through the decentralized service delivery
policy operation in 2013, a team is preparing
a Program for Results (PforR) operation that
would drive results in areas of public financial
management, fiscal decentralization, statistical
capacity, and open data. Government strategies
and expenditure programs to promote
accountable governance in these areas already
exist and the team is currently constructing
realistic disbursement-linked indicators from
these strategies. IDA’s work on accountable
governance will be oriented, to a considerable
degree, toward improving state effectiveness in
local-level government. Synergies emerge in IFC’s
plans to decentralize its progress in investment
climate work to local authorities. While the
Government has made impressive strides in
passing legislation that improves the investment
climate, implementation can be patchy at local
government levels (in particular with respect to
local tax administration and some elements of
investor aftercare). Transparent regulations, firm
feedback mechanisms, and capacity building
for local offices that deliver services to the
private sector will be an important part of the
investment climate work going forwards.
D. Across the three themes

104

The process of preparing this CPS has
been a joint one; and, though business
plans are not firmed up yet, there are a number
of concrete ideas on collaborative work
among the WBG institutions. IFC’s likely focus
on investments in horticulture/agribusiness,
the financial sector and the infrastructure
sectors (especially energy) provide a sound

The National Skills Audit in 2009 identified a 60 percent skills gap in the country and a serious shortage of human capital in the public sector
with gaps concentrated in the professional cadre.

According to the Auditor General’s Report for Districts of 2011, none of 30 districts received a clean audit.

basis for productive synergies within the WBG.
Areas of cooperation include water supply, the
power sector and agriculture. Increased use of
MIGA guarantees offers reassurance for foreign
investors, including investors into publicprivate partnerships, and thus can support the
Government’s efforts to attract foreign direct
investment into the country. During the CPS
period, MIGA will continue to seek opportunities
to support private investments into Rwanda, in
particular in EDPRS 2 target areas. In addition,
MIGA’s Small Investment Program offers political
risk insurance that would be appealing to
smaller and medium-sized investment in the
agribusiness and tourism sectors. There are,
however, limitations in the extent to which
IFC and MIGA can “lead the market” since it is
the existence of domestic and international
sponsors looking to do specific deals that largely
determine how their business volumes develop.
Regional integration: Foundation for future
growth

105

Rwanda’s size and location will
mean that stronger integration with
regional economies will be vital for further
growth. There are two elements to this. The
first relates to the need to expand markets for
potential investors to turn “land-locked” into
“land-linked” in the interests of competitiveness.
Countries of the region represent potential
markets for exports, managers of transport
corridors, and facilitators of cross-border trade.
Secondly, regional integration and cross-border
investments will hopefully bring with it greater
political stability and security in the region.

106

Rwanda has expressed its interest in a
number of cross-border investments
in the Great Lakes region to make use of
regional IDA resources. These include the
financing of hydropower generation on the
Accelerating Economic Growth

borders with DRC and Burundi (Rusizi 1, 2,
and 3) and improved transport connections
(for example, the rehabilitation of Kamembe
airport in the south-west, which serves a
largely regional market). IFC and MIGA are also
interested in engaging in such projects where
a role for the private sector exists (for example,
the Rusizi 3 Power Generation Project). Some of
IFC’s Rwanda-based clients already serve both
the domestic market and those of neighboring
countries, particularly eastern DRC.

107

A prerequisite for regional integration
and cross-border investment is
regional peace and security. Last year’s signing of
the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework
for the Great Lakes Region, the historic visit by
the UN Secretary General and WBG President,
and the recent defeat of one of many rebel
groups in eastern DRC all provide a call for more
stability in the region. However, an estimated
1,200 members of the Forces Démocratiques de
Libération du Rwanda (FDLR) remain outside of
Rwanda, primarily in eastern DRC. The continued
presence in eastern DRC of FDLR and Rwandese
associated with the 1994 Genocide is an ongoing
destabilizing factor in the region and remains of
great concern to the Government of Rwanda.
IDA continues support to the Government in
demobilizing Rwandan combatants fighting in
eastern DRC and providing adequate resources
to ensure ex-combatants reintegrate peacefully
into their communities.

108

Looking East, Rwanda has expressed
interest in a number of projects that
could provide faster access to the sea or
more reliable access to affordable energy.
The longer-term health of the energy sector in
Rwanda, with some initiatives underway, will
require that they are able to purchase power
from the sub-region. Likewise, improving

37

the functionality of transport corridors could
enhance the competitiveness of Rwanda-based
businesses. A pipeline for possible projects in
the EAC is under preparation.

109

IDA support to regional integration
is strongly backed by the work of the
wider WBG. Beyond IFC and MIGA engagement
in investments in cross-border, the investment
climate work will continue with a tax law
compliance project to improve the ease of
doing business within the EAC and support on
addressing legal inconsistencies with the EAC
common market protocol as identified through
the Common Market Scorecard.
Maximizing externalities for the
development agenda

110

Selectivity implies limited activity in
some sectors that are of priority to
reducing poverty (refer to Table 2). The process
of mapping donor financing to sectors results in
a careful allocation of external financing across
the Government’s development goals and

38

objectives. Annex 7 (and associated Tables 15
and 16) demonstrates the division of labor across
donors and gives confidence that other sources
of funds are being channeled into sectors where
IDA is less active. Human development sectors,
for example, are well-financed through multiple
other sources.

111

Inclusion of particular lenses across the
WBG portfolio may help to maximize
externalities for the development agenda and
ensure that selectivity does not result in critical
omissions from the WBG. We do not foresee
new standalone IDA investments in either skill
development, ICT or climate resilience, but
recognize the opportunities these sectors offer
for a sustainable growth path. As part of the CPS
preparation process, environment, education
and ICT teams have advised on ways in which
operations in priority sectors could seek to
mainstream these issues across the portfolio. In
the case of climate resilience, a study has been
prepared that identifies the specific entry points
under each sector for IDA engagement.

VI. Implementation for results

112

The Rwanda country program as a
whole has a strong track record (the
Completion Report rates achievement of
objectives as “satisfactory”), and the portfolio
is currently performing well (as it has done
in the past). There are no national IDA projects
performing below a “moderately satisfactory”
rating. The Government does not appreciate
poorly performing projects and, in general, is
swift to take action before projects become
categorized as problematic. The Government’s
drive to deliver applies as much to IDAfinanced operations as to domestically financed
investments and the implementation of the
portfolio benefits from the Government’s focus
on results.
A. Lessons learned

113

A number of features have
underpinned the strong performance
of the portfolio and provide positive lessons for
the future. The Completion Report highlights the
importance of strong Government engagement
in the operations and investments. Operations in

Accelerating Economic Growth

Rwanda are strongly directed by client demand,
and this serves as a good foundation for solving
problems as they arise during implementation.
The move in the previous CAS toward fewer
larger operations that were highly selective in
terms of sectors of engagement allowed WBG
to concentrate resources on achieving impact.
This is an approach that has been carried
through to this CPS. An effective architecture
for Government-donor dialogue has assisted
donors to avoid some of the pitfalls of duplication
that exist in other countries and has actively
promoted strong collaborative mechanisms
across donors.

114

The draft Completion Report has
captured lessons where projects
have not performed so well. For many
projects, procurement processes become a
bottleneck. The lack of skills and high turnover
in procurement staffing on the government side
requires constant hand-holding by Bank staff to
avoid delays. On the Bank side, the lack of skills
based in the Rwanda office limits participation

39

by procurement staff in Bank missions and
undermines efficient mission planning. The
procurement team in the Rwanda office is
currently being strengthened to better tackle
the workload. Investments managed by countrybased task team leaders tend to perform better
than those led from a distance. National projects,
which tend to perform much better than
regional projects, are more likely to be managed
from within country and in part because they
tend to be simpler in design.

115

There has been less success than
foreseen in mainstreaming capacity
building across the portfolio. In practice the
portfolio has tended to deliver on capacity
building more with respect to implementing
WBG investments than tackling more systemic
skill deficits. This CPS is taking a more deliberate
approach to integrating skills building across the
operational portfolio.

116

Consistent with their positions on
bilateral budget support, some
shareholders became less supportive of
delivering IDA to Rwanda through budget
support. Until recently, budget support has been
a highly effective instrument for the delivery
of predictable, flexible financing to a reformminded government that spent the resources
well. This trend changed last year, when
several bilateral development partners either
suspended or delayed their budget support. This
sudden switch in position brought with it delays
to delivery of IDA that in turn caused severe fiscal
difficulties. Though the revenue shortfalls were
well managed by the Government, subsequent
budget cuts have taken their toll in the form of
depressed growth rates.

117

Given the change in attitudes towards
budget support, the Government has
asked the World Bank to consider alternative,

40

more predictable modalities for delivering
IDA in the future. This new partnership strategy
anticipates different combinations of instruments
that might both protect the Government from
volatility in financing flows and, at the same
time, still offer some flexibility in the financing
that is delivered. While the previous CAS was
anchored around budget support, this new
CPS proposes less emphasis on development
policy instruments. In its place, the Government
has requested that WBG disburse part of their
IDA17 allocation in the form of program for
results (PforR) operations. While the previous
CAS disbursed 66 percent in the form of budget
support, this CPS is likely to disburse the same
proportion as a mix of PforR and development
policy operations.
B. WBG portfolio

118

The current IDA portfolio in Rwanda
comprises 8 IDA projects and 3 budget
support operations with net commitment
of $575 million with undisbursed balance
of $328 million, as of mid-April 2014. With
the inclusion of trust funded operations, the
number of projects rises to 9, net commitments
to US$640 million and the undisbursed balance
to US$355 million. Rwanda also participates in 5
regional projects with a national commitment
amount of at least US$189 million. Annex 10
provides an overview of the portfolio. IDA16
allocation for Rwanda was SDR400 million which
is approximately US$617 million, a 54.7 percent
increase from IDA15 (SDR258.5 million).

119

IFC has 10 deals outstanding in
Rwanda with committed volume
of US$38.34 million. IFC envisages that its
investments will rise to US$120 million by
the end of the CPS period, the bulk of which
would be in the financial sector. IFC expects to
engage in the financial sector through a local

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

currency credit line and local currency bond
issue and to support the establishment of a
microfinance bank. In the infrastructure sector,
IFC has identified likely support to the Rusizi 3
power-generation project, Lake Kivu methane
extraction projects, and Kigali Bulk Water Supply.
With respect to manufacturing, IFC is considering
investment for a mix-use commercial building
in Kigali. In agribusiness, IFC intends to support
the tea sector and horticulture either with
direct investments and advice, or indirectly
through partner banks. IFC’s Advisory Services
portfolio has been highly valued; the Rwanda
Entrepreneurship Development Program, the
Rwanda Investment Climate Program, and the
Efficient Security Markets Initiative (ESMID) have
been particularly useful.

120

MIGA currently has two active
(KivuWatt and Bakhresa Grain
Milling) in Rwanda with total gross exposure
of US$110.1 million. MIGA remains open for
business in Rwanda across all of its political
risk insurance product lines, including Transfer
Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract,
and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the
Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.
C. Proposed lending and knowledge work

121

IDA allocations for the CPS period
have not yet been determined and
remain indicative. However, the assumption
made during CPS preparation is that allocations
going forward will be similar to those in the
past. As such, the team is expecting to commit

approximately US$200-250 million a year during
IDA1719, likely spread across three investment
operations, 2 PforR operations, and 1 series
of three development policy operations.
Proposed lending for the coming year is
presented in Table 3. Actual allocations will
depend on (a) total IDA resources available; (b)
the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita,
and population; (c) the terms of IDA assistance
(grants/credits) and the allocation deductions
associated with Multi-lateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) annual debt service foregone; (d) the
performance, other allocation parameters, and
IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers;
and (e) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

122

In Rwanda, with a results-oriented
leadership, it seems sensible to re-

balance the portfolio to disburse against
measurable and verifiable results. The
agriculture sector and decentralization agenda
are strong candidates for trying this approach
to IDA delivery, which is as yet untested in
Rwanda. Two operations are already under
preparation. It is hoped that the tighter linkage of
financing to results will give all Board members
confidence that IDA is being used for delivery of
developmental goals.

123

Tracking results, whether at CPS or
project level, requires strong statistical
systems which can generate high-quality data in
a timely fashion. The building blocks for a sound
statistical system are largely in place in Rwanda,
with a strong statistical agency that conducts
high-quality household surveys (Box 3). These

Box 3: If you can’t count it, it doesn’t count...
The National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) was established in 2005. Since its inception, NISR
implemented two Integrated Household Living Conditions Surveys (EICV), two Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) and one interim-DHS, two Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability and Nutrition
Analysis Surveys, one Population and Housing Census, three National Agricultural Surveys and many
smaller surveys covering specific topics. The Institute also produces on a regular basis the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) and a host of other routine economic statistics. Together with development partners, the World
Bank is supporting the NISR in its rapid development through its contribution to the basket fund for the
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics.
NISR produces core economic statistics (national accounts and CPI) on a regular and timely basis. The
CPI is published each month on the NISR website. National accounts are on quarterly basis and published
on the NISR website by the 15th of the previous month of the subsequent quarter. The National Bank of
Rwanda produces monetary statistics on a monthly basis. Monetary statistics are regularly published on the
BNR website while trade statistics are available upon request. Fiscal data are produced on quarterly basis by
the Ministry of Finance (MINECOFIN). Since 2012, they are unregularly published on the MINECOFIN website
NISR has been remarkably constant in the production of key data. Censuses are implemented every
10 years (last one in 2012) and every five years there has been a large socioeconomic household survey
(EICV) with data on poverty (2001, 2006, and 2011). The next poverty survey is scheduled for 2013/14. DHS
surveys were implemented in 2000, 2005, and 2010, with an interim one in 2008. The next DHS is planned
for 2014/15.

Should the commitments proposed in FY15 be high relative to actual allocations, there may be scope to accommodate these higher levels
through front-loading from FY16 and FY17.

F Y 2 0 1 4 - 2 0 1 8 • country partnership strategy for R WA N D A

surveys provide data on many of the results
that are important for tracking progress against
Government strategies. Most notably, there is
a Living Standards Management Study (LSMS)style survey about to go into the field (the third
in its series), and another survey planned for
2016/17. As such, WBG will be well placed to track
important social and poverty outcomes over the
timeframe of this CPS framework. The WBG will
continue to support the development of these
systems over the framework period, including
improving the quality of administrative data that
might be important for measuring results in any
PforR operations.

124

The country team proposes a mid-term
review of the five-year CPS after 2.5
years. This will provide an opportunity to revisit

the strategy and propose course adjustments,
should they be needed. The team has proposed
a results framework for the CPS, which is aligned
with the EDPRS2 and has the support of IFC and
MIGA. A summary is included in Table 4 and an
elaborated version is available in Annex 1.

125

Analytical work will, for the large part,
be used to inform and support the
lending program. Nevertheless the WBG will
continue to undertake AAA and knowledge
work in other excluded areas outside the core
six areas of operation where our engagement
is considered to have spillover effects on our
current focus areas. As examples, this might
include mining, regional integration, ICT and skill
development. An indicative program for AAA
and knowledge work is presented in Table 5.

has likewise supported Government-led impact
evaluation work.

VII. Managing risks

127

The main internal risks to growth
and poverty reduction arise from
variable climatic conditions and the private
sector response to government reforms.
Agriculture is the main employer and driver of
poverty reduction but remains vulnerable to the
vicissitudes of unpredictable weather patterns
and regional droughts and floods, which can
significantly affect output and progress on
poverty reduction. Stepping up measures to
make agriculture more climate-resilient, for
instance through the construction of irrigation
facilities and terracing, will be important for
attaining EDPRS 2 targets. More broadly the
hope for even more rapid GDP growth rests on
the private sector (including external investors)
stepping up to the plate, and in recent years the
response has been a touch muted.

128

The main external risks relate to the
pace of regional integration and the

Accelerating Economic Growth

potential for regional conflict, more-rapidthan-expected tapering of donor inflows, and
a prolonged slump in the global economy.
As a landlocked country, Rwanda is critically
dependent on closer integration with its
neighbors to facilitate imports and exports and
drive economic growth. While strong progress
on regional integration could drive economic
growth across the region and boost regional
stability, renewed tensions and conflict could
stall integration—adversely affecting Rwanda’s
plans to become a regional hub—as well as
donor flows with adverse implications for growth.
Rwanda’s high reliance on foreign aid makes its
development strategy vulnerable to reductions
in aid flows. While Rwanda is fairly insulated from
the global economy a prolonged slump would
nevertheless have a negative impact on growth
prospects through lower demand for goods and
services, as well as through more constrained
availability of external financing.

45

We have everything to gain by opening up to new ideas. In our
quest to empower our people and enable them to fulfill their
potential, we simply need to keep adapting. And, as it is often
necessary, we need to do things differently”

VIII. Conclusions

129

The resources of the World Bank Group
are modest relative to the ambitions
and challenges implied in the strategic plans
of the Government of Rwanda. Using these
resources to maximum impact demands
selectivity and high levels of collaboration
between the sister organizations. If WBG is going
to maximize efficiency in delivery, resources will
have to be delivered through a mix of instruments
that balance the need for Government flexibility
in the use of financing against the concerns of
certain shareholders who believe that tracking
of funds is useful.

46

130

The proposed WBG strategy to engage
in energy, urban, agriculture, financial
sector, social protection, and accountable
governance optimizes the resources of all WBG
elements. With the possible exception of the
accountable governance work, both IFC and IDA
resources will be used in all of these areas, and
considerable overlap with MIGA’s own priorities.
The process of preparing this CPS has clarified
multiple areas for close collaboration and
presents a coherent “One Bank Group” approach
to supporting Rwanda’s development over the
next five years.
