FOR
THE FEDERALDEMOCRATICREPUBLICOF ETHIOPIA

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This document sets out an Interim SupportStrategyfor Bank assistanceto Ethiopia
to address the country's immediate post-war recovery needs during the coming 12-24
months. The combined consequencesof severedrought and the two-yearwar with Eritrea
include a large internally displaced population, the destruction of private and public
infrastructure,and inadequateagriculturalproduction in many of the food-deficit areas of
the country. In pursuit of Ethiopia's social and economic rehabilitation, an emergency
assistance program consisting of four operations and amounting to US$700 million is
proposed,in addition to investmentlending for food security, agricultural inputs and two
LILs amounting to approximatelyUS$200 million. A CAS will be prepared in FY02 to
elaborate the Bank's medium-term assistance strategy. During the coming months,
Governmentwill also prepare a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlining its
long-termdevelopmentstrategy,which will serve to underpinthe CAS.
2.
The Board has been informally briefed several times on the Eritrea-Ethiopia
conflict. An additionalinformalbriefing will be held on November i3, 2000. At the July
18, 2000 briefing, the Board was informed that Eritrea and Ethiopia had signed a
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in June 2000, an important step towards ending the
conflictwhich eruptedin May 1998. It is encouragingto note that the agreementsigned in
June 2000 is holding, and that the leaders of both Eritrea and Ethiopia reaffirmed their
commitment to finding a lasting solution to the conflict at the recent UN-sponsored
MillenniumSummit in New York. At the July 18 briefing, it was agreed that the Bank
would prepare an Interim Support Strategy for Ethiopia to accompany the Emergency
RecoveryCredit to the Board. A strong effort by the internationalcommunitywill support
and reinforcethe peace process, particularlywith the resumptionof peace talks at the end
of October2000. The UN peacekeepingforce has begun to be deployed.

2.

POLITICALAND ECONOMICBACKGROUND

3.
Sincethe signing of the Cessationof Hostilities Agreement on June 18, 2000, the
two armies have refrained from significant military action. The agreement calls for the
withdrawalof the Ethiopianarmy from Eritreanterritory and the deployment of a United
Nations peacekeepingforce along a 25 kilometerbuffer zone inside Eritrea until the UN

demarcatesthe border. On July 31, 2000 the United Nations Security Council authorized
the establishmentof a UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UTNMEE).Since August,the
UN has deployed liaison officers in each capital city and UN military observers in the
field. On September 15, 2000, the UN SecurityCouncil authorizedthe deploymentof a
peacekeeping force of up to 4,200 personnel,which should be fully deployed by midDecember, 2000. Both countries are currently discussing the components of a formal
Peace Treaty, under the mediationof the OAU.
4.
Ethiopia's population of 62.8 million is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa,
and its per capita income of US$100, the second lowest. Social indicators are among the
lowest in the world, with a gross primary enrollment ratio of 43 percent and life
expectancy of 43 years. Forty-five percent of the population live below the national
poverty line. After registering encouraging progress throughout the mid-1990s, the
Ethiopian economy has experiencedsignificantsetbacks in the past two years, as a result
of the cumulative impacts of the war and a severe, multi-year drought which reached
major emergency proportions in 2000. These shocks were compounded in 2000 by a
significantreversal in Ethiopia's terms of trade. Underlyingthese immediate difficulties
are the persistent challenges associated with transforming the economy of one of the
world's poorest agricultural economies, and the added burden of an AIDS epidemic that
has already caused widespread suffering and threatens the integrity of Ethiopia's
economicand social fabric.
5.
The current regime overthrewthe communistDerg government in 1991, inheriting
a country impoverished by years of civil war and misguided policies, with per capita
income lower than in 1960. The new Government adopted an economic model which
gives prominenceto the private sector while providingfor continued state involvementin
the provision of public goods and selective interventions to counteract market
imperfectionsin an economy in transition. A central element of the Government's policy
is a direct attack on rural poverty, articulated in its Agricultural Development Led
Industrialization (ADLI) strategy. ADLI emphasizes agriculture and the
complementaritiesbetween agricultural and industrial development as the key to rapid
growth. By the same token, investment directed towards peasant agriculture and rural
service delivery in areas where the bulk of Ethiopia's absolute poor reside is by definition
pro-poor.
6.
Ethiopia's recovery in the 1990s was fuelled by several key changes. Paramount
among these was peace and stability. Second was a radical improvement in
macroeconomicmanagement. The fiscal deficit declined from 8.5 percent of GDP in
FY91 to 4.3 percent by FY98, spurred by a massive demobilizationand drop in military
expenditurefrom over a quarterof GDP in the late 1980sto some 2 percent by FY97, with
much of this peace dividend divertedto the social sectors and other high priority, pro-poor
expenditures. Third, the Government enacted a major grain and agricultural inputs
marketing liberalization. Fourth, the country was blessed by good weather; and finally,
donor funding increased dramatically,with disbursementsfrom loans and grants achieving
levels of 6 percent of GDP by FY98. As a result of these factors, Ethiopia achieved GDP
growth rates averaging some 6 percent per annumduring FY92-99.

2

7.
These impressive economic trends began to deteriorate by the end of FY99,
because of the war as well as the compoundingeffects of drought and a reversal in
Ethiopia's terms of trade. For much of FY99, Governmentefforts to protect development
expenditures used a combination of cuts in non-essential, non-military expenditures,
higher deficits and the utilization of privatizationproceeds and public enterprise earnings,
and achieved some success; GDP grew by 6.2 percent in FY99, inflation remained
subduedand social sector spendingas a ratio of GDP declinedonly marginally.By FY00,
however,the Government'sfocus on the developmentagenda had been overwhelmedby a
combinationof defense expenditures exceeding 13 percent of GDP, drought manifesting
as incipient famine, a sharp deteriorationin the terms of trade1 , and a decline in non-food
donor disbursements. Preoccupation with the conflict also meant a diversion of
Government attention, with the result that reforms (particularly those associated with
deregulationand liberalization) either slowed or were delayed. The fiscal deficit rose to
nearly 11.6percent while internationalreserves fell to 2 months of import cover by FY00.
As a result, federal development transfers to the regions fell by 24 percent in FY00,
investor confidence fell, and the private sector faced significant shortages of foreign
2 . Inflation has remained low, largely because grain prices were suppressed by
exchange
large food aid imports (more than 800,000 tons of which were deliveredand distributed),
but also because several years of prudent macroeconomicmanagement had left room for
expansionarypolicies. Notwithstanding the drought, GDP still grew by 4.6 percent in
FY00, ironicallyas a result of militaryoutlays as well as from agriculturalgrowth in areas
not affectedby the drought. A final element in the tapestry of these two troubled years is
an awakening consciousnessof a more fundamentalrisk to the country - AIDS. Over 9
percent of the adult population are now living with HIV/AIDS; with 3.2 million infected,
Ethiopiahas more HIV/AIDS
casesthan any countryin the world except South Africaand
India. There are thought to be more AIDS orphans (650,000) in Ethiopia than anywhere
else -- and the epidemic is by no means yet mature.

8.
A notable but often overlookedaspect of the war years is a famine that could have
resulted in a tragedy comparable to 1984-85, but was identified early and essentially
averted. The relief effort was well managedby the Governmentand the donor community
(in particularby the UN system, the US, the EU and various international and national
NGOs). Severe drought has plagued parts of Ethiopia for the last several years, with
successivefailures of rains causing significantmalnutrition,large livestock losses, a high
incidence of disease and an increase in the overall vulnerability of certain rural
populations. The worst-affected areas over the period have been the eastern Amhara
highlands (the center of the 1984-85 crisis) and the pastoral areas of the south and
southeast(Ogaden,Borana and areas west of Borana).As many as 10 million people have
been at risk of famine in FY00, and many herds have been decimated. Early in the year,
the UN appealedto the internationalcommunityfor 800,000tons of food. Pledges at first
materialized slowly and took time to arrive, though the Government's local procurement
of 100,000tons of grain, along with catalytic action by USAID, managed to bridge the
i

Coffeevolumesandpricesdeclined,whileoil pricesincreased.

Data drawn from the Ethiopian InvestmentAuthorityindicate that new investmentsfell from a high of 2.9
billionBirr in FY98 (5.5 percent of GDP)to 1. I billion Birr in FY99 (2.1 percent of GDP), and to 0.5 billion
Birr in the first nine months of FYOO(less than 1 percent of GDP).

gap and stave off a fuill-blownfamine. In spite of international assistance, responding to
the drought put severe pressure on the Government's resources, and, as of September
2000, more than 5 million people were still considered at risk. In summary, the economic
history of the war period is one of a struggle against successive shocks, and of lost
opportunities in the fight against poverty - what the Prime Minister has described as
Ethiopia's "real war".

3.

THE GOVERNMENTOF ETHIOPIA'SPOST-WARRECOVERY
PROGRAMAND FINANCINGREQUIREMENTS

9.
The Ethio-Eritrean war has left numerous damaging legacies on both sides of the
border. Tens of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers and civilians have died as a direct
consequenceof the fighting. The Governmentestimates that more than 360,000 civilians
have been displaced from the border areas, losing their homes, businesses and much of
their property in the process. Over 75,000 people are reported to have been deported from
Eritrea. Some US$200 million of public and social infrastructurehas been destroyed and
damaged- including schools, clinics, water supply,roads and power facilities.
10.
In late June, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) approached the Bank to assist
with a Post-War Recovery Program which would address demobilization, emergency
humanitarian needs and reconstruction,as well as stabilizingthe economy and re-starting
the reform agenda.
11.
Demobilization and Reintegration. The Government's immediate emergency
response consists of two elements,and the Bank has been working closely with GOE since
early September on their design. The first of these, the Demobilizationand Reintegration
Program for Ethio-Eritrean War Veterans (EDRP), proposes the demobilization of
approximately 150,000 military personnel in two phases. The first phase consists of the
demobilizationof 17,000 disabled and 42,000 able-bodiedveterans, and provides care to
the severely disabled as well as economicreintegrationpackages (cash, assets, training) to
the able-bodied.Implementationof this is underway and all 59,000 are expected to be off
the military payroll by mid-2001. The second phase would demobilize approximately
90,000 additionalpersonnel, with the timing of this phase dependent upon the progress of
the peace talks. Before being discharged, all veterans will undergo intensive HIV/AIDS
education as well as individual counseling and voluntary testing. The Government has
indicated a wish to use IDA resources to provideagainst both phases of the program.
12.
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. The second emergency component, the
Rehabilitation Programme for Displaced and Deported Households Due to the EthioEritrean War under the Emergency Recovery Program (ERP), proposes resettlement and
reintegration packages for 364,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), 75,000 deportees,
and 56,000 families who lost breadwinners as a result of the war. In addition, the
reconstructionand rehabilitation of social infrastructurein the border areas and of roads
affected by the conflict are included in the package.

4

13.
EconomicStabilizationand the Resumptionof Reform. Followingthe signing
of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the Governmentbegan to take measures to
stabilizethe economyand move back on to a sustainablegrowth path. To guide this effort,
the Governmenthas prepared an Interim Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper (I-PRSP).The
I-PRSP is expectedto form the basis for the preparationof a poverty reduction strategy,
and for support for economicstabilizationand structural reform measures; in addition, a
HIPC Decision Point Document is being prepared with a view to consideration by the
Boards of the Fund and the Bank before the end of 2000.
14.
The critical first steps in stabilizing the economy are to create fiscal space to
finance key emergency programs; to provide foreign exchange for immediate import
needs, in particular those required by the private sector; and to reduce Government
recourse to domestic borrowing. Meeting these objectives requires a sharp reduction in
military expenditures and access to significant amounts of foreign financing. The
Government has committed itself to cutting military expenditure significantly (the
program agreedwith the Fund in early Novemberenvisagesa reduction from 13.3 percent
of GDP in FY00 to 5 percent of GDP by FY03).
15. The structural reforms elaborated in the I-PRSP include the removal of
bureaucraticimpedimentsto private investmentand increased competition in the financial
sector; enhanced competitiveness in agricultural inputs markets; and measures to
streamline the implementation of public sector development programs and projects,
particularlythe Educationand Health SectorDevelopmentPrograms.Also noteworthyis
the Government's recent decision to encourage the return of foreign investment to
Ethiopia by requesting the good offices of MIGA to help settle a number of outstanding
expropriationclaims dating from the Governmentexpropriationsof 1974.
16. Financing Requirements. Preliminary indications from donors suggest that
disbursementsfrom loans are expected to rise from 2.7 percent of GDP in FY00 to 8.4
percent in FY01 and 8.9 percent in FY02. This includes IDA quick-disbursingassistance
amountingto 2.4 percentof GDP in FY01 and 1.5 percent in FY02. In addition,grants are
projected to increase from 2.7 percent of GDP in FY00 to 6 percent in FY01 and 4.6
percent in FY023 . This significantincrease in donor financingwill permit the Government
to implementthe reconstructionand demobilizationprograms described above, as well as
to restore expenditures in the social sectors, infrastructureand agriculture. The overall
fiscal deficit (including grants) is programmedto fall from 11.6 percent of GDP in FY00
to 8.9 percent in FY01 and 9.2 percent in FY02. Domestic financing of the deficit will be
sharply reduced, and foreign exchange reserves will increase from 2 months of import
cover to 4 months by FY03. This in turn will permit the lifting of current restrictionson
access to foreign exchange for importers, and the repeal of the import surcharge -emergencymeasuresundertaken to stem the drain on reserves in the latter months of the
conflict.

3This

assumes that the ERP financinggap of $300 millionwill be filled (para. 32).

THE BANK'S INTERIM SUPPORT STRATEGY

17. The Bank's objective in the immediatepost-warperiod is to help the countrydeal
as quicklyas possible with the human, materialand financial destabilizationcausedby the
war, while simultaneously re-engaging on core development issues. The emergency
componentof the Interim Support Strategywill, at one level, help stabilize the economy
and restart economic growth, while also releasing counterpart funds for the country's
reconstruction and rehabilitation needs. The overall strategy consists of a series of
initiativesdesignedto:
A. Address the immediatehuman,infrastructureand economicemergency,and to
set the economyback on a path of sustainableeconomicgrowth;
B. Tackle weaknesses in the management of the IDA portfolio, which have
accumulatedduring the war and which require urgent attention if an ambitious
programof new interventionsis to succeed,and
C. Engage in longer-termBank assistancein three areas of critical importance to
the Ethiopianeconomy- food insecurity,the spread of HIV/AIDS,and systemic
weaknessesin Ethiopia's capacityto produceand deliver essential services.
A)

The Bank's Responseto the Emergency

18.
Four emergency operations are currently under preparation; these projects would
provideUS$700 million in new IDA credits in the coming monthsto address the impact of
the conflict on individuals directly affected by the conflict (soldiers, internally displaced
civilians, deportees, families which have lost breadwinners); on social and economic
infrastructure destroyed or damaged as a result of the fighting; and in support of an
appropriatemacroeconomicframework and important structural reforms proposed in the
I-PRSP. In addition, funds would be provided to assure the continued availability of
fertilizer,which is critical for sustainingfood production.
19. Restructuringthe Portfolio. In responseto the emergency,the Governmenthas
requested a reallocationof credit funds from the current portfolio. Ethiopia's undisbursed
TDAbalance is currently US$782 million (Annex 3), of which some US$500 million is
committed. GOE has requested the reallocation of US$30 million for the emergency
program. Of this, US$17.5 million would be reallocated from the Ethiopian Social
RehabilitationDevelopment Fund, US$9.8 million from Energy II, and US$2.5 million
from the EthiopianMulti-SectoralHIV/AIDSProgram.
20.

The Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP -- total

project cost $174.1 million, proposed IDA US$170 million). The project will finance
demobilizationand return of the veteransto their communitiesof choice; the provision of
reinsertion payments and economic reintegrationassistance (to include the financing of
seed capital, skills training, employment subsidies and agricultural tools and inputs);
medical rehabilitation and care for disabled veterans; and an intensive HIV/AIDS
education program aimed initially at those about to be demobilized, and including

6

counseling and voluntary testing4 . The fiscal benefits of demobilization are considerable;
it is estimated that the cost of paying and maintainingthe 150,000 soldiers scheduled for
demobilizationunder the project amounts to some US$90 million per annum. The fiscal
savings from the EDRP thus exceed its costs over the project's implementationperiod.
21.
The Emergency Recovery Program (ERP -- total program cost US$555 million,
proposed IDA US$230 million). The project consists of three core initiatives: the demining of the border areas; resettlement packages for internally displaced persons,
deportees and families who have lost breadwinners (these packages would consist of
different menus of seed capital, inputs and skills-training); and the reconstruction of
private housing and public/social infrastructure (roads, bridges, water supply, schools,
clinics, government offices).
22.
The Fertilizer Supplemental Credit (total project cost US$55 million, proposed
IDA US$50 million). Additional fertilizer imports are needed for the 2001 and 2002 crop
seasons. The timely and adequate supply of fertilizer is an essential component of
Ethiopia's emergencyrecovery program in an economy so dependent on crop production.
It will also help prevent famine, in view of the failed "short" rains over the last three
years. The Bank would therefore process a Supplementalto the current National Fertilizer
Project (CR.2740-ET). The Supplemental will provide bridge financing to maintain
fertilizer stocks while several major policy issues are worked through -- in particular, the
sustainability of the fertilizer credit system, which is currently guaranteed by regional
governments, and the contraction in the network of private traders carrying fertilizer
stocks, which has negatively affected farmers' access to stocks and thus their uptake of
fertilizer.
23.
The Emergency Support Credit (ESC -- proposed IDA US$250 million). An
immediate priority is to stabilize the economy and to put Ethiopia back on a sustainable
growth path. A macroeconomic stabilization program has been agreed upon with the
Fund, and would be supportedby an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
in the amount of SDR 87 million (US$111 million) and by this credit, as well as the ERP
and EDRP projects. The operation, yet to be prepared, in addition to helping stabilize the
economy, will allow Government to undertake urgent measures such as lifting current
restrictions on access to foreign exchange for importers, repeal of the import surchargeas
well as other policy measures that will facilitate economic recovery, especially in the
private sector. The EU is also likely to provide balance of payments support, and the
African DevelopmentBank has expressed similar interest. The timing of the ESC would
be relatedto progressin the peace process.

Strengtheningthe IDA Portfolio and ImprovingProject Implementation
Capacity

24.
In October 2000, a Country Portfolio Performance Review was carried out. The
CPPR discussed significant weaknesses in portfolio implementation. The IDA
disbursement ratio fell from 15 percent in FY99 (US$148 million disbursed) to only 11
percent in FY00 (US$105 million disbursed). In addition, the audit compliance ratio fell
from 24 percent in FY99 to 11 percent in FY00. In some cases, moreover, the CPPR
identified insufficientprogress on policy and institutionalobjectives.
25.
While low disbursementsin FY00 relate in some measure to the impact of the war
and to slow international contractor mobilizationon several large infrastructureprojects,
more fundamental issues of public sector capacity are at the root of current poor
performance - as shown by instances of disappointing overall project management, and
weaknesses in procurement and financial management. Following the CPPR, a Portfolio
Improvement Program (PIP) was prepared and agreed with the Minister for Economic
Development and Cooperation. PIP actions include the closing of a poorly-performing
credit, preparationof a Country Financial AccountabilityAssessment,tighter supervision
of infrastructurecontracts, and actions to streamlineplanning and procurement under the
Education and Health Sector Development Programs. Implementation of the PIP will be
monitored by a joint IDA/ Governmentteam, and any impediments or delays resolved by
the Minister's intervention. Early signs are encouraging, with first-quarter disbursements
for FY01 up 33 percent on the same period in FY00. Currently, 74 percent of the required
audit reports are up to date.
C)

The Bank's Re-engagementin Key StructuralAreas

26.
In addition to focussing on immediate emergency needs and on tackling the
institutional underpinnings of IDA portfolio management, the Bank's Interim Support
Strategy in FY01/02 will address three key medium-term issues - food security and
agriculturalinputs, HIV/AIDSand weak institutions/inadequatehuman capacity.
27.
Food Security. This year's famine points once again to a familiar Ethiopian
tragedy - while large parts of the country regularly produce grain surpluses, have
increased their fertilizer consumption five-fold in the past 10 years, and have more than
doubled grain production between the mid-1980s and the peak years in the mid-1990s,
other drought-proneareas struggleto provision themselves, exist largely beyond the reach
of the market and depend increasinglyon food aid for their survival. The Governmenthas
identified 156 perennially food-deficit districts, containing a population of over 21
million. Although a number of viable dry-land agriculturalpackages have been developed
for these areas with the assistance of bilateral donors and NGOs, these have not been
widely disseminated; nor have the public delivery systems and infrastructure support
needed to achieve meaningful agricultural growth and off-farm employment been
developed. The Bank's Food SecurityProject (indicativeIDA contributionUS$80 million;
estimated Board presentation in FY02) would make available to drought-prone
communities menus of promising technical packages, using participatory planning
techniques to ensure relevance and encourage community involvement. The project is
8

envisagedas the first of a series of such operations, to be conducted in close cooperation
with other donors active in the sector.
28.
Agricultural Inputs. The Government has focussed on improving farmer
productivityprincipally through the promotion of modern fertilizers and improved seeds.
IDA has been involved in fertilizer and seed supplythrough two projects which will close
in the next twelve months. In responseto second generationissues that have surfacedin
the past few years, the Government is developing an integrated land husbandry
management programto ensure more sustainableyields and production in the agriculture
sector. This program, for which Government is seeking IDA support (indicative IDA
contribution US$120 million; estimated Board presentation in FY02) would involve
financing incrementalfertilizer imports beyond the 2001 and 2002 crop seasons, support
for improved seed production, and measures to improve competitiveness in input
distribution,credit provision and extensionin the context of a still-dormantprivate sector.
29.

HIV/AIDS. The Ethiopia Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project (EMSAP -- IDA

contributionUS$60 million) was approved by the Board on September 12, 2000. This
project supports Ethiopia's national AIDS strategy by financing the expansion of multisectoral efforts as well as by creating an Emergency HIV/AIDS Fund (HAF). The HAF
will disburse directlyto NGOs active at the nationalor regional level, as well as provide
block grants for HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities to town-level HIV/AIDS
committees.The project would be followedby others as and when initial IDA financing is
exhausted.
30.

Institutions, Capacity and Service Delivery. The Ethiopian government has

asked the Bank to give very high priority to helping Ethiopia build public and private
sector capacity. Accordingly, the Bank has launched a program of studies on various
aspects of the country's institutional and capacity-building agenda, with the twin
objectives of utilizing existing capacity better (through institutional reform) and
developing new skills where there are gaps. Studies underway or planned include a case
study of decentralizationpractices at the district and town levels; a review of service
delivery performance by line agencies; an exercise to convene international investors,
nationalentrepreneursand the Government,in order to identify and remove bottlenecksto
investment in promising sectors; and further support for key aspects of the Civil Service
Reform Program, such as improving incentive structures for civil servants. A Bankadministered/Italian-fundedCapacityBuilding Trust Fund will act as the main vehicle for
financing this work. In time, IDA project financing would be expected to follow this
initialanalyticalwork.
31.
In addition to the operations and analytical work already described, a number of
LILs have been under preparation since the pre-conflict period. The Womens'
Development Initiatives Project (IDA - US$5 million) was approved earlier this fiscal
year, and two more LILs are slated for approval- Distance Learning, and MedicinalPlants
(IDA contributionsin each case US$5 million).During the coming months, MIGA is also
expectedto re-extend insurancecoverage to Ethiopia, while IFC will be actively seeking
new investmentopportunities.

DONOR'S RESPONSE TO THE EMERGENCY

32.
In the past, the Governmenthas used the ConsultativeGroup process as its main
mechanismfor effecting donor coordinationin Ethiopia. Due to the war, however, there
has been no CG Meeting since December 1996. In the interim, donor coordination has
been conductedmainlythrough sector-specificgroups in education,health, roads and food
security. Donors have also coordinated among themselves under the Development
Assistance Group, which is co-chaired by the Bank and UNDP. The donor community
has expressed support for the efforts of the Bank and the Fund to help the Government
launch its Post-War Recovery Program, in particular for the EDRP and the ERP. The
various programs and projects described above have been discussed with donors during
the past four months, with a view to burden sharing and future donor participation.The
Governmentwill shortly hold discussionswith donors to confirm additional support for
the EmergencyRecovery Program, which has an unmet financing gap of over US$300.
Considerableinterest has been shown by key donors (Japan, the US, the EU, Italy, the
Nordic countries, and the UINfamily). The European Union has also indicated interest in
providing balance of payments support and in contributing to the financing of
demobilizationand reconstruction. The IMF Board is scheduled to consider the Poverty
Reductionand GrowthFacility in December.
33.
In support of the Government'srequest in January 2000 for assistance to the
internally displaced, the UN Country Team issued an appeal and relief action plan
proposingUS$27.5 million in food and non-food assistance.Donors had, by June 2000,
pledged US$20 million, mainly in food. An updated appeal was issued in August
requestingadditional funds totalingUS$30 millionfor food and non-food items. WFP has
been providing assistance to over 200,000 people displaced by the conflict since April
1999. So far the United States has been the largest donor of relief food for the internally
displaced, with contributions also coming from the European Union, Ireland, Canada,
Japan, the Netherlandsand Norway. The UN Country Team has also initiated a series of
studies and actions in the Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) sector since June 1999,
providingtechnical support to a landmine and unexploded ordinance awareness project
targetingthe displaced populationsin the Tigray Region.

6.

RISKS AND THEIR MITIGATION

34.
The most obvious risk to a Bank strategy of post-conflict support is that the war
resumes. Generalized instability in the region is also a potential cause for concern. In
view of the signing of the Cessationof Hostilities Agreement and the establishmentof a
substantialUN peacekeeping force, scheduledto be fully deployed by mid-December, a
resumptionof the war seemsunlikely. Theunilateral initiation of demobilizationunder the
EDRP serves as a significant confidence-buildingmeasure, as does the Government's
commitmentto borrowing IDA funds for a second phase of demobilization and for demining. The Bank's program is designed in the context of, and aims to support, an
ongoing step-by-steppeace process, key elementsof which are the deploymentof the UN
peacekeepingtroops along the border, the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Eritrean
10

territory, and continuedprogress in the currentpeace negotiations.Shouldwar resume,the
Bank would exercise its remedies, as provided for in the legal agreements for the
EmergencyCredits.
35.
The Government has agreed with the IMF on a macroeconomic framework
embodyinga phased reduction in militaryexpendituresfrom 13.3 percent of GDP in FY00
to approximately 5 percent of GDP by FY03. Non-developmental as well as social
expenditures will continue to be monitored under the annual multi-donor Public
ExpenditureReview. Additional monitoringwill take place under the PRGF, I-PRSP and
HIPC processes.
36.
Another risk is the lack of absorptivecapacity in the public sector, as evidencedby
serious weaknessesin project implementationcapacity.The package of IDA post-conflict
assistancehas been designedwith close attentionto this issue. Some of the componentsof
this overall package (the Emergency Support Credit, the Fertilizer SupplementalCredit)
will not tax implementationcapacity. Other components(in particular, the infrastructure
sub-componentsof the ERP) will be implementedby agencies with experienceunder IDA
projects. Lessons learned from the previous Bank-coordinatedprogram for Emergency
Recovery and Reconstruction(ERRC) in 1991 have helped to strengthen design in this
area (the ERRC was rated highly satisfactoryby OED). The components of the strategy
which present the greatest challengesare the demobilizationand household rehabilitation
sub-componentsof EDRP and ERP, which involve the administration of many small
payments and verification of their use for specified purposes. The Govemment has,
however, indicated that regular cabinet-level attention will be given to these subcomponents. In addition, the Bank's assessment of capacity in the Tigrayan regional
administration,which will be primarilyresponsiblefor implementation,is favorable.Clear
monitoringprocesses have also been established,and are linked explicitlyto the release of
funds under the two projects.
37.
In addition, if the expected support from other donors does not materialize in a
timelyfashion, progresson the componentsof the ERP not funded by IDA will be slowed.
This will not, however, affect the implementationof the IDA program, though a lack of
substantialdonor involvementin the ERP wouldbe seen by some as increasing the risk of
a resumptionof conflict.

7.

TRANSITIONTOWARDSA CAS

38.
A full CAS for Ethiopiawill be prepared in the course of FY02. By then, post-war
economic recovery should be well underway; the CAS would therefore focus on
Ethiopia's medium-termdevelopmentagenda,and the Bank's response to this. The CAS
will be greatly influenced by the preparation of a full PRSP, which will begin early in
calendar year 2001, as well as by the HIPC process and the consequent availability of
additional resources for financing poverty alleviation and social expenditures. The
Governmenthas indicated that it will seek continued IDA support for major programs of
infrastructuredevelopment,particularlyin the roads and power sectors, as well as for food

11

security and agriculturaldevelopment,and for the effort to build national institutions and
human capacity.
