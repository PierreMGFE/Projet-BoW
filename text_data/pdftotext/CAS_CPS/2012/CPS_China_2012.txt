Executive Summary

China's economic and social development over the past three decades has been remarkable.
GDP growth averaging about 10 percent a year has lifted more than 600 million people out of
poverty. All Millennium Development Goals have been reached or are within reach. With a
population of 1.3 billion, China recently became the second largest economy.
Yet China remains a developing country and its market reforms are incomplete. In 2011,
China's gross national income per capita of $4,930 ranked 114th in the world; and over 170
million people live below the $1.25-a-day international poverty line. China is home to the
second largest number of poor in the world.
As recognized by China's 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP, 2005-20 10), the country's pattern of
growth, which has relied on industry and investment, has led to growing economic,
environmental, and social imbalances. Moreover, the country's traditional sources of growth
are likely to weaken. China's main challenge in the medium term is to navigate the uncertain
global economic environment while putting the economy on a more sustainable growth path.
This involves reinvigorating the underlying drivers of growth, shifting to a more consumerbased economy, addressing pollution and natural resource depletion, and reversing
inequalities of income and opportunity.
China's 12th FYP (2011-2015) forcefully addresses these issues. It highlights the
development of services and measures to address environmental and social imbalances,
setting targets to reduce pollution, to increase energy efficiency, to improve access to
education and healthcare, and to expand social protection. Its annual growth target of 7
percent signals the intention to focus on quality of life, rather than pace of growth.
The World Bank Group's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-FY16 is aligned with
China's 12th FYP. It is also informed by the joint study, China 2030, prepared by the World
Bank and the Development Research Center of the State Council. To support China's goal of
a harmonious society, the Bank Group will focus on three main areas of engagement:
*

Supporting greener growth, by helping China shift to a more
path; enhancing urban environmental services; promoting
transport; promoting sustainable agriculture practices; piloting
resource management approaches; demonstrating pollution
strengthening mechanisms for managing climate change.

*

Promoting more inclusive development, by increasing access to quality health
services and social protection; strengthening skills development programs, including
for migrant workers; enhancing opportunities in rural areas and small towns; and
improving transport connectivity for more balanced regional development.

*

Advancing mutually beneficial relations with the world, by supporting China's
South-South cooperation and China's role as a global stakeholder.

sustainable energy
low-carbon urban
sustainable natural
management; and

The Bank Group's most valuable contribution in China remains its role in bringing and
applying ideas, innovation, and knowledge. The CPS emphasizes knowledge sharing and
1

cooperation through advice and analytical products and through public and private sector
investments at the provincial level that introduce and demonstrate new approaches. Nonlending services are expected to grow in importance over the CPS period, building on China
2030. IBRD lending over the CPS period is expected to remain stable at about US$1.5 billion
for 10-13 projects per year. IFC's investments are expected to remain strong at US$5001,000 million for about 25 projects per year. MIGA retains significant room for further
exposure in China and will use this available space to pursue projects aligned with its global
strategy. The World Bank Group - IBRD, IFC, and MIGA - will continue to collaborate to
maximize their impact.
Risks to the Bank Group's development effectiveness in China are deemed moderate, given
China's good capacity, strong ownership of the Bank Group program, and track record of
high performance.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

1.

Over the past 32 years, China and the World Bank Group have forged a strong two-

way and evolving partnership. In the early years, the World Bank brought international experience
to help design economic reforms, improve project management, and address key bottlenecks to
growth. More recently, the Bank Group has helped address environmental challenges and other
development priorities. The Bank Group strategy will continue to evolve as China faces new
challenges in its transition from middle- to high-income status.

2.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for fiscal years (FYs) 2013-2016 is aligned
with the challenges and priorities outlined in China's 1 2 th Five-Year Plan. The CPS is also
informed by the recent joint study-China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative
Society (China 2030) prepared by the World Bank and the Development Research Center of the
State Council.' Consistent with China's priorities, the CPS focuses on three main themes: green
growth; inclusive development; and mutually beneficial relations with the world. Bank Group
support to China is designed to play a catalytic role through innovation and demonstration. In
addition, the Bank's Group's engagement with China contributes to the Bank's global knowledge
and helps China share its development experiences with the rest of the world.

I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES

A. Economic and Social Developments
Developments over Three Decades
3.

Since initiating market reforms in 1979, China's economic performance has been

remarkable. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged about 10 percent a year; and per
capita gross national income (GNI) reached $4,930 in 2011 (in current dollars), categorizing China as
an upper-middle-income country. 2 Importantly, more than 600 million people were lifted out of
poverty as China's poverty rate fell from 84 percent in 1981 to 13 percent in 2008.3 China's rapid
growth has made it a significant presence on the global stage-it is the world's largest exporter and
the second largest importer and it emerged in 2011 as the world's second largest economy.
4.
Two historic transformations-market reform and urbanization-have driven China's
economic expansion. In a gradual and experimental way, China has shifted from a closed,
centralized, and command-based economy to a more open and market-based one. Rapid
urbanization-the largest peacetime movement of people in history has transformed China from a
rural, agricultural economy into an increasingly urban and economically diversified one. Thirty years
ago, 80 percent of China's population lived in rural areas and agriculture accounted for about onethird of GDP. Today, just over half the population lives in urban areas, while agriculture makes up
around one-tenth of GDP.

GNI was $8,430.
As measured by the percentage of people living on the equivalent of US$1.25 of less per day in 2005 PPP terms.

5.
China's social development has been equally impressive. All Millennium Development
Goals have been reached or are within reach. China has achieved nearly universal coverage and
gender parity in basic education and has rapidly expanded enrollment in senior high school and
tertiary education institutions. In addition, the state enterprise-based "iron rice bowl" social
protection system has been transformed into a market-compatible system with rapidly expanding
coverage. China has rebuilt its health delivery network, sharply reduced the burden of infectious
disease, and expanded coverage of health insurance to almost all rural and urban citizens. From 1998
to 2007, maternal mortality declined from 110 to 38 per 100,000 live births.
6.
Its remarkable economic success notwithstanding, China remains a developing country.
It ranked 114th in the world in 2011 in terms of GNI per capita.4 Over 170 million Chinese continue
to live below the $1.25-a-day per capita international poverty line (in 2005 PPP terms)-the second
largest number of poor in the world after India. Continuing to combat poverty and reducing income
inequality remain important challenges in China (see Box 1).

Box 1: Poverty and Inequality in China
China's remarkable growth has been accompanied by a parallel reduction in poverty and improvement in
human development indicators. More than 600 million people have moved out of poverty over the past 30 years:
the number of people living on the equivalent of US$1.25 or less (in 2005 PPP terms) was reduced from 835 million
in 1981 to 173 million in 2008-still a large number. Many more are "near poor"-just above the poverty line and
vulnerable to shocks that could cause them to fall back into poverty. Extreme poverty, in the sense of not being able
to meet the most elementary food and clothing needs, has been almost eliminated in China.
The Chinese government has accorded high priority to poverty reduction, implementing a series of clearly
articulated rural poverty alleviation strategies. The most recent is the Outline for Development-Oriented Poverty
Reduction for China's Rural Areas (2011-2020). In November 2011, the government adjusted the official rural
poverty line to be more in line with international standards, qualifying 100 million more people for a variety of
benefits that will bring more resources to poor regions.
The characteristics of poverty have changed, making poverty reduction increasingly difficult. The remaining
poor are more dispersed. Poverty is mainly a rural phenomenon and most severe in China's western regions, in
upland villages, among ethnic minorities, and in households with low levels of educational attainment. Relative to
the general population, the elderly and children are more likely to be poor, reflecting the high numbers of children in
poor households. There are growing concerns about social exclusion of migrant workers, who lack an urban resident
status and have limited access to basic social services.
China has high inequality of income, consumption, assets, and opportunity. Disparities have increased between
rural and urban areas and also within rural and urban areas. Although the rise in income inequality may have slowed
or paused, thanks in part to increased transfers of public resources to poor rural areas, other dimensions of
inequality-such as asset ownership, particularly housing-have continued to rise. Inequalities in incomes are
mirrored and exacerbated by large disparities in opportunities to access quality social services and social protection.
Using income and poverty as a lens, China can be viewed as three distinct regions. The first is the eastern
coastal region, home to 45 percent of the population, which has enjoyed rapid growth and poverty reduction owing
to its geographical location and early introduction of reforms. By contrast, the central and western regions, home to
55 percent of the population, have lagged behind. If these two lagging regions formed a separate economy, its GNI
per capita would be about half that of the coastal region.

There is growing recognition of the need to change the country's growth pattern. While
serving China well in many respects, rapid growth and accompanying structural change have
contributed to economic, environmental, and social imbalances. Spurred by high savings, cheap
finance, and export-oriented policies, China's growth has been capital intensive, industry led, energy
and resource intensive, and environmentally damaging. The priority accorded to industry has stunted
services development, while the emphasis on physical capital has constrained investment in the
quality of human capital, increasing inequality. Notwithstanding massive internal migration from
farms to cities, policies such as "hukou" (the household registration system) have constrained the
welfare benefits of labor mobility.5 The share of wages in national income has fallen steadily; the

share of capital has climbed.

1 1 th

Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) and Recent Developments

8.
Recognizing shortcomings in the pattern of growth, the 1 1 th Five-Year Plan (FYP)
emphasized environmental and social objectives. It sought to make domestic demand the main
driver of growth, with services as the leading sector. The 11 th FYP's objective was to better balance
economic growth with greater equality of opportunity and to improve basic services (especially
health, education, and social protection), resource conservation, energy efficiency, and environmental
protection. To meet these objectives, the 11 th FYP set out 15 main tasks and strategic priorities
supported by quantitative indicators (see selected targets and results in Table 1).
Despite the global financial crisis, growth during the 11th FYP period remained strong.
9.
It averaged 11.2 percent, far exceeding the target of 7.5 percent. Macroeconomic management was
broadly effective, keeping inflation at an average of 2.9 percent, the budget (broadly) balanced, and
public debt low. China implemented a large stimulus package in 2009-10 to cushion the effects of the
global economic crisis, expand social infrastructure, and stimulate green investments. Although the
stimulus would later contribute to overheating and heightened macroeconomic risks, including goods
and asset price inflation, indicators suggest that the authorities have so far been successful in
engineering a "soft landing" (see para. 11).
10.
Considerable progress was also made toward improving social protection and education
and health services, particularly in rural areas. The government demonstrated its intent to push
ahead with structural reforms by increasing renmimbi (RMB) exchange rate flexibility, introducing a
fuel tax, collecting dividends from state-owned enterprises, expanding social security coverage, and
increasing public investment in agriculture and rural areas. But the onset of the global financial crisis
and the focus on maintaining rapid growth in the midst of a global slowdown meant that other
reforms were given less priority. As a result, progress in rebalancing the economy was mixed. On the
one hand, the external trade surplus declined and the rise in income inequality appears to have
slowed. On the other, less progress was made in shifting the economic structure away from industry
and toward services, increasing energy efficiency, and improving key environmental indicators.
11.
China's economy has slowed since 2010 due to the phasing out of the 2009-10 stimulus
policies and a weaker global economic environment. Growth slowed from 10.4 percent in 2010 to
9.3 percent in 2011. While consumption has remained strong due to rapidly rising wages and solid
labor market fundamentals, weak external demand and slowing investment have exerted a drag on

growth. The previously booming property sector has also turned, with the majority of China's larger
cities reporting modest price reductions and sharply lower sales volumes.
12.
2012 will likely see a further deceleration in growth to around 7.7 percent. This is in part
because global growth will remain anemic and the real effective exchange rate may continue to
appreciate marginally; both factors will slow export growth and have an impact on investment. Risks
mainly reflect external factors, such as uncertainties in the eurozone, as well as domestic risks
associated with the residential property sector. Fortunately, China enjoys sufficient fiscal space to
permit a vigorous fiscal response should the global economy slow suddenly. This time, more of the
stimulus should be channeled through the fiscal rather than the monetary system and be directed at
furthering structural reforms in support of sustainable and inclusive growth over the medium term.

B. China's Medium-Term Challenges and Strategy
Challenges
13.
The Chinese economy faces constraints to sustained growth. First, China must navigate
the next five years, which will be risky as the global economy enters a new and volatile phase and
works its way through the after-effects of the global financial crisis. The policy challenge is to ensure
that the economy slows in a gradual fashion. In the longer term, China's traditional sources of growth
are likely to weaken. Most of the growth contribution from shifting resources from agriculture to
industry has already occurred. Also, going forward, the continued accumulation of capital will
inevitably contribute less to growth as the capital-labor ratio rises. Moreover, the labor force itself is
expected to decline. The population will age rapidly and the dependency ratio will rise, reducing
household savings. Aging will have profound economic and social implications that will affect
growth and the pattern of domestic consumption. Finally, total factor productivity growth a
measure of improvements in economic efficiency and technological progress has also declined over
time, in part because the economy has exhausted the immediate gains from first-generation policy
reforms and from absorbing imported technologies that were relatively easy to access and use.
14.
Given the anticipated structural slowdown, China needs to reinvigorate the underlying
drivers of growth to sustain growth over the medium term. China's private sector is playing an
increasingly important role in the economy-in 2010, private enterprises contributed an estimated 73
percent of gross industrial output and employed about 81 percent of the industrial labor force.6
However, state-owned enterprises still dominate key sectors of the economy. Breaking up
monopolies and pursuing policies that support competition and business development will be needed
to build a more vibrant private sector capable of sustaining broad and inclusive growth. China will
also need a flexible and dynamic labor market, a sound and more commercially oriented financial
system, and land policies to support more efficient land use. Continuing and deepening China's fiscal
reforms will be important for establishing a fiscal system capable of delivering increasing public
goods and services, including meeting new environmental and social challenges.
15.
Addressing the country's environmental deficit is an ongoing challenge. China is now the
world's largest energy consumer and green house gas emitter. Rapid growth has also led to natural
resource depletion and environmental pollution, the costs of which have approached 10 percent of
GDP.7 Air pollution has had severe public health impacts, especially given the growing numbers of
urban residents. More than half of China's water is polluted, over 300 million people use
contaminated water supplies, a third of China's waterways are below the government's own safety
standards, and about a fifth of China's farmland has been contaminated with heavy metals. 8 China's
future development and food security depends on reducing the environmental impact of its economy,
improving the sustainability of its land and water use, and reducing its future impact on the global
environment. The challenge going forward will be to convert these pressures into new sources of
growth by adopting a green growth model that taps into new global markets in green technologies
while it solves many of China's pressing environmental concerns.
16.
The risk of lower growth rates is exacerbated by China's high inequality in income,
consumption, and access to high-quality public services. Notwithstanding massive internal
migration from farms to cities, barriers to labor mobility-the household registration (or "hukou")

system, the lack of portability of pension plans, weak labor market institutions, and inadequate job
market information have trapped tens of millions of farm families in low-paying, low-productivity
work. This, combined with factor and resource price policies that favored enterprise profits and
implicitly taxed household incomes, meant that the share of wages in national income fell steadily in
the first decade of this century and the share of capital climbed. Furthermore, the emphasis on
investment concentrated in urban areas has its counterpart in a lower share of investment in rural
areas-especially in health and education. The "opportunity gap" between urban and rural areas has
grown. Social tensions have ratcheted up, resulting in a growing number of public protests.
Unresolved, this could pose a threat to growth and stability in coming decades.
17.
Strengthening economic and environmental governance and rule of law is a crosscutting challenge. According to surveys in China, the public's trust in public services and the
judicial system is low, creating the potential for social frustration and underscoring the importance of
building an impartial and effective legal and justice system and improving equality of opportunity
and accessibility to high-quality social services. An essential element of reforms in these areas will
be greater consultation and participation of the public in decision making and oversight of service
delivery (including by the justice system), increased transparency in the operations of these branches
of government, and greater accountability to stakeholders and citizens.
China's

1 2 th

Five-Year Plan

18.
China's 1 2 th FYP (2011-2015) seeks to address the medium-term challenges outlined
above by continuing the thrust pioneered in the 1 1 th FYP. It highlights the development of
services and measures to address social, environmental, and external imbalances. It focuses on
improving the quality of life, rather than just the pace of growth, pays attention to balanced
development, and gives greater prominence to urbanization in inland regions and smaller cities. Its
growth target of 7 percent is set low on purpose to signal that the objective is the quality of growth
not growth alone. (Selected 12 th FYP targets are shown in Table 1.)
19.
The 1 2 th FYP stresses improvements in economic efficiency to underpin growth
sustainability. It calls for moving up the value chain in manufacturing while enhancing innovation
and promoting the development of seven new strategic industries, three of which are related to the
environment and energy efficiency-"energy efficiency and environment," ''new energy," and "new
energy vehicles." It sets a target for research and development spending to reach 2.2 percent of GDP;
emphasizes strengthening the creation, use, protection, and management of intellectual property
rights; focuses on updating research funding and venture capital; and pushes for greater
commercialization of research undertaken at government-sponsored universities and research
institutions. The 12 th FYP also stresses the need for higher education reform in science and
technology, and aims to increase the high school enrollment rate to 87 percent by 2015.
20.
Like its predecessor, the 1 2 th FYP emphasizes energy conservation and environmental
protection. It calls for non-fossil fuels to reach 11.4 percent of primary energy consumption (up
from 8.3 percent), energy use per unit of GDP to decline by 16 percent, carbon dioxide emissions per
unit of GDP to fall by 17 percent, major pollutants to decrease by between 8 and 10 percent, and
forest cover to rise to 21.66 percent, in line with China's Copenhagen commitment on forests. The
1 2 th FYP emphasizes climate change and details China's commitment to international cooperation
and the UN-led climate negotiation process.
21.
The 1 2 th FYP also urges inclusive and equitable development as core elements for
promoting a "harmonious society." To make sure all people benefit from development, the
government aims to improve access to high-quality public goods and services and expand the social
6

protection network to cover all people, urban and rural. The population covered by pension schemes
is targeted to increase by 100 million, the coverage rate of health care insurance is to be increased by
3 percentage points from an already very high level, and the level of financial protection from health
shocks is expected to be raised. These advances will be important as societal aging gathers pace
during the FYP period. The government has set a target to provide 36 million urban public
apartments by 2015. Some 45 million urban jobs are expected to be created, and the urban
unemployment rate is expected to remain below 5 percent. The 12 th FYP also anticipates that the
disposable income of households will grow faster than GDP, thus raising the share of labor income in
GDP after a period of decline and stagnation in the 2000s.
22.
The 1 2 th FYP's focus on inclusive development emphasizes the protection of women's
legal rights and the importance of ensuring women's access to basic services. It further highlights
the need to improve women's ability to contribute to economic development by promoting female
employment and entrepreneurship. (See Annex 2 for additional information on gender and
development in China.)
23.
The government also plans to deepen administrative reform and strengthen efforts to
combat corruption. To improve provision of basic public services, the 1 2 th FYP seeks to strengthen
accountability and public financial management and better define central and local government roles
and responsibilities. In addition to administrative reforms, the government aims to increase the
effectiveness of anti-corruption systems, including by improving transparency, reporting, and
enforcement.
China 2030
24.
Building on the 1 2th FYP, a recent report written jointly by the World Bank and
China's Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC) charts possible directions
for China's reforms to 2030. The report, China 2030, notes that China's successful development
strategy over the past three decades has made it an upper-middle-income economy today. But it
points out that the opportunities and challenges in the next two decades will be unlike those
encountered in the past. As a result, the growth model that helped it succeed in the past is unlikely to
work as successfully in the future.
25.
The joint team focused on how China could become a modern, harmonious, and
creative society. Anticipating global megatrends and examining China's opportunities, challenges,
and capabilities over the coming 20 years, the team proposed six strategic directions (see Box 2). At
its core, China 2030 proposes changing the role of government and its relationship to markets, the
private sector, and society at large. More importantly, it focuses on the "how," not just the "what,"
and provides a broader context within which to set the Bank's program in China.

7

Box 2: China 2030
In September 2010, China and the World Bank Group celebrated 30 years of close collaboration. Over the course
of those 30 years, China transitioned from a low-income country to an upper-middle-income country. To
commemorate this partnership, Chinese leaders endorsed a World Bank proposal to work jointly to identify and
analyze the challenges facing China as it moves from middle- to high-income status over the next 20 years.
The report identifies six strategic directions:
(i) Strengthen the foundations for a market-based economy-by redefining the role of government,
developing the private sector, promoting competition in output markets, and deepening reforms in the land,
labor, and financial markets. While providing relatively fewer "tangible" public goods and services directly,
the government will need to provide more "intangible" public goods and services like systems, rules, and
policies that increase production efficiency, promote competition, facilitate specialization, enhance the
efficiency of resource allocation, protect the environment, and reduce risks and uncertainties.
(ii) Accelerate the pace of innovation-by creating an open innovation system in which competitive pressures
encourage Chinese firms to engage in product and process innovation not only through their own research and
development (R&D) but also by participating in global research and development networks. Although China's
R&D investment as a share of GDP is high by international standards for a country at its per capita income
level, much needs to be done to ensure that this investment yields commercially viable innovations that will
help Chinese firms move up the value chain and compete effectively in the same product space as advanced
economies. The emphasis will need to be on: increasing the technical and cognitive skills of university
graduates and building a few world-class research universities with strong links to industry; fostering
"innovative cities" that bring together high-quality talent, knowledge networks, dynamic firms, and learning
institutions, and allow them to interact without restriction; and increasing the availability of patient risk capital
for private start-up firms.
(iii) "Go green"-greener development and increasing efficiency of resource use will not only improve the level of
well-being, it could potentially drive rapid, sustained growth as well. China does not want to replicate the
experience of advanced countries that became rich first and cleaned up later. Instead, China intends to grow
green by following a pattern of economic growth that boosts environmental protection and technological
progress, a strategy that could become an example to other developing countries and perhaps even advanced
economies. Achieving this will require a combination of incentives, regulations, standards, public investments
- all of which together will encourage new investments in low-pollution, and energy- and resource-efficient
industries and build international competitiveness in a global sunrise industry.
(iv) Expand opportunities for all-to access decent jobs, finance, social services, and portable social security to
reverse inequality, help households manage employment- and age-related risks, and enhance the household
welfare benefits of labor mobility. To achieve this will require: more and better quality public services to
underserved rural and migrant populations-from early childhood to tertiary education, from primary health
care to health for the aged; improving the efficiency and quality of core health and education services to
strengthen their contribution to economic transformation, ensure their sustainability, and enhance equality of
opportunity; restructuring the social security system to improve portability of social security instruments; and
participation by all segments of society-public and private, government and non-government, households and
enterprises-to share responsibilities in financing, delivering, and monitoring social services. Reforms in social
services and social security will need to be facilitated by phased reforms of the hukou system to reduce
disparities in social entitlements for migrants.
(v) Strengthen the fiscal system-by increasing the efficiency of the tax structure, improving government
financial management, and ensuring that local governments have adequate financing to meet heavy and rising
expenditure responsibilities. A key element of future fiscal strategy will be to keep the expenditure envelope
under control while reorienting expenditure composition toward new social and environmental challenges.
(vi) Seek mutually beneficial relations with the world-by becoming a proactive stakeholder in the global
economy, actively using multilateral frameworks, and shaping the global governance agenda of international
trade, global financial stability, climate change, food security, and the international aid architecture, among
others.

II. THE WORLD BANK GROUP TRACK RECORD

AND LESSONS LEARNED

26.
The 2006 CPS, coterminous with the 1 1 th FYP, aimed to support China's efforts to shift
its growth pattern. It emphasized the World Bank Group's role as a knowledge institution-many
Bank Group-financed projects introduced innovations or piloted new approaches, and the Bank
Group facilitated China's South-South cooperation (see Box 3: Highlights of World Bank Group
Assistance to China).
27.
The CPS Completion Report rated World Bank Group program performance as
satisfactory. The 2006 CPS organized World Bank Group (WBG) assistance around five thematic
pillars: (i) Integrating China into the world economy; (ii) Reducing poverty, inequality, and social
exclusion; (iii) Managing resource scarcity and environmental challenges; (iv) Financing sustained
and efficient growth; and (v) Improving public and market institutions. Out of 35 outcomes in the
2006 CPS results framework, 33 were partially or fully achieved. (See Annex 3 for the full CPS
Completion Report.)
28.
Portfolio performance is among the best of large IBRD borrowers. China is among the
top three countries in terms of number of active IBRD projects and net IBRD commitments: as of
September 2012, there were 74 IBRD-financed operations with a net commitment amount of US$10
billion. IBRD investment from FY07 to FY12 amounted to US$9.9 billion for 75 investment
operations, averaging about $1.65 billion per year; and about 96 percent of FY07-FY12 projects were
rated satisfactory or above. (See Annex 5 for selected indicators of portfolio performance.) In
addition to delivering results at the provincial and local levels, many IBRD-financed projects have
demonstrated approaches that can be scaled up elsewhere. According to a recent client survey,
piloting innovations is viewed as one of the Bank's greatest values to China (see Box 4).
29.
Trust fund resources have played an important role in leveraging IBRD impact,
especially for environmental objectives. As of the end of FY12, the trust fund portfolio comprised
94 grants with total commitments of US$1.8 billion. Carbon finance operations accounted for more
than 64 percent of commitments, and a large ozone depleting substance project (under the Montreal
Protocol) and 18 GEF-financed projects accounted for another 33 percent of commitments.
30.
The Bank's analytical and advisory activities (AAA) have responded to client needs,
underpinned investments, and set the course for the Bank's future engagement. Provincial-level
AAA, such as on rural-urban integration in Chongqing and Guangdong, generated high interest at
both provincial and national levels and influenced the lending pipeline. Policy dialogue and
analytical work at the national level influenced renewable energy policy, national recycling
legislation, and strategies for education, health, water resource management, and adapting agriculture
to climate change. The Bank supported China's South-South cooperation, especially with Africa,
through workshops and training. The Bank helped evaluate progress under the 1 1th FYP and provided
inputs to the 12 th FYP; and the Bank's Economic Updates have international readership. China 2030,
undertaken from 2010 to 2012, lays the framework for analytical engagement over the coming years.
31.
The IFC focused on climate change, balanced and inclusive rural-urban growth, and
sustainable South-South development. IFC's work on climate change aimed to demonstrate
market-based approaches to reduce the economy's energy intensity and increase efficient use of
water resources. To help balance rural-urban growth and reduce the gap between urban and
frontier/rural areas, IFC undertook investments and advisory work in micro, small, and medium
enterprise (MSME) finance, agribusiness, infrastructure, and food safety. IFC's support for SouthSouth cooperation included helping Chinese companies contribute sustainably to global economic
development, particularly in Africa, through enhancing the social, environmental and economic
9

impact of Chinese engagement and helping to mobilize Chinese resources. In the last six years, from
FY07 through FY12, IFC's investment commitments in China totaled US$3.6 billion (including over
US$850 in mobilization) in 116 projects. In FY12 alone, IFC committed 19 projects worth US$637
million, of which US$577 million for IFC's own account. Around two-thirds of FY12 investments
were in frontier regions of China, while almost half were supporting MSMEs and over one-third had
a positive impact on climate change. As of June 30, 2012, IFC's committed exposure in China had
reached US$2.4 billion, comprising over 100 client companies, with outstanding exposure at US$1.8
billion.
Box 3: Highlights of World Bank Group Assistance to China, 2005-2012
Piloting policies that address the causes of inequality: Analytical work and innovative pilots at the provincial
level have helped improve access to high-quality and affordable healthcare, and have also supported the roll-out and
integration of two new national health insurance programs. Analytical work and policy dialogue have informed
medium- and long-term strategies for educational reform, and projects have improved the quality of education in
western China and the quality of technical and vocational training, including for migrant workers.
Strengthening safety nets and social security: The Bank has continued its support for China's ongoing pension
reforms through a major report on the long-run pension system and complementary AAA on rural elderly welfare.
Engagement on the national dibao (minimum living allowance) social assistance system has also supported China's
efforts to support its most vulnerable citizens. AAA on labor markets and migration has increased the understanding
of labor market dynamics and informed policies to enhance the efficiency and equity of labor policies.
Catalyzing an integrated approach to water and environmental management. IBRD/GEF-financed investment
operations helped demonstrate integrated water and environmental management approaches that are being scaled up

within China and incorporated into national policy. These approaches are of global significance and have attracted
the attention of other water-scarce countries, creating opportunities for South-South learning. JFC has committed
several water sector projects, and MIGA has supported innovative public-private partnership arrangements for urban
water, wastewater, and solid waste management.
Increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy: The Bank financed China's first three energy service
companies (ESCOs), which help industries reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. China now has one
of the largest ESCO markets in the world. JFC's China Utility-Based Energy Efficiency Finance Program facilitated
$1.4 billion in loans, eliminating 17.8 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually. GEF-supported projects
have also demonstrated model urban heat supply systems and consumption-based billing policies and piloted green

building developments. The China Renewable Energy Scale up Program Phase I financed studies whose
recommendations were adopted into policy and law, enabling China's impressive scale-up of renewable energy.
Supporting China's international environmental commitments: The Bank has helped advance China's global
environmental agenda, including phasing out persistent organic pollutants. Bank analytic work has helped underpin
China's greenhouse gas mitigation efforts and 1 2 th FYP climate change objectives. The Bank helped establish the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in China and has been an important intermediary as the market has grown;
IFC is exploring a co-investment partnership with the CDM.
Deepening financial markets: Bank Group support has helped introduce commercially sustainable micro and small
business financing, promoted further rural financial reforms through policy dialogue and TA, and assisted in the
continued strengthening of financial infrastructure (e.g., credit information and reporting). JFC helped introduce a
nation-wide credit reporting system. JFC's Secured Transactions Reform Program in China has helped farmers and
small businesses access more than US$3 trillion in financing by supporting the use of movable assets as collateral.
IBRD and JFC have also played a catalytic role in opening up the capital market and promoting local currency
financing through issuing Panda Bonds and Dim Sum Bonds.
Facilitating South-South knowledge exchange: The Bank Group organized events to share China's development
experience with other countries, especially in Africa, on a range of topics-special economic zones, agriculture and
poverty reduction, health, vocational training, watershed and land management, carbon finance, and transportation.
Responding to an emergency: Both IBRD and JFC responded quickly following the devastating May 2008 8.0
magnitude earthquake in Sichuan province, which left about 100,000 people dead or missing and over 10 million
people homeless.
10

32.
MIGA guarantees and technical assistance focused on infrastructure, national and
regional investment promotion, and South-South investment. MIGA supported foreign direct
investment (FDI) into China principally in the urban water, wastewater, and solid waste treatment
sector, including projects in the western part of China. Its current portfolio consists of five projects
totaling US$96 million in guarantee coverage. Given the improving investment climate, MIGA has
had three recent contract cancellations. MIGA has undertaken joint initiatives with IFC Advisory
Services to help the Ministry of Commerce and Sichuan province through its investment promotion
programs and benchmarking studies. MIGA has been active in cooperating with its partners and with
Chinese banks and companies to support Chinese outward investment.
Lessons Learned
33.
The FY13-16 CPS takes into consideration lessons identified in the CPS Completion Report
and during CPS consultations (see Annex 4). Key lessons include:
(i) Focusing on innovation and pilots at provincial and subprovincial levels is a good way
to leverage World Bank financing given China's development model. Since the 1980s,
China had deployed a pragmatic, learning-by-doing approach to development-reforms are
tested at the village or provincial level and then scaled up. Provincial authorities are
encouraged to experiment.
Box 4: FY 2012 China Country Survey
From December 2011 through March 2012, about 500 stakeholders of the World Bank Group throughout China
were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank Group's support to the country. About 200 stakeholders (40
percent) responded to the survey, which is about the same response rate as the previous country survey in FY
2006. The largest number of respondents came from local government and local project management offices (36
percent), followed by ministries (19 percent). Other respondents included academia and representatives of media,
NGOs, and financial institutions.
Survey Results

* Priorities for Bank Resources. Respondents across most stakeholder groups and geographic locations
indicated that the Bank should focus most of its resources on environmental improvement and poverty
reduction. Approximately a third of respondents reported that it would be most valuable for the Bank to focus
its research and knowledge on environmental and natural resource management issues, with 20 percent
identifying social protection.
* Perceived Value of the Bank's Work. Respondents indicated that the Bank's greatest value to China was in
bringing new concepts and innovation, transferring international best practices, and piloting innovations to be
scaled up. In contrast, FY 2006 respondents rated financial resources as the most highly valued attribute of the
Bank.
* Effectiveness of the Bank. Views on the Bank's overall effectiveness remain high (7.8 on a 10 point scale with
1 being not very effective and 10 being very effective). Respondents from provinces outside of Beijing gave
higher ratings for the Bank's overall effectiveness in China than respondents from Beijing. Since the FY 2006
survey, ratings have increased in a number of areas, including alignment of the Bank's work with country
priorities, staff accessibility, the way the Bank promotes inclusion with non-governmental groups, capacity
building, and sharing knowledge about international best practices (identified as one of the Bank's greatest
values). More than half of respondents identified slow and complex processes as the Bank's greatest weakness.
* The Future Role of the World Bank in China. Respondents indicated that the Bank should play a significant
role in China's development in the next five years (8.2 on a 10-point scale, with 1 being not a significant role
and 10 being very significant role). When asked how the Bank should make itself of greater value in the future,
nearly 40 percent of respondents said the Bank must improve the quality of its experts as related to China's
specific challenges. About 30 percent of respondents said the Bank must offer innovative knowledge products.
11

(ii) Given the increasing importance of knowledge cooperation, strengthen planning and
coordination of non-lending activities. AAA is too fragmented. Agreement with the
government on a multi-year AAA program that builds on China 2030 could increase
partnership and impact, provided there is flexibility to meet Just-in-time requests.
(iii)Strengthen dissemination. Given the Bank's focus on pilots and demonstrations,
documenting results and disseminating lessons are key to successful replication and scale up.
Most projects include monitoring and evaluation components and impact assessments.
However, there is room for improvement to better disseminate the results and maximize the
policy impact of innovative and demonstration projects and AAA findings. Recent efforts to
strengthen dissemination-such as the use of China's extensive distance learning network
and the development of "knowledge platforms" (see para. 41)-should be continued.
(iv) Continue efforts to improve efficiency and streamline processes. Counterparts continue to
identify cumbersome and lengthy processes as the Bank's main weakness (see Box 4 and
Annex 4). Although project preparation times have decreased, the Bank should continue to
seek ways to further shorten and facilitate project preparation and implementation.
(v) Strengthen efforts to mainstream gender in the lending and analytical work program.
Although the composition of the portfolio, which is dominated by infrastructure projects,
makes gender inclusion more difficult, recent efforts to gender-inform projects should be
sustained and applied more systematically (see Box 5).
(vi) Simplify the results framework and ensure realism. As typical of earlier results-based
country strategies, the 2006 CPS results framework was overly complex and ambitious, with
35 outcomes. Going forward, the new CPS should present a selective results framework
linked more realistically to what the Bank Group can influence.
Box 5: Good Practices for a Gender-Sensitive Portfolio in China
A 2010 review of gender-mainstreaming in the IBRD-financed portfolio found that the level of gender-informed
IBRD-financed projects in China is relatively low, reflecting the dominance of infrastructure in the portfolio.
However, the review identified several good practices that have potential to be scaled up:
* Consult with both men and women during project preparation to strengthen project design and
improve outcomes. Consultations with women during preparation of the Rural Health Project helped ensure

that the project design addressed barriers faced by women in accessing health services. Consultations with
men and women during preparation of several transport projects-the Liaoning Medium Cities Project, the
Hubei Yiba Highway Project, the Taiyun Urban Transport Project, and the Wuhan Urban Transport Projectresulted in an increased focus on public lighting and road safety.
* Undertake social analysis to identify gender imbalances that emerge during implementation. When
social analysis found that women were disproportionately affected by involuntary resettlement during

construction financed by the Hubei Yiba Highway Project, the Ningxia Highway Project, and the Wuhan
Urban Transport Project, new project activities were added targeting employment and livelihood
opportunities for women. Similarly, a new component was added to the Agriculture Technology Transfer
Project when a social assessment revealed a need to better support female farmers.

* Use gender-sensitive beneficiary participation during project implementation to increase benefits for
both men and women. Several rural development projects, including the Poor Rural Communities
Development Project, the Sustainable Development in Poor Rural Areas Project, the Pro-Poor Water Reform
Project, and the Western Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Project, used a
variety of tools to ensure that community planning processes captured both men's and women's priorities,
which often differed. The projects also set targets for women's participation in decision-making bodies, such
as project implementation committees or water user associations.

III.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY

34.
The Bank Group's FY2013-2016 CPS is aligned with the priorities of China's 12th-Five
Year Plan (2011-2015), which emphasizes quality of growth. It is also informed by the findings of
China 2030.
A. Framework for World Bank Group Engagement in China
35.
Knowledge sharing and cooperation are at the core of the Bank Group's strategy. The
Bank will transfer knowledge through investments at the provincial level that introduce new
approaches and through AAA at both provincial and national levels, while exploiting synergies
between investments and AAA. IFC will support advisory services and investments at provincial and
and national levels. Given China's emerging needs as an upper-middle-income country and building
on China 2030, knowledge cooperation between China and the World Bank Group is expected to
strengthen during the CPS period.
36.
CPS areas of engagement align with the main themes of the 1 2 th FYP. To support China's
goal of a harmonious society, the Bank Group will focus its financial resources, complemented by
AAA, on two strategic themes: supporting greener growth and promoting more inclusive
development. The Bank Group will also support the cross-cutting theme: advancing mutually
beneficial relations with the world. In addition, the Bank will provide client-driven knowledge
services that help underpin reforms needed to reenergize the drivers of growth. CPS areas of
engagement are shown in Figure 1.

The Bank Group will have an impact through demonstration projects, stand-alone
knowledge services, and the synergies between them. The Bank Group's program will focus on 11
outcomes, as shown in Figure 1. Given that Bank support is modest in comparison to China's own
resources, the Bank Group's program is designed to have an impact beyond its size by introducing
innovations and demonstrating new approaches that can be scaled up and through policy dialogue
and analytical inputs. The CPS Results Matrix (Annex 1) lays out the logical relationship between
Bank Group interventions (ongoing and planned), outputs, and outcomes, including milestones and
indicators to measure progress.
38.
Government counterparts have stressed the importance of several principles of
engagement:
Emphasize knowledge and innovation through both lending and non-lending activities.
The Bank Group's most valuable contribution in China remains its role in bringing and
applying ideas, innovation, and knowledge. In addition to stand-alone knowledge products,
China continues to value knowledge services embedded in lending, using projects as
platforms for innovation and knowledge sharing (see Box 6). Lending will be complemented
and leveraged with policy dialogue and analytical work. Joint or client-driven AAA will be
undertaken in areas where the Bank does not lend or where lending is limited.
Box 6: How IBRD Lending Works in China: Projects as Platforms for Knowledge Sharing
The Bank's program in China has several special characteristics:
* IBRD lending is demand driven from the provincial level and vetted against national priorities. Each year,
China's Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) solicit
project proposals from China's provinces. MOF and NDRC then vet the proposals, taking into consideration
quality, sectors, location, timing, and especially potential for innovation and demonstration. Each spring, MOF,
NDRC, and the World Bank agree on a three-year rolling lending program. This process results in a stable

lending program aligned with the country's development priorities.
* The Bank works directly with China's subnational governments. With a few exceptions, such as railway
projects, IBRD-financed projects are implemented by provinces and municipalities, which are responsible for
loan repayment. The demand from subnational governments for IBRD lending exceeds the lending envelope.

* The Chinese government values projects for the knowhow they bring. As emphasized during CPS
consultations, Chinese counterparts appreciate the technical innovation and hands-on learning from working
with Bank teams during project design and implementation. Small and medium-sized cities, which do not have
much international exposure, benefit in particular from good project management practices--procurement,
financial management, and social and environmental safeguard standards supported by Bank-financed projects.

* The Bank, in partnership with MOF and NDRC, organizes an annual Innovation Workshop to share
international experiences relevant to China. Government officials from agencies and provinces throughout
China participate in the two-day event, which provides a forum to discuss new ideas that influence the lending
pipeline. The June 2012 Innovation Workshop focused on small towns development and social development.

* In addition, Chinese officials appreciate Bank-financed projects for fostering inter-agency cooperation.
Solving increasingly complex development challenges at the provincial and municipal levels requires
cooperation among multiple agencies that typically work in silos. Bank-financed projects provide a framework
for inter-agency cooperation that would not exist otherwise.
* There is synergy between projects and AAA. In some cases, AAA has led to lending-such as the analytical
work on inequality in Guangdong, which led to the Guangdong Urban-Rural Social Security Integration and
Migrant Training Project (FY13). In other cases, lending has led to AAA; for example, the Bank's engagement
in the railway and urban transport sectors has led to analytical work on railway governance (Transport Paper
Series) and sustainable low-carbon city development. Lending helps establish trust and credibility conducive to
effective AAA.
14

*

Shift investments to interior and western provinces. IBRD, IFC, and MIGA programs will
continue to shift to lagging central and western regions and the northeast, the former
industrial base, a trend that will continue under the FY13-16 CPS. Some projects and AAA
will continue to take place in coastal regions because they are best suited for piloting
particularly innovative or complex reforms and investments.

*

Maintain flexibility given China's quickly evolving needs. The Bank Group's support for
China has evolved extensively over time as China's needs have changed. It will be important
for the Bank Group to remain nimble as China's needs continue to evolve.

Knowledge Services
39.
The Bank Group will continue to provide substantial non-lending support. AAA will
comprise standard due diligence work to inform the Bank's work program, IFC advisory services
(AS), WBI activities, support for South-South knowledge exchange (SSKE), and demand-driven
knowledge services, including just-in-time policy notes.

*

The Bank's standard due diligence will include economic and social monitoring (including
the flagship China Economic Update), biannual updates of the country gender action plan,
and analytical work that generates the sector knowledge required for innovative investment
proj ects.

*

IFC advisory services will focus on access to finance, climate change, and water
management, as well as on promoting better standards and sharing of experiences in SouthSouth cooperation between China and developing countries. In addition, IFC's appraisal of
potential investments will continue to assess the economic, financial, environmental, and
social sustainability of projects and look for opportunities to enhance inclusion and
development impact.

*

WBI activities will complement the two strategic themes of the CPS through capacity
development and learning activities as well as supporting mutual experience and knowledge
sharing between China and the rest of the world. Key thematic areas of focus will include
capacity development around health, climate change, and urban planning and development.

*

Bank support for SSKE is expected to increase. The Bank will leverage its sectoral
knowledge from operations and analytical work to help facilitate SSKE.

*

Demand-driven knowledge services will be carried out with Chinese partners or at their
request. Analytical work will be grouped into broader thematic engagement areas defined
jointly with clients. The Bank and DRC are developing a joint research program, building on
China 2030 and deploying the same model ofjoint collaboration.

Indicative AAA themes are shown in Table 2. (See Annex 5 for a list of recently completed AAA,
ongoing AAA, and AAA planned for FY14.)
40.
Given the increasing importance of knowledge services, the Bank and the government
are establishing a system to better plan and coordinate AAA. The Bank and the government will
agree annually on a multi-year AAA program designed to maximize relevance and impact while
leaving room for flexibility and just-in-time requests. IFC will also hold an annual consultation
process with the government to agree on advisory priorities for China.
15

41.

The Bank will strengthen dissemination of AAA and project findings. A new transport

sector knowledge platform provides a model for disseminating project experiences. In addition, the
Bank and government will work together to develop workshops and brochures on key topics to
enhance dissemination of innovative approaches. The Bank will continue to use China's distance
learning network, with more than 50 sites, to deliver distance learning courses based on AAA.

Financial Resources - Knowledge through Investments
42.
IBRD. Over the CPS period, IBRD lending is expected to remain stable at about US$1.5
billion for 10-13 projects per year.9 A three-year rolling lending pipeline is agreed to and updated
annually between the World Bank, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the National Development
and Reform Commission (NDRC). During the most recent lending program discussion in April 2012,
the World Bank, MOF, and NDRC agreed on a lending pipeline of US$5.495 billion for 44
operations during FY13-15, including stand-by operations (see Annex 5). The lending program will
be adjusted as needed and formally reviewed on an annual basis. In 2014 or earlier if needed, the
Bank will prepare a CPS Progress Report, which will include the agreed-upon lending program for
FY15-16.
43.
IFC and MIGA. IFC's strategic priority areas in China-climate change, balanced and
inclusive rural and urban growth, and sustainable South-South development-are well aligned with
the CPS themes. IFC investments are expected to remain strong at US$500-1,000 million for about
25 projects per year for its own account; and IFC expects to mobilize an additional US$200-300
million per year. An estimated US$100-200 million per year will support South-South development.
MIGA retains significant room for further exposure in China and will use this available space to
pursue projects aligned with its global strategy, including complex infrastructure projects and SouthSouth transactions.
44.
Trust funds and carbon finance. Trust funds and carbon finance remain significant in size
(US$1.8 billion in commitments as of end-June 2012) and integral to the Bank's operations in China,
especially in the environmental sector, although cofinancing trust funds from bilateral donors have
declined over the last five years. More than 90 percent of China's trust fund portfolio comprises the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the Montreal Protocol (MP) (for ozone-depleting substances),
and carbon finance. Although China is developing few new climate finance projects under the Clean
Development Mechanism due to a lack of international buyers, the Bank will continue to support
carbon finance through the development of domestic markets (see Outcome 1.7). During the FY1316 CPS, the Bank will continue to support China under the GEF and MP:

*

Global Environmental Facility. GEF engagement in China covers all thematic areas of
GEF-climate change, biodiversity, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and international
waters. About two-thirds of GEF commitments in China address climate change, reflecting
its importance for China and the world. The Bank helped China secure about $115 million
under GEF-IV (FY07-10), and commitments under GEF-V (FY 1-FY14) are expected to
total about US$125-135 million with an increasing share going to climate change and POPs
projects. GEF will also continue to support IFC's China Utility-Based Energy Efficiency
Finance Program. (See Annex 5 for ongoing and pipeline GEF projects.)

*

Montreal Protocol program. China has by far the largest MP program in the world,
reflecting China's status as the largest producer, consumer, and exporter of ozone depleting
substances. Under the previous CPS, the first phase of MP funding (about US$440 million)

phased out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in China in 2010. During the FY13-16 CPS, MP

9 The

proposed lending envelope of about US$1.5 billion per year is sustainable in the medium term, keeping the
IBRD exposure below the US$16.5 billion limit for China set within the context of the Single Borrower Limit
Framework, assuming modest (+/- 10%) fluctuations in disbursements and exchange rates. Given the sensitivity of
exposure projections to these assumptions, IBRD continues to monitor exposure developments.
17

program funds, which may total about $225 million, will focus on phasing-out the next
generation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).
B. Reenergizing the Drivers of Growth-Demand Driven Knowledge Services
45.
As the growth benefits of urbanization and industrialization wane, China's longer-term
challenge is to reenergize and reorient the drivers of growth. These efforts will require a focus on
sustaining productivity growth by recognizing the ongoing shift from low-cost production to higher
value products based on innovation. In turn, this will require reforms that exert competitive pressure
on firms to enhance the pace of innovation both through their own research and development as well
as by engaging in global networks. Such competition will come from completing reforms in product
markets as well as in land, labor, and financial markets. These reforms will need to be complemented
by changes in the fiscal system at the national and sub-national levels. The World Bank Group can
support this structural reform agenda in several ways including by:

*

*
*

*

Supporting fiscal reforms through advisory and analytical work on reforming sub-national
inter-governmental fiscal relations, building up a mid-term fiscal framework at both national
and sub-national levels, improving fiscal transparency and debt management, and introducing
accrual based public finance accounting and performance budgeting.
Assisting with reforms of the state-owned enterprise sector through a mix of advisory
services and technical assistance.
Helping to broaden land, labor and financial market reforms through advisory and
analytical work in selected areas. Building on its knowledge accumulated through previous
engagement, the Bank will continue to support financial sector reform, ranging from financial
stability and crisis preparedness, financial inclusion, and reforming and developing non-bank
financial institutions.
Advising on ways to increase the pace of innovation both at the firm level as well as on the
enabling environment.
C. Strategic Theme One: Supporting Greener Growth

46.
China faces some of the world's most difficult environmental challenges due to its
energy-intensive and resource-intensive growth pattern and binding natural resource
constraints. China has 22 percent of the world's population, but only 6.4 percent of the world's land
area, 7.2 percent of the world's farmland, and 5.8 percent of the world's annual water resources. The
value of environmental depletion and degradation (i.e., environmental externalities) in China's
economy are among the highest of any country. Given the magnitude of China's environmental
impacts, global environmental problems cannot be solved without China's engagement.
47.
Green development can address China's environmental degradation and resource
depletion and also become a new driver for growth. As shown in China 2030, the reforms
underlying green growth can reverse current environmental trends that are both domestically and
globally unsustainable. Green growth combines removing future threats to growth in the form of
resource and pollution constraints with raising the overall rate of growth by increasing efficiency and
accelerating the shift of capital and labor towards sectors with higher total factor productivity growth.
48.
The Bank Group has steadily expanded its focus on environmental sustainability across
its work program. Over 70 percent of the IBRD/GEF portfolio in China has environmental
objectives; and IFC and MIGA continue to help clients identify and address environmental
considerations in their operations and primary supply chains. Over 30 percent of IFC's investment
commitments in China are climate positive, while all IFC investment operations require clients to
18

adhere to environmental standards, including resource efficiency and pollution abatement. The
WBG's "green growth" portfolio can be mapped to seven different CPS outcomes spanning six
different sectors-energy, urban, transport, agriculture, natural resources, and environment-as well
as climate change.
Outcome 1.1: Shifting to a Sustainable Energy Path
49.
China's energy sector faces three main challenges: energy security, environmental
sustainability, and sector efficiency. China is dependent on fossil fuels, with coal accounting for
about 70 percent of primary energy consumption. As a result, 85 percent of CO 2 emissions come
from energy. Although China has the world's largest renewable energy capacity, only 8.8 percent of
energy comes from renewable sources. Shifting to a greener energy supply will benefit China and the
world. To do so, China needs to scale up renewable energy in a cost effective manner, and leapfrog
to the next generation of green energy technologies. The 11th FYP set a target to reduce energy
intensity by 20 percent, which was nearly attained (19.1 percent reduction). The 12 th FYP aims to
reduce energy intensity by a further 16 percent. It sets a target, for the first time, to reduce carbon
intensity by 17 percent, intended to contribute to an overarching goal of reducing carbon intensity in
the economy by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 to 2020. Since the late 1990s, the World Bank Group has
focused on renewable energy and on energy efficiency, where IBRD and IFC programs are
complementary (see Box 7). The Bank Group will continue to support China's efforts to build a
secure, sustainable, and cost-efficient energy sector by:
*

*

*

*

*

*

Enabling efficient and sustainable scale-up of commercial renewable energy
development through investments and advisory services that address how to reduce
incremental costs, improve efficiency, and promote smooth grid integration into the power
systems.
Accelerating energy conservation and investment in energy efficiency through investment
and advisory services at national and local levels that enhance the quality of administrative
measures and encourage greater reliance on the market to deliver energy efficiency.
Piloting innovative investments and policies supporting sustainable energy solutions for
low carbon city development and promoting adoption of cleaner and more efficient
household energy solutions, including in rural areas where solid fuels are widely used.
Helping China extend its Green Building Policy through complementary support from
both IBRD and IFC. Buildings are a large and growing contributor to emissions; and 50
percent of the world's new buildings are expected to be built in China by 2030.
Supporting development and implementation of clean energy policies that encourage
development and deployment of innovative technologies, such as carbon capture and
sequestration and smart grids, and encourage greater use of gas.
Using IFC investment and advisory services to demonstrate market-based approaches
to reducing energy intensity and environmental impact through use of renewable energy,
energy efficient equipment, and natural gas by commercial and industrial users.

19

Box 7: World Bank Group Support for Increasing Energy Efficiency in China
Achieving China's ambitious goal of reducing energy intensity requires significant investments as well as TA and
capacity building for both the public and private sector. To optimize support, IBRD and JFC work together to
leverage and complement each other's programs and instruments.
Complementary TA. IBRD's TA focuses on strengthening government policies and building capacity at national
and provincial levels. For example, the IBRD-financed China Energy Efficiency Financing (CHEEF) program
included a component to help develop NDRC's energy efficiency program. Also, the GEF-financed China
Provincial Energy Efficiency Scale-Up Project provides TA for provincial energy efficiency programs. JFC focuses
its TA on market players. For example, JFC's China Energy Efficiency Finance (CHUEE) program conducted
market studies and provided training and marketing support to its energy efficiency partners, such as commercial
banks, energy service companies, and energy efficiency equipment suppliers.
Complementary activities to help scale up energy efficiency (EE) lending in the banking sector. Under IBRD's
CHEEF program, the government lends to participating financial institutions, who on-lend to industrial enterprises
and energy service companies for EE investments. This credit line arrangement allows banks to familiarize
themselves with and eventually mainstream EE lending. JFC's CHUEE program provides credit risk guarantees to
partner banks for EE project lending. By lowering the risk of lending, the program encourages banks to develop new
EE financing products. IBRD's CHEEF program focuses on medium- and large-sized industrial enterprises, while
JFC's CHUEE program focuses on the SME market.
IBRD and IFC are working together to address new challenges. IBRD and JFC are designing a Green Buildings
program that will exploit each institution's comparative advantage. IBRD can help improve the regulatory
environment and support local governments in developing pilot projects; while JFC can provide private sector-based
tools to examine the business opportunities and share in the project risks.
Outcome 1.2: Enhancing Urban Environmental Services

50.

China's cities are growing at a rate and scale never seen before in human history.

About 380 million people have moved from rural to urban areas over the last two decades; and more
than 200 million people more are expected to migrate by 2025. While urbanization will drive growth
and raise living standards, it also brings tremendous environmental and service delivery challenges.
Smaller cities in particular are struggling to keep pace with demand, especially for sewerage and
waste disposal services. China's city governments are interested in drawing on the experience of
other countries and adopting innovative service delivery technologies that mitigate pollution and
conserve energy and natural resources. The World Bank's urban portfolio provides models of good
urban practices throughout China. Going forward, a key challenge for the World Bank will be to
increasingly work with smaller cities, which have lower capacity and fewer resources, but which are
important for inducing a more equitable and balanced growth process. The World Bank can continue

to help during the CPS period by:
*

Expanding safe water supply in more than 50 small towns and cities, while improving
quality and efficiency.

*

Improving sanitation, solid waste and other basic urban services in selected second-tier
cities, while reducing pollution. WBI will help develop related urban-specific capacity
development and knowledge sharing platforms.

*

*

Supporting private-sector investments in water and sanitation projects, through IFC
investments and MIGA guarantees. IFC is focusing on improving municipal and industrial
water efficiency and water quality, working with water-intensive sectors and firms, especially
in water-scarce areas of the country.
Addressing environmental management, including piloting the cutting edge technologies
to address environmental challenges in large cities and helping to establish "eco cities" that
will be models for cities in China and the world.
20

*

*

Demonstrating ways to integrate cultural heritage conservation and sustainable local
economic development, emphasizing that "conserving the past is a foundation for the
future."
Helping cities build resilience to natural disasters, especially floods; and "building back
better" in the wake of the devastating Wenchuan earthquake in May 2008.

Outcome 1.3 Promoting Low-Carbon Urban Transport
51.
Rapid motorization of China's cities is creating challenges from the local to global
levels. These include: traffic congestion, road accidents, air pollution, farmland conversion, high fuel
consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Recognizing the need to improve urban transport
sustainability in order to address these challenges and reach the national CO 2 target, the 12 th FYP
gives priority to urban public transport development. The World Bank is supporting urban transport
improvements in about 30 of China's 700 cities, creating a critical mass of model projects. In large
cities, there is demand for innovations and best international practice to meet their unprecedented
urban transport problems. In many smaller cities, where there is weak institutional capacity, the Bank
can help strengthen urban transport planning, financing, and management to set the stage for
sustainable, low-carbon urban transport development. The World Bank Group can continue to
support China in promoting low-carbon urban transport by:
*

*

*
*
*

Accelerating the shift to public transport and improving transport efficiency through
city-specific transport investments, giving priority to large cities in the central and western
regions. Projects will be complemented by TA in critical areas, such as integrated transport
and land use planning.
Piloting institutional and technological innovations that have potential for scale up in
cities throughout China, such as public transport integration, transit-oriented development,
travel demand management, and sustainable municipal financing mechanisms.
Helping to establish a national policy framework that promotes efficient and lowcarbon urban transport, drawing on the experience of demonstration projects in pilot cities.
Helping to promote urban transport safety, by demonstrating road safety and traffic
management measures.
Establishing a knowledge platform to disseminate best practices, including an e-learning
module, through AAA and WBI support.

Outcome 1.4: Promoting Sustainable Agriculture Practices
52.
China's agricultural reforms have been successful in producing an inexpensive and
abundant food supply, but the country faces new supply constraints and demand dynamics.
Supply is struggling to keep up with demand, as evidenced by two bouts of double digit food price
inflation over the past three years. Supply constraints include water scarcity, longstanding and
intensifying competition for land, and environmental pressures from livestock waste and overuse of
chemical pesticides and fertilizers. These are compounded by rising rural wages and climate
variability. On the demand side, a dietary shift to a more protein rich diet (meat, dairy) is increasing
demand for feed cereals. Together, these supply and demand dynamics have resulted in a steady
increase of feed cereal imports, challenging China's ambitions of 95 percent grain self sufficiency.
Concerns about food safety further hamper potential for expanding production of high value crops
both for domestic and international markets. As articulated in the 12th FYP, maintaining sustainable
food self-sufficiency, raising farmers' incomes, and constructing the "New Socialist Countryside" are
top government priorities. The World Bank Group can help by:
21

*

*

*

*

*

*

Demonstrating sustainable agricultural and livestock practices that improve farm
productivity and generate local and global environmental benefits, including better ways
to integrate biogas in farming and cooking, improved livestock waste management, and
piloting a carbon credit trading process for household-based greenhouse gas emissions.
Helping to expand agricultural production by improving the productivity of water
through support to water conserving technologies, irrigation systems, water user associations
and water markets. These integrated interventions being piloted in China have been
recognized as globally innovative and are being scaled up.
Developing and testing innovative models for agriculture technology transfer and
application, in order to increase farm income, especially for poor farmers, in high-value
agriculture markets, with a potential for scaling up.
Testing new approaches to ensuring agricultural product quality and safety by piloting a
certification process at the provincial level, with the potential to transfer lessons to other
regions and segments of the food supply chain.
Expanding China's ability to adapt to climate change in the agricultural sector through
research and demonstration of sustainable and climate-resilient agricultural production and
risk management systems.
Using IFC investments in agribusiness to improve productivity through better
environmental practices, such as biomass treatment of animal waste, more efficient use of
land and water resources, and improved waste water treatment.

Outcome 1.5: Demonstrating Sustainable Natural Resource Management Approaches
53.
China's rapid economic growth has put pressure on its scarce natural resources. Water
scarcity is worsening due to overexploitation and water pollution. Chinese policy makers and society
are now giving sustainable natural resource management high priority; and income and living
standards have reached a level where China can afford and is also willing to shift some of its policies.
The shift to sustainable natural resource management began in the 1 0 th FYP, was clearly articulated
in the 1 1 th FYP, and is emphasized further in the 1 2 th FYP. While China's policies have changed
from traditional natural resource management to ecological management, implementation of
ecological management is lagging. The World Bank Group can support China in this area by:
*

*

*

*

Demonstrating ways to better manage ecosystems and conserve biodiversity. Given
China's widely degraded ecosystems, improved management includes promoting ecological
forestry approaches that maximize ecosystem health, soil and water conservation, carbon
sequestration, and climate resilience; exploring market-based schemes to promote
conservation investments in fragile ecosystems such as grasslands and watersheds; and using
concessional funding to promote globally important biodiversity.
Implementing approaches of integrated water resources management at the river basin
level, addressing multiple uses: water scarcity, flooding, pollution, water demands,
economic instruments, and institutional aspects; and building on the recent China Country
Water Resources Partnership Strategy prepared jointly by the World Bank and the Chinese
government.
Demonstrating innovative ways to manage wetlands and lakes, including through the
increased use of wetlands to filter urban and industrial run-off before excess nutrients cause
eutrophication in lakes, rivers, and bays (including the Bohai and South China Seas).
Supporting natural resource property rights and markets in ways that encourage
sustainable use, such as clarifying land use rights in rural and per-urban land use markets,
forest tenure rights, and water rights.
22

*

Demonstrating, including through support from IFC and MIGA, that resource
efficiency makes good business sense, by supporting innovative investment projects,
developing demonstration case studies and knowledge products, and raising awareness
among banks and industrial users.

Outcome 1.6: Demonstrating Pollution Management Measures
54.
China has severe pollution problems that have high economic and public health
impacts. The cost of air pollution is estimated at 6.5 percent of GDP, the cost of water pollution at
2.1 percent of GDP, and soil degradation at 1.1 percent. 10 According to World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates, in 2008 there were 470,000 premature deaths due to ambient air pollution and an
even higher number, 549,000 deaths, due to indoor air pollution. Although air pollution levels have
been improving in recent years, the cost of illnesses from pollution has climbed as the population
ages and the urban populations grows. China has made great strides in controlling urban and
industrial water pollution. Non-point source pollution-from small towns, SMEs, and the rural
sector-is now China's greatest water pollution challenge. The government is committed to reverse
these trends. The World Bank Group can support China in a range of areas, including:
*

*

*

*

*
*

Supporting efforts to reduce urban air pollution, working at both the national level
(providing TA related to standards, monitoring, and regional strategies) and the municipal
level (supporting detailed action plans and investments designed to reduce pollution from the
worst sources).
Supporting efforts to reduce hazardous waste, by continuing to support the reduction of
persistent organic pollutants (POPs)-the byproducts of industrial production and the world's
most toxic chemicals-from the regulatory level to emissions control and urban site cleanup.
Accelerating the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), by remaining a strong
partner in achieving the accelerated phase-out of the HCFC family of chemicals (China is the
world's largest producer, consumer, and exporter of chemicals associated with ODS).
Supporting the reduction of non-point source (NPS) pollution across rural China. In
addition to the strategies related to water pollution addressed in Outcomes 1.2 (urban), 1.4
(agriculture), and 1.5 (wetlands and lakes), the Bank can support efforts to minimize NPS
pollution through regulatory and technical approaches.
Continuing to support China's efforts to improve environmental governance, including
through public disclosure of environmental information.
Working with IFC's private sector clients on pollution abatement by assessing the risk
and potential impacts of their operations, recommending actions to mitigate them, and
tracking performance through regular Performance Standards monitoring. IFC will continue
to support clean technologies and companies engaged in pollution measurement and
management.

Outcome 1.7: Strengthening Institutional and Financial Mechanisms for Climate Change
Climate change is a cross-cutting issue embedded in much of Bank Group support to
55.
China. About half of the World Bank project pipeline will have climate benefits, including in the
energy, urban, transport, waste management, agriculture, and forestry sectors (see Box 8). In
addition, the Bank Group will provide targeted support to help China strengthen institutional, policy,
and financial mechanisms to address the climate challenge, including:

10World Bank calculations (2008 data).

23

Box 8: Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation in China
Climate change mitigation in China is urgent for both China and the world. China's rapidly growing coaldependent economy has made it the world's largest emitter of CO 2Climate change adaption is also an important issue for China. With its long coastline and vast expenses of arid
and semi-arid land, China is vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change, which could intensify water
shortages in northern China, increase the incidence of extreme temperature events and consequent flooding and
droughts, and reduce the yields of major crops.
The Chinese government is taking steps to address climate change. China is embarking on an ambitious national
climate change action plan, which includes national and provincial caps on energy and carbon intensity and piloting
of domestic emissions trading systems for CO 2 in several provinces and large cities. China is likely to adopt absolute
caps on coal use and/or carbon emissions in the next few years. In addition, it is increasingly serious about both low
carbon ("green") development at the policy and investment levels, and climate adaptation, primarily in the water and
agricultural sectors. Finally, China is highly motivated to raise its profile as a proactive and innovative partner to
developing countries in achieving carbon mitigation, and is increasingly doing so through demonstration projects
and expanded South-South cooperation.
China has the World Bank's largest climate change investment program. It provides cross-cutting support for
climate change mitigation and adaption, and the portfolio's emphasis on climate change continues to strengthen.
About half of IBRD/GEF projects financed during this CPS are expected to have positive climate change aspects.
World Bank Group support includes:
* IBRD: The IBRD portfolio supports climate change mitigation in energy, transport, agriculture, and forestry-the
Bank's largest IBRD-financed climate change portfolio.
* Carbon Finance: Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), carbon finance commitments in China over
the past five years totaled $1.25 billion, by far the largest CDM program in the Bank. CDM projects are
distributed across a range of carbon emission reducing sectors-renewable energy (32 percent), energy efficiency
(32 percent), landfill and coalbed methane (16 percent); industrial gases (10 percent), and reforestation (10
percent). Although international purchases of China's certified emissions reductions have declined, the World
Bank will continue to support China in developing new carbon finance mechanisms for possible future projects,
including in the energy and agriculture sectors.
* GEF: GEF provides a successful platform to test innovations at both the national and sub-national levels. Over 60
percent of the Bank's GEF commitments in China address climate change. These operations are fully blended
with IBRD loans, helping to promote innovation, policy dialogue, and capacity building.
* Analytical support: The World Bank is providing TA in several areas. The Bank is helping to model a major
rebalancing of the economy towards green growth, including a fiscally neutral introduction of carbon taxes
generating 5 percent or more of all public revenues. Also, through the Program for Market Readiness, the Bank is
supporting the creation of domestic trading platforms, including standards, registration, and "MRV" (measurable,
reportable, and verifiable) protocols. The Bank is supporting the multi-billion dollar "China CDM Fund" in
developing its early investments in climate finance in China. The Bank supported the NDRC's Climate Change
Department in presenting "China Day" at the November-December 2011 Climate Change Conference (COP 17)
in Durban, South Africa.

* IFC is supporting energy efficiency, renewable energy, clean technology, green buildings, and forestry activities,
all contributing to carbon emission reductions. IFC also supports climate adaptation, such as water use efficiency.
IFC and MIGA are supporting green finance and the Equator Principles in the banking sector (see Box 9).

*

*

Supporting the establishment of carbon trading pilot schemes across China, through the
Partnership for Market Readiness and related trust funds. China has ambitious plans to
implement seven carbon pilot trading schemes by 2013, to be merged into a national scheme
by 2016. The World Bank will function as both a provider of TA and convener of interested
partners and stakeholders.
Exploring innovative climate finance instruments, through TA, investments, and
knowledge exchange supported by WBI's Climate Change Unit. The Bank Group, including
24

*

*

IFC and the carbon finance unit, is an active partner in exploring new ways to use
concessional and market-rate, public sector and private sector, and international and domestic
sources of finance for climate-related investments.
Improving knowledge on the economics of climate change, through TA and analytical
work, including analyzing the costs and benefits of strategies to adapt to projected climate
impacts; promoting access to new technologies to address both mitigation and adaptation
challenges; and mainstreaming low-cost adaptation measures in sectoral investments across
the rural, urban, transport, and energy sectors.
Assisting IFC's private sector clients enhance their environmental and social
sustainability by identifying potential opportunities and delivering approaches that are good
for both the company and the environment as part of IFC's due diligence and by applying the
revised IFC Performance Standards in place since January 2012. IFC will also continue to
help drive sustainability through financial markets using standards such as the Equator
Principles and the Green Credit Guidelines, which show banks how to incorporate
sustainability, including climate change dimensions, into both domestic and overseas lending.
D. Strategic Theme Two: Promoting More Inclusive Development

56.
Addressing the inequalities that have emerged during the reform period is a key social
challenge as China seeks to build a harmonious society. The 11th and 12th FYPs recognize the
emerging limitations of the current growth model and place greater emphasis on addressing
inequality and enhancing the basic security of the population. The disparities are both spatial
(between urban and rural areas; between coastal and inland provinces), and between different social
groups (most notably migrants and local urban residents). Some inequalities are unintended
consequences of market reforms and past failures to deal appropriately with the public goods nature
of investments in human development and with inter-regional disparities. Others, however, are direct
products of policies that institutionalize inequality of opportunity (such as the hukou system) or do
not provide an effective framework for addressing disparities (such as the inter-governmental fiscal
system). The government seeks to overcome such disparities with a stronger emphasis on integration
between urban and rural areas, both in terms of facilitating physical mobility of people and economic
activity, and in terms of policies that harmonize social entitlements and build a deeper and more
equal human capital base and social protection system.
57.
Reforms to enhance equality of opportunity in China are also likely to facilitate its
shifting growth model. In addition to enhancing equity, investments in human capital and a
healthier and more secure population will enhance consumption and contribute to rebalancing. They
will also ensure that China has the quality of workers to navigate the decline in the labor force and
move up the value chain in production. However, in order to translate increased investments in
people into improved social and economic outcomes, there will also need to be ongoing structural
reforms of its health, education and social security systems to increase efficiency of public spending.
58.
The Bank Group will help promote more inclusive development by geographically
focusing on lagging regions and small towns and by supporting policies and demonstration
projects that address inequalities. In the human development sectors health care, social
protection, and skills development-the Bank will continue to emphasize subnational engagement,
focusing on implementation challenges at the local level, with mutual leveraging of lending and
AAA activities, as seen in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces. Also, the Bank will continue to
provide cross-sectoral support for rural and small town development and engage in transport projects
that help balance development. These activities can be mapped to the four outcomes below.

25

Outcome 2.1: Increasing Access to Quality Health Services and Social Protection Programs
59.
Deepening health sector reform is one of China's biggest social challenges. In China, the
urgency of health reform is exacerbated by rapid aging of the population and the increase in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which already account for over 80 percent of the disease burden and
will rise as urbanization progresses. Yet, the health care delivery system remains oriented towards
curative care and its payment and incentive systems do not promote cost-effective or healthpromoting practices. A critical challenge is reorienting China's health delivery system away from
reliance on hospital care and building a revitalized primary health care system well coordinated with
higher levels of care. China has initiated a health system reform that seeks to address a number of the
efficiency and equity challenges of the system, and the Bank will continue to play a role through both
lending and AAA in supporting health system innovations to drive structural change. IFC will
continue to work with the private sector to expand quality health service, especially to middle- and
lower-income families.
60.
As China deepens its social protection reforms, integrating policies and program
administration will become more pressing needs. While the building blocks of a modern social
protection system are largely in place, they remain fragmented in policy and administration terms.
The Bank has had a long-term engagement on pension and social protection reforms in China and
will continue to support second-generation reforms of system integration and the government's
development of aged care services. In health and social protection, the Bank Group will support:

Piloting and evaluating health care innovations that will further the government's
ongoing health system reform agenda, including helping poor rural residents improve
access to health services and reduce their financial risk, improving the quality, efficiency and
coordination of service delivery, and increasing the focus on preventive and primary care.
Investments will continue to be monitored for their gender impacts. Demonstration projects
will be complemented by analytical and policy work drawing on lessons of good practice in
China and globally.
Piloting reforms in pension and health insurance administration to promote social
equity and labor mobility, through integrated management of social insurance programs and
portability of entitlements across jurisdictions.
Sustaining policy advisory and evaluation work on social protection. The Bank will also
support the authorities in evaluating the outcomes of new pension programs for the rural and
urban informal sectors, and continue its work on social assistance to support the government's
efforts to strengthen the safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable citizens.
Helping China face the challenge of an aging population. China will face growing needs
for aged care services, and exploring international good practice and its own emerging
experiences with public-private-community partnerships can help develop new policy and
practices. More broadly, AAA on the impacts of aging on China's economy and society can
support government as it elaborates the policy framework for managing rapid aging.
Through IFC interventions, enhancing private sector provision of quality and
comprehensive healthcare through networks of local and regional hospitals and through
outpatient clinics accessible to the underserved.

Outcome 2.2: Strengthening Skills Development Programs-Including for Migrants
61.
To move up the value chain and become a high-income country, China is seeking to
develop a workforce with the competencies needed for a more complex and dynamic economy.
As enrollment rates at all levels of education rise, it will be important to ensure quality and provide
the core competencies that employers demand. China's National Plan for Medium- and Long-Term
Education and Development lays out a vision for China's education system, including promoting
equality of access at all levels of the system, enhancing educational quality, and promoting
innovation and greater diversity in the education system. The World Bank can provide assistance by:
*

*

*

*

Piloting reforms and investments that improve the quality and relevance of technical
and vocational education (including modular, competency-based curricula, deepening ties
with industry, and promoting life-long learning) and supporting systems to evaluate quality
and guide future reforms. The policy lessons emerging from project engagements will be
supplemented through ongoing analytical work on technical and vocational training, and
exploration of the wider skills challenges in higher education.
Piloting activities that help rural workers transition to urban areas and improve their
incomes and working conditions, including through strengthened worker protections, better
access to skills development and employment services, and reforms to the hukou system to
further remove barriers to labor mobility. Project support will continue to be informed by
analytical work on labor markets and hukou, building on ongoing AAA and China 2030.
Supporting the government's planned expansion and quality enhancement of early
child education and related early child development programs such as nutritional
interventions by piloting and evaluating different models of provision and supporting
financing reforms to ensure that rural, migrant, and poor children have the same early start as
others.
Supporting, through IFC, quality private education institutions and technical and
vocational education and training institutions that have the potential to reach underserved
markets.

Outcome 2.3: Enhancing Opportunities in Rural Areas and Small Towns
62.
Although rural development has been a long standing priority in China, continuing
efforts are needed to address obstacles to rural economic growth and rural income generation.
Many of China's remaining poor live in the upland areas of western and central provinces, where
they face low agricultural productivity and limited access to higher value markets. Improving access
to roads, water supply, and electricity will help increase rural incomes and spur overall rural
development. Promoting non-farm economic activities is an effective means to increase rural
incomes. Small towns can become economic hubs that help people transition out of agriculture and
boost the rural economy. In addition, rural finance reform should be advanced to improve access to
financial services in rural areas, and strengthened land acquisition and compensation policies will
improve land tenure security. The World Bank Group can help by:
*

*

Piloting new ways to boost rural incomes and reduce poverty under the umbrella of the
Development-Oriented Poverty Reduction for China's Rural Areas Strategy (2011-2020),
building on 20 years of collaboration between the government and the Bank in poverty
reduction.
Enhancing secondary town development by helping local governments design integrated
rural-urban development plans, financing small town infrastructure, including water supply
27

*

*

*
*
*

and sanitation, and undertaking analysis on the financial viability of small towns in light of
existing intergovernmental fiscal arrangements.
Providing analytical support to help the government strengthen land tenure security for
rural households and advance land policy reforms to reduce involuntary land transactions
and improve compensation procedures and standards and appeals mechanisms.
Promoting greater financial inclusion. The Bank, building on its experience of promoting
commercially sustainable micro and small enterprise (MSE) lending, will explore ways to
help establish a platform for microfinance knowledge sharing. IFC will continue to promote
MSE lending through investment in financial institutions and support to improve financial
infrastructure, such as credit reporting institutions and secured transactions.
Promoting "inclusive innovation" (innovation that addresses the needs of the poor) as a
tool to help increase productivity and reduce disparities.
Assisting in building capacity to implement China's rural roads program, connecting
villages to urban centers.
Catalyzing private sector investment in lagging regions through support from IFC and
MIGA.

Outcome 2.4: Improving Transport Connectivity for More Balanced Regional Development
63.
Improving inter-urban transport connectivity remains a high priority for sustainable
economic development and for reducing rural-urban and regional disparities. The growth in
freight and passenger flows, in excess of 8.6 percent per annum over the past three decades, is
expected to continue. For passengers, it is coupled with growing needs for differentiated levels of
services as demonstrated by the rapid growth in air transport, road transport, and, more recently, high
speed rail transport. For freight, it is coupled with a need to realign the transport system to support
the economic shift towards domestic consumption and services, as well as the regional rebalancing
towards western and interior provinces. Meeting mobility needs will require additional infrastructure
capacity, broadened service diversity, as well as targeted interventions to ensure vulnerable
populations are provided with suitable access. Meeting such needs sustainably will call for a strong
emphasis on transport modes with lower resource footprint like rail or river transport, as well as
effective multimodal integration and a close integration between the urban and inter-urban networks.
The rapid development of the expressway, highway, airports, and high speed rail system will create a
step change in connectivity. It will support wider economic opportunities for China's citizens, by
shortening economic distance between Chinese cities, leading to greater concentration of economic
activity, with better access to job opportunities and trading centers. These networks will also be
crucial to spreading the opportunities for and benefits from development from the richer coastal areas
of China to poorer inland regions and to giving those areas efficient access to the eastern cities and
ports and widening the pool of firms, labor, service and products within their reach. The World Bank
can help by:
*

*
*

Supporting the development and operation of sustainable and safe intercity transport
solutions meeting future mobility needs, by participating in projects connecting urban
centers, particularly in western and central provinces, with an emphasis on integration and
lower carbon options.
Demonstrating the application of intermodal integration concepts through selected
projects, leading to an optimal use of each mode.
Increasing the development impact of expressways on local communities, by
strengthening planning that ensures effective interface between expressways and the local
road network, and improving safety and asset management of the expressway system.
28

*

Piloting innovations that reduce the environmental impact of roads and expressways,
such as an environmental compliance framework for contractors and a safeguards compliance
monitoring system.
E. Cross-Cutting Theme: Advancing Mutually Beneficial Relations with the World

64.
China is playing an increasingly important role in the world economy, and is expanding
its role in international cooperation. Over the last five years, China has added US$4.6 trillion to
global nominal GDP. It is the world's largest exporter and second largest manufacturer. Moreover,
China is increasing its role and influence in international organizations and institutions. It will be the
third largest shareholder in the World Bank upon completion of the capital increase approved in
2010, and is becoming an active member and shareholder of other multilateral development
institutions, as well as an active and influential member of international and regional groupings such
as the G-20 and ASEAN+3. Although China's official aid flows to other countries are relatively
small, China is a significant source for concessional lending, export credits, and FDI to countries in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America and is becoming the most important source of financing in sectors
such as infrastructure. China started contributing to IDA in IDA15 (2007) and increased its
contribution and engagement in IDA16. Other countries increasingly look to China as a source of
knowledge and experience given its record of growth and poverty reduction.
65.
While China's growing role creates numerous opportunities and benefits, it also creates
new challenges and responsibilities. These include calls for China to assume greater responsibility
in addressing global challenges such as climate change. Some have expressed concerns about
China's exchange rate policy, capital account restrictions, and foreign exchange reserves. Consistent
with China's economic importance, the government is facilitating a gradual increase in the
international use of the RMB and taking measures to relax capital controls. In the field of
international development assistance, China is being called upon to harmonize its economic
cooperation programs and approaches with those of traditional partners, and to increase its
contributions to multilateral assistance funds and channels.
66.
Supporting China's growing global role is an increasingly important aspect of the Bank
Group's engagement and strategy, drawing from knowledge and relationships built through
lending and AAA. The Bank Group's engagement in development issues throughout China positions
the Bank Group to facilitate China's South-South cooperation and to support China as a global
stakeholder. Given that China is now a contributor to IDA, the IDA replenishment process also offers
China an opportunity to deepen its engagement in the global development policy dialogue.
Supporting China's South-South Cooperation
67.
China is increasingly engaging in South-South knowledge exchange (SSKE), both as a
key dimension of its own development cooperation policy and in response to requests from other
developing countries. Chinese ministries, specialized agencies, think tanks, and other institutions in
virtually all sectors are being called upon to provide technical assistance or training to other
developing countries. As a result, there is a growing need for Chinese institutions to effectively and
objectively document China's own experiences (both successes and failures) and to develop capacity
to share these experiences and help adapt them to the needs of other countries. The Bank Group can
help by:
*

Working together with Chinese knowledge institutions to analyze and document key
policies, programs, and institutions that are of greatest interest to other countries; and to
disseminate China's experience through SSKE.
29

*

*

*
*

Enhancing the capacity of Chinese institutions engaged in SSKE, including the
International Poverty Reduction Center and Asia Pacific Finance and Development Center;
and help Chinese researchers and academic institutions foster linkages with counterparts in
other countries.
Facilitating links between networks of Chinese practitioners and related practitioner
networks in other countries in fields such as urban planning, climate change, health,
agricultural research, environmental protection, accounting, auditing and financial reporting,
and assisting China in sharing its experience in global public goods areas such as alternative
energy and carbon finance.
Helping to ensure that China's SSKE activities involve "mutual learning."
Facilitating China's own access to international knowledge and experience, both through
project assistance and through practitioner exchange, particularly with other middle-income
countries (MICs).

68.
The Bank Group can play a role in enhancing the development impact of China's
international economic engagement and cooperation. China, like a number of other MICs, is both
a provider and recipient of aid. Moreover, Chinese firms both private and state-owned are rapidly
increasing the level and scope of their activities in other developing countries, both through trade and
outward FDI. A good deal of this engagement takes place in the context of China's economic
cooperation, involving an integrated package of aid, trade, and investment. As Chinese firms become
increasingly active in international markets, particularly in developing countries, they are beginning
to encounter challenges and difficulties in areas such as environmental and labor standards and
understanding of local business practices. The Bank Group can help by:
*

*

*

*

*

*

Sharing global experience in adopting and implementing standards for outward
investment, such as the Equator principles, through policy dialogue and AAA in the context
of IFC support for South-South investment (see Box 9 on China's Green Credit Policy)."
Through IFC and MIGA, assisting Chinese enterprises to invest sustainably in
developing countries, and to establish links with local supply chains in order to increase
opportunities for local value added and technology transfer.
Continuing exchanges on international development cooperation to facilitate China's
participation in international development partnership networks, and jointly organizing
workshops on international development cooperation.
Providing Chinese financial institutions, through IFC, the opportunity to participate in
financing projects outside China, such as China Development Bank's and China EXIM
Bank's participation in the financing of the Vodafone project in Ghana.
Exploring opportunities for project-level cooperation in third countries under various
tripartite/trilateral and multipartite frameworks1 2 and based on specific demand from
recipient countries. Bank Group instruments include Bank lending for joint or
complementary projects, and IFC/MIGA support for enterprise investments.
Developing innovative RMB-denominated trade assets financing schemes that will help
accelerate trade finance, stimulate the development of an RMB trade risk sharing market, and
mobilize South-South trade financing from Chinese banks, such as China's EXIM Bank.

" The Equator Principles, launched by private banks in June 2003 and based on IFC Performance Standards, are
voluntary standards for determining, assessing, and managing environmental and social risk in project financing.
12 China's

White Papers on Economic Cooperation with Africa (December 2010) and Foreign Aid (April 2011) both

signal the Government's interest in increasing its collaboration with multilateral institutions within the context of its
international cooperation.
30

*

Facilitating deeper Chinese engagement on IDA policies and global development
priorities through the IDA replenishment process.

Supporting China as a Global Stakeholder
69.
As China's global role increases, so does the importance of China's positions within
global economic governance institutions and China's policies influencing global public goods.
China has benefitted tremendously from globalization and from the rules and norms of institutions of
global economic governance, most notably the multilateral trading system. China has been a strong
advocate for greater voice by developing countries within institutions like the World Bank, and for
an enhanced role for the G-20. Other countries will now be looking to China to use its increased
influence in ways that promote common interests. In addition, China's policies and behavior are
important in influencing a number of global public goods, most notably climate change. Given the
size of China's population and of its economy, reducing global carbon emissions requires China's
active engagement. China's people and economy stand to benefit from positive action to preserve
global public goods. The Bank can support China in its role as a global stakeholder by:

*

Continuing to engage in dialogue on China's global economic governance role and
undertaking analytical work that helps China assess policy options for further liberalization,
such as in the services sector.

*

Undertaking analysis that encourages China to play a productive role in proposing
solutions and developing consensus on climate change and other global public goods.
The Bank will also continue to help China identify and implement initiatives to reduce
carbon emissions and to promote environmental sustainability.

Box 9: China's Green Credit Policy
Since 2007, when China launched its Green Credit Policy, IFC has advised Chinese banks on the Equator Principles
and has supported Chinese government agencies in adapting international environmental and social (E&S) standards
to China's context.
In 2008, the China Industrial Bank, an IFC investee bank, adopted the Equator Principles, becoming the first
Equator Bank in China and in emerging markets in Asia. IFC supported the Industrial Bank in this endeavor by
providing TA and training and sharing knowledge through IFC's network of Equator Principles Financial
Institutions.
IFC has also promoted international E&S standards through joint deals with China Development Bank (CDB) and
the China EXIM Bank. In May 2011, IFC facilitated participation of the CDB and China EXIM Bank in an IFC
syndication in Ghana. Similarly, in May 2011, IFC invested in the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund
(sponsored by China EXIM Bank), which applies E&S policies similar to IFC's Performance Standards.
In February 2012, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) launched Green Credit Guidelines with IFC
support. These guidelines require banks to develop and implement strategies for E&S risk management and E&S
friendly investment and to reduce their own environmental footprint. They also encourage banks to adopt
international E&S standards in their overseas investment engagements.
China's experience in developing green credit policies is being shared with other countries through South-South
exchanges facilitated by IFC. Vietnam, for example, is now replicating China's experience
IFC will continue to support Chinese agencies and banks in sharing their experience and further building their
capacity to implement Equator Principles and Green Credit Guidelines, including in their overseas engagements. In
related work, the World Bank is supporting South-South exchanges with China's Ministry of Environmental
Protection on investment-related environmental assessment and social safeguard policies.

31

F. Delivering the World Bank Group Program
70.
The Bank Group will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity Beijing Country
Office. The Bank office currently comprises about 120 staff. WBI's Regional Coordinator is based in
Beijing. Since 1992, IFC has maintained an office in Beijing co-located with the Bank office. In July
2000, a joint IFC/World Bank regional office for private sector development was established in Hong
Kong SAR, China. In 2002, IFC opened an office in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, to provide advisory
and investment services primarily to SMEs in the western region of China. MIGA has established an
Asia hub office in Singapore as well as a presence in Beijing, co-located with IFC.
71.
The Bank Group will continue to work closely with national partners and, where
possible and relevant, with international partners. The Bank Group places great importance on
partnering with local agencies, research institutes, and universities. Bilateral donors have shifted their
focus mainly to global public goods and South-South cooperation, providing opportunities for
collaboration in those areas. The Bank will collaborate with UN agencies where possible, such as
with WHO on NCDs and UNICEF on early childhood development and education. Like the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) lends about US$1.44 billion per year to China, mainly
for infrastructure and the environment. The World Bank and ADB collaborate and exchange
information at the program level. The ADB's country partnership strategy for 2012-2015 focuses on
three pillars: inclusive growth; environmentally sustainable growth; and regional cooperation and
integration.
72.
The CPS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank Group's program
of support (see Annex 1). CPS outcome indicators will be monitored over the CPS period. Most
milestones are expected to be completed by the CPS Progress Report in 2014. Results during this
CPS period will come from existing operations and quicker-disbursing operations included in this
CPS; many of the new operations to be undertaken during this CPS will not be completed by the end
of the CPS (FY16).
73.
The Government of China and the Bank will meet regularly to review project
preparation and implementation and address weaknesses. For example, during their most recent
lending program discussions, MOF, NDRC, and the World Bank agreed to work together to
strengthen project monitoring and evaluation and planning of AAA. MOF also requested increased
project management training, especially procurement and financial management, and better
communication between task teams and local authorities.
74.
Trust funds are fully integrated in the CPS and will be managed accordingly. Trust
fund-financed activities are implemented in accordance with the same fiduciary requirements as
IBRD-financed operations; and analytical work and policy notes funded by trust funds undergo the
same rigorous review as Bank budget-funded analytical work.
75.
Continued strong support will be provided to ensure compliance with Bank fiduciary
and safeguard policies. This will be challenging given the large geographic span of the portfolio and
given that many new projects are being implemented in secondary and smaller cities unfamiliar with
World Bank procedures. The Bank's procurement team will continue to provide procurement training
to project management office (PMO) staff, implementing agencies, and tendering companies. The
Bank's financial management team will continue to conduct training for counterparts, including
PMOs, auditors, and finance bureaus.
76.
The Bank will also continue to support greater use of country systems. The World Bank
and the ADB are working together to help harmonize procurement legislation and prepare model
32

bidding documents. Financial management is already harmonized with some of the government's
own systems: project financial management is undertaken in accordance with Circular 13 issued by
the Ministry of Finance for all donor funds; and the China National Audit Office (CNAO) Foreign
Funds Application Audit Department conducts audits of projects. CNAO is also increasing its focus
on performance audits and assessment of sustainable development. The results of the project
financial and performance audits are now made available to the public. Additionally, the Bank is
facilitating South-South cooperation in accounting, auditing, and financial reporting to benefit other
countries in the region.
77.
The Bank Group will further strengthen gender's integration into its work, building on
good practices and lessons learned from the previous CPS period (see para. 33(v) and Box 5). During
project preparation, the Bank's social development team will review project design to analyze
opportunities to mainstream good practices. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that
operations in the areas where the Bank will be most strongly engaged environment, energy,
transport, and urban development-are gender informed. 13 A China Country Gender Action Plan will
be updated every two years to assess the gender dimensions of the portfolio and make
recommendations. In addition to gender mainstreaming, participatory design elements and use of
enhanced complaints handling mechanisms will be considered and discussed with government
counterparts. IFC will continue to deepen its work on gender in both its investment and advisory
work, with a focus on supporting women-owned businesses and facilitating better targeting of
women clients in the banking sector.
78.
The Bank Group will prepare a CPS Progress Report in 2014, or earlier if needed, to
evaluate progress toward CPS outcomes and adjust the strategy and program.

" An operation is defined as "gender informed" if: (i) The project documents explicitly refer to analysis and/or
consultation on gender related issues, and/or; (ii) The project include action(s) that is expected to narrow gender
disparities, including through specific actions to address the distinct needs of women/girl (men/boys) and/or to have
positive impact(s) on gender equality, and/or; (iii) the project documents explicitly refer to mechanisms for
monitoring and evaluatinggender impacts, and facilitate gender disaggregated analysis.

33

IV. MANAGING RISKS

79.
Risks to the Bank Group's development effectiveness in China are moderate given
China's good capacity, strong ownership of the Bank Group program, and track record of high
performance.
80.
As any open economy, China faces risk related to the global economy, which is likely to
remain uncertain and volatile for some time. Unlike many counties, however, China's fiscal and
debt position allows it the space to respond with stimulus measures that could substitute domestic
demand for external demand. There is a risk that stimulus measures would postpone tackling, or even
exacerbate, long-term structural weaknesses that will affect growth down the line. Short-term
stimulus measures should be designed to support medium- and long-term structural reforms by
increasing expenditures for health, education, pensions, and the environment and decreasing them for
infrastructure and enterprises. In the medium-term, policies to rebalance growth from investment and
exports towards consumption will enable the economy to better withstand external demand shocks.
81.
Domestic economic policy risks need to be managed. The uncertain trajectory of the
ongoing (and necessary) adjustment in China's property sector constitutes a significant near-term risk
given the sector's importance for the overall economy. Risks associated with the recent extensive offbudget borrowing by China's local governments could also spill over into fiscal and financial
pressures, and need to be managed. However, public debt sustainability is not a major issue of
concern, because total debt stocks remain well below those in many other countries and the economy
continues to grow relatively rapidly. Also, the authorities have launched a "local financing platform"
audit system to increase transparency and control of fiscal debt.
82.
Several trends may increase social tensions, which, if unresolved, present risks to
growth and stability. One source is China's relatively wide economic and social disparities,
exacerbated by barriers to labor mobility and policies that favor enterprise profits and implicitly tax
household incomes. Social risks are also expected to grow as the rising ranks of the middle class and
higher education levels increase the demand for better social governance and greater opportunities
for participation in public policy debate and implementation. This can already be seen in the
increasing public discussion about the quality of growth. The government is taking measures to
address income disparities and shift the focus from quantity to quality of growth.
83.
Vested interests could thwart the efforts of China's government in implementing
structural reforms. Unlike in 1978, significant vested interests have accumulated behind the
industry-led, export-oriented, energy- and resource-intensive pattern of production. Not only do they
impose costs on downstream production, they have also become lobbies opposing reforms.
84.
At the project level, risks are moderate, but more attention to capacity building will be
needed. The shift to central and western provinces and smaller cities means that counterparts will be
less experienced and may require more support during preparation and implementation.
85.
The CPS is also subject to Bank-related risks. Going forward, the Bank may need to be
even quicker to adjust to the fast pace and scope of China's development and needs. The main risk to
the Bank Group's development effectiveness is its own ability to nimbly deliver innovation and
cutting-edge knowledge.

Annex 2: Gender and Development in China
1. To inform the FY13-FY16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the World Bank conducted two
pieces of background analysis: a literature review of gender in key sub-sectors; and a review of good
practices in mainstreaming gender in the lending portfolio during the previous CPS period. The Bank
also drew upon analysis in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) Companion to the 2012 World
Development Report on Gender Equality and Development.
2. Over the last two decades, China has made remarkable progress in reducing gender
disparities. An appropriate legal and organizational framework is in place for protecting women and
implementing China's strategy-the Program for the Development of Chinese Women (20112020).14 The 12th Five Year Plan includes a significant gender dimension to its focus on inclusive
development, focusing on ensuring that women are able to benefit from development gains. It
emphasizes the protection of women's legal rights and the importance of ensuring women's access to
basic services. It further highlights the need to improve women's ability to contribute to economic
development by promoting female employment and entrepreneurship.
3. China has improved women's access to health and education. From 1990 to 2008, there was
a dramatic decline in maternal mortality from 110 to 38 (per 100,000 live births). On the other hand,
non-communicable diseases have increased. This is partly linked to the incidence of tobacco use
among men at 59.5 percent in 2008 (compared to 3.7 percent among women). Gender parity has been
achieved in education at primary and secondary levels, with the share of female students now slightly
higher than that of male students.
4. Rates of female labor force participation have remained high in China at 75 percent in
2008. Economic reforms in recent decades have increased the range of opportunities for men and
women in paid employment. However, rates of female employment have stagnated behind those of
men over the last 10 years. Once in the labor force, women earn approximately 70 percent of men's
wages for similar work and tend to have less secure employment and longer periods of
unemployment. Access to child-care has become increasingly important for women's labor force
participation (particularly for migrant women), following child-care reform. Large numbers of
female migrants to urban areas, often migrating alone given the restrictive migrant registration
system, face multiple disadvantages, such as segregated jobs, lower wages, and poor working
conditions. The mandatory age of retirement for women at 55 (60 for men), means that men and
women have significant differences in retirement prospects in urban areas. Few female migrant
workers participate in pension, unemployment, or workplace injury insurance schemes, or receive
maternity insurance.
5. Women from ethnic minority communities and remote rural areas remain particularly
vulnerable, and lag behind in terms of access to basic services and economic opportunities.
Women remain less likely to own land in spite of an enabling legal framework. Values and norms
regarding the transmission of rights to land to women (in the case of inheritance for example) can

The legal framework includes: the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and
Interests of Women; the recently revised Marriage Law, providing protection against domestic violence; and recent
amendments to land laws to confer women equal rights to land titling. Organizations include: the National Working
Committee on Women and Children and All China Women's Federation.
14

44

create difficulties in enforcing legislation. The amount of land per capita for female headed
households was 70 percent that in male headed households (2008). In the six regions where
minorities are concentrated the school enrollment rate is largely lower than the national average. The
average dropout rate in these same provinces is about three times the national average. In addition,
urban labor force participation also fell faster among minority women than among Han women
between 1990 and 2000, which is consistent with a widening gap in income and occupational
attainment between Han and ethnic minorities.
6. China has a high proportion of women parliamentarians (21 percent) compared to other
countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region. The proportion of women in local government in
urban areas is double that at 48 percent. The promotion of the village self-government system has
helped expand opportunities for women in village governance. In critical areas such as environmental
policy, energy, and transport, which are central to the current World Bank Group portfolio in China,
national programs are not systematically informed by an understanding of the different needs and use
of resources by both women and men. The significant gender gaps in employment in these areas and
women's weaker voice in the governance of these sectors may also hinder their ability to help
determine options and sector priorities.

CHINA: CPS (2006-2010) COMPLETION REPORT
Date of CPS: May 23, 2006 (Report No. 35435- CN)
Date of Progress Report: Board discussion January 22, 2009 - Report No. 46896-CN
Period Covered by the CPS Completion Report: July 2006 to December 2011
Summary of Evaluation Ratings
ProgramPerformance
China has made significant progress in the areas of the 1 1 th Five Year Plan identified as Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) engagement pillars, and the World Bank Group (WBG) has supported
these advancements. Based on WBG's country team assessments and consultations with the
authorities and stakeholders, WBG program performance is rated in the aggregate as satisfactory.1 5
All 35 outcomes identified in the CPS have been achieved or partially achieved. Bank support has
made a significant impact on the lending side through innovation, demonstration, and scale-up, and
on the AAA front through intensified knowledge engagements, many of which leveraged and
complemented operations. IFC's China program was focused on relevant CPS outcomes and is rated
satisfactory. IFC contributed to relevant CPS outcome areas where it has a comparative advantage.
The development outcomes of IFC investment services operations improved consistently during the
CPS period, surpassing IFC average in FY11 while advisory services engagements were marked by
far reaching operations in access to finance and climate change initiatives. Of IFC advisory services
engagements completed during the reporting period, 74 percent led to significant results, including
more than US$4.9 trillion in financing facilitated through credit reporting and secured transactions
systems, and 17.8 million tons of GHG emissions avoided annually. 16
WBG Performance
The Bank's performance in strategy design and program implementation is rated as satisfactory. The
CPS strategy was appropriate to country priorities and goals, as evidenced by close alignment with
the 11 th Five Year Plan and strong country ownership. The program proposed in the 2006-2010 CPS
was realized as envisaged with only minor shifts to meet exceptional circumstances (e.g., postearthquake reconstruction support) and shifting emphasis within the program (e.g., intensification of
support for China's global engagement). IBRD portfolio performance compares favorably with other
large Bank borrowers. The portfolio was well managed and performance was solid. Trust funds have
been used effectively, especially in the areas of environment, climate change, and global
engagement. IFC's performance is also rated as satisfactory. The program sought to align investment
and advisory services to deliver greater reach and development results. IFC quickly responded to
changes in the country context and has started to streamline its focus towards high impact initiatives
in frontier regions/rural growth, climate change, and South-South investments. Steady improvement

in development outcome tracking system (DOTS) indicators can be linked partly to the quality of
project supervision during the period, which was satisfactory in 96 percent of projects evaluated
between 2006 and 2010. For those operations reporting on additionality, over 90 percent achieved or
partially achieved the expected additionality. From FY06 to end-201 1, IFC's China program reached
historical highs with more than US$3 billion in over 100 projects, representing 60% of total
investment volume since its first investments in 1985.
On the basis of the rating of the Bank and IFC, the overall performance of the World Bank Group is
rated as satisfactory.

Introduction

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the effectiveness of the
2006-2010 CPS for China. The CPS was aligned with the Government of China's 11 th Five Year
Plan (FYP). The CPSCR also evaluates program activities in 2011, because the new CPS covers
WBG engagement from FY13-FY16. This evaluation draws on findings of the mid-term CPS
Progress Report as well as consultations with clients and stakeholders in the capital and the
provinces.
II.

Progress on China's Long-Term Development Goals

In 2006, when the CPS was prepared, China had been achieving impressive growth for three decades
(annual GDP growth of about 9 percent since 1978 when reforms started). The number of poor had
declined significantly with over 500 million people coming out of poverty. The country had shifted
from a centrally planned to a market model, and China had become the world's fourth largest
economy and the third largest trading nation. Yet, it remained a developing country with per capita
GDP of about US$1,740 and about 135 million people living on less than US$1/day. Maintaining the
pace of rapid growth was a key challenge along with resource demands, environmental impacts, and
rebalancing the pattern of development to avert or mitigate emerging inequalities. China's 1 1 th FYP
(2006-2010) aimed to address these and other challenges to build an inclusive harmonious society
with higher living standards for its citizens, and it made significant progress in implementing the
Plan.
III.

WBG Program Performance

With WBG financial investments accounting for less than 0.02 percent of China's overall Gross
Domestic Investment (GDI) over the CPS period, any attribution of the country's achievements to
WBG interventions needs to be approached with modesty. The WBG strategy revolved around
innovative interventions that leveraged its international expertise and cross-country experience.
Lending operations were built around cutting-edge knowledge-based pilots that could be replicated
on a national scale. They tested reforms to support institutional development, the transition to a
market economy, and sustainable resource management practices. The WBG's convening power
supported China's integration in the global economy, and its expertise facilitated two-way knowledge
transfer and a growing program of South-South exchange that allowed China to share its
development experiences with other countries. IFC's and MIGA's investments, guarantees, and
advisory services helped facilitate both domestic and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), fostered
innovative transactions, and supported projects which utilize best practices to create demonstration
effects, with a particular focus on frontier and lagging regions
47

WBG assistance was organized around five thematic pillars (see below, and Attachment 1). The CPS
results framework offered a good starting point, but in retrospect the specific goals and anticipated
outcomes could have been better differentiated and fewer in number. Also, it would have been
helpful to focus more on milestones to gauge progress towards outcomes rather than outputs.
The mid-term review undertaken for the 2009 CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) found that the original
strategic priorities and objectives remained valid. It noted that progress was on track and in line with
China's advancements under its 1 1 th FYP goals. As mid-course adjustments, the review noted
intensified engagement in supporting China's integration into the global economy, greater emphasis
on energy efficiency objectives and climate change issues, and accelerated implementation of
integrated rural-urban development, particularly through the Guangdong and Chongqing pilot
initiatives. It formalized Bank support for disaster risk management, and for earthquake
reconstruction in the wake of the tragic May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
Since the 2009 Progress Report, progress under the CPS pillars has continued to be strong. The
preparation by the World Bank and the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council of
the joint China 2030: Building a Modern, Harmonious, and Creative, High-Income Society, was a
particularly important collaboration initiated in September 2010 and launched at a conference in
February 2012.
Pillar 1: Integrating China into the world economy
Outcome Status: China has emerged as an increasingly influential player in the global economy with
a growing role in international economic institutions and South-South exchange. It has increased its
engagement with regional development banks and has shifted its role in IDA to that of a contributor.
There is high and growing demand from other countries for investment, trade, and knowledgesharing with China and the country has become a significant source of financing and investment in
infrastructure, particularly in Africa.
WBG Support: The WBG has facilitated engagement through a number of activities, particularly
experience-sharing with other developing countries, most notably in Africa. It has contributed to
institutional strengthening through its advisory support (e.g., on trade, debt management, SouthSouth), while MIGA and IFC have provided support for enhancing the quality of China's
investments and related knowledge sharing, especially in financial and non-financial risk mitigation
and standard setting (e.g., environment and social, and corporate governance). The WBG maintained
a productive dialogue with relevant Chinese institutions on issues of development cooperation and
aid effectiveness both directly and through the China-DAC Study Group. Moreover, Chinese
ministries and agencies have been assisted in documenting and sharing development experience on
issues such as industrial zones, health, water, and poverty reduction. WBI has been particularly
active in supporting experience sharing and in building the capacity of key Chinese South-South
cooperation institutions, most notably the International Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC)
and the Asia Pacific Finance and Development Center (AFDC). The Bank has worked well as a
trusted partner and facilitator in disseminating knowledge about China's development experience
with the world, as well as supporting China's integration with the global economy. A Department for
International Development (DFID)-financed trust fund provided support for a number of important
studies and activities aimed at improving information exchange and knowledge sharing.
Bank reports (such as the Quarterly Economic Reports and the book China: New Trade Issues in the
Post-WTO Accession Era) have helped generate accurate information on China's economic and social
48

development, its impacts on the world economy, and how it is managing a resource-scarce economy.
The Bank collaborated more closely with Chinese research partners to gain from their local
knowledge and to build their analytical capacity. The Bank also worked with China on regional
initiatives including the Greater Mekong Sub-region, the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) program, and management of the avian flu threat. Following IFC's advisory
services, knowledge sharing and exchanges between the Chinese and Vietnamese governments and
financial sectors have resulted in plans by the State Bank of Vietnam to develop environment and
social (E&S) risk management guidelines similar to China's Green Credit Policy. IFC is also
assisting the Chinese private sector in investing profitably and sustainably in other parts of the world.
In 2010, IFC made its first investment in a Chinese company operating in Sub-Saharan Africa CREJ Estates in Tanzania. In 2011, IFC co-invested with China EXIM Bank, China Investment
Corporation, BOCI and CCCC, to support infrastructure projects in ASEAN countries. China
Development Bank and China EXIM Bank became the first Chinese banks to participate in an IFCsyndicated parallel loan for a project in Africa: Ghana Vodafone.
Pillar 2: Reducing poverty, inequality, social exclusion
Outcome Status: China has continued to make progress in reducing poverty, building on the
dramatic reductions after 1980. Policy changes aiming to enhance equity and quality have been
introduced, including the abolition of the agricultural land tax, the nationwide introduction in 2008 of
free compulsory education, the expansion of student financial assistance to tertiary education, and the
adoption of ambitious 1 2 th FYP targets for universal early childhood education coverage. China's
health reforms represent a major achievement in health equity by providing basic near-universal
coverage through insurance mechanisms and a public health package. A means-tested cash transfer
program (Social Safety Net) was rolled out across rural China (dibao), and a major national initiative
to achieve comprehensive coverage of rural pensions is rapidly expanding, as well as a more recent
pension program for the urban informal sector. To improve the conditions of work for Chinese
workers and strengthen worker protection, the Labor Contract Law was enacted, and integrated ruralurban development models of social security and other entitlement programs are being piloted. In
November 2011, the government adjusted the official rural poverty line to be more in line with
international standards (a step strongly supported by the Bank), qualifying 100 million more people
for a variety of benefits that will bring more resources to poor regions. Despite progress during the
period of the 1 1 th FYP in reducing poverty (average rural per capita incomes exceeded 1 1 th FYP
targets) and slowing the rise of inequality, continuing to reduce poverty and reversing inequality
remain important challenges in China.
WBG Support: The Bank Group supported government efforts to improve social safety nets for the
rural and urban poor, including through key analytical and diagnostic pieces on the dibao program.
The From Poor Areas to Poor People study, the result of a multi-year analytical effort, provided a
comprehensive overview of poverty reduction progress, as well as recommendations to address key
challenges. In the education sector, policy notes (Education Sector Review and Early Childhood
Development and Education) were helpful in informing the medium- and long-term strategy for
educational reform and development, with the Government now emphasizing Early Childhood
Development and Education (ECDE) under the 1 2 th FYP, and policymakers increasingly focused on
the importance of addressing inequity in higher education. The Bank's ECDE AAA has also led to
requests for further collaboration on impact evaluation by the China Development and Reform
Foundation.

49

Bank assistance was welcomed in formulating the Human Development System reform strategy for
national and sub-national governments, including the health system reform master plan. AAA on
non-communicable diseases (NCD) prepared in coordination with the Chinese Ministry of Health
and the World Health Organization presented evidence on the economic and social consequences of
explosive increases in NCDs in China and proposed a range of policies and strategies to confront and
prevent them. Bank-supported AAA and the Rural Health Project contributed significantly to
building impact evaluation capacity for health system reform, for example, by mobilizing trust fund
resources to hold impact evaluation training workshops in partnership with the National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The WBG also supported the formulation of a
monitoring and evaluation indicator framework, as well as data collection for the health system
reform mid-term evaluation. In addition, analytical and advisory work on the pension and elderly
care systems were sustained, with a major policy report on directions of pension reform, diagnostic
work on the situation of rural elderly, and initial work on aged care under social protection
programmatic AAA.
WBG financing (investments, TA, TFs) supported pilots of new mechanisms as well as capacity
building with social sector projects on poverty reduction, rural health, migrant training and
employment, and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). These activities helped
support continued poverty innovations by connecting small farmers to higher value chains through
bottom-up and top down approaches in agriculture. The WBG and provincial authorities have also
been developing models for integrated rural-urban development in both Chongqing and Guangdong.
The participatory approach and Community Driven Development (CDD) models have been advanced
through Bank-financed activities, including the Poor Rural Communities Development Project,
supported by the Bank and DFID, which extended the participatory approach to poor villages in 18
counties in western China and piloted the CDD model in 4 other counties in which village
committees approved and evaluated subprojects, allowing for community control of funds. The
follow-on Sustainable Development in Poor Rural Areas project continues to advance CDD
approaches in Henan Province, Shaanxi Province, and Chongqing Municipality, and incorporates
GEF co-financing to address potential climate-change risks and land degradation issues closely
linked with rural poverty. Poverty reduction efforts have also included a strong gender focus, with
projects identifying entry points for women's participation in community-based activities and
creating space for women's voices to be heard in community-based planning processes.
Bank-supported projects also financed upgrades of transport infrastructure and improved network
management and traffic safety. Rural roads were a particular focus of this effort, which also included
expressways, railroads, and waterways linking inland provinces to the dynamic coast so that
transportation benefits accrue to the poor. IFC was involved in supporting private enterprise growth
in both cities and rural areas all over China as the main source of sustainable job creation.
Overall WBG support has increasingly shifted to poorer lagging regions. As of end-FYI 1, about 86
percent of projects in terms of loan/grant amount are in the interior and western provinces. IFC has
also mobilized more and more resources to support the development of the frontier regions. In FY0609, only 30% of IFC's new projects were located in frontier regions, while the percentage rose to
more than 60% from FY10 to end-201 1.
Pillar 3: Managing resource scarcity and environmental challenges
Outcome Status: CPS Pillar 3 aimed to support China in creating a resource-efficient society
(including meeting the Government's goal of reducing energy intensity by 20 percent from 2005 to
50

2010), improving natural resource management to reduce degradation and depletion, and meeting
international environmental commitments. During the 1 1 th FYP, there has been a reversal of the
negative trends in energy intensity, air pollution (though only in some cities and some parameters),
water pollution (some waterways), as well as substantial progress on wastewater treatment, water
savings (in some basins), and better management of lands and forests. There are major government
efforts underway to enhance energy efficiency, develop renewable energy sources, and address
climate change issues. In 2008, the Industrial Bank of China, an IFC client, adopted the Equator
Principles (EPs), a voluntary environmental and social risk-management framework based on IFC
performance standards, becoming the first EP bank in China and the Asian emerging markets. In
addition, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, one of the world's largest banks by market
value, runs a 12 category environmental and social risks system and applies the standards in its
overseas investment activities. China EXIM Bank is also using a performance standards-based
internal environmental and social risks review process. Despite China's achievements in these areas,
significant challenges remain. China is the largest emitter of Greenhouse Gas (GHG), and GDP
remains energy-intensive.
WBG Support: WBG activities with environment objectives have expanded steadily and comprise
more than 76 percent of new IBRD lending (81 percent including GEF) as of December 2011. There
is a growing pipeline of climate change mitigation actions. WBG support to climate mitigation
through its energy, transport, urban, forestry and agriculture sector interventions exceeds envisaged
CPS levels. In IFC, 100% of its investment operations are required to adhere to applicable
environmental and social performance standards, including resource efficiency and pollution
abatement. In addition, mitigating climate change is a key focus area for IFC, and IFC has
successfully partnered with three selected Chinese banks to introduce new energy efficiency
financing. IFC has also introduced market-based waste-to-energy, wind and hydropower, and water
treatment models.
WBG's support for the energy sector has focused on renewables, energy efficiency and low carbon
cities. One highlight of the WBG's support has been the China Renewable Energy Scale-Up Program
(CRESP). The first phase of the program contributed to scaling-up renewable energy by supporting
effective policy studies and the rapid growth and quality improvement of the domestic wind
manufacturing industry. IFC's China Utility-Based Energy Efficiency (CHUEE) Finance Program
also contributed by facilitating US$680 million in bank loans for US$1.4 billion in investments to
finance over 160 energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in steel, cement, glass, and other
key sectors, resulting in 17.8 million tons17 of GHG emissions avoided annually.
The WBG has been involved with the scaling up of water supply, wastewater management,
irrigation, and metropolitan service delivery, supported by AAA, GEF projects, and lending
resources. The WBG has assisted sustainable cultural and environmental heritage initiatives.
Environmental technical assistance has focused on developing the circular (recycling) economy,
green accounting, water conservation, forestry and related land tenure issues, as well as the urban
brown agenda. The Circular Economy study helped to shape the China Circular Economy Promotion
Law. It contributed to the formation and implementation of the 1 2th FYP objectives in pollution
reduction and resource-saving, and has encouraged a new generation of waste management projects.
AAA on improving water resource management in the context of worsening scarcity and on adapting

agricultural production systems to climate change has provided the analytic basis for current and
upcoming lending in water resource conservation, irrigation, and agriculture. The Adapting
Agricultural Production System to Climate Change study used cutting-edge modeling to improve
understanding about the impact of climate change on China's northern plains, its historic breadbasket.
The study, together with a successful GEF-financed pilot project in agricultural adaptation to climate
change, is shaping upcoming Bank lending to help Chinese farmers adapt to climate change.
The WBG has also analyzed and provided recommendations on land policy and the economic cost of
pollution. The Green National Accounting Study contributed significantly to the Government's
efforts to value pollution costs by introducing an economic valuation methodology and establishing
green accounting systems. The Bank also supported the promotion of strategic environmental
assessment (SEA), shared international best practices, and promoted EIA in Bank operations. WBI's
support for enhancing urban planning capacity led to improvements in training course content and
delivery methods, and a better understanding of urban environmental issues (including the
publication of the China Urban Development Quarterly).
To support China in meeting its international environmental commitments, the WBG has engaged
through AAA, lending, carbon financing, new instruments (Carbon Investment Fund), climate
partnership strategies, global funds, demonstration projects, TA, and conferences. WBG support has
succeeded in forwarding China's global environmental agenda including stabilizing GHG emissions
and phasing out of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The World Bank supported the National
Climate Change Program study adopted by the Government in 2007, which guides the direction of
China's GHG mitigation efforts and forms the basis for China's 12 th FYP climate change objectives.
Bank AAA work on the CDM under the previous CPS coupled with further policy dialogue and
major carbon investments, including the US$1.2 billion HFC23 emission reduction project, helped
confirm the viability of, and liquidity in, CDM markets worldwide. Further, the China CDM Fund
was established, a major innovation funded by a tax on CDM revenues that is now poised to invest in
climate mitigation investments across China. China now comprises 77 percent of the Bank's
substantial CDM portfolio China is also one of a handful of countries implementing the first
generation of projects under the Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF), which aims to scale up
investment in clean technology. Separately, the Bank is the largest implementing agency of GEF
funds in China, comprising about US$200 million in commitments during the CPS period. IFC
advisory products were undertaken to better understand the quality and sustainable performance of
private enterprise, carbon finance aggregation through financial institutions, and environmental and
social standards in specific industries, such as ICT.
The WBG has had limited success in piloting integrated urban planning, bulk water markets, and
liberalizing energy and water markets. The CPS could also have been more proactive in
incorporating greater WBG involvement for disaster preparedness and disaster risk management,
although the response to the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was swift and appropriate. (This response
included two projects: one large IBRD-financed earthquake recovery loan, and a second quickresponse GEF-financed project that assessed the public health risk associated with potential
earthquake damage to hazardous waste facilities.) IFC focused its attention on the broad theme of
"private sector recovery," implementing several investment and advisory services projects over the

52

past three years.1 8 Total investments amounted to US$120 million with significant advisory service
components.

Pillar 4: Financing sustained and efficient growth
Outcome Status: China continues to make strides in transforming its financial sector to a modern,
market-based system. Considerable progress was made during the CPS period in strengthening the
financial regulatory agencies and institutions, and restructuring the financial markets. The series of
policy reform measures, including capital injections by the Government, partnerships with strategic
investors, and initial public offerings, as well as enforcement of prudential regulations by the China
Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) have served to introduce modern corporate governance,
risk management and internal controls to the second-tier commercial banks. The rural financial
system has become more diverse and competitive, as the Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCCs) were
restructured and recapitalized and new rural financial institutions entered the market. However, the
financial sector reform agenda remains unfinished. According to the FSAP of 2011, the sector
remains depressed, unbalanced and costly to maintain, and the financial system is exposed to
potential risks of instability and inefficiency in resource allocation.
WBG Support: WBG engagements include lending and AAA for developing competitive rural
financial markets and housing finance (including the pilot for mortgage backed securitization),
assisting RCC reforms, promoting sustainable commercial micro and small lending, strengthening
corporate governance in state-owned banks, and studying options to improve the effectiveness of
state-ownership function in the financial sector. The WBG has also assisted in streamlining
regulations for corporate pension schemes and has facilitated the development of a strategic vision
for the capital markets. WBG analytic services have been delivered to macro-prudential authorities,
sub-national governments, and financial institutions. Engagement with the policy banks, notably
China Development Bank and Eximbank, has had a significant impact on knowledge and capacity
building, though international project-level collaboration has been less concrete. IFC investments in
national and local joint-stock banks, commercial banks (both city and rural), microfinance
companies, and TA on corporate governance, risk management, information management and
strategy development, and green energy financing have significantly contributed to the improved
development of the Chinese financial sector. The IBRD and IFC coordinated their efforts in the
financial sector within their respective mandates.
IFC is among the first foreign investors in supporting China's city commercial banks and rural
finance institutions. IFC partnered with them and with industry associations to improve corporate
governance, risk management, and commitment to expanding financing to SMEs, farmers,
manufacturers, and shop owners. IFC's work with Chinese banks included offering market-based
climate change financing solutions. Under the innovative China Utility-based Energy Efficiency
Finance program (CHUEE), IFC shoulders some of the financial risk by guaranteeing commercial
bank loans for energy efficiency projects and assisting in assessing and implementing energy
efficiency projects. IFC is now expanding the successful model of China-IFC cooperation across East
Asia, entering into similar partnerships with Vietnam, the Philippines, and Bangladesh and
facilitating South-to-South cooperation to build on China's expertise and experience.

1 IFC projects included: Koyo Fertilizer, Chengdu Small Enterprises Credit Guarantee Company (Chengdu CGC),
Beichuan Village and Township Bank (VTB), Renshou VTB, and Deyang City Commercial Bank.

53

IFC has been a key player in strengthening the financial sector with innovative investments and TA.
Some examples include: (i) helping to set up a nation-wide credit reporting system that covers 792
million individuals and 17.9 million legal entities, with cumulative number of inquires reaching 812
million by end-2010 and the system supporting lending of about US$1.4 trillion per year; (ii)
becoming one of China's largest rural finance investors with around 10 investments including the
first foreign-invested rural commercial bank, the first foreign-invested micro-credit company, the
first Sino-foreign joint venture village bank, and the first NGO transformation company; (iii) helping
to establish the movable-asset secured-financing industry in China, benefiting SMEs with cumulative
loans worth US$3.5 trillion secured by accounts receivable (one of the most important movable
assets) over a period of nearly four years; over US$1 trillion in these loans were specifically for
SMEs; and (iv) supporting the opening up of the capital market through issuing Panda Bond, Dim
Sum Bond, and signing RMB SWAP agreement with China Development Bank and China EXIM
Bank.
Going forward, partnership with key agencies at both the central and local government levels as well
as with key financial and non-financial institutions should continue. Synergies with the objectives of
Pillar 1 could have been stronger and this should be considered in the new CPS. To this end, given
the vast and growing demand for services such as MSME finance, innovative models such as the
proposed China Academy of Inclusive Finance, might play a key role in scaling up commercially
sustainable access to finance.
Pillar 5: Strengthening public and market institutions
Outcome Status: China continued to make good progress towards a market-based, sustainable
economy. The Government was committed to helping the private sector succeed and undertook
administrative reforms to advance the transition. The process of diversifying and corporatizing StateOwned Enterprises (SOE) through the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration
Commission (SASAC) is contributing to market-enhancing reforms. Competitive cultures are further
strengthened through Economic Value-Added (EVA)-based performance evaluations, and the reform
of SOE dividend policy. There are widespread initiatives to improve the investment climate.
WBG Support: The WBG's AAA and policy dialogue supported ongoing SOE reform efforts,
including reform of EVA performance evaluation; policy notes on disclosure and dividend policies;
the creation of SASAC; and a 120-city Investment Climate Assessment. Efforts by central and local
officials to strengthen the climate for investment and private sector activities also benefitted from
support by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) and MIGA, with a focus on the Central
and Western regions. The WBG contributed to the development of the Independent Power Provider
(IPP) strategy tested in the Western provinces and rolled out in the North-East. A Bank IDF grant
supports the Ministry of Finance Treasury Department's efforts to enhance the transparency,
efficiency, and effectiveness of budget execution for special purpose transfer payments. WBI's
training programs supported enhanced capacity and understanding in key areas of public finance
(budget and expenditure management, accountability, and fiscal decentralization). IFC Advisory
Services provided capacity building and best practices advice to officials at the Credit Information
System Bureau (CISB). IFC advised the government to draft and pass a new section of the Property
Law which paved the way for millions of SMEs to get banks loans by using movable assets as
collateral. IFC's work informed the development of the regulatory framework for China's credit
reporting system which has provided financial institutions in China with a fast and cost effective way
to search for the creditworthiness of credit applicants. IFC also supported the SOE
54

reorganization/privatization by investing at the project level as well as in asset management
companies.
IV.

WBG Performance

Lending: The CPS envisaged IBRD lending of about US$1.0-1.5 billion and 10-12 new projects per
year over the CPS period. The actual lending program realized CPS plans consistently (Attachment
2). The program also responded to urgent client needs (e.g., US$700 million emergency
reconstruction loan approved in the wake of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake). Support to the
poorer/lagging regions was emphasized. Many projects piloted new models. Towards the end of the
CPS period, there was an increase in the use of additional financing.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA): AAA was identified throughout the CPS period based
on emerging needs and priorities (Attachment 3). The Quarterly Economic Reports have international
readership. A number of Bank staff and managers have added blogging and other web-based
knowledge dissemination to the China AAA menu, and Bank sectoral teams and WBI have
collaborated on design and delivery of distance learning courses based on China-specific and
regional analytical work. Provincial level work on rural-urban integration in Chongqing and
Guangdong provinces has generated interest among central and local authorities and stakeholders.
Education AAA had a significant impact on shaping the government's longer term strategy. Studies
on water resource management and adapting agricultural production to climate change (combined
with experience gained from GEF pilot programs) are shaping upcoming lending projects, while
Bank AAA helped shape the 2008 national recycling law. The WBG has also provided analytical and
advisory services in renewable energy for China, including reports on large-scale wind power,
biomass power generation, and policy notes on future directions in renewable energy and energy
efficiency for China's 12 th Five-Year-Plan (2011-2015). The non-communicable disease study has
identified priority areas for health sector engagement going forward. The WBG and the Chinese
authorities have also jointly undertaken a forward-looking analytical effort that looks at China's
development and growth path over the medium to longer term - China 2030: Building a Modern,
Harmonious, and Creative High Income Society. This compendium of work lays the framework for
the WBG-China analytical engagement over the coming years. While WBG non-lending services and
research findings have been valued, there is room for improvement in the dissemination process to
broaden impact, and strengthened partnerships with Chinese institutions, counterparts, academics,
and researchers can be also encouraged. A lesson for the WBG is to ensure better outreach and
dissemination for pilot initiatives (as was done in the case of rural and national pension policy).
IFC: IFC's program in China supported the WBG's five thematic pillars in the 2006-2010 CPS with
a focus on (i) climate change, (ii) balanced rural-urban growth, and (iii) sustainable South-South
development. IFC contributed to 14 of the 35 relevant CPS outcome areas identified in the CPSPR
and in five other CPS outcome areas with no expected IFC interventions at the outset. Development
outcomes of IFC investment operations consistently improved during the period, surpassing IFC's
average in FY11. Steady improvement in DOTS indicators can be linked to the quality of project
supervision during the period, which was satisfactory in 96 percent of projects evaluated between
2006 and 2010.
IFC's work on climate change aimed to demonstrate market-based approaches to reduce the
economy's energy intensity and increase efficient use of water resources, with a focus on energy
efficiency, renewable energy, water management, and green finance. IFC also focused on balanced
55

rural-urban growth by, among others, helping reduce the gap between living standards in urban and
frontier/rural areas, principally through investments and advisory work in micro and SME finance,
rural finance agribusiness, infrastructure, food safety, manufacturing, and healthcare. IFC's SouthSouth interventions included working with Chinese companies and banks to see that Chinese
investments abroad are done in accordance with international best practice in environmental and
social standards, which will make Chinese projects more sustainable and in the long run more
profitable. These initiatives mobilized Chinese resources and helped Chinese companies contribute
sustainably to global economic development.
IFC Advisory services operations were marked by success in access to finance initiatives, including
the multi-year Secured Transactions advisory. IFC has been deeply involved in providing Advisory
Services starting from 2002 and has undertaken up to 54 projects, 30 of which support enhancing
access to finance. IFC quickly responded to changes in the country context. Areas of financing have
shifted over time in line with country priorities and IFC has started to streamline its focus towards
high impact initiatives in rural growth, climate change, and China's global engagement.
MIGA: The CPS projected that MIGA guarantee coverage would remain at about US$50 million per
year. MIGA has been active in supporting FDI into China and its current portfolio consists of 10
projects totaling US$242 million in guarantee coverage. The vast majority of projects supported are
in the infrastructure sector (96 percent), with the remaining 4 percent in services and manufacturing.
MIGA (along with FIAS) cooperates with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce in
focusing on outward investments, (especially in Africa), and with Sinosure and Eximbank and other
partners in marketing co-insurance of Chinese outward investments. MIGA also provided TA in
supporting investment promotion and benchmarking studies.
Trust Funds: The WBG mobilized US$1.4 billion in trust funds during the period in support of the
five CPS pillars. These complementary resources helped maximize the impact of WBG operations
across China. Concessional grant financing available for China has declined over time and bilateral
TFs are being phased out; however, the WBG continues to administer a significant portfolio of trust
funded activities, many from global funds. Partnerships included DFID co-financing of the Poor
Rural Communities Development Project and support for studies and knowledge sharing as well as
TF financing from Italy, the European Commission, and Netherlands. However, in the course of the
CPS period, the donor landscape changed concurrently with China's economic growth and these
partners decreased their development assistance to the country. By end-FY 11, the China trust fund
portfolio comprised 96 projects with total commitments of US$2.1 billion, with Carbon Finance,
GEF, Montreal Protocol, IDF and bilateral TFs as the major funding sources. China is a key player in
delivering on the global environmental agenda and is increasingly accessing available funds.
Completed and ongoing GEF and Montreal Protocol projects, many with IBRD co-financing, include
projects in areas such as Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out, Persistent Organic Pollutants
(POPs), global climate change (including GHG, energy conservation, renewable energy
development, and energy efficiency), biodiversity (e.g., natural reserve management, sustainable
forestry, water resource management), and land degradation. China has also received US$6.15
million from the Global Facility for Avian and Human Influenza Facility for the China HPAI and
Human Influenza Prevention and Control Capacity Building Project from 2007 to 2011. IDF grants
are important knowledge cooperation instruments which play a key role in improving capacity in
management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation.

56

CPS Implementation: The CPS results framework was used to track implementation progress;
gauge outputs, outcomes, and results; and address emerging issues and needed adjustments. In
retrospect, while this framework offered a good starting point, it proved overly complex with too
many goals, outputs, and outcomes. Measureable indicators were not developed, and assessment of
achievements are based on self evaluations. Going forward, there should be more selectivity and
specificity, with outcomes and indicators well linked to the portfolio. Supporting the CPS strategic
objectives, the WBG program emphasized demonstration projects. Analytical work linked well with
the development of new project approaches. Innovative funding instruments were used to support
China in meeting its international environmental commitments, as well as blended project financing
mixing global funds with IBRD lending. During the CPS period, the WBG made strong efforts to
simplify and streamline processes, resulting in a substantial reduction in project preparation costs as
well as a modest increase in the numbers of repeater projects, APLs, and additional financing.
Portfolio performance is one of the strongest among the large IBRD borrowers. About 97 percent of
projects were rated satisfactory or above; only 3 percent of projects evaluated by IEG in the last five
years were rated unsatisfactory/highly unsatisfactory.
V.

Key Lessons and Recommendations

*

First, the Bank Group has supported China's efforts to reduce poverty among citizens living
below the poverty line. Despite unparalleled success in moving 600 million people out of poverty
over 30 years, poverty reduction remains a fundamental challenge in China. The WBG has
supported China in introducing economic reforms that have helped to bring sustained growth and
poverty reduction, and in developing approaches to reduce inequality. Particular attention was
paid to the Western and Central provinces. Of 70 active IBRD-financed projects (February 2012),
more than 80 percent are in the poorer interior and western provinces. More than 60% of IFC's
new projects were located in frontier regions from 2009 to 2011.9

*

Second, the majority of the WBG-supported activities feature environmental objectives, many
with global implications, including a cross-cutting focus on climate change. China is essential
to global efforts to improve environmental management and address global warming. Over 80
percent of ongoing and planned Bank-financed projects include environmental objectives.

*

Third, the developing world can benefit from WBG engagement with China. China is
increasingly playing an important and influential role in the world economy and its policy
decisions have a global impact. China has a strong interest in learning more about international
experiences and best practices, a role which the WBG, as knowledge broker, is well suited to
play. There is also a growing demand from other nations to learn from China's experiences.
China is an increasingly important source of knowledge and is at the forefront of innovation in
key areas (for example, urbanization) that can help inform and motivate the development process
in other countries. WBG financing represents only a small share of China's financing and
investment needs; however, as a preeminent provider of knowledge products, best practice
experience and innovation expertise, WBG support has played a much larger role in China than
lending figures might indicate.

General lessons from the CPS implementation include:
*

*

*

*

*

*

*

Build on the strength of the WBG by ensuring that engagements maximize the entities'
respective strengths. The greatest impact and results were achieved when the WBG entities
(IBRD, IFC, MIGA, and WBI) coordinated on common objectives and each unit emphasized its
complementary strengths.
Augment the Bank's role as knowledge broker and provider. Impacts have been greatest
when WBG financed operations were grounded on solid, high quality, and client-owned AAA,
and involved intensive engagement with local counterparts. Going forward, the WBG should
continue to maximize the impact of AAA findings by strengthening dissemination.
Continue WBG support for South-South exchanges but define goals and roles of the
respective partners more clearly. (WBG, the Government of China, Chinese institutions
(Eximbank, CDB, IPRCC) and third country partners and stakeholders).
Emphasize innovation through replicable pilots. China is at the forefront of many emerging
issues (e.g., rapid urbanization) that will offer lessons for other MICs. Future WBG-supported
programs should continue to be innovative, cutting-edge, bold experimental initiatives.
Calibrate WBG engagement in the social sectors to support China in addressing emerging
issues. These not only involve social equity, but are critical to achieving a more productive
economy and a sustainable growth strategy.
Continue to reduce the transaction costs of operational engagements. The WBG has
intensified training for counterparts, and enhanced its field presence in safeguards, procurement
and financial management. Several recent additional financing operations are proving an
effective vehicle to reduce transaction costs.
Integrating different financing sources can increase the magnitude and speed of the shift to
a sustainable energy path. Good examples of the value of integrated financing include the
CRESP program and Energy Conservation I & II which fully blended IBRD and GEF resources.
Under the programs grants from GEF and other donors are used to set up an enabling
environment, introduce international experience, provide technical assistance, and build capacity,
while IBRD funds are used to demonstrate innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy
investments.

Annex 4: Country Partnership Strategy Consultations
From July 3-11, 2012, the World Bank Group discussed a draft CPS document with a wide range of
government counterparts: the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National Development Reform
Commission (NDRC), 24 additional ministries and agencies, and local officials from Guangdong,
Beijing, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Gansu. Consultations were also held with
academia, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and development partners. Comments from
participants included the following:

*

Agreement with CPS themes. Participants unanimously supported the proposed CPS themes
and outcomes, noting their close alignment with China's own priorities as articulated in the 1 2 th
Five-Year Plan.
Strong demand for continued World Bank Group engagement. The consultations revealed an
ongoing high level of demand for both financial and non-financial services from both provinces
and central ministries and agencies. Participants noted the importance of pilots and demonstration
projects, and that Bank-financed projects have also helped improve project management
techniques, such as project appraisal and performance evaluation. Projects can also help promote
reforms.
Increasing importance of knowledge cooperation. Many participants pointed out that nonfinancial services will be increasingly important. They noted and agreed with the intention to
strengthen knowledge cooperation during the CPS period. Knowledge cooperation should take
place at both the provincial and national levels.
Shift to interior provinces. Participants noted that the Bank Group's increased emphasis on
central and western China and the old industrial bases in the northeast is consistent with China's
Western Region Development Strategy. Some participants pointed out that coastal provinces are
best suited to be testing grounds for innovative demonstration projects.
Need to simplify operational procedures. NDRC and provincial representatives acknowledged
some improvement in operational processes, such as shorter project preparation time, but
emphasized the need for the Bank to further simplify operational procedures to improve
efficiency and address hidden transaction costs. They called for a wider application of
streamlined processes and use of national systems. There should be better communication and
coordination regarding problem projects. Concern was expressed about the turnover of Bank
staff, noting that staff need to be familiar with the Chinese context. Ministries and agencies asked
to be better informed about projects at the provincial level.
Give more attention to dissemination. Many participants highlighted the importance of
disseminating the findings of projects and studies. The annual Innovation Workshops are thought
provoking. Provincial finance bureaus noted that they could play a role in disseminating within
provinces. Line ministries noted that they could help disseminate project experiences if they are
kept better informed.

Consultations were also held in July 2010 in Beijing, Kunming, and Hangzhou with central line
ministries (except NDRC) and provincial finance bureaus to discuss the impact of the 2006 CPS and
provide early input for the new CPS.
