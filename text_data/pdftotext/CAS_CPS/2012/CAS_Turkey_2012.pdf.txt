2. Executive Summary
i. This review examines the implementation of the 2008-2011 Turkey Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY10 and evaluates the CPSCR. The CPS was a
joint strategy between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA and this review covers their joint program.
ii. The WBG strategy objectives were organized around three pillars. Under Pillar 1, the strategy
sought to support competitiveness and employment opportunities, which involved: sustained
macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; increased private investment, export
competitiveness, and a deeper and broader financial sector; increased employment; and reliable and
efficient energy supply. Under Pillar 2 the WBG was to support equitable human and social
development, through increasing effectiveness of social security, making the health system more
effective, enhancing the educational system and increasing sensitivity to demand for labor. Under
Pillar 3 the WBG aimed at supporting an efficient provision of high quality public services, through
rationalized and well-structured public expenditures, strengthened public sector governance, and
improved local service delivery and disaster preparedness. The strategy objectives were confirmed in
the CPSPR, with greater emphasis on growth and employment.
iii. IEG rates overall outcome of the WBG strategy as moderately satisfactory. IEG welcomes
Turkey’s achievements in palliating the impact of the global financial crisis, making information
available to the public on the budget, and the reform of the legal framework for disaster preparedness
and management. With WBG support Turkey has a more reliable and efficient energy supply, by
increasing power generation substantially, diversifying towards cleaner and renewable sources, and
promoting a more efficient use of energy through tariffs. Turkey’s equity of pensions has improved to
the extent that pension parameters were unified across new civil servants, employees, and the selfemployed. Health indicators point towards a more effective health system, and coverage of health
insurance has increased. Primary education is nearly universal, secondary enrollment and graduation
have increased, educational quality improved according to PISA scores. Turkey has improved public
financial management in some respects, especially through the reform of the Turkish Court of
Accounts. Cadastre is improving, but remains in a pilot stage in many respects. The private sector is
more involved in local service delivery, and the Istanbul Province is progressing in seismic
strengthening. IEG shares the IMF’s concern with the sharp increase in credit to the private sector
financed by external inflows channeled through the banking system, and its link with the deterioration
of the external current account. While directing WBG financial resources to provide credit to the private
sector was a positive step until mid-2009, the subsequent efforts, about US$2 billion, contributed to a
troublesome credit bubble. Available information shows that little progress was made on reducing
poverty and income inequality, as well as in enhancing the sensitivity of education to the labor
demand. The Government of Turkey did not share the WBG’s views on the need for medium-term
fiscal responsibility framework. Key legal reforms necessary for the reform of the judicial system have
yet to be adopted, especially the creation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Work on public

financial management at the municipal level is at an early stage. The CPSCR contains no information
on important issues, such as results on social inclusion, and some aspects of public financial
management. IEG notes that some of the objectives of the strategy were outside the WBG’s ability to
influence, and that, in other cases, the WBG’s strategy had no interventions that could have had a
bearing on the objectives. IEG does not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG’s strategy
those that were achieved by Turkey without the support of WBG interventions.
iv. IEG concurs with CPSCR view on the importance of policy dialogue and the need for attention to
M&E by the country and the WBG to achieve objectives, as well as on the importance of a long-term
commitment to achieve structural results. IEG notes two additional lessons from this review. First, for
the WBG to be successful in development effectiveness, its objectives need to be backed by
interventions capable of contributing to those objectives. Strategy objectives that are achieved by the
country and are beyond the area of influence of the WBG do not demonstrate the WBG’s development
effectiveness. Second, the case of Turkey underscores the reasons why the WBG could enhance its
development effectiveness by framing its interventions on a sound understanding of the
macroeconomic situation and policies of the country. Providing credit flows to the private sector at a
time when it is receiving unusually high external flows takes away from the WBG intervention’s
development effectiveness by contributing to weakening the country’s external and financial position.

3. WBG Strategy Summary
Overview of CPS Relevance:
Country Context
1. Having recovered dramatically from its 2001 financial crisis, Turkey was in a strong position at
the start of the CPS: GDP growth averaged nearly 7 percent per year in 2002-2007, inflation was
lowered to single digits, public finances, public debt indicators, and financial sector stability had
improved substantially, and poverty had also declined. In 2008, Turkey successfully completed an
IMF stand-by arrangement. It also continued its EU aquis procedure, which it had begun in 2001.
This context changed sharply with the 2008 global financial crisis. As a result of reduced exports and
capital flows, GDP fell 4.8 percent in 2009 while unemployment rose from 10.3 percent in 2007 to
14.0 percent in early 2009. Turkey responded with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, while
capital inflows surged since mid-2009. GDP growth reached 9.0 percent in 2010 and an estimated
7.5 percent in 2011, and unemployment declined to 11.9 percent in 2010. The external current
account, however, worsened in 2010 and reached 10.2 percent of GDP in 2011, up from levels of
around 6.0 percent in 2006-07. The large capital inflows channeled through the banking system led
to a monetary expansion, increased imports and higher inflation. Meanwhile the structural primary
fiscal balance has swung from a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to an estimated deficit of 1.1
percent of GDP in 2011.. Aside from the external imbalance, Turkey still faces challenges in
employment, poverty reduction, social service provision, energy supply, and the stability of its
financial sector. In addition, Turkey is often hit by major earthquakes.
2. Turkey’s vision in its 2007-2013 Development Plan was to move toward “a country with an
information society, growing in stability, sharing more equitably, globally competitive and fully
completed her coherence with the European Union.” More specifically, its development objectives
were: “increasing competitiveness, increasing employment, strengthening human development and
social solidarity, ensuring regional development, and increasing the quality and effectiveness of
public services”, backed by continued macroeconomic stability.

Objectives of the WBG Strategy:
3. The WBG strategy objectives were organized around three pillars. Under Pillar 1, the strategy
sought to support competitiveness and employment opportunities, which involved: sustained
macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; increased private investment, export
competitiveness, and a deeper and broader financial sector; increased employment; and reliable and
efficient energy supply. Under Pillar 2 the WBG was to support equitable human and social
development, through increasing effectiveness of social security, making the health system more
effective, enhancing the educational system and increasing sensitivity to demand for labor. Under
Pillar 3 the WBG aimed at supporting an efficient provision of high quality public services, through
rationalized and well-structured public expenditures, strengthened public sector governance, and
improved local service delivery and disaster preparedness. The strategy objectives were confirmed in
the CPSPR, with greater emphasis on growth and employment.
Relevance of the WBG Strategy:
4. Congruence with the country’s context and program: The WBG strategy was aligned with
Turkey’s own development strategy. The three pillars matched the government’s major development
objectives, and supported Turkey’s long-term development goals. The WBG adapted its strategy at
the time of the CPSPR aiming to help Turkey face the global financial crisis. While targeting the longrun challenges of Turkey’s economy, the strategy failed to recognize and adjust to the deterioration in
the external balance during the last two years of the strategy. Only IFC in its last two operations
mentioned the external balance issue. In addition, although the CPS mentioned governance as a key
priority for Turkey in the medium term, the strategy did not address the Governance and AntiCorruption (GAC) agenda of the WBG beyond some steps in public financial management, a reform
of the cadastre system and advice on judicial reform.
5. Relevance of Design: The WBG strategy was weakly relevant from the standpoint of its design.
Some objectives were not supported by WBG interventions and the link between outcomes and
interventions was weak in others. While the strategy validly cautioned that the WBG is a small player
in Turkey, it went on to set up objectives that were too far from or out of the area of influence of its
interventions. The scope for playing a catalytic role was absent in these cases. For example,
objectives such as macroeconomic stability on its monetary and exchange rate components and
most of the fiscal components could not have been influenced by any of the interventions of the
strategy. In other cases, such as the revamping of public financial management at the municipal
level, the objectives were too ambitious. The monitoring and evaluation framework of the strategy
was weak in many areas, including expected outcomes for which there is no information or, if it
exists, was not tracked. For example, there is an outcome indicator on the “efficiency and economic
life of existing public capital stock” for which the information available is on central government
expenditures on maintenance and repair. These shortcomings limit the use of the results framework
for the WBG’s monitoring and evaluation.
6. Relevance of IFC’s and MIGA’s strategies: During the CPS, IFC focused on support for
Turkey to become more competitive, improve its infrastructure, improve the quality of health and
education, and reduce regional inequalities. This was consistent with the government strategy, IFC’s
strategic focus areas, and the CPS objectives. All IFC investments responded to market conditions,
filling the financing voids and offering products and services that often were not easily available
commercially. Longer tenor, higher environmental and social standards, and better corporate
governance that were embodied in IFC investments, as well as IFC’s global knowledge were the key
value-added. In the CPSPR, IFC adjusted its strategy in response to the crisis to emphasize
restructuring and recapitalization for existing clients. However, it was only in the last two operations
that IFC acknowledged the deterioration of Turkey’s external balance. MIGA’s program focused on
supporting foreign direct investment (FDI) in infrastructure, energy, and finance. The global crisis

CPSCR Review

slowed FDI to Turkey and weakened the demand for MIGA guarantees.
7. Risk Identification and Mitigation: The CPS and CPSPR identified as major risks a sharp
slowdown in capital inflows, and Turkey’s vulnerability to natural disasters. The CPSPR also
identified the uncertainties over slow global recovery and higher global energy prices. The strategy
did not have specific mitigating measures, as it considered that Turkey’s strong macroeconomic
performance, its large international reserves, its reforms in the financial sector after its 2001 crisis,
and increased energy efficiency and diversification were sufficient to mitigate these risks. Longer-run,
sound economic management was viewed as the only means for Turkey to weather global economic
risks. The risk that was not foreseen in the strategy and materialized beginning in mid-2009 was a
marked increase in capital inflows, which were channeled by the banking system and fostered an
increase in the demand for imports.
Overview of CPS Implementation:
Lending and Investments:
8. IBRD approved 17 loans totaling US$7.6 billion during the 2008-2011 CPS. By 2011, Turkey
had become IBRD’s second largest borrower, with $12.9 billion outstanding. Twenty-one loans were
originally projected in the CPS and seventeen delivered, including two for additional funding of ongoing projects. Total actual lending during the CPS was US$7.6 billion, twenty-three percent more
than projected in the CPS. Six development policy loans (DPLs) accounted for $4.4 billion, nearly 60
percent of lending; six financial intermediation loans (FILs), including additional funding for existing
loans for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and export finance, accounted for $1.85 billion, about
30 percent. During the CPSPR lending was US$4.4 billion, 67 percent larger than projected in the
CPS. The CPSPR lending increase mainly reflected two programmatic DPLs, Restoring Economic
Growth and Employment (REGE I and REGE II), and three FILs for SME and export finance. Other
CPSPR period loans were a second programmatic DPL for Energy Efficiency and Environment, a
sixth energy investment loan, and additional funding for both the Municipal Services loan and the
successful Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness loan.
9. IBRD portfolio has improved following the deterioration in the years of the global financial crisis.
Projects at risk (the same as problem projects) were brought down to about 6 percent in FY11 after
rising to 13.6 percent in 2008 and over 20 percent in FY2010. The government and the IBRD have
agreed to take action promptly to maintain good portfolio performance and drop or restructure
projects when appropriate. Of the lending exiting during the CPS period and evaluated by IEG, 92
percent received a rating of moderately satisfactory or better, a share greater than the average for
the World Bank of 74 percent or of ECA of 81 percent.
10. Turkey is now IFC’s fourth largest client. During the CPS, IFC committed nearly $1.8 billion in 34
loans, $100 million in four equity investments (one mixed loan-equity), and $75 million through the
Global Trade Finance Program. This was at the upper bound of $1.6-2.0 billion anticipated for the
CPS. IFC’s program was front-loaded, with 36 percent committed in FY08. Funding slowed in FY09
and FY10, partly reflecting the shock from the global crisis and the need to provide restructuring
services to existing clients. By FY11, however, IFC investments in Turkey started growing again and
a majority of them (63%) was invested in Greenfield projects. Most of IFC commitments were loans,
while equity investment fell by 71% compared to the previous CPS. By the end of the CPS, loans
accounted for 95 percent of the IFC portfolio. The financial system continued to account for much of
IFC’s new commitments (39 percent), but infrastructure commitments rose significantly, especially in
power, from zero to 30 percent of total commitments, and transport, which grew 13-fold. IFC’s crisis
response in Turkey also led to a marked shift of focus from real sector to financial sector: 64 percent
of FM investments during the CPS took place in FY10-11, compared to 14 percent for MAS
investments.

11. IFC had 63 active projects in its portfolio at the end of FY11, including 36 new projects initiated
during the CPS period and 27 projects that remained active from the 70 in the portfolio at the end of
FY07. Twelve IFC investment projects were evaluated by IEG during the CPS period. Of these, six
were rated successful, five mostly successful, and one mostly unsuccessful.
12. MIGA is providing five guarantees to foreign investors in Turkey. Four were made during the
CPS: one in finance in FY08, one in infrastructure in FY10, and two in infrastructure in FY11. Total
exposure in the five guarantees is about US$1.5 billion. In FY11, MIGA used a new product,
providing a US$409 million guarantee to Istanbul Municipality (sub-national) for the Istanbul metro.
Analytic and Advisory Activities and Services:
13. IBRD delivered 11 to 16 AAA products annually during the CPS; including some non-lending TA.
The products generally coincided with the planned AAA. The AAA supported lending in the 3 pillars of
the strategy. The AAA in Pillar 1 included a country economic memorandum (CEM) and studies on
employment, labor market policy, energy and energy markets. In Pillar 2, AAA analyzed social
security, social insurance, education and equity, and welfare and social policy. In Pillar 3, AAA
included tasks on public expenditure and financial management, municipal finance and services, and
the judicial system.
14. IFC had a negligible portfolio of advisory services in Turkey during the CPS. Three projects (two
Sustainable Business Advisories and one Public Private Partnership) were started before the CPS,
with two of them closing in FY08. Of three new advisory projects that were developed during the
CPS, one was dropped and the other two are still at the concept development stage.
Partnerships and Development Partner Coordination:
15. WBG’s development partners in Turkey include the IMF; the UN; the EU; the EBRD; the EIB;
bilateral lenders such as DIFID and KfW, and a number of civil society organizations. Turkey
successfully completed an IMF stand-by in May 2008, and decided to move forward without an IMF
program at the time of the financial crisis. Collaboration between the WBG and the IMF in the crisis
period was low, with the IMF advocating for more guarded macroeconomic policies. The WBG’s
collaborated with many development partners (e.g. the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
EBRD, Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, FMO, KfW) in private sector development and
climate change areas, and played a convening role among the civil society partners in designing and
implementing social sector projects. Many WBG interventions (both lending and AAA) were intended
to support Turkey in reforms consistent with EU aquis; EU negotiations, however, are progressing at
a slow pace.
Safeguards and Fiduciary Issues:
16. IEG is not aware of any investigations regarding safeguards or fiduciary issues in WBG
interventions in Turkey.

Overview of Achievement by Objective:
17. The WBG’s strategy objectives were organized around three pillars, focusing on
competitiveness and employment opportunities, equitable human and social development, and the
efficient provision of high quality public services. At the time of the CPSPR the strategy placed more
emphasis on growth, employment, and financing for the private sector by IBRD and IFC, to support
Turkey’s recovery from the crisis.

Pillar 1: Competitiveness and Employment Opportunities
18. Under Pillar 1, the WBG sought to support Turkey on sustaining macroeconomic stability and
economic growth; increasing private investment, improving export competitiveness, and fostering a
deeper and broader financial sector, increasing employment, and ensuring a reliable and efficient
energy supply.
19. Sustaining macroeconomic stability and economic growth. Turkey’s economic growth has
averaged 1.7 percent in real terms during the CPS period, having fluctuated significantly with the
global financial crisis. Initially, the crisis brought about a decline in exports and capital inflows, as well
as a fall in GDP of 4.8 percent in 2009. In response, Turkey eased monetary and fiscal policy, and
European markets responded favorably by purchasing US$3.75 billion of Turkish external
government bonds in 2009. While Turkey’s GDP rebounded by 9 percent in 2010 and unemployment
declined, the external current account deficit has risen from around 6 percent of GDP at the
beginning of the CPS period to over 10 percent in 2011. The IMF is concerned with the external
deterioration, noting that Turkey’s resilience has been weakened by what it labels the “recent
unbalanced growth episode,” and calling for the country to revisit its macroeconomic policies.
20. The WBG supported Turkey with the Public Sector Programmatic DPL (FY08) before the global
financial crisis, as well as with the Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Programmatic DPL,
REGE, (FY10) in its wake. In addition, IBRD had two pieces of AAA, one on sustaining high growth
and the other one on savings and sustained growth. The extent to which WBG interventions may
have influenced Turkey’s macroeconomic policy approach to the crisis and the recovery is unclear.
21. Increasing private investment, improving export competitiveness, and fostering a deeper
and broader financial sector. Real private investment, which had grown by about 30 percent per
year until 2004, gradually slowed to reach 2.6 percent in 2007 and minus 22.5 percent in 2009 at the
peak of the global financial crisis. The rate of growth rebounded since and is estimated to have
reached about 30 percent per year in 2010-11. Foreign direct investment (FDI), however, was
US$4.5 billion a year less in 2011 than at the beginning of the CPS period. Exports, which dropped
with the global financial crisis, recovered gradually reaching in 2011 the level that they had in 2008 of
just over 23 percent of GDP. The Global Economic Forum competitiveness index rating for Turkey
showed little improvement during the CPS period, increasing from 4.25 over 7.00 in 2008/09 to 4.28
in 2011/12. The limited improvement reflects the longer-term issues in education, health, efficiency of
public institutions, and, especially, the labor market. Private sector credit from banks grew from 27
percent of GDP in 2007 to 48 percent in 2011, driven by a surge in capital inflows since mid-2009.
These flows were intermediated by the Turkish financial sector. SME loans also grew, though not as
fast as the aggregate. The IMF has expressed concerns about the stability of these external flows
and has advocated for Turkey to have a macroeconomic policy stance that allows an eventual soft
landing when the flows are reversed. On the legislative side, Turkey enacted a new Commercial
Code in line with the EU aquis, and enhanced the government credit guarantee program.
22. IBRD supported these objectives with the REGE Programmatic series (FY10 and FY11). IBRD
made financial intermediary loans (FILs) through banks to SMEs and exporters that disbursed
quickly. IBRD also provided support through several pieces of AAA, covering a broad range of topics.
IFC provided equity, loans, and trade finance to local banks, as well as direct loans to 7 companies,
mostly 2nd tier companies and energy regional players. IFC also invested in transport logistics. MIGA
provided guarantees to support finance of the Istanbul metro.
23. Increasing employment. The employment picture fluctuated strongly with the global financial
crisis. Starting from a level of 10.3 percent in 2007, the unemployment rate increase to 14.0 percent
in 2009 and has declined 9.8 percent in 2011. The improvement in employment reflects the rebound
in economic activity, as well as improved support for short-term employment and vocational training.
It also has happened at a time when the share of the labor force increased from 41.5 percent of the

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

For Official Use Only
7

population in 2007 to 43.0 percent in 2010. To improve labor market flexibility, the government
allowed more flexible contracting under a 2011 law and improved targeting of subsidies for new hires.
24. IBRD provided support on employment policies through REGE I (FY10) and REGE II (FY11), as
well as AAA.
25. Reliable and Efficient Energy Supply. Electric power generation increased by 20 percent
between 2006 and 2010, with a higher share of energy being produced by hydro, gas and wind
sources. As part of the revision of the regulatory framework, a tariff reform increased the passthrough of electricity costs to consumers in 2008. However, power distribution losses ended the CPS
period above the 2006 level, 18.6 percent in 2010, up from 15.1 percent in 2006, reflecting losses in
the remaining public sector distribution companies. While power distribution in private hands
increased from 3 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2010, the share of private generation remained at
the same 2006 level of 55 percent. On the sustainability side, Turkey became a signatory of the
Kyoto Protocol in 2009 and established a framework for renewable energy.
26. IBRD provided support through an Energy Supply Security of South East Europe APLs II and III
(FY05-11), a Gas Sector Development Project (FY 06), an Electricity Distribution and Rehabilitation
Project (FY07), a Programmatic Electricity Sector DPL (FY08), a Private Sector Renewable Energy
and Energy Efficiency Project (FY09, a FIL), a Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and
Energy Sector DPL (FY10). IBRD provided support through AAA on energy market development and
energy efficiency. IFC made loans to and mobilized other resources for the energy sector in five
projects, including small-scale hydro-plants and wind farms. Three loans to local banks and several
investments to Turkish companies targeted energy efficiency upgrades. IBRD and IFC were also
involved in a Clean Technology Fund using trust fund resources.
27. IEG rates the achievement of outcomes under Pillar 1 as moderately satisfactory. Turkey
moved swiftly to palliate the impact of the global financial crisis and the WBG provided useful
financial support at the time of the crisis. Also with WBG support, Turkey has a more reliable and
efficient energy supply, by increasing power generation substantially, diversifying towards cleaner
and renewable sources, and promoting a more efficient use of energy through tariffs. IEG shares the
IMF’s concern with the sharp increase in credit to the private sector financed by external inflows
channeled through the banking system, and its link with the deterioration of the external current
account. While directing WBG financial resources to provide credit to the private sector was a positive
step until mid-2009, the subsequent efforts, about US$2 billion, contributed to a troublesome credit
bubble. IEG notes that some of the objectives on macroeconomic policy were outside the WBG’s
purview and capacity to influence, namely monetary and exchange rate policy. In addition, the
WBG’s strategy had no interventions that could have had a tangible influence or play a catalytic role
on defining Turkey’s fiscal policy. IEG does not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG’s
strategy those that were achieved by Turkey without the support of WBG interventions.
Pillar 2: Equitable Human and Social Development
28. The WBG strategy under Pillar 2 sought to support Turkey in increasing the effectiveness of the
social security system, while improving income distribution, social inclusion and the fight against
poverty; making the health system more effective; and enhancing the educational system and
increasing the sensitivity of education to labor demand.
29. Increasing the effectiveness of the social security system, while improving income
distribution, social inclusion and the fight against poverty. The poverty rate in Turkey has
remained around 18 percent through the CPS period, as has the Gini coefficient which stayed around
0.4. Implementation of the 2006 social security and universal health insurance law and its 2008
amendment are reported to have made the social security system more effective. There is no data on
the impact of the reform on the long-term fiscal balance of the pension system, but it is also expected

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

8

to be on the positive side. The reform improved the equity of pensions by unifying pension
parameters across new civil servants, employees, and the self-employed. The government also
created a new ministry that unified social benefits management and information on social benefits. At
a lower level, Turkey continued work on the rehabilitation of the Anatolia Watershed, which benefits
small farmers.
30. The WBG supported Turkey through the REGE I and II DPLs, the Second Programmatic Public
Sector Development Policy Loan, the Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project (FY04), and AAA on
social security and health insurance reform.
31. Making the health system more effective. Overall, maternal mortality fell from 28.5 deaths per
100 thousand in 2005 to 16.4 in 2010, while infant mortality declined from 18.0 per thousand in 2007
to 13.7. However, the occupancy rate of hospitals remains at 63 percent, with the CPS’s expected
increase not taking place. Public spending on preventive and primary health care services increased
by less than expected in the CPS, from 25 percent of total public spending to 27 percent (against a
targeted 30 percent). This increase helped finance the extension of family and community health
services to the entire country. Under the reform of the social security and universal health insurance
system mentioned above, health insurance coverage increased from 86 percent in 2005 to 96
percent in 2010, as a result of obligatory insurance and targeted government programs for the poor.
32. These outcomes reflect the government’s Health Transformation Program, which was supported
by IBRD’s Health Sector Transition APL (FY04), the Avian Influenza APL (FY06) the Health
Transformation and Social Security Reform APL (FY09) and AAA. IFC made two investments in
health care, including equity in a large, distressed provider and a loan to a leasing firm that financed
SME health providers.
33. Enhancing the educational system and increasing the sensitivity of education to labor
demand. Primary education is nearly universal, secondary enrollment has increased from 57 percent
to 69 percent during the CPS period, and graduation rates from 45 to 51 percent. In addition,
educational quality improved according to PISA scores (average reading score rose from 447 in 2006
to 464 in 2009—the latest available year, math from 424 to 445, and science from 424 to 454). As for
the sensitivity of education to labor demand, the government expanded vocational training in
response to the crisis, and adopted a new secondary education curriculum for four main subjects.
The extent of its alignment to the labor demand is not known.
34. The WBG supported Turkey in this efforts through the Basic Education APL (FY03), the
Secondary Education Project (FY 05, still active), and AAA activities on secondary education and
vocational training.
35. IEG rates the achievement of outcomes under Pillar 2 as satisfactory. With support from the
WBG, Turkey’s equity of pensions has improved to the extent that pension parameters were unified
across new civil servants, employees, and the self-employed. Health indicators point towards a more
effective health system, and coverage of health insurance has increased. Primary education is nearly
universal, secondary enrollment and graduation have increased, educational quality improved
according to PISA scores. Available information shows that little progress was made on reducing
poverty and income inequality, as well as in enhancing the sensitivity of education to the labor
demand. There is no information on results in social inclusion.

Pillar 3: Efficient Provision of High Quality Public Services
36. Under Pillar 3 the CPS aimed at supporting Turkey at rationalizing and improving the structure
of the public expenditure management system; strengthening public sector governance; and

CPSCR Review
Independent Evaluation Group

9

improving local service delivery and disaster preparedness.
37. Rationalizing and improving the structure of the public expenditure management system.
The WBG’s strategy was to contribute to Turkey’s efforts to strengthen public administration and
governance, and improve service delivery and social protection within a framework of sustained
growth. At the time of the CPSPR the focus narrowed to defining a medium-term fiscal responsibility
framework, strengthening financial controls, enhancing monitoring and evaluation, harmonizing the
external audit framework with the new PFM structure, enhancing Parliamentary oversight, and a
revised mandate for the Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA). The Government of Turkey did not share
the WBG’s views on the need for medium-term fiscal responsibility framework. The International
Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Index shows Turkey’s overall score improving from 43 over 100 in
2008 to 57 in 2010, reflecting the move by the government to publish the budget information,
including the audit report. The Court of Accounts was given a wider mandate to audit all government
entities under the 2010 Turkish Court of Accounts Law. The CPSCR provides no information on
progress on the other revised objectives mentioned above.
38. IBRD provided support through the Second Programmatic Public Sector Development Loan
(FY08), and AAA on public financial management, municipal and regional development,
parliamentary oversight and the Courts of Accounts.
39. Strengthening public sector governance. The WBG strategy focused on helping Turkey
improve its cadastre and the judiciary system. In the area of the cadastre Turkey has made progress
on reviewing parcels and developing maps, as well as establishing a pilot office and some pilot
programs. These programs have helped reduce the number of cadastre disputes in courts from 4.0
percent of properties covered by the programs to 2.5 percent. Turkey’s progress on the judicial
system seems mixed, judging by the World Economic Forum indicators for efficiency of the legal
framework and judicial independence. The indicator for efficiency, which measures perceptions on
the private business ability to settle disputes and challenge the legality of actions, improved from 3.3
over 7.0 in 2007/08 to 3.7 in 2010/11. For the same period, the indicator for judicial independence
came down from 4.0 over 7.0 to 3.3. The CPSCR provides no information on the outcomes that the
WBG expected to see on the quality of judging process, improving legal and institutional structures,
the establishment of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism or the acceleration of judicial
processes. What is known is that all courts now have on-line connections, and that the legal changes
that were needed to bring about the results expected by the WBG have not taken place yet.
40. IBRD provided support through the Land Registry and Cadastre Modernization Project (FY08),
as well as through technical assistance on the judicial system and its reform.
41. Improving local service delivery and disaster preparedness. On the local service delivery
side, the WBG strategy focused on providing financial support to municipalities, fostering commercial
lending to them, and exploring PPPs at the municipal level. An important pre-condition to lending to
municipalities was to improve their public financial management. On disaster preparedness, the
strategy aimed at providing assistance to the government upon request to strengthen emergency
preparedness and disaster management. Public financial management of municipalities failed to
improve as expected. Overdue receivables of local administrations to the Treasury increased instead
of decline, while budget transfers to them increased from 9 percent of tax revenues in 2007 to 10
percent in 2010. The private sector, however, is now more involved in local service delivery in specific
aspects, such as billing and collection, meter reading and maintenance. On disaster preparedness,
the WBG assistance targeted two sub national entities to carry out some of the tasks mandated by
the reform of the legal framework on preparedness and disaster management adopted by Turkey in
2009. One of these two projects was stopped.
42. IBRD provided support through the Municipal Services Project (FY05), and, together with the
European Investment Bank, the Council of Europe Bank, to the Istanbul Province (Istanbul Seismic

Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project FY07) for work on seismic strengthening. IBRD also
provided indirect support to municipalities through the Iller Bank, which was restructured, as well as
AAA to the municipalities. IFC made a loan to the Istanbul Metro which did not have a sovereign
guarantee. MIGA guaranteed a large foreign investment in the project.
43. The IEG rates the outcome of the WBG strategy in Pillar 3 as moderately satisfactory. IEG notes
Turkey’s progress in publishing budget information, as well as the reform of the legal framework for
disaster preparedness and management. With WBG support, Turkey has improved public financial
management in some respects, especially through the reform of the Turkish Court of Accounts.
Cadastre is improving, but remains in a pilot stage in many respects. The private sector is more
involved in local service delivery, and the Istanbul Province is progressing in seismic strengthening.
The Government of Turkey did not share the WBG’s views on the need for medium-term fiscal
responsibility framework. The CPSCR does not provide information on progress on some aspects of
public financial management. Key legal reforms necessary for the reform of the judicial system have
yet to be adopted, especially the creation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Work on
public financial management at the municipal level is on its early stages. As noted in Pillar 1, IEG
does not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG’s strategy those that were achieved by
Turkey on its own.

44. Overall Outcome. IEG rates overall outcome of the WBG strategy as moderately satisfactory.
IEG welcomes Turkey’s achievements in palliating the impact of the global financial crisis, making
information available to the public on the budget, and the reform of the legal framework for disaster
preparedness and management. With WBG support Turkey has a more reliable and efficient energy
supply, by increasing power generation substantially, diversifying towards cleaner and renewable
sources, and promoting a more efficient use of energy through tariffs. Turkey’s equity of pensions has
improved to the extent that pension parameters were unified across new civil servants, employees,
and the self-employed. Health indicators point towards a more effective health system, and coverage
of health insurance has increased. Primary education is nearly universal, secondary enrollment and
graduation have increased, educational quality improved according to PISA scores. Turkey has
improved public financial management in some respects, especially through the reform of the Turkish
Court of Accounts. Cadastre is improving, but remains in a pilot stage in many respects. The private
sector is more involved in local service delivery, and the Istanbul Province is progressing in seismic
strengthening. IEG shares the IMF’s concern with the sharp increase in credit to the private sector

financed by external inflows channeled through the banking system, and its link with the deterioration
of the external current account. While directing WBG financial resources to provide credit to the
private sector was a positive step until mid-2009, the subsequent efforts, about US$2 billion,
contributed to a troublesome credit bubble. Available information shows that little progress was made
on reducing poverty and income inequality, as well as in enhancing the sensitivity of education to the
labor demand. The Government of Turkey did not share the WBG’s views on the need for mediumterm fiscal responsibility framework. Key legal reforms necessary for the reform of the judicial system
have yet to be adopted, especially the creation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Work
on public financial management at the municipal level is at an early stage. The CPSCR contains no
information on important issues, such as results on social inclusion, and some aspects of public
financial management. IEG notes that some of the objectives of the strategy were outside the WBG’s
ability to influence, and that, in other cases, the WBG’s strategy had no interventions that could have
had a bearing on the objectives. IEG does not consider as satisfactory outcomes of the WBG’s
strategy those that were achieved by Turkey without the support of WBG interventions.
45. IBRD Performance. IEG rates IBRD performance moderately satisfactory. IBRD showed
flexibility at the time of the global financial crisis. In addition, the strategy was aligned with the
government’s development plan. The strategy, however, while targeting the long-run challenges of
Turkey’s economy, failed to recognize and adjust to the deterioration in the external balance during
the last two years of the period. The relevance of design of the strategy was undermined by the
inclusion of objectives that were outside the area of influence of the interventions or over-ambitious.
The monitoring and evaluation framework of the strategy was weakened by the inclusion of outcome
indicators that were either not monitored or could not be. AAA, including non-lending TAA, effectively
supported dialogue and lending-related issues. IBRD portfolio has improved following the
deterioration in the years of the global financial crisis, thanks to a pro-active stance by the country
team in conjunction with the government. Of the lending exiting during the CPS period and evaluated
by IEG, the Turkey program received a rating of moderately satisfactory or better more often than the
average for the World Bank or ECA. Coordination with the IMF could have been fruitfully improved.
Coordination with other development partners was generally good. The country team paid adequate
attention to safeguard and fiduciary issues.
46. IFC performance. IEG rates IFC performance as satisfactory. IFC’s program was consistent
with Turkey’s development priorities, the WBG strategy and IFC’s strategic focus areas. The IFC
program adjusted in the CPSPR to new needs arising from the global financial crisis, based on
lessons from past crises. Implementation of IFC program, which complemented IBRD and MIGA
programs, was good as reflected by the positive ratings by IEG of IFC projects during the CPS. In
addition to long tenor, which became scarce during the crisis, IFC investments played a role in raising
environmental and social standards, introducing good corporate governance practices, and bringing
global knowledge to Turkey’s private sector. IFC contributions were unique in its lending to the
Istanbul Metro without a sovereign guarantee. It also contributed with its investment in the power
sector; its support of 2nd tier companies and Turkish companies investing in other developing
countries; and its focus on climate change and sustainability. IFC, however, should have been more
aware of the troublesome deterioration of Turkey’s external current account, triggered by capital
inflows and a credit bubble. It was only in the last two operations that IFC acknowledged the
deterioration of Turkey’s external balance.
47. MIGA performance. IEG rates MIGA performance as satisfactory. MIGA guarantees
responded to the market, and reflected variations in FDI. The three most recent guarantees
supported infrastructure, as expected in the CPS. In 2011, MIGA used a new product to guarantee
FDI in the Istanbul metro.

5. Assessment of CPS Completion Report
48. The CPSCR provides a concise summary of the WBG’s program. There is good coverage of the
projects that have been successfully implemented, and their outcomes. However, the CPSCR is
silent on why certain operations did not go forward, or any issues encountered during the preparation
and/or implementation of any of the projects, including at the macroeconomic level. The CPSCR
does not discuss safeguards or fiduciary issues.

6. Findings and Lessons
49. IEG concurs with CPSCR view on the importance of policy dialogue and the need for attention
to M&E by the country and the WBG to achieve objectives, as well as on the importance of a longterm commitment to achieve structural results. IEG notes two additional lessons from this review.
First, for the WBG to be successful in development effectiveness, its objectives need to be backed by
interventions capable of contributing to those objectives. Strategy objectives that are achieved by the
country and are beyond the area of influence of the WBG do not demonstrate the WBG’s
development effectiveness. Second, the case of Turkey underscores the reasons why the WBG
could enhance its development effectiveness by framing its interventions on a sound understanding
of the macroeconomic situation and policies of the country. Providing credit flows to the private sector
at a time when it is receiving unusually high external flows takes away from the WBG intervention’s
development effectiveness by contributing to weakening the country’s external and financial position.
