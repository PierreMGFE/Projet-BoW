Executive Summary
i.

Since the early 1990s Ethiopia has pursued a “developmental state” model with a strong
role for the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) in many aspects of the economy. This
approach, based on high levels of public investment, has been associated with strong
economic growth and delivered notable progress towards the attainment of many Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). During 2004-11 Ethiopia experienced strong and generally
broad-based real economic growth averaging around 10.6 percent a year; industry and the
service sector grew on average 10 percent a year, and foreign direct investment increased
from US$0.5 billion in 2007 to US$1.2 billion in 2011. The growth of goods and services
exports reached close to 10 percent annually during 2000-10, and Ethiopia made good
progress in diversifying processed exports. Significant improvements have been made in
access to and, to a lesser extent, the quality of infrastructure. The average distance to an allweather road decreased to 3.5 hours in 2011 from 4.5 hours in 2007. By 2010, the proportion
of the rural population with access to potable water had risen to 65.8 percent, from 46 percent
in 2006, with about five percent of Ethiopia’s population gaining access to improved water
every year. By 2011, 41 percent of rural towns and villages were connected to the grid and
the number of consumers connected grew from 800,000, in 2005, to more than 2 million in
2011. Going forward, the hydropower sector holds great promise for Ethiopia as a source of
investments and closer regional integration.

ii.

There has been similar progress on poverty, human development and capacity. Poverty
in both urban and rural areas has been reduced substantially from 39 percent of Ethiopians
living below the national poverty line (US$0.6 per day) in 2004/05, to less than 30 percent
six years later. Ethiopia is on track to achieve MDGs related to gender parity in primary
education, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. Good progress has been made in
increasing access to primary education (currently 85 percent coverage), but it may not be
enough to reach the MDG on universal primary education. Limited progress has been made
in reducing maternal mortality, which remains 676 per 100,000 live births. Finally, during
the past decade Ethiopia has made impressive progress in decentralizing authority and
service delivery. Capacity and institution building efforts at decentralized levels have
contributed to improved access to basic services and to more effective decision-making
bodies. There have been a series of modernization efforts across the public service, including
Public Financial Management reforms. The legislative and regulatory framework for the
business environment has undergone significant strengthening although more remains to be
done.

iii.

Notwithstanding these positive developments, important challenges have emerged
during the last few years that may require GoE to adjust some of its policies. Enabling
the country to move to a higher growth trajectory may require attention to several challenges,
including: ensuring macroeconomic stability; addressing the persistently high numbers of the
poor and food-insecure; the lagging quality of social services; and the weak capacity of the
public sector.

iv.

With the recent death of the Prime Minister, GoE needs to ensure a smooth transition
in coming months. GoE has embarked on a constitutional process of transition, has
i

confirmed that government continues to work as usual, and has expressed confidence that the
existing public institutions will continue to function normally. GoE has also confirmed its
commitment to the vision and goals stated in the GTP, which remains the centerpiece of the
country's development strategy.
v.

The development model adopted by GoE relies heavily on high levels of largely
government-led investments (like the Asian model of development), but faces low saving
rates and limited availability of domestic resources (unlike the Asian model). Given the
high investment requirements of the GTP, public investments, which in past years have been
one of the major drivers of economic growth in Ethiopia, will not be sufficient to maintain
high growth performance going forward. While private sector participation in industry and
services could greatly contribute to the Government’s export-led job creation agenda,
significantly leverage public sector financing and foster technology and knowledge transfer,
realizing this potential will require enhancing opportunities for domestic and foreign private
sector participation. There are also serious concerns that bouts of high inflation may reverse
some of these positive poverty trends and, while inflation is currently showing a decreasing
trend, keeping it down will be a major challenge for monetary policy.

vi.

Despite double-digit economic growth and substantial decreases in the percentage of the
population below the national poverty line, the absolute number of poor is almost the same as
15 years ago and a significant proportion of the population remains just above the poverty
line and vulnerable to shocks. Similarly the number of people living under the food poverty
line has increased and dependence on appeals for emergency relief remains persistently high.
Further, although access to basic social services and infrastructure has considerably
improved, the quality of those services has not kept pace. Delivering quality would require
continued efforts to deepen the implementation of decentralization and to build the capacity
of the public service, both its institutions and its human resource. Finally, continuing efforts
to promote an open and transparent environment, through, inter alia, creating more space for
active engagement of non-government actors, facilitating increased participation of all
citizens in decision making process at all levels of the government, and strengthening of
fiduciary systems and oversight institutions, are important elements in transforming the
Ethiopian economy and society and achieving middle-income status by 2020-23.

vii.

The vision of the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2009/10-2014/15) is for
Ethiopia to “extricate itself from poverty to reach the level of a middle-income economy
as of 2020-23.” This is to be achieved through strong economic growth within a stable
macroeconomic framework with agriculture and industry as the main drivers; provision of
quality infrastructure and social services (particularly health and education); and good
governance and democratization. There is a large measure of overlap between these priorities
and the challenges Ethiopia faces (paragraph iii above). Development partners have therefore
broadly endorsed the GTP as an appropriate, and GoE-owned, agenda for the coming years.

viii.

To succeed in meeting the GTP goals and sustaining high economic growth, a structural
transformation will need to take place. It would cover the following four dimensions:

ii






Increased productivity and competitiveness of the industrial and services sectors for rapid
and sustained job creation;
Transformation to modern and productive agriculture;
Strengthened systems to better respond to shocks and increase resilience; and,
Improved government effectiveness.

ix.

These objectives need to be pursued concurrently, as strong synergies exist between
them. New and diverse job opportunities in urban, peri-urban and rural areas could draw the
unemployed and underemployed population (mostly youth) from overpopulated rural settings
to where their skills can be utilized more productively. Complementary efforts (e.g.,
provision of key public infrastructure, stable regulatory framework, private sector
engagement, leveraging mobile technologies to enhance the productivity of farmers and
businesses) would be needed to diversify livelihoods and to catalyze a structural
transformation from subsistence agriculture into a more modern and productive agriculture.
Improving the effectiveness of GoE support would also be critical so that it can effectively
and efficiently promote the transformation process through direct and indirect interventions.
GoE also has a key role to play in providing basic social services (e.g., health and education),
which would underpin people’s ability to respond positively to new opportunities. Broadbased economic growth in all sectors of the economy will, in the long term, be the key driver
for sustainable reduction in vulnerability and increased resilience, however, there is also a
need for a comprehensive social protection system that allows GoE to manage risks, respond
to disasters and provide social transfers to the chronically poor.

x.

This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13-16) builds on the progress achieved by
Ethiopia during the past five years and aims to help the Government of Ethiopia
address this structural transformation and assist in the implementation of Ethiopia’s
GTP. It also builds on the findings of the Completion Report on the last Country Assistance
Strategy, the Country Portfolio Performance Review, and consultations with a wide range of
Ethiopian stakeholders. The CPS is results-based, well aligned with the World Bank Strategy
for Africa and selective, based on WBG’s comparative advantage. The CPS framework
includes two pillars with governance as foundation and two cross cutting themes. Pillar One,
“Fostering competitiveness and employment”, aims to support Ethiopia in achieving the
following strategic objectives: (i) a stable macroeconomic environment; (ii) increased
competitiveness and productivity; (iii) increased and improved delivery of infrastructure; and
(iv) enhanced regional integration. Pillar Two, “Enhancing resilience and reducing
vulnerabilities”, aims to support Ethiopia in improving the delivery of social services and
developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk management. Good
governance and state building form the foundation of the CPS. In line with the GTP, gender
and climate change have been included as cross-cutting issues in the CPS to strengthen their
mainstreaming across the portfolio. The programs of IFC and MIGA are well aligned with
the CPS framework, contributing mainly to the strategic objectives under Pillar 1.

xi.

WBG engagement, provided as a combination of partnerships, knowledge and finance,
will be driven by the principle of partnering with GoE to look for pragmatic solutions.
The CPS builds on what has been achieved so far and continues its support in areas where
there is strong government ownership (e.g., infrastructure and social protection). In order to
iii

for the WBG to more effectively support GoE’s medium to long term development agenda,
there are three elements in the CPS that are new. First, the WBG will seek stronger
engagement with the Government on macroeconomic issues, the job creation agenda, and
improving Government capacity to deliver results. Second, in addition to strengthening
already good collaboration with existing development partners, WBG will endeavor to reach
out to non-traditional partners. Third, WBG will deploy to a larger extent than previously its
analytical work and look to provide budget support (most likely starting with sectoral
development policy lending) to deepen policy dialogue, foster the use of country systems and
increase the predictability of Bank support.
xii.

This CPS sets out a proposed IDA program, which will span the last two years of IDA 16
(FY13-14) and the first two years of the expected 17th replenishment of IDA (FY15-16). In
FY12 IDA’s new commitments to Ethiopia amounted to US$1.12 billion. The lending
program for the first two years of the CPS (FY13-14) has been designed with a buffer of
about 19 percent (US$1.5bn in FY13 and US$1.2bn in FY14) to allow for possible delays on
individual operations. A specific IDA allocation for the two outer years of the CPS (FY1516) is not available, since it will depend on the outcome of IDA 17 negotiations and
Ethiopia’s progress on CPIA indicators. The CPS program is therefore indicative and will
have to be reconfirmed based on Ethiopia’s allocation under IDA 17, and discussions with
the Government.

xiii.

Ethiopia faces a range of external and internal risks, the potential impacts of some of
which can be mitigated in part by WBG. Among the key risks identified is the possibility
of external economic shocks, including the negative impact from a protracted slowdown in
the EU and other high income economies, as well as natural disasters, of which droughts
have been the most frequent occurrence in Ethiopia. There is a potential trade-off between
economic growth and overall debt sustainability, especially for a development model which
relies on large public investment in an environment of low levels of domestic savings. For a
number of years Ethiopia has been perceived as having a culture that inhibited corruption,
however, there is a risk that perception will be undermined by the challenges from rapid
economic growth coupled with significant government intervention in the management of the
economy. There is a continuous challenge related to the capacity to deliver results and the
probity of the public service, which may not be able to keep pace with the broader reform
agenda. High turn-over within the public service and the expansion of the number of woredas
will exacerbate this challenge. Among the risks of which WBG needs to be aware, but the
mitigation of which depends on close coordination with development partners in Ethiopia,
are the regional security risks linked to relations with Eritrea, ongoing tensions between
Sudan and South Sudan, and instability fed by Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia. There is
also a risk associated with the death of the Prime Minster and ensuring a smooth transition in
the coming months as described in paragraph iv above. Finally, in the longer term there is
also a risk associated with the next elections scheduled for 2015.

Introduction
1.
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia originally covering
FY2008-11 was discussed by the Board of Directors on April 29, 2008 (Report No. 43051-ET).
In 2010, at the time of the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR, Report No. 55931-ET), that CAS was
extended by one year, to include FY12, due to slower than expected implementation of CAS
activities as well as to allow more time to undertake a necessary poverty diagnostic. While some
adjustments to the lending program were made by the CAS PR, mainly to help mitigate the risks
related to the global food, fuel and financial crises, the key objectives of the CAS were retained.
2.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on the progress achieved by Ethiopia
during the past five years. It also aims to help the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) address
ongoing challenges and assist in the implementation of Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation
Plan (GTP, 2010-15). It covers the period from FY2013 to FY2016, one year beyond the GTP’s
implementation timeframe. As with the previous CAS it is a result-based strategy firmly
anchored in the Government’s program as well as the World Bank Strategy for Africa.1
3.
This paper is organized into four chapters. Chapter I provides a brief political and
economic context followed by a summary of achievements in key areas of economic and human
development over the past decade. Chapter II presents the ongoing challenges faced by Ethiopia
and the approach the Government is taking, as outlined in the GTP, to address them in the
coming years. Chapter III and IV focus on the World Bank Group (WBG) role in Ethiopia
starting with a review of the past WBG assistance followed by a description of the key areas of
the new partnership, its implementation and risks. Appendices and annexes provide additional
information and statistics.

I.

Country Context and Recent Developments
A.

Political Context

4.
Ethiopia is a large, diverse and complex country with political dynamics resulting
from its unique history. Up to 1991, the country had seen a century of increasing state
centralization, underpinned by a political culture reflecting strong hierarchies and social
stratification that have deep social roots. The current government, led by the Ethiopian People’s
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), came to power in 1991 after almost two decades of
armed struggle, overthrowing the repressive military Dergue regime. EPRDF introduced three
key reform processes: federal decentralization of the previously socialist state; market
liberalization of a command economy; and democratization under a multi-party constitution.
Each of these reform processes has progressed to different degrees and enjoyed some notable
successes, but also faced significant constraints.
5.
A phased approach to federal decentralization has been pursued since 1995. While
the Constitution is premised on the philosophy of devolution of authority, practice often tends
1

more towards the deconcentration of responsibility: dominance of the EPRDF and its allies
continuing to administer all levels of government seems to underpin strong de facto national
uniformity. EPRDF’s dominance has allowed it to establish a strongly interventionist
“developmental state” system, which is often perceived as limiting the space and role of nongovernment social, political and economic actors in economic growth, promotion of liberal
democracy and pluralism. These include non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil
society organizations (CSOs), whose role is limited largely to service delivery under recent
legislation; private media outlets, whose activities are also regulated by strict legislation and a
tough judicial approach to editorial freedom; and private sector investors, who also often feel
their interests are neglected by a government determined to curb what it sees as anti-development
“rent-seeking”. Weak opposition groups have struggled for space in this context, with Ethiopia’s
most competitive elections to date concluding in 2005 in bitter post-election contestation and
violence, followed by the reconsolidation of the position of EPRDF. The May 2010
parliamentary elections resulted in a 99.6 percent victory for the ruling EPRDF and its allies,
reducing the opposition from 174 to only two seats in the 547 member lower house. This
weakening of the opposition and marginal role that other non-state actors are playing has created
a polarized dialogue on many key political and economic issues outside Ethiopia, as well as
within.2
6.
Ethiopia occupies a difficult position in the Horn of Africa sandwiched between wartorn Somalia, Eritrea, and the newly divided Sudan and South Sudan. All of these neighbors
generate difficult cross-border problems, often involving cross-border communities. Ethiopia’s
lowland peripheries have long been affected by instability, and its relatively strong state, security
and military systems are regularly deployed domestically - and sometimes also regionally - to
promote GoE interests in national stability and security. However, Ethiopia’s central and
important strategic position in the Horn of Africa also offers important potential for regional
cooperation and collaboration (especially in the water and energy sectors), which could
contribute to a growing inter-dependence between the countries and lead to promote peace and
stability in the region.
7.
Ato Meles Zenawi, the Prime Minister who had led Ethiopia since 1991, died in late
August 2012. Since his death, GoE has embarked on a constitutional process for the transition to
a new Government. The incoming Prime Minister and the Government have reconfirmed their
commitment to political stability, to hold national elections in 2015 (as previously planned), and
to continued implementation of the GTP and other key GoE strategies and policies.

Recent Economic Developments

8.
Since the early 1990s Ethiopia has pursued a “developmental state” model with a
strong role for GoE in many aspects of the economy. This approach, based on high levels of
public sector investment, has been associated with strong rates of broad-based economic growth
since 2001, albeit from a very low base and, since 2010, a particularly ambitious program for
2

The most visible examples of this polarized dialogue include the often critical position taken by parts of the
Ethiopian Diaspora, and the high profile some international NGOs, such as Human Rights Watch and the Committee
to Protect Journalists give to publicizing their concerns about governance in Ethiopia.

state, infrastructure, and economic transformation. Notable progress has been made towards
many MDGs including those for poverty, access to education and health. Important
improvements have been made in basic infrastructure, and in strengthening executive capacity,
and Ethiopia presents a relatively positive picture, particularly at the federal level. It has a track
record of successful management of reform at the higher tiers of government, and there is clear
evidence of a strong and consistent vision guiding policies, which are strongly pro-poor.
Macroeconomic Trends
9.
From 2004-11 Ethiopia experienced strong and generally broad-based real
economic growth of around 10.6 percent a year on average, i.e., more than double the annual
average of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which reached 5.2 percent (Figure 1). Growth
came from a mix of GoE-led development investments, strong global commodity demand, and
the development of new export sectors. More recently annual growth rates have declined
slightly, but still remain at high single-digit levels. The economy is expected to stabilize at
around 8 percent in 2012, largely owing to improved performance in the agriculture sector. The
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annual growth is likely to remain around 8 percent until 2016,
driven by rising foreign investment and exports (EIU, 2012). In addition, despite high population
growth of 2.2 percent a year, GDP per capita (at PPP) has increased from US$965 in 2007/08 to
US$1,196 in 2010/11. Nonetheless, Ethiopia’s GDP per capita remains among the lowest in the
world (169th out of 181 countries, assessed by the World Bank).3

Export growth of goods and services has been strong, averaging close to 10 percent
annually during 2000-10. Agriculture remains a major earner of foreign exchange, accounting
on average for about 90 percent of Ethiopia’s exports over the past decade. Ethiopia has made
good progress in growing and diversifying processed exports, with double digit growth volumes
3

in export categories such as leather and leather products, and meat and meat products over recent
years. The economy, however, remains dependent on primary products (principally coffee) to a
larger extent than other African and Asian comparators.4 This may change in coming years, if
Ethiopia is successful in maintaining recent growth of foreign direct investment (FDI), which
increased from US$0.5 billion in 2007 to US$1.2 billion in 2011 (National Bank of Ethiopia NBE).5 In addition, the mining and energy (hydropower) sectors hold great promise for Ethiopia
as a source of investments and as important catalysts for the Government’s export-orientated
development strategy. Other sectors which appear to have scope for continued export growth and
development include floriculture, hides and leather products.
11.
During 2000-10 imports grew annually by around 15 percent on average due to a
major emphasis on the import of capital goods as part of the government-led growth strategy. As
a result, the trade balance has been in deficit. Likewise, the current account balance has been
negative, even though it improved temporarily in 2010/11, when it recorded a small surplus
resulting from a temporary slowing of investment activities. Yet, consumer goods imports have
recovered since to earlier, albeit low levels. Thus, the current account is expected to turn into
deficit again, and likely to stay there given the import requirements of the GTP and increasing
demand for imported consumer goods.
12.
Ethiopia weathered the 2008 global food-fuel-financial crises relatively well. GDP
growth declined from 11.2 percent in FY2008 to around 10 percent in FY2009, representing only
a marginal difference between projected and actual GDP. Nonetheless, even before the onset of
the 2008 crisis, Ethiopia’s economy was already slowing down. Looking forward, there is a
risk of negative economic impact from a protracted slowdown in the European Union (EU)
and other high-income economies, mainly through reduced remittances and slowing
demand for exports. A slowdown of remittances (standing at around 9 percent of GDP) could
reduce disposable income and ultimately decrease domestic consumption. Although Ethiopian
exports are only around 15 percent of GDP, they may be vulnerable due to the high
concentration of commodity and primary goods and to the 50-plus percentage share of OECD as
export destination.
13.
Recent high inflation rates are a particular concern for Ethiopia and its economy.
Inflation has a negative impact on poverty, possibly pushing poverty up by as much as 0.5
percent for each 1 percent increase in the inflation rate (World Bank Working Paper, WP3378).
Further, inflation negatively affects the domestic savings rate, which for the past decade (200010) has been at low single-digit levels, as well as the private investment rate, both of which are
vital to finance ambitious GTP investment targets. Headline inflation rates in Ethiopia have
largely been driven by developments in food price inflation and partially by the increasing global
commodity prices. Since 2005, there have been two major spikes (Figure 2). In August 2008,
4

During 2005-09 share of manufactured exports as a share of total exports in Ethiopia was only 13 percent
compared to China (90 percent), Cambodia (90), Bangladesh (93) and Vietnam (58). In case of light manufacturing,
its share in total exports was 9 percent compared to China (91 percent), Cambodia (89), Bangladesh (91) and
Vietnam (43). UNIDO, 2011

Currently most FDI originates from China, India and Turkey and focuses on agriculture, textile and leather. Most
deals are negotiated case-by-case, generally as a result of high-level bilateral official visits. Despite growth in
private FDI, it only represented 0.6 percent of GDP in 2010 (World Bank, WDI).

Page 4

headline inflation (year on year) peaked at 61.6 percent, driven by 79.2 percent food price
inflation; likewise, in August and September 2011 inflation was 40.7 and 40.2 percent
respectively, at a time when food inflation reached almost 50 percent. Food inflation kept rising
to more than 50 percent in November 2011, but by then headline inflation had started to ease
slowly, driven by a tightening monetary stance (base money growth stabilized at the end of
2011).

Non-food inflation, a measure of core inflation, shows a relatively high persistent level,
which indicates that inflation in Ethiopia is not purely a food price problem. In both spikes of
2008 and 2011 non-food inflation rose above 20 percent. In the 84 months between January 2005
and December 2011, core inflation was between 10 and 20 percent for 34 months, and above 20
percent for 25 months. Non-food inflation likely has several drivers in Ethiopia, including:
relatively high overall monetary growth in the system, inflation expectations (which could be
further fuelled by food price-inflation), and currency devaluation, which increases the prices for
imported goods.
15.
While high inflation persists, it is showing a slightly decreasing trend. Recognizing
the difficulties that inflation poses for its economy and the poor, GoE has been executing
stringent cash-based budgeting and negative reserve money growth. 6 As a result, headline
inflation rates, which were above 33 percent on average during all of 2011, started to ease at the
end of the year, and reached 20.9 percent in June 2012. However, international prices for
Ethiopian food staples are now rising sharply, and this has in the past led to increased inflation in
Ethiopia.
16.
The exchange rate has continued to steadily depreciate since September 2010,
following the 20 percent nominal deprecation in August 2010, consistent with the long-term
6

The trend to tighten monetary base was slightly reversed in December 2011 primarily due to a drawdown in
government deposits at the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). At the same time reserve requirement ratios were
lowered by 5 percentage points in January 2012.

trend. Overall the Birr has depreciated by 97 percent over the course of 5 years. This trend is
largely mirrored in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate which shows a steady path of
depreciation between September 2008 and December 2011. The Real Effective Exchange Rate,
however, has been on an appreciating trend since December 2010, which coincides with and
largely originates in the recently observed high inflation rates.7

Note: Government growth estimates and projections differ for 2010/11 and beyond and are above 11% per year (e.g.: 2010/11
estimate 11.4%, and 2012/13 projection 11.3%).

17.
Fiscal policy needs to play a key role in GoE’s efforts to reduce inflation over the
short run as well as mobilize and spend resources efficiently in the medium-term. While the
current federal budget stance is tight, supported by significant increases in revenues, quasi-fiscal
activities are growing (such as domestically and externally financed investment activities of
state-owned enterprises). The overall general government deficit in 2010/11 was 1.6 percent of
GDP, financed mostly by external project loans and privatization receipts almost without
recourse to net domestic financing. Federal government data for the first half of 2011/12
indicates that the revenue performance was improved, the overall deficit was reduced, and a
large repayment to the banking system from GoE was recorded. The latter, however, resulted in a
large deposit accumulation at the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) which has
been extending credits to state-owned enterprises at a very rapid rate (IMF, 2012). Regarding the
revenue side, implementation of the authorities’ tax reform strategy, which was started in 2010,
is ongoing and already shows significant improvements in tax collection. On the expenditure
side, implementation of public financial management (PFM) reforms, including the move to a
program-based budgeting is ongoing and would need to be deepened to prepare for a possible
increase of budget support programs of development partners. At the same time, the current tight
fiscal policy stance needs to be maintained to support the reduction of inflation.

The latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out for the 2011/12 period
indicates that Ethiopia remains at low risk of external debt distress – similar to the findings
for 2009/10 and 2010/11.8 However, given the large financing requirements of the GTP, it is
expected that debt ratios will rise moderately in the medium-term but stabilize in the long-term.
Analysis indicates that borrowing from domestic sources is constrained and public enterprises
will continue to rely significantly on external financing to sustain the large infrastructure
investments that are expected to drive growth; for the latter a growing share is expected to be on
non-concessional terms. Consistent with GoE's intention to keep a low risk of external debt
distress, the amount of non-concessional borrowing will be limited. Indeed there may be a tradeoff between GoE’s desire to maintain a low risk rating and the implementation pace of the GTP.
In other words, GoE may need to increase the implementation period of the GTP in order to
smooth the profile of the non-concessional financing requirements for the planned investments.
Ethiopia is subject to the IDA Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP). In the absence of an
IMF program, IDA could establish a non-concessional borrowing limit if it was consistent with
the maintenance of low debt vulnerabilities, and if the planned investments are critical and
growth-enhancing.9 Recently GoE officially requested a non-concessional borrowing limit of
US$ 1 billion and the Board will be informed of IDA management’s decision as specified in the
NCBP.
Governance and Public Sector Management
19.
During the past decade Ethiopia has made impressive progress on the
decentralization of authority and service delivery. A phased approach to federal
decentralization has been adopted, with a transfer of powers from GoE to Regional States (199195) followed by the decentralization of service delivery first to woredas (districts) and, for some
aspects, down to kebeles (villages) (2001- ongoing). Kebele councils have been enlarged, and
kebele managers put in place to be focal points for service delivery and to handle complaints.
The capacity and institutions built at decentralized levels have resulted in improved access to
basic services and to decision-making bodies.10 Serious efforts have been made at reforming the
tax system (including policy revision, structural review, adoption of ICT and taxpayer
education), resulting in a fivefold tax collection increase from 2005 to 2012. The legal and policy
frameworks and operational systems of urban centers have also been reformed, and capacities
strengthened.
20.
Public Financial Management reforms have made good progress over the last
decade, although further reforms are needed. This progress was facilitated through
strengthening of the legal framework for PFM; rolling out of simple but easy to use
computerized systems such as IBEX (Integrated Budget and Expenditure Management System)
across GoE and regional administrations; extensive training for PFM staff; and building of
8

See Appendix 5 for details.
The ability to establish a non-zero ceiling for non-concessional lending in IDA's NCBP in the absence of an IMF
program was outlined in "IDA's Non-concessional Borrowing Policy: Progress Update", April, 2010. (IDA Sec
54240).
10
According to the 2011 Woreda and City Benchmarking Survey, an independent survey of local governments,
during 2005-11 percentage of jurisdictions graded as “high performers” by their constituencies has increased from
25 to 88 percent.

capacity at institutions including the Offices of the Federal Auditor General (OFAG) and the
eleven Regional Auditor Generals. Several important laws have been drafted including: 11 a
Financial Reporting Law and the law establishing a regulatory body for the accountancy
profession in Ethiopia, which mandates the establishment of the Institute of Certified
Accountants and adoption of accounting standards as well as International Standards on
Auditing. Currently, a review of the 1960 commercial code is ongoing under the auspices of the
Ministry of Justice, and supported by the World Bank. While Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessments of 2007 and 2011 have noted improvements, they have also
noted the wide variability in capacity, systems and practices that exist across the country. These
assessments have highlighted the need to address remaining PFM weaknesses in tax collection,
procurement, internal and external audit, structured training, legislative oversight and scrutiny as
well as transparency (see discussion in paragraph 89).
21.
The implementation of fiscal decentralization is still ongoing. Although resources
flowing through the block grant system are increasing, they are flowing to a rapidly increasing
number of woredas, many of whom have yet to develop in full the capacity to handle and
manage these funds. Furthermore, on average, 80 percent of these resources are used to fund
salary costs while resources for capital expenditures are limited. Woredas have limited discretion
on the allocation and utilization of these funds. In order to make further progress GoE needs to
further explore mandates over revenue and expenditure within its intergovernmental transfers
system. The affordability and sustainability of financing the large (and increasing) number of
woredas also needs to be carefully analyzed.
22.
Public Sector Reform has been high on Government’s agenda, and is rooted in its
long term strategy of state transformation articulated in the early 1990s. There have been a
series of modernization efforts across the public service including: business process
reengineering (BPR) implemented at all levels of government; introduction of a balanced score
card fostering greater customer orientation and performance management in service delivery;
improvements in transparency and of the budget process; and access to information. Nonetheless,
there is a high level of staff turnover and churning in the public service which affects the quality
of service delivery. Whilst this phenomenon is not fully understood a strategy for civil service
reform, with an overhaul of GoE human resource policies, including pay scales, should be
considered as a matter of priority by GoE going forward (see paragraph 86).
23.
The legislative and regulatory framework has undergone significant strengthening
in recent years, through overhauling of old acts and enactment of improved proclamations in
civil service, decentralization, tax (income and turnover tax, Value Added Tax), finance (public
finance proclamation, procurement, cash management directives), Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), city proclamations and urban policies, asset registration and
disclosure, and criminal laws as well as laws that determine the powers and responsibilities of
the three branches of government. GoE has also embarked on efforts to increase the transparency
and accountability of its mining-derived financial flows, which are being analyzed, discussed,
11

Drafting of these laws was recommended by the Report on Observance and Codes - Accounting and Auditing
conducted in 2007.

and made publicly available under the World Bank-supported Ethiopian Revenue Transparency
Initiative. Nonetheless, Ethiopia can still do more to improve its business environment (see
paragraph 30 and 62).
24.
Regarding anti-corruption measures, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption
Commission has overseen the establishment of regional commissions in all regions, with a
network of Ethics officers in all regional bureaux. The development of investigative capacitates
of staff at the Commissions is still a work in progress, is moving in the right direction. The
legislature at federal level has passed a number of laws aimed at enabling an environment for
fighting corruption. Initiatives around asset disclosure for political leaders and public officials
(defined as “government appointees, elected persons and public officials” in the Disclosure and
Registration of Assets Proclamation, 2010) at federal level have resulted in the recording and
disclosure of assets in respect of over 40,000 individuals.
Agriculture and Rural Development
25.
Agriculture remains the cornerstone of the Ethiopian economy and the most
important source of growth. It accounts for almost 48 percent of GDP and 85 percent of export
earnings. Principal crops include coffee, maize, teff, wheat, sorghum and other cereals, pulses
(e.g., beans), oilseeds, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. 12 From 2007/8 to 2010/11 the
agriculture sector was reported to have grown by 6.5 percent a year on average. According to
official statistics, agricultural productivity of wheat, teff and sorghum increased by an average of
14 percent,13 due to investments in agricultural extension, some increases in inputs (especially
fertilizer), improvements in land tenure security and management as well as significant increases
in the area farmed (by over 2 percent annually). Ethiopia is also the 10th largest producer of
livestock in the world and, with 75 million head of livestock, has the largest concentration of
livestock on the African continent. Agriculture remains a major earner of foreign exchange, with
coffee, oilseeds, qat, flower, pulses, live animal and hides and skins making up the bulk of
Ethiopia’s total exports.
26.
Agriculture is the main income earner, livelihood and way-of-living for 85 percent
of Ethiopians living in rural areas.14 Ethiopia’s agricultural production is by and large rain-fed
and dominated by small-scale farmers and enterprises. While much of Ethiopia’s agriculture
remains for subsistence purposes, smallholders also provide a large part of traded commodities,
including for exports. Food is also the main consumption item for Ethiopian households,
accounting for about 57 percent of the consumption basket (excluding beverages). Given the
Ethiopia is Africa’s biggest coffee producer and second biggest maize producer. It is the biggest teff producer in
the world.
13
However some independent studies shed some doubts on the reliability of the official statistics. For instance,
according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Food Program (WFP) Crop and Food Security
Assessment Mission to Ethiopia (2010) “national cereal and pulse production in 2009/10 is some 4.7 percent below
the all time record harvest in 2008/09 but still about 7 percent above the previous five years average. Sorghum and
maize crops have been most adversely affected, while production of teff and barley is less affected and production of
wheat is expected to increase.” p.4.
14
Rural population is increasing at about 2.4 percent annually (e.g., over 1.5 million people). Currently, migration to
urban areas is much smaller than rural population growth rate.
12

Page 9

large rural share of the total population, there is a strong correlation between recent agricultural
growth and the significant reduction in rural poverty. In recent years, GoE has been increasingly
interested in pursuing large commercial agriculture schemes especially in crops with export
potential (e.g., sugar cane) and in collaboration with the private sector, both domestic and
foreign, which brings both opportunities and challenges going forward (see paragraph 78).
27.
Land remains one of the main structural and regulatory challenges that Ethiopia
faces, as a critical input into all economic activities (rural and urban). According to the Ethiopian
Constitution, land belongs to “the State and the people of Ethiopia.” Private ownership of land is
not allowed. Instead, private users have user rights that are different for rural and urban areas and
vary by region; a significant amount of land is informally used. Formal land markets are
underdeveloped and do not exist in many areas, and land is generally undervalued. Given the
country’s strong economic growth, urban and industrial development, and larger-scale
agricultural investments, the challenges and demand for improved land tenure security, access to
land, land use planning and land management are further increasing. To address these
challenges, Ethiopia can build on strong in-country experience and focus on strengthening: (i)
the legal and regulatory framework; (ii) the organization set-up and administrative capacity; and
(iii) the provision of effective land administration services.15
Industry and Services
28.
For the past five years (2007/08 – 2010/11), industry and the service sector have
experienced strong average real growth of 10.2 and 10.8 percent a year respectively.
However, while the rate of growth of industry has accelerated, partially due to increased FDI,
services registered a recent slowdown to 6.7 percent from 11.7 percent (IMF, 2012).16 The output
structure remains reflective of a developing economy in early transition, with agriculture
accounting for 48 percent of GDP, industry for 14 percent, and services for 38 percent (2010).
The manufacturing sector has been growing in value terms at similar rates as GDP but remains
small in terms of its contribution to GDP (5.5 percent in 2011) and employment – only around 13
percent of the employed population in urban areas is engaged in manufacturing, and the
corresponding annual growth in employment has been a modest 4 percent during the last three
years (CSA 2009, 2010 and 2011).
29.
Public investment has in recent years been one of the major drivers of economic
growth in Ethiopia. The growth in GoE and the activities of state enterprises have multiplied.
Credit to the public sector from the banking system has increased five-fold from 2004/05 to
2010/11 from Birr 8 billion to an estimated 42 billion, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all
banking system credit. 17 Despite a robust privatization program (so far more than 115 stateowned enterprises (SOEs) have been privatized) the share of public corporations, which are
predominantly large and medium sized SOEs, has been relatively stable (around 8.6 percent of
15

Ethiopia: Options for Strengthening Land Administration, World Bank, 2011.
There are some discrepancies between the official Government data and those of IMF. For example, real GDP
growth in industry in 2010/11 is registered at 15 percent by GOE as opposed to IMF figure of 12.5 percent. The
variance is much higher with regard to the growth rate in services where IMF has shown a decline of 6.7 percent
while GOE has registered a slight increase in growth rate to 12.5 percent.

GDP). Further, several large enterprises that the Government considers strategic remain in the
public domain resulting in limited scope for private participation and competition.18
30.
The domestic private sector is dominated by the Figure 3: Doing Business in Ethiopia (2012)
informal sector. In services and manufacturing the
informal sector is growing but continues to be
characterized by low productivity. The formal private
sector represents a small part of the economy – a recent
study estimated that private corporations generated only
2.7 percent of GDP and employed just 5.8 percent of the
workforce. It is dominated by large and medium sized
formal firms and includes mostly endowment companies
(i.e., companies controlled by EPRDF) and FDI. One of
the contributing factors to the small size of the formal
private sector is the fact that, despite some positive developments in industry and service sectors,
Ethiopia has been a difficult place to do business. In Doing Business 2012, Ethiopia ranked 111th
out of 183 economies and 7th out of the 18 economies that make up the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).19 In this regard, Ethiopia’s ranking has not improved
significantly over the past few years and the pace of reforms is slowing down (e.g., registration
and licensing regulations as shown in Box 1). Ethiopia’s performance is also uneven across the
Doing Business indicators (Figure 3), with particularly slow progress in removing barriers to
trading across the borders, which in the context of regional collaboration, presents a significant
barrier to Ethiopia’s export-driven growth.
Financial Sector
31.
The Ethiopian banking sector is relatively underdeveloped compared with its
regional peers and plays a limited role in the economy. The Banking system comprises one
development bank (the Development Bank of Ethiopia – DBE), two state-owned commercial
banks (CBE and the Construction and Business Bank) and 14 private banks. There are no
foreign-owned banks. In 2010/11 CBE’s assets were about ETB180 billion (up from ETB53
billion in 2004/05), which accounted for about 70 percent of the banking sector’s total assets; its
market share in terms of credits is almost 75 percent, and in terms of deposits 65 percent. The
remaining 15 banks are mainly private and have combined assets of ETB86 billion. In addition
there are 30 Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs), of which the five largest MFIs (owned by
regional Governments) represent 85 percent of 2.5 million clients and 90 percent of overall
outstanding loans (as of September 2011). 20 Regarding the overall financial sector depth
(measured by private sector credit/GDP) Ethiopia’s standing is comparable with Uganda and
18

Public corporations that the GOE considers strategic include: Ethiopian Air Lines, Ethiopian Shipping Lines,
Ethiopian Telecoms, Ethiopian Electric and Power Corporation, Ethiopian Metal Engineering Corporation,
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Development Bank of Ethiopia, and Construction and Business Bank.
19
These results are also corroborated by the Global Competitiveness Index. Accordingly in 2010-11 Ethiopia was
119th (out of 139) in terms of its overall competitiveness, 127th with regard to macroeconomic environment, 105th in
innovation, 129th in higher education and training and 121st in financial market development.
20
According to quarterly data on MFIs collected by the Association of Ethiopian MFIs, in Q3 2011 the total capital
of all MFIs reached Birr 2.5bn; the stock of outstanding loans was Birr 6.7bn and savings were Birr 2.1bn.

Tanzania, especially after accounting for Ethiopia’s lower income per capita. However, while
Ethiopia’s regional peers have seen credit to the private sector as a proportion of GDP rise
substantially over the last five years (2006-2010)21, in Ethiopia this ratio has fallen from 18
percent to 15 percent (NBE).

with commercial banks as a percent of GDP has declined from 38 to 28 percent. Similarly, while
the number of borrowers from commercial banks per 1,000 adults has increased from 1.2 to 1.9,
outstanding loans from commercial banks as a percent of GDP went down from 19 to 14 percent.
The ability of the commercial banks to collect deposits and provide loans to the real sector is
restricted by negative real interest rates prevailing in the economy and a recent GoE requirement
on the commercial banks to allot 27 percent of their loan disbursements to purchase T-bills.
While there are some encouraging trends in accessibility and use of financial services, there is
substantial scope for the financial sector can play a more active role supporting the
Government’s growth and transformation agenda. One of the possible areas worthwile exploring
in Ethiopia is mobile banking, which over the past few years has substantially changed the access
to banking services in Kenya and Tanzania, especially for the rural poor (see also paragraph 35).
Infrastructure
33.
Over the past decade, Ethiopia has made significant improvements in access to and
quality of its infrastructure. It is estimated that if Ethiopia’s infrastructure platform could be
improved to the level of the African leader, Mauritius, annual per capita growth rates could
increase by 3.8 percent.22 Further, given Ethiopia is a landlocked country, connectivity with its
neighbors and with the rest of the world brings important challenges as well as opportunities.
Ethiopian Airlines is now one of the three main sub-Saharan African airlines and Bole Airport
serves as a regional air transport hub for passenger and commodity transport (including cash
crops such as floriculture). The quality of Ethiopia’s road network has increased: 80 percent of
the paved network of over 40,000 kilometers is in good or fair condition (2010).23 Nonetheless,
road density is still low: only 10 percent of the rural population lives within two kilometers of an
all-weather road, which is only half of the benchmark level for low income countries in sub21

For example, private sector credit/GDP between 2006 and 2010 in Kenya went from 26 to 34 percent, in Uganda
from 10 to 16 percent and in Tanzania from 13 to 16 percent (World Bank WDI, 2011).

Saharan Africa. Ethiopia’s primary transport corridor is through Djibouti and GoE has recently
initiated construction of a 5,000 kilometer national railway to link Addis Ababa with Djibouti,
of which the first 2,000 kilometer phase is anticipated to be developed by 2015. Ethiopia is
actively trying to develop a rail industry to serve the broader region including South Sudan,
Somalia (Puntland) and northern Kenya. The Government is also exploring alternative routes to
market including Berbera and Lamu.
34.
Access to improved water and sanitation is rising rapidly, albeit from a very low base.
Close to five percent of Ethiopia’s population is gaining access to improved water every year.
Though reliance on surface water is in decline and the emphasis has shifted to multiple uses of
ground water sources, matching drilling capacity with the demand for source development has
been a challenge. Moreover, the assessment of groundwater potential and the management of
groundwater resources have not been given sufficient attention. Exceptionally rapid expansion of
traditional latrines has benefited 60 percent of Ethiopia’s population (Health and Sanitation
Action Plan, 2012). The practice of open defecation, while still widespread, is declining steeply,
due mainly to the government’s health extension program and partly the deployment of more
than 34,000 health extension workers to implement a comprehensive health and sanitation
package. GoE in collaboration with their development partners has made progress towards
establishing a harmonized and integrated Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)
program and is putting in place the corresponding institutional arrangement for its universal
access plan to provide access to improved water supply for the entire population by 2015.
35.
The GTP has a clear vision to “embrace ICT as essential to creating new jobs, new
business opportunities, to education and to improving the effectiveness of government
administration and service delivery.” To improve the country’s mobile, internet and
broadband penetration rates, GoE signed in 2011 a contract with France Telecom to manage the
state-owned Ethiopian Telecom Company (ETC). After almost a year ETC now serves over 15
million subscribers and expects its total mobile subscriber base to increase to 50 million at the
end of 2015, by extending coverage from 50 to 90 percent. To increase the quality and reliability
of service, ETC has completed steps to eliminate faulty power equipment in Addis Ababa, and is
assessing equipment needs in regional states. In addition, it has signed an agreement with the
Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) to facilitate the installation of optical fiber
between Addis Ababa and Bahir Dar and Addis Ababa and Galafi. Ethiopia's fixed-line and
internet penetration rates of 1 and 0.9 percent respectively (2011) rank among the lowest in the
region; ETC plans to expand its internet subscriber base from the current 180,000 to five million
by 2015.
36.
Since 2005 electricity access in Ethiopia has been growing rapidly. 41 percent of rural
towns and villages are now connected to the grid and the number of consumers connected grew
from 800,000, in 2005, to more than 2 million in 2011 (14 percent coverage). During the same
time, off-grid programs, such as: efficient cook stoves and solar lighting, have brought access to
modern energy services to over 4 million households. The average rate of growth of demand for
electricity was above 15 percent a year during 2005-10,24 and EEPCO implemented demand side
management by replacing existing incandescent lamps with CFLs. Ethiopia is endowed with vast

hydropower potential and could become one of the largest power exporters in Africa. In 2010,
EEPCO commissioned three large hydro power plants 25 that increased its power generation
capacity from about 850 MW to above 2,000 MW, providing sufficient capacity to service the
current demand26 and allowing high-cost thermal plants to be decommissioned from the grid.
New regional interconnectors to facilitate regional power trade are underway with Djibouti (in
operation since 2010), Sudan (expected in 2012) and Kenya (expected in 2017).
Climate Variability
37.
Ethiopia is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. Ethiopia has become
warmer over the past century and rainfall variability is predicted to increase further. Impacts of
droughts and floods will be the most acute impacts on agriculture and on average cost the
economy about one percentage point of GDP growth per year. 27 However, Ethiopia is also
vulnerable in terms of other sectors including water, transport, industry, energy, health, and in
terms of its environmental resources. A multifaceted approach is needed to address the
challenges posed by climate change, including but not limited to interventions in the agriculture
sector; better management of natural resources such as land, forestry, groundwater; and
promotion of “green technologies” (see discussion in paragraph 79). Reducing population growth
will also be essential in reducing the stress on natural resources and addressing environmental
degradation.

worsened in rural areas. Nevertheless, the poverty rate in Ethiopia as measured by international
standards remains very high: 39 percent of Ethiopians live below US$1.25 a day; 78 percent of
Ethiopians live under US$2 a day ((United Nations Development Program - UNDP); and the

Education
39.
There has been encouraging, albeit uneven, progress towards achieving the
education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ethiopia continues to give high priority to
the education sector by channeling significant public resources to education – in 2010/11
education expenditures were equal to 4.6 percent of GDP or 24.9 percent of public expenditure.
While, as a result Ethiopia is on track to achieve gender parity in primary education (MDG Goal
3) it will likely not achieve universal primary education (MDG Goal 2).29 The primary Gender
Parity Index (GPI) increased from 0.87 in 2006/07 to 0.94 on 2010/11. In the same time period
increase in access to primary education was modest: the net enrollment rate (NER) increased
from 79 to 85 percent, an annual growth rate of 1.9 percent, which was less than the population
growth rate. Grade 8 completions increased at 2.8 percent a year, but remain low at 49.4 percent.
The gross enrollment rate (GER) of early childhood development grew rapidly at 13.8 percent a
year during 2006-11 though from a low base of 3.1 percent. Ethiopia has set an ambitious target
of achieving universal general secondary education (grades 9-10) by 2025 as part of its strategy
to become a middle-income country (MIC) by that year.30 However, progress with the expansion
of general secondary education was slow reaching 38.4 percent coverage in 2010/11. There was
good progress in the expansion of coverage for grades 11-12 – GER increased from 5.5 to 8.1
percent. Higher education is rapidly expanding – the gross enrollment ratio for which has
increased from about 1 percent in 2000 to about 5 percent in 2010, and is expected to reach over
9 percent by 2015.31 Moving forward, more emphasis needs to be placed on addressing the
quality of education, which is lagging behind (see paragraphs 65 and 81).
Health and Nutrition
40.
Ethiopia is on track to reach the child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and malaria MDGs
(United Nations MDG Progress Assessment). The latest data report that between 1997/01 and
2007/11 Ethiopia experienced a rapid decrease in child mortality rates: neonatal mortality
declined more than 30 percent (to 37 deaths per 1,000); infant mortality declined by 42 percent
(to 59 deaths per 1,000); and under-5 mortality has been almost halved (to 88 deaths per
1,000). 32 The latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data finds that during 2005-11
maternal mortality changed only insignificantly (decline from 676 to 673 deaths per 100,000 live
births) as well as proportion of births attended by a skilled person (increase from 6 to 10
percent). While these MDG targets are still achievable, they will require intensified efforts (see
paragraph 82).
41.
The driving force behind Ethiopia’s success in the health sector has been a sound sector
strategy – the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) – which over the past 15 years has
governed investments of the Government and its development partners to expand health
infrastructure and strengthen health service delivery systems. Ethiopia is also at the forefront of
international health initiatives and partnerships: it was the first country to sign the International

42.
Ethiopia has one of the highest burdens of chronic under-nutrition in the world,
despite some decreases of anemia in children and women. During 2005-11, prevalence of
anemia among preschool aged children and women age 15-49 years was reduced by 10
percentage points each.34 Reductions have been larger in urban areas, and larger reductions have
been recorded for the worse classifications (e.g., moderate and severe anemia). Nonetheless,
anemia prevalence rates remain high at 44 and 17 percent (2011) in preschool aged children and
women aged 15-49 years, respectively. According to the recent analysis by CSA (2011), less
than one-fifth of households consume iodized salt. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies affect
millions of women and children across the country. Among under-five children, 29 percent are
underweight and 44 percent are stunted (chronic under-nutrition - short for their age).35 Stunting
rates are similar in both food secure and food insecure woredas and children are undernourished
in one-quarter of even the richest households. It is estimated that Ethiopia will lose more than
US$13 billion from 2006-15 due to iron deficiency anemia and stunting. 36 This evidence
suggests chronic under-nutrition is not only an issue of access to food, but also about provision
of the right combination of food as well as of caring practices and disease.
Social Protection
43.
Despite substantial decreases in poverty rates, vulnerability exists in Ethiopia at
individual and community levels. Sources of vulnerability are manifold including natural
disasters (e.g., droughts and floods); food shortages; macroeconomic shocks (e.g., high levels of
inflation); health and nutrition risks (e.g., HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases); conflict and
environmental degradation coupled with climate change. These shocks by themselves have an
immediate effect of lowering living standards and perpetuating the poverty trap among the poor
and the vulnerable. Because there are currently few possibilities to insure against these shocks,
poor Ethiopians adopt negative coping mechanisms, such as accumulating livestock, even if the
returns are low, or taking their children out of school to work on the farm, which are likely to
keep them in poverty now and for future generations. Although Ethiopia is a young country (70
percent of Ethiopians are below 30 years old), 3.6 million people are over the age of sixty and
most them have no reliable income sources. Finally, limited opportunities for income-earning
33

The MDG Fund is managed by the Ministry of Health and follows government procedures. Several health
partners (e.g., Department for International Development DFID, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization
GAVI, Italian Cooperation, the Spanish Government, United Nations Population Fund UNFPA) have so far pledged
over US$200 million into the MDG Fund.
34
Anemia is of particular concern for children as it can increase morbidity from infectious diseases and it is found to
lower educational outcomes by impairing abilities to learn. Anemia in women signals poor nutritional status and
increases risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

employment in rural and urban areas results in significant un- and underemployment especially
among young Ethiopians.
44.
Despite a wide range of social protection actions implemented across the country,
prevalence of vulnerabilities is on the rise and food insecurity is a significant developmental
challenge. The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), Ethiopia’s largest social protection
program and one component of the Food Security Program, 37 has had a positive impact on
livelihoods, especially during times of crisis.38 However, while the food security situation of
program beneficiaries has improved and productive assets and livestock holdings have increased,
graduation levels from the program (1.4 million thus far) have been lower than anticipated in the
GTP. Addressing the issue of vulnerabilities and food insecurity exclusively by means of social
protection is not going to yield the expected results nor reduce the number of households
participating in the program in a sustainable way. Broad-based economic growth with agriculture
and industry as the main drivers is clearly seen as key in reducing poverty, vulnerabilities and
increasing resilience in the medium- to long-term. Simultaneously, strengthening national
systems is needed to improve delivery of social services (e.g., health and education) and to better
prepare and respond to shocks (discussed in Chapter II, section C).
D.

Gender

45.
GoE has a strong commitment to gender equality, which is firmly rooted in national
policies as well as in the signing of international and regional treaties and protocols on women’s
rights. The GTP highlights gender as a cross cutting theme (p.110). The Ministry of Women,
Youth and Children’s Affairs contributes to policy development and supports gender
mainstreaming in all government ministries and bureaus and spearheads responses to address
gender inequalities.39 To date gender units have been established in all line ministries and in the
regions. However, implementation capacity remains a serious challenge.
46.
Over the past decade, Ethiopia recorded good progress towards gender equality in
education and health.40 During 2006-11 the female GER for primary and secondary education
increased from 84 to 93 percent and from 25 to 35 percent respectively. Due to extensive
campaigns and increased availability, use of contraceptives doubled from 2005 to 2011 (from 15
to 29 percent) and family planning increased from 25 to 60 percent of households (Ethiopia
Population and Housing Census 2007). Fertility declined by 10 percent, while adolescent fertility
was reduced by 35 percent in the same period. Despite these efforts, the share of women without
education is almost double that of men (51 versus 29 percent in 2011), and literacy levels of
women are markedly lower than those of men especially in rural areas and among urban poor.
The retention level of girls in secondary education is lower than that of boys, and the gender gap
is steep in tertiary education. Finally, harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation
and early marriages are widely practiced and gender based violence are widespread.

Significant progress has been made in providing joint land certification for wives
and husbands in rural areas of the four main regions of the country. More than 20 million landuse certificates have been issued with both spouses’ names and photos on the certificates, and
women’s registration for land increased significantly. Some of the benefits of those programs are
already becoming apparent as women are showing a strong sense of ownership and security that
their rights will be upheld in case of divorce. More intensified efforts are needed to improve
women’s access to farm inputs, extension advice and credit, which will contribute to increased
land productivity and the country’s economic growth.

II.

Development Challenges and the Government Agenda

48.
The development agenda of Ethiopia for the next 3 years (until 2014/15) is governed
by the Growth and Transformation Plan, GoE’s strategy that has been under implementation
since 2010/11.41 The main goals of the GTP are for Ethiopia to “extricate itself from poverty to
reach the level of a middle-income economy as of 2020-23.” Drawing from lessons learned from
the prior poverty reduction strategy (PASDEP, 2005-10), the GTP has the following objectives
(Appendix 1): (a) to attain a high average real GDP growth rate of 11 percent per annum within a
stable macroeconomic framework; (b) to achieve MDG goals in the social sectors, especially the
quality of education and health services; and (c) to establish a stable and democratic,
developmental state. In order to attain these goals, GTP places strong emphasis on economic
growth and job creation with industry and modern agriculture as key drivers. During the
transition period social protection will play an important role, especially in providing safety nets
to the large food-insecure population.
49.
The “developmental state” model adopted by GoE has shown significant results
over the past decade, nevertheless attaining the GTP goals will most likely become more
difficult in coming years as the easier gains have already been made, and the global
environment is not as conducive as before. Enabling the country to move to the higher growth
trajectory needed to achieve these goals may require attention to several challenges, including:
ensuring macroeconomic stability; addressing the persistently high numbers of poor and foodinsecure people despite double-digit economic growth and gains in poverty reduction; lagging
quality of social services; and the weak capacity of the public sector.
50.
The development model adopted by GoE relies heavily on high levels of largely
government-led investments (like the Asian model of development), but faces low saving
rates and limited availability of domestic resources (unlike the Asian model). Given the high
investment requirements of the GTP, public investments which in the past years have been one
of the major drivers of economic growth in Ethiopia, may not be sufficient on their own to
maintain Ethiopia’s high growth performance going forward. GoE needs to continue its efforts to
complement its own financing with additional domestic and foreign investments and to increase
the share of the formal private sector. Over-reliance on public sector investments could result in
41

Appendix 1 provides GTP vision, pillars and selected targets.

an increasing deficit on the External Current Account over the medium to long-term with the
possibility of increased external vulnerability. Since opportunities for external borrowing will be
limited, high fiscal deficits may occur, which in turn may further crowd out private investment or
contribute to increasing inflation rates, if the deficits are monetized.
51.
A major challenge for monetary policy will be to keep inflation subdued, despite
recent bouts of high inflation which could have reversed some of the positive poverty trends. The
efficiency of current monetary policy is hampered by two main barriers: negative real interest
rates, which limit demand for government bonds and Treasury Bills (T-bills) and thus the ability
of GoE to finance its ambitious development plans; and direct central bank financing of the
government deficit. At the same time, monetary policy instruments are very limited in Ethiopia
relying mainly on interventions in the foreign exchange market (e.g., selling foreign currency to
absorb domestic liquidity). High and persistent inflation also negatively impacts savings, which
at current levels of 6-7 percent of GDP are insufficient to support GTP’s growth targets.
52.
Another challenge facing Ethiopia is to ensure that poverty gains are sustainable
and that high economic growth benefits the poor. As discussed in paragraph 38, based on the
2010/11 HICE and Welfare Monitoring Surveys, the proportion of poor people in the country
declined to 29.6 percent and food poverty to 33.6 percent. However, the number of poor in
2010/11 estimated at 25 million is still at the same absolute level as 15 years ago (25.6 million in
1995/96) and food poverty has increased in absolute terms from 27 million people in to 28.4
million, partially due to population growth. Despite strong real GDP and GDP per capita growth,
the number of chronic and transitory food-insecure people remains persistently high, reaching
the same absolute number of people in need as during the 2003 crisis (Figure 4). If the current
high level of livelihood dependency on subsistence agriculture remains, food insecurity and
vulnerability will likely increase because of the impact from climate change.

While access to basic social services (especially health and education) and
infrastructure has considerably improved, the quality of those services and public sector
capacity has not kept pace. This is partly due to the focus on increased access in order to
achieve the MDGs, which has placed a strain on existing facilities. However, accelerated
economic growth will increasingly require skilled labor that can respond to the changing
demands of the real sector. In this context quality primary, secondary and tertiary education will
Page 19

become progressively more important. Achievements of some of the MDGs (such as maternal
mortality rate and the proportion of births attended by a skilled person) will also require a
renewed focus on health care quality. Delivering quality services will in turn require
continued efforts to build the capacity of the public service, both its institutions and its
human resources. Decentralization will need to be deepened including by providing adequate
resources especially for capital investments, and by allowing regions and woredas to exercise
discretion in their utilization.
54.
To address these key challenges and succeed in meeting the GTP goals of reducing
poverty and becoming a middle income country within a decade Ethiopia will need to succeed
in transforming its economy in at least the following four dimensions:





Increased productivity and competitiveness of the industrial and services sectors for rapid
and sustained job creation (GTP pillars 3 and 4);
Transformation to modern and productive agriculture (GTP pillar 2);
Strengthened systems to better respond to shocks and increase resilience (GTP pillar 5); and,
Improved government effectiveness (GTP pillar 6).

The Government needs to pursue these objectives concurrently, as strong synergies exist
between them.
55.
Experiences from a range of countries indicate that economic growth cannot be
sustained unless there is also a structural transformation where people move from
subsistence agriculture to higher productivity activities.42 New and diverse job opportunities
in urban, peri-urban and rural areas will draw the excess of unemployed and underemployed
population (mostly youth) from overpopulated rural settings to where their skills can be utilized
more productively. However, lowering population pressure on land will not on its own be
sufficient to transform subsistence agriculture into modern and more productive agriculture.
Complementary efforts are needed to diversify livelihoods, as well as to enhance agricultural
growth (e.g., provision of key public infrastructure, stable regulatory framework, private sector
engagement, leveraging mobile technologies to enhance productivity of farmers and businesses).
Improving the effectiveness of GoE support will also be critical so that it can effectively and
efficiently promote the transformation process through direct and indirect interventions. GoE
also has a key role to play in providing basic social services (e.g., health and education), which
will underpin people’s ability to respond positively to new opportunities. In time, this virtuous
circle will enhance social cohesion by creating positive economic and social spillovers for
individuals as well as the country. Finally, as the urbanization process accelerates, important
challenges will need to be addressed, such as adequate planning at the municipal level, and the
provision of adequate infrastructure (especially transport and energy), housing and other
services. In the absence of such provision, rising urbanization will lead to poverty, the creation of
slums, and deteriorating environmental quality.

Broad-based economic growth in all sectors of the economy will, in the long term,
lead to a sustainable enhancement of resilience and reduction of vulnerabilities of the
Ethiopian people. Since the 1990s GoE and its development partners have sought to meet the
challenge of food insecurity primarily through investments that directly targeted a large,
chronically food insecure population. These programs have demonstrated benefits to bridge food
gaps, reduce asset depletion, increase resilience to shocks, and modestly diversify and increase
income. However experience to date suggests that sustainable graduation from food insecurity
cannot be expected to be achieved with only safety net participation and limited assistance from
food security focused interventions; it will require a more comprehensive support including
programs that focus on increasing agricultural productivity, access to microcredit as well as
improved delivery and quality of social services (especially health and education). While there
is a need for a comprehensive social protection system that allows GoE to manage risks and
respond to disasters (and indeed social transfers may be necessary for the chronic poor), for the
majority of the population diversification of livelihoods and employment opportunities, in both
rural and urban areas, and a comprehensive approach to agricultural growth, in both low
potential and high potential areas, offers the only viable and sustainable solution to foodinsecurity in the medium- to long-term.
A.

Job Creation through Increased Productivity and Competitiveness

57.
Ethiopia needs to urgently address the needs of a rapidly increasing job-seeking
population through accelerated growth of off-farm employment and labor intensive
industries. Around 85 percent of Ethiopia's population depends on small-holder agriculture,
mostly in subsistence farming. Rural population growth is leading to a decreasing average size
of holdings resulting in an increasing number of households for which subsistence farming is no
longer a viable way of life. However, many young men and women in rural communities have
limited or no formal employment prospects. This challenge will persist in the context of a high
population growth rate. In addition, thousands of students graduating from universities and
colleges have aspirations of not returning to their parents’ farms, but instead moving into urban
and peri-urban areas, to look for jobs. Between 2 and 2.5 million young people are entering the
labor market every year. This contrasts with a total of 2.5 million people in paid employment in
2011, of which only 1.5 million were employed in the formal private sector. During the GTP
period, the number of young people entering the urban labor market will be almost ten times the
number of people retiring (CSA, 2011). As Ethiopia aspires to become a middle income country,
urbanization is therefore not just inevitable, but it is also a key factor in delivering economic
growth.43
58.
To maintain GDP growth at double digits and create new jobs, industrial and
export-led growth is critical, as appropriately acknowledged by the GTP (p.22).44 Accordingly
during 2010-15 industrial growth is expected to double (from 10 to 20 percent) and export
growth to accelerate from 12.5 to 19.4 percent. This will lead to a higher contribution of
manufacturing to GDP and a larger share of light manufacturing in exports (currently 5.5 and 9
43

As the 2009 World Development Report shows, no developed country has reached its current per capita income
without the advantages of urbanization and vibrant cities.
44
Agriculture sector is also singled out as a major source of growth, which is the focus of section B below.

percent respectively). The GTP (p.56-60) defines a two-pronged approach to ensuring faster and
sustained development of the industrial sector. The main strategic direction is to support
expansion and development of micro and small enterprises (MSEs), as well as to promote the
establishment of medium and large scale firms.45 Secondly, a special focus will be given to five
sectors which, based on recent analysis, capitalize on the country’s endowment and comparative
advantage: textiles and garments; leather and leather products; sugar and related products;
cement; and the metal and engineering industry.46 In addition, GTP identifies tourism sector as a
source of job creation particularly for MSEs and women (Box 2).
59.
GoE’s focus on job creation is well-placed reflecting a challenge faced by
Governments across the globe. In this context the 2013 World Development Report (WDR)
highlights that jobs are at the center of three transformations: living standards, productivity and
social cohesion. Across the world jobs are a key source of household income and a prerequisite
for poverty reduction. Employment growth is compatible with productivity growth as more
productive jobs are created at the expense of less productive ones. Clustering of firms,
participation in international and regional trade, and foreign investment all bring new ideas and
support knowledge spillovers and specialization. However, while micro- and small enterprises
account for the bulk of job creation in developing countries, they also account for the bulk of job
destruction, resulting in job “churn” but not growth. Finally, jobs are more than just earnings and
benefits as they are the main source of satisfaction with life and employment status across
regions. In conclusion, jobs have important spillover effects – both economic and social for
individuals as well as a broadly defined community.47

Supporting enterprises across all sizes and sectors will be critical in creating new
jobs in Ethiopia. According to the preliminary results of the 2012 World Bank Enterprise
Survey for Ethiopia,48 during FY2008-10 Ethiopia experienced an overall employment growth
45

Small enterprises employ 5-19 people; medium 20-99 people; large employ more than 100 people.
In addition the GTP also singles out the chemical and pharmaceutical industry.
47
Regarding social cohesion, jobs have an important role to play in terms of improving the well-being of
individuals, influencing values and behaviors, and connecting people of different social and ethnic backgrounds thus
increasing tolerance.
48
This analysis is based on 2011-12 WB Enterprise Survey. Data collected thus far covered 301 firms located in
Addis Ababa: 149 manufacturing and 152 services firms. Since the survey was still ongoing at the time of writing,
weights, which are indispensable in making assertions about the whole economy, have not yet been computed.

rate of 11.1 percent.49 Among enterprises, small firms had the highest employment growth rate
of 14.4 percent, while medium and large firms experienced growth rate of 9.5 and 2 percent
respectively. Firms in services had slightly higher employment growth (12 percent) compared to
firms in manufacturing (10 percent). In terms of job creation, medium-sized firms generated 45
percent of the total of new jobs, while small firms generated almost as many new jobs as large
firms (Figure 5). 50 However large firms remain the main contributor to total employment (78
percent of total jobs in 2010) compared to medium firms which contributed 15 percent of total
employment in the same period.

While there are many ongoing initiatives in Ethiopia to promote labor intensive industries
(e.g., recent success stories in the footwear and garment industries), in order for Ethiopia to
rapidly create jobs in the manufacturing sector a more systematic approach to investments
is needed. This would require GoE to tackle several structural and regulatory challenges. Recent
analytical work on Africa’s manufacturing experience, in comparison to China and Vietnam,
provides insights and recommendations for developing Ethiopia’s light manufacturing and laborintensive industries. Accordingly, the availability and quality of inputs, access to finance and
land seem the most critical constraints to improving competitiveness and accelerating growth in
selected light manufacturing sectors in Ethiopia (Table 4). These results are also corroborated by
the 2012 WB Enterprise Survey, which highlighted access to finance and land as two critical
constraints across sectors in Ethiopia. Both constraints seem to be more acute for small and
medium size firms. Finally it is important to recognize that frequent and abrupt changes to the

Caution is needed in interpreting the results for the global comparison as results for SSA and global averages are
representative at the country level (i.e. survey weights are used to make inferences).
49
Employment growth is measured as the ratio of the annualized change in employment over the average
employment of the initial and final year (Haltiwanger index). This measure reduces the impact of a very low initial
level of employment, which can produce very high rates of growth (i.e., a firm that grows employment from 1 to 10,
would render a 900 percent growth rate). Employment growth rate is measured over FY 2008-10.
50
Contribution to job creation is computed as the share of different sub-population groups (e.g. small, medium and
large firms or manufacturing and services firms) to net job creation, where job creation is the change in the number
of permanent, full-time employees between FY08-10. Changes in employment are derived by aggregating the
changes reported by each firm in the sample. Size is defined using 2008 as the baseline year. Contribution to
employment is computed as the share of different sub-population groups to total employment, where total
employment is the number of permanent, full-time employees in 2010 and derived by aggregating the employment
reported by each firm in the sample. Size is defined using 2010 as the base year.

regulatory framework heighten the perception of risk in the country and may negatively affect
decisions by domestic as well as foreign investors.
62.
GoE has shown strong interest in addressing these key obstacles by implementing a
range of financial and non-financial instruments. As part of a broader industrial and trade
development strategy, the GTP (p.61) plans to establish Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as a
platform for catalyzing diversification, upgrading and growth. Similarly, to promote the Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector, GoE intends to facilitate development of
industrial clusters, which would connect firms in a particular field with links to related
institutions such as financial providers, educational institutions, and various levels of
government. 51 These initiatives aim to enable firms to overcome constraints in the areas of
capital, skills, technology, and logistics as well as to grow and compete by fostering production
value chains and achieving efficiency gains. 52 To ensure that the SEZ platform energizes
MSMEs along with FDI and larger domestic investors, the Government recognizes that policies
to support effective links between local SMEs and the globally-competitive firms anchored in the
zones will be critical. Since specialized lending to MSMEs typically comes at a relatively later
stage of banking sector development, GoE is considering using lines of credit as effective tools
to build capacity in the banking sector and to improve access to finance by MSMEs.
Simultaneously, there is a need for capacity building,53 financial infrastructure development54
and a proper corporate governance framework, so that commercial banks (state and private) can
play their intermediation function in financing MSMEs (GTP, p.62).
63.
While Government’s efforts to alleviate some of the key constraints facing light
manufacturing through the establishment of SEZs and clustering of firms are commendable, the
importance of strengthening the regulatory environment that will encourage
entrepreneurship and innovation, and enhance earning opportunities for the vast majority
working in the formal and informal sectors cannot be overstated. Successful implementation
of the GTP is predicated on finding a path to sustain its very high financing requirements. 55
Attracting more private inflows (domestic and FDI) into the targeted sectors will play an
important role in leveraging public resources. However, as most jobs in Ethiopia are created by
new and usually small enterprises, creating a positive overall business environment for the
MSMEs operating in “other” sectors is critical to unleashing their potential, improving their
productivity and facilitating their transition from informal-to-formal status (Box 1). Failure to do
so would constitute a missed opportunity. In this context, improving registration, licensing,
taxation and trade logistics seems to be of particular importance.56 Strengthening public-private

In this context MSE development also contributes to the GoE’s efforts to increase the economic empowerment of
women, and the development of small scale income generating activities for women is a specific aim of the GTP.

Such as tailoring information requirements and monitoring practices to MSME clients; using credit scoring
techniques in lieu of collateral; developing innovative ways of lending, including using stock as collateral, order

partnership and dialogue can also greatly contribute to GoE’s job creation agenda (Box 5 in
Chapter III).
Box 1: Entry and operation constraints to MSMEs
Registration: currently businesses need to renew their license every year as a commercial registration for the whole life span
of a business does not exist. Moreover, there is a requirement to inform the register every time a registered business starts
carrying out commercial activities in a new location as well as for permit for expansion and upgrading. Initial capital
requirements for limited liability companies also represent a barrier to entry. Integration of commercial and tax registrations,
introduction of the principle of the validity of commercial registration for the whole life span of a business, substituting annual
renewal with annual information update would address some of these constraints.
Licensing: the lack of a unique “license to sell” for all registered business implies that businesses are required to comply with
different licensing requirements (including the requirement for obtaining an export/import license) leading to an excessive and
costly administrative burden.
Taxation: uncertainty related to the basis of criteria and turnover proxies used for the presumptive taxation for “small”
taxpayers (Category C) below the 100,000 ETB/year (about US$5,860/year) represent another significant barrier to MSME
development. Appeals system is perceived to be costly and have limited independence.
Trade logistics: currently a large number of declarations and supporting documents are required for border clearance
(import/export) leading to costly trade logistics (higher inland transport cost, higher port and terminal handling fees, letters of
credit). Recognizing the poor performance in this regard, Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority is currently taking
encouraging reform initiatives including the enactment of a new Customs Proclamation that is expected to improve the
import/export environment in Ethiopia and streamline the documentation process.

64.
Regional integration and the boosting of intra-regional trade can play a critical role
in driving productivity and growth over a sustained period as happened in East Asia in the
1980s and 1990s and recently in China. As correctly noted by the GTP (p.63-64), implementing
a less restrictive and more efficient trading regime would help Ethiopia deepen regional trade
integration in goods and services within the African continent and beyond. There is substantial
potential for Ethiopia to increase its share in regional trade, especially with the East African
Community (EAC), the fastest growing regional group in the World after ASEAN. In 2010 only
0.3 percent of Ethiopia’s export went to the EAC, compared to Uganda’s 20 percent. GoE’s
plans to implement measures that would help Ethiopia’s light-manufacturing industry become
more competitive internationally would also improve its regional competitiveness. In addition, it
may be worthwhile exploring the possibility of Ethiopia participating in regional supply chains
and how this might encourage inward FDI. Ethiopia can also play an important role in crossborder trade in agricultural products (paragraph 77). Regarding services, a recent World Bank
study found that Ethiopia had the most restrictive trade policy in the services sector of 78
developing and transition countries sampled (financial services, telecommunications,
professional and retail distributions).57 Exports of services appear to be of particular importance
for land-locked countries, such as Ethiopia, for whom opportunities to diversify into the export
of manufactures are more limited by the high costs of transporting goods.
65.
Entrepreneurship and technical skills development and technology upgrading are
critical for rapid expansion of all firms, regardless of their size and sector. In order to
improve firms’ productivity and competitiveness, it is important to adopt new and more efficient
technologies and ensure the quality of products. To do so, a skilled and semi-skilled labor force
is necessary. Unfortunately, currently the availability of training is limited and its quality is often
low. 58 Institutions mandated with provision of training (e.g., Regional State Micro & Small
57

Only 7 percent of all MSEs have access to training (Ethiopia Development and Research Institute EDRI, 2004)
and training is not tailored well to the needs of managers (Triodos Facet 2011, Grunder 2010).
58

Page 25

Enterprises Development Agency (REMSEDA), Technical and Vocational Education and
Training (TVET) institutions and One Stop Shops) lack understanding and appreciation of
demand driven approaches. While it is important to build their capacity, as planned under the
GTP (p.86-91), it is equally important to shift towards market based approaches and partnership
with industry so that firms’ demands for aptly skilled labor are met. Support is also necessary to
strengthen three government technical institutes mandated to provide technical support and
technology transfer to selected manufacturing industries with high potential for export, income
and employment growth (e.g., the Textile Industry Development Institute, the Leather
Development Institute and the Metal Industry Development Institute). Upgrading of the institutes
can benefit MSEs through transfer of technology and technical assistance especially to
strengthen the clusters in the cities. In addition to specialized training, GTP (p.86-91)
recognizes the importance of improving quality of education, especially secondary and
tertiary discussed in paragraph 81 below.
Box 2: Tourism sector – an untapped source of jobs
Tourism sector in Ethiopia can become an important source of jobs benefitting many poor, particularly SMEs, women, and
youth. Currently, the hotels and restaurants subsector alone employs over 408,000 people in urban areas compared to 22,000
people employed in leather industry and 35,000 in floriculture (CSA, 2011). Close to 88 percent of the people employed in
restaurants and hotels are women, about 60 percent are self-employed, and more than 50 percent are less than 30 years old.
Ethiopia’s craft sector has the highest impact potential in terms of poverty reduction, with 55 percent of tourist expenditure
benefiting poor households (ODI 2009). Ethiopia has clear advantages as the “All-of-Africa” in one country destination with
a good mix of unspoiled culture and nature resources; it has a reputation as a safe and secure destination; and it has good
opportunities to build on complementarities with well marketed neighboring countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Djibouti.
Ethiopian Airlines offers good accessibility and competitive air fares. Addis Ababa is quickly becoming a diplomatic capital
and a major regional hub for air transport.
The GTP recognizes this potential and establishes ambitious targets for the tourism sector including doubling of tourism
arrivals (to 1 million) and a twelve-fold increase of tourists´ expenditures (to Birr 3bn) during 2010-15. In order to achieve
these goals, Ethiopia needs to address challenges related to the tourism-related regulatory framework and business
environment; institutional management capacity; and cross-sectoral linkages. The WBG, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Culture and Tourism, is actively supporting the implementation of the 2009 National Tourism Development Policy. Through
the Ethiopia Sustainable Tourism Development Program and policy dialogue supported by the recently published analysis
“Ethiopia’s Tourism Sector: Strategic Paths to Competitiveness and Job Creation” (June 2012). IFC is currently organizing a
Tourism Public-Private Dialogue Forum and is also planning to increase its investment activity in the sector.

66.
Addressing gender inequality and gaps in women’s and men’s development
opportunities will help advance the Government’s job creation agenda. Global experience
indicates that including women in economic activities brings substantial benefits to growth.59
According to recent analysis, reducing gender inequalities in education and the labor market
could increase the annual GDP growth in Ethiopia by 1.9 percentage points (World Bank, 2008).
However, currently women in Ethiopia are mainly responsible for household duties; they lack
economic opportunities, they have limited involvement in cash crop production, non-farm
enterprises, and wage employment; and they face much larger barriers to doing business than
men do. The unemployment rate among females is more than twice as large as that of males in
59

See Appendix 6 for detailed analysis.

Page 26

urban areas, so they are less experienced and the wage gap between men and women with a
similar background, doing the same job, is around 50 percent. Tourism sector, which offers
significant employment opportunities for women, is still relatively underdeveloped although
GoE is taking important steps in promoting the sector (Box 2). There is also a pronounced
gender gap in access to and control of productive resources. Although women contribute much
of the agricultural labor, their access to land continues to be limited despite joint land
certification efforts.
67.
Government’s focus on the job creation agenda through industrialization will
inevitably lead to acceleration of urbanization. According to the most recent data, about 14
million Ethiopians lived in urban areas in 2011 (up from 9.8 million in 2000), of which about 3
million live in Addis Ababa.60 The annual growth rate of the urban population is 4.3 percent and
by 2020 cities are projected to be home to 20 percent of Ethiopia’s population. 61 The urban
economy is emerging as a major driver of growth: urban areas are estimated to now account for
close to 50 percent of GDP and about 60 percent of growth in GDP.62 However, for Ethiopia to
realize the benefits of urbanization important challenges need to be addressed including, inter
alia, limited capacity of urban local governments in the area of planning and budgeting;
expansion and maintenance of good quality of infrastructure; and delivery of basic social
services (GTP, p.24).
68.
Despite good progress in improving access to infrastructure (as discussed in Chapter I)
power disruptions and shortages, and high transport costs were identified among the top
ten obstacles to firms’ growth and job expansion.63 To address problems related to electricity
(Table 5) and to keep up with the expected 25 percent per year growth of domestic demand for
electricity, GoE’s Energy Sector Strategy envisages ambitious expansion of grid and off-grid
connectivity 64 to 75 percent of towns and villages and to double the number of consumers
connected to the grid to 4 million by 2015. The high cost of the planned energy sector investment
program under the GTP (estimated at US$11bn, of which US$3.5bn has already been raised
mostly through short term bonds) has created financial viability challenges for EEPCO, and will
create an additional burden of about US$2bn on GoE’s budget in FY2012-20 (cumulatively)
which is equivalent to 3-4 percent of GoE’s annual budget expenditure. GoE, therefore, needs to
develop and implement a medium term program of revenue enhancement and/or debt
restructuring for EEPCO. Efficiency improvements (by reducing system losses) also may
contribute, but only modestly, since operational efficiency gains would improve the financial
performance by only about 1-2%. In addition, EEPCO needs to modernize its operations and
build its capacity by investing in human resources and training in order to be capable of handling

Ethiopia has vast potential renewable energy resources (about 45,000 MW hydro; 10,000
MW geothermal and 5,000 MW wind potential). GOE intends to become the power hub of
East Africa and play a critical role in the East Africa Power Pool (EAPP) area, where
demand is expected to increase by 69 percent over the next 10 years. Realization of this ambition
requires organizational structures that can help plan and implement cross-border interconnection
facilities, harmonize operational rules of practice for interconnected national power grids, and
put in place a transparent, fair, and viable commercial framework for cross-border trading in
energy services. Such trade will put East Africa on a cleaner development path in terms of
carbon emissions and will also help balance loads when other renewable energy resources, such
as concentrated solar and geothermal energy, are deployed on a large scale. Effective and viable
modern utilities will be essential to support timely and effective implementation of these large
investment projects.
70.
For the past decade the Government, in collaboration with other partners (including the
World Bank), has been heavily investing in expansion of the road network and to reform and
modernize the sector in accordance with the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP). The
GTP (p.68) reconfirms GoE’s commitment to increase the size and quality of the road
network to keep pace with rising demand and sets out ambitious targets. So far donors have
mainly focused on federal roads (e.g., regional arterial and link roads). However, there is a great
need for improved infrastructure and efficiencies within the rural and community road networks.
To that end the Universal Rural Road Access Program (URRAP), one of the largest public works
programs in Ethiopia, is focusing on building the necessary rural road networks and at the same
time generating employment opportunities, both for skilled and unskilled labor. The Ethiopian
Road Authority, which is responsible for overall network planning, road development and
coordination in the country, needs capacity support so that the timeliness and quality of road
construction projects is improved.

International best practices show that a vibrant local ICT industry creates jobs,
improves productivity and fosters innovation.65 The National ICT for Development (ICT4D)
Action Plan for Ethiopia (2006-10) aims to build an ICT-driven economy. While some progress
has been achieved, GoE should consider leveraging opportunities presented in the global and
domestic IT-based services market for the Ethiopian economy. To facilitate this process, steps
need to be undertaken to improve policy, legal, regulatory and institutional framework; facilitate
development of a highly skilled talent pool and adaptation to new technologies; and improving
access to finance and ICT infrastructure.
B.

Transformation to Modern and Productive Agriculture

72.
Agriculture is Ethiopia’s largest area of private sector activity and a major source
of economic growth. The sector employs the vast majority of Ethiopians, makes up most of the
country’s exports, and is at the center of Ethiopia’s development challenges, whether related to
poverty and food security or to the environment, natural resources management and climate
change (as discussed in paragraphs 25 and 26). Rapid industrialization and urbanization will be
necessary to achieve Ethiopia’s growth goals, but the dominance of agriculture in the economy
and employment–combined with high population growth–means that the performance of the
sector will remain central to overall growth and poverty reduction for many years to come.
73.
The GTP (p.45) sets out GoE’s intention to transform the sector from subsistence to
more market-led production. Notwithstanding high growth rates over past years, agricultural
productivity is still at low levels and most of the food produced on the farm remains consumed
by the farm household. Transformation requires a significant increase in agricultural production,
driven by an increase in productivity, as well as development of more effective and efficient
markets. Building on experience with the implementation of previous strategies, 66 the GTP
(p.45-55) outlines a three-pronged approach: (i) small-holder agriculture development, the
mainstay of Ethiopia agriculture, dominating overall production and employment; (ii) pastoral
development; and (iii) large-scale commercial farming development (including horticulture).
Agricultural commercialization is reflected in an emphasis that increased agricultural production
can provide the inputs for the development of agro-based industries as well as being a basis for
becoming commercially viable in international markets.
74.
Farms, businesses and smallholder farmers have needs similar to MSEs and face
similar constraints to their growth, such as limited access to markets, land, finance, and skills
and technology (as discussed in paragraphs 60-64).67 Therefore, addressing these constraints and
creating a favorable regulatory environment would also benefit farming as a business (whether
small- or large-scale), agribusiness and other related sectors, thereby impacting the profitability
of primary agriculture itself. However, agriculture would also require reforms in areas
specific to the sector including seeds, soil fertility and fertilizer, and the role and functioning of
65

Every single job created in IT-based services is estimated to create indirect employment for 3 to 4 people in other
sectors. Everest analysis; National Association of Software and Services Companies , NASSCOM, 2011

Namely, the long-standing Agricultural Development-Led Industrialization (ADLI) Strategy and the previous
five-year development strategy, PASDEP.

Although some of the constraints are exacerbated given factors such as remoteness from financial center with
services, high risks and seasonality of production, or weak land administration and management.

Page 29

cooperatives. To address these issues, in 2010 GoE established an Agricultural Transformation
Agency (ATA). This new institution, in close coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, is
working on some of the most crucial reform areas specific to agriculture as well as new
initiatives to form public-private partnerships that encourage agribusinesses to invest and source
from smallholder farmers.
75.
Land is a factor of the business environment which is especially important for
agriculture. For most farmers user rights to land is their biggest asset or production factor. As
has been shown globally and for Ethiopia, land tenure security and the ease with which user
rights can be transferred are important determinants of investments into agriculture. Ethiopia has
remarkable land resources, but land is scarce in most of the densely populated highlands, and
under threat from serious land degradation. More land for cultivation is available in other parts of
the country, but the expansion of agriculture in these areas will require careful management to
address serious social and environmental risks associated with it. The management of communal
land – including pastoral land – including the protection of communal land rights is also critical
for the return and sustainability of these resources.
76.
Domestically, although cooperatives play a crucial role in input markets, the direct or
indirect influence of the Government in key areas such as seeds, fertilizer, breeds and other
agricultural inputs undermines competition and thus innovation and effectiveness. The agrodealer sector, a vibrant part of most rural economies in Africa, is small and underdeveloped in
Ethiopia. While GoE’s strategy strengthens the uptake of agricultural inputs and technological
innovations, the private sector role in these activities has so far been limited. Recent initiatives,
however, to involve agribusiness enterprises, including international ones, through public-private
partnerships (PPPs) promise to change this situation over time. These PPPs can strengthen
agricultural value chains from the farm producer to the consumer of food and other agricultural
products. Linking farmers to markets through such supply chains will be critical in transforming
Ethiopian agriculture from subsistence to production. This requires re-thinking and strengthening
of producer organizations, in particular cooperatives, and the promotion of linkages between
smallholders and larger commercial farms. ICT, primarily mobile technology, could also provide
a useful platform to enhance productivity of farmers by delivering just in-time extension
services, weather and market prices information and connecting them to external markets as well
as to facilitate more effective seeds and fertilizer management, tracking the distribution.
77.
Great benefits for the agricultural sector can also be realized through international
trade in the context of regional collaboration. Improved cross-border trade in agricultural
products is particularly important given the problems of food security in the region and the
demand for food staples from growing urban centers. Although a member of COMESA, Ethiopia
only partially participates in the Free Trade Agreement and has not reached agreement with
neighboring countries on the COMESA Simplified Trade Regime, which is designed to grant
simplified certificates of origin to an agreed list of products to enable them enjoy duty and quota
free access. Barriers to trade along the value chain prevent Ethiopia from realizing its potential in
the agriculture sector. For example, it is estimated that in Ethiopia only about one quarter of the
demand for improved seed is being satisfied. But the use of improved hybrid maize could

Page 30

quadruple productivity. Even if just half the farmers achieved the productivity associated with
using hybrid seeds, domestic production could replace commercial imports.68
78.
Commercial agriculture is a challenging business, requiring knowledge in areas as
diverse as agronomy, economics, finance, and marketing as well as project management.
Consequently, the needs to be addressed by the research, education and extension systems are
changing. Traditional agricultural research, which mainly focuses on crops, needs to diversity
and specialize at the same time. It also needs to be complemented with an education system that
teaches future farmers and other professionals working in the sector relevant skills. Finally, it
requires an extension system that provides diversified and specialized information and
knowledge on demand. Consequently, these agricultural innovation systems need to evolve from
ones dominated by a public sector with limited capacity towards a more pluralistic approach, in
which the public sector continues to provide a strong role where needed, but is complemented by
the private sector, either farmer-controlled or through private firms and institutions.
79.
Finally, climate change is particularly important for the agricultural sector as
farmers are most vulnerable to climate change and agriculture (in particular livestock, forests and
soils) has the bulk of the potential to reduce green-house gases (GHG) in Ethiopia. It is estimated
that unless steps to build climate resilience are effective, climate change will reduce Ethiopia’s
GDP growth by between 0.5 and 2.5 percent each year.69 GoE recognizes the importance and
urgency of the situation as well as the country’s significant mitigation potential and aims to put
Ethiopia on a carbon neutral growth trajectory. The Climate Resilience Green Economy (CRGE)
Strategy is based on four pillars including (i) improved crop and livestock practices; (ii) forestry;
(iii) renewable energy; and (iv) “leapfrogging to modern and energy-efficient technologies in
transport, industrial sectors, and buildings.” A major emphasis will be on agriculture and
forestry, which “contribute around 45 percent and 25 percent respectively to projected GHG
emission levels under business-as-usual assumptions and together account for around 80 percent
of the total abatement potential.” Given the ambitious CRGE agenda, changes will be required in
policies, regulations, and institutions as well as program designs and financial support.
C.

Strengthened Systems to Better Respond to Shocks and Increase Resilience

80.
Reducing vulnerability and building resilience to shocks is important for sustainable
economic growth in Ethiopia. While Ethiopia has significant opportunities for transformation
and growth, many Ethiopians are subject to a large number of shocks, which have an immediate
effect of lowering living standards, and in many cases can result in permanent stunting of the
potential intellectual capacity of the next generation of Ethiopians. GoE is currently drafting a
comprehensive National Social Protection Policy that will provide a framework for the
coordination and provision of social protection services in Ethiopia. The Policy recognizes
that effective social protection services contribute to social cohesion and achievement of broader
national socio-economic development and security, making growth more effective equitable. It
aims to address the imbalance in access to basic social services and facilitates investment in

human capital for poor households and communities. The policy commits GoE to prioritize
additional provision for vulnerable groups through programs such as social safety nets,
livelihood schemes, social pensions and those programs addressing inequalities in basic services.
With regard to DRM, GoE’s approach is shifting from response to shocks (saving lives and
livelihoods) and recovery (immediate post-crisis assistance), to a multi-sectoral multi-hazard
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) approach, as outlined in the draft National Policy and
Strategy on Disaster Risk Management (May 2010). Accordingly, in a complete disaster
management cycle more emphasis will be given to prevention, mitigation and preparedness.
Enhancing disaster prevention is facilitated by addressing vulnerabilities and building resilience
to shocks. This can be achieved, inter alia, by enhancing opportunities for income-earning
employment (discussed in Chapter II, section A); improving productivity of agriculture and
shifting towards more sustainable natural resource management (discussed in Chapter II, section
B); and improved social services delivery, especially health and education, discussed below.
81.
Over the past decade access to education services in Ethiopia has expanded considerably
(paragraph 39), but quality of education has been lagging behind. There is commitment from
GoE to improve the quality of education and accordingly there are ongoing programs with the
support of development partners (including WB) complementing GoE efforts. Nevertheless, the
bulk of those who have completed primary education may not have acquired basic literacy and
numeracy.70 In 2010, 38 percent of grade 10 graduates scored below 50 percent - a Ministry of
Education (MOE) benchmark for minimum competency. The low level of education reduces
people’s prospects for finding or creating income-earning jobs and, by default, forces them to
remain in a less-than optimal situation. This also presents opportunity costs. If Ethiopia is to
achieve its goal to become a MIC in a decade, it will require a labor force with a significant share
of secondary school graduates. However, the present situation is far from this goal. In 2010, 56
percent of the labor force did not have schooling, and 29 percent had only primary education.
The problem of low pass rates and achievement levels is associated not only with quality of
teaching and learning but also with the nature of the curriculum. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to reform the secondary curriculum so that it responds better to the skills needed for
employment rather than just focusing on building knowledge for higher education. For primary
education, the focus should be on improving the quality of education and increasing completion
rates.
82.
Similarly, while access to health services has considerably improved, some indicators
remain stubbornly high, such as maternal mortality or chronic under-nutrition. This
demonstrates that access to services, while a necessary condition, is not sufficient. In order to
make progress increased capital investments into the sector and focus on quality are required.
The recent GoE shift under the framework of the latest health sector strategy, HSDP IV, is an
important step in the right direction. The strategy prioritizes the MDGs and emphasizes concrete
results over the next 5 years (2011-15) by identifying a list of high impact health inventions and
measurable performance indicators. The “MDG Fund” is GoE’s mechanism for providing more
resources (government and donor funds) to the health sector, allocating them based on results
and building stronger M&E systems. Finally, for improved quality of services (in health as well
70

According to 2008 National Learning Assessments, 60 percent of those who have completed grade 8 did not
acquire the basic competency in mathematics and English.

Page 32

as education), is it important to ensure that the woreda-level platforms for service delivery rest
on solid foundations of fiduciary, administrative, and information governance, as discussed in
Section D below.
83.
Regarding disaster mitigation the focus will be on minimizing potential disaster impacts
through a flexible social safety net mechanism that can quickly scale up when crisis hits and
scale down when it abates. During the recent 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia was
one of the few cases where a scalable safety net under the WB-funded PSNP was in place with
an early warning system and a risk-financing mechanism, that facilitated increasing the coverage
and volume of support to those in need in a timely manner, thus allowing the country to avoid a
more acute crisis. GoE is also considering social insurance as another possible complementary
mechanism to mitigate the impacts of a disaster on the vulnerable. Finally, GoE is committed to
increase its focus on preparedness through strengthening early warning system, building logistic
capacity, maintaining adequate resource reserves and other precautionary measures.
D.

Increasing Government Effectiveness

84.
For GoE to realize its vision of national and economic transformation and attainment of
middle-income status through broad-based growth with a strong middle class, it needs a
government institutional framework which is effective, staffed by civil servants who are
dedicated to delivering quality services and providing an enabling environment for Ethiopia’s
transformation. The GTP (p.95) fully recognizes this, and sees the establishment of “…
government structures with strong implementation capacity” as one of the key strategic
directions needed to build capacity and establish good governance. The strategy “…aims to
increase the efficiency, effectiveness, accountability and transparency of public sector service
delivery”. Whilst significant progress has been made over the last 20 years in building an
effective state operating through a federal and decentralized architecture, significant challenges
remain.
85.
To secure the GTP’s aim, GoE will need to address severe capacity limitations,
particularly at decentralized level. In terms of service delivery, this has particular implications
on quality. Whilst the overall coverage of basic services has increased, evidenced by sectoral
data presented in previous sections, there remain serious questions about quality across sectors.
Over the medium term this presents significant challenges to developmental effectiveness,
particularly in education, health and agriculture, where potential gains secured by wider coverage
are not fully realized. There are also capacity limitations in important institutions such as ERA
and EEPCO. The limited implementation capacity of these organizations means that often
mandates are not delivered upon, and support to large undertakings in infrastructural
development is often insufficient.
86.
The GTP recognizes the need to continue to address human resource development
systems. This is fully appropriate, and builds on progress already made in civil service reform.
Whilst reforms within the civil service have addressed some issues around functionality and
mandate (through business process reengineering), and are creating a platform for more
performance orientation (through the balanced score card approach) there appear to be human
resource management challenges across the civil service evidenced by significant vacancies, high
Page 33

staff turnover, and apparently movement across the civil service (or ‘churning’). There are
particular challenges in the professions of engineering and accountancy and at decentralized
level, especially in remote woredas. Whilst the phenomenon is not fully understood, it is agreed
that it poses significant risks to the quality of service delivery, and to maintaining the hitherto
positive progress made in civil service reform.
87.
GoE also recognizes the need to further strengthen governmental accountability and
transparency. The GTP notes (p. 97) that it is seeking “… to institutionalize systems ensuring
transparency and accountability throughout the public service so that the attitudes and actions of
civil servants are directed towards serving public interests”. As a result a number of initiatives
relating to access to information, complaint handling, standard setting and the like have been
integrated into the broader programs of civil service reform. Nevertheless, weaknesses in formal
oversight institutions at different levels of government mean that service providers are less likely
to be called to account over deficiencies in either service coverage or service standards. This
applies to parliaments at federal and regional level, woreda councils, the Ombudsman, the AntiCorruption Commission at both federal and regional level, and offices of Auditors General.
Appropriate and strong oversight of the public service and public bodies needs to be in place to
ensure governmental effectiveness.
88.
Related to this, there is a need to continue to address the challenges of corruption.
GoE has, from its outset, shown low tolerance to corruption, and the GTP sets out commitments
to better educate civil servants in ethical matters, and to embark on practical measures such as
asset disclosure for political leaders and public officials across all jurisdictions. Nevertheless
there is a public perception that petty corruption, particularly at the point of service delivery, is
rising (evidenced by Ethiopia’s Second National Corruption Survey, Federal Ethics and Anticorruption Commission of Ethiopia FEACC, 2012). Effective measures need to be put in place to
dispel these concerns, otherwise significant damage might be inflicted on the credibility of public
administrations, particularly at decentralized level. Mobile and internet enabled platforms can
serve as effective mechanisms for government to disclose information to a greater number of
citizens, deliver new, innovative services, and allow for faster feedback from its citizens,
including on the cases of corruption.
89.
Having in place a robust PFM system is vitally important for improving the use of
and accountability over public funds as well as service delivery. This is recognized in the
GTP as one of its fundamental governance objectives, to “… establish an effective, efficient,
transparent, accountable and modern governmental financial management system”. The GTP
recognizes that while much has already been achieved in this area, a basic platform has been
built on which a lot more needs to be built, including starting the next generation of PFM
reforms in Ethiopia through developing a comprehensive PFM Action Plan, establishing the
regulatory institutions that will manage the introduction and implementation of international
standards of accounting and auditing, building tax institutions so that they can achieve the GTP
target of doubling to tax to GDP ratio, improving cash management, addressing the weak
control environment in the country through nascent internal audit systems and weak
procurement, as well as structuring the ad hoc PFM training as it currently exists to deliver better
value for money. While improvements have been made in financial transparency and

Page 34

accountability through citizen’s empowerment, more needs to be done regarding legislative
scrutiny of the budget and parliamentary oversight.
90.
A strong commitment to federalism and decentralization remains central to GoE’s
state-building agenda. The establishment of a federal structure in the constitution of 1995 has
subsequently been augmented by ongoing programs of decentralization, which have given
woredas more powers and gradually pushed significant service delivery through kebeles.
Commitment to this approach is not without its challenges; the issues of capacity, state
effectiveness, PFM, oversight and regulation are all made more complex and demanding against
the decentralized agenda. There is still work to be done with respect to some aspects of the
architecture if regions and woredas are to deliver on the mandates envisaged for them, including
issues around revenue assignment. The recent introduction of the MDG Fund by the federal
government in its budget for FY12, where (in all but Somali and Afar regions) regional
governments will manage capital expenditure on programs at woreda level, may have
implications for the woreda-level government.
91.
Another essential component of Ethiopia’s transformation process is greater public
participation in policy making and the holding of governmental administrations and agencies to
popular account. In Ethiopia there is no long-standing culture of citizens holding government to
account. GoE’s philosophy that development is not possible without popular participation is
clearly stated in the GTP (p. 97) which notes that “… public participation is central to ensuring
citizens’ own development and to the success of good governance initiatives… Citizens
participate in development processes by expressing their demands and aspirations and so
contribute to formulating policies and strategies, and to planning, monitoring and evaluation
activities.” Some progress in this area has already been made with initiatives such as the Good
Governance Package and the Financial Transparency and Accountability (FTA), which have
been a vehicle for building popular policy consensus. However, a difficulty moving forward will
be to ensure ongoing participation of Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and other bodies
which might foster the demand for good governance.

III.

Review of the Past WBG Assistance

92.
As part of CPS preparation, the Ethiopia Country Team has prepared two documents that
provided a retrospective view into the program implemented under the previous CAS; namely
(i) a Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) for the period FY08-12
(Appendix 4), and (ii) a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) covering FY09-mid
FY12.
93.
The CAS aimed to help sustain the “dual take-off” of growth and basic services by
supporting the implementation of key elements of GoE’s Plan for Accelerated and Sustained
Development to End Poverty (PASDEP, 2005-10). The CAS had four main strategic pillars: (i)
fostering economic growth, in order to help sustain the emerging economic “take-off”; (ii)
improving access to and quality of basic service delivery, in order to sustain the emerging basic
service “take-off”; (iii) reducing Ethiopia’s vulnerability to help improve prospects for
sustainability; and (iv) fostering improved governance with continued emphasis on institutional
capacity building to support the first three strategic objectives and citizens’ empowerment.
Page 35

Overall, the CAS CR rated the performance of the CAS program Moderately Satisfactory; CAS
outcomes were fully achieved only under pillar three, “Reducing Vulnerability”; outcomes under
all other pillars were rated as partially achieved. Box 3 provides a short description of successful
and innovative projects during the CAS period. The CAS CR drew the following lessons
applicable to the Bank’s program under the new CPS:
CAS Focus
 The Bank needs to find ways to engage more effectively with GoE in policy dialogue on
macroeconomic and private and financial sector issues through increasing the relevance of
the Bank’s economic and sector work, offering the Government a menu of instruments
available from across the World Bank Group (including the International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)) and
strengthening partnerships. In this context, bridging the data and knowledge gap for
evidence-based dialogue is key.
 There is a need for a more comprehensive and sustainable solution for food security. Thus,
while the Bank should continue to support and strengthen social protection systems and
invest in disaster risk management programs, it should also strengthen its support to GoE to
increase opportunities for on and off-farm employment (including by supporting private
sector and agribusiness).
 The Bank needs to more actively engage in improving the quality of basic services. A newly
approved instrument – Program for Results – might provide a good opportunity to support
this shift.
CAS Design and Implementation
 Monitoring the CAS results framework more regularly will help maintain realistic targets and
flag deficiencies in outcome indicators. There should be better linkages between lending and
non-lending instruments as well as with the indicators and the CAS outcomes.
 The Bank should be ready to resume budget support under the new CPS as it provides an
important forum for dialogue, enhances donor harmonization, and reduces transaction costs.
Despite the successful shift in financing modalities from budget support to Provision of Basic
Services Program (PBS) in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget support have not
been fully replicated by PBS.
 The CPS should promote scaling up of successful programmatic approaches as they leverage
greater resources from partners, disburse faster, and have greater flexibility.
94.
The CPPR (FY09-mid FY12) focused on key cross-cutting implementation and fiduciary
issues; examined the quality of the project results frameworks and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) systems; and recommended specific short and medium-to-long-term actions to be
implemented or initiated under the CPS.71 The following key cross-cutting and fiduciary issues
were identified that affect the quality and riskiness of the Ethiopia portfolio:

71

In addition, a separate consultancy has been commissioned out to evaluate application of safeguard policies
(environmental and social) across the Ethiopia portfolio, but the results have not been finalized at the time of the
CPS writing.

Page 36

Cross-cutting issues
 The most critical cross-cutting issue by far is the high and rapid staff turnover (including
difficulties in attracting adequately skilled staff as well as their retention). It affecting the
majority of projects in the Ethiopia portfolio and contributing to a slower than optimal pace
of implementation and disbursements. This exacerbates already weak capacity at many levels
of Government and across sectors, especially in the areas of financial management and
procurement, but also in project management.
 Low ownership, slow implementation and weak follow-up at regional level due to limited
early-on involvement of the regional counterparts in project preparation, implementation and
monitoring.72
 Insufficient sharing of knowledge and experience within the Bank, between the Bank and
GoE and between project implementation agencies.
Fiduciary risk in Bank projects
 The fiduciary risk of the portfolio is “High”. The main reasons for these ratings, in addition
to the cross-cutting issues identified above, arise from systemic weaknesses, the
ineffectiveness of internal controls and internal audit, late financial reporting, inadequate
capacity, significant unaccounted advances at various levels of implementation, long delays
in bank reconciliations, insufficient controls over the usage of government property,
excessive cash balances and lack of follow up on audit findings. The situation is further
exacerbated by high staff turnover (over 25 percent on an annual basis at the woreda level),
low fiduciary capacity and appointment of people to management positions without adequate
financial management training. While the timeliness of reporting has improved, there are
concerns regarding the quality of the information contained in these reports.
 In the area of procurement, in addition to a lack of staff with the right skills and experience at
all levels, there are weaknesses in contract management capacity especially in the
infrastructure sector (i.e., roads, power and water). Different and inconsistent procurement
standards at the regions further increases the risk of misprocurement. The disconnect
between the Work Plans and Procurement Plans results in ineffective procurement practices
during implementation particularly at the Regional and woreda levels and delays in
procurement actions.
95.
In addition, intensive consultations have been undertaken to gain a broad-based
perspective on the Bank’s performance and future priorities. A Client Survey was conducted
soliciting inputs from close to 330 respondents. Workshops and discussion foras have been
organized in Addis Ababa as well as in four regions (Oromya, Tigray, Amhara and SNNP); faceto-face consultations were organized with federal and regional government officials, private
sector, CSOs, academia, sectoral and thematic associations and development partners; and a
meeting with Ethiopian Diaspora was organized in Washington, DC. In addition, social media,
including a dedicated online consultations facility and country office sites on Facebook and
72

Bank projects under preparation are often mostly discussed at the federal level with MoFED with limited or
minimal upfront consultation with regional stakeholders. Such practice has created the perception that MoFED
limits the role of regions and this has led to low ownership and affected their ability to effectively address project
implementation concerns. The weak implementation follow-up also evolved around the same problem of weak upfront involvement by the region.

Page 37

Twitter were used to reach out to those who were not able to take part in the face to face
consultations. Over 830 people were able to provide their input online. Although the different
stakeholders had various points of views, there were also areas of consensus, including:73
i)

The majority of stakeholders indicated that Ethiopia has made significant progress towards
achieving the MDGs and that life in general had become better in the last five years.
Nonetheless, the quality of services and quality of people’s lives has not kept pace. Both
public officials as well as citizens at large underlined three reasons for an increasing gap
between the quantity and quality of public services: (i) high and rapid staff turnover at all
levels of government (federal, regional and woreda) coupled with the low capacity of public
servants; (ii) limited space for private sector engagement resulting in over-reliance on public
sector delivery, especially in the delivery of agriculture extension services but also, for
example, the delivery of training; and (iii) significant gender inequalities hindering growth.
Serious concerns also remain regarding macroeconomic stability, especially related to the
eroding effects that high inflation has on people’s wealth and wellbeing. The majority of
participants requested the Bank to undertake a thorough analysis of the issues and to engage
with the Government in addressing them.

ii) Role of the WBG. Participants perceived the Bank as an effective catalyst for discussion on

critical issues related to poverty and growth, including the Bank’s role as a facilitator of
discussions between the government and the private sector (e.g., though the Public-Private
Dialogue Forum (PPDF)); as well as a coordinator among development partners. There was
a demand for the Bank to significantly increase its engagement with the private sector and on
job creation (e.g., MSE agenda, access to finance, PPPs in agriculture and agribusiness, land
management in selected regions) and governance (e.g., citizens’ empowerment and social
accountability; regional and woreda PFM; strengthening legislative and judiciary branch of
the government). Clearly, in addition to finance, the Bank brings a unique combination of
analytical knowledge and round-the-world experience. However, knowledge creation is as
important as its dissemination and both aspects should be strengthened going forward.
Fostering learning and experience sharing should be promoted between Ethiopia and other
countries as well as between regions. Finally, Bank could consider ways to facilitate flow of
knowledge and finance from a large and diverse Ethiopian Diaspora.74
iii) Demand for stronger partnership with the regions. The regions strongly advocated for a

much closer partnership with the Bank going forward, not only during the preparation of the
CPS but also during its implementation. WBG programs should leverage greater emphasis on
73

Also, as part of CPS preparation two workshops have been organized to inform and enrich the design and
implementation of the strategy: GAC in the CAS Workshop in May 2012 and Supporting Job Creation in Ethiopia
Workshop in June 2012.
74
There are two ongoing initiatives that aim to facilitate exchange of knowhow and finance from Diaspora:
Ethiopian Diaspora Health and Education Professionals Mobilization project and IDF Strengthening Capacity for
Mobilizing and Engaging the Ethiopian Diaspora. Further, the WB Payment System Development Group is
providing TA to the Universal Postal Union and the Ethiopian Postal Service under the African Institute for
Remittances (AIR) project on the remittance system that connects post offices worldwide to process money
transfers.

Page 38

the regions’ specific development needs. Broadening the range of stakeholders to include
non-government partners should be promoted. In this context, participants requested both
GoE and development partners to recognize the role CSOs, NGOs and the private sector play
in the development of Ethiopia and thus a need to create space and environment that would
enable for a more meaningful and active partnership in the decision making process.
Continuous support to PPDF was requested.
Box 3: Selected projects under 2008-12 CAS
Urban Local Government Development Project (ULGDP) – how empowered local governments and local communities can
transform cities and generate local employment. ULGDP (IDA $300mln, effective since Nov 2008) supports improved
performance in the planning, delivery and sustained provision of priority municipal services and infrastructure by urban local
governments. The performance-based grant is having a transformative effect on 17 cities in which the project is implemented. For the
first time, these cities have access to transparent, predictable funding, as long as they meet objective performance criteria. Citizen
participation in investment planning has more than doubled in participating cities, and investment plans are now closely aligned with
the expressed priorities of citizens. Quality and timeliness of external audits has dramatically improved. The introduction of
appropriate standards, particularly in the case of labor-intensive cobblestone road construction, has greatly improved access and
drainage while also creating approximately 90,000 of jobs specifically targeted to the urban poor, including women and the disabled.
The Agricultural Growth Program (AGP) – how partnerships can provide basis for strengthened, comprehensive and more
harmonized support to agricultural growth. The AGP (IDA$150mln, effective since March 2011) aims to increase agricultural
productivity and market access in selected relatively high-potential woredas with particular focus on women and youth. This approach
presents an important shift in thinking and support that complements the traditional (and still existing) focus of channeling most
public investments, in particular from donor resources, to directly help the most food-insecure living in the most marginal areas.
While it is too early to have measurable impacts in terms of AGP’s development objectives, the project has already realized several
strategic objectives. First, the participatory planning approach ensures that farmers, in particular women and youth, determine the
development of their communities and themselves. Second, the AGP as a multi-stakeholder program ensures that various government
agencies and DPs, each contribute in a coordinated manner in line with their comparative advantage. As such, the AGP provides a
framework for strengthened, comprehensive and more harmonized support to agricultural growth and a platform for policy
discussions. In addition to creating linkages between agriculture, private sector and market development, AGP supports new
institutional arrangements and private-public partnerships with the aim of integrating small farmers with high-value agricultural
markets.
The Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) – how a flexible instrument can help mitigate the effects of natural disaster.
PSNP (IDA$850mln under APL III) was launched in 2005 to complement the existing humanitarian support system and to assist
chronically food insecure people in rural Ethiopia. The PSNP helps to reduce household vulnerability, improve resilience to shocks
and promote sustainable community development in food insecure areas. To mitigate the risk of economic and climate related shocks
the PSNP has adaptive measures such as soil and water conservation activities, small scale irrigation and integrated watershed
management. In addition the program also supports the Public Work activities to build Social Infrastructure such as schools, health
clinics and roads. The effects of the 2008 food crisis in the Horn of Africa have been mitigated in Ethiopia to a great extent by PSNP,
which was able to scale up its support to those affected. Currently the project benefits more than 7.5 million.
Road Sector Development Program (RSDP) – how consistent support over long-term to the government’s priority area can
bring good results. In 1997, GoE formulated the 10-year Road Sector Development Program (RSDP 1997–2007), a two-phased
integrated package of investments, reforms, and institutional reorganization. The program was later extended and is now in its fourth
phase. The Bank has provided more than US$1.4 billion to the GoE to support its efforts in improving and expanding Ethiopia’s roads
network. Currently, IDA$818mln is still committed under APL2, 3 and 4. Over the past fifteen years of implementation, the WB
projects have helped Ethiopia to double its roads network from 26,550 km in 1997 to over 54,000 in 2011. The WB program has also
helped in strengthening the institutional capacity of the institutions responsible for transport development in Ethiopia (e.g., the
Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Urban Development and Construction) as well as institutions in charge of road sector
development and maintenance (e.g., the Ethiopian Road Authority as well as roads authorities at the regional municipal and woreda
level).

New Partnership FY13-FY16
A.

Key Principles

96.
The CPS is strongly anchored within GoE’s GTP which has been under implementation
since late 2010. Following the passing away of the Prime Minister in late August 2012, GoE
reconfirmed its concurrence with the main thrust and focus of the CPS, which is strongly
anchored in the GTP and has been developed through a highly consultative and collaborative
process. Areas of World Bank Group (WBG) engagement have been selected based on their
priority for the country and relevance for growth and poverty reduction as well as WBG’s
comparative advantage reflected in the combination of partnerships, knowledge and finance.
WBG engagement will be driven by a principle of partnering with GoE to look for pragmatic
solutions. The CPS uses GoE’s “transformational approach”; it builds on what has been
achieved so far (by using existing knowledge and portfolio as well as cross-country good
practice and experience) and continues its support in areas where there is strong government
ownership (e.g., infrastructure and social protection). However, learning from the previous CAS
and in order for the WBG to more effectively support GoE’s medium to long term development
agenda there are several elements in the CPS that are new:
i)

More effective partnership with Government in three areas: (i) macroeconomic issues by
gradually establishing a dedicated dialogue mechanism and providing financial support to
support macroeconomic stability through budget support; (ii) the job creation agenda by
offering, in collaboration with other development partners, a comprehensive package of
possible solutions from IDA,75 IFC and MIGA as well as strengthening dialogue with the
Government on regional integration issues; and (iii) improving the effectiveness of the
Government, by assisting GoE to strengthen the human capacities of the civil sector and
building country systems (including PFM and procurement).

ii) Extending partnerships with non-state stakeholders. In addition to strengthening already

good collaboration with the traditional donors, WBG will endeavor to reach out to nontraditional partners, including sources of FDI. WBG will seek more active engagement with
the regions though specific analytical work, closer engagement in portfolio management and
building their capacities. Finally, more systematic ways of engaging with non-government
partners will be pursued, including through the PPDF (Box 5).
iii) Instruments. Learning from the results of the CAS CR, WBG will deploy to a larger extent

its analytical work to inform its own as well as other partners’ work and to ensure that the
dialogue with GoE is evidence-based. In this context the Bank will support capacity building
of the Central Statistical Agency,76 to ensure better quality and reliability of data and M&E
systems. Moreover, as soon as macroeconomic framework allows, the budget support agenda
will be resumed (most likely starting with sectoral development policy lending and over time
moving towards multi-sectoral Development Policy Operations (DPOs)) to deepen policy
dialogue and support GoE’s focus on achieving macroeconomic balance, fostering use of
75

Including potential use of IDA guarantees.

country systems and increasing the predictability of aid.77 Finally, in line with GoE’s focus
on quality of basic services, the Bank plans to gradually increase its utilization of the recently
approved Program-for Results (PforR) instrument, commencing with the health and possibly
education sector. WBG will strive to allow greater in-built flexibility into the program
(lending and non-lending) so that it can be opportunistic and pragmatic in providing solutions
to GoE.
B.

CPS Design: Pillars and Outcomes

97.
The CPS Pillars are consistent with the key focal areas of the GTP (i.e., supporting job
creation in agriculture and industry; enhancing quality of social services; and increasing
government effectiveness). 78 In line with the GTP, gender and climate change have been
elevated to cross-cutting issues in the CPS and WBG will strengthen their mainstreaming into the
portfolio. The CPS framework is also consistent with the World Bank Africa Strategy. Based on
the existing project portfolio as well as the abovementioned CPS principles, the CPS will focus
on achievement of the following key strategic objective under its main pillars.79
98.
Pillar One: Fostering competitiveness and employment by supporting a stable
macroeconomic environment; increasing competitiveness and productivity; increasing and
improving delivery of infrastructure; and enhancing regional integration. Based on the key
constraints analyzed in Chapter I, Section B and in Chapter II, Sections A and B, this pillar will
focus on the following outcomes:
 Supporting structural and macroeconomic policies to sustain internal and external balance
and increase domestic resource mobilization;
 Increasing agriculture productivity and marketing in selected areas;
 Increasing competitiveness in manufacturing and services, and MSE access to financial
services;
 Increasing access to and quality of infrastructure – electricity, roads, and water and
sanitation;
 Improving regional integration by supporting the Eastern Africa Power Pool Mechanism
and enhanced involvement in regional agriculture technology generation and
dissemination.
99.
Pillar Two: Enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities by improving delivery
of social services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk
management. Based on the key constraints analyzed in Chapter II, Section C, this pillar will
focus on the following outcomes:
 Increasing access to quality health and education services;
 Enhancing the resilience of vulnerable households to food insecurity;
77

The DAG Group in collaboration with the Government agreed to increase usage of country systems from the
baseline of 52 percent in 2010 to 69 percent in 2014. Since many, especially bi-lateral, donors have limited scope for
moving towards Chanel 1 disbursements (e.g., using country systems), greater burden will fall on multilateral
institutions including the WBG.



Increasing adoption of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) systems;
Strengthening sustainable natural resource management and resilience to climate change.

100. Foundation: Good governance and state building. Based on the key constraints
analyzed in Chapter II, Section D, this foundation would focus on the following outcomes:
 Improving public service performance management and responsiveness;
 Enhancing space for citizen participation in the development process;
 Enhancing public financial management, procurement, transparency and accountability.
101. Cross-cutting themes in CPS. Gender will continued to be mainstreamed in the WBG
program through including activities focused on women in the design of projects (e.g., AGP,
ULGDP: Box 3) as well as through individual projects focused on women (e.g., WDEP: Box
4).80 WBG will build on the experiences from WEDP and the emerging research to further
support growth-oriented women MSE owners. WBG will also intensify its Analytical and
Advisory Activities (AAA) to create (to the extent possible) a full gender disaggregated poverty
profile for Ethiopia. A series of gender-focused policy notes will be prepared based on research
to: evaluate policies supporting female income generation; assess the effects (on school children)
after including a module on the basic gender rights and responsibilities in their school
curriculum; analyze constraints to access to justice of the poor and vulnerable groups (a followup to the study on the effectiveness of "domestic violence preventive actions" undertaken in
FY12).
Box 4: The Women Entrepreneurship Development Program – unleashing the growth potential of urban
women entrepreneurs
Recognizing the large economic potential of promoting female entrepreneurship, since May 2012 the Government is
implementing an IDA funded ($50m) Women Entrepreneurship Development Program (WEDP), which aims to address the
two most severe constraints to business growth as reported by growth-oriented women-owned MSEs: lack of access to
finance and of entrepreneurial and technical skills together with usage of low-productivity technologies. Through provision
of microfinance loans and other suitable financial instruments through MFIs to individual growth-oriented women
entrepreneurs, WEDP aims to provide at least 17 thousand loans over the 5 year. MFIs will benefit from a substantial
Technical Assistance (TA) to build their capacity to provide tailored financial products to female entrepreneurs. WEDP is
expected to deliver entrepreneurship skills enhancement to 20 thousand women entrepreneurs, together with technology
diffusion and cluster development where growth-oriented women entrepreneurs will get training and support in most basic
aspects of developing, running and growing a business.
In addition to being a key element in the gender strategy of the Bank in Ethiopia, WEDP also serves as an entry point for
discussing private sector policies concerning the country’s MSE segment, which is the most important source of employment
outside of agriculture. To contribute to the future policy dialogue, WEDP has a built-in impact evaluation that is designed to
measure the exact number of jobs created by the program and by different sub-components. The WEDP thus complements
the Bank’s efforts in the job creation agenda including regulatory concerns, business climate knowledge work and the
overarching policy framework including macro policies by providing evidence on employment creation.

102. WBG considers climate change as an important part of the development process.
Therefore, a focus on climate change will be mainstreamed into ongoing and future operations to
make them more “climate-smart.”81 Consequently, WBG will (i) support key sectors of crucial
importance to climate change (e.g., agricultural and pastoral development, sustainable land
80
81

See Appendix 5 for details.
See Appendix 7 for details on mainstreaming the Climate Change agenda into the Ethiopia portfolio.

Page 42

management and food security, and renewable energy); (ii) engage in specific studies and trials
under ongoing or future projects and programs with the aim to modify their design for an
increased climate change impact; (iii) strengthen the systematic and enhanced treatment of
climate impacts at the strategic level building on the IDA16 framework currently under
development, and based on selected case studies; and (iv) through its engagement with line
agencies, WBG will support the development of the Government’s Climate Resilient Strategy.
Finally, WBG will continue engaging in few climate change-specific tasks such as climate
information systems or other specific AAA products or supporting the agenda on Reducing
Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.

C.

Existing Portfolio and New Program

103. Existing Portfolio. Much of what the WBG will achieve during the CPS will depend on
the existing portfolio. As of July 1, 2012 (i.e., the start of the CPS, see Annex 9) the Bank had 25
active IDA-only projects in Ethiopia (two regional), of which 6 were added in FY12 (including 3
additional financing and one regional) for a total of US$1.12 billion. Twelve projects were cofinanced with other development partners. Total IDA commitments were US$5.1 billion (the
second highest in the Africa Region) and an undisbursed balance of US$2.26 billion. The
disbursement ratio in FY12 was 34.2 percent with disbursements amounting to US$727.6
million. Close to a half of the active IDA Portfolio supports infrastructure development (48
percent), mostly roads and electricity; there are two programs in social protection (PSNP and
PBS) which account for 39 percent of total commitments; and the remainder is distributed among
projects supporting private sector and finance, agriculture and public sector capacity building
and governance (2, 7 and 9 percent respectively). The existing portfolio is relatively well aligned
with the CPS strategic objectives (Table 6). Commitments at risk accounted for 10 percent of the
total portfolio (less than half of the average in the Africa Region) and two projects (Tourism and
Tana & Beles) were rated marginally unsatisfactory for Implementation Progress and
Development Objectives (suspension for the Tourism project was lifted in July 2012). However,
the Realism Index for Ethiopia, as determined by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), stood
at 40 percent, which is well below that for the World Bank and the Africa Region. The Country
Team is working jointly with GoE to address this issue through, inter alia, more systematic and
regular joint reviews of the portfolio and implementation issues arising.

104. New Lending. The total volume of lending is based on Ethiopia’s IDA allocation, which
is determined annually by the Country Performance Rating (CPR) that takes into account the
country’s policy performance and governance environment (as measured by the Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment – CPIA) and the performance of existing IDA portfolio. Although
over the past few years Ethiopia’s CPR has been relatively stable (e.g., between 3.35 in 2006 to
3.37 in 2011), its provisional IDA16 allocation of US$3.38 billion (e.g., US$1.1bn per year) is
close to 28 percent higher than IDA15 allocation due to the increased overall size of IDA16.82
82

IDA15 covered period of FY09-11; IDA16 covers FY12-14 and IDA17 will cover FY15-17. IDA resource
envelopes are provided for 3-year replenishment cycles. The FY13 allocation for Ethiopia of Special Drawing
Rights SDR759.2 million (equivalent of US$1.2bn) is firm while the FY14 allocation of SDR 664.5mln (US$1.1bn)
is indicative and can change depending on: (i) total IDA resources available in the respective fiscal year; (ii)
Ethiopia’s performance rating; (iii) the terms of IDA's assistance to the country (grants or credits) in the respective
fiscal year based on Ethiopia’s debt sustainability position; (iv) MDRI debt relief and the redistribution of the MDRI
compensatory resources as applicable; (v) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; and (vi)
the number of IDA-eligible countries. Note that Ethiopia’s IDA envelope was provided in SDR terms, and the US
dollar equivalent amounts are converted using the IDA16 replenishment rate of 1SDR=US$1.50233; however, the
exchange rate for each IDA operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of project approval.

Page 44

The CPS will span the last two years of IDA16 (FY13-14) and the first two years of IDA17
(FY15-16). In FY12 Ethiopia’s new commitments amounted to US$1.12 billion.83 The lending
program for the first two years of CPS (FY13-14) has been designed with a buffer of about 19
percent (US$1.5bn in FY13 and US$1.2bn in FY14). Given that the IDA allocation for the two
outer years of CPS (FY15-16) is not available, the CPS program is indicative and will be
reconfirmed based on the IDA17 allocation and discussions with the Government.

105. Lending selectivity and focus. The focus of the new lending program for the CPS period
relative to the CPS strategic objectives is presented in Table 6. Ethiopia’s new lending will most
likely remain heavily focused on infrastructure for two main reasons: (i) the Government
perceives IDA to bring high value addition in infrastructure sectors; and (ii) large part of IDA
support is provided through APLs (e.g., roads and water) or supporting multi-year Government
programs (e.g., energy). A key constraint affecting selectivity is an expectation (especially from
the donor community) for the Bank to engage more actively in the areas of macroeconomic
83

This includes an additional US$70 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window for the PSNP Additional
Financing as well as the Regional Eastern Africa Power Pool Project (APL1) presented to the Board in July 2012.

Page 45

development, private and financial sector support and public sector capacity building. Regarding
social sectors, although they attract more than a quarter of overall Official Development
Assistance ODA (2008-10, Development Assistance Group (DAG) data), there is an expectation
for the Bank to stay engaged in these areas to provide a coordinating role even if WBG financing
is declining (e.g., education). While acknowledging the constraints, the Country Team will
maintain its good track record on selectivity84 by opening up the budget support agenda (starting
most likely with sectoral DPOs), utilizing additional financing for successful projects, and
seeking opportunities for portfolio consolidation.
106. Addressing fiduciary risks in country portfolio. The CPPR provided several specific
recommendations on how to alleviate some fiduciary concerns. While some of the proposed
actions will require high-level interventions,85 many can be undertaken at the technical level and
within the CPS period.86 The Bank will address fiduciary risks through a multi-annual program
of fiduciary analytical work aimed at strengthening the policy dialogue in financial management
and procurement sectors (particularly at the regional level) and raising general awareness. This
program will consist of (i) Bi-annual federal level PEFA and Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR); (ii) Regional level PEFA and financial management Economic Sector Work
(ESW) as required; (iii) policy notes on specific areas of interest to the Government; and (iv)
Accounting and Auditing Report On The Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) updates.
These analytical products will be conducted in close coordination with other donors and GoE
among all relevant sectors. To complement this program, management is implementing a series
of regular meetings with GoE, and internal measures to ensure more effective portfolio
monitoring and evaluation. Finally, GAC filters will be introduced for all projects in the pipeline
for FY14.
107. Addressing safeguards risks in the country portfolio. The ambition of the GTP
targets, particularly for large-scale infrastructure and other initiatives such as large-scale
agriculture development which may require significant land-use change, present environmental
and social risks. At the same time, there is limited capacity in government at all levels (e.g.,
national, regional and local) to manage effectively such risks, and this limited capacity is further
undermined by the high rate of staff turnover in the civil service. While legally the
Environmental Protection Agency (or the Regional Environmental Authorities for small, local
projects) is responsible for review and clearance of assessments of potential environment and
social impacts of proposed projects, in practice this role has been delegated to sector agencies,
such as the Ministry of Agriculture, EEPCO and ERA. Moreover, quality review of environment
84

During the CAS period (FY09-11), the number of projects in the Ethiopia portfolio has decreased from 31 to 26
despite net commitments growing by US$800 million. As a result, the size of the new projects approved during this
period has increased reaching on average US$234 million.
85
For example, civil service reform, more active and early-on engagement of the regions, agreement with MoFED
and implementing agencies to start advanced procurement prior to WB loan approval.
86
For example, provision of regular (bi-annually or quarterly) training/FM and procurement clinics for PIU staff as
well as dedicated institutions (e.g., the Public Procurement Agency) in the areas of procurement, FM and
safeguards; establishment of Managers Network (PSCAP), Sectoral Groups and Finance Managers Club for
information and experience sharing; more consistent and rigorous application of Bank’s readiness filters to projects
under preparation; standardization of the FM Manuals; simplification of reporting at local level; development of
service delivery standards; piloting join preparation of Annual Work Plans, Annual budgets and Procurement Plans.

Page 46

and social safeguards for a proposal is undertaken more consistently if the proposal involves
donor financing. The Bank will take a two-pronged approach to address the related risk. First, to
ensure consistency of application and compliance with Bank safeguard policies, a high-level
policy dialogue on safeguards issues will be continued and the supervision of environmental and
social safeguards implementation in Bank financed projects will be further strengthened.87 This
strengthening will be complemented by additional training from the Bank for environmental and
social safeguards specialists and consultants, dissemination of resource materials on
environmental and social due diligence, and other broader capacity-building activities aimed at
building up expertise on environmental and social management. Second, the capacity of the
government system for environment and social safeguards implementation will be strengthened
in key sector agencies, such as EEPCO and ERA, through project components which focus on
the modernization of these agencies (see paragraph 69 on EEPCO), as well as broad-based
training on safeguards for these and other agencies.
108. Use of Country Systems (Channel 1 and 2). Ethiopia uses a number of alternative
mechanisms for channeling donor funds to spending units in the country.88 A recent review of
the Use of Country Systems by donors in Ethiopia confirmed that around 67 percent of World
Bank support is channeled through government systems, which is higher than the target set for
all donors in Ethiopia for the next reporting period. CPPR review has confirmed that World Bank
funds disbursing through Channel 1 (e.g., PBS and PSNP) have an average disbursement rate of
30 percent compared to 15 percent for Channel 2 projects (traditional Specific Investment
Lending). Consequently, during the CPS period, the World Bank will be proactively exploring
ways to moving its portfolio towards Chanel 1 (for example though increasing use of DPO and
PforR instruments). A systemic assessment for this is underway which involves analyzing the
quality of country PFM systems with a specific focus on risks and the mitigation measures that
need to be put in place. While there is clearly commitment to improving PFM systems in
Ethiopia the approach has been fragmented and there is a need for addressing the major
weaknesses identified in various diagnostics at different levels of government if donors are to
87

A particular risk arises because the Bank's Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) has not been
applied in Ethiopia, in part because of GoE concerns, but also because of uncertainty as to its compatibility with the
country context. To address the situation, discussions with GoE on how to apply the policy have been ongoing since
mid-2009. To enhance GoE familiarity with the policy, a joint World Bank-GoE workshop was held in early March
2011. GoE remains uncomfortable with the policy’s potential application in Ethiopia and progress has been slow in
reaching a joint understanding. The issue was again discussed with the Ethiopian Delegation at the 2011 Annual
Meetings, following which Bank management sent a letter to GoE with a proposal which remains under discussion.
At the 2012 Spring Meetings the GoE delegation reiterated its difficulties with the policy, but noted the need for
GoE and the Bank to jointly resolve this issue. Since February 2012, a note appearing in the MOP of each Board
package for Ethiopia has summarized the situation as: (a) dialogue between GoE and the Bank on OP 4.10 is
ongoing, (b) when agreement is reached, but in any event starting with operations considered by the Board after
December 2012, the policy would be applied to the extent that it is found to be relevant to the areas of operation of
the proposed projects; and (c) relevant operations presented to the Board in the meantime will endeavor to contain
features that approach functional equivalence with the policy even when it is not formally triggered. In lieu of
agreement with GoE on application of OP 4.10, in some projects, task teams have been able to achieve much of the
intent of OP 4.10 without triggering the policy (through the Environmental Assessment or Involuntary Resettlement
policies and procedures).
88
The most common are Channel 1a – viz. full use of government systems across all levels of Government though
MoFED; Channel 1b which uses Government systems only at the Federal level and Channel 2 viz. project aid that
bypasses MoFED and goes directly to a sector or a government entity at the sub national level.

Page 47

increasingly move to country systems. The Bank will also work with GoE to increase the use of
country procurement systems.

109. Non-lending assistance. As clearly indicated by the CAS CR and feedback from the
Client Survey and multi-stakeholders consultations, the Bank needs to ramp-up its knowledge
products (including analytical, advisory and technical assistance) especially in terms of its
relevance and timeliness. Non-lending assistance can take a variety of forms, including standard
Economic Sector Work (ESW), study tours, facilitation of knowledge and experience sharing
between Ethiopia and other countries (e.g., Rwanda, which shares a similar development
strategy), informal brainstorming, just-in-time studies and regular updates/policy notes. In
determining the focus of future non-lending assistance priority will be given according to three
criteria: (i) part of the core country diagnostics that needed regular updates; (ii) on-demand
policy notes to aid the Government’s policy making discussions; and (iii) covering innovative or
difficult areas of development. In addition, WBG will strive to engage more actively with the
Page 48

GoE as well as local think tanks and academia in the process of designing and conducting the
analytical work. Table 8 provides some of the major non-lending activities (ESW and TA)
planned during the CPS period; for a complete list see Annex 11.
110. Ethiopia Trust Funds (TFs) portfolio is one of the largest in the Africa Region with
US$642 million in commitments allocated in 68 TFs as of June 1, 2012.89 Recipient-executed
TFs account for 38 percent of the total number of active TFs and 95 percent of the total
commitments. Two donors, UK and EU, provide almost three quarters of total contributions (61
and 12 percent respectively). Ethiopia TF portfolio is well aligned with the WB program with a
clear focus on social sectors: at the beginning of the CPS period, 86 percent of TF portfolio was
contributing to CPS Pillar 2 (resilience and vulnerability) and 13 percent to Pillar 1
(competitiveness and employment). Further, more than a half of all TF commitments (52
percent) were co-financing one multi-donor education project (GEQIP); another 17 percent of TF
supported water and sanitation sector, 13 percent went to support social sectors (PBS and PSNP)
and 10 percent went to agriculture.
111. While TFs are relatively well aligned with CPS objectives, there is still a need to shift
towards a more programmatic and less fragmented trust fund portfolio. The average size of a
grant under a Bank-Executed trust fund was US$774,000; however close to a half of such grants
were smaller than US$250,000. Recipient-Executed trust funds tend to be larger in size
(US$24million on average) particularly those associated with the education, PBS and PSNP
operations. Ethiopia also has a large portfolio of Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs), where the
Bank only acts as a trustee and transfers funds to implementing agencies outside the Bank. The
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM)90, the largest FIF in the Bank,
had Ethiopia as its largest beneficiary in FY10.
D.

IFC and MIGA Programs

112. IFC Program. IFC has been “open for business” in Ethiopia since 2008 and its program
supports particularly the first pillar of this strategy with a focus on three areas: (i) project
development in key strategic sectors (e.g., agribusiness, infrastructure, financial services, tourism
and manufacturing); (ii) removal of investment climate constraints; and (iii) building
entrepreneurial capacity. Since FY08, IFC has committed a total of US$83.6 million including
investments in the Ethio Cement project that helped to establish a green-field integrated cement
plant; equity investment in the Saudi German Hospitals Group, which will construct a hospital in
Addis Ababa, the Group’s first venture in Africa; equity investment in Nyota Minerals Ltd for its
Tulu Kapi Gold to support gold exploration and in Allana Potash to help explore potash reserves;
and the Ethiopian Coffee projects (with TechnoServe) that provide financing to specialty coffee
farmer cooperatives under the Ethiopian component of the East Africa Coffee Initiative. IFC’s
advisory services provide support to improve the investment climate, encourage entrepreneurs,
89

See Annex 12 for portfolio of active TF. Calculations exclude HIPC TFs.
In addition to the GFATM, Ethiopia is a major recipient of other FIFs such as the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural (CGIAR), the Climate Investment Fund, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and
Immunization (GAVI), the Global Agriculture & Food Security Program (GAFSP), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and
the Least Developed Countries Fund for Climate Change (LDCF).

and promote better access to finance, especially SMEs. Establishing the Public Private Dialogue
Forum and Warehouse Receipts Finance Program are among the most noteworthy IFC
engagement to improve Ethiopia’s investment climate (Box 5).
113. In the coming years IFC’s portfolio is expected to grow with a particular focus on
opportunities in power, mining, manufacturing and tourism:


IFC in collaboration with the WB and potentially other donors is focusing on the
development of geothermal resources in Ethiopia starting with exploring the possibilities for
establishing a geothermal development fund.
As part of its engagement in the mining sector, IFC will work with other parts of WBG to
assist GoE in modernizing Ethiopia’s mining regulatory framework and raising investor
interest in the Ethiopian mining sector.
IFC is strongly interested in assisting GoE in development of industrial zones. IFC China and
Ethiopia Offices are actively engaged in developing a structure under which IFC could invest
in the companies that setup operations in the Ethiopia Industrial Zone in coordination with
China Africa Development Fund (CAD Fund).
IFC is keen to help Ethiopia to realize its potential as a significant tourism destination (Box
2).

Box 5: IFC initiatives to improve business environment in Ethiopia
Warehouse Receipts (WHR) Finance Program: IFC partnered with the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (ECX) and
selected Ethiopian commercial banks to develop Warehouse Receipts Finance markets in Ethiopia, through a combination
of advisory services and investments package. The program is funded by IFC (US$1mln) and four other partners from
Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Japan (US$2.5mln). Under the investment component, up to US$10 million of financing
is allocated to the participating banks in the form of guarantees (risk-sharing) or short-term lines of credit (co-financing) on
their WHR lending portfolio of up to US$20 million. IFC has committed its first WHR finance facilities in March 2011 to
the United Bank and NIB Bank. WHR-based loans (covering mostly sesame and pea beans) grew to US$1.5 million in
FY11 from US$50,000 in FY10. This amount is expected to grow to US$ 6million by the end of the current harvest season.
The advisory service component is also progressing well and ECX is now ready to launch the program with the United
Bank and CBE.
Ethiopia Public Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF): On July 8th 2010, GOE, the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and
Sectoral Associations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to guide the PPDF. The first PPDF meeting was organized
on February 22, 2011 bringing together representatives of the private sector and the Government in a structured dialogue to
discuss and ultimately address key obstacles to firms’ growth and competiveness as well as to establish mutual trust and
understanding between the public and private sector. So far the Forum has facilitated improvements in tax and trade
logistics legislations. IFC jointly with UNDP have been instrumental in helping structure and lead this process and the two
institutions have recently agreed to fund the first year of the PPD process at the federal level for a total of US$650,000.

114. The pipeline of IFC knowledge-based activities includes ramping up its support to GoE
to improve the country’s business environment. In addition to continued support to the PPDF, the
program would focus on simplification of business registration and tax administration,
supporting industry specific investment climate reforms (including investment policy and
promotion), and trade logistics. There are ongoing discussions in developing IFC’s Global Trade
Finance Program as well as potential support that IFC could provide to the development of
Alternative Dispute Resolution as a means to alleviate the burden on the court system and
improve speedy, amicable resolution of commercial disputes. Finally, there is an ongoing
process under the Access Leasing project, where IFC would provide a combination of equity

Page 50

investments and advisory services to establish the first leasing company in the country,
sponsored by Access Capital.
115. MIGA Program. MIGA is also supporting the objectives of pillar one, and is currently
insuring three projects in Ethiopia (two in agribusiness and one in cement) with total net
exposure of US$16.8 million (see Annex 10). The first agribusiness project supports an
investment by Africa Juice BV of the Netherlands which, in Africa, is represented by Juice
Tibila Share Company. Africa Juice Tibila Share Company is a producer and exporter of
tropical fruit juices. The second agribusiness project involves the privatization, rehabilitation,
and expansion of an existing farm which will result in a 600 hectare plantation of yellow passion
fruit, an additional 600 hectares of other tropical fruits such as mango and papaya, and the
construction of a new fruit-processing facility. The manufacturing project supports a minority
equity investment by Schulze Global Investments (SGI) into the National Cement Share
Company of Ethiopia (NCSC). The investment by SGI will help NCSC to expand its operations
in Dire Dawa, through supporting the construction of a new 3,000 tpd clinker plant. In order to
accelerate the construction of the new plant, NCSC engaged SGI for a round of equity financing.
The expansion of the plant is expected to result in additional significant tax revenue to the
government and the creation of up to 600 new local jobs directly, and potentially an additional
2,500 indirect jobs. It will also provide an increased supply of domestic cement to meet the
growing demand in Ethiopia, thereby reducing the country’s reliance on expensive imports and
reducing the drain on foreign exchange reserves.
116. In addition, MIGA remains open for business in Ethiopia across all of its Political Risk
Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract and
War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations. MIGA has
also made use of its more streamlined Small Investment Product (SIP) where more streamlined
procedures have allowed smaller projects to be supported.
E.

Partnerships

117. Official Development Assistance to Ethiopia has been growing fast over the last decade,
more than quadrupling from US$ 0.7 billion in 2000 to US$2.9 billion in 2009, before declining
to US$2.6 billion in 2010.91 Although there has been a significant proliferation of donors (from
25 in 2006 to about 36 in 2010, including non-traditional donors), the US and IDA accounted for
close to a half of all ODA disbursements, followed by the UK, EU, Global Fund and AfDB.
Nonetheless, aid to Ethiopia has a strong multilateral dimension as almost 80 percent of ODA
(2011) is administered through multilateral institutions from own resources or through multidonor arrangements (MDTFs). Non-traditional donors92 are increasing their presence with new
modalities of development finance linked to specific trade and investments deals. Over a third of
ODA received by Ethiopia is humanitarian assistance over which GoE has little influence (most
is delivered through multilaterals and NGO, less than 10 percent through GoE). Support to

91

Appendix 8 provides detailed donor mapping.
Non-traditional donors in Ethiopia include private donors such as Bill and Melinda Foundation, donors from
China, India, Arab countries, and Global Programs, among others.
92

Page 51

infrastructure accounts for 11 percent of total ODA (6 percent excluding IDA) and to the private
sector (including agriculture and finance) for 8 percent (5 percent excluding IDA).
118. Donor collaboration in Ethiopia has a long track record. It includes a High Level Forum
with GoE, several joint donor: GoE Sector and Technical Working Groups (SWGs, TWGs),
some of which work more effectively than others, with a direct correlation with a functioning
funding mechanism (see Appendix 8 for dialogue structure between the GoE and Development
Partners (DPs)). Currently there are ongoing discussions between GoE and development partners
on the overall dialogue structure including finalization of the ToRs for the main SWGs,
definition of common operational procedures, reporting lines and links among SWGs, with
funding programmes and task forces. Recently there has been a renewed interest in the Aid
Management Platform (AMP) as a management and M&E tool.
119. Out of 25 IDA projects in Ethiopia portfolio at the start of the CPS, 12 were co-financed
with other donors, including the two largest IDA programs (PBS and PSNP) as well as AGP,
GEQIP, PSCAP, WASH and WDEP. A recent quantitative data assessment of Ethiopia´s
compliance with the Paris Declaration principles on aid effectiveness concluded that many of
IDA projects were in compliance with the Paris Declaration principles of aid effectiveness and
showing significant progress over the years in areas such as coordinated technical cooperation,
use of country systems, and untying aid. 93 Going forward, the Bank will continue with the
practice of joint financing of projects wherever possible; resuming the budget support agenda
would also assist in increased donor collaboration as well as use of country systems. In addition
to strengthening already good collaboration with the traditional donors, the WBG will endeavor
to pursue co-financing opportunities with non-traditional partners; seek more active engagement
with the regions as well as with non-government partners.
F.

Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation

120. The CPS Results Framework (CPS RF) presents the priorities of the Bank in
Ethiopia in alignment with the strategic goals of Ethiopia, and was developed in
collaboration with GoE and Development Partners. The CPS RF (Appendix 3) uses
Ethiopia’s GTP as its starting point, and narrows down the range of outcomes to those that the
Bank intend to influence directly through its interventions over the CPS period. GoE,
development partners, and other stakeholders provided detailed inputs that were incorporated
into the CPS RF. In addition, the CPS outcomes are aligned with the sector strategies for the
country. The CPS RF illustrates the overarching national goals from the GTP to which the CPS
outcomes, milestones, and related interventions seek to contribute. As mentioned before, the
results targets during the CPS period will be largely achieved with the program already under
implementation
121. To the extent possible, the CPS M&E system will be linked with national M&E
systems. The GTP requires a comprehensive M&E system to collect data to track its progress
and report results. Hence, the CPS M&E system will focus on complementing and enhancing
the government’s results management capacities. Toward that end, the Bank in developing the
93

Aid Effectiveness: Ethiopia, MoFED 2012

Page 52

CPS M&E system, will work to increase demand for M&E information at national, regional, and
local levels through linking planning, budgeting, and reporting with results. It will work towards
strengthening M&E and national statistical systems through improvement of data quality for
basic service sectors and by supporting specific M&E studies and surveys.94
122. Efforts will continue to strengthen Ethiopia statistical capacity, which is a key to
ensuring availability and timeliness of quality data to monitor high-level country outcomes and
producing the national accounts statistics. The capacity challenges will primarily be addressed
through TA programs to address gaps in national and sub-national statistical capacities, including
though ongoing collaboration between the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia and the World
Bank Living Standards Measurement Study team (LSMS) on the Ethiopia Rural Socioeconomic
Survey.95 Recently, GoE has requested assistance from the WB Statistics for Results Facility
(SRF) – Catalytic Fund. The Ethiopian SRF is expected to support the implementation of
National Strategy for Development of Statistics (2019/10-2013/14) through, inter alia,
infrastructure capacity development at the CSA and key Ministries; data development and
management; methodological research and analysis; information dissemination; and M&E
capacity building.96
123. To develop a results-oriented M&E system for the Ethiopia CPS, the new Results
Integration and Management System (RIMsys) tool, developed by the World Bank, will be
used to systematically capture and consolidate information on CPS targeted results and monitor
the progress toward their achievement. The key feature of the RIMsys includes the ability to link
the performance of Bank operations and the achievement of CPS results. In addition, the tool
produces portfolio management and results reports on a periodic basis. A CPS progress report
will be prepared in FY14, or earlier if needed, to report on progress toward CPS outcomes and
adjust the strategy and program if necessary and update the results framework.
G.

Managing Risks

124. Ethiopia faces a range of external and internal risks, the potential impacts of which can be
mitigated in part by WBG. Other risks may not be susceptible of mitigation but WBG
nevertheless needs to be aware of them so that we can respond appropriately to the extent that
the risk arises.
125. Ethiopia is vulnerable to external economic shocks, including the negative economic
impact from a protracted slowdown in the EU and other high income economies, as well as
natural disasters. A slowdown of remittances, standing at around 9 percent of GDP, could
reduce domestic consumption, one of the main drivers of recent growth. The high concentration
of exports in commodity and primary goods and the significant share of exports going to OECD
94

E.g., the Bank will supporting the Woreda and City benchmarking survey for monitoring local developments in
local governance.
95
This work program is a multi-year program that encompasses the design and implementation of a household
survey integrated with the Agricultural Sample Survey, a panel component of this new survey, capacity building and
cross-country knowledge sharing, and efforts to improve survey methodologies.
96
Statistical capacity building is also supported by DFID, Gates-Melinda Foundation, UN and Irish Aid.

Page 53

countries also pose a risk. And the recent spike in global food prices is also a cause for concern.
A strong and resilient framework of macroeconomic policies can help GoE manage for such a
risk, and WBG can assist GoE in the context of the proposed stronger engagement on such
issues, and possible development policy lending.
126. There is a potential trade-off between economic growth and overall debt
sustainability. This is particularly important in a state-led development model which relies on
large public investment (double digits, above 20 percent in terms of GDP) in an environment of
low levels of domestic savings (single digits in terms of GDP). The gap will, to a large extent, be
shouldered through the accumulation of debt (domestic and external). Given the authorities'
intention to keep to a low risk of external debt distress, the amount of non-concessional
borrowing will be limited. So there may be a trade-off between the low risk rating desired by
GoE and the implementation pace of the GTP, which may require lengthening of the GTP
implementation period to smoothen the non-concessional financing requirements for the planned
investments. This may have growth implications for the economy at large, given the large role of
investment in GDP expansion at the moments. WBG has already expressed a view about this
risk, in the context of the IDA-IMF staff Joint Advisory Note on the GTP. In terms of managing
for this risk WBG needs to ensure the implementation schedules for operations are robust and
allow for such fluctuations in the overall pace of public investment in Ethiopia.
127. For a number of years Ethiopia has been perceived as having a culture that inhibits
corruption and levels of corruption have been thought to be significantly lower than for its
regional comparators. However, worldwide experience shows that even countries with such a
culture face increasing challenges when rapid economic growth is coupled with significant
government intervention in the management of the economy. This combination can feed the
emergence of unhealthy relationships between politicians and bureaucrats on the one hand, and
entrepreneurs and investors on the other. Experience also shows that the discipline that comes
with a vibrant private sector can help mitigate this risk. Achieving a balanced equilibrium along
these lines will apply to relations both with the domestic private sector, and with foreign
investors. Accountability and transparency in the oversight of FDI will be just as important as in
the domestic sector, if the developmental benefits of entrepreneurialism – including those
associated with broad-based growth and job creation – are to be maximized. WBG lending and
non-lending assistance on fostering competitiveness and employment will offer help to GoE in
striking this balance correctly, while the strong foundation of the WBG program in good
governance should minimize the risk that WBG operations are exposed to risks from economic
capture.
128. Natural disasters, of which droughts have been the most frequent occurrence in
Ethiopia, may cause serious setbacks to economic advancements and jeopardize achievements in
reducing poverty and vulnerability of Ethiopian poor. As the impact of climate change is
increasingly felt in Ethiopia, the economic effects of such events are likely to grow. However,
growth and diversification of the Ethiopian economy (supported under Pillar 1) together with a
range of interventions supported under Pillar 2 will help to increase the resilience and decrease
the vulnerability of Ethiopian people and thus help mitigate or manage this risk.

Page 54

129. An essential building block of Government’s vision of economic and social
transformation is a capable public service at all levels of government (at federal, regional,
woreda level, and increasingly in kebeles). A public service which is appropriately capacitated
to take forward service delivery of appropriate quality, whilst ensuring universal access, is
fundamental to the change processes at the heart of government’s agenda of fighting poverty.
That this public service acts with integrity is also critical, particularly given that the development
of formal processes of checks and balances is still very much work in progress. There is a risk,
however, that capacity development and probity of the public service may not be able to
keep pace with the broader reform agenda. High turn-over within the public service and the
expansion of the number of woredas will exacerbate this challenge. The risk of the potentials of
inadequate capacity is one which has been identified by Government itself, and it has invested
much effort already in building capacity and local leadership. The foundation of our CPS and the
proposed lending and non-lending activities, including those supporting work on safeguards (see
paragraph 107) are designed to provide the support to GoE to help them manage this risk.
130. The following are risks of which WBG needs to be aware, but for which the main
available mitigation available is likely to be close participation in the arrangements for
coordinating development partners in Ethiopia. These are:


Regional security risks. Relations with Eritrea have been problematic, including localized
tension along the border. The ongoing tensions between Sudan and South Sudan also present
challenges; whilst Ethiopia is seen as an ‘honest broker’ by both sides, conflict between the
governments in Khartoum and Juba, have the tendency to spill over into Ethiopia’s borders,
either by way of people fleeing conflict or, occasionally, when competing armed groups
cross borders resulting in instability within Ethiopia itself. Finally, instability fed by Islamic
fundamentalists in Somalia also presents problems, as the porous borders with Ethiopia’s
Ogaden result in unrest being transplanted to within Ethiopia itself. The dangers of all these
potential hotspots present challenges to Ethiopia on at least two accounts: (i) they represent a
significant distraction and make the delivery of services in certain parts of the country more
difficult; and (ii) through the spill-over of localized conflict, they carry risks for Ethiopia’s
internal security.



Political transition risk. There is a risk associated with the sudden passing away of the
Prime Minster and ensuring a smooth transition in the coming months. To this end, GoE has
indicated that the government continues to work as usual and has expressed its confidence
that the existing public institutions will continue to function normally despite the transition.
Furthermore, GoE has confirmed that the GTP remains the centerpiece of the country's
development strategy, its commitment to the vision and goals stated in the GTP and that it
will pursue its implementation as planned. GoE also reaffirmed its concurrence with the main
thrust and focus of the CPS, which is strongly anchored in the GTP and has been developed
through a highly consultative and collaborative process. Since the WBG Strategy is firmly
anchored in the GTP, the risk of its implementation will be closely linked to that of the
national program. In the longer term there is also a risk associated with the next elections
scheduled for 2015.

significant challenges in scaling up
evidence based interventions to reduce
maternal deaths. The gains made in child
mortality reduction also need to be
sustained and further enhanced.

Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report FY 2008 – 2012
Date of CAS: April 29, 2008
Date of CAS Progress Report: September 29, 2010
Period covered by CAS: FY08 – FY12 (extended one year)
Period covered by this report: April 2008 – March 2012

I. Introduction
A. Methodology
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) presents an assessment of the
International Development Association’s (IDA) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia for
FY08 – FY12. The CASCR aims to evaluate two dimensions of the CAS program implementation: i)
program performance in influencing the CAS outcomes as laid out in the results framework and ii) the
Bank’s performance in designing and managing the implementation of the program. In addition, this
report offers lessons for the forthcoming Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
2.
The CASCR draws on key reviews undertaken during the implementation period, most notably
the 2010 CAS Progress Report (CASPR), project implementation completion reports (ICR) and project
implementation status and results reports (ISR). The CASPR, which was discussed with the Government
and other stakeholders, made formal adjustments to the strategy reflecting realities on the ground. These
changes have been taken into account in this CASCR. This report also benefits from a workshop
undertaken with the country team and government counterparts in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in February
2012.
B. Summary of performance
3.
The performance of the CAS program (FY08-FY12) is rated Moderately Satisfactory
overall. The rating is an aggregate measure of progress made toward achieving CAS outcomes
which were achieved in varying degrees. Under pillar one of the CAS, ‘Fostering Economic Growth’,
progress was made during the CAS period to invest in critical infrastructure for growth. However, there
was limited success in achieving macro-economic stability, particularly inflation, and structural reforms.
That said, the FY08 CAS had clearly acknowledged that these were areas of weak dialogue with the
Government of Ethiopia (GoE). Consequently the program was less ambitious on macro-stability and
structural reform. Under pillar two, ‘Improving Access to and Quality of Basic Services’, access to basic
services increased significantly under the CAS but improving the quality of services was less successful.
This is partly due to the focus on increased access in order to achieve the MDGs which placed a strain on
existing facilities. Under pillar three, ‘Reducing Vulnerability’, the GoE’s Food Security Program and its
largest component, the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP), had a positive impact on securing the
access to food for chronically food insecure households. PSNP and the emergency Food Crisis Response
Program were important instruments through which the Bank helped mitigate the effects of the 2008 food
crisis. Vulnerability to environmental degradation was reduced by investments in watershed rehabilitation
and flood management. Nonetheless, environmental pressures will remain a long-term challenge in light
of Ethiopia’s fast rate of population growth. Under pillar four ‘Fostering Improved Governance’, the CAS
program contributed to improved social accountability at the local level through citizen groups and
participatory planning processes in woredas and targeted cities. Governance was also a cross-cutting
theme in all pillars (see also para 39). At the national level, an anti-corruption policy has been prepared,
Page 73

but has not yet been ratified by the Council of Ministers. Finally, under “Other Outcomes”, over 60% of
IDA support was provided through program-based approaches, most notably PSNP and the Provision of
Basic Services Program (PBS). New lending partially complied with the Africa Gender Action Plan
criteria for gender mainstreaming in lending operations.
4.
Bank performance and implementation is rated Moderately Satisfactory. CAS design and
CASPR adjustments were relevant and aligned to GoE objectives. The majority of indicators in the CAS
results matrix are appropriate to measure the CAS outcomes; however a few outlier indicators have been
identified in the assessment. While the text of the CAS and the CASPR provided a realistic account of
what the constraints and opportunities were under each pillar, this was not reflected in some of the
indicators and targets which were overambitious. 1 The Bank scaled-up successful programs such as
PSNP, PBS, Roads APL and the Urban Local Governance and Development Project (ULGDP).
Partnerships with other donors were maintained and the Bank often took the technical lead. Risk
management could have been stronger had mitigation measures been better identified during CAS design
and the CASPR. Portfolio performance was satisfactory as the portfolio size and composition was well
managed and disbursement levels were maintained at a high level. IEG evaluations of projects that closed
during the CAS period noted that efficiency (value for money) could have been better and that M&E
design, implementation and utilization also need improvement.
C. Economic context
5.
During the CAS period, Ethiopia continued to experience strong economic growth. The
main determinants of the sustained economic growth are the good performance of agricultural production
(which comprises around 47.7% of the total economy)2, the manufacturing and services sectors, as well as
the expansion of the construction sector (mainly roads and hydroelectric dams and housing).3 Annual real
GDP growth was 10.8% in 2008, declining to 8.8% in 2009, and it is projected to be 7.6% in 2011 (see
Table 1), with a per capita GDP shy of US$ 400 in 2011.
6.
Similarly to many other African countries, Ethiopia’s macroeconomic situation deteriorated
after the onset of the global economic crisis in 2008. The country’s end-of-period inflation rose to 64%
in July 2008 and its foreign exchange reserves fell to less than US$ 770 million (or less than four weeks
of import coverage) by October 2008. Recovery was supported by a 14 months arrangement under the
IMF’s High Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility approved in August 2009 and
concluded in November 2010. During this period, inflation declined to single digits but rose again
reaching 32% in January 2012 and declining slightly to 29% in April 2012. According to the IMF,
Ethiopia’s highly expansionary monetary policy, that has been highly inflationary, could undermine
macroeconomic stability.4
7.
Structural impediments to growth remain to be tackled, namely, more room for private
sector development and a better investment climate. Ethiopia’s ranking in the Doing Business report
declined from 104th in 2011 to 111th in 2012. Some of the constraints in the investment climate, as
perceived by the private sector, 5 include access to finance, tax administration, business licensing,
reliability of electricity and a mismatch of skills in the labor market. Aside from these cross-cutting
1

Notable disconnects include maintaining single digit inflation in light of the country’s soaring inflation over period 2008 –
2010, using increased private sector credit as a ratio of GDP as a proxy for private sector activity and reaching 87% school
completion rates.

constraints, abrupt policy changes in the regulatory environment may have undermined private sector
confidence. Examples include changes to or the introduction of price caps, the trade licensing law, land
leasing regulation, and a credit cap on the banking industry. Meanwhile, some positive measures to
promote small and medium enterprises have been taken, such as lowering the administrative costs of entry
for micro-firms.

Ethiopia has significantly invested in infrastructure for growth over the CAS period. This
has been particularly prominent in the transport and communication sector. Ethiopia’s vast hydropower
potential is being developed as the country prepares to become a regional power exporter. Agricultural
production and productivity has increased for major crops such as barley, maize, sorghum, teff and
wheat due to increases in investments in agricultural inputs and area coverage. . Exports of oil seed,
livestock and legumes have also increased, however, food prices have not fallen.
9.
Decentralization to the district and sub-district level is a focus of Ethiopia’s strategy to improve
responsiveness and flexibility in service delivery and increase local participation. Whilst in theory
districts (woredas) have substantial powers, in practice limited resources have been a brake on budget
discretion, despite significant increases in sub-national revenue raising. Public sector reform and capacity
building continue at the national level.
10.
The worst effects of the simultaneous food and fuel crisis in 2008 were stabilized through a
national food security strategy. Towards the end of 2008 6.4 million people were dependent on
emergency food assistance, in addition to 7.3 million chronically food insecure people. Similarly, the
PSNP and the humanitarian response system were also able to address the 2011 Horn of Africa drought to
avoid the severe impacts that were seen in neighboring areas. However, the developments over the past
years have shown that Ethiopia is still far away from achieving the paradigm shift away from
Page 75

humanitarian food aid. Humanitarian aid provided to Ethiopia in the period of 2008 to 2011 was
extremely high, averaging about US$ 807 million annually. Despite strong national growth in agriculture
and food production as well as very significant investments to support food-insecure households, food
insecurity increased compared to the period of the previous CAS. Based on figures from MoFED March
2012 (“Ethiopia’s Progress Towards Eradicating Poverty: An Interim Report on Poverty Analysis Study
(2010/11)”), the absolute number of food-poor people in Ethiopia increased from about 27.0 million in
2004/05 to about 28.4 million in 2010/11. Given continued population pressure and increased weather
volatility through climate change, a re-thinking of Ethiopia’s approach and the Bank’s support to achieve
food-security might be needed.
11.
Ethiopia is making significant progress on all the MDGs and is projected to be one of the
few African countries on track to meet goals relating to extreme poverty and hunger, combating
HIV/AIDS and malaria and developing a global partnership for development. Good progress has
been made on increasing access to universal primary education, reducing child mortality and increasing
access to safe drinking water. Tackling gender disparity in education and improving the quality of
education and health services remain a challenge for Ethiopia.

II.

CAS Program Performance

A. Overview and principles of engagement
12.
Ethiopia’s FY08-12 CAS supported the GoE to achieve many of the outcomes envisioned in
its 2005-2010 Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty (PASDEP).
PASDEP, finalized in 2007, was Ethiopia’s second poverty reduction strategy and placed rapid and
sustained growth at its center. It also had strong emphasis on achieving the MDGs, particularly on
increasing access to basic services. The key objectives of the CAS aimed to sustain Ethiopia’s rapid
economic growth and improvement in service delivery. The four objectives of the CAS, i) fostering
economic growth, ii) improving access to and improving quality of basic services, iii) reducing
vulnerability and iv) fostering improved governance, were relevant and broadly aligned with the
objectives of PASDEP. This was also Ethiopia’s first results-based CAS with clearly defined outcomes
and indicators (discussed in detail in section B and annex 1).
13.
The Bank responded to GoE’s request to help mitigate the shocks related to the food, fuel
and financial crises in FY09. An emergency food crisis response program was included in November
2008 to avoid the worst effects of drought and rising food prices. Under this program two IDA credits
were approved:
 Additional financing or the Productive Safety Nets Program (PSNP), which supported food and
cash assistance to food insecure households (US$ 25 million);
 Fertilizer Support Project providing foreign exchange to support the import distribution and sale
of fertilizer (US$ 250 million).
14.
The CAS period was extended by one year to FY12 due to slower than expected progress
toward CAS outcomes and to allow sufficient time to prepare a full new CAS program, in
cooperation with the GoE to support its 2010-2015 Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP,
November 2011). The GTP’s objectives are to (a) attain high growth within a stable macroeconomic
framework; (b) achieve the MDGs in the social sectors; and (c) establish a stable democratic and
developmental state. To accomplish its objectives, the GTP identifies the following strategic pillars: (i)
sustained rapid growth; (ii) agriculture; (iii) industrialization; (iv) infrastructure investments; (v)
enhanced social development; (vi) strengthened governance; and (vii) empowerment of youth and

Page 76

women. The GTP shifts the focus towards industrialization and speeding up Ethiopia’s structural
transformation to become a middle-income country by 2025.
15.
The FY08-12 CAS lending program was mostly comprised of programmatic sector investments
and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). In keeping with the objectives of the CAS, a large portion
of sector investments focused on provision of basic services (US$1,205m, 27% of the total CAS
program), infrastructure development (US$1,055m, 24% of the CAS program) and social safety net
programs (US$875m, 20% of the total CAS program). A smaller portion of lending focused on
agriculture (US$590m, 13% of the total CAS program), governance and public sector development
(US$350m, 8% of the total CAS program), and private sector development (US$235m, 5% of the total
CAS program).6 The trust fund portfolio continued to be one of the largest in the Africa Region and
disbursed US$ 3.46 billion during the CAS period. The majority of trust funds were used to co-finance
IDA lending operations primarily in the human development sector, ensuring there was adequate
alignment. The AAA portfolio focused on promoting pillar one of the CAS, “Fostering Economic
Growth” and pillars two and three, “Improving Access to and Quality of Basic Services” and “Reducing
Vulnerabilities”.
16.
Adjustments were made to the CAS program following the CASPR in FY10. Additional
financing was favored as the most efficient lending instrument. The CASPR made a number of
suggestions for the remaining CAS period FY11-12. These include scaling up existing operations,
discussing a new phase on Sustainable Land Management that focuses on land administration, women’s
economic empowerment and piloting results-based investment lending to support achievements in the
health sector7. The CASPR suggested that the program could potentially include a PRSC if the Bank and
the GoE reach an agreement on an agenda for structural change related to private sector development.
This however, has not been achieved. The CASPR adjusted the timing of various operations and the
Ethiopia/Kenya Interconnector was delayed until late FY12 8 , the Pastoral Community Development
Project was not given additional financing and the Roads APL 5 remains pending until the completion of
necessary analytical work. The CASPR also indicated that the FY11-12 non-lending program focus on
improving decentralized service delivery, spurring private-sector led industrial growth and ensuring food
security, most of which is planned or underway at the time of this report.

IFC re-opened its offices in Ethiopia in FY10 with the appointment of a Resident
Representative. IFC is expanding its investments and advisory services in the country through a strategy
based on three pillars: (i) improving the investment climate; (ii) pro-active project mobilization in
priority sectors and (iii) support to SMEs through linkages, improved access to finance, and integrated

supply chain development. IFC investments as of date total US$ 74m and cover five major sectors as
shown in the table below.
18.
IFC advisory services, which were designed and developed in collaboration with the Government
of Ethiopia, focused on access to finance and investment climate issues. On access to finance, IFC
partnered with the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange (“ECX”) and select Ethiopian commercial banks to
develop Warehouse Receipts Finance markets in Ethiopia. The initiative’s main objective is to promote
access to finance for farmers by leveraging their own production. IFC was instrumental in helping
structure and lead the Ethiopia public-private dialogue process together with UNDP, including the
establishment of a secretariat for the Ethiopian Public Private Consultative Forum (EPPCF).
B. Progress by strategic engagement theme (towards CAS outcomes)
19.
The assessment of Bank program is based on a set of specific CAS outcomes as laid out in
the CAS results framework and updated during the CASPR. The outcomes are assessed to be
achieved, partly achieved or not achieved.9 The assessment is based on quantitative baselines and targets,
with evidence compiled from available monitoring and evaluation arrangements. In some cases where
outcomes cannot be measured quantitatively, the assessment considers additional information such as
proxy indicators or progress on milestones. The assessment is corroborated with evidence gathered from
the latest ISRs, ICRs, IEG evaluations of completed projects and interviews with the responsible project
task team leaders. The CAS and the CASPR clearly state that satisfactory performance will have
been achieved if 70 -75% of the entire set of outcomes are fully attained.10

Fostering economic growth: the CAS program aimed to support Ethiopia’s goal to foster
economic growth through structural and macroeconomic policies that are conducive to sustaining internal
and external balance, strengthening the road sector institutions and the domestic road construction
industry, enhancing regional integration, increasing agricultural productivity in intervention areas,
improving financial sector performance, reducing the cost of internet services and improving the
investment climate. These outcomes were to be supported by the Public Sector Capacity Building
Program (PSCAP), Roads Sector Development APL, the Energy Access Project, the Nile Basin Initiative
Power Export Project, the Pastoral Community Development Program, the Irrigation and Drainage
Project and the Sustainable Land Management Project, the Private Sector and Financial Sector
Development projects among others, as well as a range of AAA, particularly for outcomes 1, 5, and 7.
21.
The majority of indicators used to measure outcomes under this pillar were country outcomes for
which CAS attribution was difficult. For example, increased agricultural value added was not measured
and was replaced by increased agricultural productivity of major crops. Other indicators that measured
higher level outcomes are maintaining single-digit inflation levels, increasing revenue-to-GDP ratios and
the expansion of private sector credit to GDP.
22.
Strong economic growth continued over the CAS period despite the fact that the space for free
private sector development remains limited. Since 2010 Ethiopia has continued to run high inflation,
recorded at 32% in January 2012 and averaging 38.1% between July 2011 and January 2012. The revenue
to GDP ratio while improved (it reached 13.6% in 2011/12 from 12.1% in 2007/8), was nonetheless lower
than expected and the target of 14.3% was missed. FDI patterns since 2007 are very volatile and generally
weaker than in the pre-crisis years. Companies from India, Turkey and China are among the leading
investors in Ethiopia; for the latter, the majority of investments focus on the manufacturing sector in
Ethiopia.

Strides were made in the road sector as road density per 1000 km2 increased from 38.6 km in
2007 to 48.1 km in 2011. The share of domestic contractors increased to 77% in 2011 from 35% in 2008.
Electrification rates reached 41% of rural towns and villages in 2011 and the number of consumers
connected grew from 800,000 in 2005, to more than 2 million in 2011. A number of activities to enhance
regional integration remain pending. Construction of power transmission lines between Ethiopia and
Sudan is complete and the power trade between the two countries is set to begin following an agreement
on prices. The Ethiopia-Kenya Interconnector project under the East Africa Power Pool is expected to be
approved in 2012 and will also contribute to regional integration. Other critical investments for growth
include the Information and Community Technology Assisted Development Project. The project
constructed 65 community ICT centers that served over 70,000 customers per month, 7 community radios
and 4 regional ICT business incubators with 55 startup company tenants. At the policy and institutional
level the project developed a foundation of policies, standards and guidelines for use of ICT in Ethiopia.
24.
According to official statistics, agricultural productivity of three major crops, wheat, teff and
sorghum, increased by an average of 14% from 2007/8 to 2010/11.11 This has increased the agricultural
income of a number of farmers close to markets, main roads and urban areas. Rice growth around the
Gondar region developed over the past few decades and recent new varieties of upland rice have become
increasingly popular allowing farmers to dictate prices to millers.
25.
Private sector development has followed three tracks over the CAS period. Privatization of stateowned enterprises reached their targets however an environment of free competition is not yet there. A
number of companies in telecom, the airline industry and shipping are not to be privatized for the time
being as they are perceived by GOE as strategic industries. Secondly, support was given to establishing a
Competition Authority under the Ministry of Trade and the Trade Practices and Consumer Protection
Proclamation was enacted in 2010. Analytical work on the transport, telecom and finance sectors was
conducted to help the GoE with its WTO accession negotiations, however little has been done in this area
in terms of actual progress. Finally, under the Private Sector Development Capacity Building Project
matching grants schemes to SME for exports have been successful and supported 50-60 firms in textile,
leather and agro-processing manufacturing to increase exports by 25%. A high-level study tour to China
and Turkey is currently under preparation to learn about different approaches to SME development and
line of credits. A number of IFC advisory services have also contributed to the development of the private
sector and improving the investment climate as mentioned previously.
26.
Improving access to and improving quality of basic services: CAS outcomes that contributed
to the country-level goal of increasing access to and quality of basic services were increasing girls
enrollment in primary and secondary education, sustainable access to potable water and sanitation
services, delivery of key health services, improving the quality of education, rolling out kebele health
11

However this data is not corroborated by other studies. According to the FAO/WFP Crop and Food Security Assessment
Mission to Ethiopia (2010) “national cereal and pulse production in 2009/10 is some 4.7 percent below the all time record harvest
in 2008/09 but still about 7 percent above the previous five years average. Sorghum and maize crops have been most adversely
affected, while production of teff and barley is less affected and production of wheat is expected to increase.” p.4.

extension packages to improve services and greater use of community radios for improved service
delivery. This pillar was predominantly supported by the PBS 2 Program and the associated Pastoral
Community Development Project 2, the General Education Quality Improvement Project (GEQIP), the
Nutrition Project, the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project, water supply and sanitation projects and ULGDP.
A large portion of the knowledge portfolio focused on this area, for example a decentralized service
delivery study, public finance reviews and a health financing policy note.
27.
Indicators on increasing access to basic services were appropriate and targets were met for the
large part. For long-term country level goal 2.3 ‘enhance citizen’s voice to improve quality of basic
services’, the indicator on the number of community radio stations in operation is weak and insufficient.
Results in this area are also demonstrated by the work on good governance under the Public Sector
Capacity Building Project which established mechanisms for citizen’s participation in rural and urban
kebeles. For example, the project supported the establishment of toll free call numbers that provide public
information to citizens. Users of these toll free numbers have increased to over 900 per day.
28.
The gender parity index increased to 90% in grades 1-4, 96% in grades 5-8, 83% in grades 9-10
and 71% in grades 11-12. Access to safe drinking water increased from 52% in 2007 to 73% in 2011 and
60% of rural households were using latrines in 2011. The proportion of malfunctioning water facilities
was reduced from 25% to 20% in 2011. Health services increased as the proportion of children vaccinated
against DPT3 reached 85% at the end of 2010.
29.
Ethiopia has made good progress in achieving the MDGs. However, as defined in the CAS,
progress on quality of services was less successful. Increasing access and simultaneously improving the
quality of services were at times contradictory goals, as the supply of trained personnel was strained by
increasing demand. Quality in education was measured by grade 5 completion rates which did not
improve much from 65% in 2006 to 69% in 2011. However, completion rates in 2009 and 2010 were
79% and 76% respectively, indicating that some improvements in quality were made but are not stable.
In terms of quality of health, the 2012 DHS shows impressive improvement in health outcomes. The CAS
outcome, rollout of health extension packages, was measured by a single indicator: percentage of births
attended by trained health personnel, which increased from 9% in 2004 to 16.6% in 2011 but missed the
target of 27%. Relying on only two indicators to measure quality does not fairly capture this outcome.
Some of the targets were also set too high, dampening a story of real progress in the area of basic
services.
30.
Reducing vulnerability: the CAS program contributed to decreasing vulnerability through
containing food insecurity, developing a long-term food security and disaster risk management strategy
and increasing investments in community-based watershed management. Results under this pillar were
supported by investment in PSNP 3, the Sustainable Land Management project and the Tana and Beles
Integrated Water Resources Development project. The knowledge portfolio supported this with Rural and
Urban Safety Nets Notes, an Urban Poverty study and an Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change
report. The CAS aimed to accelerate the demographic transition thus addressing population pressures contraceptive prevalence rates doubled to 29% over the CAS period.
31.
The indicators measuring the CAS outcomes are appropriate. The CAS outcomes provide logical
contributions to the country level goals under this pillar, except for one outlier on increasing women’s
voice within communities that does not provide a logical link to reducing population pressures (in fact
this indicator can be used to supplement the above mentioned outcome on increasing citizen’s voice to
improve basic services).
32.
An impact assessment conducted in 2010 shows that food security of chronically food-insecure
people targeted by PSNP was improved from 2006 to 2010 by 1.05 months for households participating
Page 81

in PSNP public works. 12 Supporting proxy measures show that there is a statistically significant increase
in children’s meals consumed during the lean seasons between 2006 and 2010 and that five year
participation in PSNP increased household livestock holdings by 0.38 TLU. 13 However, the overall
number of food insecure people has increased, and humanitarian assistance to so-called transient foodinsecure and other beneficiaries reached very high levels of about US$807 million per year between 2008
and 2011. This underlines the need for the GOE to focus its efforts on moving people out of poverty by
increasing opportunities in relatively high-potential rural and urban areas and to focus on agricultural
productivity increase as well as off-farm employment as more sustainable ways of improving food
security.
33.
PSNP has also played a large role in addressing land degradation through its public works
investments. Community assets built under the program have contributed to increases in the water table,
vegetation cover, species diversity, expanded use of small-scale irrigation and the construction of 119
farmer training centers. Under the Sustainable Land Management Project, 210,000 hectares of watershed
were rehabilitated from 2008 – 2011, and a further 318, 212 hectares were constructed in the PSNP public
works component. By June 2012, total investments in community-based flood management are expected
to reach US$ 5.75 million. The Federal and Regional Sustainable Land Management Platforms hold
regular meetings to provide technical guidance in the implementation of SLM activities, as established by
the TerrAfrica Initiative. Population pressure is being addressed by a doubling of the contraceptive
prevalence rate from 15% in 2004 to 29% in 2011.
34.
Fostering improved governance: CAS outcomes under this pillar aimed to improve the
performance of the public sector and enhance the capacity of local government to engage with citizens for
more responsive services. Local engagement at the woreda and kebele levels has been explicitly
encouraged by the GoE and has been supported by PBS 2, PSCAP and ULGDP. A public finance review,
Investment Climate Assessment, procurement reforms and a Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
(CIFA) also supported this pillar.
35.
Indicators on public sector performance were drawn from the Woreda/City Benchmarking
Survey, a representative survey that is routinely conducted. Results show that from 2008 to 2012 the
proportion of respondents satisfied with agriculture extension services increased from 82% to 94%,
satisfaction with solid waste services increased from 69.9% to 74%, satisfaction with water services
decreased from 60% to 58% and satisfaction with health services rose from 34% to 70%. The proportion
of people who made extra payments for general services increased from 4.3% in 2008 to 6.5% in 2011,
interpreted by some as the result of the strain that the recent crises placed on service delivery. Similarly,
those reporting extra legal payments for government health services have also risen from 5.8% to 8.5%
between 2008 and 2011.
36.
Fourteen public expenditure and financial accounting (PEFA) indicators improved out of a total
of 28, showing 50% improvement over the 2007 scores. Improvement in citizen engagement in local
government can be seen by the 75% increase in the number of citizen groups participating in the planning
process for Capital Investment Plans in 19 cities. Participatory planning of basic services is adopted in
80% of woredas that receive the Local Investment Grants in 2011. 83% of woredas have posted their
Layperson’s Budget and Service Facility Templates in 2011 and 19 cities have disseminated key
information on budgets and expenditures for 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11. Local accountability has also

seen improvements in financial reporting as all regions are now submitting their interim financial reports
in a timely manner over the last two quarters.
37.
Other outcomes: Over 60% of donor support was provided through program-based approaches,
meeting the Paris Declaration target. The largest of these were PBS, PSNP and PSCAP. A CAS outcome
on mainstreaming gender into project design was added in 2010. The indicator states that all new FY1112 lending includes gender considerations in the PDO. Gender mainstreaming has now been made a
regional priority with more appropriate measures which are used as a proxy to assess achievement of this
outcome. The Africa Gender Action Plan identifies the criteria for detailed coverage in lending as “gender
issues are discussed and presented with quantitative data and extensive background information.” A
review of FY11-12 lending shows that four out of six projects comply with GAP criteria.14 Projects such
as PBS, PSNP and Urban Local Governance promoted the participation of women in community or city
committees and women were given the opportunity to accrue an independent income through PSNP
public works.
C. Cross-cutting issues in CAS period
38.
Climate change: Issues related to climate change were addressed throughout the Bank portfolio.
Most interventions to promote development help address climate change adaptation and / or mitigation.
Good examples are projects promoting sustainable land and water management, agricultural development
including irrigation, food security and renewable energy (AGP, PSNP and SLMP). For the most part,
however, the Bank made no specific efforts to make its portfolio “climate-smart”. Some analytical work
on Climate Change was conducted in FY08 at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture and a report on
Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change (EACC) in FY11 was a deliverable for the COP16 UN
Conference on Climate Change. The analysis addressed the impact of climate change on key sectors in
Ethiopia. The GoE’s investment in the development of the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE,
2011) strategy is critical to climate change and overall development issues in Ethiopia and the region,
and the Bank should significantly increase its engagement in this area.
39.
Governance and social accountability: While some progress has been made, governance
challenges at the Federal level remained persistent. Implementation of the CAS program, with financial
management and procurement controls, did however ensure transparency, social gains and progress
towards the MDGs. The PSCAP supported the establishment of citizen participation in local government
processes, better service delivery, court reform and tax reform. Social accountability and citizen
participation has played a greater role at the local level and was part of the CAS program. Significant
components of PBS 2 are focused on a) accountability in decentralized financial services (US$ 50.2m)
and b) social accountability (US$ 21m). Financial transparency activities such as budget literacy training
to citizens and the dissemination of budgets have also created links with the PSNP and other major donorfunded programs. Awareness is not equal across all regions however, and female participation in budget
literacy remains low. Due to higher-than expected performance of cities under the Urban Local
Governance Development Project, Bank financing was doubled in 2011. The project provides a good
model for how empowered local governments and local communities can transform cities and generate
local employment.

14

PBS monitors maternal health, gender parity index in schools and women’s participation in community planning groups. The
Urban Local Government Development project monitors jobs created for women and gender mainstreaming in urban local
governments. A gender study commissioned under PSNP shows that the project had a positive impact on female beneficiaries.
The Agricultural growth project explicitly addresses gender considerations in its design.

Page 83

Overall CAS Assessment
40.
The GoE assessed achievement of its national development strategy during this period, the
PASDEP, as satisfactory. Indeed, there has been a visible increase in economic growth and investments
in strategic infrastructure paving the way for future growth. Major efforts were also made in increasing
access to basic services. The GoE’s Food Security Program was able to lower the severity of the impact
of the food crisis and Ethiopia was the only country in the Horn of Africa that did not experience famine.
The CAS supported the PASDEP in select areas that reflect the Bank’s priorities and comparative
advantage. However progress under the CAS pillars varied. Improvements on macro-economic stability,
investment climate and the quality of basic services were not as expected. Overall CAS performance is
therefore rated as Moderately Satisfactory due to uneven achievement of the outcomes under the
CAS pillars.

III. Evaluating Bank Performance
41.
The evaluation of the Bank’s performance focuses on two key dimensions: i) CAS design and ii)
implementation of the CAS program.
A. CAS Design
42.
The CAS was well aligned with the GoE’s priorities, namely the PASDEP, during the CAS
period. The Bank’s flexibility to extend the CAS by one year up to FY12 ensured compatibility with the
new GoE strategy, the GTP, which was under preparation during the CASPR. The additional year also
gave the Bank sufficient room to conduct consultations with the GoE in order to prepare its upcoming
CPS FY13-FY16. The CAS areas of engagement were based on the four main pillars which were aligned
with Ethiopia’s national development goals. The Bank pursued CAS outcomes through a mix of
investment lending and analytical advisory assistance that reflected the realities of the CAS period. Areas
of strong GoE interest (such as basic services, food security and infrastructure) were heavily supported
with investments and trust funds and were scaled up. In areas of divergence or lack of consensus (such as
structural and macroeconomic policies) support relied on AAA to maintain dialogue. A prospective PRSC
was not used in the absence of agreement between the Bank and the GoE on changes in structural issues.
The PBS Program became an alternative to direct budget support and has successfully channeled
resources to the woredas. However, as recognized in the previous CASCR, despite the successful shift in
financing modalities from budget support to the PBS in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget
support could not be fully replicated by PBS, being a more narrowly focused investment instrument. This
argues for reconsideration of budget support agenda going forward under the new CPS.
43.
The CAS program deepened partnerships with other donors. Trust Funds were well
incorporated in lending. 91% of trust funds were used to co-finance IDA lending operations in FY11,
98% of which was used to fund CAS objectives 2 and 3 (improving access and quality of basic services
and reducing vulnerabilities). In addition to creating multi-donor trust funds for PBS and PSNP, the Bank
also housed the PBS Secretariat and the PSNP Donor Coordination Team and provided other in-kind
support to the committees. The AGP, through its partnership framework, provides a basis for
strengthened and more harmonized support to agricultural growth in Ethiopia. The program has leveraged
more than US$ 100 million in addition to IDA financing. Similarly, the GEQIP (General Education
Quality Improvement Program) is financed by a group of development partners through pooled funding
arrangements. IDA financing was used to secure more than US$ 130 million for the National Nutrition
Program and the Bank led the coordination along with UNICEF. The Bank also coordinated grants under
global and regional programs such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Education for All – Fast
Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), and the Global Partnership for Output Based
Aid (GPOBA).
Page 84

44.
The expected outcomes in the CAS results framework are overall realistic. For the most part,
there are good linkages between the strategic pillars, outcomes and indicators. Targets however were set
too high given the role of the CAS as one of many contributions to the PASDEP. The inability to meet
some of these targets dampened a story of real progress in some areas.
45.
The CAS examined four groups of risks that remained relevant during the CAS period: i)
Ethiopia’s vulnerability to external shocks, in particular drought and possible regional conflict, ii) two
governance risks related to the possibility of disputes over local elections in April 2008 (and
parliamentary elections in 2010), and the ongoing military action in the Ogaden area of Ethiopia’s Somali
region to subdue separatist rebel elements, iii) macro-economic risks as a consequence of rising food and
oil prices and iv) procurement and financial management risks as a result of weak capacity and shortage
of skills at the local level. The CASPR heightened the risks related to vulnerability to external shocks and
weak capacity in procurement and financial management, and lowered those related to governance and
macro-economic stability over the period FY08 –FY10. Mitigation of risks is discussed in the following
section.
B. CAS implementation
46.
The bulk of lending activities were done through a program-based approach and the Bank
has acted as the technical lead for the majority of the activities, along with DFID and UNICEF. A
number of joint AAA have also been conducted, such as the CIFA report and the Woreda/City
Benchmarking Survey.
47.
The Bank was highly supportive of the CAS program, as evident by the high level of project
staff decentralized to the country office in Addis Ababa. Successful projects such as PBS were scaled up
to be implemented nationwide. Significant investments were also made in critical development areas
such as infrastructure (namely roads and energy access) and agriculture. The country team explored
innovative approaches, such as results-based lending, which has been welcomed by the GoE and the new
Program for Results instrument is the basis for a health project currently under preparation. Output based
lending was also used under the Energy Access project but results were delayed because of the
moratorium on electricity connections. The country team demonstrated efficiency by having one of the
lowest administrative costs to IDA allocation ratios in Africa, along with Nigeria.
48.
The Bank successfully engaged in a number of areas where the GoE has a strong program
for development. There is strong commitment and ownership to increasing access to basic services and
reducing vulnerability, as the progress towards CAS outcomes clearly shows. On the other hand, very
little traction has been made with the GoE regarding private sector development especially in policy
sensitive areas or those that may require substantial sector reform such as the financial sector and land
policy.
49.
Portfolio management and performance. Bank portfolio performance maintained strong
growth and a high disbursement ratio, while maintaining selectivity. The Ethiopia portfolio has nearly
doubled since FY08: in April 2008 net commitments were US$ 2.4 billion, compared to US$4.4 billion in
February 2012. The number of projects in the portfolio has been reduced to 25, from 30 in 2009. Since
FY09, the disbursement ratio has exceeded 30% and is on track to do so in FY12. Although the
impressive disbursement rate is unquestionably driven by fast-disbursing projects as the PBS and PSNP,
the rest of the projects have also been disbursing reasonably well, with a few exceptions. 15 Proactivity has
15

Project, Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and the Road Sector Development Stage IV APL Projects.

Page 85

been 100% except for FY10 (67%), which is another indication of good portfolio management. Average
project preparation time (IDA investments only - PE) for projects approved during the CAS period is
around 14 months16 (better than the regional average – 16-18 months), although there is wide variation
between individual projects (ranging from 4 to 27 months). As of February 2012, there were no overage
projects in the portfolio, though the average project age has increased to 5 years. This is due to only two
projects being approved since FY10. Formal restructuring, other than that carried out as part of the
support under the global food crisis response, has been practically non-existent (3 restructurings
altogether during the CAS period). IEG evaluations of completed projects concluded that some of the
projects should have been restructured or, if they had been, the restructuring was too late or not deep
enough. During the CAS period there were eleven additional financings, showing good use of the
instrument. However, three of the additional financings were for projects whose funds had been
previously deployed to the Global Food Crisis Response Project, which suggests that there was some
trade-off between the affected projects and the emergency response.
50.
Projects at risk have been relatively high, reaching 28% in FY08 and FY11, though associated
commitments at risk have been comparatively lower (FY08 being an exception), indicating that risks are
rather related with smaller projects. Actual problem projects, however, are 10% on average over the CAS
period, which, if compared to outcome ratings in IEG evaluations of completed projects during the same
period (8 projects evaluated, 37% unsatisfactory outcome ratings), suggests that ratings assessments
during implementation may have been optimistic. That said, the net disconnect for Ethiopia (12.5%) is
nearly half the AFR region’s (22%), and effectively reflects a net disconnect for one project.
51.
IEG reviews of projects that closed during the CAS period highlighted shortcomings in the
quality of M&E design, implementation and utilization. To advance policy dialogue, maintaining and
tracking data sources is a necessary condition. Ethiopia continues to have weak data collection and
capacity. For this the Bank may need to engage collaboratively with the statistical agency in Ethiopia to
improve country data systems and improve data collection for Bank projects.
52.
The total amount allocated for core knowledge products over the CAS period was US$ 5.2
million, 80% of which was for economic and social sector work (ESW) and 20% for technical assistance
(TA). 46% of the analytical and advisory activities (AAA) supported the CAS objective ‘fostering
economic growth’ and 45% was linked to the CAS objectives ‘improving access and quality of basic
services’ and ‘reducing vulnerabilities’, the majority of which are linked to education and social services.
Only 7% of AAA outside project budgets supported infrastructure lending. 39% of the knowledge budget
was used to address public finance, macro-economic and private sector development themes however
with limited traction on these topics. There is little evidence that analytical advisory work was
disseminated and discussed with stakeholders beyond the core GoE counterparts.
53.
The Bank was quick to respond to the 2008 global food and fuel crisis through the
Emergency Food Crisis Response Program. The program had two parts, additional financing to the
PSNP and the Fertilizer Support Project. The Fertilizer Support Project was designed to ensure an
aggregate supply of chemical fertilizers for 2009 – 2010 in order to prevent a fall in agricultural output
which would have exacerbated the food crisis. This was financed through re-deploying financing from 12
existing projects and additional Bank financing (total US$ 250m). The project was approved in three
months, an exceptionally quick response by the Bank. However, the IEG evaluation questioned the sole
importer arrangement with the GoE, the logistics of fertilizer distribution, and the efficiency of having
foreign exchange resources locked in fertilizer stocks.
16

Excluding additional financing and outliers such as the Global Food Crisis Response Project (2.7 months preparation time) and
the Ethiopia - Sudan Interconnector Project (43 months).

Page 86

54.
The Bank was slower to respond to the 2008-2010 moratorium imposed by the GoE on
electricity connections, halting the implementation of the entire energy portfolio for the duration of that
period. In retrospect, it was difficult to foresee when the moratorium would have ended. The risk,
however, was already present at the time of the CASPR and the document should have discussed the
challenges facing the energy portfolio.
55.
The CASPR was used to reflect on the initial CAS period, to validate continued relevance of
CAS objectives and identified risks. No major course correction was made during the CASPR.
Revisions to the results matrix were made, the number of core outcomes was reduced to 22 and 39
indicators (down from 26 and 51 respectively), including adding the core sector indicators. The CASPR
attempted to mainstream gender considerations and dropped indicators on a regional road network,
growth corridor and support to rural diversification due to slow progress in these areas.
56.
The mitigation of risks during the CAS period was mixed, with a few unforeseen risks
arising. To mitigate the risk of extreme weather events, the Bank supported the GoE to prepare a disaster
risk management strategy. The worst effects of the recent (2008 and 2011) droughts were mitigated
through the PSNP. Vulnerability to the food crisis was mitigated by portfolio restructuring to support
urgent investments in food security and boosting fertilizer supplies to boost agricultural production. The
sharp decline in fertilizer prices in 2009 could not have been expected and resulted in excess funds
allocated to the Ethiopia Global Food Crisis Response Project, which were re-directed to PBS 2.
Macroeconomic risk did not stabilize as anticipated and, following the conclusion of the IMF program in
2010, inflation peaked to nearly 40% in late 2011. Monetary policy remains a concern. The expected
post-election violence in 2010 did not occur while the security risks related to operating in the Somali
region meant that operations did not take place there over the CAS period. The CASPR anticipated that
drought could affect hydropower generation but offered no mitigation measures.

IV. Lessons Learnt and Suggestions for New CPS
CAS focus
57.
Realizing Ethiopia’s full potential and achieving GTP economic and social targets would require
stable macroeconomic framework and increased role of the private sector. It is therefore important for
the Bank to find ways to engage more effectively with GoE in policy dialogue on macroeconomic
issues and private and financial sector issues. The CAS acknowledged the limitations in policy
dialogue and relied mostly on analytical advisory work to engage GoE on structural reform matters,
which had limited impact. Increasing the relevance of the Bank’s ESW, through providing more
flexible/just in time policy pieces requested by the GoE, could contribute to improved dialogue. In terms
of financial assistance, it might be important for the Bank to offer the Government a range/menu of
instruments available to support private sector growth and facilitation, including guarantees, credit lines
as well as a complementary package of services provided by the IFC and MIGA.
58.
Additional suggestions for improving Bank Group engagement in the area of private sector
development include: (i) strengthening public-private partnership for advancing dialogue and (ii)
leveraging on partnership with other development partners to align key messages to the
Government in some of the challenging areas.
59.
GoE’s efforts to stabilize the effect of the 2008 food crisis and 2011 drought through programs
such as PSNP were relatively successful, but overall the absolute number of people who were food
insecure has increased over the period 2006-2010. This result indicates that a more comprehensive
solution for food security is required, which would include but not be limited to the GoE’s current Food
Page 87

Security Program. Given population pressure and the possible negative effects of climate change, it
would be important for the Bank to support the GoE’s efforts on moving people out of poverty by
increasing opportunities for on and off-farm employment as a more sustainable way of improving food
security in the medium to long term. Support to private sector and agribusiness would constitute an
important part of this agenda going forward.
60.
While recognizing the important role of employment generation as an additional way of
improving food security in the medium to long-term, the Bank also acknowledges that there will be a
portion of the population that remains highly vulnerable, particularly in the context of increasing
uncertainties around climate change. In terms of addressing the policy and program responses to
vulnerability, the Bank should continue to support and strengthen social protection systems and
invest in disaster risk management programs.
61.
In addition to supporting GoE focus on access to basic services, the Bank needs to more
actively engage in improving the quality of basic services. The PASDEP was centered on achieving the
MDGs which focused on access to basic services, creating a trade-off with the quality of these services.
As experience showed, all focus during the CAS period was directed to increasing access, crowding out
efforts to improve quality. Challenges to improving quality will be critical if the benefits from higher
access are to be fully materialized in the longer term. Utilizing a newly approved instrument – Program
for Results (P4R) – might provide a good opportunity for the Bank to shift its focus from access to
quality.
62.
Bridging the data and knowledge gap for evidence-based dialogue: An important and
common challenge in Ethiopia is the scarcity and reliability of data sources. To advance policy dialogue,
maintaining and tracking data sources is a necessary condition. Ethiopia continues to have weak data
collection and capacity. For this the Bank may need to engage collaboratively with the statistical agency
in Ethiopia to improve country data systems. At the same time, where possible, Bank projects should
build in their design both rigorous impact evaluations and continuous monitoring to adjust design
parameters as and when needed.
CAS Design
63.
Built-in flexibility and mitigations measures ensure more adequate response to identified
risks at the project level: PSNP was designed with the flexibility to anticipate and scale up in the
possibility of a shock, through its risk financing mechanism. In comparison, the energy portfolio, while
identifying solutions to the long-term challenges that face the sector, did not have an adequate response
on hand for the moratorium. The diversification of activities under the energy portfolio and not solely
focusing on access projects may reduce this risk.
64.
At the portfolio level better emergency responses need to be designed in countries that are
prone to disasters such as Ethiopia. The portfolio restructuring in response to the food crisis was quick
but it was a time and labor-intensive exercise and funds may not always be available if a future crisis
were to occur.
65.
Careful thought should be put into linking lending and non-lending instruments with the
indicators and the CAS outcomes that form a logical results framework. This will help to avoid
disconnect between the outcomes and indicators. It is particularly important to avoid pitfalls in using
high-level indicators that are beyond the scope of the CAS. This was most evident in the lack of
achievement of outcomes under pillar 1.

Page 88

CAS Implementation
66.
Monitoring the CAS results framework more regularly will help maintain realistic targets
and flag deficiencies in outcome indicators. The CPPR can be used as an opportunity to check progress
on the future CPS results framework in preparation for the CASPR and CASCR stages. This would
ensure that data is available and efforts are being made to strengthen the quality of the results framework.
67.
Recognition of the unique advantages of budget support. Despite the successful shift in
financing modalities from budget support to the PBS in reaction to the 2005 crisis, the benefits of budget
support could not be fully replicated by PBS, as a more narrowly focused investment instrument. Budget
support provided an important forum for dialogue, especially on issues related to growth and structural
reforms. In addition, the multi-donor dialogue fostered by budget support enhanced donor harmonization
and reduced transaction costs. These factors argue for the resumption of budget support agenda going
forward under the new CPS.
68.
Programmatic approaches which can be scaled up tend to be successful, by leveraging
greater resources from partners, disbursing faster, and having greater flexibility.17 Such models can also
help build country systems in the sectors they are operating in. The future CPS should seek to replicate
this model where possible.

17

Good examples include the Nutrition Project, PBS and PSNP.

The ambitious targets set
have downplayed actual
real progress that has been
made on these outcomes.
Furthermore, relying on
only two indicators to
measure quality does not
fairly capture this outcome.
The indicator used is a
weak measure of the use of

improved service delivery.

Using days as the unit of
measure is not consistent
with the available data,
which uses months as its
unit of measure. The

Appendix 5: Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA)1
1.
The DSA shows that Ethiopia remains at a low risk of external debt distress in 2012.
However, vulnerabilities remain as the most extreme stress test indicates. The debt burden
indicators remain below the policy dependent-thresholds for the whole projection period
including all stress tests. Even though the external debt ratio remains within thresholds, it shows
sensitivity to changes in the terms of new public sector loans. Although most of macro indicators
and assumptions have slightly changed (downward) compared to the projections in the previous
2011 DSA, the present value (PV) of external debt to exports remains at similar levels (around
97 percent). The projection of new debt disbursement was lower than in last year’s DSA estimate
as disbursement of loans to public infrastructure investment is estimated to slow down.
Furthermore, public infrastructure investment, as planned in the GTP, relies heavily on financing
from domestic sources. Pursuing the full implementation of the investment plan in the originally
envisioned time frame may lead to a large accumulation of public debt and could have
implications of crowding the private sector. Ethiopia has substantial levels of foreign exchange
receipts from remittances. Since the baseline and sensitivity tests without remittances do not
breach any of the country specific thresholds, the analysis of DSA focuses on the method that
does not consider remittances.
2.
The 2012 DSA baseline scenario shows a rising path of public and publicly guaranteed
external debt over the next few years, but will remain well under the various thresholds (see
figures below). The PV of external debt in percent of exports will slowly increase peaking at
106.7 percent in 2017 and continue declining over the projection period. A similar trend is
observed for the PV of debt to GDP and revenue. The debt service to exports is projected to
remain well below the threshold; it will peak at 8.9 percent in 2019 and declines afterwards on
account of the expectation of servicing non-concessional borrowing by public enterprises.
3.
Under the historical scenario, the debt stock indicators are lower than under the baseline
scenario in the short term but would rise slightly above those of the baseline scenario over time.
The PV of debt to exports is projected to fall over the next five years by 23 percentage points
from current levels before beginning to rise to a peak of 94.8 percent. The most extreme test
which is characterized by new public sector loans negotiated on less favorable terms (200 basis
point higher interest rate during the forecast horizon), would show a substantial increase to a
peak of 145.7 percent (very close to the threshold), but decline after 2020. This is the result of
the recent and further expected disbursement in non-concessional terms for public infrastructure
investment.
4.
With regard to total public sector debt (external and domestic sources), under the baseline
scenario, the total public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would rise in the medium term. In addition to
an accumulation of external public and publicly-guaranteed debt, a significant amount of
domestic financing is projected to occur through major public enterprises, particularly the state1

with the IMF. The DSA document has not yet been published.

owned electricity company, which continues to run operating losses and plans to invest heavily.
Among others, the Grand Renascence Dam is expected to be financed largely from domestic
sources.
5.
In summary, DSA 2012 indicates that Ethiopia stays at a low risk of external debt distress
– similar to the findings in 2009/10 and 2010/11. But given the large financing requirements for
the GTP, it is expected that debt ratios would rise moderately in the medium-term but stabilize in
the long-term. New disbursement projections reflect the fact that borrowing from domestic
sources is capacity constrained and public enterprises would continue to rely significantly on
external financing to sustain its large infrastructure investments that are driving growth; for the
latter it has to be expected that a growing share would be on non-concessional terms. Consistent
with GoE's intention to keep a low risk of external debt distress, the amount of non-concessional
borrowing will be limited. Indeed there may be a trade-off between GoE’s desire to maintain a
low risk rating and the implementation pace of the GTP. In other words, GoE may need to
increase the implementation period of the GTP in order to smooth the profile of the nonconcessional financing requirements for the planned investments. Ethiopia is subject to the IDA
Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP). In the absence of an IMF program, IDA could
establish a non-concessional borrowing limit if it was consistent with the maintenance of low
debt vulnerabilities, and if the planned investments are critical and growth-enhancing.2 The GoE
officially requested a non-concessional borrowing limit of US$ 1 billion and the Board will be
informed of IDA management’s decision as specified in the NCBP.

2

The ability to establish a non-zero ceiling for non-concessional lending in IDA's NCBP in the absence of an IMF
program was outlined in "IDA's Non-concessional Borrowing Policy: Progress Update", April, 2010. (IDA Sec
54240)

Appendix 6: Analysis of Gender Inequalities and Opportunities in
Ethiopia3
1.
The Government of Ethiopia’s (GoE) has a strong commitment to gender equality, which
is firmly rooted in national policies as well as in the signing of international and regional treaties
and protocols on women’s rights. Promoting gender equality is a central element in the GoE
Growth and Transformation Plan 2010/11-2014/15 and its cross cutting sectors theme (Chapter
8) identifies a range of gender concerns. The Ministry of Women, Youth and Children’s Affairs
contribute to policy development and support gender mainstreaming in all government ministries
and bureaus and spearhead responses to address gender inequalities. To date gender units have
been established in all line ministries and in the regions. However, implementation capacity
remains a challenge.
2.
The gaps in women’s and men’s development opportunities are significant, and there is
ample room for reduction in the country’s gender inequality. The literacy levels of women are
markedly lower than those of men, especially in rural areas and among urban poor. In education,
the retention level of girls in secondary education is lower than that of boys, and the gender gap
is steep in tertiary education. Despite having 28 percent female parliamentarians, women are
generally under-represented in decision-making (only 3 of the ministers are women). There is a
pronounced gender gap in access to and control of productive resources. Although they
contribute to much of the agricultural labor, women’s access to land continues to be limited
despite joint land certification efforts. As a consequence their access to farm inputs, extension
advice and credit are way below men’s, what slows down land productivity and the country’s
economic growth. Women lack economic opportunities, have limited involvement in cash crop
production, non-farm enterprises and wage employment. Harmful cultural practices (such as
female genital mutilation (FGM) and early marriages) are widely practiced and gender based
violence is widespread. Climatic changes, HIV/AIDS and other livelihood stresses put women’s
participation in the economy, society and in education further at risk. There is also considerable
heterogeneity across region and location (rural vs. urban). Indicators of empowerment show
increasing disparities between the best and worst performing regions, reflecting in part the
deterioration of some indicators in the worst performing regions. Further, while progress has
been made gender disparities persist, with regions that were ranked poorly in 1995 and 2005 are
still lagging in 2011.4
3.
While reducing the large gender gaps in Ethiopia is an important development goal in its
own right, it is well established that improving gender equality in the country would lead to large
leaps in achieving many of the other key development goals. World Bank (2008) estimates
indicate that reducing basic gender inequalities in education and the labor market could increase
the annual GDP growth in Ethiopia by around 1.9 percentage points – which would be an
important contribution to poverty reduction given the elasticity of growth to poverty reduction.
3

The analysis is based on a comprehensive Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 2000,
2005 and 2011.
4
For example, the Gender Parity Index (the ratio of girls to boys attending school) in secondary net schooling
attendance was 0.42 in Somali region, while it was 1.08 in Tigray – a difference that has been persistent over the
years (DHS, 2011, section2.6.3).

Page 109

Evidence from other countries confirm that under-investing in women limits economic growth
and slows down poverty reduction (2012 WDR). Moreover, evidence across the globe links
increases in women’s productivity and earnings to lower household poverty and to better health
and education outcomes for household members, especially children.
Reduced gender inequalities in primary education, but adult education still needs attention
4.
The policies to ensure gender equality in education in Ethiopia are elaborated in the
Education and Training Policy (April 1994) and the Education Sector Development Program IV,
2010. The GoE Educational Statistics Annual Abstract FY11 shows an increase in the female
Gross Enrollment Rate for primary education (grades 1-8) from 84% in FY06 to 93% in FY11.
The girls/boys ratio for 1-4 grade worsened from 95% in FY07 to 90% in FY11, while the ratio
for grade 5 to 8 improved in the same period, from 88% to 96%. Improvements continue for
secondary enrolment – female GER for grades 9-10 increased from 25% in FY06 to 35% in
FY11, while male GER is relatively stable around 42-45%. Hence, the girls/boys ratio in
secondary education increases – from 59% in FY06 to 83% in FY10. Average drop-out rates in
primary school have been approximately the same for boys and girls during the last 7 years. In
2011, 51% of women between 15 and 49 years of age did not have any education compared to
29% of men compared to 75% of women and 52% of men in 2000 (Table below). Secondary
school attendance shows a much less favorable picture with very low rates for both girls and
boys and the numbers are actually declining. Very few people have more than secondary school
in Ethiopia and the gender difference in tertiary education and above is large. Even though the
growth in shares with this level of educational attainment has been high, the shares remain low.
Only 4 percent of women have education higher than secondary, while the corresponding figure
for men is 7 percent.

Women’s health continues to be of major concern
5.
Maternal mortality remains at alarmingly high rates, despite being considered among the
most important indicators of women wellbeing and one of the Millennium Development Goals.
Use of contraceptives doubled from 2005 to 2011 (from 15% to 29%), family planning increased
from 25% of households to 60% in the same period and population growth is declining in
Ethiopia (Ethiopia Population and Housing Census 2007). Fertility declined 10% from 2005 to
2011 while adolescent fertility was reduced 35% in the same period. Despite fewer births per
women and expectations of reduced maternal mortality ratio 5 , especially among very young
5

Maternal Mortality Ratio is defined as the number of deaths during pregnancy, childbirth or the first 2 months of
childbirth per 100.000 live births.

Page 110

women, maternal mortality remains stubbornly high (673 deaths per 100.000 live births in 2005
and 676 in 2011).
6.
Women with poor nutritional status have higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and
hence anemia is of particular importance for this group. The reduction of anemia in women has
been large in Ethiopia from 2005 to 2011 - actually more than twice the reduction in anemia in
children in the same period. The DHS 2005 and 2011 show the share of women suffering from
moderate and severe anemia has been more than halved in this period, while there has been a 25
percent reduction in the share with mild anemia. The reduction has been higher in urban areas,
although the urban-rural difference is much lower than what is found for children. Severe anemia
was almost eliminated in urban areas as the share declined by 85 percent. Nonetheless, the
prevalence of anemia in women is still high and the gap between men and women in 2011 shows
the disadvantaged situation of women (prevalence of anemia is twice as high in urban women as
that of urban men, while it is 40 percent higher for rural women as compared to rural men).
Significant benefits to be gained from gender equalizing policies in the economic sector
7.
In accessing jobs, Ethiopian women’s opportunities to leverage their labor in the market
are hindered by their limited skills and greater burden of household responsibilities. As a result,
women face lower economic activity rates6, lower employment rates and higher unemployment
rates than men. They are also disproportionately concentrated in unpaid or flexible jobs that offer
lower earnings and less security and their ability to move to better jobs is limited by some form
of labor market discrimination/segmentation. Factors such as location and age are also correlated
with worse labor market outcomes. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs of progress
in Ethiopia when it comes to women’s participation in the economy. The economic activity rate
is equalizing among the younger cohorts in urban areas as it increased 10 percent for young
women (age 20-34) from 2009 to 2011 while there was no change for young men. Still, the
gender gaps in the urban economy remains very large: the female unemployment rate is twice as
large as that of males in 2011, women earn 50 percent less than men, the share of women without
education is double that of men, microenterprises owned by women earn only a fraction of those
owned by men and women face larger barriers for doing business.
8.
Around 45 percent of the differences in earnings between men and women in Ethiopia
can be explained by worker characteristics, while as much as 40 percent of the gap is
unexplained. Among workers characteristics, lower investments in human capital and less
experience on the job account for 25 to 39 percent of the gap in earnings between men and
women. Job characteristics are also systematically less favorable for women. Independent of
their observable individual characteristics, women are more likely to end up in less rewarding
segments of the labor market, pointing to some implicit form of job discrimination, particularly
for the younger wage employed. Finally, about 40 percent of the wage gap cannot be explained
based on observable individual or job characteristics. In the economics literature this
6

According to ILO definition, economically active means to be working to produce goods and/or services for others
or for own consumption, or actively seeking such work (i.e. includes unemployed). Unpaid household chores such
as preparing food, cleaning the house and taking care of children are not considered economic activities. The
economic activity rate measures the share of the population that is economically active to the total population.

Page 111

unexplained gap is referred to as “pure wage discrimination effects” as it implies that individuals
with identical characteristics other than their gender are not being paid the same. This
discrimination effect appears to be more marked as the age of the workers increases.
9.
Gender equality is legally provided for in business ownership and administration,
although in practice biases remain. The literature suggests that Ethiopian culture discourages
women from taking up a career in business. Instead, women’s core activities are often perceived
as reproductive tasks. This image leads to some specific bottlenecks, such as women’s ability to
travel away from home, own larger animals, and even control their own independent income
(ILO, 2003). Families of growth-oriented women would often frown upon their business
initiatives and many women who would like to go into business cannot because their families or
husbands do not allow them (TriodosFacet 2011). For the same reason, many women face
cultural obstacles to grow their small business. Also, women are culturally pressed into
traditional ‘women businesses’ such as food preparation, hairdressing, and textile production
confirming the segmentation identified above (Stevenson and St. Onge, 2005). Analysis of the
latest investment climate assessment data revealed that women face greater barriers at start up.
Likewise, results from the Rural Investment Climate Survey for Amhara suggest that women are
more likely than men to do activities with low capital requirements and low productivity (and
often bearing social stigma) because of lack of other options, as opposed to men entrepreneurs
whose businesses tend to be much larger and much more profitable. Further, non-farm
enterprises owned by women in rural areas and urban towns tend to be much smaller and less
productive than men’s.
10.
Gender equality in land tenure, property ownership and inheritance is guaranteed by
legislation, which also recognizes the legal presumption of joint property by spouses. Yet in
practice biases persist, particularly towards single women. In some regions such as Amhara and
Tigray efforts have been made to ensure equal land use rights for women. The most significant
development in the recent past in this area has been the programs of land certification
implemented in the four main regions of the country. More than 20 million land-use certificates
have been issued with both spouses’ names and photos on the certificates, and women’s
registration for land increased significantly. Some of the benefits of those programs are already
becoming apparent and a recent nationwide survey indicated that more than 80 percent of
households expected rural land certification to improve women’s position and women
respondents who had received a joint certificate almost universally pointed to this as having
improved their economic and social status. Nonetheless, there is still scope for improvements in
gender-mainstreaming of these programs and of their implementation on the ground.
Women lack access to justice
11.
Progress in the legal framework was achieved in 2005 when the Family and Penal Codes
were purged of gender biases, the minimum age for marriage was raised to 18 and important
concepts such as rape were broadened and domestic violence specifically listed as a crime. All
new legislation is now systematically reviewed through gender lenses, reflecting a commitment
by the government to close the gender gap. Ethiopia has signed, but not ratified the Women’s
Rights Protocol to the African Charter, which entered into force in November 2005. Nonetheless,
evidence suggests violence against women in Ethiopia is among the highest in the world – 70%
have been assaulted by their partner (WHO 2006) and domestic violence in Ethiopia can increase
Page 112

when women enter formal employment (WDR, 2012). The 2011 Demographic and Health
Survey found that 68 percent of all Ethiopian women believe that such violence is justified for
one reason or another (down from 81 percent in 2005). Abduction of young girls and of female
genital cutting continues to be major problems in many parts of the country. The introduction of
the Charities and Societies Proclamation law (CSO law) in 2010 has negatively affected the
NGOs that promote gender equality, especially the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association
(which played a crucial role in changing the legislation towards gender neutrality in 2004-05).
12.
In urban areas, more advanced women entrepreneurs face more severe challenges than
their male counterparts and appear to suffer especially from vulnerability to crime, corruption
and extortion. Most micro and small business owners fear taking their disputes to courts. There
seems to be a general perception that going to formal courts is waste of time and that those with
the most resources will win the case anyway. Hence, many entrepreneurs prefer settling disputes
through mediation, arbitration or other means including at the cost of unofficial payments and
undue loss of revenues.
Recommendations
13.
In education and health, the aims are given from GTP, MDG and Bank priorities. The
WB programs will promote GOE efforts to raise the girls/boys ratio for both primary and
secondary education enrolment and completion. Given the potential for adult education for
women, skill development/strengthening programs (e.g., vocational and entrepreneurial training)
for women will be promoted. In health, continued efforts to reduce fertility will be prioritized
together with interventions that are credible for reducing maternal mortality ratios. Women’s
entrepreneurship is increasingly recognized as an important untapped source of economic
growth. The Bank will build on the experiences from WEDP and the emerging research in the
area to further support growth-oriented women and men micro and small enterprise owners. In
access to justice the main opportunity for the Bank is to support enforcement of existing laws
and regulations. Bank in collaboration with the Government and other development partners will
consider supporting low-level low-cost business dispute resolution mechanisms, for both women
and men.
14.
The Bank will intensify its AAA to assist the GoE to deliver on its national gender
commitments and improve on its gender equality indicators. There is a clear need for more
rigorous impact evaluations to inform the design of programs in a range of Bank supported
programs. Continued assistance will be provided to support the collection of sex-disaggregated
data. The Bank is currently conducting studies of Access to Justice of Poor and Vulnerable
Groups in Addis Ababa to inform the future engagement. There are substantial knowledge gaps
on the impacts of supporting female income generation and under the WEDP a rigorous impact
evaluation will be undertaken.

Appendix 7: Mainstreaming Climate Change into WB Program
1.
The Government and the Bank regard climate change and variability as an
important challenge for Ethiopia. As the Government puts it in its Vision of a Climate
Resilient Green Economy (CRGE): “Ethiopia did not cause climate change, but we are
confronted by the threat that it poses, and should recognize the opportunity that it presents.
Climate change is not a future possibility for Ethiopia, it is a present reality.”
2.
Ethiopia’s climate is changing and expected to change further at unprecedented
rates. Ethiopia has become warmer over the past century and, as predicted by most climate
change models, human induced climate change will bring further warming, likely associated
with heat waves and higher evapotranspiration. While there is uncertainty about future rainfall
amounts, rainfall variability is predicted to increase further, likely leading to more droughts and
floods and other challenging impacts.
3.
Ethiopia is highly vulnerable to climate change and variability. Roughly 85 percent
of the population are living in rural areas and are heavily dependent on rainfed agriculture;
about 10 percent of the population is chronically food-insecure and several million more people
fall into transitory food insecurity each year; more than a third of all Ethiopians fall under the
food-poverty line (2010/11). The threat to this population from further climate variability and
climate change is high. As stated in the WB report “Economics of Adaptation to Climate
Change “: “Ethiopia is heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture, and its geographical location
and topography in combination with low adaptive capacity entail a high vulnerability to the
impacts of climate change.” While the threat from droughts and floods on agriculture might
lead to the largest and most acute impacts, Ethiopia is also vulnerable in terms of other sectors
including water, transport, industry, energy, health and in terms of its environmental resources.
4.
Ethiopia has also significant mitigation potential and GoE aim is a carbon neutral
growth trajectory. This is emphasized by the Government it the CRGE Vision. Its Green
Economy Strategy is based on four pillars including (i) improved crop and livestock practices;
(ii) forestry; (iii) renewable energy; and (iv) “leapfrogging to modern and energy-efficient
technologies in transport, industrial sectors, and buildings.” A major emphasis will have to be
on agriculture and forestry, which “contribute around 45% and 25% respectively to projected
GHG emission levels under business-as-usual assumptions and together account for around 80%
of the total abatement potential.” Given the ambitious CRGE agenda, changes will be required
in policies, regulations and institutions as well as program designs and financial support.
5.
This CPS addressed climate change as a cross-cutting issue. It sees climate change as
a challenge and opportunity to be addressed as part of and integrated into the development
process, and the Bank’s support to the development process as outlined under the two pillars
(Fostering Competitiveness & Employment; Enhanced Resilience & Reduced Vulnerabilities)
and various sectors of this CPS. This is in line with the CRGE and how climate change aspects
are being integrated into the GTP.
6.
Consequently, this CPS first and foremost emphasizes the Bank’s support to key
sectors of crucial importance to climate change, including agricultural and pastoral
Page 114

development, sustainable land management and food security, and renewable energy.
Supporting the development of these sectors are expected to lead to ‘win-wins’, i.e., an
economic development that is making the country and its people more resilient and that is
‘green’ (low-carbon). In addition, the Bank is planning to undertaken work focusing on
climate change. It will build on its work specific to climate change during the past CAS period7
and further strengthen its support to Government’s demands including:
 Further strengthen the Bank’s climate change focus under this CPS. Specifically, it is
proposed to strengthen the systematic and enhanced treatment of climate impacts at the
strategic level. This would build on a framework that will be developed for IDA-16 based
on selected case studies. Specifically, the work would help to provide climate change impact
analysis at the strategic level, propose sector guidelines for 3 climate sensitive sectors:
agriculture, water, and roads infrastructure, and seek to develop an institutional assessment
tool (or scorecard) which will allow Ethiopia to understand their capacity needs and gaps.
This work could provide further strategic direction and, therefore, enhance the
mainstreaming of climate resilience during implementation of this CPS.
 Support and actively engage in the CRGE initiatives. In particular through its engagement
with line agencies, the Bank will support the development of the Government’s Climate
Resilient Strategy.8 During the CPS period, the Bank also plans to support the “I-Planning”
(implementation and investment-planning) progress led by the Government. In particular,
we put a strong emphasis in engaging with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of
Water and Energy and other relevant line agencies as well as the Regions in strengthening
the integration of the I-Planning process with the development strategies and plan of the
various sectors.
 Support the Government in making the Bank-supported investment portfolio more ‘climatesmart’. In particular, climate change acting at spatial and temporal scales has implications,
including on the interactions and trade-offs within and between sectors. The Bank’s
engagement in the “I-Planning” process is crucial for this ‘mainstreaming’ of climate
change into the development processes and the Bank’s portfolio. In addition, we strengthen
our engagement in specific studies and trials under ongoing or for future projects and
programs with the aim to modify their design for an increased climate change impact.
Examples are the work already started to make the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP)
more response to the challenges and opportunities of climate change, and the planned work
to do the same for the Sustainable Land Management Program (SLMP) and the Agricultural
Growth Program (AGP).
 Continue engaging in few climate change-specific tasks such as climate information systems
or other specific AAA products or supporting the agenda on Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). However, as much as possible, these
activities will also be integrated into and supporting the Government’s and Bank-supporting
‘development’ interventions.

7

Examples include the Humbo Assisted Natural Regeneration Project assisted by the BioCabon Fund, the Scaling
Up Renewable Energy in Low Income Countries (SREP) for Ethiopia or the AAA work on economic adaptation to
climate change referred to above.
8
The CR Strategy will complement the already existing GE Strategy and is expected to be completed before the end
of 2012.

Item

Cost Sharing
Limit on the proportion of individual
project costs that the Bank may
finance

Recurrent Cost Financing
Any limits that would
apply to the overall
amount of recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may
finance

Local Cost Financing
Are the requirements for Bank
financing of local expenditures met,
namely that: (i) financing
requirements for the country’s
development program would exceed
the public sector’s own resources
(e.g., from taxation and other
revenues) and expected domestic
borrowing; and (ii) the financing of
foreign expenditures alone would
not enable the Bank to assist in the
financing of individual projects

Parameter

Up to
100%

No
country
-level
limit.

Yes

Remarks/Explanation
The actual financing share will be determined during the preparation of each new
project, and will typically be around 90% of total project costs. Bank financing
up to 100% will apply selectively to individual projects, on a case-by-case
merit/justification basis, including operations supporting reform efforts and
addressing most basic human development needs, including but not necessarily
limited to food security and safety nets, health, education, rural water supply, and
HIV/AIDS. Higher than average share of Bank financing could be applied to
specific CDD projects, IDF grants, and others where the in-kind contribution by
beneficiaries is difficult to measure. The strong emphasis on borrower ownership
to individual projects will continue.
In determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in individual projects, the Bank
will take into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels,
including implied future budgetary outlays. The approach to recurrent cost
financing will be the following. First, project costing in the PAD will specifically
include estimates of recurrent costs implications, and will outline what are the
plans to phase out Bank financing of recurrent costs, and phase in Government’s
absorption of these costs, when the project is finished. In sectors where a
tax/user-fee arrangement is considered essential for sustainability (e.g., roads),
the Bank will also take this into account in determining appropriateness and level
of recurrent cost financing. Second, the project will include a brief explanation of
the relative share of recurrent costs, per year, compared to the most recent
recurrent expenditure information for the sector where the project will be located.
Third, the aggregate of recurrent costs estimated in the whole portfolio will be
examined within the context of the overall composition of public expenditure,
during the annual review of the national budget. This examination will focus on
fiscal sustainability issues, and the schedule of progressively integrating the share
of Bank financing of recurrent costs into the MEFF to show how Government
will absorb these costs (implied future budgetary outlays), as Bank financed
projects reach completion. The Bank will continue to monitor the overall fiscal
and debt situation, in coordination with the IMF, and as part of the institutional
processes around the PRSP (APR-JSAN, JBAR, PRSCs, and country strategies).

Ethiopia meets the two requirements for local cost financing. The Bank can
finance local costs in any proportions required by individual projects.

The Bank may finance the costs of taxes and duties associated with project
expenditures, as there are currently no taxes that are deemed to be unreasonable
None
or discriminatory. The final decision, however, will rest at the project level, when
the project team assesses whether taxes and duties specific to the project
activities financed constitute an excessively high share of project costs.
NOTE: The country financing parameters for Ethiopia set out below have been approved by the Regional Vice President, Africa
Region, and are being posted on the Bank’s internal website. Date: February 2, 2006 Currently the country financing parameters for
Ethiopia are being reviewed.
Taxes and Duties
