EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-15 is the first to be prepared since
Kosovo declared independence in February 2008 and became a member of the World Bank Group
(WBG) in mid-2009. The CPS follows a series of Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs) implemented over the
last decade and is closely aligned with the national development priorities set by the Government.
ii.
With high and persistent rates of poverty and unemployment (particularly among youth
and women), the central development challenge confronting Kosovo today concerns how to forge an
economic growth path that sustainably creates more opportunity and high-quality jobs for its
growing, youthful population. Kosovo’s growth model has thus far been based largely on public
investment and the availability of external sources of financing—especially donor assistance and
remittances. This model is likely to be unsustainable for the longer term, implying the need for a viable
alternative approach. Private-sector investment, which has begun to emerge, is the most promising avenue
for generating accelerated growth and jobs in the future but is affected critically by infrastructure
bottlenecks, especially persistent shortages of energy. Besides acting as a brake on business growth,
frequent load shedding (power cuts) deprives people of light, space heating, refrigeration and cooking
fuel—with obvious implications for health, education, and the overall quality of life. Addressing the
energy crisis in a comprehensive way is thus a critical component of Government’s strategy for creating a
hospitable climate for investment, jobs, and better living standards.
iii.
Taking into account both the limited IDA resources available and Kosovo’s implementation
constraints, the proposed new lending program is highly selective. The aim is to support fewer, larger
operations in sectors/sub-sectors where the WBG has a comparative advantage by virtue of previous
experience and analytical work in Kosovo and synergies between IDA, IFC and MIGA. The choice of
operations included in the CPS program takes into account Government ownership of the agenda and
alignment with the country’s overarching goal of closer integration with the EU.
iv.
The main objectives of the CPS are to support Kosovo to (i) accelerate broad-based
economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) improve environmental management. The
goal of accelerating growth and employment creation is a continuation of the priorities established in
previous interim strategies, which emphasized the need to promote growth via targeted attention to
macro-stability, infrastructure development (especially energy), an improved business environment, better
governance and investments in agriculture and human capital. The second objective was less prominent in
previous strategies. It is being given higher priority now because of wider recognition that
environmentally-sensitive use of Kosovo’s major natural resources—including investments in energy
efficiency and renewables, as well as better management/clean-up of environmental hazards—are critical
elements of the effort to improve the population’s health and living standards.
v.
Support for Kosovo under this CPS is organized into two pillars corresponding to the two
main objectives given above. Pillar I aims at accelerating broad-based and sustained growth through
actions in six main areas: (i) supporting infrastructure, particularly energy, (ii) improving the business
climate, supporting the private sector, and increasing access to finance; (iii) supporting agriculture
development; (iv) continuing to invest in education and skills; (v) strengthening the regulatory and
institutional frameworks for labor and social protection; and (vi) reinforcing public financial management
and anti-corruption efforts. Pillar II seeks to support the Government to increase energy efficiency and the
use of renewables, reduce environmental hazards, enhance water supply, and move towards
harmonization with EU environmental standards.
vi.
It is expected that IDA funding for the CPS would be around SDR 48.1 million, i.e., about
US$76 million or US$19 million annually, supplemented by about US$66 million in grant funds

i

channeled through IDA by donors. In addition, IFC will aim to provide around US$40–50 million
in the form of direct financing to the private sector as well as additional funds for advisory services.
MIGA could provide political risk guarantees in support of the energy sector. The CPS envisages five
new IDA operations, a grant-financed DPL operation and IFC and MIGA transactions.
vii.
A main focus of the new lending under the CPS program is the energy sector with the aim
of addressing Kosovo’s energy crisis in a comprehensive way, taking full account of environmental
considerations and mitigating adverse impacts. Proposed support would comprise a Partial Risk
Guarantee (FY13/FY14) to private investors bidding on construction of a new (replacement) coal-fired
power plant, where IFC would also consider to contribute with its own financing and through
mobilization of additional funds, as well as transaction advice from IFC for privatization of electricity
distribution. To support construction of the power plant, MIGA would consider providing an investment
guarantee against non-commercial risks. A large Energy Efficiency and Renewables project (FY13) under
CPS Pillar II would also help to implement the country’s energy strategy. In addition, a small additional
financing operation for the ongoing Energy Sector Clean up and Land Reclamation project would help
build Government’s environmental and social impact monitoring capacity, as well as carry out additional
clean up of the legacy waste at the site of Kosovo’s existing thermal power plants. The program also
includes three other operations, including the second in a two-part program of grant-funded DPL
operations for Sustainable Employment (FY12), an Education Improvement project (FY14) and a Water
Supply project (FY15).
viii.
While new lending will be selective, the WBG will continue to support a broader
development agenda through a robust program of AAA and technical assistance/capacity building.
In addition to annual analysis and monitoring of the macro-fiscal framework, financial sector, poverty and
gender, and ongoing IFC advisory support for the investment climate and PPPs in infrastructure, the CPS
includes a Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) and three ROSCs, a Country Environmental Analysis and
programmatic assistance to strengthen public expenditure management, the fiduciary framework and anticorruption efforts. In addition, Kosovo benefits from AAA activities covering the Western Balkans,
including analytical work on Smart Safety Nets, Energy Strategy, Employment and Jobs, Health Finance
and Climate Change, as well as several Trust Funds financed by the EC, in areas such as Science,
Technology and Innovation, Monitoring and Evaluation and Public Financial Management.



The implementation of the FY12-15 CPS entails four main risks as follows:
Kosovo’s uneven track record in fiscal management in the past raises some questions about
medium-term macroeconomic stability, especially if further economic deterioration occurs in
Europe. Recent improvements in fiscal management and the new Stand-By Arrangement
(covering a 20 month period from April 2012) with the IMF should help to reduce this risk.
While investment in Kosovo’s energy sector is critical to growth, job creation, and poverty
reduction, the Bank’s involvement in the new lignite-fuelled power generation plant will likely
generate controversy among some civil society groups. This risk is being addressed through
ensuring transparent processes and regular dialogue/outreach throughout project development.
An additional risk is that, given continued turmoil in financial markets (especially in Europe),
power project financing may not be easy to obtain. The availability of WBG guarantees should
help to mitigate this risk. Credit enhancement from other multilateral lenders would also help to
catalyze needed funds from the private sector.
Kosovo’s governance and political structures could destabilize in the event of significant shocks.
Also, Kosovo’s governance systems still lack full transparency, accountability, and viability.
Actions to support improved public financial management included in the DPL and in the
ongoing Public Sector Management Project should help to reduce this risk. The Bank will also
carry out programmatic AAA to follow on the recommendations of the Country Fiduciary
Assessment, including support for anti-corruption initiatives.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) is the first to be prepared since Kosovo declared
independence in February 2008 and became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank Group (WBG) in mid-2009. The CPS, which covers FY12–15, follows a series of
Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs) implemented over the last decade—the most recent one being a two-year
ISN for FY10–11. This CPS is being prepared after Kosovo’s 2011 general election to ensure close
alignment with the Government’s national development priorities in the context of the country’s
aspirations for integration with the European Union (EU). As Kosovo is an IDA-only country, the
strategy will be financed principally by an allocation from IDA-16 for FY12–14 and from IDA-17 for
FY15. At this stage, it is expected that the total funds available for Kosovo for the CPS period would be
around SDR 48.1 million (or about US$76 million), i.e., about US$19 million annually. It should be
noted, however, that in accordance with IDA rules, all the amounts beyond FY12 are indicative only.
Actual allocations will depend on (i) the country’s own performance; (ii) its performance relative to that
of other IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list of
active IDA-eligible countries; (v) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the
amount of compensatory resources received for Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Since IDA
allocations are made in SDRs, the US dollar equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will provide about US$40–50 million in the form of direct
financing to the private sector as well as additional funds for advisory services. To support private sector
participation in the power sector, MIGA would consider providing an investment guarantee against noncommercial risks and IFC would consider providing financing for its own account as well as mobilize
additional funding from other financial institutions. In addition, substantial grant resources—about US$66
million—will complement WBG funds in financing the CPS program.
2.
The FY12–15 CPS proposes a selective and targeted support program aimed at (i)
promoting growth and employment, and (ii) improving environmental management. Building on the
direction set by the FY10–11 ISN, the CPS consolidates the shift in the Bank’s focus from post-conflict
reconstruction support towards a clear emphasis on addressing medium-term development challenges.
The strategy pays due attention to lessons learned from the WBG’s involvement in Kosovo in the decade
since the end of the 1998–99 conflict, the execution of ongoing Government or donor-sponsored
programs, and consultations with the Government of Kosovo, Parliament, the private sector, civil society,
and the community of bilateral and multilateral development partners.
3.
The main objectives of the CPS are to support Kosovo to (i) accelerate broad-based
economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) improve environmental management. The
proposed strategic focus of this CPS stems from the Government’s own policy priorities anchored in the
need to build a stable society following years of conflict, and the objective of preparing the country for
eventual EU membership. The CPS is fully aligned with the Government’s national development plan and
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2011–14. Fostering employment-generating,
inclusive growth is critical for a young, multiethnic country with high unemployment and, as such, could
help to reduce the strains that exist within the society from years of ethnic conflicts. In parallel, there is a
need to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewables, strengthen environmental management, and
improve access to good quality water.

II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Context
4.
Kosovo is a potential candidate for EU membership, now with a clear perspective in the
Stabilization and Association Process (SAP). The February 2012 agreements in the EU-moderated talks
with Serbia on Kosovo’s regional representation1 and integrated border management (the ―footnote
compromise‖) appears to have enabled the European Commission (EC) to establish contractual relations2
and, on that basis, (i) take the first steps in the SAP, starting with the feasibility study; and (ii) advance
membership in European (financial) institutions. As per assurance contained in the EC’s October 2011
Enlargement Package, the EU has opened the visa liberalization dialogue in January 2012, with the aim
of enabling visa-free travel to the Schengen area in due course. The EC has reiterated its commitment to
full EU membership ―once conditions are met.‖ Progress towards integration is monitored regularly via
annual Progress Reports. The EC’s 2011 Progress Report called for considerable reforms and investments
to enable Kosovo to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU.
5.
The period of ―supervised independence‖ ends in December 2012. In early 2012, the 25country International Steering Group (ISG), set up in 2008 to guide democratic development, promote
good governance, multi-ethnicity, and the rule of law, announced its plans—with subsequent support
from Parliament—to close the International Civilian Office (ICO), thus far the final authority regarding
the interpretation of the Comprehensive Settlement Proposal (―Ahtisaari Plan‖).3 The appointment of the
new head of the EU Office in early 2012 marked the end of the personal union between the EU Special
Representative (EUSR) and the International Civilian Representative (ICR), in preparation of the latter
position’s abolishment. However, both the EU’s rule-of-law mission (EULEX), which performs some
police, judicial, and customs functions, and the NATO-led peacekeeping force (KFOR), with more than
6,000 soldiers from 30 countries, are expected to continue to play important—if gradually declining—
roles in the foreseeable future. KFOR’s main objectives are to (i) provide a safe and secure environment;
(ii) maintain security in northern Kosovo; and (iii) oversee the newly established Kosovo Security Force.
6.
Although there has been a steady increase in international recognition of Kosovo, the
country is not yet a member of the United Nations, in turn hindering Kosovo’s overarching
objectives of political integration and socio-economic development. As of March 20, 2012, 89
countries have recognized Kosovo’s independence, including all neighbors except Serbia (which regards
Kosovo as a UN-governed entity within its sovereign territory). The prospect for UN membership4
remains dim as two veto-holding permanent members of the UN Security Council have called for the
statehood issue to be settled in direct negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade. Following the violent
escalation of the trade tit-for-tat over the recognition of Kosovo’s customs stamps in 2011-S2, the status
of northern Kosovo—comprising three Serb-majority municipalities and the city of Mitrovica that have
refused to accept the authority of the central authorities in Pristina—has been placed on the political
agenda, albeit without a clear perspective of a political settlement.
1

With this agreement, Kosovo will represent and sign for itself in regional fora and not require any longer the representation
through UNMIK. However, it does so not under its Constitutional name (―Republic of Kosovo‖) but as ―Kosovo*‖ with a
footnote stating, ―This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion
on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.‖
2
The ―footnote compromise‖ appears to have unblocked obstacles in the formal progress in advancing the integration agenda that
has been constrained by the non-recognition of Kosovo by five EU members.
3
In April 2008, UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari had presented to the UN Security Council a ―Comprehensive Proposal for
the Kosovo Status Settlement‖ with a recommendation of eventual independence, following a period of international supervision.
4
For a ―peace-loving State‖ to become a member of the UN, it would have to (i) garner the recommendation from 9 of the 15
members of the Security Council (without any of the five permanent members vetoing such a decision); and (ii) secure a twothird majority of currently 193 member states.

2

7.
Kosovo’s political system is a representative democracy with a unicameral legislature. The
Parliament of Kosovo has 120 members, of which 10 are reserved for ethnic Serbs and another 10 for
other minority parties. Electoral laws also require that at least every third candidate on the electoral lists
of all parties is female. There are currently five major political parties represented in Parliament and
twelve smaller ones representing ethnic minorities. The largest parties include the center-left Democratic
Party of Kosovo (PDK), the center-right Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), the nationalist youth
movement Self-Determination (Vetëvendosja), and the center-right Alliance for the Future of Kosovo
(AAK). The Government coalition is formed between the PDK and two other political parties represented
in Parliament, viz., the pro-business New Kosovo Alliance (AKR) and the Serb-minority Independent
Liberal Party (SLS). Following two presidential crises in 2010 and 2011 and a subsequent compromise
across all major parties, President Atifete Jahjaga—Kosovo’s first female, first non-partisan president—is
expected to be the last head of state elected indirectly by Parliament. Two commissions are currently
finalizing a broad-based overhaul of the Constitution and the Electoral Law to allow, inter alia, for the
direct election of the President. On this basis, the next rounds of presidential and general elections are
foreseen in 2013.
B.

Recent Macroeconomic Developments

8.
Kosovo’s economic growth has averaged over 4 percent since the end of the conflict in 1999,
and remained positive throughout the global economic crisis. Growth peaked at 6.9 percent in 2008
before declining to 3 percent in 2009 in the wake of the crisis (see Table 1). The overall impact of the
crisis was smaller in Kosovo than in neighboring countries, largely because of Kosovo’s limited
integration into the global economy. Growth is estimated to have reached around 4 percent in 2010 and 5
percent in 2011, with preliminary data suggesting that growth was driven by increased public spending,
and, to a lesser extent, by private investment and a surge in commodity exports. The IMF projects that
GDP growth will be around 3–4 percent in the medium-term, because Kosovo is somewhat insulated
from the global economy. However, a sharper-than-expected downturn in Europe would lower growth
through declines in exports and remittances.
9.
Having adopted the euro as the local currency, Kosovo has to rely on fiscal policy as the
main anchor for macroeconomic stability. However, Kosovo’s fiscal position has become strained as
expenditures have risen rapidly since 2008. The savings from fiscal surpluses accumulated up until 2007,
reflecting conservative spending policy and over-performing revenues, began to erode in 2008 and the
fiscal deficit widened in successive years. The Government concluded an 18-month, €104-million StandBy Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in July 2010. However, the program went off-track, largely due to
the failure of an attempt to privatize the telecommunications company (PTK) and an (unplanned) increase
of 27 percent in civil servant wages to fulfill an electoral campaign promise. In July 2011, the authorities
and the IMF agreed on a six-month staff-monitored program (SMP). Although the non-realization of
revenues from the sale of PTK could have been covered by existing accumulated bank balances, the
Government, in agreement with the IMF, decided instead to make cuts of about €60 million to the budget
to preserve a higher level of bank balances.
10.
Since July 2011, macroeconomic policies have been broadly satisfactory and the
implementation of structural measures under the SMP has remained on track leading to the
agreement on a new IMF SBA. The two SMP reviews were successfully concluded with fiscal targets
met; the 2011 budget deficit (1.8 percent of GDP) was 1 percentage point lower than projected. The
process of privatizing PTK (originally expected to be completed in 2011 and part of the SMP) is ongoing
in 2012 and the financial transaction is expected to close in 2013. due to waning investors’ interest,
which, in turn, put pressure on the Government’s ability to finance the deficit. In this context, the

3

Government cut expenditure by about €60 million in the 2011 budget and adopted a more restrained
budget for 2012. In terms of structural measures, solid reform progress was achieved on tax
administration, banking, and energy reforms. As a result of the successful implementation of the SMP, the
authorities and the IMF reached agreement on a 20-month, €107-million SBA, starting in April 2012.

The authorities are committed to maintaining medium-term fiscal sustainability. The fiscal
deficit is expected to increase to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2012 and to peak at 3.3 percent of GDP in 2013,
due to high spending on the Route 7 motorway. It is then projected to decline in 2014 when the motorway
project is planned to be completed. At the same time, improvements in tax administration are expected to
improve tax collection and tax revenue over the medium-term. The commitment to a sustainable medium-

4

term fiscal framework was supported by actions taken by the authorities in the second half of 2011. First,
the construction of the Route 6 motorway to FYR Macedonia will start only after a cost-benefit analysis is
carried out and financing secured. Second, additional war-related benefits, defined by the law on war
values of December 2011, will be introduced based on a fiscal impact assessment and consider
affordability and economic incentives criteria. This implies that the authorities would first define the
amount of spending and only then define the benefits, so that spending limits are not breached.
12.
Kosovo’s public debt—at 5.6 percent of GDP at end-2011—is very low and largely
comprised of the inherited share of ex-Yugoslav debt to IBRD.5 There are two legal mechanisms to
preclude public debt from rising to unsustainable levels. First, Kosovo’s public debt law sets a maximum
public debt ratio of 40 percent of GDP and, second, the Constitution requires that any external borrowing
by the Government requires Parliamentary ratification with a two-thirds majority. The public debt stock
was entirely external until 2011, as the Government securities market had not yet been developed. As of
January 2012, the Ministry of Finance has successfully issued the first rounds of 3-month T-bills, in the
amount of €10 million each, with preparations being made for 6-month T-bills later on in 2012.
Commercial banks, which have good liquidity (including non-interest earning excess reserves at the
CBK) are expected to be the main investors in the domestic securities market. While data on private
external borrowing is not fully available, such borrowing is likely to be very small (below 1 percent of
GDP), given Kosovo firms’ very limited access to international financial markets. Therefore, total
external debt, though not officially published, is estimated to be only slightly higher than the public debt.
13.
Despite its low external and public debt, Kosovo’s debt sustainability could be jeopardized
by worsening fiscal deficits or growth moderation. The IMF’s debt sustainability analysis in the 2011
Article IV report shows that all debt indicators remain on a sustainable path over the next two decades in
the baseline fiscal and external scenarios shown in Table 1 (Annex 2). However, the debt trajectory is
subject to prominent risks that could derive either from fiscal issues and/or growth shocks. Maintaining
the primary deficit as a share of GDP at the 2011 budgeted level of 4.8 percent of GDP over a two decade
period would put debt on an unsustainable path. Debt would also become unsustainable if growth is lower
by one standard deviation (2.3 percentage points) in 2012 and 2013. In terms of external debt, the main
weakness lies with the high debt and debt service to exports ratios. This is a result of Kosovo’s small
export base, a weakness which is somewhat rectified by Kosovo’s large and stable remittance flows.6
14.
With limited room to maneuver in monetary policy, maintaining macroeconomic stability
must rely on sound fiscal policy. On the revenue side, the main priorities for policymakers are to
broaden the tax base and continue to improve revenue collection. Making fiscal spending more efficient
and sustainable will depend on the timely implementation of structural reforms in key sectors, including
energy, transport, and health. In addition, maintaining control over recurrent expenditures—in particular,
salaries and social transfers—will be essential for fiscal sustainability. Given Kosovo’s unilateral
euroization, monetary policy is constrained, and ensuring stability of the banking sector will remain a
priority especially in the prevailing environment of uncertainty in European financial markets. Setting up
the ―emergency liquidity assistance‖ fund for the banking sector represents an important step.
C.

Socio-Economic Environment

15.
Although Kosovo has come a long way in re-establishing peace and social stability, a few
municipalities with sizeable minority populations—mainly those in the Serb-dominated
5

Up to 2009, Kosovo had no public debt. In 2009, Kosovo took over its share of former Yugoslavia’s debt to IBRD, in the
amount of €381 million (9.7 percent of GDP). Kosovo has not participated in the division of other assets and liabilities of former
Yugoslavia; if this process takes place, it may inherit additional debt owed to the Paris and London Clubs.

The IMF’s debt sustainability analysis includes the potential additional liabilities referred to in footnote 5.

5

municipalities in northern Kosovo—continue to experience unrest. While considerable progress has
been made in overcoming the tensions in mixed areas, the three Serb-dominated municipalities in
northern Kosovo remain prone to localized outbreaks of violence. Other minorities tend to keep a low
profile in terms of ethnic conflict but sometimes suffer economic and social discrimination, and are
disproportionately represented among Kosovo’s poorest households. The Government of Kosovo and
civil society groups have put in place a number of initiatives to promote inclusion of all minorities
including through affirmative action.
16.
With a per-capita GDP of about €2,600, Kosovo is one of the poorest countries in Europe.
With 34.5 percent of its population of 1.8 million7 living below the poverty line, i.e., on less than €1.55
per day (and about 12 percent living on less than €1 per day), poverty is widespread. However, Kosovo
has a relatively low Gini index (about 0.3 in 2009) and a relatively flat consumption distribution. No
significant differences exist between urban and rural poverty, but there are notable regional differences,
with poverty rates varying from 53.8 percent to 18 percent among districts. Young people are
disproportionately poor, accounting for about 60 percent of people living below the poverty line.
Kosovo’s ethnic minorities—especially the Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian ethnic groups, which comprise
about 2–3 percent of the population—are particularly vulnerable to income poverty besides frequently
being marginalized in socio-political and economic life. As in many other countries, there is a strong
negative correlation between education and poverty, with those having secondary or higher education
much less likely to be poor.
17.
Widespread unemployment and a lack of quality jobs have contributed significantly to
poverty and income insecurity as well as to gender inequality, social instability, and ethnic tensions.
With a 45-percent unemployment rate and a low employment rate (29 percent), Kosovo has the weakest
employment track record in Europe. Kosovo’s 53 percent labor participation rate among the working-age
population is substantially below the ECA average (65 percent). Obviously, the lack of jobs has direct
consequences on income, and empirical evidence suggests that the risk of poverty is 20 percent higher for
the unemployed than the employed. Households with unemployed heads have the highest extreme poverty
indices. In addition, many households with adult members in precarious or unsteady jobs are also below
the poverty line. Many of these households are dependent on small, informal enterprises for the majority
of their income, reflecting the high degree of informality in Kosovo’s economy.
18.
Kosovo’s difficult labor market conditions have been especially severe for youth and
women. Unemployment among the population 15–25-year-olds reaches 76 percent—a figure that is more
alarming considering that 21 percent of Kosovo’s population is between the ages of 15 and 25. The poor
quality of the education system, coupled with limited employment opportunities, makes it difficult for
young people to access and retain jobs. Moreover, young people who do find employment are typically
hired into low-skilled, low-productivity positions, often in the informal sector. According to survey data,
about 20 percent of employed youth did not have an employment contract, 37 percent were not entitled to
paid leave, and 73 percent were not registered in the social security system. At 56 percent, unemployment
is also unacceptably high among Kosovo’s women. Only 11 percent of working age women are
employed, compared with 68 percent of men, in part because of lower educational opportunities and
achievement (see Box 1).

7

According to the data from the 2011 census, Kosovo’s resident population stands at about 1.73 million, excluding the
population in northern Kosovo. The World Bank thus estimates the entire population at close to 1.8 million.

Box 1: Gender Disparity in Kosovo
Kosovo has made progress in tackling gender inequalities over time, but substantial gender gaps persist. Focusing on
gender inequalities in human capital and economic opportunities, a gender diagnostic, undertaken to inform the
CPS, identified significant disparities: (i) large gender gaps in literacy, educational attainment and secondary school
enrollment; (ii) overall low life expectancy, more pronounced for women, and high maternal mortality (iii)
exceptionally low women’s labor force participation and employment rates; and (iv) low representation of women in
entrepreneurship and management, as well as in senior Government positions.
Gender gaps in human capital. Kosovo has achieved near universal primary school enrollment and the country has
made significant progress in improving literacy rates. However, significant gender gaps persist. Women are more
than twice as likely as men to be illiterate, with illiteracy rates of 7.2 percent for females, compared to 2.2 for males.
However, some progress has been made in recent years, given that the gender gap widens with age (in rural areas,
the literacy gender gap reaches 34 percentage points among the elderly in rural areas. Women have lower
educational attainment than men in Kosovo and recent figures show that girls are underrepresented in educational
institutions at all levels—except for university education. In terms of enrollment, large gender gaps appear in
secondary level, with fewer girls enrolled than boys. Drop-out rates for girls in primary education are relatively
higher and, while boys’ drop-out rates have decreased since 2004, they have increased for girls.
Maternal mortality is estimated at 43.3 per 100,000 births, which is one of the highest rates in the ECA region.
Inadequate quality of antenatal care, pregnancy and labor complications, and unsafe abortions are among leading
causes of maternal deaths. Poor nutrition and anemia are also important contributing factors. Life expectancy has
increased slightly in Kosovo in the past decades for both men and women. Nevertheless, life expectancy for both
groups is the lowest of the Western Balkans countries (71.8 and 67.6 years for women and men, respectively) and
women’s advantage in life expectancy is smaller than that seen in global averages, mainly due to lower life
expectancy for women. Other important gender-related concerns in Kosovo are the high rate of miscarriages,
stillbirths and abortions, and evidence of a sex imbalance at birth in favor of boys.
Gender gaps in economic opportunities. Labor market outcomes in Kosovo are among the poorest in the region,
particularly for women. Women’s labor force participation is significantly lower than for men (26 percent compared
to 58 percent in 2009, respectively) and has decreased since 2002. This low activity rate for women, the lowest in
the Western Balkans, is partly related to a disproportionate share of household responsibilities or because they are
discouraged by the absence of opportunities for paid employment outside the home. Other closely related factors are
the lack of childcare facilities and an inadequate access to flexible work arrangements. In addition, unemployment
rates are significantly higher for females (56 percent) than for males (41 percent) in Kosovo, and are the highest, for
both sexes, of countries in the region. Unemployment rates reach very high levels for the younger population (15–24
years), at 82 percent for women and 69 percent for men. Among the low share of employed women, they are
considerably underrepresented in leading positions in firms, comprising less than ten percent of all entrepreneurs
and with the lowest representation in private firms’ top management (0.3 percent) of all ECA countries. Finally,
although Kosovo has made significant progress in increasing women’s voice in political decision-making, the share
of women in leading Government positions remains low.

19.
Besides facing challenges of widespread income poverty, Kosovo’s citizens have insufficient
opportunity for investment in education and health as evidenced by relatively low social indicators.
While Kosovo’s net primary enrollment rate reaches 96 percent, the country’s secondary and higher
education enrollment lags behind rates in South East Europe (SEE). For example, Kosovo’s 75 percent
net secondary enrollment rate trails the 82 percent rate in neighboring FYR Macedonia, and drop-out rates
remain high in rural areas, especially among girls. The gender gap in secondary enrollments has not yet
narrowed tangibly, with women in their twenties being much less likely than men to have completed
secondary education (60 percent versus 76 percent). Moreover, Kosovo’s education system does not
provide to its nearly one-half million students adequate curricula and instruction to produce the skills that
the evolving labor market requires. The National Qualification Authority recently adopted a new National
Qualification Framework (NQF) which aims to strengthen standards in pre-university and
vocational/technical education. Health outcomes in Kosovo are extremely low. According to UNDP data,
Kosovo had the highest child and infant mortality rates and the lowest life expectancy (70 years in 2009)

7

in SEE. Major investments in the quality of basic healthcare services are needed to improve outcomes in
tuberculosis, immunization, and reproductive care. Access to health care also faces significant barriers.
Within Europe, Kosovo has the lowest rate for hospital admissions and the second lowest rate for
outpatient visits. Shortages of essential drugs are widespread, and out-of-pocket payments constitute 80
percent of the expenditures on pharmaceuticals.
III.

KEY DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

20.
The central development challenge relates to an economic growth path that (i) creates highquality jobs; and (ii) uses key natural resources in a sustainable and environmentally sensitive
manner. Kosovo’s growth model in recent years has largely been based on the availability of external
sources of financing, especially donor assistance and remittances. The Government of Kosovo recognizes
that this model cannot be the foundation of a sustainable growth strategy, especially in the current
economic environment. Donor support has already declined considerably from its peak and is expected to
decline even further. By contrast, private-sector investment has begun to emerge and could be the
principal engine for accelerated growth and employment-creation. Creating a hospitable climate for
investment is thus a critical component of Government’s current strategy -- Vision of Economic
Development Priorities and associated Action Plan and Medium-term Expenditure Framework (20112014) -- for creating jobs for the large proportion of unemployed Kosovars, and accelerating the
convergence to SEE and European income levels. In addition, Government attaches high priority to
agriculture sector development as the sector currently accounts for 35 percent of total employment.
Kosovo is also increasingly aware of the need to pay more attention to environmental problems and to
move towards EU environmental standards and requirements. The remainder of this section provides a
more in-depth look at the challenges faced by Kosovo in each of these areas.
A.

Key Challenges in Promoting Private Investment and Employment

21.
Kosovo has considerable potential to shift towards rapid and sustainable private sector-led
growth and job creation if it can address existing obstacles to investment. As noted in the Bank’s
2010 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the country enjoys several comparative advantages that
are important to the creation of a flourishing export sector as well as to attracting local and foreign
investment in the tradable sectors. Indeed, Kosovo is endowed with several key assets, viz., abundant
natural resources, a young and growing (albeit underutilized) labor force, good quality agricultural land,
and virtually free access to the EU and regional markets. In some respects, the policy environment is also
favorable, including (i) a tax system that is simple and has low rates; (ii) a labor market that is more
flexible than in neighboring countries; and (iii) comparatively low wages for (semi-)skilled workers.
Nonetheless, there are a number of serious obstacles to investment that need to be addressed if Kosovo is
to realize its potential as an attractive destination for local and foreign private investment.
22.
The 2010 BEEPS8 report for Kosovo points to five sets of obstacles to doing business. While
in some areas the business climate in Kosovo is better than that in neighboring countries (or even in the
EU10+1), main challenges include severe infrastructure gaps, deficiencies in the rule of law, shortages of
appropriately skilled labor, limited access to finance, and onerous regulatory procedures for business
entry and operations. Challenges and the Government’s strategies in each of these areas are described
below.

Infrastructure
23.
Surveys of private firms (BEEPS 2010) indicate that infrastructure problems are perhaps
the most serious constraint faced by businesses in Kosovo—with power, transport, and
telecommunication cited most frequently. Over 98 percent of Kosovo firms surveyed by BEEPS cited
unreliable electricity supply as a major obstacle to day-to-day operations and a constraint both to
investment in new equipment and business expansion, in turn affecting job and employment creation.
Frequent power outages both increase costs by necessitating the use of expensive and polluting dieselfired power generation and prevent investment in sophisticated equipment. Moreover, the power sector is
currently both a major drain on public funds—absorbing €70 million in public subsidies annually—and
highly polluting. To address these critical issues, Government—working in close concert with the EC,
USAID, and the World Bank Group—has developed a multi-pronged approach aimed at ensuring
adequate and reliable energy supplies, reducing the need for public subsidies to energy, and limiting the
negative environmental impacts of power generation. The strategy also aims at significantly enhancing
the involvement of the private sector in generation and distribution, while strengthening Government’s
regulatory and supervisory capacity. The implementation of the strategy will depend on continued support
from Kosovo’s external development partners as well as interest from private energy firms, which could
be an issue in the current uncertain global economic climate. More details concerning the energy situation
and Government’s strategy are given in Box 2 below.
24.
Kosovo’s transport system is also inadequate in relation to business and trade needs and is
incompatible with European standards in many respects. Adequate road transport and its integration
with the networks of neighboring countries are of critical importance, given Kosovo’s landlocked
geographical position. Currently, the costs of goods transported between Kosovo and key trading partners
are among the highest in the region and a major deterrent to the achievement of greater trade integration
and the development of export-oriented businesses. In this context, Government has embarked on major
road investments, notably construction of a €660-million highway to Albania (providing businesses with
sea access and a route to Western Europe) which is now under way, and has plans for another major
highway to FYR Macedonia. Within Kosovo the road network density (3.3 km per 1,000 people) lags
behind the ECA average (8.6 km per 1,000 people) and quality is poor due to poor construction and
inadequate maintenance.

placed Kosovo below the Europe and Central
Asia averages for Government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption. The Global
Integrity Index rated Kosovo as ―very weak‖ on Government accountability, administration, and civil
service. Weak administration manifests itself directly in poor service delivery. A 2010 Life in Transition
(LIT) Survey ranked Kosovo lower than the SEE average on satisfaction with public services ranging
from social services to police and the courts. The Government has initiated many reforms and enacted
some laws, but implementation is slow. The Government’s revised public administration strategy for the
period 2010–13, adopted in September 2010, has not yet been implemented. In civil service reform, some

Box 2: Energy in Kosovo
Demand for energy has been growing rapidly in Kosovo over the past decade, with actual energy
consumption and peak demand growing by more than 90 percent between 2000 and 2010—despite being
constrained by supply limitations and consequent frequent load shedding. As seen in many countries, these problems
have multiple adverse impacts. First, prolonged electricity load shedding (power cuts) deprives people of light,
space heating, refrigeration, and cooking fuel—with obvious implications for their health, access to education, and
overall quality of life. Second, there is convincing evidence that Kosovo’s unreliable power supply is a major
constraint to business development and, hence, badly-needed employment opportunities. As the population grows,
demand for electricity is continuing to climb by about 4.6 percent a year.
Most of Kosovo’s domestic electricity generation comes from two coal-fired power plants (Kosovo A and B)
with net operating capacity of about 840–900 MW. Additional supply, amounting to 5–17 percent of annual
consumption over the past decade, is derived largely from imports of electricity via regional interconnections. The
availability of electricity imports for base power is unreliable and subject to price volatility because it is affected by
supply conditions in neighboring exporting countries (e.g., hydrological conditions in the region). A KfW funded
400kV transmission line between Kosovo and Albania should help to facilitate an exchange of power, given that
Albania relies principally on hydroelectric generation while Kosovo has predominantly thermal power. This power
exchange should result in operational, economic, and environmental benefits to both countries. In general, however
the regional market is shallow. Moreover imported power is also frequently generated from thermal sources. With
regard to generation as well, the current situation is unsatisfactory: both thermal power plants are antiquated and
unreliable and operating well below their installed capacity. For example, two of five units at Kosovo A, the oldest
and largest plant, are out of operation and the remaining three produce only up to about 350 MW, well below their
installed capacity. The Kosovo B plant (net capacity of about 540 MW), though newer (about 25 years old), is
affected by damage to the turbine rotors of its two units and deterioration of other critical components, resulting in
frequent forced outages. Both plants are highly polluting, with Kosovo A being the worst single-point source of
pollution in SEE. Its high emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (PM) have significant
negative health impacts for the population in the vicinity of the plants, which includes the capital city Pristina.
In this context, Government, with support from several external partners, has proposed a multi-pronged
approach to addressing Kosovo’s energy crisis and related environmental issues. It seeks to (i) close Kosovo A
by 2017 and replace it with a new, state-of-the-art, privately operated 600-MW power plant termed the ―Kosova e
Re‖ Power Plant (KRPP); (ii) attract private investment to rehabilitate and upgrade Kosovo B, including ensuring
conformity with EU environmental standards; (iii) privatize electricity distribution inter alia to reduce technical and
commercial losses; (iv) step up payment enforcement and raise tariffs to levels consistent with full cost recovery; (v)
expeditiously address environmental legacy issues associated with Kosovo A and B; (vi) invest significantly greater
resources in energy efficiency in the near term; and (vii) maximize the use of renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind,
geothermal). Implementation of the above strategy is expected to reduce PM emissions by over 90 percent, sulfur
and nitrogen oxides by over 70 percent and lower carbon emissions per unit of electricity produced.
Several studies of Kosovo’s energy options have been conducted with donor assistance over the last ten years.
A 2004 Regional Generation Investment Study for the Western Balkans and its 2007 Update indicated an emerging
shortage of 10,000 -12,000 MW by 2025. More recently, the Bank conducted a study entitled Development and
Evaluation of Power Supply Options for Kosovo (2011), whose findings broadly support the strategy being
proposed by the Kosovo Government. The Options Study considered ways of meeting Kosovo’s current and future
energy needs taking into account economic, financial, and environmental costs, including the potential contributions
of efficiency improvements, demand-side management, construction of small hydropower plants, and other
renewable sources, importing electricity from neighboring countries and additional thermal generation. The study
found that the lowest-cost reliable energy supply that would meet Kosovo’s base load and peak demand is a mix of
thermal and renewable energy sources. This mix would include (i) a hydropower plant (Zhur) of about 300-MW
and, according to a DANIDA study, at least 60 MW from small hydropower plants; (ii) a preliminary estimate of
395 MW in wind, biomass and biogas-fired power generation (to be confirmed through technical studies); (iii)
upgrading of Kosovo B plant; and (iv) construction of the new 600-MW coal power plant which has been proposed
by Government to replace Kosovo A. The study is premised on continued investment in energy efficiency
improvements, rapid reduction of technical and commercial losses and development of renewable energy sources. In
the longer term (10–15 years) it is expected that construction of a Balkans gas-ring could enable Kosovo to import
gas to meet its growing energy demand.

10

important regulations and administrative instructions have been adopted, such as the regulation on
working hours, on job descriptions, the appointment of senior civil servants, and the register of civil
servants. However, the legal framework necessary to implement the primary civil service legislation has
not been adopted. Judicial reform has been initiated, but has not improved court efficiency or assured the
safety and independence of the judiciary yet. An anti-corruption agency has been established and some
legal reforms taken to strengthen the anti-corruption legal framework, but implementation remains a
challenge. Considerable support is being provided by the EU’s (―technical‖) Rule of Law Mission to
Kosovo (EULEX)—with around 3,200 staff (of which 1,950 international)—in helping Kosovo’s
Government to strengthen police, judiciary, and customs.
Education and Labor Markets
26.
Appropriately educated, skilled human resources are critical to private investment, growth,
and employment. The education system needs to improve quality and relevance throughout the system
and address access issues at secondary and post-secondary levels where students from the poorest
households and women/girls from all income quintiles are clearly underrepresented. Indeed, 45 percent of
businesses surveyed reported difficulties in recruiting skilled workers; in turn, more than 50 percent of
unemployed men cited lack of appropriate education and skills as a reason for their inability to find work.
Kosovo’s school infrastructure is dramatically insufficient: more than half of schools operate on double
shifts and about 5 percent on triple shifts. School and university management is weak, particularly with
respect to monitoring of enrollment, performance, and institutional finances. At the same time, the
education system remains poorly regulated, resulting in the low quality of services and weak linkages
with labor demand, including apprenticeships for youth. Importantly, and within the framework of
moving towards universal access to secondary education, targeted strategies are needed to increase girls’
and women’s access to secondary and post-secondary education and significantly raise enrollment.
Similarly, attention needs to be paid to means of raising secondary school enrollments for children from
the poorest households, of which only about two-thirds attend secondary school. The Government is
placing high priority on strengthening the education system and has prepared a multi-year strategy for
developing both general and higher education. The strategy, which addresses quality, implementation, and
management issues, should help to alleviate sector deficiencies.
27.
While Kosovo’s considerable labor market flexibility should be sustained and labor taxes
kept low to promote labor demand, active labor market programs need to be strengthened to
facilitate the transition to work. Employment rigidity is among the lowest in the region and labor taxes
are low. Kosovo faces the challenge of maintaining these favorable conditions in the face of pressures to
increase worker protection and social services. It has done so successfully, for example, by passing a
health insurance law that transforms the financing of health services without threatening the financial
sustainability of the health system or increasing labor taxes. At the same time, however, major efforts are
needed to improve the transition from welfare and long-term unemployment to work. Currently, more
than 63 percent of unemployed people remain without work for over a year. To help to address this issue,
the Government has introduced public works programs aimed at reducing joblessness in the short term
and providing beneficiaries with the work experience needed to maintain/improve their employability.
Employment services, however, remain ineffective, largely due to the inadequacy of information systems
and low local capacities. Government has recently begun addressing this gap. As a first, immediate step,
the Government has started to digitize the records system, which, in turn, will allow for better case
management. It has also initiated a comprehensive, functional review of the employment services.
Strengthening the Financial Sector and Improving Access to Finance
28.
Kosovo’s financial system has proven quite resilient to the global financial crisis, and its
regulatory and institutional framework has been substantially strengthened. The financial system is

11

dominated by foreign-owned banks and is largely deposit-funded, mostly from large and relatively stable
remittance inflows. However, structural financial sector vulnerabilities exist as bank assets are highly
concentrated, leading to a lack of competition and high interest rates. As a result, Kosovo’s banking
system has one of the lowest loan-to-deposit ratios in the region. Additionally, banks rely excessively on
Government deposits. In recent years, Kosovo’s regulatory and supervisory framework has been
gradually improved to meet EU standards, both for banks and non-bank financial institutions. A new
Banking Law has been drafted that is expected to strengthen governance standards, limit related party
lending, authorize consolidated supervision of banking groups, and support bank resolution, when
needed. The new Banking Law also assigns the CBK responsibility for licensing of micro-finance
institutions.
29.
In addition to strengthening financial system supervision, there is a need to improve access
to affordable financial services, especially outside the capital city and for small enterprises. BEEPS
results indicate that access to credit is seen as a major obstacle by businesses in Kosovo. Only about 10
percent of investment is financed by credit, and over 85 percent of investment is financed from own
resources. Further strengthening of banks’ risk management practices is a necessary step in order to
increase banks’ willingness to lend. In addition, it is critical to develop and strengthen micro-finance
institutions that have the potential to lend to farmers and other rural entrepreneurs. This would involve,
inter alia, transforming existing non-profit foundations into more sustainable, for-profit financial
intermediaries and raising awareness of the potential roles of small entrepreneurs in mainstream economic
activities.
Legal and Institutional Framework for Business
30.
Although Kosovo’s business climate has a number of strengths, the acceleration of private
sector-led growth will involve addressing key institutional issues including ineffective licensing
regimes and weak property rights. Significant progress was made in Kosovo to put in place the basic
legal framework and institutional structures necessary for a market-oriented economy. Moreover,
Kosovo’s business climate has several features that could make the country attractive to investors vis-àvis its neighbors. Kosovo’s labor markets are very flexible, the trade regime is open and liberal, and the
banking sector is relatively dynamic, following the entry of foreign banks and gradually rising depositor
confidence. However, weak institutional capacity, unclear property rights, and a complicated and
fragmented licensing regime create fertile ground for growth of the grey economy. There is room for
streamlining red tape and the Government is moving forward with the establishment of a one-stop shop,
which should help potential investors to better navigate the requirements for investing in Kosovo.
31.
Improvement of the business environment is a key priority for Government and a Task
Force has been formed with the mandate of improving Kosovo’s DBR ranking (currently 117th
overall, see Figure 1). As a result of the task force’s efforts, Kosovo recently passed amendments to
relevant laws on business associations and internal trade to reduce the costs, number of steps and time
involved to start a business and eliminate work permits and the charter capital requirement for limited
liability companies.

Agriculture
32.
In addition to addressing the constraints present in the business environment that affect all
sectors of the economy, special attention should be paid to addressing issues in agriculture, given its
high potential. Kosovo—endowed with good quality agricultural land—had been largely food selfsufficient in the past. At present, the sector currently contributes about 12 percent to GDP and is the
largest employer in post-conflict Kosovo, accounting for approximately 35 percent of total employment.
With its relatively abundant and underutilized labor, Kosovo has competitive potential in the horticulture
sector, i.e., the production of fruits and vegetables as well as in the livestock sub-sector since domestic
demand for horticulture and livestock products is expected to grow as purchasing power increases. Over
the last decade, demand for high-value horticulture products has surged more than any other food
category. However, while there is great potential for growth and expansion of productivity in agriculture,
the sector faces several challenges that are reducing competitiveness and preventing it from meeting its
potential. Unfavorable farm structures, outdated farm technologies and farm management practices, suboptimal use of inputs, weak rural infrastructure, a rudimentary rural advisory system, and limited access
to credit and investment capital are all limiting factors. In addition, Kosovo’s farmers are placed at a
competitive disadvantage as agricultural imports originate in neighboring and EU member states in which
farmers receive production and export subsidies.
33.
The Government strategy to promote growth and competitiveness in the agriculture sector
is elaborated in the Agricultural and Rural Development Plan (ARDP) 2007–13 (which was updated
in 2009). The fundamental objectives are to (i) undertake actions to overcome the bottlenecks holding
back sustainable rural development in the country; and (ii) align Kosovo’s rural sector with the four axes
of the Instrument for Pre-Accession for Rural Development (IPARD). The Government is undertaking
several significant and strategic initiatives in this direction. It is also putting in place institutional
structures in line with EU accession requirements. It recently established the Paying Unit within the
Ministry which is expected to evolve into the IPARD Paying Agency.

Issues in Environmental Management

34.
Although environmental management has not been high on Government’s agenda in the
past, there is now growing recognition of the high costs of environmental neglect and the need to
move ahead more rapidly towards meeting EU standards and requirements in environment. The
Government’s Kosovo Environmental Action Plan (2011 draft) and the State of the Environment Report
as well as the Bank’s draft Country Environmental Assessment focus on three main areas problem
areas—viz., (i) air pollution; (ii) water availability and quality; and (iii) hazardous and municipal waste.
Key issues in each of these areas are discussed below, followed by a brief description of Government’s
strategy for addressing environmental problems in the country.
Air Pollution
35.
Air pollution is a significant problem in Kosovo’s urban areas and a moderate problem for
the country as a whole. Urban ambient air quality is poor particularly in Pristina, the Obiliq area, the
Drenas area, and in Mitrovica. The principal sources of pollution include (i) energy and mining
production activities and the burning of wood and lignite for household heating purposes; (ii) smoke and
emissions from large industrial complexes; (iii) landfills of urban and industrial waste which tend to have
more specific local impacts; and (iv) vehicular emissions. Key health impacts from air pollution are
related to the high levels of particulate matter (PM), also known as fine particles or dust. For the 2010–11
period, monthly average PM concentration values in Pristina fluctuated between 40–130 µg/m3—nearly
always above the 40 µg/m3 average concentration determined by the EU as being consistent with human
health. The key sources of PM emissions in Pristina are the power plant and household use of wood and
coal for heating purposes during winter. High PM levels are responsible for increases in cardiopulmonary
and lung cancer mortality in the case of long-term exposure as well as chronic bronchitis and respiratory
diseases, particularly in children.
Water Availability and Quality
36.
Kosovo has limited water resources, divided into four main water basins: the Drini i Bardh,
Ibri, Morava e Binçës, and Lepeneci. There is unequal water distribution throughout the country, and–
given the limited and insufficient water resources—water is expected to be a limiting factor for economic
and social development in the future, particularly given rising demand for water due to increases in urban,
industrial, and agricultural development. With regard to water quality, the percentage of the population
with access to piped water supply is just 70–75 percent, while an even smaller proportion (50–55 percent)
of the population is connected to the sewerage systems. Data from the Institute of Public Health on the
quality of drinking water show that the pollution of drinking water is generally associated with bacterial
rather than chemical contamination. Much of this bacterial (fecal) contamination occurs in the water
supply systems of small cities and rural areas where a large proportion of wells and springs are thought to
be contaminated, although no firm numbers exist. Given that there are no wastewater treatment plants in
operation in Kosovo, it is not surprising that water contamination is a major issue.
Untreated Hazardous and Municipal Waste
37.
Environmental impacts from former mining and mineral processing are a substantial
problem in Kosovo due to the lack of adequate environmental protection measures. Historical and
current industrial waste has remained—for long periods of time—in production sites, storage areas, and
industrial hot spots. Mining and industry activities generate about 1.3 million tons per year of waste
(commercial, hazardous and non-hazardous). Moreover, an estimated 395,000 tons of municipal solid
waste is generated yearly. At present, there is a near-total lack of proper waste management in Kosovo for
all waste types—domestic, industrial, healthcare, and hazardous waste—as well as for legacy pollution

14

from historical contamination. Current waste management practice, if left unchanged, will lead to high
levels of pollution of groundwater and air (e.g., through methane or landfill gas), but also dioxins and fine
particles when burned. In line with the municipal waste management policy, IFC has been working
towards the concessioning of the Pristina landfill, for which there is strong private sector investors’
interest.
Government Strategy for the Environment
38.
The Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP) is preparing an update of the
Kosovo Environmental Strategy (KES) and an associated National Environment Action Plan
(NEAP) for 2011–15, in close cooperation with other ministries, NGOs, and other development partners.
The NEAP identifies short and long term objectives in the environment area aimed at meeting EU
requirements. For the short term, the focus is on more rigorous implementation of existing legislation,
continued efforts to modify legislation and institutions to conform with EU requirements and integration
of environmental requirements into the sectoral development policies of relevant ministries. For the
longer term the KES/NEAP sets goals and/or strategies for the following four areas: (i) reduction in
pollution (including environmental degradation) and the prohibition of economic activities that harm
human health or the environment; (ii) bio-diversity protection and the preservation of ecological balance;
(iii) the rational and sustainable use of natural resources, including agricultural land; and (iv) the
protection of valuable natural landscapes. In addition, the NEAP identifies needed investments in water
and air quality, waste (including chemical waste) management, biodiversity preservation, and
environmental policy development, categorizing them by priority, cost, and likely sources of funding.

KOSOVO-WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP

Active Portfolio, Lessons Learned and Partnerships

39.
The last ISN for Kosovo, covering FY10-11, was the first to cover a period of over one year
and to involve the commitment of IDA credits as well as grants. Since Kosovo had not been a member
of the WBG until end-FY09, all World Bank–Kosovo operations prior to that time were financed through
grants from a variety of sources, principally the Bank’s net income, the Trust Fund for Kosovo, the PostConflict Fund, and IDA grants. Some of these projects are still active (though nearing completion) and are
included in the portfolio table shown below. Newer projects committed under the last ISN were financed
either partially or wholly through IDA credits.
40.
The World Bank supported portfolio currently consists of seven operations totaling
US$76.9 million in commitments and 11 trust funds totaling US$66 million, including two State and
Peace-Building Fund (SPF) grants. The Business Environment TA Project and four trust funds are
expected to close by June 2012. The remaining six operations and seven trust funds are either midway
through execution or just starting up and are expected to be in active status through most or all of the CPS
period (FY12–15). The objectives, content, and expected results of these operations have been reviewed
in discussions with the Government in the context of preparing this CPS to ensure that they are fully
consistent with the main objectives/directions of the FY12–15 strategy.

41.
For the three-year period from FY08-10, disbursements for Bank-supported projects
averaged close to 20 percent of total commitments per year but declined in FY11 to 13 percent, and
have remained slow in FY12. The decline in disbursements can be attributed, in part, to a slowdown in
implementation associated with the municipal and national elections that diverted the attention of key
officials. Disbursements were also affected by long effectiveness delays for some newly approved
operations. The Public Sector Management Project and the Real Estate and Cadastre Project—both
approved by the Board under the last ISN—were the first Bank operations in Kosovo to be financed
wholly or in part by credits rather than grants and, as such, were subject to approval by a two-thirds
majority in Parliament. Unfamiliarity with the processes for obtaining this approval and inadequate
consultation with opposition parliamentarians led to considerable delays in securing the approval needed
to make them effective. Eventually, both operations were approved by large parliamentary majorities
(well in excess of the two-thirds requirement).
42.
The Government of Kosovo and the Bank are working to strengthen portfolio
implementation. The capacity of implementing agencies is being strengthened through a series of
procurement and contract management training courses delivered quarterly to all employees and
consultants involved in World Bank financed projects. In addition, the Bank’s own capacity for
supervision support and provision of just-in-time training to Government staff has been strengthened
through the recruitment to the Country Office of a Country Operations Officer. Moreover, a Senior
Operations Officer, who is based in Skopje, is providing part-time support. Jointly with the Ministry of
Finance the World Bank team has started producing a Quarterly Portfolio Monitoring Tool, which
outlines the main implementation milestones for all operations, and lays out the principal tasks of
respective Government institutions and World Bank teams for the upcoming quarter. The Monitoring
Tool, which will serve as benchmark to monitor implementation of the program, has been developed in
close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and is shared with all Ministers benefiting from Bank
support.

43.
The CPS Kosovo program also benefits from substantial Trust Fund resources, currently
amounting to about US$66 million (Table 4). As the table shows, the trust funds are fully aligned with
the Bank’s country strategy, focusing in key areas such as employment, infrastructure, inclusion, and the
financial sector.

IFC’s committed portfolio for Kosovo comprises three investments totaling US$15.5 million
as well as focused advisory services in key sectors. Two of the IFC’s investments are allocated in the
financial sector to strengthen the capacity of a foreign bank to provide credit and financial services to
SMEs, while one is in the real sector to support a medium-sized manufacturing foreign company. IFC’s
advisory services will support public-private partnerships in the infrastructure sectors including the
privatization of the distribution arm of the public electricity company (KEK), and solid waste
management concession for Pristina municipality. Furthermore, through its Balkans Renewable Energy
Advisory Program (BREP), IFC will aim to improve the renewable energy regulatory framework, help
renewable energy sponsors to improve their project designs and business plans, and support financial
institutions to improve their internal capacities and knowledge on renewable energy. In addition, the
Trade Logistics Advisory Services program will provide assistance to improve administrative procedures
to simplify trade logistics, aiming to reduce the time and cost of trade and to increase exports. Also, IFC
plans to continue its corporate governance program and expand its regional Investment Climate Advisory
program to Kosovo. IFC will explore options to deepen its advisory work in the agribusiness sector in the
Western Balkans, including Kosovo.
45.
The current net exposure of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), as of
October 31, 2011, amounted to US$53.2 million. The MIGA exposure is the result of a guarantee that
MIGA issued in December of 2010 to ProCredit Holding (PCH) covering its investment in its subsidiary
in the Republic of Kosovo. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of expropriation
of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction. This project
is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued to PCH. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the

17

parent company of 21 network banks (ProCredit group). In Kosovo, ProCredit Bank is a developmentoriented full service bank and focuses in its credit operations on lending to micro, small, and medium size
enterprises (MSMEs), thus contributing significantly to job creation and economic development in
Kosovo. In 2010, ProCredit Bank continued to be the largest commercial bank in Kosovo (by asset size)
and had the largest branch network with 62 offices in 27 different towns and cities across the country.
MIGA’s continuing support to this project signals the Agency’s ability to underwrite projects in the
country and support inward FDI in the energy, financial, infrastructure and agriculture sectors, and thus
add to the World Bank Group’s strategy of encouraging private sector development by addressing real
and perceived bottlenecks in the country’s operating environment.
Lessons Learned
46.
The Bank’s decade-long operational experience, analytical work, and dialogue with national
and external stakeholders offer important lessons for future WBG engagement in Kosovo. On
content, three priorities stand out as follows:


Given Kosovo’s extremely high unemployment rates, it is critical to continue to focus on
accelerating growth and increasing employment opportunities, especially for youth and women;



Related to the above, sustained efforts are needed to address weaknesses in Kosovo’s business
environment as a principal means of fostering private-sector activities and attracting greater
volumes of private investment;



The pattern of growth needs to be consistent with environmental sustainability, including
ensuring that natural resources are used in a manner that minimizes damage to human health.

47.
In addition, there is growing concern that the implementation of projects supported by the
Bank has been slow. Addressing these concerns will involve the following:


Focused outreach to the parliamentarians and civil society during project preparation to ensure
full understanding of the objectives and design, thereby facilitating parliamentary approvals of
projects.



Greater selectivity in new operations, focusing on sustaining momentum in key areas where we
are already engaged, such as energy, education, employment, and the environment;



Instituting regular joint portfolio reviews with the Ministry of Finance to resolve bottlenecks and
strengthening the Country Office in Kosovo to help to provide continuous implementation
support, and capacity building, particularly on modern procurement and financial management.

48.
A recent portfolio review identified opportunities to enhance the gender dimension of
selected projects. The review, conducted by gender and sector specialists, focused on the following
projects: (i) Agriculture and Rural Development; (ii) Real Estate Cadastre and Registration; and (iii) the
Institutional Development for Education Project. The main goal of the review was to identify
opportunities in the projects to incorporate gender in the analysis, design and monitoring and evaluation
framework. In addition, it provided knowledge on some good practices in gender mainstreaming, which
will contribute to a more systematic inclusion of gender issues in future projects. The review identified
the following:


The Agriculture and Rural Development project will increase women’s access to training and
advisory services to enable them to prepare quality grant proposals and business plans. This
would enhance their access to grants to foster competitiveness and growth of their businesses. A
detailed report on female beneficiaries in the agricultural and rural development sector was

18

recently prepared and will serve as the basis for the development of a communication and
outreach campaign targeting women farmers and entrepreneurs. An important goal of the
campaign is to raise female participation in training to at least one third of the total. In addition,
five points have been added to the scoring criteria for rural grant applications submitted by
female applicants to encourage women to participate in the grant competition. It is expected that
the number of grants awarded to women would double (albeit from a low level of about 4.5%) by
2017. Progress in reaching women beneficiaries will be monitored throughout the project.


The Real Estate Cadastre and Registration project will promote women’s property registration
by: (i) increasing outreach targeting women to register their land; (ii) ensuring protection of
women’s property rights on first registration through inter alia redesign of forms to encourage
registration of all owners (not just head of household); (iii) modification of municipal cadastre
office (MCO) practices to ensure full compliance with the Law on Gender Equity and Family
Law in areas of inheritance and land transactions; (iv) specific training for MCOs on women’s
property rights and sensitivity to the special challenges faced by women in property issues; and
(v) ensuring that the project’s planned social survey provides a baseline to monitor progress of
gender indicators in annual follow up surveys. Based on existing data it is estimated that about 20
percent of land is either individually owned by women or jointly titled (2011). The project will
support Government’s efforts to achieve an increase in women’s land ownership of about an
additional 10 percent by 2015.



In the Institutional Development for Education project, school development grants (SDGs) will
support selected schools to prepare and implement multiple-year school development plans which
focus on the enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning activities. Recipient schools will
be selected according to a set of criteria including retention and attendance rates among girls.
Specifically, the six criteria for allocating the SDGs (of up to 15,000 Euro per school) will now
include the Gender Parity Index which receives 10 out of 100 points. The index is calculated as
the number of boys enrolled divided by the number of girls enrolled. In addition, the project will
strengthen the capacity of municipalities to track the status of dropout and retention disaggregated
by gender. The goal is to ensure that about two thirds of municipalities are able to report these
gender statistics through a modern education management information system. This indicator is
tracked through the project ISR.

Role of Other External Partners
49.
Kosovo has many multilateral and bilateral donors that provide support to a range of
sectors at central and local levels, sometimes in concert with Bank operations. The EU and USAID
are the most important donors, with over 300 projects at national and local levels. For 2011–12, the EU
has allocated €140 million for Kosovo from the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) which funds
preparatory activities for investment projects. Kosovo is also eligible to receive funds from the EU’s
Western Balkan Investment Facility (WBIF) for project preparation. Other important partners include
Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Turkey as well as the Bretton Woods institutions and the UN system.
50.
Substantial external donor support has been an important input to Kosovo’s development
efforts, but the Government has only recently put in place a formal mechanism to enhance
coordination. In early 2011, the Government of Kosovo adopted a Regulation on Donor Coordination,
increasing the role of the Government in the coordination of development assistance. The Regulation
creates the High Level Forum, established as a permanent mechanism for the purpose of analyzing and
assessing progress in social and economic development and the efficacy of external aid. The Forum is
chaired by the Prime Minister and comprises the highest officials of the Kosovo Government, donor

19

representatives and other relevant agencies. Decisions of the Forum are transferred to sectoral and subsectoral working groups, which coordinate development assistance in their respective technical areas. The
Forum monitors the general effectiveness of the system of aid based on indicators defined by the Paris
Declaration and defines ways to improve its impact. While still uneven in their effectiveness and impact,
the High Level Forum and the sectoral working groups represent an important step forward in bringing
more order to external assistance efforts, helping to ensure national ownership of development initiatives
and reducing pressures on limited Government capacity.

The WBG works closely with many of these external agencies, including through joint
analytical work and co- or parallel-financing of operations. For example, the Bank is partnering with
the IMF and USAID to provide TA to Kosovo’s financial sector, with the Netherlands, US and EC in the
energy and environment sectors, with Austria in public financial management and with DFID and SIDA
to build capacity for statistical analysis. The Bank and other partners worked towards developing a

20

Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) for the education sector, partly through conduct of a joint feasibility
study under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. A group of nine
external partners have been closely involved in the design and implementation of the Sustainable
Employment Development Policy Program (SEDPP) and have contributed substantial grant resources for
its two budget support operations. Finally, given the importance of the EU perspective for Kosovo, all
World Bank operations are aligned with the criteria for EU accession.
52.
Further possibilities for cooperation between the EC, European IFIs, and the Bank in the
Western Balkans have been opened by the agreement in June 2011 to grant the Bank associate
membership in the WBIF. The WBIF is a financing mechanism designed to pool grants, loans, and
expertise from the EC, IFIs, and bilateral donors to prepare a common pipeline of priority investment
projects that could be financed by any of the WBIF donors. While in other Western Balkan countries, the
Bank cannot act as the lead IFI for WBIF-financed project preparation activities, an exception to this rule
has been agreed for Kosovo, where the Bank—as the only IFI that is fully operational in the country—has
been encouraged to play a leading role in several areas. The Kosovo Government has already submitted a
number of grant proposals to the WBIF Project Financiers Group including for studies on energy
efficiency in public buildings, feasibility and environmental impact analyses for strengthening waste
management (covering municipal and hazardous waste) and feasibility studies for protection of the 50-km
long Ibër Canal. In addition, Kosovo will benefit from a number of regional proposals submitted by SEE
Governments including for a study to examine development options (including financing options) for
implementation of an Energy Community Gas Ring through public-private partnership consortia. These
proposals will be reviewed by the WBIF Project Financiers Group in April 2012 and those which are
positively assessed will be forwarded to the Project Steering Committee for final decisions in June.
B.

WBG Country Partnership Activities for FY12-15

53.
The main objectives of the CPS are to support Kosovo to (i) accelerate broad-based
economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) improve environmental management. The
goal of accelerating broad-based growth and employment creation is essentially a continuation of the
priorities established in previous country strategies. The second objective—promoting better care of the
environment—was less prominent in previous assistance strategies. It is being given higher priority now
because of wider recognition within Government and its development partners that sustainable,
environmentally-sensitive use of Kosovo’s major natural resources and better management/clean-up of
environmental hazards are critical elements of the effort to improve the population’s living standards and
create sustainable employment. Moreover, in light of the findings of the EC’s Progress Report on
Kosovo, it has become clear that significant progress will be needed in environment if the country is to
achieve its longer-run objective of closer integration with the EU.
54.
The CPS has been shaped in important ways by consultations with a wide range of relevant
stakeholders. Apart from its ongoing discussions with the Government, the Bank held several
discussions on the CPS with the President of the Republic, Parliament, the private sector, civil society and
international development partners. All the groups consulted stressed the importance of addressing
medium-term energy security and many were fully supportive of the balanced strategy included in the
CPS. Some civil society groups, however, were critical of any support for the development of a new
lignite-fuelled power plant to replace the existing (highly-polluting) Kosovo A but nonetheless welcomed
other aspects of the CPS energy program aimed at reducing energy losses, promoting energy efficiency
and developing renewable energy sources to the extent feasible. A detailed summary of a full-day
consultation with civil society representatives in early April is given in Annex 2. In addition to energy, a
number of other areas were emphasized during consultations and have been included in the CPS program.
For example, the President viewed the economic empowerment of women as a particularly important
challenge for Kosovo, various parliamentary leaders suggested the need for a clear focus on agriculture

21

and water supply and the private sector suggested the need for continued emphasis on improving the
business climate.
55.
Taking into account the lessons learned from past experience in Kosovo and the limited
lending envelope, the proposed new lending under the CPS program is selective. New lending will
support fewer, larger operations in sectors/sub-sectors where the WBG has a comparative advantage by
virtue of (i) previous experience in Kosovo or relevant work elsewhere in the region; (ii) having
undertaken analytical work that can inform lending; and (iii) synergies between IDA, IFC, and MIGA.
Program design is also influenced by the potential for close cooperation with other external partners,
particularly with a view to supporting Kosovo’s aspirations for EU integration.
Expected Outcomes
Pillar I: Accelerating Broad-Based Growth and Employment Generation
56.
The first pillar of the CPS strategy aims at accelerating broad-based and sustainable
growth through actions in six main areas: (i) strengthening infrastructure, especially energy, including
through promoting private sector participation in large projects via PPPs; (ii) improving the business
climate, supporting the private sector and the financial sector; (iii) strengthening agriculture development;
(iv) continuing to invest in education and skills; (v) promoting sustainable employment and inclusion; and
(vi) strengthening public financial management and anti-corruption efforts.
(i)

Strengthening infrastructure, with a focus on energy

57.
As discussed in Section III, achieving an accelerated growth path in Kosovo will involve
substantial investment in infrastructure and the adoption of PPP approaches for the implementation of
large-scale projects. While Kosovo’s needs with respect to infrastructure are vast, resource limitations
dictate that the Bank supports the sectors selectively, with financial support focused largely on the energy
sector. In addition, the Bank and IFC would support the development of other infrastructure services
through studies and other advisory services. IFC would also seek to selectively provide financial support
to private firms involved in infrastructure projects in Kosovo in areas such as water, transport, solid waste
disposal and energy.
58.
The Government has developed a comprehensive strategy for the energy sector. There is an
urgent need to address problems in Kosovo’s energy sector because (i) frequent power cuts constrain
socioeconomic development (by impeding investment/job creation, disrupting social service provision
and affecting heating availability in winter with consequences for health conditions); (ii) mismanagement
of the sector results in a drain on Kosovo’s scarce budgetary resources; and (iii) the outdated technologies
employed in power generation have a severely negative impact on the environment (both in terms of air
pollution and carbon emissions). To address these issues and, taking into account the limited
opportunities to cost-effectively import electricity from the SEE region, the Government—working
closely with the WBG, EC, and USAID —has identified a strategy to provide more reliable energy
supplies to households and businesses. The strategy is based on development of Kosovo’s domestic
lignite, hydro and other renewable resources, and reducing consumption through demand-side
management and end-use efficiency improvement. The key elements of the Government’s strategy, are
the following:


Phased closure of the 5 inefficient outdated and highly polluting Kosovo A power generation
units by the end of 2017. Since the 40-year old generation units cannot economically be brought
into compliance with the EU Directive for Large Combustion Plants, they need to be closed by

22

2017 at the latest, as required under the Energy Community Treaty. Decommissioning of Kosovo
A will be initiated as soon as feasible with possible support from the EC and other donors.


Development, through private participation, of a state-of-the-art power plant—the New Kosovo
Power Plant (KRPP) and the associated Sibovc SW lignite mine to replace Kosovo A. The
KRPP would comprise two units of 300 MW each, the minimum necessary to enable retirement
of Kosovo A, serve still-unmet domestic demand and barely meet demand growth, even under an
aggressive loss reduction, tariff adjustments, and demand management regime.



Rehabilitating Kosovo B to comply with EU environmental standards through privatization of
that plant.



Establishing cost recovery tariffs (with appropriate life-line pricing provisions and
strengthened social protection programs to protect the poor) as an important element of the
effort to reduce the drain on scarce budget resources and encourage energy savings by users.



Privatizing KEK Distribution as a means of improving its efficiency and gaining better control
over the rampant losses of electricity due to technical losses and theft.



Improving end-use energy efficiency through investments in energy efficiency in public
buildings and household incentives for energy saving measures.



Developing the country’s limited hydropower and other renewable resources.

The European Commission and the Bank plan to co-host a donor conference in September 2012 to raise
financing for the closure of Kosovo A and for energy efficiency and renewables projects.
59.
When fully implemented, the Government Strategy would yield significant environmental
benefits. Compared to business as usual, the proposed strategy would put Kosovo on a lower carbon path.
Demand-side management and efficiency improvements through privatization of electricity distribution
are expected to reduce technical and commercial losses from the current level of about 40 percent to
around 13 percent by 2025. Improvement in end-use energy efficiency will be supported through an IDA
project. The new 600-MW KRPP—together with a rehabilitated Kosovo B and development of the full
hydropower potential available—would, by end-2017, replace (i) Kosovo A; (ii) imports of about 500
GW from the regional grid; and (iii) about 150 MW in small diesel generation back-up supply. This
change is expected to yield significant environmental benefits by reducing the annual emission of dust by
more than 90 percent (from a current level of 20,000 tons), and nitrogen and sulfur oxides by about two
thirds from their current very high levels (nitrogen oxide about 12,000 tons and sulfur oxide about 14,000
tons) resulting in significant improvements in air quality in Pristina, with concomitant reductions in
adverse health impacts on the population.
60.
The Government has requested the WBG to provide support for several elements of the
above strategy, including provision of a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) to bidders on the
development of KRPP/Sibovc and rehabilitation of Kosovo B. To determine its response to the
Government request, the Bank appointed a panel of external experts to assess whether potential Bank
support for KRPP under the aforementioned Government strategy would be consistent with the Bank’s
―Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change‖ (SFDCC). The expert panel report, issued
in January 2012, concluded that the proposed KRPP/Sibovc project complies with the six criteria of the
SFDCC. It also recommended several complementary actions, all of which are fully consistent with
Government’s overall energy strategy. The Panel’s main recommendations involve: (i) improving energy
efficiency, including through regulation to promote energy efficiency in new building construction; (ii)
reducing technical and commercial losses, partly through privatization of electricity distribution; (iii)
further emphasizing renewables, including assessment of wind potential, increased use of solar power for
water heating, and the adoption of regional strategies for renewables and natural gas; (iv) including

23

externalities in future analysis of energy projects and preparing an environmental baseline; (v)
considering the use of lignite drying to increase the efficiency of the power plant; and (vi) ensuring
openness and transparency on energy projects through a well-developed consultation process.
61.
In light of the conclusions of the Expert Panel, the Bank will proceed with preparation of
support for the KRPP/Sibovc investment through offering an IDA PRG and possible
complementary support from IFC and MIGA. WBG credit-enhancement support (including the PRG)
would be offered on a ―non-binding, in principle‖ basis, in conjunction with issuance of Government’s
Request for Proposals (RfP) to pre-qualified bidders on the proposed project. A final decision on WBG
support would be subject, inter alia, to compliance with all applicable WBG requirements, including those
related to social and environmental issues, review and acceptance of the ownership, management,
financing structure and transaction documents and approval by the management and Executive Directors
of the World Bank Group. The PRG offered by IDA for the KRPP/Sibovc project would amount to
approximately US$58 million (of which, only US$14.5 million or 25 percentage would be counted
against Kosovo’s IDA-16 allocation). This would help to mitigate investor perception of the high risks of
investing in Kosovo and enable bidders to raise commercial financing at lower cost and with longer
maturities. IFC would be prepared, in principle, to consider providing financing for its own account to the
Operator, as well as assist in mobilizing additional funds from other international financial institutions
and from commercial banks where possible, subject to its investment criteria and approvals. IFC will
continue to work with the Kosovo Government as the lead transaction adviser for the privatization of
KEK Distribution, coordinating closely with USAID, which has been supporting management
improvements at the enterprise. In addition to serving as transaction advisor for KEK distribution, IFC
would also coordinate closely with the Bank and MIGA to seek additional ways of supporting the
Government’s energy sector strategy in particular by bringing to bear its global expertise to attract serious
strategic investors to the sector. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) would be conducted to
determine ways of mitigating the impact of higher tariffs on poor households—including through life-line
pricing and strengthened social assistance programs.
62.
The Bank will also support several other elements of the Government’s energy strategy,
including energy efficiency and development of renewable energy, reduction of environmental
hazards, monitoring of air, soil and water quality associated with the power plants and
strengthening capacity to regulate the energy and environment sectors in a manner consistent with
EU standards. Support in these areas—including an Energy Efficiency and Renewables Project and
Additional Financing for the Energy Sector Clean-Up and Land Reclamation Project—is described in
detail in Pillar II.
63.
CPS outcome for energy: WBG support for Government’s energy strategy will significantly
strengthen sectoral production capacity, efficiency and financial and environmental sustainability.
Given the time frame necessary for implementation of the projects, this outcome is likely to be realized in
the next CPS. The PRG for KRPP/Sibovc would have an important impact on electricity availability and
successful conclusion of the privatization of KEK Distribution would result in increased efficiency as a
result of reduced technical and commercial losses (including theft). These two operations together would
also significantly lessen the need for budgetary support to the energy sector, thus freeing up scarce
budgetary resources for other key uses. The Energy Efficiency and Renewables Project would help to
achieve significant reductions in the need for thermal power generation.
(ii)

Promoting private sector development and financial sector strengthening

64.
The second main element of the growth pillar helps Kosovo to increase its attractiveness to
both domestic and foreign business investors by supporting a number of actions to improve the regulatory
and institutional frameworks for business entry and operations and to strengthen the financial sector.

24

65.
CPS outcome: The environment for business operations has improved as a result of
simplified regulations and processes and rules for business entries/exits and external trade has been
simplified: The on-going Business Environment TA project is successfully helping to reduce regulatory

compliance costs for businesses, harmonize business regulations and the licensing framework at
the central and municipal level, and secure immovable property rights. Building on a component of
the ongoing Business Environment TA project, the Real Estate and Cadastre Project (RECAP) supports,
inter alia, (i) the Municipal Cadastre Offices (MCOs) by financing physical upgrades to facilities and
completing and updating real estate cadastre and registration records in the Immovable Property Rights
Register; (ii) the transformation of the Kosovo Cadastre Agency (KCA) into an autonomous and selffinancing body with capacity to work with municipal offices and ensure uniformity in property
transactions; and (iii) the KCA to manage the project, monitor/evaluate the project’s progress, organize
public information events, and coordinate donor support. In addition to the annual analysis of Kosovo’s
business climate within the framework of the joint Bank/IFC Doing Business Reports, IFC advisory
assistance could include: (i) regulatory simplification on the national and sub-national levels to help to
reduce the cost and risk of doing business; and (ii) addressing the regulatory impediments for business
start up and operation as well as for the efficient flow of goods into and out of Kosovo.
66.
CPS outcome: Local corporations in productive sectors are already growing at an
accelerated pace: IFC would support continued growth of competitive companies in agribusiness,
manufacturing and services sectors. In particular, IFC will help local corporations overcome financing
constraints through long-term financing combined with related advisory services. In this regard, IFC
expects to support 1–2 projects in these sectors per year. MIGA could also provide guarantees to SMEs
and small-scale agricultural and services projects through its Small Investment Program.
67.
CPS outcome: The regulatory and institutional frameworks for the financial system have
been substantially strengthened and a modern deposit insurance scheme is in place. The WBG,
working with key partners such as the IMF and USAID, has been heavily involved in supporting the
regulatory and institutional reform of Kosovo’s financial system over the past few years and will continue
its support during this CPS through the ongoing IDA-financed Financial Sector Strengthening Market
Infrastructure Project (FSSMIP), approved by the Board in mid-2011. Among other activities, the project
has already helped to establish a Deposit Insurance Fund, is reforming the payments system, supporting
the implementation of an RTGS and developing a business continuity center. A corporate governance
review of financial institutions undertaken last year will be followed up by two ROSCs on accounting
and auditing and insolvency and creditor rights, both of which will be completed in FY12. AAA will also
be provided during FY12–13 through a FIRST grant to harmonize existing regulations and procedures
with Kosovo’s new Banking Law, and to ensure conformity with EU practices. In addition, at
Government’s request, the Bank and IMF will conduct a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
review in FY12–13, which will assess strengths and potential vulnerabilities and means of risk reduction.
While the Bank has focused on strengthening the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the
financial sector, IFC will explore the possibility of working with the banks with a focus on agribusiness,
gender finance, climate change and SMEs. IFC will also consider supporting the microfinance
institutions.
68.
CPS outcome: SME’s have gained increased access to credit. With respect to financing for
SMEs as well, the Bank and IFC will work closely together, with the Bank concentrating on the
regulatory framework and IFC providing financing and advisory services to support SME-oriented private
financing institutions, as well as competitive SMEs. One key Bank input during the CPS period will be a
Corporate Governance Review of Banking and Micro Finance Sector, using a methodology that was
developed by the Bank, based on inputs from other supervisory and rating agencies, but substantially
leveraging off of the newly issued Basel Committee’s Principles for Corporate Governance. In addition,
the Bank, utilizing resources from the Balkan TA facility will provide technical support to regulatory

25

framework for microfinance. This work, which will be undertaken in FY12, will involve working with the
Central Bank to develop the best structures for micro-finance from a regulatory viewpoint. For its part,
IFC will seek to strengthen Kosovo’s micro-finance institutions, in conjunction with a suitable strategic
partner.
(iii)

Strengthening agriculture development

69.
CPS outcome: Agricultural growth and competitiveness have been boosted through
provision of new technologies and rural development grants to agricultural producers. The ongoing
Agriculture and Rural Development project seeks to increase agricultural production and competitiveness
in Kosovo through two main sets of activities: (i) establishment of a program of rural grants to encourage
investment in agriculture and promote the use of improved agricultural technologies; and (ii) strengthen
the knowledge of farm operators, agro-processing enterprise managers and municipal advisors to
effectively plan investments and utilize the financial support available under the rural grant program.
During the FY12–15 CPS period, the project’s grant program will be expanded through a Danish grant of
50 million kroner (about US$9 million equivalent), thus nearly doubling the resources available for rural
investment. Additionally, the project will be reviewed during this CPS period to ensure that it reaches out
adequately to women as well as men, with adjustments made to its outreach and capacity building
components to increase gender sensitivity as appropriate. As with the original project, Danish grant funds
will be managed through a Managing Authority (MA) and Paying Unit (PU) established with the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development. The MA and PU have been designed to be fully in line
with the requirements for Paying Agencies under the EU’s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance for
Rural Development (IPARD) so that they will be competent to satisfactorily manage IPARD funds once
Kosovo becomes eligible to receive them. In addition, through its regional agribusiness advisory project,
IFC will contribute to increased Kosovo’s agribusiness sector competitiveness and exports.
(iv)

Investing in education and skills

70.
CPS outcome: The relevance and quality of education has been strengthened. Kosovo’s
education system currently falls short in terms of quality and relevance. The Bank-supported ongoing
Institutional Development for Education Project (IDEP) for Kosovo—developed in partnership with the
Ministry of Education and a number of donors—is already helping Government in the implementation of
the strategy for the development of pre-university education in Kosovo and the strategy for the
development of higher education. Its main focus is on strengthening the systems, institutions and
management capacities needed for education quality improvements. It also encompasses infrastructure
planning and investment improvements and institutes a school grants program to support demand-driven
initiatives throughout the school system. When designed in FY08, the project did not specifically target
issues of girls’ access to secondary and post-secondary education, but a gender assessment will be
undertaken to capture the extent of and identify the factors exacerbating gender disparities to inform
future projects. In addition, one of the criteria for the allocation of school development grants is the extent
of gender disparities (enrollment and retention rates), and the project will document the impact of these
school grants. The Education Improvement Project planned for this CPS period will continue broader
efforts in improving education quality and efficiency but also include a clear focus on means of
improving girls’ access to secondary and post-secondary education. The new project, currently
programmed for FY14, will be financed through an IDA credit of about US$10 million.
(v)

Promoting Sustainable Employment and Inclusion

71.
CPS objective: Policies and institutions increasingly promote sustainable employment. The
Bank is preparing a second and final operation in support of the Sustainable Employment Development
Policy Program. The program’s multi-pronged approach expands on efforts in other CPS areas and

26

supports actions to strengthen policies and institutions governing (i) macro-economic and public financial
management; (ii) the investment climate; (iii) labor markets; (iv) education, training and skills; and, (v)
social protection. In its final phase, the program will strengthen procurement processes, salary systems for
civil servants and the monitoring of expenditures. It will reduce barriers to register businesses, improve
the access of customers to credit data, and establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for Banks and
other financial institutions. In addition, the final phase of the program will expand public works
programs, strengthen other labor market programs, and establish a comprehensive regulatory framework
for the labor market. It will provide for a national qualifications framework and support the accreditation
of vocational training institutions; furthermore, it will improve the targeting and management of social
assistance programs. Following the second Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation, a
programmatic analytical advisory activity will provide technical assistance throughout the CPS period
to further strengthen the policies and institutions governing the labor market, training and skills
development, and social protection, including health financing.
72.
CPS Outcome: Social inclusion in poor communities and marginalized population groups is
supported. Two grants from the peace and state building fund are supporting social cohesion through: (i)
rehabilitation of small-scale social and economic infrastructure in the poorest villages and in
mixed/minority communities as well as promoting MSMEs in a socially inclusive manner; and (ii) youth
services, youth employment and inter-ethnic collaboration among youth, especially from marginalized
and vulnerable groups.
(vi)

Strengthening Public Financial Management, Procurement and Anti-corruption Efforts

73.
CPS outcome: Public financial management has been modernized particularly with respect
to public investments monitoring, efficient payroll management, transparent procurement and
anti-corruption actions. Complementing the public sector management improvements included in the
SEDPP (i.e., strengthening public investment management, consolidated procurement and transparency in
payroll management), the Government is also seeking to further improve public sector governance by (i)
implementing a public financial management reform action plan; (ii) increasing the efficiency of
procurement through e-procurement and consolidated procurement (Quick Gains reform); and (iii)
reforming the civil service (see Box 3 below). The Bank is supporting these reform efforts through the
ongoing Public Sector Modernization Project (PSMP). In addition, the Bank has recently completed a
Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA) FY12 report and shared a draft with the Government.
74.
In order to follow up on the key recommendations stated in the CFA, the World Bank—in
cooperation with other development partners—would support the Kosovo Government with
technical assistance to assist the Government in (i) monitoring enforcement of the PPL, improving
procurement implementation and contract management, and building capacity within the procuring
authorities and private sector; (ii) establishing a system for the performance evaluation of procurement
officers and professional growth of procurement officers; (iii) conducting a PEFA assessment and using
its findings to refine the PFM reform action plan; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of the Central
Procurement Agency (CPA) to conduct procurement of ―common use‖ goods. In addition, the project
would work with the Anti-Corruption Agency to follow-up on the integrity related recommendations and
issues emanating from the CFA, working in partnership with other accountability institutions and donors.
Throughout the CPS period, the Bank will track the Government progress in implementing the CFA
recommendations and will maintain high level of vigilance in ongoing and planned operations through
thorough fraud and corruption assessments of each operation, implementation of smart controls and
accountability measures, and enhanced fiduciary reviews during project implementation.

27

Box 3: Public Procurement Laws, Country Fiduciary Assessment, Corruption and Governance
In the area of public procurement, the Government's main goal is to align its legislation with the EU
Procurement Directives. To that end, the Public Procurement Law (PPL) in Kosovo has undergone frequent
changes in the recent years aiming increased alignment and improvement of the overall institutional framework in
public procurement. The World Bank conducted a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA) in Kosovo in 2010 which
went through 2011. The assessment report is expected to be finalized in December 2011. Amid the assessment, a
new PPL was approved by the Assembly on September 30, 2010 and was further amended on September 19, 2011.
The CFA team reviewed both versions of the PPL and provided the Government with comprehensive comments,
majority of which were addressed by the Government in the final version. Generally, the current PPL reflects
adequately the main principles of a sound procurement system and is consistent with international good practices.
The EU Commission refers in its 2011 progress report as ―this version of the PPL addresses most of the
deficiencies of the previous law and significantly increases the compatibility with EU standards‖. The main
institutional changes brought by the current amendment include inter alia: transformation of the Public Procurement
Agency ("PPA") from an independent agency with mixed roles and responsibilities to a Centralized Purchasing
Agency (CPA) within the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to be in charge of conducting centralized procurement; and the
contract signing was further clarified to involve senior staff of the contracting authority in signing high value
contracts in addition to the procurement officer.
However, Kosovo public procurement system is still in need of improving its performance. The legislative
framework needs further refinements as it needs to be supplemented by the necessary implementing regulations,
procurement manuals and tender documents including general conditions of contracts which have not been updated
in parallel with the PPL. Monitoring enforcement of the PPL, improving procurement implementation and contract
management, building capacity within the procuring authorities and private sector based on training needs
assessment are areas of need of improvement. The Government also needs to establish a system for the performance
evaluation of procurement officers and to include in the civil administration a clear path for growth of procurement
officers.
The public financial management system in Kosovo, in general, has shown steady improvements since
independence was declared. The key strengths of the system are the sound legal framework, integrated central
treasury system and an increasingly effective external audit office. The strengths are offset by limited professional
and technical capacities and gaps in implementation. There is considerable scope for improving the quality of budget
planning and preparation, internal financial control and audit, debt management and capital investment management.
Kosovo authorities are aware of their limitations and progress is occurring, with support from international bodies,
including the World Bank.
The Government recognizes that corruption is still widespread with several high profile Cases currently
under investigation. The key areas affected include procurement, civil works, transport, energy, health and land
administration. Progress has been made on Procurement Code of Ethics, launch of an Internet website carrying full
details of public procurement, and commencement of a procurement training program. Further work is still needed
to develop a debarment mechanism, institute due diligence on bids reviews, scale-up compliance reviews, and build
capacity to successfully prosecute high-profile Cases.

75.
CPS outcome: The capacity for statistical data collection and relevant analysis has been
reinforced and data are being used more systematically by policymakers. Poverty monitoring would
be supported by collection of data from a number of sources, including a donor-financed AAA activity to
support GOK to collect and analyze household level data. Under this AAA activity, the Bank will provide
TA in three focal areas: monitoring poverty, inequality, gender differences and exclusion; strengthening
capacity for data collection and analysis; and addressing emerging knowledge gaps. There will be a strong
focus on expanding the use of data collected by the Statistical Office of Kosovo (SOK), and other data
sources by a wider group of analysts and, ultimately, decision-makers in Kosovo, including through the
creation of a data users' network comprising analysts from SOK, various Government departments,
academic institutions and think-tanks. A series of training events and knowledge-sharing workshops are
planned to help to establish and nurture this network, drawing in large part from experiences in
neighboring countries, with appropriate adaptation to the Kosovo context. The activity will be

28

complemented by and coordinated with Bank-financed AAA to monitor gender, which will be ongoing
throughout the CPS period.
Pillar II: Improving Environmental Management

76.
The second pillar of the CPS strategy seeks to improve environmental management,
particularly by supporting the Government to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewables,
reducing environmental hazards, enhancing water supply and moving towards harmonization with EU
environmental standards. The main activities envisaged for the CPS period, are described below:
(i)

Improving energy efficiency and increasing energy production from renewable sources

77.
CPS Objective: Efficiency in energy use and generation from renewable resources has been
increased, thus reducing carbon emissions. The Government and the Bank are developing a proposed
US$32.5 million Energy Efficiency and Renewables Project (FY13), modeled on similar Bank-supported
projects in the region. GTZ has trained about 50 energy auditors and USAID has completed some
demonstration projects retrofitting schools in Kosovo. In addition, the Government has submitted an
application to the WBIF for grant funding for an energy audit and preparation of feasibility studies for
energy efficiency investments in public service buildings (Government offices, schools, hospitals, or oldage homes). Building on these activities, the project would aim to retrofit public buildings to substantially
reduce their energy consumption and strengthen the supply-chain through training of energy auditors,
contractors, vendors and equipment suppliers. The project would also seek to reduce pollution and
emissions caused by widespread use of liquid-fuel generators and firewood for household heating inter
alia by providing households with incentives to improve energy efficiency and adopt cleaner heating
methods. In this regard, the World Bank Institute is helping with assessment of market potential for
energy efficiency investments, cost estimates and financing options, institutional capacity strengthening,
and preparation of an energy-efficiency diagnostic for the Municipality of Pristina. In addition to
efficiency investments, the proposed project will support development of renewable energy sources
through exploration of geothermal and wind potential, preparation of feasibility studies for projects to be
offered to the private sector, developing model concession agreements, and potentially provision of a
credit enhancement to the local banks to finance mini-hydro and solar power plants, as well as renewable
projects for households (e.g., solar water heating and small biogas for heating).
78.
In designing the renewable energy component of the Energy Efficiency and Renewables
Project, the Bank will coordinate closely with the IFC’s Balkans Renewable Energy Advisory
Program (BREP), launched in 2010. BREP is already operational in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina
and FYR Macedonia. IFC intends to expand BREP to Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro. BREP objectives
are to improve the renewable energy regulatory framework, help renewable energy sponsors to improve
their project designs and business plans, and support financial institutions to improve their internal
capacities and knowledge on renewable energy. BREP’s Advisory Services in Kosovo will be focused on
the following areas: (i) at the regulatory level, the program will help with the creation of a standardized
PPA, grid connection agreement and concession contract for small hydro power projects, improvements
in primary and/or secondary legislation, and better alignment of regulation from different sectors related
to small hydro project development (water management, forestry, environmental regulation); (ii) at the
firm level, the program will help with better design of small hydro projects, wind farms (if there is any
investors' interest), and biomass plants (with proper incentive support); (iii) in terms of financing, since
there is limited interest from local Kosovo banks in developing renewable energy products, the program
will closely coordinate with IFC’s investment services in both the financial market and infrastructure
sectors to explore investment opportunities in renewable energy projects.

29

(ii)
Reducing environmental hazards improving environmental monitoring and management
and improving priority-setting
79.
CPS Objective: Environmental hazards around the site of the Kosovo A and B power plants
have been significantly reduced and there is substantially strengthened capacity for environmental
monitoring. The Bank and donor-financed Energy Sector Cleanup and Land Reclamation Project
(CLRP) has been under implementation for several years and was planned to close in FY12, having met
all its development objectives. These original expected outcomes were partial in some cases (due largely
to funding limitations) implying that a part of the work on ash dump remediation and land reclamation
would remain for completion by Government after the project’s original closing date (June 2012).
However, given the importance of the clean up to the quality of life of the communities surrounding the
power plant site and feedback from consultations with civil society representatives, this CPS includes a
proposed Additional Financing for the Energy Sector Clean up and Land Reclamation Project (US$3.2
million), which, inter alia, will finance: (i) extension of the coverage of the clean-up and land reclamation
efforts at the site of the Kosovo A and B power plants; (ii) environmental monitoring of air, soil and
water associated with power generation; (iii) strengthening the capacity of Kosovo’s environmental and
energy regulatory authorities; (iv) environmental and social assessments for energy projects; and (v)
preparation of a low carbon growth strategy and a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. The AF will be
complemented by a Netherlands Government grant of about US$1,165,000.
80.
CPS outcome: Broader appreciation of environmental issues and of strategies for
addressing them throughout Government and among stakeholders. At Government’s request, the
Bank is undertaking a Country Environmental Analysis (FY12), with the objective of establishing
environmental development priorities based on an analysis of the state of the environment and estimates
of the economic costs of environmental degradation. The study will be based on internationally derived
epidemiological research regarding the relationship between the affected population exposed to
environmental issues and the increased risks of health impacts in order to estimate the disease burden in
Kosovo caused by environmental neglect and its associated economic impacts thereof. While the figures
derived from these analyses will be indicative rather than precise, they will provide a reasonably good
picture of the costs of environmental neglect and propose practical approaches for reversing past practices
to more environmentally sustainable ones. Following discussion of the draft report with the Government
(late FY12), there will be an intensive dissemination effort within Kosovo—involving a wide range of
stakeholders at national and local levels—to both discuss the study’s findings and begin to develop
effective, nationally-owned strategies for prioritizing among issues and developing practical action plans
to address them through legislative, regulatory and institutional changes.
(iii)

Increasing access to water

81.
CPS Objective: Better and more equitable access to water of appropriate quality according
to use. In FY11, the Bank undertook a comprehensive water sector assessment at Government’s request
to serve as a key input to the country’s national water resources strategy. Inter alia, the water assessment
reviewed the potential for using water resources to foster productive investments and analyze current and
projected water uses in different sectors—water supply, sanitation, irrigation, hydropower and
industrial—from a spatial planning perspective. Taking into account the study’s recommendations, the
Government has requested that the Bank finance a Water Supply Project. This project has been included
in the proposed CPS program for FY15, for an amount of US$18 million. The project would help ensure
the security (in terms of adequacy of supply and quality) of water in the Pristina region (including energy
sector, business and domestic water consumption needs). At this stage, it is expected that the Water
Supply project will include some of the following activities: (i) securing of uninterrupted water supply of
good quality from the Ibër-Lepenc canal through repair of the canal, protection against physical damage,
short-term storage along the canal, and improved canal management; (ii) protection measures for drinking

30

water reservoirs; and (iii) investments to improve the quality of water supply to communities living in the
vicinity of the power plants.
C.

The CPS Financing Program

82.
Although the program of Bank supported operations amounts to over US$180 million, a
significant proportion of these resources are derived from special grants and TFs. The overall size of
the IDA envelope for the first three years of the CPS period is about SDR 36.8 million (US$58 million).
An additional SDR 11.3 million or US$18 million equivalent is included for FY15, but since these funds
will depend on IDA 17 they are only notional at this stage. Actual IDA allocations beyond FY12 will
depend on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the performance
and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA's assistance to Kosovo (grants or
credits); and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on
performance, and the US dollar equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate.
83.
The allocation of the IDA-16 resources of SDR 36.8 million (US$58 million) and the notional
amount of SDR11.3 million (US$18 million) is distributed as shown in table 6. At this stage, we
expect that the IDA contribution for energy sector PRGs will amount to approximately US$14.5 million,
allowing for IDA partial risk guarantees up to US$58 million. This amount will likely be supplemented
by IFC and MIGA as previously discussed.

Risks

84.

The implementation of the FY12-15 CPS entails four main risks as follows:

31



Kosovo’s uneven track record in fiscal management raises questions about medium-term
macroeconomic stability, and an economic downturn in Europe would exacerbate this risk.
The Government’s growing experience in macro-economic management has been supported by
several external partners, notably the IMF, the EC, USAid, and the Bank. Continued financial and
advisory support—together with the difficulties in obtaining financing from abroad— should
convince policymakers to maintain a prudent fiscal stance. Moreover, an IMF SBA is expected to
be in place for a 20 month period beginning in April 2012. The SBA should help to reduce fiscal
risks, especially in the event that Kosovo’s economy is impacted by an economic downturn in
Europe (which could result in lower revenue and remittances). It should be noted, too, that Bank
support through the PSMP and SEDPP actions will help to improve priority-setting for public
expenditures and improve budget discipline over time.



The WBG planned support for the KRPP has generated opposition from some civil society
groups and hence involvement in the project entails reputational risk. While investment in
Kosovo’s energy sector is critical to growth, job creation and poverty reduction, the Bank’s
involvement in the new lignite-fuelled power generation plant has already generated controversy
among some civil society groups and this opposition is likely to continue throughout the CPS
period. This risk is being addressed through ensuring transparent processes and regular
dialogue/outreach throughout project development.



An additional risk is that, given continued turmoil in financial markets (especially in
Europe), power project financing may not be easy to obtain. The availability of WBG
guarantees should to mitigate this risk. Credit enhancement from other multilateral lenders would
also help catalyze needed funds from the private sector.



Kosovo’s governance and political structures are fragile and could destabilize under certain
shocks. Kosovo’s young and relatively untested institutions render it vulnerable to domestic
unrest and political pressures. The tense situation in Northern Kosovo, though currently contained
to about 4 municipalities, demonstrates this risk. Moreover, Kosovo’s governance systems still
lack full transparency, accountability, and viability. Governance and political developments will
need to be closely followed as related problems could undermine external development support
activities. Actions to support improved public financial management included in the CPS and in
the ongoing PSMP project should help to reduce this risk. The Bank will also carry out
programmatic AAA to follow on the recommendations of the Country Fiduciary Assessment,
including support for anti-corruption initiatives.

Annex 2: Summary of the Consultation on the Proposed World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy for Kosovo for FY12-15 with Civil Society Organizations
World Bank Office in Kosovo, Wednesday, April 4, 2012
The World Bank office in Pristina sent invitations to a large number of CSOs, to discuss the
proposed CPS for Kosovo for FYs12-15. The invitation included a detailed powerpoint
presentation on the proposed CPS and an Agenda for the consultation meeting comprising six
guiding questions as well as links to key reports available on the Bank’s website (Country
Economic Memorandum, Public Expenditure Review, Development and Evaluation of Power
Supply Options for Kosovo, Report of the SFDCC External Expert Panel, and South East Europe
Regular Economic Report). All the reports, as well as the PPT and Agenda, were translated into
Albanian and made available well in advance of the meeting. The consultation meeting took
place on April 4, 2012 in the new premises of the World Bank Office in Kosovo and lasted for a
full day with lunch provided. The World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia,
Philippe Le Houérou opened the meeting with introductory remarks on the proposed CPS for
Kosovo. The meeting was moderated by the World Bank’s Senior Advisor, Theodore Ahlers.
The Bank’s Country Director for the Western Balkans, Jane Armitage, was also present. The
Country Manager for Kosovo, Jan-Peter Olters, delivered a presentation on the key messages of
the proposed CPS to kick-off the discussion.
Mr. Philippe Le Houérou’s opening remarks:
As the World Bank moved from an Interim Strategy Note for Kosovo to a Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), it was an important moment in the partnership between the Bank and Kosovo.
The Bank fully supported Kosovo’s goal of joining the European Union and recognized that the
EU could help Kosovo to lift its people out of poverty. Given the importance of diagnosis for
shaping this first CPS for Kosovo, it was essential to discuss the Bank’s diagnosis underlying the
CPS. Bank staff believed that jobs and growth were critical and so the Bank focused the first
CPS pillar on jobs. In the second pillar, the Bank had a clear focus on environmental
management, reflecting the Bank’s assessment that this was critical for the well-being of
Kosovars. In so doing, the Bank wanted to help to balance environmental management with
growth and job creation. Energy straddled both pillars of the proposed CPS – electricity
shortages remained a key constraint to private investment and jobs, and inefficiencies in the
sector were a key contributing factor to environmental pollution.
Mr. Ted Ahlers’ opening remarks:
Mr. Ahlers noted that this was one of many consultations held in Kosovo over the past four
years. The purposes of the full-day consultation were to get the CSOs’ views on the proposed
CPS, to answer their questions, and have a discussion on areas of concern. The Bank was
preparing to go to the Board in late May or June with this CPS, leaving plenty of time to give
due consideration to CSO concerns. To ensure that all issues were addressed, the Bank had
previously distributed a detailed, powerpoint presentation on the CPS and an agenda for the

38

consultations including six guiding questions for the discussion. The powerpoint presentation
and agenda are available on line at www.worldbank.org/kosovo.
Mr. Ahlers noted that many things in the proposed CPS have changed over the past year, based
on the Bank’s ongoing consideration of Kosovo’s development challenges and inputs from civil
society and the private sector.
Short presentation on the proposed CPS by Mr. Jan-Peter Olters:
Mr. Olters told participants that the CPS is dynamic and could be modified when warranted
through the CPS Progress Report. The Bank would continue listening to the ongoing dialogue in
Kosovo even after the World Bank document goes to the Board. The overarching objective of the
strategy was to increase growth and domestic productivity. Mr. Olters noted that civil society has
had positive influence on the CPS, as reflected in the scope of projects being proposed.
Agenda Item 1: Is the World Bank’s diagnosis of the challenges facing Kosovo correct?
Questions were focused on the economic and social development priorities in the proposed CPS,
specifically whether the only strategy for growth in Kosovo was EU integration. A question was
raised about whether the Bank’s consideration of support for a new power plant could actually be
an obstacle to EU integration. There were also questions about the expected outcomes of the CPS
and how success would be measured and why the Bank put the energy project in the category of
growth when it is unclear how it will specifically help to create jobs. The moderator asked the
participants to focus on the diagnosis question for this first agenda point, noting that, if one
started with an agreed diagnosis, one could more easily move to how to address Kosovo’s
development challenges. Comments were made about perceived contradictions in the strategy,
the identification of risks in the CPS, and if jobs and environment were the diagnosed challenges,
then what specifically would the World Bank be doing about it? One member of civil society
noted that the Bank should be implementing ―job-building projects.‖
A representative of KEK employees asked whether there was a specific approach to handling the
employees who currently worked at the power plants once Kosovo A was closed. If the first
priority was the creation of jobs, why would the Bank include a project that would limit them at
the power plants? The representative noted that Kosovo A, while unsustainable, employed about
1500 workers, with an average age of 50 years. Kosovars were concerned about giving the local
capacity of Kosovo B to a private company. He noted that this did not have the support of the
employees of the union of workers.
In terms of the challenges and constraints, there was general agreement that jobs and the
environment were the main issues in Kosovo. A question was raised about why the World Bank
was considering support to a new power plant if the environment was a problem.
Mr. Le Houérou asked about other ideas on how to create a thriving private sector that could
create jobs because not everyone could be a civil servant. What would be the driver of the
economy going forward – remittances? How did one build a thriving private sector? He asked for
the views of the participants on where they saw the growth coming from, underlining that the
diagnosis on this was critical. How could Kosovo go from the current GDP per capita to that of
39

Slovenia and then to that of a country such as England? What were the economic and social
impediments to that? Mr. Le Houérou noted that if there was no agreement on the diagnosis then
it was very hard to have an agreement on solutions.
A representative of the Community Development Fund, which is implementing the World Bankfunded Social Inclusion and Local Development Project, asked whether there would be other
projects of this type financed by the Bank in Kosovo, commenting that the direct link between
building a new power plant and jobs was not clear. She agreed that unemployment was a big
problem but pointed out that she did not see how the proposed CPS addressed that.
A representative of Development 4 Democracy listed as a challenge the low productivity and
Kosovo’s competition in the jobs market. The Labor Union noted that thousands of workers
would be sent home but what was the productivity currently? Other questions were raised about
the Bank’s strategy for addressing women’s unemployment, the government policy of borrowing
funds for highways, and how the World Bank felt Kosovars should be addressing their
indebtedness and the future.
One participant pointed out that industry competitiveness should be listed specifically in the
development strategy. A representative of KIPRED highlighted the rule of law as a challenge for
curbing unemployment. Claiming that 40 percent of Kosovo’s economy was in the black market,
he recommended that the World Bank built mechanisms to shift the black economy into a formal
economy so there was actual data and policies in order for the issues to be addressed more easily.
He expressed the view that rule of law and education should be the main pillars.
One participant suggested investing in local products and encouraging local farmers, noting that
the World Bank was enriching the government and creating oligarchs rather than supporting
entrepreneurs. The CDF representative mentioned that the World Bank was indeed supporting
small and micro enterprises through SILED project, but that she hoped that the Bank would have
more money for this type of support in the future.
World Bank Country Director, Ms. Jane Armitage, acknowledged that the Bank’s consideration
of supporting the new power plant was controversial. She noted that preparation of the project
was still at a very early stage and that there would be many opportunities for in-depth discussions
with CSOs as preparation proceeded. She indicated that the proposed CPS had changed to reflect
previous discussions with CSOs, namely by adding a Water project to improve water supply and
quality for households, businesses and agriculture and a Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency project which would be the largest project over the next four years in Kosovo. She
also informed the participants that there were plans to hold a Donor Conference in September on
supporting the closure of Kosovo A and enabling further investments in renewable energy and
energy efficiency. Ms. Armitage noted that the Bank is supporting and will continue to support
employment under the new CPS and urged the group to look at the current portfolio and the
pipeline of future projects, emphasizing that the World Bank was already financing important
projects in agriculture, education, business climate improvement, cadastre and the financial
sector which all help support job creation. In addition, the Bank has provided €33 million in
budget support for a Sustainable Employment Development Policy Operation to strengthen the
institutional and regulatory environment for employment creation. Ms. Armitage noted that the
European Commission supports development of the new power plant project (which would be
40

fully consistent with EU environmental requirements) and that a priority for many of Kosovo’s
partners (including the EU) was to close the old, highly polluting Kosovo A Power Plant.
A representative of the education unions highlighted the importance of reforms in the education
sector, concluding that not much had changed in the Kosovo schools as they lacked the tools to
become modern. He questioned the results of the promised strategies in the education sector and
underlined that children should not fail for lack of education.
The Director of Kosovo’s Center for Gender Studies considered that the proposed CPS lacked a
gender focus. She suggested that gender issues should be included in all the projects. As an
example, she wanted to see in the CPS the unemployment figures for women. The improvements
in gender aspects proposed in the CPS were deemed by her as insufficient.
A World Bank consultant working on the agriculture and cadastre sector provided information
on the gender aspects of some Bank-funded projects. He mentioned that both the ongoing
agriculture and cadastre projects include design features that promote women’s legitimate rights
through, for example, special outreach efforts, training for business development and secure title
to land.
A representative of GAP institute claimed it was difficult to see Government’s development
strategy. In her view, the priorities put forward in the proposed CPS were contrary to the
country’s real priorities. Her objection was that the challenge of rule of law was dealt with only
through the strategy of EU integration. She also suggested that there were other alternatives to
promote development besides building a new power plant.
Agenda Item 2: Is the proposed package (of ongoing operations, new lending, analytical
work, and technical assistance) appropriate to address the challenges?
The moderator noted that governance, gender, and education were some of the issues discussed
in the previous session and invited participants to discuss those further. His view was that, while
governance and rule of law was clearly a very big issue for Kosovo, the EU and many other
partners might play a bigger role than the World Bank in that regard. He agreed that gender
should not be just a box in the CPS document and welcomed additional ideas on addressing this
issue.
Mr. Olters highlighted the importance of consultations with all stakeholders in Kosovo, not least
with a view to identifying development priorities with broad-based support. He explained that
every Bank-funded project would need to be ratified by Parliament with a 2/3-majority because
they would be funded with IDA credits and not grants. He also explained the links between the
different Bank-funded projects. For example, the Cadastre and Real Estate project, provided
farmers with titles documenting their land ownership, which, in turn, could enable them to use
land as collateral. The Agriculture project was helping farmers and small agri-businesses with
applications for loans from commercial banks.
One participant questioned the results of several Bank-funded projects such as the Institutional
Development in Education, the Business Environment Technical Assistance, and the Cleanup
and Land Reclamation Projects. He noted that students did not study agriculture, that last year
Kosovo ranked lower in the Doing Business ranking, and that there were protests of area
residents dissatisfied with the Cleanup Project. He praised the Real Estate and Cadastre
41

Registration Project, but expressed concerns that unemployment might not be addressed
sufficiently in the new CPS. The moderator highlighted that creating jobs was a huge challenge
and required a multi-pronged approach to growth and business development.
One participant asked why all World Bank funding needed to be channeled through the
Government and not through CSOs, especially since disbursement was an issue on the side of
government agencies. The moderator noted that the World Bank was owned by the countries of
the world and that it provided financing to the member governments. The lending contracts had
to be between the World Bank and the government, as required by the Bank’s founding charter.
One participant suggested that the education piece in the strategy should be bigger in order to
address fundamental issues and expressed reservations about indebting future generations.
Specifically, she suggested a future education project should aim at making education in Kosovo
aligned with EU standards.
A representative of the Group for Legal and Political Studies suggested that the World Bank
could monitor Government’s budget planning and help competition in the markets, such as the
telecom sector. One participant expressed the opinion that the World Bank would suppress the
market for renewable energy in Kosovo with its proposed support for a new power plant. She
noted that an external expert claimed that 80,000 jobs could be created if the Bank invested in
renewable energy in Kosovo. The moderator suggested that the crux of the discussion on energy
was about how much electricity Kosovo needs and where to get that electricity from. The
moderator explained that Bank officials had reviewed all of the analyses very carefully and
published all of its own analysis in English and Albanian.
One participant disagreed with the Bank’s analysis and noted that the Bank should be held to its
own standards for supporting renewable energy in the future and for making accurate
assessments of the various energy alternatives. The moderator confirmed that the World Bank
would provide many more opportunities to discuss the proposed Kosovo Power Project as it
moved forward with considering the project and conducting all the necessary environmental,
technical, and social assessments.
A representative of KEK workers’ union suggested that the World Bank should focus on
improving energy efficiency and expanding the existing irrigation system in Kosovo.
A representative of IFC informed the participants about the areas where IFC wanted to increase
its program in Kosovo, explaining that IFC had been working on strengthening the
competitiveness of Kosovo’s goods by improving adherence to international standards and
technical cooperation. He noted that IFC was active also in supporting improvements in
corporate governance and trade logistics. He highlighted that IFC’s investment in one leading
commercial bank was very important, as it was the first bank in Kosovo and that IFC is also
working with SMEs. The IFC representative also noted that Kosovo would be included in IFC’s
Balkan Energy Renewable Program which aimed at helping firms to design projects and
financial institutions to develop new products for renewable energy projects.
One participant asked whether the World Bank supported the blockade of Serbian goods to
Kosovo. The moderator responded that the Bank did not support blockades anywhere in the
world because open markets, when managed well, were considered contributors to growth. When
42

a follow-up question was asked about subsidies for Kosovo’s products in relation to Serbian and
Bosnian subsidies, the moderator noted that issues of protection warranted great care.
One participant noted that the figures for GNI coefficient and the birthrate were not recorded in
Kosovo so it was difficult to assess whether improvements had been achieved in the well-being
of the population. He asked if the Bank did any analysis on these figures and if it were to finance
a project supporting improvement of statistics in Kosovo. The Country Manager agreed that
more accurate and more timely statistics were crucial to understanding changes in poverty levels
and agreed that having EU standards in education was very important because it could help with
employment. He underlined that it took a lot of time to achieve these improvements.
Staff from the Bank office in Pristina explained the outcomes of the ongoing education project,
including the decentralization of fiscal management of schools. School development grants
support selected schools to prepare and implement quality enhancement plans. Selection criteria
include retention and attendance rates among girls. There was also support for a training
mechanism for teachers linked to salary increases, which was likely to continue. The project also
strengthened the capacity in the Ministry of Education to improve the assessment of the matura
exam. Links between education and the labor market had been supported through the budget
support operation SEDPO. The Bank official also explained that the project provided
international training on the design of test questions, that the Ministry of Education was building
mechanisms to ensure misconduct was not repeated, and that education institutions would
receive further capacity building. Responding to a comment on politicization of schools in
Kosovo, the Bank official encouraged civil society to devote more attention to the education
sector.
Following the lunch break, staff from the Bank office provided clarifications on the results of the
Environmental Clean-Up Project. The project was ongoing, with the objectives for the ash dump
and overburden dump stabilization having already been achieved. The highest point of the ash
dump had been lowered by 14 meters and its slide towards the village of Dardhishte had been
stopped. Some 100,000 plants have been planted on top of the overburden dumps and, by the end
of May, the current open-air transport of ash should be replaced with a hydraulic transport of ash.
At the end of April, the process of cleaning up tons of phenolic waste water should be
completed. The Government of Kosovo had signed bilateral agreements with countries such as
Sweden and Germany to remove some of the waste.
Agenda Item 3: Is the proposed comprehensive approach to supporting the energy sector
sufficient to address concerns about the Kosovo lignite power plant?
The moderator provided a framework for the discussion by posing a few key questions: how
much electricity did Kosovo need and from where should it get it? How much energy could
Kosovo get from energy efficiency, from renewable energy, and where could it get the rest of the
power needed?
To frame the discussion, Bank staff gave a short presentation and responded to some questions
raised earlier in the day.

43

The importance of affordable and reliable power supply for small businesses was underlined.
The Bank official explained that the Bank’s analysis assumed higher carbon prices than were
demanded in the market and that the forecasted demand used in the Bank’s analysis of Kosovo’s
energy demand was very optimistic. He noted that, even if a smaller supply-demand gap was
used, Kosovo still needed to determine how it was going to secure its energy in the coming
years, particularly as the country was legally obligated to decommission the highly polluting
Kosovo A Power Plant by 2017. The Bank’s analysis was also optimistic about the potential for
renewable sources of energy, such as biogas and wind power. The Bank had been encouraging
the Government to make better use of solar power for water heating. The Bank noted that a
detailed analysis of externalities had not yet been conducted because the project was still in the
earliest stages of consideration. However, this analysis would be done at the stage of Project
Appraisal and consultations would be conducted on its findings .
The Bank also clarified that it would not support the New Kosovo Power Plant if it did not meet
EU standards. The Bank official provided clarifications on the issue of water supply, sharing data
from a technical study on the Iber-Lepenc Canal which concluded that there was sufficient water
for power generation and that the Bank’s water project would help with the conveyance system
and reduction of losses.
The Bank official also responded to an earlier comment about the inclusion of the rehabilitation
of the Kosovo B power plant in the project package, noting that Kosovo’s Parliament had
approved the strategy to combine the closure of Kosovo A, the rehabilitation of Kosovo B, and
the opening of the New Kosovo Power Plant. For as long as the Parliamentary decision allowed
for an economically viable investment and took into consideration all the environmental and
social safeguards, the World Bank would not argue against the current Parliamentary decision.
The Bank official explained that his team and Mr. Daniel Kammen’s team at Berkeley have had
numerous discussions about their respective analyses and that discussions were ongoing. He
noted that running a model on an energy basis versus a capacity basis did not take storage into
account and that a model needed to plan for meeting the peak demand during winter.
A participant disagreed with the findings of the Options Study, mainly because, in his view, peak
consumption was treated in the study as base-load. Another participant warned that the proposed
project would create an energy monopoly which would lobby the government to use more of its
energy rather than promote energy efficiency. The moderator reiterated that, if the project was
not in conformity with EU Directives, the Bank would not finance it, noting that the EU had
confirmed its support for the proposed project and that, as currently planned, it considered the
project to be in conformity with the relevant EU Directives.
Bank officials repeated that the Partial Risk Guarantee for the proposed project had not yet been
approved and that a variety of studies needed to be conducted prior to the Bank’s final
consideration of the project. The moderator noted that it would take at least a year before the
proposed project could be presented to the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors for
further consideration – and then only if the project met all the Bank’s environmental and social
requirements.

44

Bank officials explained that the location of the new power plant would be next to Kosovo B and
would thus not be a green field project, as suggested by representatives from the Municipality of
Obiliq.
A discussion followed about the EU’s rules on monopoly and the right of consumers to choose
their energy supply. A participant objected to the proposed project saying that it breached the
principles of the EU rules on monopoly. Bank officials agreed that Kosovo should have a fully
liberalized, deregulated market but noted that, in other countries, ―switch‖ rates by energy
consumers were very low whereas the investments required to offer the switch were very
expensive. Generally, only the large commercial consumers switched energy providers.
One Bank official noted that new capacity for coal power would not likely crowd out other
renewable investments because Kosovo had a feed-in tariff which meant the operator was
obliged to dispatch renewable energy as a priority. He also noted that the Bank was in favor of
the 400kV transmission line with Albania and that he worked on the proposal for the feasibility
study for this transmission line in 2002/03.
The point was raised by one participant that support from the EU for the proposed power project
was not ensured and that CSOs had sent a letter to the EC asking them to confirm whether they
supported the proposed new Kosovo power plant. He also remarked that the letter of support
from the US Government was signed by a low-ranking Treasury official and not by the State
Secretary. The moderator remarked that EC had told the Bank they supported the project and that
the Bank’s usual interlocutor in the US Government is the Treasury Department.
Questions were raised about the Bank’s Options Study compared with the Berkeley RAEL
alternatives study, as well as about the costs of the proposed power project. Specifically, one
participant asked why the Bank had not modified its numbers on the cost of externalities since its
last presentation and why the Bank was not conducting another externalities study. Bank officials
repeated that the proposed project would not be going to the Board for at least a year. During that
time, the Bank would undertake more detailed analyses about all aspects of the project. For
example, the baseline Environment Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and the Air Quality
Monitoring had not been done but the Government and Bank would prepare these over the next
year. Bank officials noted that the Board will not review the project until all of the ESIAs were
drafted, discussed, and disseminated.
It was also noted that the studies had to be site-specific and could not rely on data from other
countries.
The moderator clarified that the Bank had not approved the project, but rather agreed to consider
―in-principle‖ the Partial Risk Guarantee by launching all the necessary preparatory studies. Ms.
Armitage clarified the purpose of the CPS is to present the broader, long-range vision over the
next four years and that the projects proposed within the CPS would require separate, individual
approval by the Bank’s Board. She explained that when the Board discussed the CPS at the end
of May or early June, it would be looking principally at whether the Bank was proposing the
right kinds of projects in Kosovo in relation to the country’s overarching development
challenges.

45

One participant suggested three points for further discussion: not treating the peak demand as
base-load; working together on decoupling the proposed new power plant and the existing
Kosovo B power plant; and working together on energy efficiency and renewable energy
projects. He agreed that the targets for reduction of losses in the Options Study were ambitious.
The Bank’s energy sector coordinator for Southeast Europe explained that increasing end-use
energy efficiency was difficult because it required awareness and economic support. The
introduction of price signals should be combined with support for the poor. Energy efficiency
required sustained efforts over long periods of time, but very quick results were achievable in the
public sector and by retrofitting public buildings. He noted that this would likely form an
important part of the proposed US$32-million energy efficiency and renewables project to be
supported by the Bank in coming years. Ms. Armitage added that the proposed project would
have subsidies for poor households for insulation, windows, and solar panels. The proposed
project would also have a renewable energy component and the Bank would co-host a donor
conference on energy in the fall of 2012. She underlined that renewable energy and energy
efficiency represented a large part of proposed new lending in the CPS for Kosovo and that the
decisions to include these initiatives in the strategy had been the direct result of feedback
received from the CSOs in attendance. She noted that the proposed water project in the new CPS
also resulted from productive, ongoing discussions with civil society groups and community
members in Kosovo. Ms. Armitage noted that, as the Bank moved forward with these projects,
all of the necessary studies would be shared and consulted with civil society and the community.
The representative of the KEK workers’ union suggested that power plants could provide heating
for the bigger cities in Kosovo and asked again about the Bank’s position on the 8,000
employees of KEK if Kosovo A were closed and Kosovo B and the distribution were ―given
away‖ to private companies. He asked how workers could get involved in the decommissioning
of Kosovo A and what would happen with their property once construction and resettlement took
place. He wanted to know what guarantees would workers have that their livelihoods would not
be risked. A Bank official noted that, based on data from 2009, 50 percent of the KEK
employees were older than the age of 55-58 so they were close to retirement. In Government
documents, investors were required to keep the workers employed for three years on the same or
better terms. After 3 years, they would have to follow the local laws. New construction would
generate direct and indirect employment for the next four years (for 600MW, there would be a
need for 1,000 people for four years). Local skilled workers would be preferred for construction
by the investor. There would be another 300-400 skilled workers in operation and employment
from decommissioning Kosovo A for at least 2-3 years. A combination of age profile, security
from the new investor, and the new jobs that would be needed should compensate well for the
loss of jobs by closing Kosovo A. A more detailed analysis would be done as part of a Poverty
and Social Impact Assessment. The Bank official also explained that cogeneration for district
heating of Pristina would be implemented in the next two years and that it would be connected
with Kosovo B. Ms. Armitage noted that any resettlement needed for the new project would be
handled according to the Bank’s policies.
Agenda Item 4: Are there other areas of emphasis for the Country Partnership Strategy
that have been overlooked? What risks are to be expected and how should the strategy
address these risks?
46

The moderator asked the participants to provide any input they have on the last two guiding
questions – was there anything left out of the CPS and if there was some other risk for the
strategy as a whole besides the risks already identified in the proposed CPS?
One representative asked to see the link between the strategy and the rule of law and suggested
that maybe something on improving the judiciary could be added to the CPS. Another participant
said the Bank was doing more harm than good with the CPS by worsening the health perspective
for the people of Kosovo with the new power plant, by encouraging a monopoly on energy
generation, and spending US$32 million on Technical Assistance and studies. She suggested that
the power plant would be very expensive and Obiliq would lose its village because its citizens’
compensation would happen in such a way that they would be removed from their villages into
apartment blocks. She added that the Bank would fail to compensate the community properly on
resettlement and that, although the Bank would improve water quality, there simply would not be
enough water in Kosovo. She mentioned the risk of the new power project hindering Kosovo’s
EU integration. The moderator remarked that the Bank agreed on the importance of EU
integration for Kosovo. He reiterated that Bank officials did not know yet whether the Partial
Risk Guarantee for the power plant project would be approved by the World Bank Board.
However, he underlined that identifying the country-wide risks was important and that many of
the issues raised regarding the power plant would be discussed in greater detail once some of the
studies were under way.
One participant asked whether the Bank could share details about the US$32 million Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Project. Ms. Armitage noted that the project’s initial concept
documents would be available publically later in the year when and preparation of the project
started. She noted that all project information would be published on the website according to
Bank policies and that she was happy to share with them information on other energy efficiency
projects in the region.
Ms. Armitage noted that the draft CPS document would be shared with the CSOs when it was
sent to the Bank’s Board of Directors because the Government had agreed for simultaneous
disclosure of the CPS. Comments could be sent to Bank staff present in the meeting and to the
Board. Ms. Armitage emphasized that the CPS was a living strategy document, not one set in
stone. This draft document was the Bank’s best assessment at the moment of how it could help
Kosovo to address its development challenges. It was the beginning of a process and the CPS
could be adjusted over the next four years as implementation began through the CPS Progress
Report. The final version of the CPS would incorporate possible comments/changes made by the
Board and be posted on the Bank’s Kosovo website.
The moderator thanked the participants for a very useful discussion. The Country Manager noted
there would be more discussions as preparations on all the projects proposed in the CPS move
forward.
