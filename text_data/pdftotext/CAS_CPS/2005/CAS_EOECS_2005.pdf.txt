Executive S u m m a r y

(i) T h e OECS’ countries are at a critical juncture in their development. Just three decades after
gaining independence, they are struggling to find new sources o f growth and reduce vulnerability, against a
backdrop o f an increasingly competitive global environment; the looming end o f trade preferences; and
dwindling or log-jammed donor resources. These challenges are further compounded by their fiscal
imbalances and high debt ratios and their inherent vulnerability as small island developing states* (SIDS).
Since the last CAS period, economic indicators have deteriorated and all six OECS countries are in the top
fifteen o f the world’s most indebted (relative to GDP) emerging market countries. The impressive social
development gains made over the past 30 years now risk being eroded by the current challenging fiscal and
debt situations and by the economic transformation that may be required to adapt to the changing external
environment. Signs o f the erosion are already emerging in the shape o f rising poverty in both rural and urban
areas, disenfranchised youth and high unemployment, and a corresponding increase in crime. The countries
also face the risk posed by the growing HIViAIDS epidemic in the Caribbean.
(ii) Furthermore, as small states, they face a vulnerability to external shocks, including natural disasters;
limited economic diversification opportunities and high dependence on external trade; high cost o f public

service provision due to diseconomies o f scale; and limited capacity in the public and private sectors. In a
few areas, these diseconomies o f scale and capacity constraints have been successfully overcome through
regional initiatives and projects. Going forward, leveraging regional approaches more aggressively w i l l be
critical to the sub-region’s efforts to revive growth and improve competitiveness and reduce vulnerabilities.
However, a coordinated regional approach by the OECS governments i s often thwarted by differences in their
electoral cycles and b y traditions of national sovereignty.

T h e W o r l d Bank G r o u p Strategy f o r FY06-09

(iii) The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Organization o f Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) proposes a new way o f doing business to help these small states meet the challenges
facing them at this critical stage o f their development. I t s guiding principles are: (a) supporting regional
integration and coordination efforts; (b) partnering and harmonization in both lending and analytical work
with other development partners; and (c) active pursuit o f simplification and capacity building initiatives
tailored to small states.
(iv)
The World Bank Group’s strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY06-09) supports the
sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and strengthening
disaster risk management.
(v)
Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities
w i l l focus, where possible, on using innovative mechanisms to leverage available donor grant financing across
the sub-region. Under Pillar 1, IBRD and IDA support would focus on stimulating growth and
competitiveness by providing technical and financial assistance for public sector modernization and
competitiveness, public utility reform, and s k i l l s enhancement. Analytical and advisory activities to support
Pillar 1 would include policy notes on public sector and public utility reforms, s k i l l s enhancement, investment
climate assessments and an OECS fiduciary assessment. Under Pillar 2, designed to help reduce
vulnerability, the Bank would promote catastrophe risk insurance and environmental management as well as
continue the dialogue on disaster risk mitigation initiatives. It would also support the OECS Governments in
strengthening social protection mechanisms, in particular addressing vulnerable groups such as youth at risk.
Finally, the Bank w i l l continue to support climate adaptation measures and efforts at restoring the ability o f

’

For the purposes o f this CAS, the OECS i s defined to include Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St.
Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, all members o f the World Bank Group. There i s a seventh, full member (Montserrat) and
two associate members (Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands) which are overseas territories o f the United Kingdom. T h i s strategy
supports both national and sub-regional interventions in the six OECS countries across a total landmass no larger than 2,364 sq. km,
with a total population ofjust over half a million (a fifth of the size of Jamaica, and a quarter o f its population).
The World Bank framework of assistance for small states indicates seven areas o f activity related to the four categories-tackling
volatility, vulnerability, and natural disasters; strengthening capacity; meeting challenges and opportunities o f globalization; and
adapting to the changing global trade regime.

natural ecosystems to withstand climate variability effects. Under Pillar 1 and 2, the sub-region w i l l benefit
from Caribbean-wide analytical work on social protection and pension reform; crime, violence and social
exclusion; financial sector and regulation; health financing; and air transport rationalization. Through its
existing portfolio, the Bank w i l l continue to support both Pillars 1 and 2 through interventions in the areas o f
disaster risk management, HIV/AIDS, telecommunications liberalization and education sector reform.
Finally, ongoing technical support and additional technical assistance for improved poverty and social
indicator measurement and monitoring and public finance management i s also envisaged.
(vi)
IFC’s strategy w i l l be to support projects which w i l l enhance the competitiveness o f the OECS
economies helping them meet the challenges o f globalization, especially trade liberalization, focusing on
environmentally sustainable business practices and improving standards o f corporate governance. IFC w i l l
seek to finance and partner with those companies able to diversify the region’s sources o f growth, further
regional economic integration (including with the bigger island economies such as Barbados, Trinidad and
Tobago, and Jamaica), and develop linkages with the smaller locally based island businesses. Some o f the
sectors o f focus entail the financial sector, infrastructure, services (IT, tourism), and the social sectors. Given
the particular issues and constraints faced by island economies (critical mass, collateral), IFC very often
cannot finance stand alone projects. The availability o f grant financing by notably European donors provides
an opportunity to develop some funding mechanism through which donor monies could be used to
share/lower the commercial risk, and thereby facilitate IFC ’s financing. Structuring effective risk sharing
structures w i l l be key to IFC‘s ability to support private sector development in the OECS countries. F C and
the Bank w i l l coordinate their efforts towards developing effective partnerships with the donor community.
(vii)
MIGA’s involvement in the OECS region has primarily been through technical assistance in FDI
attraction and the agency i s scheduled to undertake a benchmarking exercise in FY06 which w i l l focus o n the
investors’ perspective and w i l l give the participating countries a comparative view o f their competitiveness
vis-&vis FDI. MIGA w i l l continue to review requests at the regional or country levels as they arise.

Managing R i s k s
The CAS has three scenarios with different lending volumes and number o f operations. The base case
(IDA only) lending scenario includes operations for a total o f U S $ 51.3 million over 4 years in the lBRD/IDA
blend countries3. The high case lending scenario consists o f US$52.1 million in lBRD only commitments
additional to the base case, bringing the total lending envelope to US$103.4 million. In the low case (IDA
only) scenario, the Bank would support operations for a total o f US$ 3 1.2 million in the IDA blend countries4.
K e y risks are (i)the lack o f sustained OECS Governments’ commitment to restore fiscal and debt
sustainability; (ii)
natural disasters and other exogenous shocks (i.e. oil price and interest rate increases) which
could further exacerbate these countries’ vulnerability; (iii)
limited Governments’ commitment to advance
forcefully o n regional coordination and integration; and (iv) weak project implementation capacity.
(viii)

The CAS program seeks to manage risks through careful selection o f triggers and monitoring o f
(ix)
progress, continued support for disaster risk prevention and mitigation, and a focus on capacity-building at
both the national and regional levels. More emphasis than was given in the past w i l l be committed to
ensuring that Bank-supported interventions are designed to benefit from broad consultative processes
involving civil society and the private sector. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue to pursue outreach efforts to
civil society to encourage an understanding o f the development challenges facing the sub-region and to build
consensus around needed reforms.
By virtue of the small states exception, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are IBRD/IDA blend
countries even though their incomes are well above the IDA cutoff. For them, the IDNIBRD lending ratio has traditionally been set at
5050. St. Kitts and Nevis has graduated to IBRD-only status since its per capita income i s above US$6,000. Antigua and Barbuda,
with a per capita income o f over US$9,000, has never borrowed from the Bank Group, but has expressed an interest in doing so.
T h i s includes US$ 15.2 mn from the Regional IDA allocation.

THE ORGANIZATION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

I.Overview
1.
The six members o f the OECS are similar in size, climate, topography and history. They also face a
number o f common challenges. First, they are all seeking new sources o f growth and a way to reduce
vulnerability, against a backdrop o f an increasingly competitive global environment; the looming end o f trade
preferences; and dwindling or log-jammed donor resources. Second, they all face fiscal imbalances and high
debt ratios, compounded by their inherent vulnerability as small island developing states. Finally, the
impressive social development gains made over the past 30 years now risk being eroded by the current
challenging fiscal and debt situations and by the economic transformation that may be required to adapt to the
changing external environment.
2.
Despite their similarities, the OECS countries remain distinct in many ways. In tourism--a fiercely
competitive sector, which accounts for almost 75 percent o f their collective GDP--while they share a common
“Eastern Caribbean destination”, they also exploit their distinct features5. And in the agriculture sector-historically important, but whose production has been halved as a share o f GDP over the last twenty years--St.
Kitts and Nevis has grown sugar6;three others (Dominica, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) grow
bananas, while Grenada, until the recent events o f Hurricane Ivan, had marketed itself successfully as the
“spice island”, second only to Indonesia in global nutmeg production.

3.
These multi-faceted challenges require the World Bank Group to design i t s assistance strategy in a
way that reflects both the national and the sub-regional development needs o f these countries. This document
i s organized as follows: The first section presents an overview o f the sub-region’s political, economic and
social context, and discusses some key development challenges. ‘The second section presents the OECS
Development Charter and progress to date on i t s implementation, including moves towards greater regional
integration, The third section reviews the lessons learned from previous Bank involvement in the OECS and
presents a strategy for the next four years. The fourth section highlights how the Bank would manage risks
under the CAS.

11. The Country Context
The Political Context
4.
Characterized by political stability, the OECS countries boast open democracies, with strong (over 80
percent) participation in elections. They have retained Westminster-style Parliamentary government systems
which have not evolved or been modernized since their establishment, leading to civil services which are
large, bureaucratic and burdensome to their small economies. All but one o f the OECS Prime Ministers hail
from strong labour party roots. O f the six Heads o f Governments, one has recently been elected (Antigua and
Barbuda), three have recently been returned to office (Grenada in 2003, St. Kitts and Nevis in 2004, and
Dominica in 2005) and two (St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) will seek re-election in the next
eighteen months. In March o f 2004, following 40 years o f the Bird dynasty, and its associated ruinous fiscal
management and poor transparency7,Baldwin Spencer was elected as Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister
with a resounding majority. St. Kitts and Nevis recently returned the Prime Minister, Denzil Douglas, to
power and in Grenada, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell--the lone centrist--returned to office for a second term
with a reduced one-seat majority in Parliament. In Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit was returned to office, adding
two seats (giving him 12 out o f 20) to h i s Labour Party’s majority Elections must be called in both St. Vincent
and the Grenadines and St. Lucia by 2007. All o f the Prime Ministers, with the exception o f Antigua and
Barbuda and Grenada, are also the Finance Ministers.
In the tourism sector, for example, the islands o f St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica do not have runways that can
accommodate large jets, but they boast yachting and eco-tourism respectively as their own niche markets. Similarly, some islands
cater to predominantly British markets (Grenada), others to the US (St. Kitts and Nevis) while others cater to both (St. Lucia).
St. Kitts and Nevis has recently announced its last sugar crop w i l l be harvested in July 2005.
During the 198Os, a series of large public investments, surrounded by governance issues, tumed out to be unproductive. Allegations
of money laundering and proven misuse o f the medical insurance scheme have also contributed to the country’s debt: GDP estimated
at 142 percent in 2003.

’

1

5.
The Prime Ministers are committed to the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM)
and the move towards a broader single market and economy under the Caribbean Single Market and Economy
(CSME)*. Following a protracted period o f weak leadership at the OECS Secretariat’, the new DirectorGeneral has sought to revitalize i t s mission and has support from the OECS Heads for moving forward with
regional initiatives, Funding for the secretariat has, however, been sporadic and the OECS authority has not
managed to match i t s political commitment with much-needed financial support. The Secretariat i s mandated
to implement the sub-region’s Development Charter while the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) has
taken the lead o n initiatives supporting an OECS economic union.
6.
Over the past year, the Governments’ commitment to confronting their economic problems has
strengthened. They now openly recognize that the current economic situation i s unsustainable and have
started to take steps to address the challenges facing them. Spurred by the fiscal crisis in Dominica, the
administration change in Antigua and Barbuda and the devastation caused by Hurricane Ivan in Grenada, and
against a backdrop o f diminishing agricultural trade preferences and an increasingly competitive global
environment, the OECS Prime Ministers are interested in exploring new options to revive growth and deal
with their debt situations. However, many o f them have yet to build the required consensus to implement
bold adjustment programs and to date only limited public consultations have taken place. The OECS
populace expects high living standards because o f the “demonstration effect” exerted by their strong ties to
North America through tourism and migration. Meeting those expectations entails significant pressure on
incumbent governments, and opposition parties are quick to seize o n any potential signals that difficult
adjustment may be needed. The situation i s further exacerbated by the differences in electoral cycles which
makes collective regional positioning challenging. Creating ownership for change will, therefore, require
significant outreach efforts to civil society to inform them and consult on existing challenges and options for
addressing them.

T h e Social Context
7.
Social indicators for the OECS countries are strong and almost all o f the major Millennium
Development Goals have been met. Primary education net enrollment ratios, for example, are high, between
84 and 100, and infant mortality rates are low, ranging from 14 to 22 per 1,000, Dramatic progress in access
to improved water source and sanitation has also taken place over the last ten years’O. L i f e expectancy, ranges
from 71 to 77 years, comparable to most OECD countries.

8.
However, despite the achievements attained over the past three decades, these social gains risk being
eroded by four key factors. First, the current challenging fiscal and debt situation has made current levels o f
spending in critical sectors such as education and health no longer affordable and points to the need for urgent
reforms to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Second, weak educational attainment and a limited
curriculum are having a stifling effect on growth and competitiveness and contributing to rising
unemployment among youth. Third, low population growth rates o f less than 0.3 percent and an increasingly
older population (which lead to an increasing elderly dependency rate) w i l l require a reorientation o f both the
health and education sectors to reflect this demographic shift. Finally, the high and growing prevalence o f the
H N / A I D S epidemic in the Caribbean, if not addressed, would reverse gains in the health indicators and have
grave consequences for overall growth and development in the OECS countries.
Poverty. Notwithstanding their status as Upper Middle Income Countries (with GNIs per capita
9.
ranging from US$3,650 in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica to US$9,950 in Antigua and
Barbuda), and a dearth o f reliable time-series data, poverty in the OECS appears to be increasing and the gap
between rich and poor widening. Income inequality in the sub region i s also wonyingly high, w i t h Gini
coefficients ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5. While poverty i s increasing predominantly in rural areas,
migration to urban communities in search o f employment i s also contributing to a rise in the number o f poor
people in towns and cities. On average, although data sources are weak and not easily comparable, i t i s

*

I n 1989, the CARICOM Treaty was amended to establish the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME). Nine new Protocols
were introduced with the objective o f achieving free trade in goods and services, free movement o f capital and people, coordination o f
foreign exchange and interest rate policies, tax regimes, laws and common currency, among other things.
The OECS Secretariat i s the sub-regional institution mandated to identify scope for joint or coordinated action towards the economic
and social advancement o f the OECS member states.
loOther than Dominica, the other countries recorded access to piped water by well over 90 percent o f households; considerable
improvement in the level of sanitation ranging from 50 to 96 percent across Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines. The increase i n access to improved sanitation in Dominica and St. Lucia was 10 and 15 percent respectively, to
45 and 52 percent.

estimated that across the OECS, a third o f the population i s below the national poverty lines. And o f the total
poor households in the sub region, about a third are said to be living in extreme poverty, while the remaining
two thirds are unable to achieve satisfactory incomes due to l o w human capital andor the economic
environment. Finally, high unemployment (25 percent in Dominica, 13 percent in Grenada, 19 percent in St.
Lucia and 21 percent in St. Vincent and the Grenadines) i s also impeding development (see Table 1). Young
people, between the ages of 15 and 24, are over-represented among the poor and unemployed, driving many
to a life o f crime and drugs.

Health. Health Ministries across the sub-region are grappling with a number o f common issues-14.
reflective o f their small size, dispersed populations and changing demographics--and are seeking ways to
deliver health services more efficiently. The OECS countries are struggling to address issues in two key
areas: (1) the wage bill, which accounts for between 60 and 80 percent o f health expenditures, resulting in
insufficient investment in infrastructure and equipment, and (2)the issue o f s k i l l s deficiencies due to the
migration o f nurses which has resulted in poor facilities and weak provision o f specialist services:

15.
The benefits o f regional approaches to common challenges are perhaps nowhere better illustrated than
in the health sector. The establishment o f the OECS Pharmaceutical Procurement Service, as a sub-agency o f
the OECS Secretariat, lowered the cost o f pharmaceuticals across the sub-region by around 40 percent. There
i s scope to expand this type o f “collective approach” within the sector in areas such as purchasing supplies,
laboratory services and specialized health service delivery through regional arrangements, and into other
sectors, such as the procurement o f textbooks. Another pressing reason for extensive reforms within the
OECS health sectors i s the demographic and epidemiological transition. The reduction in mortality due to
communicable diseases, the rise in l i f e expectancy and the fall in fertility rates w i l l have drastic implications
for the provision o f health care over the next de~ade’~.
Non-communicable diseases and chronic conditions
such as hypertension, diabetes, strokes and coronary heart disease w i l l be the health challenges o f an aging
population and health sectors w i l l need to make adjustments in their strategies to reflect these changes.

HIV/AIDS. The World Health Organization estimates the overall HIV/AIDS prevalence in the
16.
Caribbean to be second to Sub-Saharan Africa. Inthe OECS, the prevalence i s estimated to be approaching 1
percent o f the OECS population compared to 7.5 percent average for Sub-Saharan Africa. In small islands
like those o f the OECS, such an HIV prevalence rate can rapidly affect the country’s development prospects.
Furthermore, uncontrolled spread o f the disease in a single country threatens the success to control the
epidemic in the wider Caribbean region because o f the populations’ high mobility among islands. This i s
particularly the case in the OECS, where, notwithstanding public information efforts, the epidemic continues
to spread from high-risk groups to the general population. Furthermore, detection and treatment are stymied
by under-reporting, an ongoing stigma attached to those infected with HIV/AIDS and continued r i s k y
behavior among vulnerable groups such as youth.
17.
The leaders o f the OECS sub-region have identified the fight against HIV/AIDS as critical to the subregion’s long-term economic growth and human development. For i t s part, the donor community, including
the Bank-through four projects under the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Adaptable Program Lending (APL) in
Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines-has rallied to support the OECS
islands in their efforts to curb the spread o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic through increasing awareness o f risks,
promoting behavioral change, strengthening treatment and care; and, development o f a sustainable
organizational and institutional framework for addressing the epidemic over the longer term. The complex,
multi-dimensional nature o f HIV/ATDS strategies w i l l demand strengthened institutional capacity and a
framework that allows cooperation across sectors. Effective approaches to the HIVIAIDS challenge in the
Caribbean w i l l also require better coordination among the various donors and other agencies so that the region
can benefit from an overall strategic approach to the epidemic. Given the debt situation facing the OECS,
grant resources should be leveraged where possible.

18.
Social Protection. The OECS countries face a number o f important socio-economic risks. The high
levels o f income and consumption volatility, due to an array o f extemal economic shocks, natural disasters
and domestic policy-induced shocks, have translated into equally high levels o f vulnerability among
individuals, households and communities. These manifest themselves as chronic and transient poverty, weak
human capital development, j o b or income loss, persistent unemployment, and income insecurity in old age.
Poor families and youth find themselves particularly vulnerable, and with relatively few risk management
tools at their disposal.
19.
All the OECS countries implement a range o f programs - both social insurance and social assistance
- t o mitigate these risks, but a number o f structural challenges hamper their impact, including: (i)
overlapping
and uncoordinated programs; (ii)
weak targeting; (iii)
inadequate or nonexistent M I S systems; and (iv) weak
implementation capacity. Social insurance (Le., social security) programs that provide health insurance and
old-age security, among other things, also confront important structural challenges. A vast majority o f the
l3In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, for example, the share o f the population under 20 years old i s projected to decline from 42
percent o f the total i n 2000 to 25 percent i n 2025, while the share of the population 60 years old and over i s projected to double.

poor and informal sector workers remain uncovered; moreover, if unreformed, some o f these programs face
insolvency in the long-run due to the rapid aging o f local populations. A Social Protection Strategy Paper for
the Caribbean i s laying the ground work for a more strategic approach to social protection reform in the
OECS that includes improved coordination among donors as well as exploitation o f cross-country synergies.
Increasingly out o f school and out o f work, youth at risk are also emerging as a significant challenge and
Governments have expressed the urgent need for interventions that are remedial as well as preventive. An
increase in, among other things, HIV/AIDS incidence; teenage pregnancies; high school drop out rates; and
antisocial behaviors often resulting in crime have been directly linked to this segment o f the population.

Education. Although all the countries achieved universal primary enrollment and completion in
20.
2000 (the latter with the exception o f St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which i s expected to attain this within
the next year), and rapid increases in secondary school enrollment rates are underway (see Table 2),
completion rates are lagging, and the quality o f education remains a major issue. The OECS education sectors
are ~ e l l - f u n d e d 'but
~ poorly managed and the outputs do not reflect the considerable public resources
dedicated to them. If the OECS countries fail to change some o f the fundamentals (curriculum content,
teacher training and equitable access), the gains made in the primary sector over the last decade w i l l become
irrelevant as a new generation o f young people graduates from secondary school or college with s k i l l s that are
not competitive in a new global economy.

Poor education outcomes in the context o f high public spending indicate serious inefficiencies in the
education systems. L o w pupil: teacher ratios, inefficient teacher deployment and scant pre-service trainingI5
have combined to raise the personnel costs while constraining the number o f trained teachers in classrooms
across the region. One outcome o f the low quality and inequitable access to secondary education in the OECS
i s high youth unemploymenti6. In addition, disincentives to complete high school --such as curricula which
are perceived as irrelevant often being taught by unqualified teachers, and schools which condone corporal
punishment--are a key contributing factors to a rise in risky youth behavior and social exclusion, particularly
among boys.

The OECS also has a serious shortfall in post-secondary attainment, due in great part to the poor
22.
quality o f secondary education and an inadequate provision o f tertiary education. However, as the following
section indicates, a significant share o f tertiary graduates migrate abroad with a resulting loss to the public of
returns from this public investment. Increasing non-governmental financing in tertiary education while
ensuring access to low-income students through scholarships and student loans are hndamental changes
needed to increase enrollment and equity in the hture.
23.
Migration and Skills Retention. Five o f the six OECS countries rank high among the top 20
countries in the world with the highest migration rates”. Four o f the countries also rank among those with the
highest remittances per capita.” These migration and remittance flows are significant and play an important
role, given the small population size and the inherent susceptibility o f small states. There are three broad
categories o f migrants - those who migrate within the OECS, those who migrate within the Caribbean region
and those who migrate to OECD countries - mainly the US, Canada and the UK. Extra-regionally, i t has been
estimated that the OECS community abroad numbers 200,000 people or about 35 percent o f the population.
From the data available, the majority o f those migrating are skilled and post-secondary educated workers,
many o f whom are joined later by their families (more than one-third o f the residencies granted in the U S are,
for instance, under the guise o f family sponsorship), contributing to a “brain drain” across the sub-region.
This departure o f educated migrants has two impacts: (1) a social dislocation among families and
communities and (2) a reduction in productivity in specific sectors o f the economy creating labor gaps,
particularly in the public sector --where capacity i s weak--and the entrepreneurial class. OECS Governments
are increasingly encouraging return migration as an important source o f skills, expertise and ideas (Le. brain
gain, circulation or exchange) to be drawn on for national and regional development.

In the OECS, remittances have made a healthy contribution to GDP, from almost 11 percent in
24.
Grenada to 3 percent in Antigua and Barbuda, with an average o f around 5 percent across the region, On the
positive side, they represent an important element o f the safety net for the poor and ~nemployed.’~O n the
negative side, remittances have been shown to raise voluntary unemployment and to increase the average
wage in the economy to the detriment o f competitiveness. More importantly, i t i s unclear whether remittances
can compensate in the long-term for the public investment foregone by governments. A key challenge w i l l be
to find innovative ways to capture a higher return on public investment in education.

The Economic context
25.
Recent Macroeconomic Performance. The OECS countries, as members o f the Eastem Caribbean
Currency Union (ECCU), share a common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), and a
common currency, with three independent territories (Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands),
The Eastem Caribbean (EC) dollar has been pegged to the U S dollar since 1976 at EC$2.7 per U S $ l . The
commitment to a fixed exchange rate and a prudent monetary policy under the ECCU umbrella has been a key
element in maintaining inflation rates close to international levels.

The OECS countries experienced a relatively strong decade o f real GDP growth in the 1980s (5.9
26.
percent per year) driven mainly by tourism and banana exports, and public investment financed primarily by
development assistance. This was followed by a steady decline in real GDP growth since the mid 1990s (3.3

percent per year). Initially, this decline was largely caused by a sharp reduction in productivity growth
associated with s h i f t s in the composition o f investment, weakening performance in the export sector,
competitive pressures from lower-priced tourist destinations and a growing inward orientation o f the private
sector. This trend was exacerbated in the early 2000s by many negative external shocks (natural disasters, the
9/11 events, the slowdown in the global economy, o i l price increases and eroding trade preferences). The
OECS Governments tried to offset the slowdown and sustain employment as well as meet natural disasterrelated costs through an expansionary fiscal policy, mainly through increased public investments financed by
expensive commercial borrowing (both external and domestic). This created persistent fiscal deficits and
boosted public sector debt to some o f the highest levels in the world. Infour countries (Antigua and Barbuda,
Dominica, Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis) existing debt levels are at or in excess o f 100 percent o f GDP.
The large fiscal and debt imbalances are now further dampening growth and private investment. The lack o f
an enforceable fiscal discipline mechanism in the currency board arrangement and the easy access to external
credit from commercial banks outside the sub-region contributed to weakened fiscal discipline. In effect, the
cost o f fiscal slippage, in the form o f future inflation, higher interest costs or pressure on the currency board,
are being shared with the other OECS Governments or deferred to the future.

27.
Macroeconomic performance in the OECS countries improved in 2003 and 2004. Driven by a rapid
expansion in tourism in most countries following the 9/11 slowdown, real GDP growth was 3.4 and 3.2
percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively, despite an active hurricane season in the second half o f 2004. The
aggregate OECS fiscal balance improved from -10.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to an estimated -5.6 and -4.9
percent in 2003 and 2004*O, on account o f strengthened revenue administration, enhanced expenditure controls
and some reduction in capital spending. The improved fiscal performance and renewed growth have not been
sufficient, however, to steer public debt to GDP ratios on a downward path (with an OECS average o f 106
percent o f GDP at end - 2004).
28.
Driven by the continued growth in the U S and UK (the sub-region’s main tourism markets), real GDP
growth i s projected at 3.2 percent in 2005. While key actions are underway in several OECS highly indebted
countries to address the fiscal imbalances, the pace o f fiscal consolidation should be accelerated to place debt
on a clearly downward path, notably by broadening the tax base, including through the introduction o f a
broad-based consumption tax (or VAT), streamlining expenditures and strengthening fiscal institutions. Also,
restoring medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability in the OECS countries w i l l require comprehensive

adjustment policies. I t i s unlikely that in the highly indebted countries debt can be brought down purely
through fiscal adjustment, so a multi-pronged approach, incorporating sustained fiscal adjustment, growthenhancing structural reforms, improved debt management, and possible debt restructuring i s needed.
29.
In Dominica, the Government i s already implementing such a strategy with the coordinated financial
and technical support from the IMF under a PRGF-supported program, the World Bank and other donors.
Progress in fiscal consolidation i s expected to continue in those countries that held elections in 2004. Antigua
and Barbuda has announced an ambitious fiscal reform agenda including the reintroduction o f a personal
income tax and civil service retrenchment; in Grenada progress i s being made in designing and implementing
reconstruction and macroeconomic stabilization measures; and St. Kitts and Nevis has announced the closure
o f the state-owned sugar company which w i l l ease fiscal pressure and release valuable resources for private
sector growth. Three o f the four OECS countries with public sector debt to GDP ratios at or in excess o f 100
percent o f GDP (Dominica, Grenada, and Antigua and Barbuda) have adopted a more forceful debt strategy in
an attempt to bring down their high debt levels and are currently pursuing debt restructuring agreements with
creditors. The exception i s St. Kitts and Nevis where the authorities anticipate proceeds over the next few
years from the disposition o f assets (including land) o f the sugar state-owned company.
30.
Prospects for fiscal consolidation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia (the two countries
w i t h lower public debts) w i l l be influenced by electoral cycles (with both countries expected to hold elections
no later than 2006); in these countries, the approved budgets suggest easing o f fiscal stances, including a
significant expansion in public sector investment and with the authorities targeting reduction in the debt levels
only over the medium-term. While this approach has risks in view o f the high vulnerability o f these
economies to extemal shocks, the political leaders feel that a swifter approach may not be politically or
socially acceptable (see Annexes 4-9 for country details).

Growth and Competitiveness. A secular slowdown in growth, a radical transformation o f the
31.
extemal environment and debt and fiscal imbalances have combined to create an imperative for strengthening
the OECS strategy for growth and competitiveness. A Bank report recently completed at the request o f the
OECS countries2’ presents an overarching strategic framework for growth and competitiveness that could
serve to guide the various efforts o f the national and regional authorities, the private sector and development
partners to define and implement a strategy to stimulate growth and improve competitiveness. The report
highlights the importance for the OECS countries individually and as a group to formulate a strategic vision
for the OECS economies and key sectors reflecting the changing global environment and capitalizing on the
sub-region’s competitive advantages.

This strategy would need to include a number o f growth-enhancing interventions: (i)
streamlining and
refocusing the role o f government through accelerated fiscal adjustment and public sector modernization; (ii)
expansion o f the s k i l l s base and promotion o f innovation and technology adoption; (iii)
a reduction in the key
constraints to doing business; (iv) the reduction o f inward orientation and expansion o f external market
space;22 and (v) rapid implementation o f free movement o f labor within the OECS and CSME and use o f
international standards and certifications. Such interventions would support the development o f emerging
possible new sources o f growth such as offshore education, health and wellness tourism and high-end ICT. In
order to bring such an agenda to fruition, a concerted effort on the part o f the OECS governments, the subregional institutions, the private sector and civil society w i l l be required, as well as sustained support from
their development partners, over a medium term horizon. Given the limited capacity o f the OECS public
sectors to address these multiple challenges, the report proposes a number o f priority actions that can be
addressed over the short- to medium-term:
0

0

Restoring fiscal and debt sustainability and improving the efficiency o f public administration. In
addition to improved debt management, efforts are needed to: refocus and improve the strategic
planning o f public investment programs and improve public procurement; reform public sector wage
mechanisms to align wage increases with productivity improvements; reform the tax regime,
including rolling out the VAT, removing non-tariff barriers to trade and reducing the use o f
investment incentives and discretionary tax concessions, to level the playing field for businesses; and
refocus the role o f the public sector in the management o f the economy, in particular by reducing
unnecessary layers o f approvals and discretion in the administration o f regulations, permits and
license administration;
raising the s k i l l s base by: reforming teacher training and deployment schemes; accelerating
curriculum reform in schools and training institutions; and strengthening the quality o f primary and
secondary education delivery;
improving the business environment through: addressing monopoly pricing in remaining telecom
segments; improving oversight o f electricity utilities to reduce costs; formulating and implementing
an air transport competition policy; reforming petroleum pricing mechanisms; updating tourism
strategies to target new market segments and strengthening investment and tourism promotion, while
protecting the natural environment on which tourism i s based; and
establishing and adopting r i s k mitigation measures to offset the effects o f natural disasters, to which
the small states are particularly vulnerable.

Financial Sector. In the OECS, the financial sector i s relatively deep and has achieved an impressive
33.
reach, providing access to some formal financial services for a very large share o f the population. W h i l e
banks are generally highly liquid and capital adequacy levels have remained stable, a 2003 joint Bank-IMF
FSAP highlighted a number o f emerging risks. In addition to the concentration o f asset portfolios, in
particular large exposures to the public sector and mortgage market, these include: (i)
weaknesses in the
regulatory and supervisory framework for bank supervision relative to the requirements o f the Base1 Core
Principles, including lack o f enforcement capacity; (ii)
weaknesses in follow-up actions, as well as inadequate
frequency o f on-site inspections; and (iii)
a substantial share o f non-performing loans in Antigua and Barbuda
(21 percent), Dominica (47 percent) and St. Lucia (24 percent).
34.
Perhaps most important among the emerging risks are those associated with the fiscal pressures in the
region. Several indigenous banks are highly exposed to their local public sector, and the rapid build-up in
government borrowing in some jurisdictions, combined with sizable domestic arrears by these governments,
raises a key concern that, if the current situation continues or deteriorates, the central bank may be called upon
to meet a liquidity need attributable, directly or indirectly, to government arrears. Such support could pose a
threat to the credibility o f the currency peg that i s the basis o f the stability in the ECCU.
35.
The role o f the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in the development o f the financial sector
has been considerable. I t has placed itself at the service o f the OECS governments in energetically and
imaginatively promoting three interlinked prongs o f financial sector policy: (i)maintenance o f monetary
stability; (ii)
protection o f the safety and soundness o f the banking institutions; and (iii)
market development.

*’Through strengthened participation in the CSME and FTAA negotiations (notably by pushing for critical market access to facilitate

service exports), tax reform to make fiscal space for a reduction in trade taxes, phased out exceptions within the Common Extemal
Tariff, elimination o f non-trade barriers and reform o f duty concessions.

10

Each o f these contributes to financial stability and each i s also needed for increasing the contribution o f
finance to growth. Emerging risks to the ECCU now call for a renewed effort on the part o f the ECCB to take
a more forthright role in protecting the soundness o f the OECS financial system as a whole. This effort w i l l
require a refocusing o f i t s resources. So far, there has been limited progress in financial sector reform. The
ECCB has revised i t s prudential guidelines on capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and corporate
governance standards in line with some o f the recommendations o f the recently completed FSAP. However,
revisions to the Uniform Banking Act that was approved by the ECCB’s Monetary Council in 2004 have not
been enacted by the OECS countries, and the ECCB Agreement Act has not yet been amended to enhance the
ECCB’s supervisory powers. While some countries have strengthened the supervision o f the offshore sector,
there are currently n o plans to align the prudential regimes o f offshore banks with the Uniform Banking Act,
as recommended in the FSAP.
36.
Access to financing remains a constraint for the OECS economies, especially for Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises, (MSMEs,). Issues include: (i)
undercapitalized companies; (ii)
short term instruments
used to fund long-term needs; (iii)
lack o f risk capital (equity and quasi-equity instruments); (iv) limited
structuring expertise; and (v) underdeveloped financial markets with virtually no products other than
traditional banking products. O f particular concern for MSMEs i s the application o f conservative standards for
credit screening such as preference towards successful business establishments and over collateralization.
Although there has been some progress in the past couple o f years, the OECS financial markets need further
integration and modernization to efficiently mobilize funds from larger economies such as Trinidad and
Tobago, Jamaica, and Barbados.

37.
The OECS countries have encouraged the growth o f their financial sectors to diversify away from
traditional agricultural activities in order to limit the economic impact o f natural disasters. In the past,
initiatives undertaken b y the OECS countries to promote the financial sector with limited regulatory oversight
have led to a growth in offshore financial intermediation and with i t attracted flows o f legitimate and
potentially illegitimate capital. The geographic location o f the OECS countries makes them a strategic transshipment point for illicit drugs flowing between South America and the United States and Europe.
38.
Financial regulatory policies within the OECS countries during the 1990s raised international money
laundering concerns that are being addressed. The United States Treasury Department issued an advisory
against Antigua and Barbuda in 1999 because o f concerns over the country’s regulation o f the offshore
financial sector. Between 2000 and 2001, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)
identified Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
as Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories (NCCT) in the fight against money laundering. FATF did not l i s t
St. Lucia as an NCCT. In light of the international pressure, each OECS country has taken important steps to
build anti-money laundering and combating the financing o f terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes in accordance
with international standards. The OECS countries have enacted or have taken steps to enact AML and CFT
legislation, tightened regulatory controls on the financial sector, especially the offshore sector and established
financial intelligence units to combat money laundering among other measures. Some o f the OECS countries
have had money laundering prosecutions. In recognition o f these measures, the United States withdrew i t s
advisory on Antigua and Barbuda in 2001 and by 2003 the FATF had removed all o f the OECS countries on
i t s NCCT list. The OECS countries continue to take steps to enhance their programs to combat money
laundering. Challenges remain in implementing AML measures and adopting comprehensive CFT regimes.
39.
The World Bank’s Financial Market Integrity Office (FSEFI) has worked with the OECS countries to
support their AML/CFT efforts in numerous ways. FSEFI stands ready to provide additional technical
assistance as needed.
Infrastructure. The infrastructure challenge for the OECS countries i s not one o f access but rather
40.
one o f performance in service delivery, particularly in terms o f affordability and financial sustainability .
Reflecting government policies that have put services high o n the political agenda, the OECS countries have
been successful in increasing access to electricity and water.

41,
Electrification rates exceed 95 percent and access to water i s generally reported to be higher than
access to electricity. (Sewage networks, however, are less extensive than water supply networks, and
wastewater i s often inadequately treated prior to discharge, which has detrimental effects on both health and
the environment).
42.
Notwithstanding these high rates o f access, discrepancies remain, with electricity tariffs, for example,
in St. Kitts, St. Lucia significantly below those in Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua and

11

Barbuda, Nevis, and Dominicaz3. This can be explained, at least in part, by differences in policies and
institutions, that is, b y decisions on issues such as regulation, private or public operation and the extent o f
competition in service provision, and regulation design. There i s a strong positive correlation between
measures o f institutional capacity and measures o f infrastructure performance.

Telecommunications and Utilities. The successful liberalization o f the telecommunications subsector has arguably been the success story in infra~tructure2~~
implemented with the assistance o f the World
Bank. This was accomplished through the establishment o f the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL), a regional regulatory agency--which i s being further strengthened under a follow-on
FY05 operation and legal and regulatory reforms in the sector. Similar regional regulatory approaches, which
promote effective regulation despite limited national capacity constraints, could be adapted with positive
results to the water and electricity sectors.

43,

44.
In electricity, several Eastern Caribbean utilities, both public and private, have little in the way o f
regulatory incentives to optimize their capacity planning, fuel choices, procurement, and other cost drivers.
This contrasts with Barbados and Jamaica, where regulatory agencies effectively supervise the utilities
providing incentives for increased efficiency and improved service. Private ownership o f utilities can also
help increase efficiency if the profit motive can be used to provide incentives to minimize costs. The OECS
entities could consider establishing a regional regulator similar to ECTEL to exert additional pressure for
efficiency on electricity companies that are not currently subject to regulatory oversight. It seems unlikely
that any country in the OECS possesses the scale and diversity in electricity generation to benefit from a
competitive power market. A better model may be to subject the incumbent utilities' generation-capacity
expansion plans to public and regulatory scrutiny, and to require them to purchase power from independent
providers in cases where it can be shown to lower total system costs. This approach could result in lower
tariffs and increased opportunities for co-generation and use o f renewable resources. Recognizing the
importance o f improving the regulatory environment, Dominica i s actively pursuing an electricity sector
reform program with World Bank assistance.
45.
Water in the Caribbean, which i s provided through government owned and operated water service
providers, i s an inherently political issue, and reforms that recognize this fact may ultimately be the ones that
become sustainable.
46.
Water delivery i s also the worst performing o f the OECS utility sectors and i s characterized by i t s
inefficient operation, tariffs which are often too low to recover costs, overstaffing and an inability to attract
finance for new investment to improve and extend services. A number o f solutions have been proposed: (i)
Private participation through operating (lease/affermage)- type contracts that give private f i r m s true
management control; require them to meet defined targets; and lock-in well-designed tariff and subsidy
regimes; (ii)Explicit, targeted subsidies paid for provision o f outputs, to address social concerns in water
pricing, and to expand access; (iii)Development agency finance o f capital expenditure, either directly, or
through loans to establish subsidy funds; (iv) Government responsibility for financing some or all
investments, either directly or through paying o f output-based subsidies to expand service; and (v)
Performance-based contracts for defined elements o f the service, such as meter reading, billing and
collections. It i s also worth noting that coastal infrastructure i s particularly vulnerable to climate change
impacts (rise in sea level, increased climate variability) and that the anticipated impacts in saline intrusion of
acquifers caused by sea level rise, w i l l further tax the ability to supply freshwater.

47.
Transportation. Overall, there i s scope for significantly improving the reach and quality of the
transport sector within the OECS. Shipping capacity i s adequate and i s privately provided in a competitive
market. Air transport, however, continues to frustrate the scope for growth and competitiveness and policy
changes could significantly increase the quality o f service and reduce costs. Other issues that require attention
include: (i)
improving safety standards to comply with international requirements; and (ii)

capacity at airports. Roads in the OECS are poorly constructed and represent a significant drain on
government budgets, due to a disinclination by the private sector to be involved. This has led to a network

The increase in network capacity and competition among operators has caused prices to drop for most services. Average prices for

that i s congested, unsafe and which challenges the efficient transportation o f goods (such as produce) and the
services (such as tourism). Road construction and maintenance practices seem to be particularly poor in the
Caribbean.
48.
The greatest gain to international transport in the region would come through rapid liberalization o f
air services and the eventual phase-out o f government support for national and regional carriers. The main
barrier to liberalization i s the desire on the part o f regional governments to protect regional flag carriers, such
as LIAT, which, in their current form, are arguably financial liabilities and not assets. However, governments
are rightly concerned about their ability to ensure reliable and adequate air services, and worry that a purely
market-based approach could be too r i s k y . This concern could be addressed by asking airlines to bid on nonexclusive contracts, under which they would commit to provide specific capacities and schedules on key
routes in exchange for a subsidy. Competitively awarding such contracts would assure governments that
services would be provided while simultaneously engaging lower and more transparent subsidies than the
alternative o f supporting national and regional carriers.

The Environmental Context
49.
Vulnerability to Natural Disasters. The OECS countries are among the most disaster-prone in the
world, by measures such as frequency, population affected, and value o f damage. A joint Commonwealth
Secretariaworld Bank Task Force on Small States study which compiled a composite vulnerability index
places four o f the OECS countries in the top 20 (out o f 111 developing countries, which includes all small
states) with the remaining two closely behind in the top thirty.

50.
Based on the experience since 1970, a large natural disaster, inflicting damage equivalent to more
than 2 percent o f the affected country’s GDP, can be expected to hit the region roughly every 2.5 years. The
short and medium-term impacts o f natural disasters include (i)
an immediate contraction in economic output;
(ii)
a worsening o f external balances; (iii)
a deterioration in fiscal balances; and (iv) an increase in poverty.
The long-term impacts may include (i)
environmental degradation; (ii)
capital flight, bank and or balance o f
payments crises; (iii)
crowding out o f productive public spending due to reconstruction efforts; and (iv)
increased indebtedness which in turn may raise the rate o f interest reducing future investment. Depending on
the scale o f the disaster, other sectoral repercussions can be felt: the destruction o f schools may, for example,
retard educational progress.

5 1,
In 2004, one o f the most active seasons for tropical storms and hurricanes o n record since 1950, twice
as many o f these natural phenomena were registered. Hurricane Ivan, the longest-lasting hurricane since
1900, devastated Grenada, decimating the housing stock and causing an estimated EC$2bn (US$800 million)
of damage (St. Vincent and the Grenadines was also affected by Hurricane Ivan, though to a much lesser
extent). In St. Kitts and Nevis, Hurricane George caused more than US$400 million o f damage in 1998, just 9
years after Hurricane Hugo. Dominica was also recently struck by an earthquake, measuring 6.0 on the
Richter scale, causing damages estimated at 7 percent o f 2004 GDP. In 2005, the hurricane season began
earlier than normal, with Tropical Storm Emily causing additional damage while passing over Grenada.
52.
The cost o f natural disasters to individual countries can be substantially mitigated. Insurance and
capital markets can offset losses and the adoption o f good building practices, to international standards, can
significantly lower the level o f impact. Hurricane Ivan provides a good example: the only schools that were
left untouched in Grenada were two built with Bank assistance designed with rigorous attention paid to
hurricane-proof standards.

pita1 markets, and the 'self-in

14

53.
Disaster risk mitigation measures, such as appropriate zoning and hazard mapping, establishment and
enforcement o f building codes, and disaster information mechanisms should be promoted. These measures
can reduce loss o f life, infrastructure damage, and the cost o f ex-post insurance. Assisting regional cooperation and co-ordination o f disaster r i s k mitigation strategies i s important. The multilateral development
and finance institutions can help in this through: the provision o f technical assistance and financial resources;
promoting the exchange o f information on successful practice; and assisting regional co-operation and
coordination o f disaster risk mitigation strategies. Donor finance for mitigation measures, for example in
infrastructure, in small states subject to repeated natural disasters can have a very high pay-off.
54.
Given the small size o f their economies, the OECS countries are similarly susceptible to other
external shocks. The September 11, 2001 attacks and accompanying fall in tourism activities had a significant
impact on tourism, the most important source o f foreign revenue. The recent increase in o i l prices has also
strained these small economies. Fluctuations in real interest rates and possible cross-country contagion
arising from banking and currency crises are other possible shocks. These vulnerabilities point to the need for
the OECS economies to diversify their service export markets; strengthen their fiscal positions and reduce
debt levels; and reduce rigidities in their labor markets.

55.
The United Nations Framework Convention o n Climate Change (UNFCCC) has identified small
island nations as amongst the most vulnerable to anticipated impacts from climate change. Those impactslikely to hit coastal areas where a significant share o f economic activity takes place-are a result o f
externalities largely caused by resource intensive societies with a resultant significant effect on sustainable
development in these already fragile islands. Specifically, in terms o f coastal
it i s expected that
coral reefs w i l l be affected and may collapse, if seasonal maximum temperature sea surface temperatures
increase even slightly. In addition, increases in C 0 2 w i l l affect the ability o f reef plants and animals to calcify
and thus reduce the ability o f reefs to grow vertically and keep pace with anticipated rising sea levels. Also, in
near-shore marine and coastal areas, many wetlands w i l l be affected by changes in storm surges. These may
result in large-scale translocation o f populations in low-lying areas. Mangroves and coastal lagoons are
expected to undergo rapid change and perhaps be lost altogether as functioning ecosystems. Low-lying coastal
areas and associated swamps could also be displaced by saltwater habitats, disrupting freshwater ecosystems.
Such changes are likely to result in dislocation o f migratory birds and aquatic species that are not tolerant to
increased salinity or flooding and may even force large scale forced resettlement o f coastal areas.
56.
Agricultural Transition. The share o f agriculture as a percentage o f GDP has dropped dramatically,
from 15 percent in the 1980s to 8 percent in 2000, and i t continues to decline. There are two main reasons for
this: (i)
agriculture as i t i s practiced in the OECS countries i s no longer competitive: farms are very small (23 ha on average), many soils are degraded and hence productivity i s very low compared to other producers26
and (ii)
the erosion o f EU agricultural preferences which, until recently, guaranteed relatively high prices and
markets through quotas. Only the very efficient producers and marketers can compete in the high volume
non-differentiated markets.

57.
Agricultural trade preferences are set to end in 2007. Even without this impending change, the OECS
countries have not been able to fill the quotas at competitive prices. The reduction o f EU preferences for
bananas and sugar in the OECS has created a brutal shock for the rural economies. The EU quota preferences
have created an ago-economic environment that was not conducive to diversification neither in production,
nor in marketing or agro processing. Almost all the food for the non-rural population and the hotel industry i s
imported from the USA or other countries in the Caribbean. I t would appear that the agricultural policies o f
the OECS--to remain focused on traditional crops and to discourage local food production and processing in
particular high value foods, and perishable fruit and vegetables as well as staples--has failed. The move from
traditional crops has also been stymied because agriculture i s still strongly influenced by government
intervention (state production) and p r ~ t e c t i o n ~ A
~ . key challenge w i l l be finding alternative sources o f
employment for the farmers affected by the impending change in preferences, estimated to be 15 percent o f
the total workforce, who are largely older and less educated. In the banana industry alone, the numbers o f
registered and active growers have dropped from around 10,000 to 2,000 and those deriving all or an
important proportion of their earnings from bananas have fallen from around 30,000 to under 6,000.

58.
To support agricultural diversification, Governments could: (i)
s h i f t social support to rural areas from
subsidies for particular traditional crops (bananas, sugar, nutmeg) to family income support (cash transfers);
(ii)
help attract foreign investment in agriculture (for instance returning migrants) to set up or financially
The Government o f Grenada, for example, has repeatedly subsidized the nutmeg industry through subsidies and soft loans to the
Grenada Nutmeg Producers Association.

participate in sizeable farm enterprises that can timely provide the market with quality produce in sufficient
quantities; (iii)
help finance training o f young farmers in modem farming and marketing techniques; (iv)
encourage linkages between the farming sector and the hotel industry or other commercial private sector in
order to create a local market for local produce; and (v) help the small-scale agro-processing sector to
transform local produce into products (jams, spices, oils) that can be sold to visiting tourists or in ethnic
markets abroad. Lastly, OECS countries w i l l have to ensure adequate land use planning to protect fertile land
from being occupied b y human settlements.

59.

The Bank has not been active in the agricultural sector in the OECS countries, as there i s significant
support from the European Union through a variety o f specially-established funds such as SFA and
STA13EX28 Nevertheless, the Bank, in collaboration with FAO/CP Investment Center i s carrying out a study
on successful diversification initiatives in the sub-region.

Environment. To remain competitive in the tourism industry and to reduce the impact o f climate
60.
change and natural disasters, the OECS countries w i l l have to enhance their efforts to preserve and protect the
natural environment. Tourism remains highly concentrated in coastal zones, dependent on the availability and
beauty o f the natural assets o f the coast and near-shore marine waters. These coastal areas are also the
principal sites for human settlements and development and poorly planned development projects pose a
growing risk to the “health” o f the natural resources and surrounding environment. In seeking growth, the
OECS needs to ensure that the environment i s not undermined, cheapening the Caribbean tourism “brand” in
the face o f increasing competition.

61.
The key environmental problems in the OECS are: degradation o f coral reefs and other highly
productive coastal and near-shore marine habitats, loss o f marine biodiversity, declines in the environmental
quality o f beaches and adjacent waters, a deteriorating landscape and an increasing susceptibility to natural
disasters, Some o f the causes include lack o f wastewater treatment, agro-industrial pollution, agricultural runoff and soil erosion, and lack o f housing planning and building regulations. The problems are exacerbated by
the weak public sector capacity to address environmental issues and the anticipated ravages caused by climate
change. Also, there i s a lack o f financial resources to monitor and address the problems. But there are also
major institutional shortcomings including: (i)
the lack o f a systematic monitoring program; (ii)
weaknesses in
legislation and accompanying regulations; and (iii)
lack o f transparency and public disclosure (at least in
practice). Addressing the issue o f environmental management w i l l not only benefit OECS citizens and the
tourist industry, but w i l l also strengthen the island’s defenses to natural hazards. For example physical
mitigation measures taken to ensure that coastal regions are protected from erosion w i l l help deflect the brunt
of hurricanes and promoting watershed management w i l l protect the region from flooding.

62.
There has been progress in some areas o f environmental management in the OECS sub-region, driven
by (i)
what appears to be a growing demand for, and public and private response to, opportunities in the
ecotourism niche market; (ii)
enlightened self-interest among tourist operators in protecting the environment;
and (iii)
a relatively well-educated population becoming more conscious o f environmental quality concems.
But much remains to be done, particularly in the areas o f sub-regional-wide monitoring o f critical ecosystems;
policy reforms; regional and national institutional strengthening; and public awareness.
Global climate change i s a major challenge to environmental sustainability. Island nations,
63,
including those in the Caribbean, are experiencing the brunt o f changes linked to increased sea levels,
increased sea surface temperature, reduced precipitation, increased climate variability and other related
changes. The impacts o f climate change also affect the natural resources on which key economic activity
depends, such as fisheries and tourism. W h i l e many o f these changes are irreversible, some can be mitigated
and many others w i l l require adaptation measures to cope with the anticipated impacts. The Bank has been
active in the sub-region through the Global Environmental Facility that funds the Mainstreaming Adaptation
to Climate Change Project (MACC) building institutional capacity and developing climate change adaptation
strategies in the Caribbean. More specific climate change adaptation investment projects are under
development in St. Lucia, Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
~~

The European Union‘s Special Framework for Assistance Programme (SFA) and STABEX allocations are sources o f support to
countries making the difficult transition from agricultural dependent economies. STABEX funds to Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines have totaled 200 million euros, and SFA funds have totaled 189 million euros. These amounts are
outside the National Indicative Programs (NIPS) allocated under the European Development Fund (EDF).

17

64.
In addition to ongoing M A C C efforts in the region, the Bank w i l l selectively pursue opportunities in
carbon finance, under the guidelines o f the Kyoto Protocol, that could contribute to ecosystem restoration. A
project in Trinidad and Tobago (Nariva Wetland restoration) exemplifies the approach to be taken.

The Institutional Context
65.
The public sector in the OECS countries has several positive characteristics, notably the existence o f a
permanent public service that provides continuity, institutional memory and stability at the administrative
level, irrespective o f who rules at the political level; the existence o f well-established organizational structures
and institutional rules and regulations; and the general respect o f the rule o f law and a high degree o f judicial
independence. There i s also little evidence o f widespread systemic corruption. However, despite these
strengths and some OECS countries’ recent efforts to modernize their public sectors, the latter have failed to
adapt to the changing external environment. Indeed, in order to better compete in the global economy, the
OECS countries will need to improve their public sector’s organizational structures and enhance efficiency
and cost effectiveness o f the delivery o f public services.
66.
Feedback from consultations with the private sector identified the need for a more nurturing
environment for successful private sector development; and several studies have highlighted inadequate
incentives and accountability for public sector performance, the existence o f weak internal control systems
and oversight bodies, and inadequate mechanisms for regular evaluation o f policies, programs, projects and
public agency performance. In addition to these institutional problems, serious organizational capacity
constraints exist. Even though the OECS countries are small and have extremely limited resources, the span
o f their public sector functions matches that o f many large countries. Given their size and although most
governments have undertaken steps to privatize or commercialize some o f their functions, their mandate
continues to be too wide vis-&vis their ability to deliver on it. Another critical deficiency o f the public sector
in the OECS i s the insufficiency of qualified persons to run the business o f the State-again due to their small
size, which i s compounded by the migration o f skilled staff.

In several areas, capacity constraints and diseconomies o f small scale can be addressed through
67.
regional integration and cooperation, yet the principle hurdles remain the perceived protection o f sovereignty,
insufficient public information o n the benefits o f integration, and a wide gap between political support and
implementation. The OECS countries have made some progress in regional integration and cooperation.
Recognizing these efforts, under the 2002-2005 CAS the Bank has been supporting OECS regional integration
efforts in the areas o f telecommunications, environmental management, HIV/AIDS and education sector
reform. However, i t i s broadly acknowledged by clients and donors alike that the scope o f regional and subregional economic integration and functional cooperation have not been exploited to their full potential.
In light o f the above, the Bank has recently been working with the ECCB and the OECS Secretariat
68.
on the formulation of an OECS public sector transformation strategy, pulling together a group o f respected
change agents from the region to present approaches to the Heads. Under this strategy, public opinion polling
o n attitudes towards public service delivery were
This approach o f trying to crystallize homegrown strategies offers a model for reform in a number o f other areas in the CAS, such as youth and social
protection. The strategy would focus on actions to modernize public administration, enhance growth
supporting public services, rationalize the delivery of social services through more effective and affordable
modes o f service delivery, and improve their targeting. Interventions could include: refocusing the scope of
public sector activities to match capacity; intensifying efforts to reap economies o f scale and improve
efficiency by enhancing regional and sub-regional integration and cooperation; completing institutional and
capacity building reforms and improving the institutional framework o f human resource management in the
public sector; improving the investment climate to promote private sector development; and increasing the
transparency o f the public sector by improving dissemination o f information to the public and intensifying
civil society consultation and participation, including the use o f public service delivery “score-cards”.
Increased regional cooperation and integration of selected public sector services (e.g., procurement, auditing)
and regulatory frameworks for public utilities (see para 40) are other critical areas for public sector
transformation in the OECS countries which can help overcome their diseconomies o f scale.
29 As a first step in this process, the OECS Heads o f Govemment were presented with a note on “Public Sector Transformation”,
prepared by the ECCB and OECS with Bank support, at the OECS Heads o f Govemment meeting on November 11,2004.

111. The OECS Governments’ Development Strategy
The OECS Secretariat and the OECS Development Charter
69.
Recognizing the need for a sub-regional organization to assist the OECS countries in their
development efforts, a series o f institutions were established post-independence, The most recent incamation
o f these i s the OECS Secretariat, which was established in 1981. I t s original mandate, set out in the Treaty o f
Basseterre, was to promote cooperation and economic integration among the Member States, and defend their
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence; this has recently evolved to include a focus on research
and strategic policy advice, resource mobilization and technical support.
70.
Following a period o f weak management, the new Director-General assumed the helm o f the
Secretariat, which has 100 staff (half the size o f the Caribbean Development Bank) just over two years ago.
Since then the organization has undergone restructuring to reflect the new policy and advisory focus o f i t s
work. The Secretariat’s ability to deliver on its mandate has to date been severely constrained by: (i)
i t s lack
o f capacity at all levels; (ii)
its limited financial resources, exacerbated by members countries’ inability to
pay; and (iii)
the lack o f much needed political support to move forward on regional initiatives.
In October 2002, the OECS Member States ratified the OECS Development Charter, which was
71.
developed over several years by the OECS Secretariat and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. The Charter
maps out, in broad terms, a vision for the long-term development o f the OECS and seeks to stimulate a
dialogue around the following:
0

0
0
0

The definition o f new economic parameters for growth;
Integrating social and environmental parameters into the development agenda;
Mobilizing a wider cross-section o f donors as partners in the development agenda; and;
A greater inclusion o f the private sector, civil society and communities.

72.
W h i l e the core socio-economic development priorities contained in the Charter form the framework
within which the OECS Secretariat can begin a dialogue between the sub-region’s Governments and with
donors, the Charter lacks focus, making i t difficult for donors to plan their assistance in line with regional
priorities Covering everything from reducing poverty to the development o f sports, increasing access to
quality education to good governance, the Charter lacks specificity and a prioritization o f key interventions
and reforms needed in light o f the OECS countries’ multiple challenges and limited capacity.
73.
There are a number o f sectoral strategies in place, progress on which appears to be stagnant, and all o f
which have entailed the establishment o f a unit within the Secretariat to address thematic or sectoral
challenges, be they environmental management, educational or judicial reform. What appears to be a
stumbling block, however, i s the ability to draw up implementation plans and policy directives.

Progress made on OECS regional integration
74.
T o date, there have been limited, but noteworthy success stories on regional integration. The Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) i s widely recognized as a firm and steady hand on maintaining the stability
o f the EC dollar and the integrity o f the OECS members’ banking system. That said, notwithstanding a
common central bank and a common currency, the OECS countries conduct fiscal policy independently and
the deterioration o f fiscal positions in recent years has re-initiated discussion among i t s members on the need
to better coordinate fiscal policies.
ECTEL
75.
Subordinating national interests to a regional entity has been fully achieved elsewhere: (i)
(discussed earlier), the world’s first regional telecommunications authority, broke the monopoly o f Cable and
Wireless, resulting in greater competition and improved access; (ii)
the OECS Pharmaceutical Procurement
Service (PPS), a successful regional apparatus which regulates, negotiates and procures pharmaceuticals
region-wide; (iii)
the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC), which has unlimitedjurisdiction across the
sub-region’s states and territories; and (iv) the Directorate o f Civil Aviation (DCA), a vehicle for facilitating a
collective and uniform approach to civil aviation matters affecting the Eastern Caribbean.
76.
Finally, there are a multitude o f pan-regional bodies and initiatives, including CARICOM, the
Regional Negotiating Machinery, CARICAD, the Caribbean Forum for Development and others, in which the
OECS members are all represented and are actively involved. Despite these initiatives, and as indicated

19

above the scope o f regional and sub-regional economic integration and functional collaboration still remains
to be exploited to its full potential.

Development Partners and other stakeholders in the OECS
77.
Although donor assistance has been declining to the sub-region30, the OECS i s well served by several
bilateral and multilateral agencies, including the CDB (which also on-lends IDB funds), EU, OAS, the World
Bank and the UN, and, for the bilaterals, CIDA, DFID, USAID, China, Japan, Kuwait, France, and Taiwan,
China. Within the overall context o f external assistance, the Bank’s contribution i s relatively small,
accounting for around 10 percent o f total disbursements. W h i l e relations with the donor community are good,
and the dialogue active, overall coordination in the OECS i s fragmented. In some countries and some sectors,
there i s overcrowding (as in the case o f education in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, or regional trade issues),
while in other areas (youth) there appears to be a lack o f technical expertise, matched by an absence o f
resources. Donors and OECS Governments alike recognize the need to move beyond meetings and analysis
to implementation, but the rhetoric has yet to be matched by action on the part o f both governments and
donors.
78.
There have, however, been recent positive moves towards greater coordination and harmonization. In
Dominica, which has undertaken a major economic stabilization and adjustment effort, the donors have rallied
to support this program by closely coordinating and prioritizing the provision o f their financial support and
technical assistance to strengthen government capacity for implementation. In part due to these concerted
efforts and together with government commitment, the Dominica program i s being implemented with
reasonable success. Similarly, in Grenada, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Ivan, donors not
only turned out in force at two major donor meetings (one hosted by the Bank in Washington, the other by the
Government in Grenada), but have also agreed to harmonize procedures, synchronize missions and reporting,
and select lead donors in the main sectors so as to avoid duplication o f efforts. This i s the first such
coordinated response to a natural disaster in the Caribbean.
79.
The Bank i s the only major donor that does not have a physical presence in Barbados, making
representation and coordination more challenging and costly, albeit significantly cheaper than establishing an
office in the sub-region. I t should be noted, also, that the Bank does not lend to Barbados. There are,
however, numerous fora where donors meet (including the Caribbean Forum for Development (formerly the
CGCED), CDB Annual Meetings, OECS Secretariat and UNDP Donor Meetings) and CARTAC Steering
Committee Meetings, and recent efforts to host videoconferenced planning meetings have been well received.
80.
In addition to greater harmonization and collaboration with the donors generally, the Bank plans to
collaborate more closely at both the project and analytical and advisory levels, particularly with the EU,
which has expressed an interest in exploring the provision o f grant-financed budgetary support against Bank
and/or IMF programs. In recognition of the Bank’s technical expertise and global knowledge, the EU i s
channeling increasing amounts o f (concessional) hnding through the Bank’s projects, using both bilateral and
Multi-Donor Trust Funds3’. The first of these Trust Funds has recently been established in Grenada: the EU
has allocated €8.4 mn in grant funds for a School Rehabilitation Project, to be administered by the World
Bank. The Trust Fund w i l l also cover technical assistance for Bank-executed activities.
30 Net ODA to the six OECS countries, which spiked from US$78 mn i n 2001 to US$121 mn in 2002, decreased to US$49 mn in
2003.
3’ Since the late 199Os, use of the Bank as a conduit for other donors’ funds has been steadily increasing, from about $IOmillion in the
late 1990s to about $450 million in 2004.

86.
Donors from East Asia have played a significant role in the sub-region’s development. In the period
from 1999 to 2003, Japan disbursed approximately US$116 million to the OECS (US$17 million o f which
was disbursed in 2003, the most recent figures available), with the fisheries sector being the primary recipient.
But it i s China (including Taiwan, China) --which have recently committed significant amounts for
development in the sub-region, the former offering US$lOO million to Grenada alone for development
projects over the next ten years-which are the largest bilateral contributors to the sub-region.
87.
Other bilateral donors include France--which over the last five years has committed and disbursed
approximately US$13 million in bilateral and regional-cooperation grants and a further US$49 million in
loans for the health sector, culture and capacity building across the OECS countries--and Kuwait, which has
committed grant funds, over the period 2000-2005 o f U S $496,000 for the housing sector in Grenada and
US$334,000 for roads in St. Lucia. A Donor Harmonization Table i s attached (Appendix 4).

88.
Relations with the IMF. The Fund conducts biannual regional surveillance discussions on the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union and individual Article IV consultations with each o f the six OECS
countries. Financial support i s currently being provided by the Fund to Dominica through a 3-year PRGF
arrangement for SDR 7.7 million (94 percent o f quota) from 2003-2006. Dominica’s performance under this
program has so far been satisfactory. Moreover, following Hurricane Ivan, financial support in the amount o f
SDR 2.93 million (25 percent o f quota) was extended to Grenada in November 2004 under the Fund’s
emergency assistance policy for natural disasters. A similar amount was extended to Grenada under the same
policy in January 2003 following Tropical Storm Lili. IMF technical assistance i s being provided to member
countries in the sub-region on tax policy and tax administration reform, including the introduction o f a ValueAdded Tax. Assistance i s also being provided through CARTAC in statistics, public finance management, tax
administration, and regulation and supervision o f the financial sector.
NGOs and Media. The N G O community in the OECS sub-region, while vibrant, remains small and
89.
tends to be community or country specific in i t s interests. Given its size, and resource constraints, there i s
limited scope for much needed cross-fertilization o f ideas and concerns across islands. Governments have not
appeared to consistently include NGOs in the development o f regional strategies and there i s significant scope
to increase their role in this regard.

The media, however, which i s deep-rooted within OECS society - particularly in the area o f radio
90.
broadcasts - i s often dependent on party affiliation and can be highly critical o f Governments. There are
around a dozen newspapers across the sub-region, none o f which are dailies. Readership among the middleclasses i s high and i t i s not uncommon for households to receive two or three competing newspapers per
week. Coverage tends to be localized and the lack o f a deeply entrenched sub-regional media makes the task
o f mobilizing support for regional integration more challenging. While Bank engagement o f the media in the
sub-region has been limited in the past, recent Bank efforts to engage the media have been successful. An
OECS public information strategy i s currently under development, for implementation through a newly
established Public Information Center, based in St. Lucia. Ongoing dissemination o f the two recently
completed Growth and Competitiveness Reports (the OECS-specific and the broader Caribbean-wide study)
presents an excellent opportunity to broaden the public debate around key development challenges facing the
OECS countries.

I V The World Bank and the OECS
History of Bank Engagement
91.
Up until 1987, the bulk o f Bank lending to the OECS was conducted via on-lending from lines o f
credit to the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The goal o f this approach was to: (i)
channel resources to
member countries “at a lower cost than the Bank could do directly”, and (ii)strengthen CDB as a regional
development institution. In 1997, this lending approach was discontinued following the poor performance o f
the last three lines o f credit and a request from the OECS Heads o f Government that the Bank assume direct
lending. The 2001-2005 CAS was the first CAS to provide Bank lending and AAA directly to OECS clients.
I t had two overarching objectives: (i)reduce income insecurity and vulnerability at the aggregate and
household levels; and (ii)
build human and institutional capacity. The CAS also called for increasing use of
group operations under sub-regional umbrella mechanisms (such as horizontal APLs) with the aim o f
promoting sub-regional integration and achieving cost-effectiveness in Bank operations. Financial assistance
was provided on blend terms (50 percent IDA; 50 percent BRD), under the small island economies
exception.

The Bank’s Lending Portfolio under the last CAS
92.
Of the $107 million lending program which was envisaged, $79 million (not including the HIViAIDS
program for which the regional commitment was made during the earlier CAS) has been delivered as o f July
2005. The majority o f these projects were part o f horizontal APLs or regional programs. Non-programmed
lending comprised the Emergency Recovery operations, the follow-on regional telecommunications reform
project, the follow-on St. Lucia Water Reform project and the Dominica Economic Recovery Support
Operation (ERSO) as well as the post-Hurricane Ivan Emergency Recovery loan to Grenada.

The Bank’s AAA under the last CAS
95.
There was a significant increase in AAA delivered during the last CAS, the majority o f which was
core diagnostic work such as PERs, CFAAs and CPARs, the latter two o f which were undertaken and
presented jointly as pan-sub-regional analyses, as was the Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review
(IOCR)32. A number o f reports, including those on youth and income instability were prepared for discussion
at the 2002 Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED). The Growth and
Competitiveness reports were presented at the Caribbean Forum for Development in Barbados in M a y 2005.

96.
The OECS lending and AAA portfolio has benefited from a number o f assessments, conducted by
both the Quality Assurance Group and the Operations Evaluation Department. Quality at Entry Assessments
were conducted for three o f the projects launched under the 2001-05 CAS and a further two projects from the
previous CAS were evaluated for the quality o f supervision. One Quality o f ESW Assessment was
undertaken for the OECS CPAR.
97.
In addition, the sub-region benefited from a comprehensive Q A G Review o f the Bank’s work in the
OECS, which covered both active and closed projects. The Q A G assessment was a critical input to both the
CAS Completion Report and to the formulation o f this CAS.

Lessons Learned
98.
The CAS Completion Report (attached in Appendix 1) gives detailed analysis o f the key lessons
learned over the last CAS period. On lending33,there i s broad recognition that the Bank’s technical expertise
in project design has made a significant contribution to the sub-region’s development. However, project
implementation has not always gone smoothly and a number o f areas were cited as contributing to the often
lackluster implementation o f Bank projects. One area i s the overly complex project design, which has led to
lengthy delays in effectiveness and a sense that the project timetable was more Bank-driven than client-led.
This i s particularly the case for APL projects. While, by using APLs, the Bank captured economies o f scale
o f preparation and supervision, the OECS clients did not always capture the regional economies o f scale and
the opportunities for “cross-country learning” inherent in the A P L were not exploited. Greater attention to
client preparedness w i l l be key moving forward to ensure that regional approaches are more successful and
that the knowledge gains are fully harnessed.

99.
The Bank’s procedures are particularly cumbersome to small states and often, the knowledge o f the
plethora o f processes and their paperwork hinges upon the performance o f a Project Management Unit (PMU)
which in turn may translate to one or two persons. The absence or departure o f key staff has left a
disproportionate number o f projects pending, further exacerbating tensions between PMUs, Central Tender
Boards and line ministries. This underscores the need for two new approaches: (i)
simplified procedures
embodied in simplified instruments, as proposed through the new SCUP (see B o x 7); and (ii)
additional
training in the fiduciary areas o f financial management and procurement for future operations. Roll-out o f
these two elements would ensure that (a) projects are implemented when the client i s ready and (b) that, once
effective, the client has the capacity to bring the projects to timely and successful fruition.
100.
Arguably, where the Bank has had the greatest impact in its lending, has been in two areas. First,
interventions involving policy reform, such as the Dominica ERSO and the ECTEL project - which sought,
respectively, to restore fiscal balance and encourage a resumption o f growth and to dismantle a crippling
telecommunications monopoly while establishing a regulatory framework. Second, interventions which
responded to unforeseen crises-such as the post 9-1 1 Emergency Recovery Loans and the Hurricane Ivan
contingency facility. The Bank’s work in such situations has been broadly recognized as demonstrating the
Bank’s ability to bring its global knowledge to bear in the first instance and to work flexibly and swiftly with
both clients and donors under pressure in the second.

101. There i s similarly broad acknowledgement for the Bank’s analytical rigor in its AAA. But while
AAA i s highly valued by govemments and regional institutions and are well regarded by the academic
33 It should be noted, however, that the Bank’s programs have moved relatively swiftly and smoothly compared with other donors’
projects.

107. Regional projects over the period o f the last CAS, included (i)
a US$17.5 million regional credit line
with Royal Merchant Bank (FYO1); (ii)two regional credit line operations (US$20 million in FY02, and
US$50 million in FY03) with the Republic Bank: these two operations facilitate the regional integration o f the
financial services industry, allowing Republic Bank to enter Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean market o f St.
Lucia, in addition to Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Grenada and the Cayman Islands; (iii)
an up to US$4.6
million equity investment and a US$10 million IFC loan to finance the expansion o f the Digicel Group’s
mobile telephony into the Eastern Caribbean; and (iv) University o f the West Indies-Institute o f Business
(UWI-IOB) - a US$5 million IFC loan to the Institute o f Business in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago

26

financing the construction o f a new US$10 million campus. I O B i s a private business school affiliated with
UWI, an autonomous regional institution backed by and serving 15 Commonwealth countries in the
Caribbean. The Institute’s new campus w i l l provide modern, well-equipped facilities for i t s core activities in
graduate business education, as well as short-term training, research, and consulting activities. UWI includes
students from Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, Grenada, St. K i t t s and Nevis, St. Lucia (which has
i t s own university center), and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, among others. In addition, IFC provided
direct financing o f US$1 million for the Bel Air Plantation in Grenada, a tourism sector project in FY02,
108, Non-investment activities included ongoing assistance with the development o f the Caribbean Small
Hotel Brands (as part o f the larger OAS Caribbean Small Hotels Assistance Project) targeted to small
hoteliers in the Caribbean, and a study to identify the major legal, regulatory and institutional barriers to
investment in OECS countries. In a similar vein, the Caribbean Business Toolkit, (see Box 6 ) was
launched.
BOX 6: SME TOOLKIT PROGRAM IN THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN

Bank Exposure
109. As o f June 2005, total OECS debt to the Bank was US$123 million, o f which US$37 million i s IBRD
debt. There i s an additional US$49.8 million o f undisbursed IBRD commitments. St. Kitts and Nevis has
the highest IBRD debt at US$13.5 million and St. Vincent and the Grenadines the lowest, at less than US$1
million. With no IBRD lending planned for the base case, existing exposure levels under this scenario would
improve. Under the high case scenario, IBRD exposure and risk indicators would remain at reasonable levels
(see Annexes 4-9 for respective countries).

V. Country Assistance Strategy, FYO6-09
A New Way o f Doing Business
110. In January 2005, the six OECS Heads o f Government, the Governor o f the ECCB and the DirectorGeneral o f the OECS Secretariat met with the President o f the World Bank in Grenada. Cognizant o f the need
for increased growth and improved competitiveness o f their economies, their susceptibility to natural
disasters, and the potential erosion o f social gains, their discussions focused on the opportunities and
challenges facing the sub-region. Key among the challenges identified were (i)
the need to stimulate growth
and improve competitiveness; (ii)
growing unemployment, particularly among young people; (iii)
weak social
safety nets; (iv) the impact o f s k i l l s migration and i t s consequences on the labor market; (v) the need for
efficiency gains through modernizing the public sector; (vi) the need for increased resilience to natural
disasters; and (vii) the need to protect the environment. Finally, the challenge o f realizing regional economies
o f scale was clearly articulated and the example o f ECTEL was lauded as best practice for future
interventions.
111, Against this background, and taking into account the lessons learned from the previous CAS, Heads
o f Government and the Bank agreed on the basic parameters for a new development partnership.
112.

113.

For its part, the World Bank Group would:
support regional integration through regional interventions - in such areas as catastrophe risk
insurance; public sector reform; s k i l l s enhancement and youth-at-risk; and the regulatory framework
for utilities;
help to (i)
establish a new partnership between the OECS and the donor community, based on CDF
principles and (ii)
leverage other donor concessional support through innovative mechanisms such as
the creation o f Multi Donor Trust Funds;
simplify Bank processes to make them more user-friendly to small states; and
support capacity building efforts in key areas o f project implementation.
In turn, the sub-region would :

restore medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability through a mix o f fiscal adjustment, growthenhancing structural reforms, improved debt management and possible debt restructuring;
0
flesh out the Development Charter by defining 3-4 key development objectives with clear timelines
and benchmarks which donors can support, in a coordinated and harmonized fashion, based o n their
comparative advantage; and
0
work closely with the Bank and other donors to unlock hitherto un-disbursed donor grant financing
for key projects and programs in the sub-region.
114. The Heads agreed o n the need to refine their development agenda, prioritizing those areas needing
more urgent attention while incorporating specific outcome indicators and monitorable benchmarks. They
also concurred with Bank management that given high debt levels, additional IBRD lending would exacerbate
already tight fiscal positions and that, wherever possible, concessional resources from other donors should be
dovetailed with the Bank’s well-respected analytical work and technical assistance, and IDA financing.
0

115.
Given limited resources and weak institutional capacity, the Bank proposed a number o f ways to
strengthen coordination and to take steps to expedite harmonization efforts. The Bank also discussed a
number o f measures to simplify procedures which are small-state unfriendly and to take steps to enhance
capacity building efforts in government, beginning at the project implementation level. This proposed
approach was echoed in the area o f AAA, where there was general agreement that more “just-in-time”
analytical work would help to support their reform agenda as a complement to diagnostic work.

FYO6-09 Bank Program o f Assistance
116. Reflecting the challenges laid out during the meeting, the lessons learned from the previous CAS and
building on thematic and sectoral areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage, Bank activities w i l l be
guided by three main principles:
(i)supporting regional integration and coordination efforts;

28

(ii)
partnering and harmonization in both lending and analytical work with other development partners;
and
(iii)
active pursuit o f simplification and capacity building initiatives tailored to these small states.
117.
Specifically, the Bank would seek to strengthen i t s role vis-&vis other donor agencies by increasing
collaboration on convergent sectors o f interest, as i s currently being piloted with DFID in the area o f
education and the EU on education and ICT. Ina similar vein, the Bank would build on the broad dialogue on
stabilization and structural reform measures that took place in Dominica in 2004-05; the extensive amount o f
economic and sector work conducted by the Bank and other donors; and the EU’s expressed interest in
marrying the EU’s significant concessional resources with Bank technical expertise and lighter operational
procedures. To pilot this approach, a Multi-Donor Trust Fund would be established to provide EU
complementary financing to Dominica for a reform agenda supported by a PRSC, with a view to extending
this modality to other countries in the region if successful.
118.
In an effort to encourage coordination and foster transparency around donor activities in the subregion, the Bank w i l l continue to develop and share tools to facilitate information on aid flows. The RedBook
Online--a web-based e-resource for tracking aid flows and sectoral and thematic knowledge--which was
designed in collaboration with UNDP, has recently been shared, in a pilot form, with donors and w i l l be rolled
out to OECS clients in early 2006, complementing the Client Connections tracking system which was
delivered in late 2004.
119.
In a continued effort to simplify and streamline procedures, and to ensure that efficiency gains in
project design and management are achieved, the Bank has proposed a pilot o f a Simplified Country Umbrella
Program (SCUP - see box 7) in the OECS.
120.
Responding to pervasive weaknesses in the project implementation units, and in an effort to
rationalize and harmonize the existing duplicative functions undertaken by multiple ministries within single
countries, the Bank w i l l deliver an intensive training program in the areas o f procurement, financial
management, and project management. The OECS Capacity Building Program will be delivered to both
Project Management Unit staff working on ongoing projects and to staff within line ministries. The Central
Tender Boards, which have oversight o n their respective country’s procurement, w i l l also benefit from this
training.

121. Given capacity constraints within these small states and the need to reach a broader range o f
stakeholders, the Bank w i l l pursue approaches that closely engage regional and national agencies and actors.
The recent example o f workshops, focus groups and public opinion polling used for the preparation o f an
OECS Public Sector Transformation strategy, undertaken with the OECS Secretariat and the ECCB, i s a
model that the Bank plans to follow for other AAA activities.

FYO6-09 Bank Lending Program and Terms
122.

The lending strategy has two main pillars:

1. stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and
2. reducing vulnerability.
123. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities
w i l l focus on leveraging available donor grant financing. Following the recommendations o f the recently
completed growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, DBRD and IDA support would focus on providing
technical and financial assistance for interventions to support the two main pillars. T o stimulate growth and
improve competitiveness, projects would address: public sector modernization and competitiveness, and
public utilities reform; to help reduce vulnerability, projects would address catastrophe risk insurance, s k i l l s
enhancement, social protection and environmental management.

The OECS Infrastructure and Utilities Reform Investment/TA program would be a regional
benchmarking and regulatory assistance project for the water and electricity sectors, building on the
successful establishment o f ECTEL, the OECS regional telecommunications regulator, and the nearlycompleted PPIAF assistance to Dominica that has developed a performance-based regulatory regime to
replace the cost-plus framework. The project would explore reforms in pricing as well as operation and
oversight o f electricity and water companies and would undertake a regional and international benchmarking
o f the utilities with the objective o f increasing efficiency and raising awareness both in government and with
the public o f the relative performance o f the local utility.
127. Environmental Management Project. To remain competitive in the tourism sector, the OECS
countries will need to enhance the management o f their natural environment. This includes (i)strict
enforcement o f environmental policies for land use planning, urban-rural zoning regulations and landscaping;
(ii)
conservation and expansion o f natural areas; (iii)
monitoring o f the quality o f coastal waters and beaches;
and (iv) additional efforts in solid waste management, waste water treatment and water and air pollution
control. Moreover, to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters (under pillar 2 below), measures to reduce
erosion and promote reforestation are also necessary. T o improve environmental management, the project
would focus on policy reforms, region-wide monitoring o f critical ecosystems and water quality, regional and
national institutional strengthening, infrastructure investments and increasing public awareness. Cooperation
with the private (tourism) sector and communities w i l l be an integral part o f the program to participate in
international environmental certification schemes. The project would use a simplified lending instrument, as
described below, to enable governments to obtain just-in-time small Bank loans and possibly grants from the
Global Environment Facility and other grant agencies.

Pillar 2: Reducing Vulnerability
128.
The OECS Governments have signaled their interest in participating in a CARICOM-wide
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project, institutionalizing a comprehensive risk management approach. The
project w i l l strive to deepen insurance markets to allow for the improved sharing o f insurable and uninsurable
risks among the public sector, private sector, international insurance industry, international capital markets,
and the domestic 'self-insured' population. The leveraging o f scarce capital to diversify and better spread
risks, as well as to significantly increase the efficiency o f risk transfer mechanisms, would require a subregional risk pooling mechanism. The CARICOM countries have indicated their commitment to increase
their limited leverage while exploiting the best terms for reinsurance protection through shared risk
diversification and faster accumulation o f domestic insurance reserves. The project w i l l be designed to ensure
that the "productive purposes" test i s satisfied and efforts would be made so that reporting mechanisms are in
place to fully ensure that reconstruction o f productive capacity i s the primary target for such funding under a
pre-planned risk mitigation approach, and used to reimburse the government for budgets displaced toward
reconstruction due to emergencies. There i s a precedent for the Bank providing assistance for premia via
loans (Turkey Narmara Earthquake reconstruction project), but the proposed Caribbean C R I project i s clearly
more complex given the multi-country and shared risk approach proposed.

W h i l e efforts w i l l be focused on promoting ex post emergency reliefh-econstruction facilities through
129.
insurance pooling, attention will also be directed towards continuing the dialogue with both the Governments
and the international community to reinforce ex ante vulnerability reduction.

Building on the recent analytical work undertaken through the OECS on social protection strategies,
130.
the OECS Social Protection program would have a two-pronged approach: (i)
to scale up community-driven
micro-projects, targeting the poor and vulnerable segments o f the population; and (ii)to support
implementation o f country-level reforms, including improving systems for monitoring and targeting, and
rationalizing o f existing social assistance programs under one social find. Reforms at the national level
would be supported in different phases under an umbrella OECS program - St. Lucia i s expected to be the
first "roll-out" country to receive assistance, where efforts would focus on strengthening the institutional
framework. These efforts would dovetail with the ongoing work at the CARICOM level on reform in such
areas as social insurance and labor mobility.
13 1.
The GEF-funded Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change project seeks to assist in the
incorporation o f climate change concerns in sector and regional planning for the OECS nations and to identify
critical vulnerabilities.

31

IDA and IBRD lending scenarios and instrument choice: As indicated earlier, a critical problem
132.
o f the OECS countries i s their high levels o f debt and consequent weakened (or lack of) creditworthiness. At
the same time, the social and economic restructuring challenges faced by these small states call for continued
Bank engagement. This engagement should, however, be contingent on progress in improving fiscal balances
and reducing debt levels. On this basis, Bank assistance to the OECS over the period FY06-09 would be
structured along the following (See Table 8):
0

0

0

An indicative Base Case lending scenario consisting o f about US$51.3 million in IDA resources34for
the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines).
This number includes the estimated IDA country allocations for each o f the four countries during
FY06-09, and an IDA Regional allocation o f $15.2 million for two regional projects: US$12 million
for Catastrophe Risk Insurance and US$3.2 million for Infrastructure and Utilities Reform. The
regional project funds, which are counted as additional to the ceilings established for country
allocations, must be matched with one-third o f IDA funds from those country allocation^^^.
A High Case lending scenario consisting o f an additional US$52.1 million in IBRD investment and
D P L commitments.
A L o w Case lending scenario consisting o f about US$3 1 million in IDA resources for the four OECS
blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) including the
regional funds mentioned above.)

133.
W h i l e most o f the planned operations would be for investment lending, the CAS includes in the base
case PRSCs for Dominica and possible IDA-financed DPLs for Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines to enable the Bank to support the early phases o f ambitious stabilization and policy reform
programs if these countries decide to undertake them. Under the high case lending scenario, IBRb-financed
development policy lending would be available for these four same countries to pursue policy reform efforts
in the areas o f growth and competitiveness and to St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda (which are
IBRD only) to support them in policy reform programs to restore fiscal and debt sustainability, and to
stimulate growth and improve competitiveness o f their economies.
134.
The two regional projects-catastrophe risk insurance and the regional Public Utilities Project, which
would seek to duplicate the successful approach employed to establish the regional regulatory authority in the
telecommunications sector, ECTEL-would be prepared for simultaneous multi-country implementation. The
other projects would be prepared and rolled out to countries on a sequential basis, using an A P L approach
with those countries most ready and interested going first and others coming on-stream later during the CAS
period.
34 In line with the IDA 14 agreement (covering FY06-08), each country’s IDA allocation i s determined annually using
the performance based allocation system. Hence, the allocation numbers in the CAS are indicative and for planning
purposes; they could shift as a result o f the annual performance o f all IDA borrowers, exchange rate fluctuations or shifts
in the size o f the total IDA envelope at the time o f annual allocation.
35

Regional projects, eligible for funding from this source are defined as operations:
that involve three or more countries, all o f which need to participate for the project’s objectives to be achievable (Le.
0)
the project would not make sense without the participation o f all countries);
whose benefits, either economic or social, spill over country boundaries (Le. that generate significant positive
(ii)
externalities or mitigate negative ones);
where there i s clear evidence o f country or regional ownership which demonstrates commitment o f the majority o f
(iii)
participating countries;
that provide a platform for a high level o f policy harmonization between countries (this i s key to the success o f a
(iv)
regional initiative); and importantly
are part o f a well-developed and broadly supported regional strategy.

* The low-case allocation for the IDA-eligible countries i s comprised o f US$4mn per country plus an additional amount o f US$3.8 mn
per IDA-eligible country from the regional IDA allocation for two regional projects (see para. 132).
135. The Country Financing Parameters for the Eastem Caribbean States were established in October
2004 and were reviewed during preparation o f this CAS. The situation since they were established remain
broadly the same, and hence no changes are being made to the parameters. The parameters are set out in
Appendix 3.
136. Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation. Timely data collection and their accuracy in the OECS
remains a problem, not least because o f human resource constraint. This makes i t difficult for results-based
monitoring and evaluation. Two activities supported by the Bank and the sub-region’s major donors are
expected to improve data collection and analysis. The OECS-MECOVI project i s expected to improve social
statistics and CARTAC i s expected to further improve macroeconomic data and policy discussions. Appendix
2 D provides a framework for the results-based monitoring and evaluation but a more comprehensive results
framework would be developed during the CAS Progress Report and as each project i s developed. For all new
operations, the Bank w i l l collect baseline data and put in place a results-based monitoring and evaluation
system in each country.

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)
137.
During 2003-2005, the Bank prepared a comprehensive series o f analytical studies related to fiscal
and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and social
protection. The ongoing dissemination o f these reports represents a key instrument for policy dialogue with
the OECS Governments on the country’s development priorities and the Bank’s assistance strategy, and i s
intended to build broad ownership for economic and social reforms.

The AAA covered by this CAS w i l l address issues o f economic growth and vulnerabilities, and w i l l
138.
provide valuable input to the policy dialogue linked with the lending program. New AAA would be o f a
regional nature to capture economies o f scale in the preparation o f analytical studies and to strategically
support greater sub-regional integration and coordination efforts in the focus areas o f the two pillars. The
A4.A w i l l be o f two types: formal and informal. A brief account o f each study i s provided below. Partnership
with other donors, including the CDB, DFID, C I D A and the EU, in the preparation o f AAA w i l l be sought.
Discussions with a number of development partners to this effect are ongoing to avoid duplication, maximize
the use o f available technical and financial resources, and build consensus around critical policy issues.
An OECS policy-note on Skills Development and Enhancement will be prepared in FY06 to examine
139.
the determinants o f education quality and relevance, focusing in particular o n the disconnect between labor
markets and educational content offered at secondary and post-secondary levels. The broad thrust o f the note
would be to (i)
assess the relevance o f the curricula for general secondary and post-secondary vocational
education in the OECS countries to the needs o f a modern and competitive economy; (ii)
examine the
potential for increasing public-private partnerships in vocational educatiodskill training, drawing from
international best practice models (e.g. Malaysia, Colombia, Chile); and (iii)
outline the policy implications
for shif’ting the currently supply-driven, publicly dominated provider system to a more demand-driven system
with greater private sector involvement. The findings o f this note would feed into a Caribbean-wide report on
Curriculum Reform and Quality Improvement (FY07).
140. To help create a positive enabling environment for private sector driven growth, FIAS recently
completed a Diagnostic Review o f the Investment Climate for Grenada which provided policy
recommendations as an input to the recently completed study on growth and competitiveness issues in the
OECS. Similar analyses for the other OECS countries could be undertaken by FIAS at the request of
Governments as an input to their growth and competitiveness strategies. An OECS Country Fiduciary
Assessment (CFA) w i l l be undertaken (FY07) to review progress in public financial management and
procurement reform and to identify remaining issues to be addressed.
Given the vulnerabilities of the OECS countries, the Bank w i l l continue the informal monitoring of
141.
macroeconomic developments. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue its ongoing support (through the M E C O V I
IDF grant) and provide additional TA for improved collection and analysis o f household survey and poverty
data to underpin poverty reduction and social development strategies. The Bank w i l l also undertake just-intime policy notes to follow-up o n specific findings and recommendations o f the studies undertaken during the
CAS period and other issues jointly identified with the authorities. Dissemination o f key analytical work w i l l
be ensured during the CAS period to build wide and strong ownership for firther structural reforms. In
addition, the Bank w i l l intensify its support in the areas o f project and financial management, and
procurement.

management and procurement).

142.
Inaddition to the country specific analytical work, the OECS countries w i l l benefit from ongoing and
planned regional studies. A Caribbean regional study on Crime, Violence and Exclusion would focus on the
impact o f crime o n poverty, social cohesion, tourism, investment and migration. This would be a multisectoral endeavor aimed at developing recommendations that would build o n the work done in FY03 on youth
and development issues in the Caribbean. The Bank i s also currently developing a Social Protection Strategy
Review paper for the Caribbean, which w i l l include a focus o n the OECS countries. The objective o f the
strategy i s to strengthen the Bank's ability to support clients on social protection through: (i)better
understanding the key socio-economic risks, existing country-level social protection programs, coverage and
implementation gaps, and outstanding country-level needs; (ii)stronger coordination with country
counterparts and donors; and (iii)
more strategic emphasis on the Bank's comparative advantage in the region.

The proposed FY08 Pension Reform AAA w i l l take an in-depth look at social insurance programs in
143.
the Caribbean, focusing in particular on reforms that would be needed to address the challenges o f limited
coverage, increasing dependency ratios and fiscal sustainability: this study w i l l be a joint deliverable o f the
Human Development (HD) and Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Sector staff,
144.
Potential areas covered by the study on Air Transport Rationalization (FY06) could address (i)an
analysis o f regional air transport routes (external, intemal) and classification o f their commercial viability; (ii)
an evaluation o f the current air service arrangements and assessment o f the extent national flag carriers are
liabilities vs. assets; (iii)
the feasibility o f entering into "open skies" arrangements for commercially viable
routes and assessment of likely impact on prices and service; (iv) an evaluation o f least-cost means to assure
adequate "social services" via least subsidy bidding or other means; and (v) an assessment o f the impact of
direct and indirect taxation on extent o f competition and service.

37

145.
Other regional studies envisaged over the period o f this CAS include a review o f economic
developments in infrastructure, health financing, financial sector and regulation.

146. Established in 2001 and supported by various donors, including the World Bank, the IMF-managed
Caribbean Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) i s a regional resource, based in Barbados, which provides
technical assistance and training in four core areas o f economic and financial management at the request o f its
participating countries: public finance management; tadcustoms policy and administration; financial sector
regulation and supervision; and economic and financial statistics. The OECS countries have benefited
significantly from this program, accounting for more than half o f the total training offered. The Bank will
sustain its support o f CARTAC through the FY06-09 period, with an JDF grant o f US$1 million approved in
FY05.
BOX 7: INNOVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SMALL COUNTRIES:
THE PROPOSED SMALL COUNTRY UMBRELLA PROGRAM (SCUP)36

The proposed Small Country Umbrella Program (SCUP) has been developed in response to the unique demands of
small countries for the Bank to modernize its approach to development and to simplify and accelerate the
disbursement o f Bank financing. The objective of the SCUP i s to keep the procedures simple, the fiduciary risks low
and the processing time below three months. Thus, the projects and activities to be financed under this instrument
would be relatively small, simple to procure and not trigger complex safeguard measures.

The model for this new instrument for investment operations for small states would allow countries to borrow small
amounts (up to U S $5 million) for projects through a procedure comparable to obtaining a mortgage loan in the USA.
Governments would be able to apply for small loans/credits under an umbrellaprogram. I t i s anticipated that once
the umbrella program has been approved, drill-down operations would be approved on a non-objectionbasis or
through delegated authority to the RegionalVice-president. Allowing the Board to approve the operations on a noobjection basis or through similar delegation would greatly speed the process of resource disbursement.
There would be two approaches to implementingthis umbrella program: (i)
through a multi-sector country program
(i.e. one umbrella programfor several sectors in one country); and (ii)
through a one-sector multi-country program
(i.e. one sector in several countries or a simplified horizontal APL). The SCUP operations- defmed by the CAS’
objectives- would allow the relevant small country authorities to simplify the applicationprocess to finance projects.
Countries’ elibility for the proposed SCUP would be part o f the CAS envelope detailed in Table 8 and stringently
linked to the overall lending triggers outlined in Table 9.

IFC
147.
IFC’s strategy w i l l be to support projects which w i l l enhance the competitiveness o f the OECS
economies helping them meet the challenges o f globalization, especially trade liberalization, focusing on
environmentally sustainable business practices and improving standards o f corporate governance. IFC w i l l
seek to finance and partner with those companies able to diversify the region’s sources o f growth, further
regional economic integration (including with the bigger island economies such as Barbados, Trinidad and
Tobago, and Jamaica), and develop linkages with the smaller locally based island businesses. Some o f the
sectors o f focus w i l l entail: (i)
the financial sector (corporate finance, financial services, insurance) with
emphasis on operations with a capacity to mobilize fimds from the larger island economies and receptive to
creative approaches to reach out to the smaller locally based business operators (MSMEs); (ii)
infrastructure,
favoring Public-Private Partnerships, together with the Bank, to facilitate the leveraging o f the larger
economies to address some o f the key issues related to power, water and wastewater, transport and logistics;
(iii)
services (IT, tourism) through corporate finance deals by the expansion o f the larger corporations active
elsewhere in the Caribbean, and seeking to better leverage the OECS location and language with respect to the
U S market, and with a priority to clients interested in developing linkages with the local economy (e.g. tourist
operators with agro/food processing suppliers); (iv) health and education, notably to address the labor s k i l l s
shortages, and support the effective delivery o f health services. Catastrophic risk insurance i s another area o f
focus where IFC will be working together with the Bank.
___

36 Work on the proposed SCUP was funded by an award from the President’s Simplification Fund and recently approved
for further development by senior management. Final adoption will be contingent upon Executive Board approval.

38

148.
Given the particular issues and constraints faced by island economies (critical mass, collateral), IFC
very often cannot finance stand alone projects. This i s especially true for tourism and agribusiness projects, as
i t i s difficult to mitigate the commercial risks associated for example with stand-alone Greenfield hotel
projects, The availability o f grant financing by notably European donors provides an opportunity to develop
some funding mechanism through which donor monies could be used to share/layer the commercial risk, and
thereby facilitate IFC’s financing. The ability to structure effective risk sharing structures w i l l be key to
IFC’s ability to support private sector development in the OECS countries.
149.
IFC w i l l also seek to partner with donors to continue its non-investment activities, for example to
maximize the impact o f the SME toolkit, or to provide the necessary business skills to MSMEs. Advisory
Services i s another IFC product which could assist in addressing some o f the regulatory issues in
infrastructure, complementing PPIAF support.

MIGA
150.
MIGA’s involvement in the OECS region has primarily been through technical assistance in FDI
attraction and the agency i s scheduled to undertake a benchmarking exercise in FY06. MIGA has marketed
its guarantee projects to foreign investors in the region. Past requests for guarantees have been mostly related
to infrastructure investments, although no contract o f guarantee has been signed to date. MIGA w i l l continue
to review requests at the regional or country levels as they arise. Currently the agency does not have any
active technical assistance programs.

15 1. Under the Global Enterprise Benchmarking Program, MIGA i s planning to conduct a benchmarking
exercise o f the Eastern Caribbean States in FY06, to be funded by the Commonwealth Secretariat (Eastern
Caribbean region), which has committed and remitted to MIGA a grant contribution o f $75,000. The
benchmarking exercise w i l l focus on the investors perspective and w i l l give the participating countries a
comparative view o f their competitiveness vis-a-vis FDI. The recently completed Asia benchmarking study
provides an example (http://www,miga,org/screens/pubsroenchmark/asiareport.pdf)o f the format and depth o f
analysis. MIGA’s on-line investment promotion services (www.fdixchange.com and www.ipanet.net) feature
over 160 documents on investment opportunities and the related legal and regulatory environment in the
OECS countries.
FIAS conducted a Diagnostic Review o f the Investment Climate for Grenada in early 2004 and there
152.
i s a possibility i t may undertake similar reviews in other OECS countries.

Managing Risks
153.
As highlighted in the previous CAS, there are two key external factors which pose the greatest r i s k to
the successful implementation o f the proposed strategy: (i)
natural disasters - as outlined earlier, the OECS
islands remain vulnerable to weather-related shocks such as hurricanes, tropical storms and earthquakes which
could cause significant damage, as witnessed most recently in Grenada. While the Catastrophe Risk insurance
project seeks to mitigate against the public sector portion o f the economic burden from such events, there i s a
risk that a natural catastrophe occurs prior to the project’s effectiveness thus necessitating additional
assistance. Weather related shocks also have a spillover effect o n critical sectors such as tourism and
agriculture; (ii)
Given their strong reliance on the rest o f the world, particularly for commodities (both imports
and exports) and service industries such as tourism, the sub-region i s susceptible to other external shocks such
as an increase in o i l prices, interest rate increases or a further expansion o f the tourism sector in Cuba and
other competing destinations. While difficult to mitigate, the strategy seeks to manage these risks through i t s
main focus on reducing vulnerabilities and support for economic diversification and fiscal prudence.
154.
A t the country level, Dominica has an ongoing issue to resolve with regard to an outstanding negative
pledge. The Government has taken significant steps to clarify and resolve the situation. The lien over
Dominica’s public assets has limited impact on IBRD debt servicing. The Bank believes that this issue can be
resolved satisfactorily.
155.
Within the OECS sub-region itself, a major risk i s the potential deterioration o f the macro situation,
which could be potentially triggered in the event o f any number o f exogenous shocks as outlined above, or in
the case o f policy slippage. The continued build up of imbalances could impose difficulties for the
management o f the currency union, which has i t s cornerstone in fiscal discipline. The triggers for the
proposed CAS lending reflect the need for restoring fiscal balances and reducing debt to sustainable levels.
The high debt levels necessitate the leveraging o f concessional funding to the extent possible and IBRD

39

lending i s only envisaged after satisfactory progress has been made to improve fiscal and debt sustainability.
In essence, half o f the potential new pipeline in the high case lending scenario hinges upon addressing this
lack o f creditworthiness.

156.
A hrther potential risk lies in the region’s weak capacity to subordinate national sovereignty interests
to regional priorities. The benefits o f multi-country approaches can only accrue if there i s political w i l l to
empower regional institutions. Similarly, the lack o f Government commitment to enact social and economic
transformations that these small economies require to a changing external environment also presents a
challenge. There i s a risk that OECS countries w i l l opt out o f a Bank assistance strategy altogether and turn to
other sources o f support. The rigorous triggers, while sending a strong message o f “ongoing support under
reformed circumstances”, may render the Bank’s assistance politically unpalatable for some countries, which
would have an impact on the regional projects being proposed. A sustained program o f communications,
dialogue, and empowerment o f change agents in the region w i l l help mitigate these risks.

157. Finally, at the level o f project implementation, without a comprehensive training and knowledge
sharing effort, the development effectiveness o f the proposed projects w i l l be hampered by the current weak
capacity in all areas of project management. The proposed OECS Capacity Building Program w i l l address
these weaknesses.

Countries:

The Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region

Date of CAS: June 4,2001

Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY02 - FY05
CAS Completion Report completed by: Tribhuwan Narain (Consultant) and K e v i n Tomlinson
Date: March 13,2005
Introduction

1.
The CAS Completion Report (CCR) reviews the experience in implementing the Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region, which was presented to the Board in June
2001 and covered the period July 2001 to June 2006. Barbados was included in this CAS exceptionally to
allow the country to participate in a Bank-supported program o f HIV/AIDS prevention and control across in
the Caribbean region. The focus o f this Report i s on the five OECS borrowing member countries Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The other OECS
Bank member, Antigua and Barbuda, has never borrowed from the Bank although recently i t has expressed
an interest in the Bank’s assistance. O f these, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines are IDNIBRD (50:50) blend countries.
2.

The CCR reflects, to a large extent, the OECS Country Program Quality Enhancement Review
completed by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Panel in December 2004. The Panel reviewed 17
lending operation^^^, including two on-going operations from the previous CAS, and eight A A A s ~The
~
Panel review covered 75 percent o f the 20 projects approved under the current CAS. The reviews were
followed b y extensive interviews o f Bank staff and management; government officials and other stakeholders
as well as key donor representatives.

3.

This CCR concludes that while the Bank has contributed only about 10 percent o f total
disbursements to the OECS sub-region, i t s contributions were significant to the sub-region’s development.
Specifically, the greatest impact has been achieved in interventions involving policy reforms as was the case
for the Dominica ERSO and ECTEL projects. The ERSO sought to restore fiscal balance and encourage a
resumption o f growth, and was approved in response to emerging country needs; the ECTEL project--which
was an ongoing project from the last CAS-was successful in dismantling a crippling telecommunications
monopoly and established a regulatory framework, leading to improved services and lower prices. In the
area o f AAA, the Bank’s analytical rigor and policy advice are also widely acknowledged as useful by key
stakeholders across the sub-region, although i t was suggested that shorter, more timely policy notes would be
more appreciated because o f capacity constraints in the OECS, and because o f the need for more timely
analysis.

4.

This Report i s organized as follows. Section A reviews the OECS’ development goals and their
relation to the Bank CAS objectives. Section B reviews CAS outcomes to the extent that available data and
other information permit. Section C reviews Bank’s performance in delivering this assistance, including an
analysis o f portfolio performance. Section D discusses consultation and coordination with other donors.
Section E summarizes the lessons learned to inform the preparation o f the new CAS. Annex 1 contains the
CAS Results Summary Matrix, Annexes 2 and 3 provide information on planned and non-programmed
projects and AAA services and actual deliveries respectively.

38 The 17 lending operations consisted o f two OECS-wide projects (telecom reform and protected areas and associated iivelihood),
one in Dominica (emergency recovery project), four in Grenada (HIVIAIDS prevention and control, education development, disaster
risk management, and emergency recovery), three i n St. Kitts and Nevis (HIV/AIDS prevention and control, education, and
emergency recovery), five in St. Lucia (water sector reform, disaster risk management 11, emergency recovery, education and poverty
reduction fund), and two in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (disaster risk management and economic recovery).
39 The QAG Panel reviewed the following AAAs: OECS CFA, OECS Environmental Management, Grenada and Dominica Analysis
o f Fiscal Issues, OECS FSAP and Dominica CFA, CPAR and Social Protection Study.

A.

OECS’ Development Goals and Bank CAS Objectives

5.
The 2001-2006 Bank CAS for the Eastem Caribbean benefited from the articulation o f long-term
development objectives, formulated by the two key sub-regional organizations, the OECS Secretariat and the
ECCB. Building o n their worPO--whichhad followed a participatory process over an 18-month period
involving the Governments, parliaments, the private sector, civil society groups, the media, donors and other
stakeholders in all OECS countries--the Bank developed its assistance strategy, itself employing an extensive
consultative approach to underscore country ownership. Other inputs to the development o f the CAS
included the country Medium Term Economic Strategy Papers, the Small States Task Force Report, and a
broad range o f analytical work undertaken for the 1998 and 2000 CGCED meetings. The emergent CAS
sought to build on these consultations and to avoid duplication with other planned or ongoing efforts by other
development partners: i t sought to focus on areas o f Bank expertise and comparative advantage

6.
Aligning itself with sub-regional development goals, the Bank’s CAS for the Eastern Caribbean had
two pillars: (i)
to support reduced income insecurity and vulnerability at the aggregate and household levels;
and (ii)
to support building human and institutional capacity. The six key OECS’ development objectives
(country goals), identified in the CAS, are juxtaposed with the CAS objectives in Table 1.
B. CAS Outcomes

7.
Neither the CAS nor the OECS’ development objectives made an explicit link to the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), but the objectives overlapped with MDG targets. Overall, the social indicators
in the OECS are strong and almost all o f the major MDGs have been met. Nevertheless, the impressive
social development gains made in the past 30 years now risk being eroded by the current challenging fiscal
and debt situations (see below) and by the economic transformation that may be required to adapt to the
changing extemal environment. Signs o f the erosion are already emerging in the shape o f rising poverty in
both rural and urban areas, disenfranchised youth and high unemployment, and a corresponding increase in
crime.

The document prepared by the OECS Secretariat and the ECCB that informed the 2001 CAS was further revised and the OECS
member states ratified i t as the OECS Development Charter i n October 2002.

OECS’ Development Goals

CAS Objectives

Enhance economic cooperation and
macroeconomic stability through concerted
action on trade and sound fiscal and monetary
policies, focusing in the short to medium term
on improving fiscal discipline and public
savings.
Increase private sector-led economic growth
and diversification, including through direct
support to the private sector, and indirect
support for growth through improved financial
services, infrastructure and maintenance o f the
environmental heritage.
Reduce vulnerability to natural phenomena
through better disaster information, mitigation

Foster a favorable macroeconomic environment with a focus on
economic stability and growth, and vulnerability measures.

Develop human capital through continued
investments in better quality health and
education, especially improved access to
secondary and tertiary education.
Address pressing social issues, particularly
chronic unemployment and problems
associated with youth.
Build greater organizational capacity, through
public sector reform, sub-regional integration,
better aid coordination and private sector

Foster human development with a focus o n education, health, and
social issues,

Support economic diversification with a focus on the financial
sector, infrastructure, environmental management, disaster risk
management, and agricultural diversification.

Foster institutional development through addressing public sector
management and strategic aid coordination issues.

8.
The OECS sub-region made substantial progress towards achieving a number o f key goals, despite
the fact that, during the period o f the last CAS, economic indicators have deteriorated and all six countries
(including Antigua and Barbuda) are among the top fifteen o f the world’s most indebted emerging market
countries in relation to their respective GDP. This conclusion i s based on reviews o f CAS outcomes and
their likely impact o n the OECS’ development goals:
0

To support the OECS goal of enhanced economic cooperation and macroeconomic stability, the CAS
focused onfostering a favorable macroeconomic environment.
o

In the CAS, direct operations to achieve the stability and growth objectives were few, However, the
Bank responded in a timely and appropriate manner to support the sub-region in coping and
adjusting with external shocks in the early 2000s. In particular, previously unplanned Emergency
Recovery Projects (ERP) (Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines) were approved in FY02 to help the sub-region cope with higher security concerns and
the impact o f the reversal in tourism following the events o f September 11 2001. The Dominica
ERP closed with satisfactory ratings and the other four w i l l close at the end o f 2005. These other
projects currently have satisfactory ratings for the two development effectiveness indicators achievement o f development objectives and implementation progress. In addition, the Bank
delivered two other previously unplanned operations to meet emergency needs in the OECS - the
Dominica ERSO in FY04 and the Grenada Hurricane Ivan emergency recovery in FY05.
Noteworthy in the first instance was the Bank’s participation with other multilateral and key bilateral
agencies in policy dialogue and support for structural reforms in Dominica, a timely but previously
unplanned Bank response to client needs. In the case o f the support provided to Grenada, funding
was available in a Contingent Facility o f the original disaster risk management projects (see below).
Finally, the Bank provided, as planned, a water sector technical assistance loan in FY02 to St. Lucia

44

and proceeded with the preparation o f a follow-up operation in FY05 to introduce private sector
participation and to address critical water sector needs in the country.

In terms o f outcomes, macroeconomic stability (fiscal deficit and debt ratios) worsened during the
period. A deteriorating trend was exacerbated in the early 2000s by a number o f negative external
shocks (natural disasters, the 9/11 events, the slowdown in the global economy, o i l price increases
and eroding trade preferences). The OECS governments sought to offset the slowdown and sustain
employment as well as meet the financing requirements through expansionary fiscal policies, mainly
financed through increased public investments funded with domestic and external borrowing on
commercial terms. The large fiscal and debt imbalances are now further dampening growth and
private investment.
Although some countries are exercising increased fiscal discipline,
comprehensive adjustment policies with a multi-faceted approach to address the excessive debt
overhang would need to be taken. In Dominica, the Government i s already implementing such a
strategy with support from the Bank, the other multilateral organizations and bilateral agencies. In
Grenada, the authorities have recently announced plans for a comprehensive debt restructuring
package. Antigua and Barbuda has announced an ambitious fiscal reform agenda including civil
service retrenchments and the reintroduction o f a personal income tax; and St. Kitts and Nevis has
announced the closure o f the sugar state-owned company which w i l l ease fiscal pressure.
In particular, the real GDP growth in the OECS was -1.5 percent in 2001. The economy rebounded
the next years to 0.7, 3.4, and 3.2 percent during 2002-2004. Together with a global upturn in
economic growth, the economies o f the OECS are projected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2005. Also,
the overall fiscal deficit has improved from 10.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a deficit o f 4.9 in 2004,
with a projected deficit o f 7.1 percent in 2005. Despite gains in terms o f restoration o f growth, debt
continued to rise as a result o f expansionary fiscal policies. The current pace o f fiscal consolidation
has been insufficient to reverse the massive buildup o f public debt (reachmg 106 percent o f GDP at
end-2004 compared with 83 percent in 2000).

Over the course o f the CAS period, the Bank produced a wealth o f AAA, much o f it pan-Caribbean
in nature, in addition to a number o f both sub-regional and country-specific studies. Notable among
these was the FY05 OECS growth and competitiveness study, “Towards a New Agenda for Growth”
which was broadly disseminated across the region to a wide and diverse range o f stakeholders. This
work has already fostered a dialogue around potential new sources o f growth in the sub-region and
key factors supporting growth have been reflected in the new CAS. Other donors, notably the
European Union, have already expressed an interest in using a number o f the recommendations of
this study as the basis for EU programming in the sub-region. A Caribbean Economic Overview was
produced and presented in FY02 to the last CGCED organized by the Bank (responsibility for this
event has since been transferred to the CDB, which has renamed i t the Caribbean Forum for
Development (CFD)). A Diagnostic Review o f the Investment Climate for Grenada was completed
just prior to the devastation o f Hurricane Ivan. In addition, all five planned public expenditure
reviews were completed during FY04 and FY05, albeit with delays to the anticipated schedule.
These documents are rich in analysis and the authorities could benefit from the analysis at a time o f
emerging macroeconomic imbalance and should use these reports as an input for widespread
discussion on policy options going forward.
Overall, although i t i s difficult to measure in any tangible way the outcome o f AAA services in any
precise way, the Q A G Panel mentioned earlier noted the Bank’s analytical work occupies a special
leadership position in the OECS countries because the governments’ own analytical capacity i s
limited, and because most donors also tend to rely heavily o n the Bank. Key stakeholders shared the
view with the Q A G Panel that the Bank’s AAA services are supportive o f the policy dialogue with
the countries and provide a useful input into the policy agenda.

The objectives focusing on vulnerability measures were not fully achieved in the current CAS period
but are expected to be achieved in the next CAS period. The Bank approved an IDF grant in FY02
for the OECS-MECOVI as Bank’s contribution to a sub-regional initiative, Support Program for
Poverty Assessment and Reduction for the Caribbean (SPARC). It became effective in early FY2004
and agreed analytical work i s under way including a training workshop in April 2005 on living
condition surveys and poverty analysis. However, the planned poverty assessments for Dominica, St.

45

Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia were not undertaken. Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
poverty assessments were to be undertaken in FY06. In order to avoid unnecessary duplication and
to promote donor coordination, the Bank took the decision to support having CDB take the lead on
poverty assessment work with financial support from DFID.

To support the twin OECS development objectives of (i)
increasing private sector-led economic growth
and diversijkation and (ii) reducing vulnerability to natural phenomena, the CASfocused on support for
economic diversiJication:
o

The Jinancial sector objective o f a joint Bank-Fund FSAP was achieved in FY04. The report
highlighted a number o f emerging risks, including the impact that central government fiscal
pressures are likely to have on indigenous banks. Several o f these banks are highly exposed to their
local public sector, and the rapid build-up in government borrowings in some countries, combined
with sizable domestic arrears by these governments, raises a key concern that, if the current situation
continues or deteriorates, the central bank may be called upon to meet a liquidity need attributable to
government arrears. W h i l e the central bank handles monetary policy, prudential regulation and
market development, the fiscal policy i s set by countries independently. The central bank has revised
its prudential guidelines on capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and corporate governance
standards in line with some o f the recommendations o f the FSAP report. Other areas o f the report
w i l l need to be enacted by the individual governments, including uniform banking law and
supervision o f off-shore banks. Although the financial sector strengthening loan, programmed for
FY05, has not materialized, informal policy dialogue continues with central bank officials and i s
centered on FSAP findings.

o

The infrastructure objectives were substantially achieved in telecommunication and progress in other
areas are expected in the next CAS period. Testament to the success o f the first project, which
established the world's first regional telcommunications regulatory agency, a follow-on project was
approved in FY05. The first project helped liberalize the sector, increasing network capacity and
competition among operators. As a result, telecommunication density increased significantly and
caused prices to drop for most services. For example, average prices for calls from the region to the
United States have been reduced by more than 70 percent since the start o f the liberalization process.
This fiscal year, the Water Sector Reform project has produced a sector law, sector investment
program, and a PSD strategy that will lead to the region's first public-private partnership in water.
T o buttress the upcoming transaction, the Bank also passed a Water Supply Infrastructure
Improvement Project. The investments w i l l double the off-take from the nation's main water supply
source to relieve water shortages throughout the north o f St. Lucia.

o

Similarly, with Bank support, Dominica i s actively pursuing an electricity sector reform program to
improve the regulatory environment. The full extent o f these reforms could be scaled up
significantly by rolling-them out to the other countries in a manner similar to that adopted for
telecommunication regulation.

o

The environmental management objectives o f consolidating legal, institutional, and regulatory
frameworks in the OECS have not been achieved. The environment study, which was ultimately
refocused as a study o n environmentally sustainable tourism, was completed in FY05, one year later
than originally planned. The analytical report was discussed with the governments and widely
disseminated to other key stakeholders including hoteliers, cruise-ship operators and environmental
NGOs. I t i s expected that the report's findings will inform future support in environmental
management. In addition, the GEF project on protected areas was also approved in FY05 but has
only just started disbursements. Given the importance o f tourism in the sub-region -- accounting for
29 percent o f GDP, 39 percent o f employment and 54 percent o f export earnings -- the Bank needs to
remain engaged in the area o f environmental management.

o

The disaster risk management objectives have been substantially met, although the catastrophe risk
insurance project, which was planned for FY03, did not materialize because o f the lack o f a critical
mass o f participating countries at the time. The Bank delivered two disaster risk management
projects: in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as planned in FY02, and in St. Lucia in FY04, two years
ahead o f the original plan. Grenada already had a project on-going in 2001. Overall, all three
projects under implementation have satisfactory development effectiveness indicators and are

46

examples o f good practice both in terms o f technical expertise the Bank can provide as well as the
close accompaniment by Bank staff during implementation to provide support to weak
implementation units in the countries. During the recent devastation by Hurricane Ivan in Grenada,
the only t w o secondary schools on the island that withstood i t s impact were both built under this
project, Given the recent natural disasters (including hurricanes, earthquakes and tropical storms,
there i s now renewed interest across the wider Caribbean, including the OECS, for a catastrophe risk
insurance program, and the Bank has been asked by CARICOM to take the lead in preparing such a
multi-country operation . All Caribbean countries are also expected to benefit from the GEF project
on adaptation to climate change, approved in FY03, and still in its early stages o f implementation.

In the agricultural diversiJication objectives the Bank did not participate directly as FA0 and EU
have taken the lead in this area. The Bank has, however, continued to remain engaged with clients
and donors on those areas relating to agricultural diversification, particularly the area o f social
protection.

To support the twin OECS’ development goals of (i) human capital development and (ii) addressing
pressing social issues, the CASfocus was to foster human development:
o

The education sector objectives o f building on previous projects have not been fully achieved but are
expected to be achieved during the next CAS period. The Bank delivered, on time, three education
projects (Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia) in FY03, and, with a one year delay, in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (FY04). The programmed education project for Dominica did not
materialize as the country focused instead on stabilization and structural adjustments with support
from the Bank and others. The education projects were developed and rolled out as part o f a
horizontal APL. All four approved projects are expected to achieve their development objectives but
progress in implementation o f the St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis projects has been marginally
satisfactory. Disbursements have been particularly low given that the average age o f the projects i s
2.5 years. As o f July 2005, disbursements were 6 percent in St. Lucia, 7.5 percent in Grenada, 22
percent in St. Kitts and Nevis, and 5 percent in St. Vincent and the Grenadines which i s the youngest
project in the education portfolio having only become effective recently. The low disbursement
reflects the fact that in Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, DFID i s financing
both curricula reform and bid preparation for civil works; with Bank support focused mainly o n the
latter. W i t h the DFID project nearly completed, implementation o f the Bank components are
expected to accelerate and become satisfactory. T o expedite progress on implementation and the
achievement o f development objectives at this critical time, the team has moved from six-monthly to
three monthly schedules for implementation missions. In the case o f Grenada, a major setback was
due to the devastation o f Hurricane Ivan and the project has been retooled to address reconstruction
needs.

o

The St. Vincent and Grenadine project has benefited from an exchange o f information with St. Lucia
and St. Kitts and Nevis project management units. For this project also, the Bank collaborated and
coordinated with all other donors to discover that there had been uncoordinated duplications and
remedial action i s being taken to better centralize all donor education interventions under one
common unit. The model o f a central project implementation unit with a separate project
coordinating unit in the Finance Ministry for all World Bank projects i s being piloted in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines - Le., covering education, disaster risk management and economic recovery. A
similar approach is being implemented in Grenada, and the European Union has recently opted to
channel its funding for the education sector through a Multi-Donor Bank-administered Trust Fund.
In the area o f AAA, the Bank produced a report o n monitoring educational achievement in the
Caribbean in FY03, and its findings informed project designs in the education sector. The Bank has
also been the lead donor in spearheading the initiative to enhance s k i l l s through distance leaming
through the establishment o f the Caribbean Knowledge and Learning Network (CKLN).

o

The health sector objectives are in the process o f being achieved. W i t h the exception o f Dominica
for reasons mentioned earlier, the Bank approved HIV/AIDS projects in the other four countries.
Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis were approved in FY03, one year later than originally planned. The
St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines projects were approved in FY05. The projects were
rolled out as part of the Caribbean horizontal A P L for HIV/AIDS. The outcomes o f the projects are

47

again too soon to gauge since they are mostly at the early stages o f implementation. As o f July 2005,
the Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis projects are rated unsatisfactory for the two development
effectiveness indicators. The two projects in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are rated
as satisfactory. Disbursement rates range from 0.3 percent in St. Lucia to 6.5 percent in St. Kitts and
Nevis.
o

The social sector objectives remain unachieved but this i s difficult to ascertain given the
unavailability o f timely and comparable data on poverty incidences across the sub-region. An IDF
grant o n improving social statistics (MECOVI) was approved in FY02 and became effective in
FY04. W h i l e its implementation has been slow, the grant i s expected to lead to better social statistics
when i t i s completed in two years time. The Caribbean M E C O V I i s a multi-donor effort to make
social data available in the future. Currently, the estimate i s that a third o f the poor households
remain chronically poor; the others do not receive satisfactory incomes. Similarly, poverty estimates
range from 12 percent o f the population o f Antigua and Barbuda, to 25 percent o f that o f St. Lucia,
to 31 percent o f that o f St. Kitts and Nevis, 32 percent o f that o f Grenada, 33 percent o f that o f
Dominica, and 38 percent o f that o f St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Poverty i s prevalent in the rural
and agricultural areas and its incidence i s higher among the youth, female-headed households, and
larger families. It i s significantly linked to the unemployed and to those with low educational skills.
In terms of AAA services, the Bank delivered a Caribbean wide youth and social development in
FY02, but this did not lead to any project due to lack o f commitment from countries to borrow for
such interventions. In addition, the Bank also produced a social protection strategy for Dominica in
FY04 to provide input into the PRSP the Government i s preparing. The other planned study on
social protection and social safety net mechanisms for the OECS w i l l be delivered as a wider
Caribbean AAA in early FY06. More importantly, although the Bank intended to undertake poverty
assessments in all five borrowing member countries, when i t discovered subsequent to the CAS
approval that the CDB and DFID were jointly undertaking these assessments in the OECS, it
supported CDB’s taking the analytical lead. The St. Lucia Poverty Reduction Fund closed
successfully recently and the authorities have expressed an interest to continue with a next phase
operation.

To support OECS’ development objective of building greater organizational capacig, the CASfocus was
on fostering institutional development:
o

The public sector management objectives have not been achieved, although significant progress has
been made in Dominica since the Emergency Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) was approved in
FY04. This operation, which was not planned, i s another example o f a Bank response to emerging
client needs and has been rated as satisfactory in terms o f the two development effectiveness
indicators. The Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review was completed in FY03, one year
later than originally planned, but the five planned public sector reform operations planned for FY04
have yet to materialize. Renewed interest, however, spearheaded by the Government o f Grenada,
has meant that the Bank i s working towards preparing and approving these operations under the next
CAS. T o ensure a home-grown public sector transformation agenda, the Bank has been working
closely with sub-regional change agents--led by the ECCB- to foster development o f the reform
agenda. The Bank also delivered two other U s : re-alignment o f sub-regional development
strategy, as planned in FY02, and country financial accountability assessment, as planned in FY03.
The planned medium term economic strategies for each country in FY04 were not done as this
responsibility was transferred to the C D B as part o f the broader CFD work program.

o

The strategic aid coordination objective has been partially achieved but i s no longer under the
leadership o f the Bank. Among the donors, UNDP out o f Barbados has taken the lead in
coordinating donor activities, but in addition the OECS Secretariat now hosts and chairs OECS
donor meetings once a year. The focus o f these meetings has been on information-sharing and on
the activities o f the Secretariat itself i s o n regional projects as the individual governments have
indicated to the Secretariat that they wished to deal with the donors separately.

The CAS envisaged a lending
envelope o f US$1 10 million for a five year
period to June 2006, covering 24 projects.
By July 2005, with about 80 percent o f the
CAS period having elapsed, the Bank had
delivered 13 projects for a total o f $79.40
million. In addition, the Bank was quick to
provide timely response to the sub-region’s

projects at risk (75 percent. In FY05, this situation improved and the HIV/AIDs projects now account for
two o f the three projects at risk. Limited disbursements to date, can in part, be explained by the composition
o f the projects, o f which approximately 65 percent o f commitments are large-scale infrastructure
components, which have less o f an impact on development outcomes o f the projects. Deficiencies in the
National Tender Board processes have proven to be a bottlenecP2 to procurement and, hence disbursement,
especially for these infrastructure components. The other ‘software’ components o f the projects, which focus
on quality and capacity are progressing well, but account for a much smaller portion o f commitments and as
such are not necessarily reflected in performance indicators. I t i s also useful to acknowledge that all
HIV/AIDS programs in the region are moving slowly and a joint analysis with DFID has shown very slow
movement o f the Global Fund resources for HIVIAIDS programs. Although tender board issues are
essentially beyond the Bank’s control, the Bank w i l l continue to seek to remove bottlenecks by familiarizing
and training board members to Bank processes and fiduciary requirements. Disbursement levels are
expected to be on track within 12 to 15 months. In addition, the C M U i s undertaking a Caribbean Regionwide HIV/AIDS Review o f the individual projects and programs against their original objectives, looking at
programs available from bilateral and other multi-lateral partners: the objective i s to arrive at a coordinated
approach to tackling systemic issues within this area.

14.
Another reason - and a manifestation o f limited available institutional capacity - for implementation
delays in education and HIV/AIDS prevention and control projects has been the long delays from Board
approval to effectiveness. O f the projects approved during the CAS period, education and HIV/AIDS
prevention and control projects had a median o f 6.7 months to effectiveness, compared to 4.2 month median
for infrastructure sector projects. W h i l e these projects also had the highest policy-making support, typically
at the level o f the Prime Minister, the performance o f project teams needed to build support at the
stakeholder level has been lackluster. During the roll-out o f the CAS, start-up delays were somewhat
mitigated in infrastructure sector projects by ensuring certain criteria were in place prior to Board approval,
including: terms o f references for consultants, tender documents for works, and requests for quotation for
goods but much remains to be done. Attaching draft procurement and financial management plans to the
Minutes o f Negotiations has, however, helped to further reduce time between Board approval and
effectiveness.

A CPPR undertaken in November 2003
Supervision Intensity (US%ths per project)
highlighted the fiduciary areas o f procurement and

financial management as well as implementation Ed, and HIV/AIDs
projects
capacity as ongoing problems.
Supervision
intensity was increased, significantly for education
and health sector projects and, for FY05, significant improvements have already been seen.
16.
Despite the problem projects in the current portfolio, project ratings and flags are considered to be
realistic. Generally there are different project flags for each project in each year, indicating that identified
problems are solved on a project-by-project basis. Three projects in FY05 maintain project flags43and last
fiscal year four o f the projects are rated unsatisfactory. Due to intensified supervision efforts, however, the
portfolio has improved. The Bank recently has been working with Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St.
Lucia to consolidate their Project Management Units and Project Implementation Units into one Project
Coordinating Unit per countrqp4, an area highlighted in two previous CPPRs as a potential way to address
limited implementation capacity, particularly in the areas o f financial management and procurement.

42 Many implementation units complained about the capacity and quality o f their National Tender Boards., and that the way in which
they operated was very inefficient and exacerbated implementation delays. For example in St. Kitts and Nevis the tender process for

sick leave.

(QER) o f the OECS Country Program in December 2004 recognized that AAA i s well aligned with CAS
objectives and provides useful input into the countries’ policy agendas, while noting that both timeliness and

Benchmarking the costs for the 2001 CAS implementation against Bank norms i s difficult; the small
size, number o f countries, location and portfolio make-up make the OECS a unique case. Benchmarking the
OECS against Honduras, a country in the same region with a similar number o f projects, and Bhutan, a
country with a population only slightly larger than the combined population o f the OECS, suggests that
resources over the CAS period were tight. Lending spiked in FY04 due to the OECS protected areas GEF
project, which incurred preparation costs o f US$280 thousand.

D. Consultations and Coordination
19.
Consultations with other donors. The Bank i s the only major donor without a permanent presence in
Barbados, where most donors are based. Nevertheless, the Bank has built on i t s good relationship with the
donor community through a combination o f high level visits, audio- and video conferencing. As a result, for
example, discussion i s at an advanced stage to establish a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to be administered by the
Bank in support o f projects and programs in the sub-region. Dominica and Grenada are being considered for
pilots. The Bank i s also participating in discussions with the Barbados-based donors in order to harmonize
donor fiduciary and reporting requirements for Grenada.
20.
Aid coordination. With the evolution o f the CGCED’s scope evolved from a pledging forum to that
o f a broader development forum, the Bank’s role in aid coordination diminished over time. The Bank
continues, however, to play strategic role in support o f the OECS, notwithstanding i t s absence from
Barbados, where the majority o f donors are based. When the CGCED was first established in the 1970s, it
was chaired by the Bank and the forum was partially devoted to aid mobilization and coordination. Over
time, aid mobilization was no longer relevant but there used to be coordination among the main donors
during the CGCED meetings. From 2002, the responsibility o f organizing and chairing the CGCED has been
assumed by the CDB, which hosted the first meeting o f the renamed Caribbean Forum for Development
(CFD), i s scheduled in M a y 2005.
2 1.

Although no longer convening the CGCED, the Bank has continued a coordination role in a number
o f areas, as evidenced by three examples: First, in the first event o f i t s kind, the Bank moved quickly to
mobilize and coordinate donor support for Grenada in the aftermath o f Hurricane Ivan in late 2004. An
initial donor meeting at Bank Headquarters brought together Heads o f Development Agencies with the
Grenadian authorities and the regional and sub-regional stakeholders for a preliminary discussion on the
shorter-term reconstruction and longer-term development priorities and funding needs. This event was
followed by a Government hosted donor conference in Grenada, which raised over US$lOO million. Another
example has been the deepening dialogue between the Bank and key donors, as noted above, to leverage
donor grant funds in support o f projects and programs developed by the Bank, matching concessional
resources with Bank technical expertise. Finally, the Bank has developed, with UNDP support, a Caribbean
wide Red Book Online that provides an internet-based platform for knowledge sharing and coordination
between development partners.

51

E. Lessons L e a r n e d

22.
The preceding analysis supports the continued relevance o f the Bank’s participation in the subregion. The Bank’s ability to leverage other donor grant funds in support o f projects and programs it
prepares using the global knowledge and expertise its staff possess i s unique and highly valued by the
beneficiary and donor countries.
23.

The following lessons emerge from the implementation o f the last CAS:
0
The areas of C A S focus and the adaptation to emerging crises in the OECS, in general, and
particularly in Dominica and Grenada were appropriate. The mix of interventions
supported the objectives generally well. The next CAS will need to build on the lessons
learned from preparing horizontal APLs sequentially and, in particular, should ensure that the
benefits reaped by the Bank in preparing horizontal A P L s are accrued to the countries. In the
past CAS, this has been achieved to an extent with the St. Vincent and the Grenadines education
project as information on civil works design and bid contract samples were shared from St. Lucia
and St. Kitts and Nevis project management units. In general, however, horizontal A P L s have
not reaped the economies o f scale in capacity-building, information-sharing, and technical
expertise that had originally been envisaged. This i s in large part because the regional aspects o f
the APLs have under-performed.
0

The best results were achieved when the Bank staff closely accompanied the
implementation with country counterparts, and was able to exploit the synergies between
well sequenced analytical works, well designed operations, and to leverage trust funds and
donor activities. The experience o f disaster risk management projects and the Dominica ERSO
are examples o f positive outcomes when the projects are very closely accompanied by close
Bank staff support and supervision. The example o f St. Vincent and the Grenadines education
project shows how important it i s to coordinate with other donors to avoid wastehl duplications.
The experience o f Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are that better results
are achieved when the Bank leverages other donor funds and activities. With a growing debt
overhang in the OECS countries, the next CAS w i l l serve the sub-region well by using IDA
resources to leverage available donor grants for programs designed and implemented with Bank
expertise.

0

Creating a common project coordinating unit to handle all fiduciary aspects of different
B a n k projects and establishing a common project management unit for all donor projects
in the line ministry, together with simplification and harmonization of donor requirements
would be a significant step towards addressing the problem of capacity weaknesses in the
sub-region. Common project coordinating and management units are being piloted in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines and are expected to be the model followed in Grenada. It i s
anticipated that this w i l l partly address the perennial shortage o f skilled staff and allow for
greater synergies with other donors. Similarly, work on harmonization o f fiduciary and
reporting requirements for Grenada’s reconstruction efforts w i l l be watched closely. If this can
be achieved, i t would be worth replicating in the other countries.

0

The CAS was not realistic enough about staff availability and programming. Several
interventions programmed in the previous CAS were delivered one to three years behind
schedule. This was due to a variety o f factors, some beyond the control o f Bank team members
or management. In some cases, particularly for some analytical work, the slippage was due to
staffing and resource issues. Greater attention needs to be paid to the fact that, within the Bank,
small countries not only often have to compete with larger borrowers for the attention o f quality
staff, but demand considerable institutional support which i s very costly., Greater attention also
needs to be paid to the provision o f customized products for small countries, including more justin-time policy notes. The latter would be particularly valuable to country counterparts who are
often the sole points o f contact for a plethora o f donors and are stretched extremely thin in the
OECS.

The C A S did not focus enough on institutional development in the areas of Bank fiduciary
requirements. While individual project managers delivered training on fiduciary aspects either
in a country or across country for the same project type (e.g., disaster risk management projects),
capacity building and knowledge-sharing has been thin. Given the difficulty o f finding qualified
staff and rapid turn-over o f key staff in the country project units, the Bank should institute a
more systematic capacity development program in project management for the OECS countries
and, in this regard, should undertake a comprehensive review o f the efficacy o f Project
Management Units to ensure that capacity-building efforts are more broadly undertaken.
The O E C S countries themselves did not define their development objectives with sufficient
prioritization or with benchmarks capable of being monitored, and outcome indicators.
Although the OECS Development Charter broadly charts a way forward, i t has proved too
general to serve as an adequate framework for either leveraging regionalism or facilitating donor
co-ordination around a set o f agreed priorities. In a series o f meetings with OECS Heads o f
Government, the ECCB and the OECS Secretariat, i t has now been agreed to coordinate donor
intervention around a clear set o f priorities with attendant benchmarks and timelines.
Donor co-ordination, while improving, has been historically weak, and duplication of
programs and interventions are common. The reluctance o f OECS Heads o f Government to
give responsibility to the OECS Secretariat for coordinating donor assistance has meant that adhoc national agendas have continued to undermine the formulation and implementation o f a
strong regional agenda. Going forward, the decision to hold an annual high-level donor meeting
with the Heads o f Government w i l l facilitate donor co-ordination around agreed programs and
principles.
Given the fact that the O E C S countries are among the most highly indebted emerging
economies in the world, greater attention will need to be paid to the leveraging of available
donor grant resources. The new CAS should explore the establishment o f alternative
mechanisms, possibly Multi-Donor Trust Funds, particularly with EU involvement, to help
catalyze the considerable amount o f EU grant financing (committed but not yet disbursed)
around critical OECS priorities. Greater attention w i l l also need to be paid to working with the
IMF to mobilize donor and political support for economic reform and adjustment programs, as,
for example, was successfully undertaken in Dominica last year.
Political economy issues need special attention in small states. The fact that the planned
Public Sector Reform programs did not ultimately materialize under the CAS, highlights the
importance o f working with governments, donors and civil society on innovative approaches to
consultation and consensus-building. The recent analytical work on public sector reform which
has included public opinion polling, working with locally based change agents to build
consensus, offers a model for the future which, along with more innovative dissemination and
communication strategies, w i l l need to be addressed in the next CAS.
Finally, greater emphasis i s needed on simplified instruments and simplified processes that
address the realities of small states. The proposed SCUP would address a number o f the issues
highlighted in this Completion Report.

COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS'
The country financing parameters for the Eastern Caribbean States, set out in the table below, were
established in October 2004 and were reviewed during preparation o f t h i s CAS. The situation since they
were established remains broadly the same, and hence no changes are being made to the parameters.
However, i t should be noted that since the time that the parameters were established in October 2004,
Antigua and Barbuda has re-introduced a personal income tax. This i s not excessive or discriminatory, and
may be financed by the Bank. Antigua and Barbuda i s also considering introducing VAT and property tax
over the next year. The Bank will be review these to determine if these may be financed.

Item

Parameter

A. Cost Sharing
Limit o n the proportion o f individual up to 100
3ercent
projects costs that the Bank may
finance.
B. Recurrent Cost Financing
Any limits that would apply to the
Overall amount o f recurrent
expenditures that the Bank may

'

The Bank may finance up to 100 percent o f project costs o f

individual projects, which would also apply to grant financing.
In most individual projects, the Bank expects to continue
financing less than 100 percent o f project costs. The actual
cost-sharing percentages would be determined during the
preparation o f each project. Recurrent cost financing

relatively small in countries where the Bank has a lending
program. The Bank w i l l continue to monitor the fiscal position
and prospects o f each o f the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS)
countries, and its implications for recurrent cost financing in
these countries. In determining Bank financing o f recurrent
costs in individual projects, the Bank will take into account
sustainability issues at the sector and project levels, including s
careful consideration o f implied future budgetary outlays. In
the case o f Antigua and Barbuda, which i s not currently a B a d
borrower, should borrowing resume at a future date, the
country's fiscal and debt situation and implications for
recurrent cost financing would also be examined during projecl
appraisal.

Yes.
C. Local Cost Financing
Are the requirements for Bank
financing o f local expenditures met,
namely that:
(i) financing
requirements for the country's
development program would exceed
the public sector's own resources
(e.g., from taxation and other
revenues) and expected domestic
borrowing; and (ii)
the financing o f
foreign expenditures alone would not
enable the Bank to assist in the
financing o f individual projects.

D. Taxes and Duties
Are there any taxes and duties that
the Bank would not finance?

Explanationhtemarks

None.

The two requirements for Bank financing o f local expenditure:
are met in the Bank borrowing countries.
Therefore, the Bank can finance local costs in the proportions
needed in individual projects. In the case o f Antigua and
Barbuda, should borrowing resume at a future date, the second
criterion for local cost financing would also be examined durin
project appraisal.

Taxes in the OECS countries are neither excessive nor
discriminatory; therefore, the Bank may finance taxes and
duties associated with project expenditures. The OECS
countries are making efforts (working with the IMF and
CARTAC) to improve their tax systems, that are generally
complex, difficult to administer and non transparent. At the
project-level, the Bank would consider whether taxes and
duties constitute an excessively high share o f projects costs.

For the purpose of the country financing parameters, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) includes six countries:
Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the six independent
countries of the OECS and all members of the World Bank Group.

APPENDIX 5: OECS CAS CONSULTATIONS
Background

The preparation o f this CAS followed a continuous and detailed dialogue involving the Governments o f the
OECS, sub-regional organizations, development partners, and representatives o f civil society. The process
entailed two rounds o f consultations: ( i ) In January 2005, a meeting was held in St. George’s, Grenada,
between the six OECS Heads o f Government, the Governor of the ECCB and the Director-General o f the
OECS Secretariat and a Bank delegation comprised o f the President o f the World Bank, the Vice President
for the L A C region and the Country Director, Lead Economist and Sector Leaders o f the Caribbean Country
Management Unit. IFC’s Regional representative and the Executive Director for the Caribbean were also in
attendance; (ii)
in March 2005, during in-country consultations, the “Concept Note”, which detailed key
directions for the CAS was presented to Government and NGOs (including the private sector, civil society
and other stakeholders). In addition, the CAS preparations benefited from an extensive Country Program
Quality Enhancement Review, conducted by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group in November 2004, which
involved meetings with stakeholders, including Government and Barbados-based donors. Finally, the
Lessons Learned and new approaches presented are informed by the CPPR and supervision missions
conducted over the last two years.
The consultations in March 2005 took place as follows:
Dominica:
A meeting organized by the Ministry o f Finance, including participants representing the public
sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the private sector.
St. Kitts and Nevis:
Meeting organized by the Ministry o f Finance, including approximately a dozen participants
representing the public sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the private sector.
Inaddition: a meeting with the Governor o f the ECCB and his senior advisors was held.
St. Lucia:
A meeting, organized by the Bank’s Public Information Center, included participants representing
the public sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the private sector. A later meeting with the
Director o f Economic Affairs at the Ministry o f Finance was held.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines:
Meeting organized by the Ministry o f Planning, including participants representing the public sector,
NGOs, trade organizations, and the private sector.
Grenada:
Meeting organized by the Ministry o f Finance, including participants representing the public sector,
NGOs, trade organizations, and the private sector.
Barbados:
A meeting hosted by UNDP involving representatives from the Caribbean Development Bank,
CIDA, DFID, the European Union and USAID.
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECEIVED DURING THE CONSULTATION PROCESS

The consultations consisted o f a brief presentation by the Bank team, explaining the proposed assistance
strategy for the OECS, including lending and non-lending activities by areas o f intervention; and the
rationale for selection of these areas. This was followed by comments, questions and answers on the
proposed strategy as well as on broader issues and concerns.
Overall, the thrust and focus o f the proposed CAS was well received by stakeholders. There was engaging
discussion about the CAS and additionally a number o f areas outside o f the CAS’ scope which stakeholders
felt should be national andor regional priorities. There was, however, a degree o f skepticism about the
validity o f the consultations and a sense that input from NGOs in particular was pro-forma rather than a real
input to the country strategic planning process. NGOs impressed upon the Bank team the need for greater
inclusion in project design and implementation.

reflected the concerns put forth in the OECS Development Strategy and the countries’ Medium-Term
Economic Strategy Papers (MTESPs). Overall, the thrust o f the proposed World Bank strategy for the OECS
was endorsed by the governments, sub-regional organizations, development partners, and well accepted by
representatives o f the civil society.

ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
Population:
GNI per capita:

79,000 (2003)
US$9,950 (2004 est. Atlas methodology)

1.
Profile. Antigua and Barbuda i s a three-island economy (Redonda i s the third) which accounts for
about 25 percent o f the combined Eastern Caribbean Currency Union GDP. Antigua, the largest island, has a
dry climate and a large number o f white sand beaches. The cultivation o f sugar that started in the late 1600’s
was abandoned in 1969. Aside from tourism-the island’s most important industry-Antigua and Barbuda’s
economy depends heavily on the service sector, particularly offshore services. The unemployment rate i s
estimated at 7 percent, poverty i s estimated to be relatively low, with a headcount index o f 12 percent, but
social indicators do not reflect the high per capita income. Adult literacy attainment, for example, lags the
other OECS countries. The 2004 UNDP Human Development Report ranks Antigua 55*, out o f 174
countries.
Political Context. Independence: 1981 Next election: 2009.
In March 2004, the United Progressive Party won a landslide victory in the general elections, ending the
political dynasty o f the Bird family, which had dominated the country’s politics for more than half a century
and run a populist, non-transparent regime, during which there was a severe erosion o f governance and
policy slippage. Antigua and Barbuda i s currently not a borrowing member o f the Bank due to
creditworthiness issues and its high per capita income. I t has, however, benefited from economic and sector
work, and regional analytical work undertaken across the OECS sub-region and the wider Caribbean region,
The new administration has recently made overtures to the donor community (including the World Bank) for
assistance in the area o f macroeconomic management.

Economic Developments and Prospects. Rapid private sector-led growth in the 1980s, mainly
tourism-sector driven, gave way to public sector-led growth, accompanied by deteriorating institutions and
broad fiscal mismanagement. As in the other OECS countries, growth slowed down considerably in recent
years due to a combination o f exogenous shocks (natural disasters, the impact o f the 9/11 events on tourism
and tightened regulation o f offshore activities) and policy slippages during the two Bird (father and son)
administrations, including fiscal mismanagement and widespread governance issues. The public sector has
been used as an employer o f last resort, with the result that about 40 percent o f the labor force i s employed in
the public sector and 60 percent o f government revenues go to meet the wage bill, leaving little room for
other expenditure. The large fiscal deficits that resulted were financed through arrears to both external
creditors as well as domestic banks, suppliers and the social security system. Continued borrowing from
select institutions, both domestic and external, was secured through earmarking tax revenues to pay debt
service to creditors and through non-transparent loans (at end-2003, almost 35 percent o f revenues were
estimated to be earmarked for debt service).
Growth has strengthened since 2003 due to a rebound in tourism, but fiscal imbalances remain very large and
the debt stock i s high. The public sector debt stock in 2003 was estimated at 142 percent o f GDP (external
debt at 75 percent o f GDP). Antigua and Barbuda’s debt profile i s somewhat different from the other OECS
countries. Multilateral debt i s negligible and there i s no debt outstanding to the World Bank Group. Debt
sustainability analysis by the IMF shows that under a passive scenario, with no adjustment, the public debt
would rise to over 157 percent o f GDP by 2009. However, it i s unlikely that Antigua and Barbuda would
find the financing required by this scenario. A strong fiscal adjustment, as detailed in the attached table,
would lead to the public sector debt ratio to GDP coming down to 86 percent o f GDP by 2009. However,
this adjustment would require primary surpluses during 2007-09 in the range o f 1.5-3.5 percent o f GDP and a
comprehensive debt restructuring.

The new administration that took office in March 2004 has shown commitment to address the country’s
problems but the challenges are significant. Fiscal imbalances and the level o f external debt (including
arrears) are high. The Government announced an ambitious fiscal reform in the 2005 budget, including the
re-introduction o f a personal income tax (introduced in April 2005)-and of a modern system o f property taxes
(to become effective in January 2006), and measures to curtail the growth in expenditures, including a
significant downsizing o f the public sector, together with the establishment o f an adequate safety net. Also,
the authorities recently announced in June that a VAT w i l l be introduced in 2006. At the same time, new

72

fiscal initiatives were introduced to stimulate growth and for social objectives, thus limiting the near t e r m
improvement in the fiscal accounts.
Since fiscal adjustment alone would not be sufficient to bring debt to a manageable level, after taking office
in March 2004 the Government initiated a dialogue with creditors with a view to regularizing relations (most
loans have been in arrears for several years). A major step included an agreement with the Italian
Government to clear US$196 million (one third o f external debt) through a bullet payment o f US$18.5
million. Also, the authorities have requested assistance from donors to hire financial advisors to facilitate the
debt restructuring process. A Debt Coordinating Committee was formed in mid-2005 with representatives
from the public and private sectors to facilitate this process. Even with a large fiscal adjustment and robust
growth performance, the economy will remain vulnerable and public debt high for many years to come. In
particular, the combination o f high debt, susceptibility to external (economic and natural) shocks and a
tourism dependent economy point to an unusually high level o f risk.

Annex 1: Country Profile

DOMINICA

Population:
71,000 (2003)
GNI Per Capita: US$3,650 (2004 est. Atlas method)

1.
Profile. Dominica, the most northerly and largest o f the Windward Islands, i s predominately a lush
mountainous area with plentiful water resources, excellent for cultivating bananas, which together with other
agricultural products are the base o f the economy and its largest source o f employment. Mainstream tourism
was never developed due to the small number o f white-sand beaches, high rainfall and poor air connections;
however, given its other natural characteristics, eco-tourism i s being promoted. Agriculture i s the mainstay
of the economy and accounts for about 18 percent o f GDP, 60 percent o f total merchandise exports and
employs 40 percent o f the labor force. The unemployment rate i s estimated to be 25 percent, and the poverty
head count index i s 33 percent. Dominica ranks 95th out o f 174 countries in UNDP’s 2002 Human
Development Index.
Political Context. Independence: 1978 Next Election: before July 20 10.
2.
Dominica i s the only commonwealth member o f the OECS, and the only island with a substantial surviving
population of indigenous people, the Caribs. In May 2005, the Labour Party--which had formed a coalition
with the more conservative Dominica Freedom Party following the death o f the former Labour Party Prime
Minister--won twelve o f the twenty-one seats in Parliament, increasing its majority by two seats. The current
Government has continued the difficult economic transition begun by the previous administration.

3.

Economic Development and Challenges. Following a contraction o f the economy o f 9 percent in
2001-03 and a fiscal crisis in 2003, Dominica has made significant progress at macroeconomic adjustment
and fiscal consolidation. Despite an earthquake that struck Dominica in late 2004, the real GDP growth rate
for 2004 i s estimated at 3.5 percent, on the back o f strong performance by the banana sector, manufacturing
and construction, and resumed market confidence. With resolute implementation o f the stabilization and
structural adjustment program supported by the IMF under a three-year SDR 7.7 million Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility, an IDA adjustment credit (a US$3 million Economic Governance Reform Credit
disbursed as a single tranche in February 2004), and other donors’ technical and financial support, the fiscal
position has strengthened considerably.
The conduct o f fiscal policy has been prudent, with large savings realized above programmed amounts o n
account of stronger than expected revenues. As a result, the primary balance improved from -1.6 percent of
GDP in FY2002-03 to a surplus o f 5.6 percent in FY2003-04, and the overall fiscal balance improved from 5.4 percent o f GDP in FY2002-03 to -1.3 percent in FY2003-04, largely exceeding its -4.2 target. The
FY2004-05 primary balance and the overall fiscal balance are projected to reach 2.7 percent and -2.5 percent
of GDP, respectively. Reforms o f the tax system (through the introduction o f a VAT), the public sector,
financial management and social security are ongoing. The IMF-supported PRGF program remains on-track
with the third and fourth programs successfully completed in February 2005.

InApril 2004, as part o f its macroeconomic program, Dominica launched a debt exchange aimed at reducing
debt to a sustainable level. The debt exchange offer was closed in September 2004. Thus far, agreements (in
principle) have been reached to restructure about 70 percent o f the eligible debt. The authorities continue to
make good faith efforts to reach understandings with creditors who have not yet agreed to participate in the
restructuring, and have committed to making payments into escrow accounts on restructured terms for such
creditors. Debentures have been issued to creditors w i t h finalized agreements and payments under
restructured terms started. Taking into account the actual terms o f the agreed restructurings and assuming
that the remaining creditors w i l l accept the offered terms, the debt ratio would remain sustainable. However,
the debt trajectory i s very sensitive to the assumed economic growth rate and primary surplus (detailed in the
attached table), Furthermore, rising global interest rates present an additional vulnerability.
Under the IDA-financed Economic Governance Reform Credit, the Government implemented actions to (i)
restore fiscal stability by improving financial and debt management, and (ii)
encourage a resumption of
growth by strengthening the financial sector, improving the productivity o f public investment and improving
the climate for private investment, Government’s reform efforts for 2005 under the IMF PRGF arrangement
w i l l focus on improving the fiscal framework and public finances, and strengthening the social security and
the financial sector. Specific measures include improving the regulation and oversight o f non-bank financial

80

institutions, institutionalizing fiscal discipline through legislative amendments, and carrying out a
comprehensive review o f the pension system, jointly with the World Bank. Following the preparation o f an
Interim Poverty Reduction Support Strategy (shared with the Board o n December 11, 2003), a full Poverty
Reduction Support Strategy i s expected to be completed by the Government in the second half o f 2005.
Raising Dominica’s growth potential i s an integral element o f the strategy t o ensure fiscal and debt
sustainability and poverty reduction. In their draft PRSP, the authorities target a medium-term growth rate o f
3 percent, capitalizing on the country’s nature-based tourism opportunities and i t s potential to export geothermal electricity to the neighboring French islands o f Martinique and Guadalupe.

GRENADA
Population:
105,000 (2003)
GNI per capita: US$3,760 (2004 est. Atlas methodology)
Profile. Grenada, which includes the two smaller islands o f Carriacou and Petit Martinique, to its
1.
north, i s the southernmost o f the Windward Islands. Dubbed the “Spice Island”, Grenada was, until late
2004, the world’s second largest exporter o f nutmeg and mace. On September 7,2004, Hurricane I v a n - o n e
of the strongest storms ever to strike the Caribbean region-passed directly over Grenada, decimating the
housing stock, severely damaging the nutmeg plantations and inflicting significant damage on the tourism
sector. An Organization o f Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Secretariat assessment team estimated the
damage at US$900 million, more than 200 percent o f the 2003 GDP, two thirds o f which was housing stock.
Unemployment rates and poverty levels, already among the highest in the OECS, are expected to worsen as a
result. Prior to Hurricane Ivan, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 13 percent, and Grenada was
ranked 93rd on UNDP’s Human Development Index out o f 174 countries.

2.
Political Context. Independence: 1974 Last election: 2003
Following the Marxist military coup and subsequent U S invasion in 1983, power has fluctuated regularly
between the New National Party and New Democratic Party, with the former winning the majority o f seats
during the most recent three terms, albeit by a significantly reduced margin (one seat majority) in the most
recent elections.
3.
Economic Developments and Prospects. Prior to Hurricane Ivan, the economy was recovering
from the 2001-02 downturn that affected all the OECS countries and progress was taking place in addressing
fiscal imbalances and offshore financial sector weaknesses. Aided b y the recovering economy, the central
government primary balance improved from a deficit o f -14.5 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a surplus o f 0.4 and
3.7 percent o f GDP in 2003 and 2004, respectively. This was achieved by broadening the tax base, curtailing
tax and import duty exemptions and controlling expenditures. Public debt had increased in the late 1990s
and early 2000s, notably in 2002 owing to the purchase o f leases associated with public-private partnerships
and the granting o f guarantees. Notwithstanding the fiscal adjustment in 2003-04, total public debt at end2004 increased to 129 o f GDP.
Following Hurricane Ivan, the near-term economic outlook i s very difficult. The economy contracted by 3
percent in 2004 and i s expected to expand by only 1 percent in 2005’, with depressed conditions in tourism
and agriculture nearly offsetting the stimulus from the construction sector. Inflation has remained low,
notwithstanding large increases in input prices such as construction materials. The external current account
deficit i s expected to deteriorate sharply in 2005 (to 34 percent o f GDP), as a result o f the sharp increase in
reconstruction-related imports and slow recovery o f exports. Social conditions, already weaker than in other
OECS countries, deteriorated after Hurricane Ivan with about 8 percent o f the labor force displaced from
their jobs in the immediate aftermath o f the hurricane.

In the fiscal area, with support from the international community, the authorities were able to close the 2004
financing gap. Non-essential expenditures were reduced, donor pledges o f US$l50 million (34 percent o f
2004 GDP) were mobilized quickly at a donors conference held in October 2004 and a follow-up formal
pledging session in November 2004. An Agency for Reconstruction and Development was established in
November 2004 to coordinate domestic and international efforts to rebuild Grenada. Grenada also accessed
the IMF’s emergency assistance for natural disasters (US$4.4 million) in November 2004. The World Bank
reallocated US$lO million from existing projects to address reconstruction needs, and a firther loan o f
US$10 million (IDNIBRD) from the OECS Disaster Management Project Contingency Facility was
provided.

The 2005 budget, approved in April, includes revenue-enhancing measures yielding over 2 percent o f GDP.
Yet, the fiscal situation remains challenging and financing gaps for 2005 and beyond remain. Post-hurricane
relief and rehabilitation expenditures are required, revenues sources remain weak and the high debt levels
require setting tight limits to further borrowing. The fiscal deficit i s expected to reach 8.5 percent o f GDP in
Estimates and projections included in this and following paragraphs and in attached tables do not take into account the impact of
Hurricane Emily which passed over Grenada on July 14,2005. An assessment o f the damage i s underway b y the OECS Secretariat
(initial tentative estimates o f the damage were placed at US$107 million, or about 24 percent o f GDP, by the Ministry o f Finance,

91

2005 (and the primary balance -2.5 percent o f GDP) and, despite the Government’s revenue effort and
exceptional donor support, a financing gap estimated at about 4.5 percent o f GDP remains for 2005 due to
high reconstruction expenditures, and o f 12-14 percent o f GDP per year between 2006 and 2009. In the
absence o f debt restructuring, public debt would continue to rise, reaching nearly 144 percent o f GDP by
2009 and public debt service would range between 32 and 42 percent o f revenue in 2005-09.
For 2006 and beyond, the financing gaps could be filled through fiscal adjustment, cooperative debt
restructuring agreements and donor support. Fiscal adjustment measures could include implementing
petroleum price reform, reducing tax concessions and improving tax collection; and containing the growth o f
non-interest current spending and capital expenditure prioritization. Debt sustainability analysis by the IMF
shows that a combination o f fiscal adjustment (with a primary fiscal surplus reached by 2008 and maintained
thereafter), a comprehensive debt restructuring in 2005 and additional foreign grants would reduce the public
debt to GDP ratio gradually (to 100 percent by 2009 and below 50 percent by 2020) and make the debt
service burden more manageable (10 to 18 percent o f GDP) (see attached table). Even under this scenario,
the economy would remain vulnerable and public debt high for many years to come. In particular, the
combination o f high debt, susceptibility to external (economic and natural) shocks and a tourism dependent
economy points to an unusually high level o f risk.
The authorities recognize that a comprehensive medium-term economic program i s needed to fill financing
gaps, restore debt sustainability and ensure medium-term growth and plan to design i t with the support o f
CARTAC. Already, the authorities are designing a public sector modernization program, with assistance
from the World Bank, to enhance public sector efficiency and productivity, including through the
commercialization o f public services and improving the procurement system. With respect to debt
management, in October 2004, Grenada announced that its debt was unsustainable and that it planned to
pursue a cooperative solution with i t s creditors. Because interest payments o n two large international bonds
were missed in late December, Grenada was downgraded to “selective default’’ by Standard and Poor’s, In
January 2005, the Government hired legal and financial advisors to help in the preparation o f a
comprehensive debt reduction strategy. Pending the development and outcome o f the strategy, Grenada has
discontinued servicing most commercial and official bilateral debt obligations. In April 2005, a creditor
committee representing a majority o f the country’s commercial debt obligations was formed. A debt
exchange offer to commercial creditors i s expected to be launched in the coming months. The Government
has also approached official creditors to negotiate debt and debt-service relief on at least comparable terms.
Debt restructuring with bilateral creditors i s complicated b y the severance o f diplomatic relationship between
Grenada and its largest creditor, Taiwan, China. A successful outcome o f the debt strategy, which i s
currently being developed, could considerably narrow the financing gaps.

Annex 1: Country Profile

Population:
47,000 (2003)
GNI per capita: US$7,600 (2004 est. Atlas methodology)

1.
Profile. St. Kitts and Nevis lies in the Leeward Islands. The two islands are a federation: Nevis, the
smaller island, has a population o f 9,600, and exercises autonomy in most areas, with the exception o f
foreign, defense, and certain aspects o f economic policy. The economy i s based on tourism with a declining
share o f agriculture in St. Kitts. Unemployment i s the lowest among OECS member countries and the 2004
UNDP Human Development Index ranks St. Kitts and Nevis 3gthamong 174 countries. Despite this positive
picture, St. Kitts and Nevis has a poverty headcount index o f slightly over 31 percent based on a recent
assessment, which captures the vulnerability and the impacts o f successive hurricanes in 1998 and 1999.
Currently, St. K i t t s and Nevis i s the only IBRD-only borrower o f the OECS.
2.
Political Context: Indeoendence: 1983 Last election: 2004
The current administration, representing the St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party, was returned to office for a
third term last year. St. Kitts and Nevis i s a Federation, with a high degree o f autonomy for Nevis, which has
its own executive branch (Nevis Island Administration) and approximately one quarter o f the federation’s
population. A number o f referenda on secession from St. Kitts have been held, but have not passed.

3.
Economic Development and Prospects. Growth rates in St. Kitts and Nevis averaged 6 percent in
the 1980s and about 4 percent in the 1990s. Three major hurricanes hit the country in the late 199Os,
including two o f a catastrophic nature, Reconstruction spending and robust foreign investment in tourism
continued to fuel growth but left the two-island federation with a high debt burden and serious fiscal
imbalances. These were further exacerbated by public sector wage increases. The government has taken
measures in 2003-04 to address the fiscal deficit (which led to a reduction in the primary deficit from 11.2
percent o f GDP in 2002 to an estimated 0.5 percent in 2004, and a reduction inthe overall fiscal deficit from
18.2 percent o f GDP in 2002 to an estimated 8.5 percent in 2004), but the debt to GDP ratio remained high
(170 percent o f GDP in 2004)-the highest in the ECCU.
K e y priority actions needed to bring down the very high debt stock include the closure o f the insolvent sugar
state-owned company (SSMC)47, which absorbs about 2 percent o f GDP in subsidies each year, continued
fiscal adjustment and a debt strategy to bring debt to a more sustainable level in an orderly fashion. The
authorities have announced their decision to close the sugar state-owned company, and to put in place a
safety net to mitigate the social impact. In addition, given the high debt levels, the fiscal adjustment required
to underpin a significant debt reduction needs to be large and sustained, involving deep reforms o n both the
revenue side and civil service reform, and w i l l require sustained strong political resolve.
Debt sustainability analysis by the IMF shows that under a passive scenario, with no significant adjustment,
the public debt would rise to over 205 percent o f GDP by 2009. However, it i s unlikely that St. Kitts and
Nevis w i l l find the financing required by this scenario. A strong fiscal adjustment scenario i s detailed in the
attached table, including a combination o f revenue measures, a freeze on nominal outlays for wages and
goods and services, a cut in capital expenditure, the closure o f SSMC and the cancellation o f i t s debt in 2006
by transferring sugar lands to creditors, and privatization receipts o f 4 percent o f GDP a year during 20062009. This scenario would lead to the public debt ratio coming down to 117 percent o f GDP by 2009,
However, t h i s adjustment would require high (about 8 percent o f GDP) primary surpluses. In this respect,
other options, including a significant restructuring o f commercial debt accompanied by new borrowing at
below market rates from bilateral and multilateral sources as well as fiscal adjustment, could be explored by
the Government to reduce debt more rapidly.
Even with a large fiscal adjustment and robust growth performance, the economy would remain vulnerable
and public debt high for many years to come. In particular, the combination o f high debt, susceptibility to
external (economic and natural) shocks and a tourism dependent economy points to an unusually high level
o f risk.

The St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Company (SSMC) employs about 1,000 people (7 percent o f the labor force) and occupies
about 4,000 hectares o f land (30 percent o f the island’s surface).

Annex 1: Country Profile

ST. LUCIA
Population:
161,000 (2003)
GNI per capita: US$4,300 (2004 est. Atlas methodology)

1.
Profile. St. Lucia i s the most densely populated o f the four Windward Islands. The interior o f the
island i s mountainous, but there i s more flat land than in Dominica, Grenada or St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The soil i s generally fertile and the banana industry (and other agriculture products) makes St.
Lucia the biggest exporter o f agricultural products among the OECS member countries. The pleasant climate
and the sandy beaches have encouraged the development o f tourism, particularly in the “honeymoon sector”
which has become the main foreign exchange earner in the economy. Despite relatively strong social
indicators, the U N D P Human Development Index classifies St. Lucia as 71st out o f 174 countries. Twentyfive percent o f the population i s estimated to live below the locally defined poverty line, and 19 percent i s
estimated to be unemployed.

2.
Political Context. Independence: 1979 Last elections: 2001
The current administration, representing the St. Lucia Labour Party (SLP) was retumed to office for a second
term in December 2001, gaining 14 o f the 17 contested seats. The remaining seats were taken by the former
ruling United Workers Party. Elections are expected before the end o f next year.
3.
Economic Developments and Prospects. Like the other OECS countries, St. Lucia experienced a
marked decline in economic growth during the early 2000s, with average real GDP growth declining from an
annual average o f 2.5 percent in the 1990s to -1.3 percent during 2000-02, This marked slowdown was the
result o f exogenous shocks (the September 11 events and the global economic slowdown), the erosion o f EU
trade preferences for traditional banana exports, as well as increased competition from lower priced tourism
destinations. The contraction and slowdown in growth was accompanied by an expansionary fiscal stance
resulting in worsening primary balances (from 0.2 percent o f GDP in FY2000/01 to -5.1 percent in
FY2002/03) and rising public sector debt (from 44 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 64 percent in 2002).
The economy rebounded in FY2003/04 and FY2004/05, with a growth rate o f 3.1 and 3.7 percent,
respectively, sustained by strong performance in the tourism sector. There was significant fiscal tightening
in FY2003/04 resulting in a primary balance o f -1.0 percent o f GDP, due to higher revenue collection,
reduced capital expenditure and a pick-up in economic activity. However, the primary deficit i s estimated to
have deteriorated slightly in FY2004/05 (-1.3 percent o f GDP), due to rising capital expenditure. While the
lowest in the OECS, in 2004 public debt stood at 73 percent o f GDP. Extemal debt represents 63 percent o f
total debt. The Government has been able to access the regional capital markets on increasingly favorable
terms; this has allowed it to replace foreign with E C dollar-denominated debt with new issues at declining
spreads over U S treasury bills. Spending pressures in anticipation o f the next elections may jeopardize
progress towards fiscal consolidation and debt reduction.
The attached table presents an active policy macroeconomic scenario with medium-term growth at 3 percent
per year and fiscal adjustment over the medium-term leading to the central government primary balance
moving from a deficit o f 1.3 percent o f GDP in FY2004/05 to a surplus o f about 4.5 percent o f GDP in
FY2009/10. In this scenario, the debt stock would decline gradually to about 63 percent o f GDP by 2009.
However, a continuation o f current fiscal policies would lead to an unsustainable level o f debt, and crowdout expenditures for social and economic goals. Under this scenario, the central government primary balance
would be in the range of -2 to -8 percent o f GDP and public debt would rise to 119 percent o f GDP by 2009.
This scenario i s also subject to further downside risks-interest rate or natural disaster shocks-which would
limit the government’s flexibility at high levels o f debt.
Although St. Lucia i s the most budget reform-minded o f the OECS countries, with the most up-to-date legal
framework for public financial management, the expansionary fiscal policy conducted by the country has not
led to strong growth. Fiscal adjustment could be achieved by containing capital expenditures, reducing tax
concessions, introduction o f a broad based consumption tax, and containment o f the public sector wage bill,
Structural reforms to invigorate growth are also needed, particularly to reduce input costs and raise labor
productivity.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
Population:
109,000 (2003)
GNI per capita: US$3,650 (2004 est. Atlas methodology)

1.
Profile. St. Vincent and the Grenadines consists o f 32 islands. St Vincent, the northernmost island,
i s the country's commercial and political center, accounting for 90 percent o f both the land area and
population. The volcanic island i s lush and green, i t s deep valleys cultivated with bananas, coconuts and

arrowroot. The others belong to the Grenadines, a chain o f about 800 islets extending between St. Vincent
and Grenada, which attract a large number o f yachting tourists. St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the poorest
country among the OECS, has a poverty headcount index o f about 38 percent and an estimated
unemployment rate o f about 21 percent. St. Vincent and the Grenadines ranks 87'h out o f 174 countries on
the 2004 UNDP Human Development Index.

2.

Political Context. Independence: 1979 Last election: 200 1

The current administration, representing the Unity Labour Party won a landslide victory in the March 2001
general elections, which ended 15 years o f rule by the New Democrat Party. Parliamentary elections are due
by no later than March 2006, but it i s likely they w i l l take place in late 2005.
3.
Economic Developments and Prospects. Like the other OECS countries, the country experienced
an economic growth slowdown in the late 1990s and early 2000s. While traditionally among the most
fiscally responsible o f the OECS countries, the authorities began in the late 1990s to implement expansionary
fiscal policies to offset the economic slowdown. As a result, the fiscal situation weakened since the late
1990s, and public debt has risen rapidly since 1999, yet remains lower than the OECS average. This was
compounded by the cost o f rehabilitation expenditures to repair damage caused by a series o f weatherinduced natural disasters. Public debt rose from less than 50 percent o f GDP in 1997 to 79 percent o f GDP in
2004 (of which 32.5 percent i s domestic and 67.5 percent i s external; about 35 percent o f public debt i s to
commercial banks). This increase was in large part due to the past administration's guarantee and, in 1999,
assumption o f a large private external debt o f EC$156 million (17.5 percent o f GDP) for the construction o f
the Ottley Hall marina and shipyard. In 2001 the government obtained a moratorium on interest payments
pending a settlement with creditors (foreign commercial banks) and continues to seek a debt restructuring.
Economic activity rebounded in 2003 and 2004 as a result o f a revival o f tourism, with real GDP growth o f
3.4 and 4.3 percent respectively. A modest acceleration (4.9 percent) i s expected in 2005 on the basis of
continued expansion in tourism and tourism-related services, an increase in public sector investment and a
high level o f construction activity. Unlike neighboring Grenada, there was limited damage from Hurricane
Ivan (about 5 percent o f 2003 GDP), In fact, Grenada's demand for food, construction materials and
transport services has boosted economic activity in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
After a significant improvement in 2003, fiscal performance weakened in 2004 as a result o f slower revenue
growth. The primary balance deteriorated from a deficit o f 0.6 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 0.9 percent in
2004. The budget for 2005 reflects election spending pressures and, if fully implemented, would lead to a
deterioration in the primary balance. However, on the basis o f historical capital execution rates and existing
implementation capacity, it i s unlikely that all budgeted expenditures w i l l materialize. The external current
account deficit widened substantially in 2004 (25 percent o f GDP) as a result o f a general rise in imports,
especially o f energy products, food equipment and building materials largely related to private housing and
tourism-related investment. In 2005, the external current account deficit i s expected to deteriorate further (to
about 28 percent o f GDP) due to additional public capital expenditure and rising o i l import costs,
notwithstanding a rebound in banana export earnings. Current account imbalances continue to be largely
financed by FDI flows.
The attached table presents an active policy macroeconomic scenario with medium-term growth at 4 percent
per year and fiscal adjustment over the medium-term leading to the central government primary balance
moving from a deficit o f 0.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 to a surplus o f about 4 percent o f GDP in 2009. In this
scenario, the debt stock would decline gradually to about 71 percent o f GDP by 2009. However, a
continuation o f current fiscal policies would lead to an unsustainable level o f debt, and crowd-out
expenditures for social and economic goals. Under this scenario, the central government primary balance
would be in the range o f -1.5 to -5 percent o f GDP and public debt would rise to 95 percent o f GDP by 2009.

121

This scenario i s also subject to further downside risks-interest

rate or natural disaster shocks-which

would

Although St. Vincent and the Grenadines i s the poorest country in the OECS, it has relatively strong social
indicators, including life expectancy at birth, immunization coverage and the infant mortality rate, The
Government has recently developed a “social contract” with trade unions, the private sector and civil society
aimed at fixing the general framework for cooperation in both policy formulation and monitoring. A Poverty
Reduction Strategy also recently adopted by the Government follows a multi-faceted approach including the
promotion o f a micro-enterprise sector, new infrastructure projects in roads, airports and power plants and an
enhanced safety net for the poor through public assistance. Looking forward, it i s crucial that the authorities
focus their efforts o n strengthening the fiscal position and reducing public debt, and on accelerating
structural reforms t o promote private sector-led growth through productivity-enhancing policies, increasing
public sector efficiency and regional integration. The planned adoption o f a VAT and market valuation-based
property taxation in 2007 would be steps in the right direction. The reduction in tax concessions, control o f
the wage bill and public sector modernization, and a prioritization o f public investment projects would also
be needed to strengthen the fiscal position and increase public sector efficiency.
