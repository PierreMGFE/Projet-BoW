Gabon i s a resource-rich country with a small, highly urbanized population. The country i s wellendowed with arable land, forest and mineral resources, but o i l has been for long Gabon’s main economic
sector and the principal driving force of i t s growth. Despite the high per capita income that the o i l sector
has afforded, the country has not been able to overcome the challenges o f equitable economic
development and minimum social welfare for all. Inequality i s high, and large sections o f the population
do not have effective access to public services. While Gabon has made progress towards meeting the
Millennium Development Goals, several social indicators are s t i l l lagging. In particular, a rising
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate i s a serious concern. As the prospects for o i l decline, the situation i s expected
to worsen.
2.
Recognizing the challenges facing the country, the Government prepared an Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in June 2003, even though as an IBRD country i t was not a
requirement. Important policy actions have been taken since mid-2002, marking a significant break from
past performance and demonstrating a renewed commitment on the part of the authorities to sound
macroeconomic management. After a history of repeated slippages against IMF-supported program
targets, performance under the current Stand-By Arrangement i s on track. The Government has made
striking progress in the forest sector reform agenda, and has taken important steps towards greater
transparency in the management of o i l revenues, as evidenced notably by the recent declaration of intent
to adhere to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITJ) and work towards i t s implementation.
The combination of declining revenues and the need to improve social outcomes has been a powerful
incentive for Government to improve transparency and efficiency in the use of i t s public resources, both
natural and financial. The planned World Bank Group assistance program has been designed to support
Gabon’s efforts and to ensure that the current window of opportunity i s not lost.

3.
The present CAS takes i t s lead from the main development objectives of the Government as
highlighted in I-PRSP and the national prospective study “Gabon 2025”. The priorities o f the
to improve efficiency in the
Government over the medium term, as reflected in these documents, are: (i)
to
use o f public resources, with a focus on improving the quality and quantity of basic services; and (ii)
improve the environment for private sector-led investment in the non-oil sectors o f the economy.
Gabon’s national development strategy seeks to generate sustained growth for poverty reduction.
Following the completion o f i t s I-PRSP, Gabon has undertaken the preparation of a Growth and Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) that w i l l form the basis o f i t s future development strategy. The Bank
i s assisting Government to finalize the GPRSP.
4.

This i s the third assistance strategy the Bank’ has prepared for Gabon. The first two were
prepared in 1994 and 1998, respectively. Although the horizon of the 1998 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) did not extend beyond 2001, after that date the Bank continued to implement operations prepared
under the previous programs. The last two operations in the Bank’s portfolio, an urban development LIL
and a privatization project, closed in June 2004. The 1998 CAS embraced an ambitious agenda for
political and social reform, including significant attention to poverty alleviation. However, while some
progress was made on privatization and macroeconomic management, i t did not achieve the majority o f
the proposed CAS outcomes.

5.
This CAS sets out planned lending and non-lending World Bank Group support t o Gabon over
the period FY05-09 that i s less ambitious. Activities have been selected based on their alignment with the
Government’s objectives and the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage. Other development
partners plan lending, grant and technical support in areas that complement the Bank’s areas of
comparative advantage. The CAS i s articulated around two pillars: (1) strengthening the management of
public resources (both natural and financial) for improved social outcomes; and (2) improving the
1

The “Bank’ refers to the IBRD and IDA; the “World Bank Group” refers to the Bank, F C , FIAS and MIGA.

investment climate to foster sustainable, private sector led non-oil growth. Cross-cutting themes are
developing capacity in Government, c i v i l society, and improving governance and participation.

6.
The Bank’s base-case assistance program w i l l include three lending operations in the urban,
natural resources, and infrastructure sectors: a US$25 million Public Investment Program for Local
Infrastructure Development Project expected to be presented to the Board in June 2005, a US$15 million
Natural Resources Management Development Policy Loan for FY06, and a US$25 million Infrastructure
Project in FYO8. Each operation places emphasis on improving transparency and efficiency in use o f
public resources, including natural resources, and on improving the environment for greater participation
of the private sector. In the Base Case, the lending program planned for FY05 to FY09 thus amounts to
US$65 million, in addition to US$1.5 million which would be sought in IDF grants, and a US$10 million
GEF supporting the national Forest and Environment Sector Program (PSFE). Non-lending activities
include continuing support for GPRSP preparation (and i t s subsequent implementation), public financial
management, private sector development, civil society capacity development and a Poverty Assessment.
Currently IFC has an exposure of US$3.8 million in the o i l and gas sector, and the World Bank Group’s
Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FMS) has recently completed a diagnostic study o f the
investment climate. A US$61 million MIGA guarantee facility for rehabilitation and modernization of a
professional training institute i s expected to be presented to the Board in M a y 2005. This project i s
MIGA’s first in the education sector.
The current situation in Gabon i s considered to be the Base Case. Remaining in the Base Case
7.
would be predicated on continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance and continued progress in the
implementation of the forest reform agenda as evidenced notably by continued implementation o f the
moratorium on allocation of new permits until the new transparent auction procedures are implemented.
In the event that the country falls short of meeting the base-case criteria, a low-case scenario would be
activated which would involve no new lending and a reduced level o f AAA support.

8.
Consideration for moving to a High Case would be based on a modulated approach whereby in
the first instance a particularly good track record of performance o f reforms in the natural resource sector
would trigger presentation of a second Natural Resources Management D P L (US$10 million) for Board
consideration in FY08. Beyond this, specific actions to improve the broader investment climate would
trigger preparation o f a Diversification support operation (US$18 million) for Board presentation in
FY09. More substantial BanklIFC collaboration would also be considered.
9.

The main external risk affecting the ability of t h i s CAS to achieve i t s objectives would be a sharp
drop in petroleum prices. The main internal risk i s of a departure from good fiscal management practices.
There i s also a risk that commitment to structural reforms w i l l diminish over time and/or vested interests
w i l l succeed in preventing such reforms from being implemented. Commitment to the reform agenda i s
likely to be strengthened following elections, as the Government w i l l face less pressure to manage the
impact o f policy implementation on vested interests. A stronger role for Parliament, the private sector,
and civil society, along with a credible and well functioning law and justice sector, w i l l also help to hold
the Government accountable. Bank- and other partner-supported capacity development activities w i l l
help strengthen these roles.
The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
The appropriateness o f the two “pillars”, as defined in paragraph 6, as entry points towards
the ultimate goal o f poverty reduction; and
Whether the Bank program strikes the right balance between being realistic, as recommended
in the CASCR, and providing adequate support to address Gabon’s development priorities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sets out planned lending and non-lending World Bank
Group support to Gabon over the period FY05-09. The last CAS for Gabon was discussed by the Board
in September 1998. I t called for the Bank to transcend i t s traditional lending role and instead play the role
of a knowledge bank. Although many of the outcomes envisaged in the FY99 CAS did not materialize,
ongoing projects provided for continuity in the dialogue with Gabon. Beginning in 2003, the Bank
became more active in Gabon, and country economic performance improved. Lessons learned since
FY99, reviewed in a CAS Completion Report (CASCR) (see Annex 4), have been taken into account in
preparing the present CAS.
2.
Although Gabon i s an IBRD Borrower, i t has undertaken the preparation of a PRSP, known
locally as the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy paper or GPRSP, which w i l l form the basis o f i t s
future development strategy. Because the GPRSP i s not yet complete, the Government has not yet
established definitive monitorable development goals. Consequently, while t h i s CAS i s rooted in the
GPRSP, i t does not meet the full requirements for a Results-Based CAS. However, an Interim-PRSP (IPRSP) was prepared in June 2003 and underpins this CAS. The CAS i s also rooted in a results-based
framework (Annex 1) linking planned Bank actions to Gabon’s medium- and long-term development
objectives via intermediate (CAS period) outcomes. The mid-term CAS review (to take place in FY07)
will, if needed, provide an opportunity to fine-tune the alignment o f the CAS with the completed GPRSP
and to establish quantitative measures o f performance.

3.

The CAS i s articulated around two pillars: (1) strengthening the management o f public resources
(both natural and financial) for improved social outcomes; and (2) improving the investment climate to
foster sustainable, private-sector-led growth.
Cross-cutting themes are developing capacity in
Government, civil society, and the private sector, and improving governance and participation.

4.

Planned lending in the Base Case would amount to US$65 million for three operations in support
of these pillars, and US$11.5 million in related GEF and IDF grants. Remaining in the Base Case would
be predicated on continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evidenced by, inter alia, a
successor arrangement with the IMF following the expiration o f the Stand-By in June 2005 and continued
satisfactory performance under such an arrangement; and continued progress in the implementation of the
forest reform agenda as evidenced notably by continued implementation of the moratorium on allocation
of new permits until the new transparent auction procedures are implemented. Departure from these
would trigger a L o w Case, under which Bank involvement would be restricted to non-lending activities
after an initial project in FY05.

5.
Consideration for moving to a High Case would be based on a modulated approach whereby in
the first instance a particularly good track record of performance of reforms in the natural resource sector
would trigger presentation of a second Natural Resources Management D P L (US$lO million) for Board
presentation in FY08. The specific triggers for this first module would include: full implementation of
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and the full and effective abolition of the export
monopoly of SNBG by January 2006. Beyond this, remaining in the High Case would be predicated on
specific actions to bring about significant improvements in the investment climate, which would trigger
preparation o f a Diversification support operation (US$18 million) for Board presentation in FY09.
Specific criteria for moving forward with this operation would be the completion o f the privatization o f
Gabon Telecom and of actions recommended by the World Bank Group’s Foreign Investment Advisory
Services (FIAS) on public procurement and real estate titles.

6.

Beyond IBRD, broader World Bank Group support i s currently limited, although such support
could develop over the CAS period. There i s scope for increased Bank/IFC collaboration if Gabon
continues to make good progress, especially if i t moves to the High Case. A US$61 million MIGA
guarantee facility for rehabilitation and modernization of a professional training institute i s expected to be
presented to the Board in M a y 2005.

11. COUNTRYCONTEXT
A. Political Economy and Social Context

7.

Gabon i s a resource-rich country with a small, highly urbanized population. Extending over
267,667 km2on the west coast of equatorial Africa, Gabon i s well-endowed with arable land, forest and
mineral resources. I t i s the fourth-largest producer o f petroleum in Africa after Nigeria, Angola and
Equatorial Guinea, and the second largest exporter o f timber after Cameroon. I t has extraordinary
biodiversity as well as rich deposits o f magnesium and iron ore. The country i s one o f the most urbanized
in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a population currently estimated at 1.3 million, with more than 50 ethnic
groups2. Approximately 75 percent o f the population i s concentrated in two major urban centers,
Libreville (pop. 450,000) and Port Gentil (pop. 100,000), and in about fifty smaller towns. The rural
population i s thinly scattered over the vast hinterland where access i s difficult.

8.
The country has been politically stable since independence and i s a force for stability in the
Central Africa Region. The country has had two political leaders, Leon Mba, the hero of independence
in 1960, and El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba, in power since 1967 and now the longest serving President
in Africa. The country shifted from single-party rule back to a multi-party political system in the early
1990s. However, the party o f the President, PDG (Parti Democratique Gabonais) maintains a dominant
position, and organized opposition i s not sufficiently significant to form a common front against the
ruling party. The party has succeeded in maintaining political stability and social peace b y ensuring that
rents and rewards are distributed among traditional authorities across ethnic lines. Parliamentary
elections last took place in 2001, and the next Presidential election i s scheduled for December 2005.
Gabon has also played a strategic role in promoting peace and stability in the central Africa region. The
President i s a respected senior statesman who i s often called upon to mediate in conflicts (recent examples
include the Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, and Togo). The importance o f such stability in
a region plagued b y conflict helps to explain the continued support of some development partners, in spite
of the country's uneven track record in transparency and public resource management.
9.

Gabon plays a leading economic role in Central Africa. Gabon's membership in C E M A C
(Communaute' Economique et Mone'taire de 1'Afrique Centrale), the Central African Economic and
Monetary Union, with a common CFA currency and exchange rate regime, has strengthened economic
management b y creating a regional framework for macroeconomic surveillance and an institutional forum
for policy dialogue. Adherence to the C E M A C convergence criteria, a set of fiscal and structural targets,
has helped constrain monetary and fiscal expansion. Furthermore, Gabon's membership in the trade
regime, with a common external tariff (CET), has acted as an inducement to considerable trade
liberalization from the early 1990s, both through reduction of average tariffs and by removing
quantitative restrictions. Finally, Gabon, together with Cameroon, has been one o f the prime movers of
sub-regional integration in Central Africa, and has promoted regional initiatives to boost the economic
inter-relationships among the member states of the zone.

For the purpose of the CAS the publishedfigure of 1.3 million i s used, although results of a recent census suggest
population could be as high as 1.5 million.

Gabon i s also a key member of the Congo Basin Forest Partnership. In 2005 and 2006,
10.
Gabon w i l l chair the Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC), following the Heads of State
Summit held in Brazzaville in February 2005. Shared responsibility for forest management i s a driver of
regional integration in Central Africa. All Central African countries share the Congo Basin Forest, which
i s o f unique value to the global community. This group of countries has common interests and common
claims, including the maintenance and sustainable use of biodiversity.

B. Poverty Profile

11.
Despite high per capita income, Gabon has not been able to overcome the challenges of
equitable economic development and minimum social welfare for all. During the initial years after
independence, the Government invested heavily in capital projects and industries, assuming substantial
debt in the process. During the o i l boom years of 1973 to 1985, the Government adopted economic
policies aimed at promoting full employment through public sector initiatives such as creation o f
parastatals. The Government provided generous wages and established an elaborate social security
system which, in spite o f i t s imperfections, was considered among the best in sub-Saharan Africa. O i l
wealth brought benefits to the urban elite which were further shared through family networks,
contributing to a massive rural to urban exodus. Lack of recent data poses a challenge in understanding
the evolution in recent years of the distributional effect of o i l wealth on poverty, but the general
perception of local citizens, conveyed to the Bank during the CAS consultations, i s that living conditions
have been steadily worsening over the past decade. While the redistribution of rents has been successful
in reducing poverty in some countries with s i m i l a r per capita incomes, t h i s does not appear to be the case
for Gabon.
12.
Inequality i s high, and large sections of the population do not have effective access to public
services. Inequalities plague the current social service delivery system, priorities are often misplaced,
and access of the poor to services remains low. The Bank‘s participatory Poverty Assessment, completed
in 1997, served to raise awareness o f these problems within Government. I t showed that despite Gabon’s
high per capita income, relative poverty in consumption terms i s widespread (at about 60 p e r ~ e n t ) ~Many
.
of Gabon’s social indicators are lagging behind other IBRD countries with similar GDP per capita (see
Table 1). While Gabon has been able to improve access to primary education and access to improved
water sources other social indicators such as immunization of one year olds, the maternal mortality ratio
and HIV/AIDS prevalence (where estimates have doubled in the past two years) are of particular concern.
In the longer run, significant progress on equity as well as growth w i l l be essential for effective and
sustained poverty reduction.

3

Relativepoverty in Gabon (defined as per capita incomes of less than the minimum wage, equivalent to about U S
$1,440 in 1993 dollars) i s very different from the extreme poverty experienced in most of Sub-SaharanAfrica. Still, the Poverty
Assessment showed that per capita incomes below half this level (less than US $700) were insufficient to meet minimum
nutritional needs and other basic spending requirements in urban areas of Gabon.

13.
I n 2000, the authorities began preparing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, although as
an IBRD borrower Gabon was not required to do so. An I-PRSP was completed in June 2003.
Subsequent work has focused on expanding public participation in the process, developing a statistical
database to better estimate current levels of poverty, and working out sectoral strategies to focus
government activities on poverty reduction. While there i s room for much improvement in public service
delivery and the management o f public resources, the ultimate solution to the poverty problem in Gabon
i s seen in economic diversification and creation o f productive economic opportunities in the private sector
for the poor. The GPRSP preparation process i s s t i l l ongoing, with a final product expected around end2005.

14.
Despite the fact that the GPRSP work i s still on-going, it was important not to delay a new
CAS at this time. There i s a need to set Bank interventions in the context o f a strategic framework

discussed with and understood by our clients and partners. Good progress has been made recently in
improving our dialogue with Gabon and in the country’s own performance. The new CAS i s needed to
demonstrate Bank commitment and to maintain the momentum o f this dialogue, as well as to pave the
way for new financial commitment and analytical and advisory work b y the Bank in the country.

15.
The timing i s favorable in order to capitalize on current high-level commitment to the
reform process, as well as to respond to growing pressures from Parliament and civil society for
reform. Major progress has been achieved in macroeconomic management, and the Government i s fully
engaged with c i v i l society and the donor community in finalizing the GPRSP. The next frontier i s for the
momentum for reform to penetrate the sector ministries and be reflected in better institutional
-4-

performance. The activities included in the Bank support program, together with the contributions o f
other development partners, w i l l help strengthen Government commitment and capacity at a critical
moment for Gabon.

16.
I t should be recognized, however, that this CAS i s only an intermediate step toward
supporting poverty reduction in Gabon. Improving management o f public resources by strengthening
revenue mobilization and public expenditure management i s a necessary prerequisite for the Government
to provide more efficient and effective services to the poor. Similarly, improvements in infrastructure and
natural resources management w i l l enhance the country’s growth potential but w i l l not necessarily bring
benefits directly to the poor. More targeted assistance w i l l need to be articulated b y the entire donor
community around the sector strategies which are expected to be included in the GPRSP, in order to
ensure that benefits from externally-funded programs actually flow to the poor in the future.
C. Macroeconomic Track Record

17.
While Gabon’s past history of program implementation has been poor, important policy
actions undertaken since mid-2002 and the broadly satisfactory track record of budgetary
implementation in 2003 and 2004 have demonstrated the renewed commitment on the part of the
authorities to implement sustained adjustment. In M a y 2004, the Executive Board o f the IMF
approved a 14-month, US$102 million Standby Arrangement supporting the Government’s economic
program. The main thrust o f the program i s to promote economic diversification through sustained fiscal
adjustment and comprehensive structural reforms. The first, second and third reviews were satisfactorily
concluded in August and December 2004, and March 2005 respectively. The current Standby
Arrangement expires in June 2005, and it i s expected that i t w i l l be followed by further IMF support, the
exact nature of which i s s t i l l under discussion. Gabon i s keen to remain under an IMF arrangement
following the expiration o f the Stand-By Arrangement. The IMF w i l l consider the most appropriate
arrangement, provided that performance under the Stand-By Arrangement remains satisfactory, and based
on the extent to which the foundations for a medium-term program are deemed to be in place. The IMF
w i l l also carry out a fiscal Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) as part o f the process
of determining what form o f support would be most appropriate for Gabon in the future.
18.
Growth has recovered somewhat
but remains modest. While the overall
macroeconomic environment has remained
stable since 2000, the economy has been
vulnerable to fluctuations in o i l prices as
well as to a declining trend in o i l production
(see Figure 1). Real GDP growth recovered
from -1.9 percent in 2000 to 2.0 percent in
2001, followed b y a decline to 0 percent in
2002, rebounding to 2.6 percent in 2003
and then dropping back to 1.4 percent in
2004 (see Table 2).

Fiscal policy has generally been consistent with macroeconomic objectives. The Government
continued i t s consolidation of public finances in 2003 and 2004, with the budget posting a surplus of 7.4
percent of GDP in 2003 and 7.8 percent in 2004. Gabon has been successful in curtailing the growth of
current expenditure by reducing the ratio from 19.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to 16.4 percent in 2004 and
the wage bill from 6.4 percent to 5.9 percent of GDP over the same period. Moreover, the Government o f
Gabon, in consultation with international development partners, w i l l assess the public expenditure
framework for social services and poverty reduction in the preparation of the GPRSP. However, l o w
execution rates o f the investment budget and gaps between allocated and the executed budgets continue to
hamper public financial management and affect the delivery o f public services. Due to tighter fiscal
measures, a reduction in tax and customs exemptions, and collection of tax arrears, an increase in the
mobilization of non-oil revenue from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to 13.4 percent in 2004 has partially
compensated for the recent and projected decline in o i l revenue. The target under the IMF-supported
program of reducing the non-oil primary deficit from 8.2 percent of non-oil GDP in 2003 to 7.7 percent in
2004 and 5.7 percent in 2005 i s broadly on track.

The external current account, including grants, has posted a surplus since the last CAS and
has risen to close to 10.4 percent of GDP in 2004 due to higher oil prices and a rise in manganese
exports (see Table 3). In 2004, total exports increased b y close to 21.5 percent with non-oil exports
increasing b y more than 12 percent, while imports increased by 19.3 percent. However, the capital
account has remained in deficit due to capital outflows and repatriation of o i l profits by foreign
companies, resulting in a slight overall balance o f payments deficit. The financing gaps in 2005-2006 are
expected to be covered b y Paris Club debt rescheduling, use o f Fund resources, and drawdown o f foreign
reserves.
21.
Like other countries in the CFA Zone, Gabon’s inflation rate has remained relatively low
over the last several years. Due to prudent monetary policy at the regional Central Bank (BEAC),
inflation was contained through the period and averaged below 2 percent. Furthermore, the fixed
exchange peg to the Euro ensures that monetary policy i s being used to stabilize the exchange rate and not
for domestic credit expansion. Also, the strict implementation of fiscal rules that set l i m i t s on B E A C
financing to monetize deficits has helped curtail inflation in Gabon. The country has successfully adhered
to the regional convergence criteria relating to fiscal balances, consumer price inflation, and external debt,
but has slipped on the criteria o f net changes in government arrears. The appreciation o f the Euro,
especially vis a vis the dollar, has led to a slight appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and a
weakening of overall export competitiveness.

22.

The Government has made considerable progress on the structural reform agenda, but
some challenges remain. Even though the former General Directorate of Price Controls has been
replaced b y a new General Directorate of Competition, Government commitment to price liberalization
has sometimes been questionable, in particular regarding the automatic adjustment of domestic retail
prices for petroleum products, which have not changed since 2002. With regard to foreign trade,
quantitative restrictions s t i l l exist, especially in the sugar sector. Some public enterprises, such as the
palm o i l company AgroGabon and the rubber company Hevegab, have been successfully privatized.
However, progress has been slow in privatizing other companies such as Gabon Telecom and Air Gabon.

23.
While the financial sector in Gabon is, in general, profitable and stable, certain structural
features could contribute to medium-term-solvency and growth concerns. Banks dominate the
financial sector, and are generally cost-efficient and liquid. Short-term banking sector risks are tempered
by a high level o f liquidity and adequate access to central refinancing. However, the activities and
potential of commercial banks are limited by the relatively small size of the non-oil economy at present,
particularly given the financing of the o i l sector i s largely undertaken outside of the country. In addition,
the banking sector i s highly concentrated, with a loan portfolio that i s non-diversified6. At end-February
2001, three out of five operating banks did not meet prudential ratios on risk diversification, leaving the
sector as a whole exposed to a small number o f enterprises. The Banks April 2003 Gabon Financial
Sector Assessment (FSA) recommended that banks: (a) diversify domestically b y entering into
underserved markets; (b) proceed with cross-border diversification; and (c) syndicate with foreign banks.
All of these trends need to be closely followed by supervisory authorities.
24.
As a CEMAC country, Gabon follows the BEAC regulations which treat money laundering
and terrorist financing as criminal offences. On November 20, 2002, the B E A C Board o f Directors
approved draft anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations that would apply to
banks, exchange houses, stock brokerages, casinos, insurance companies, and intermediaries such as
lawyers and accountants in all six member countries. The B E A C regulations would also require banks to
record and report the identity o f customers engaging in large transactions. Gabon has signed, but not yet

ratified, both the 1988 UN Drug Convention and the UN International Convention for the Suppression o f
the Financing o f Terrorism. The Gabonese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports that the National
Assembly w i l l pass the latter convention in 2005. Gabon i s expected to comply with the regional
international standards and take concrete steps to regulate and operationalize these measures so as to
establish a viable anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime.

25.
Transparency in oil revenue management has begun to be addressed. To help address this
issue, in 1998 the Government passed a law to set up a Fund for Future Generations (FFG). Under the
law, the FFG should receive 10 percent of projected o i l revenues, 50 percent o f “windfall” revenues (in
excess of projections), and accumulated interest, up to a minimum capital o f CFAF 500 billion. The
Government has been making regular deposits to the FFG account in BEAC since 2002, in agreement
with the IMF. Since January 2005, the deposits have been credited with interest at 1.7 percent. The FFG
held a balance o f CFAF’ 60 billion as o f February 2005. Together with the recent declaration o f intent to
adhere to the EITI and the first steps towards implementation with the technical support o f the Bank, the
recent history o f FFG management suggests a move in the direction of greater transparency in the
management o f o i l revenues.

A. K e y Economic Challenges

Figure 2. Importance of Oil Sector in Economy (percent)

26.

Prospects for oil, traditionally Gabon’s key
economic sector and the principal driving force of
economic growth, are declining. Since 1998, Gabon has
been facing the prospect o f a gradual decline in o i l output
because i t s current o i l fields are aging. Despite government
and foreign investment in new exploration, so far no new
large o i l fields have been discovered. Recently, the o i l
production curve has been relatively flat at around 13.5
million metric tons a year. Production i s expected to decline
over the next two years, to 11 million tons a year, as
compared to the peak o f 17 million tons in 1998. N o other
single resource in Gabon could be sustainably exploited at a
rate that could replace the projected petroleum revenue
shortfalls. The challenge facing Gabon i s to ensure continued
growth and i mproved social indicators in the face o f
declining petroleum production.

respectively. The Government w i l l need to implement sound strategies to create new sources o f growth

environment for private sector activity and selective public investment.

B. Medium-Term Macro-Economic Framework

28.
Despite these challenges, prospects for the medium term indicate stable, though very
modest, growth. High petroleum prices over the past year have allowed the coming on stream of
additional fields that would have otherwise been considered non-commercial, thus helping to stabilize o i l
production for a few years. Investment in rubber production, ongoing expansion in the agri-business
sector, as well investment in the forest and mining sectors should boost the non-oil GDP growth rate from
about 2.3 percent in 2004 to 3.5 percent on average over the period 2005 to 2008. The expected gains in
the non-oil sectors should somewhat offset the declining o i l production (oil production i s expected to
decline b y about 4.8 percent annually on average between 2004 and 2008), to achieve an average GDP
growth rate of about 1 percent in the period 2004 to 2008. The projected elevated prices for o i l and
manganese would also help the external position. The external current account surplus at 10.4 percent o f
GDP in 2004 i s forecast to increase to about 12.2 percent in 2006 (see Table 3 and 5 respectively).

Sustained growth depends on the commitment of the authorities to continue prudent fiscal
policy, as suggested under the Fund-supported program. Gabon must continue to demonstrate i t s
determination to confront i t s economic challenges b y pursuing policies aimed at diversifying the economy
and further improving the enabling environment for private sector investment in the medium term
C. Debt Sustainability

30.
Historically, Gabon has borrowed extensively to implement its expansionist economic
policies. This approach has left the country with expensive debt and heavy debt-service ratios. While the
debt i s manageable over the longer term, high debt-service ratios pose a problem in the short run,

constraining the possibility of redirecting fiscal resources to improve public service delivery. Most
external debt i s owed to official creditors, in particular to France. For this reason, there i s less risk o f an
unforeseen increase in the interest cost of debt, unlike other middle-income countries that raise most o f
their financing in capital markets.

-9-

3 1.
In the past two years, Gabon has strengthened its overall debt management. Due to better
liquidity management, the country’s payments to banks and commercial institutions have been regular.
With the approval o f the IMF Standby Arrangement, the Paris Club took note o f the country’s improved
macroeconomic and fiscal performance. In June 2004, i t reached an agreement with the Government o f
Gabon to reschedule part of the country’s external debt. The Paris Club consolidated around €717
million, which resulted in a reduction in debt service to Paris Club creditors from €953 million to €270
million over the life of the debt. Because Gabon i s an IBRD country, the debt rescheduling took place
under Paris Club’s classic terms, with all credits to be repaid progressively over fourteen years, including
three years o f grace. Paris Club creditors also included a goodwill clause, signaling their agreement to
consider a further restructuring which could include an element of debt reduction. At t h i s stage the Paris
Club creditors do not see a need to implement the goodwill clause in light of the improvement in the debt
situation, underpinned by high o i l prices.

The external debt stock of the country has decreased from 63.1 percent of GDP in 2001 to 50
percent in 2004 and i s projected to fall further to 42.4 percent in 2006 (Table 6). The latest debt
sustainability analysis indicates that t h i s decline i s due to three factors: (a) a less rapid decline in o i l
receipts due to higher prices and less rapidly declining production volumes; (b) moderate non-oil growth;
and (c) continued fiscal adjustment that results in no financing gaps. The baseline analysis indicates that
the external debt to GDP ratio decreases continuously, financing gaps disappear and the debt service
ratios peak within the next five years and decline thereafter. Similarly, Gabon’s total external debt to
GDP ratio i s projected to decrease to 45.7 percent in 2006 and fall to less than one-fifth o f GDP within
the next ten years. One key assumption underlying this trajectory i s the growth of non-oil GDP which i s
projected to average 3.5 percent in 2004-2010. At the same time, stress tests reveal that Gabon’s debt
sustainability continues to be sensitive to shocks in non-oil growth (which affect both non-oil exports and
budget revenues) and to changes in o i l prices, since higher projected oil prices translate into greater ease
in meeting debt service obligations.

Iv. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM AND ISSUES
A. Country Priorities and Agenda

(i) National Development Strategy Objectives

33.
The overarching goal of Gabon’s national development strategy i s to generate sustained
growth for poverty reduction. The country’s medium-term development goals, as described in the IPRSP and the long-term vision document “Gabon 2025”, are (1) to foster non-oil private-sector-led
growth; and (2) to strengthen public sector effectiveness and efficiency. The I-PRSP highlights the
Government’s commitment to ensure that the fruits of t h i s growth benefit the poor more directly, through
job creation in non-oil sectors. The Government also intends to improve the efficiency and equity o f
public expenditures, specifically to improve the quality of investments in education and health.
34.

Government’s view of the approach to reducing poverty has evolved over time. The major
objectives identified in the I-PRSP were to: (i)
reduce unemployment; (ii)
halt the rural economic decline;
(iii)
improve access to basic social services; (iv) strengthen the social safety nets; (v) ensure that the poor
have better living conditions; (vi) improve the position of women in society; and (vii) introduce more
efficient governance systems. These objectives and the means to achieve them w i l l be more fully
developed in the full PRSP. While initially the authorities conceived the PRSP as a catalog of measures
to fight poverty directly, they have now adopted the classic format of the PRSP that includes growth
policies. The document i s now referred to as the growth and poverty reduction strategy paper or
Document de strate‘gie de croissance et de rkduction de la pauvrete‘ (GPRSP), to emphasize the growthbased pro-poor vision of development that the country i s pursuing.

35.
The Bank is assisting Government to finalize the GPRSP. The Bank has provided technical
assistance particularly to improve the statistical base, develop an accurate poverty profile, and improve
the participatory process in the preparation o f the document. In t h i s context, provincial workshops with
civil society, major stakeholders, and development partners were held around the country from July 2004
and w i l l be completed during the first semester of 2005. Work on the poverty profile i s underway and
results are expected b y June 2005. At the same time, the authorities are preparing key sectoral policies
and quantifying the costs of the related investment program.

36.

Gabon has made substantial progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals
(Table 7), although significant challenges remain. Extreme poverty i s believed not to be very widespread
in Gabon (11 percent i s the current estimate, extrapolated from earlier calculations based on 1993 data).
A high proportion of school-age children (93.5 percent) are enrolled in primary school, with a gender gap
of only 2 percent in favor of males. However, the poor quality of education and high repeater and dropout rates suggest that not all the goals of primary education are being achieved. Gabon has made
significant progress in reducing child mortality, from 155 per 1000 live births in 1992 to 91.4 per 1000 in
2000. This i s impressive given that the average Sub-Saharan African child mortality rate i s 161.5 per
1000 live births and increasing. Similarly, the maternal mortality rate in Gabon, though higher than the
global average, i s one of the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country has not, however, been able to
ensure access to adequate basic health services for all. For example, immunization rates in 2002 were
lower than the Sub-Saharan Africa average, standing at 38 percent for DPT and 55 percent for measles,
versus the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 59 percent and 57 percent respectively.

1. Halve between 1990 and
2015 the proportion of
people i n extreme poverty
and who suffer from hunger

From 1990 to 1999 the
proportion of the world's
people living on less than
US$l a day fell from 29 %
to 23 %, but progress was
uneven.

From 1990 to 1999 the
proportion of people in

decreased, from 47.7 % to
46.7 %, too small to reach
the 23.9 % target by 2015.

The proportion of people i n Gabon living
an less than US$ 1 a day was estimated
at 23 % in 19939. On the assumption
that past trends have continued, extreme
poverty i n Gabon would now be only
about 11 % of the population.

With respect to environmental sustainability and access to potable water, Gabon faces new
challenges. L o w population density in Gabon’s hinterland makes i t more likely to preserve biodiversity
than in most other tropical countries. However, significant commercial poaching takes place in
connection with industrial logging. The fishing industry i s poorly monitored, and fish stocks are
uncertain. Surface water resources are relatively abundant; however, recent problems in the supply and
distribution o f potable water to urban centers and deteriorating sanitation conditions have given rise to
significant health concerns.
38.
HIV/AIDS and other diseases are of concern. The HIV prevalence rate in Gabon i s estimated
at over 8 percent in 2003, with the two major urban centers reporting even higher prevalence rates,
especially among the productive age group o f 25 to 39. The Government i s well aware of the increasing
urgency o f the problem and has begun working on a National Strategy for HIV/AIDS prevention and
control. The country received US$3.15 million from the Global Fund to address the alarming progression
o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to reduce i t s impact on the general population, and in particular on groups
in a vulnerable situation. Prevention campaigns have also been implemented with the support o f
UNAIDS. Other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis are also prevalent in Gabon, as well as
occasional outbreaks of Typhoid and Ebola.
39.
Gabon can contribute relatively little to the global effort towards the Millennium
Development Goals, both because of i t s small population and because i t has largely succeeded in
addressing the most extreme characteristics of poverty as seen in a global perspective. The poverty
challenges facing Gabon today are addressing severe economic inequalities, generating more benefits
from non-oil natural resources and ensuring their equitable distribution, ensuring sustainability o f the
resource base, finding productive employment for the poor and non-poor alike, and improving the quality
o f basic services, while enhancing the access of the poor through targeted redistribution o f resources
within existing programs and budgets. Continued progress in meeting the challenge of HIV/AIDS w i l l
also be critical.
B. Key Development Challenges

40.

Gabon faces two main challenges in order to reduce poverty, improve governance, and
foster economic growth. These challenges are: (i)
improving efficiency and equity in the use of public
diversifying the economy b y improving the investment
resources, both natural and financial; and (ii)
climate, including infrastructure, for private sector development. A cross-cutting theme i s better
governance, through improved transparency and accountability in the use of public resources and in basic
service delivery mechanisms. The planned assistance program of the World Bank Group has been set up
in order to assist the Government in addressing these challenges.

(i) Improving Efficiency and Equity in Public Resources Management

41.

Improving delivery of social services to all households i s a key medium-term challenge
facing the Gabonese authorities. The success of the Government’s effort to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) depends on the allocation of increasingly scarce resources to support
improvements in human capital and the delivery of social services. The GPRSP, to be completed in 2005,
w i l l help further discipline the Government’s policy-setting and allocation processes during the CAS
period by giving priority to areas most likely to assist in achieving the MDGs. Sectoral strategies to be
prepared under the GPRSP w i l l provide guidance for future institutional and policy reforms, which were
not accomplished as planned during the last CAS.

42.

Low budget execution, particularly with regard to the investment budget, has hampered the
effectiveness of public spending. Despite relatively significant budget resources earmarked for health
(for example, Gabon budgets about 3.6 percent of GDP on health), poor management and cash flow
problems have constrained the execution of programs aimed at combating diseases and achieving the
MDG health outcomes. This explains partly why Gabon, although a relatively wealthy country, has social
indicators similar to lower income countries (Gabon i s ranked 122 in the world according to the Human
Development Index). The vaccination rate, for example, dropped steadily in the latter half of the 1990s:
in 1996, the percentage of children immunized against DPT was estimated at 62 percent, but by 2001 i t
had decreased to 38 percent."

43.
Since 2002, Gabon has begun undertaking reforms to strengthen the impact of public
spending, under the guidance of the Fund and the Bank. Some o f these reforms have attempted to
restructure budget procedures in order to strengthen the programmatic links between the budget and the
Government's poverty reduction objectives. For instance, in 2003, the Government introduced program
budgets and initiated the development of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). The mediumterm program i s aimed at sustaining fiscal adjustment and boosting non-oil sectors' growth and poverty
reduction potential. A public expenditure review exercise, supported by several development partners,
has recently begun and i s designed to support government efforts to improve public resources
management and to provide input into the GPRSP. I t w i l l provide an overall diagnosis of public financial
management issues and address key elements of budget preparation and execution.
44.

Gabon lacks timely and reliable statistics, and needs to develop statistical capacity in order
to measure progress in achieving results. Timely and reliable statistics are key inputs to the results
management process. Lack of reliable data in Gabon affects the authorities' ability to formulate policies
based on solid analytical work and to monitor or evaluate development programs. The Bank's ability to
offer meaningful policy advice i s also constrained b y the paucity of data. The ongoing preparation o f the
GPRSP has drawn attention to the deficient statistical base. The 1993 household budget and consumption
survey provides the most recent data available for analytical work on poverty. Results of the 2003 Census
of Population and Housing are yet to be published. The sampling frame for the most recent data on social
indicators, the health and demographic survey (2002)' was based on the 1993 census (i.e. outdated census
information). In order to update statistical information on poverty, the authorities are working closely
with the Bank to undertake a new rapid household survey o f the C W I Q (Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire) type. This survey instrument w i l l allow the authorities to update the non-pecuniary
measures o f poverty while building the capacity to process data rapidly using optical scanning
technology. The results of t h i s survey, when available, will be shared with all stakeholders as part of the
Bank's support to the GPRSP process.
(ii)

Improving the Investment Environment for Private Sector Development

45.

To reduce the country's heavy dependence on oil, Gabon needs to jumpstart private-sectorled diversification. T o foster economic development and increase employment, non-oil natural resources
need to contribute more significantly to the GDP, through improved public sector management and
increased private sector investment in these sectors. The Government i s aware that measures need to be
taken to improve the investment climate and attract investment in the non-oil sectors. The Foreign
Investment Advisory Services (FIAS), a joint service o f the Bank and the IFC, recently completed a
diagnostic study of the investment climate in Gabon (see Box 1). I t identified several areas in need o f
improving governance and the rule o f law; (ii)
improving investment-related administrative
attention: (i)
reforming the tax system; (iv) improving infrastructure; and (v) reducing the costs of
procedures; (iii)
inputs.

Box 1. F I A S Diagnostic of the Investment Environment Key Recommendations
Improve Governance and the Rule of Law:
Make this a top priority of the Government’s program and announce i t at highest level.
Follow through by quickly designing a multi-faceted, multi-year strategy to improve the Rule of Law
(with components on anti-conuption, judicial reform, civil service reform, legal reform and
information, legal and judicial training, deregulation, etc.).
Integrate the currently scattered initiatives into t h i s holistic strategy.
With development partners’ assistance, start implementing the multi-year comprehensive govemance
strategy.
Facilitate Private Sector Development:
Strengthen Banque Gabonaise de Dkveloppement (BGD) by increasing i t s resources and the number
of financial instruments it can use to support private enterprise development. Consider introducing
venture capital in Gabon, through BGD or otherwise. Consider increasing BDG’s capital.
Review the role and assess the impact of PROMOGABON and APIP in order to decide whether they
should be maintained in their current form or restructured with a view to making them more effective
instruments.
Design a strategy to encourage informal operators to formalize. The strategy should aim to simplify
the administrative procedures for investment, to simplify the tax system, to provide accounting
support, and to tackle all the constraints that currently encourage entrepreneurs to remain in the
informal sector.
Reform education and professional training to reduce the gap between private sector needs and the
skills of the labor force.
As part o f the investment climate improvement program being conducted by FIAS, launch a study
focusing on S M E access to credit to diagnose the constraints limiting S M E access to commercial
finance and to recommend ways and means to improve such access (including through micro-finance
schemes). The study could be done in partnership with CGAP and/or PEP-Africa.
Agree on priority actions that need to be undertaken to alleviate the other constraints facing private
sector operators, taking into account the recommendations o f World Bank-supported studies including
the FIAS diagnostic study and the upcoming IFR.
Streamline formalities and reduce the cost o f business registration.
Ensure that all agencies concerned contribute to the functioning of the “one-stop shop” (under the
Investment Promotion Agency).
Adopt transparent procedures for business visas and clarify and standardize procedures for residency
permits.
Publish public procurement opportunities and contract awards.
Improve customs clearance procedures and remove the statistical tax for customs (RUSID).
Clarify procedures and reduce delays to secure final property title, inform the public of the revised
procedures.
Reform the tax system:
Implement the State Finance Act of 1995 prohibiting taxes not included in the budget law (parafiscalitd).
Launch a specific study on corporate taxation and investment incentives as planned under the program
agreed with FIAS. This study would constitute a useful input for the broader program of tax reform
that the Govemment i s discussing with the IMF.
Improve infrastructure and reduce costs of inputs:
Engage consultations with development pattners and the private sector on priorities (energy, telecom,
transport) and on that basis design a strategy.
Complete privatization o f Air Gabon and pursue the restructuring of the telecom market by
completing the privatization of Gabon Telecoms and strengthening the telecom regulatory agency.

-15-

46.
The inefficient functioning of the law and justice sector represents a major impediment to
private sector development in Gabon. There i s a consensus among relevant stakeholders regarding the
need to invest adequate resources in t h i s sector to promote the rule of law both as a matter of general
concern and a means to enhance business and investment climate in Gabon.

47.
Gabon’s strategy in the non-oil sectors i s different from those of its neighbors. Unlike most
Sub-Saharan African countries, Gabon does not depend very much on agricultural exports. Rather, i t s
strategy i s to become a base for international services, especially those needed by the petroleum industry,
while developing natural-resource-related transformation industries and tourism. If t h i s strategy i s
successful, Gabon could become an important economic partner for i t s neighbors as well as for the
international community. I t s collaboration within the Congo Basin Initiative on the Tri-National Park i s
one example of such partnership in the area of tourism, which involves joint efforts by the three park
agencies concerned. such as coherent land use planning across borders, harmonization o f procedures and
regulations, joint awareness raising and consultations processes. joint surveillance and other law
enforcement activities, and setting up joint planning and monitoring and evaluation systems.
48.

Forestry, currently the second-largest sector in terms of job creation after the public sector,
has significantly greater potential to contribute to economic development. Gabon has 22.5 hectares
of forest per capita, one of the highest ratios in the world. However, the sector’s contribution to the
national economy remains below i t s potential in terms of employment. revenues and community
development. The timber industry today provides about 7,000 direct jobs, whereas i t could probably
provide twice as much employment in related transformation and transport services, without increasing
the level of harvesting. The challenge for Gabon i s to increase forest-based benefits for the population
while maintaining timber harvesting at a sustainable level, in accordance with forest management plans.
Greater transparency and law enforcement i s needed at all steps of the sequence to foster accountability
and reduce the room for corruption and arbitrary decisions. This requires removing policy and
governance bottlenecks that have hampered sector performance during the last four decades.

49.

Striking progress in forest sector reform marks a significant break from the past. Over the
recent past, the Government has taken bold and concrete steps to improve transparency and efficiency in
passing a new Forest Code in
the forestry sector. Highlights of the recent reforms include notably: (i)
2001; (ii)
creating 13 national parks which total ten percent o f Gabon’s total surface areal2 in 2002; (iii)
simplifying the fiscal regime
under the 2004 finance law;
(iv) approving a letter of
sector policy in M a y 2004
Fiscal regime simplified in 2004 finance law
spelling out the priority
Letter of Sector Policy adopted by Council of Ministers
reform agenda with a focus
on transparency and basic
law
enforcement;
(v)
enacting a decree establishing
a moratorium on the discretionary allocation o f logging rights in August 2004; (vi) enacting a decision to
abolish the long-standing monopoly on export marketing b y the public marketing agency (SNBG) b y
January 2006; and (vii) disclosing the l i s t o f logging and non-compliant permits in the local newspaper
and on the internet in 2005. The recent achievements mark a significant break from the past performance
of the sector which was characterized by a lack of transparency, interference b y vested interests, and
distortions in the incentive framework. These are important first steps that need to be followed with
further reforms in the same direction.
12
The creation of thirteen national parks by President Bongo Ondimba in 2002 was explicitly presented as a move
towards diversification of the economy, intended to stimulate eco-tourism and private sector activities.

-16-

50.
The recent reforms create a unique window of opportunity to deepen forest sector reforms
and ensure their sustainability. The reform agenda in the forest sector, as described in the M a y 2004
letter of development policy, i s far reaching and includes provision for development of participatory
forest zoning, monitoring of sustainable management plans and of illegal logging, development of
community forestry, retrocession o f a share of revenues to local entities, and the development of nonextractive uses o f forests. Through fiscal incentives the Government i s also encouraging the expansion of
domestic processing in terms of both quantity and quality.13 Removal of the SNBG export monopoly will
remove market distortions and increase the sector’s competitiveness. The planned Bank support for the
forest reform agenda (see Box 2) w i l l be crucial to ensure the momentum i s not lost.
Box 2. Past and Planned Bank Involvementin Forest and Environmentin Gabon

The Bank’s Forest and Environment Project (PFE) laid the early groundwork for improved management
of Gabon’s forest and environmental resources. Approved in 1992, the project closed in 2002. In the interval
since the PFE closed in 2002, policy dialogue has developed and gathered momentum through the preparationby
the Government of a National Forest and Environment Sector Program (PSFE) in coordination with all interested
donors, private sector and civil society.
Gabon has significantly expanded i t s protected areas network, which now covers more than 10 percent
of the nation’s surface area, including marine ecosystems, and i s setting up an autonomous agency for national
park management. In 2004, Gabon’s Council of Ministers adopted a Letter of Sector Policy on natural resources
management, including forests, fisheries, biodiversity protection and environmental management. This policy
aims at promoting employment, revenues, rural development and increased entrepreneurship while protecting
natural ecosystems and biodiversity. Later in 2004, the Government confirmed i t s commitment to greater
transparency in managing the forest sector by establishing a moratorium on sole-source attribution of logging
permits. In December 2004, the Government decided to remove the monopoly of the National Timber
Marketing Company (SNBG), starting January 2006, so as to liberalize the timber trade. These reforms
represent a striking departure from the long-standing climate of opacity, discretion and distorted incentives.
These are f i s t steps which should be followed by further reforms in the same direction.
Through the two planned Natural Resources DevelopmentPolicy Loans and a planned Grant from the
Global Environment Facility, the Bank intends to support the implementation of Gabon’s PSFE program in
synergy with other development partners (France, EU, US, AfDB among others). Bank and other donor support
will help capitalize on the very significant recent Government reforms to ensure that they take hold and are
deepened. The PSFE program will also provide unique opportunities to involve the Bank and other partners in
the reform process that i s also starting to emerge in the fisheries and mining sectors. By linking lending to the
implementation of reforms, the planned operations will strengthen the voice of reformers and increase their
capacity to overcome resistance from vested interests. The two-staged DPL approach will also mitigate against
the loss of momentum in the reform process.

51.
Gabon has important geological reserves and a long history of mining, especially of
manganese and uranium. However, compared to other countries with s i m i l a r mineral endowments, the
contribution of the mining sector to the country’s wealth has remained relatively small. Besides
manganese, of which Gabon i s the world’s third largest producer, mining activities are restricted to
artisanal production of gold and diamonds and, to a lesser extent, excavation o f construction material.
Gabon i s considered to have good mining potential and several mineral deposits have been identified over
the years such as: gold (with a number of high grade small deposits identified in 11 regions in Gabon),
iron ore, and columbium, along with several other minerals. The mining potential of the country i s not
reflected in i t s current mining output. Potential mining output i s estimated to be capable of generating
about US$300 to US$400 million annually in revenues in the long term if a favorable investment
13

Domestic processing capacity increased from about 10 percent in 1990 to about 30 percent in 2002.

-17-

environment exists and the appropriate regulatory systems are put in place. A recent diagnostic review of
the mining sector, conducted by the Bank, has identified key reforms needed and has also highlighted the
importance o f addressing artisanal mining activities (diamonds) and improving environmental
management of mining activities.

52.

Fisheries also represent a potential growth sector. At over 40 kg per capita Gabon’s fish
consumption i s among the highest in Africa. Recorded fish production in 2004 was 45,000 metric tons o f
which over 70 percent i s produced by artisanal fishers. In terms of biological potential the annual yield o f
the fisheries has been estimated at 230,000 tons, but reliable estimates of the sustainable level o f
production have not been made and despite a recent promising survey o f deeper waters, the resource base
i s poorly known. Non-Gabonese nationals constitute 80 percent of the sector’s labor force which
complicates stakeholder engagement. Weak sector governance, ineffective monitoring and control and
lack o f transparency in licensing contribute to the absence of a clear vision for the future o f the sector.
Gabon sees the development of t h i s sector as an alternative source of food for the local population and a
potential revenue earner. On-shore fishing b y communities and families can probably improve food
security and increase cash income for poor communities and households. With regard to industrial offshore fishing, the margin of improvement probably resides more in providing Government with
sustainable revenues that can then be allocated to improved social service provision through public
expenditures.

53.

The current transport situation hinders the development of productive sectors, particularly
in the rural hinterland. Gabon has 9,170 kilometers of roads, of which only 10 percent are paved. The
two planned main axes connecting north to south and east to west are not completed. Part of the east-west
axis i s connected b y an old and dilapidated railway system. Development o f a new roads system i s
difficult to justify economically given the very l o w population density and l o w economic activity in the
rural areas and on the other side o f the borders. The solution more favored by developing partners most
active in the transport sector, including EU, the AfDB and AFD, i s to rehabilitate existing priority
networks and to ensure that adequate public financing i s available for their maintenance. The railroad
concession, which was suspended following a dispute with the operator and i s currently functioning under

temporary arrangements, w i l l have to be renewed under more financially viable terms and conditions.
The National Airline needs to be quickly restructured and re-capitalized b y the private sector.

54.
Tourism has a high potential in this country that i s part of one of the largest rainforest
ecosystems in the world. However, tourism has not yet attracted significant investment. Gabon i s
endowed with a 10,000 km coastline, wetlands, rivers, and rich faunal and floral wildlife. I t s forests

belong to the Congo Basin tropical rainforest ecosystem, the world’s second largest area o f contiguous
rainforest. Although the Government has recently taken bold conservationist measures and introduced
new tax incentives to promote high-value, low-volume tourism, growth has been slow. Airfares to
Europe and the U S remain expensive, tourism-related infrastructure and services are inadequate and
costly, and both Government and private sector have failed to embark on a serious sector growth strategy.
Foreign investors can only be expected when the sector-specific business environment reaches a critical
threshold.

-18-

55.
Despite the major role of cities in Gabon’s economic growth, urban infrastructure has been
globally under-funded (less than 10 percent o f public investments) in the last t w o decades. Poor works
supervision by the administration and failure to pay the contractors on time has had consequences in
terms of cost overruns and poor quality of works. Most public works are capital intensive, with very little
impact o n employment in the construction sector. Financial resources that could enable cities to better
manage urban infrastructure have not been transferred to municipalities. With the exception of Libreville
and Port Gentil, most towns in Gabon have little capacity to handle infrastructure development and
maintenance.
Box 3. Pilot Community Infrastructure .Works and Capacity Building Project
The Pilot Community Infrastructure Works and Capacity Building Project (Learning and
Innovation Loan) provided a practical test of approaches adopted in the Urban Sector Strategy developed under
the earlier Transport Sector technical Assistance project (approved in FY95 and closed in €9’00). It was
designed to test new methods for building community-based infrastructure and providing support for local
contractors. The goal was to improve living conditions in selected poor urban neighborhoods in a sustainable
way and with substantial community participation. The project also aimed at building local capacity to
undertake a larger program of community based-public works.
Despite i t s s m a l l size, the project was perceived by i t s stakeholders as the most concrete and practical
way to address the poverty issue in Gabon. This project has allowed for the definition o f appropriate approaches
and modus operandi for “soft” and community-based upgrading of low-income settlements as opposed to heavy
restructuring. Rather than starting with heavy land restructuring and regularization and major infrastructure
change that would have dramatically raised land values and upset the social composition o f the targeted
settlements, the infrastructure upgrading effort focused on adapted improvements to existing main access and
transit roads. The objective was to facilitate physical access to services (such as transportation, fire crews,
ambulances) and improve sanitation and drainage in the targeted areas. In additiqn, and with technical support
provided by PAPSUT through the municipalities, the recipient communities put together community-based
micro-projects centered around the already improved access and transit road through their neighborhoods. As a
result, micro-projects (essentially water, sanitation, and drainage facilities and pedestrian paths to the main
transit roads) were identified in the targeted neighborhoods and implemented with the effective contribution o f
municipalities and communities.

All works included in the project were carried out by local entrepreneurs selected after open
competitive bidding and without noticeable cost overruns. These works apparently have been the only ones
included in the national PIP actually procured through open and competitive bidding. The technology used for
access and transit road pavement (cement blocks) turned out to be the most appropriate to facilitate involvement
o f local SMEs in the infrastructure upgrading process.
For the first time in Gabon, municipalities were involved in road paving projects. They learned how to
procure these works and participated with community leaders in the design and implementation of microprojects. As the methodology was developed, manuals were prepared, and training was performed on the project
sites. This early experience was then used to train local government s t a f f on the job, creating technical units in
the municipalities and involving them in project implementation. The project also trained professionals to help
communities select the works to be performed, mobilize community contributions, and explain work procedures.
A methodology for community participation was developed, tested, and improved. This process, although timeconsuming, now provides the basis for larger future initiatives. A similar learning-by-doing process was used to
extract lessons from the early involvement o f SMEs and design and provide training for young entrepreneurs in
procurement and other management skills.

A few months before i t s closure on June 30, 2004, the project was discussed and evaluated openly at a
national workshop that included representatives from all relevant line ministries, local governments, the local
private sector, and civil society. The participants in the workshop praised the project’s achievements and
requested that the initiative be expanded, in terms of both sector coverage (social infrastructure in health and
education, transport and municipal facilities) and geographical coverage (urban and rural areas).

-19-

56.
Rapid urban growth challenges Gabon’s capacity to provide acceptable living conditions.
Access to housing i s a big problem in Gabon, particularly in the main urban centers such as Libreville and
Port Gentil. And while more than 30 percent of Gabonese households have access to electricity, and 71
percent have access to clean water, the infrastructure in place i s aging and there i s an urgent need to
rehabilitate the existing facilities and expand them to serve peri-urban areas. There i s insufficient public
funding or private interest to finance these works on a large scale. Through a Learning and Innovation
Loan (LIL), the Bank has been supporting the development of community-based small-scale
infrastructure and the growth of small construction contractors. The success of t h i s pilot project has led to
the preparation o f a new project that w i l l be developed on a larger scale during the coming CAS period
and to extend i t s scope to the reconstruction of small-scale public buildings such as schools and clinics
(see Box 3).
(iii) Governance and Participation

57.
Efficient and transparent management of public finances has been an ongoing challenge to
the Government and the donor community. Annual budgets are formulated and approved, but off-line
expenditures arranged through unorthodox procedures often preclude effective execution o f the budget.
These problems are well recognized b y civil servants who are constrained in their ability to run their
programs, but are powerless to control the budgetary process. The circulation of information i s highly
restricted both within and outside the Government. As a result, there i s little confidence within the
private sector, and high costs are attached to any government transaction. Under the Bank-supported
Privatization Project approved in 1997 and closed in June 2004, the Government began to gain experience
with more transparent procedures and to understand better why poor governance could constitute an
obstacle to private investment.
58.
M o r e timely dissemination of statistics will help strengthen governance. In order to improve
fiscal transparency, the Gabonese authorities have made a significant effort to ensure the proper flow o f
fiscal information to the public b y making available (through the Finance Ministry’s statistical unit) a
comprehensive database on fiscal activity. More timely publication o f such information i s necessary,
particularly with regard to the proper monitoring of the Fund Standby Arrangement.
59.
Gabon has made significant progress toward liberalization of the economy, but challenges
remain. Although the agenda i s not yet complete, there has recently been visibly increasing commitment
to improve the business climate and implement a reform agenda in key sectors such as forestry and
mining. However, several issues remain to be tackled. For example, efficient and transparent pricing
mechanisms for natural resources and related tax collection now need to be implemented, in order to
allow for an adequate sharing o f the rent. In the past, forest revenues have been poorly collected and noncompliant companies not sanctioned, which discourages responsible investors. On-going reforms in the
forest sector, which focus on transparency in concession allocation and on law enforcement, w i l l establish
a more level playing field for responsible investors.
60.
The combination of declining revenues and the need to attract more private investment
provides a powerful incentive for Government to improve transparency and efficiency in the use of
public resources, both natural and financial. In spite o f continued resistance from vested interests,
there i s growing recognition among public authorities that resources need to be directed more efficiently
to improve basic service delivery, and that new resources could be developed through economic
diversification. At the express request of the President, the Government has declared i t s intention to
implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and has asked for Bank support in t h i s
area (see Box 4). This commitment to improving the transparency o f revenues derived from extractive
industries provides a clear indication of support for the agenda of improved transparency and governance.
I t i s also a signal of Government’s growing commitment to increase transparency in the management of
-20-

public resources. Reforms agreed under the forest reform agenda set forth in the Letter o f Natural
Resource Policy under President Bongo Ondimba’s leadership are also contributing to this objective.

Box 4. Gabon and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
The EITI aims at increasing transparency with respect to payments made to the Government by oil, gas
and mining companies. A t the E I T I second annual conference held in London on March 17,2005, participants
in the Initiative endorsed the following criteria for implementation:
0
Regular publication of all material oil, gas and mining payments by companies to governments
(“payments”) and all material revenues received by governments from oil, gas, and mining companies
(“revenues”) to a wide audience in a publicly accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible manner;
0
Where such audits do not already exist, payments and revenues are the subject o f a credible, independent
audit, applying international auditing standards;
0
Payments and revenues are reconciled by a credible, independent administrator, applying international
auditing standards and with publication o f the administrator’s opinion regarding reconciliation including
discrepancies, should any be identified;
0
This approach i s extended to all companies including state-owned enterprises;
0
Civil society i s actively engaged as a participant in the design, monitoring and evaluation of this process
and contributes towards public debate;
0
A public, financially sustainable work plan for all the above i s developed by the host government, with
assistance from the international financial institutions where required, including measurable targets, a
timetable for implementation, and an assessment of potential capacity constraints.
Implementing countries are encouraged to exceed these criteria where possible, in l i n e with the
principles of the IMF Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency and the good practice examples in the
accompanying Manual on Fiscal Transparency.

A preliminary needs assessment and a diagnostic of revenue flows and institutional responsibility for
assessment and collection of extractive industry revenues have been carried out by the Bank with respect to the
hydrocarbon and mining sectors. Further to t h i s initial assessment, a road map for implementation of the EITI
has been prepared. An inter-ministerial committee entrusted with the coordination of the EITI implementation,
the EITI Work Group, was created by ministerial decree February 24, 2005. The EITI Work Group i s currently
defining a detailed action plan and responsibility for implementation.
Civil Society plays an important role in ensuring that high standards in transparency and accountability
in public life, government operations and business are applied. To this end, the creation of a Stakeholders’
Group composed of civil society representative, industry representatives and government i s envisaged to
facilitate public debate over measures to enhance transparency in the extractive industry. This w i l l ensure that
all necessary reforms are introduced after due consultation, which w i l l facilitate their understanding and
acceptance. Participation in the Stakeholders’ Group i s voluntary and non-binding.
While the involvement of the industry representatives does not present too many difficulties, the
establishment of the civil society component of the stakeholders group poses some challenges. There are few
non-governmental organizations in Gabon, familiar with the complexities of the hydrocarbon sector. The
Government i s envisaging actions to improve civil society understanding of the Extractive Industry and to
strengthen their ability to actively participate in i t s implementation. As an interim measure, the Government’s
advisory body, Conseil Economique et Social (a consultative body comprised of government, private sector and
civil society representatives) i s being considered to represent civil society in the stakeholder group.

61.
Gabon’s Parliament i s not yet a strong force for improving governance. The Parliament
comprises t w o chambers: the National Assembly (120 members, elected by direct popular vote) and the
Senate, (9 1 members, elected by municipal councils and departmental assemblies). The Constitution
gives the Parliament the power to “vote laws, set public taxation and oversee the action o f the executive
power.” The PDG members find i t difficult to monitor and influence government policy and programs.
There i s a strong need felt for capacity development to enable Parliament to play i t s proper role in
ensuring better governance for the people o f Gabon (see Annex 2).
-21-

62.
Civil society does not yet play an effective role in shaping, implementing and overseeing
national policies in Gabon (see Box 5). Before 1990, a small number o f Civil Society Organizations
(CSOs) existed in Gabon. However, i t was only with the establishment o f the multi-party political system
in the country that the c i v i l society movement truly emerged in Gabon. Since then, there has been a
proliferation o f associations, NGOs, and labor unions. According to different accounts, between 800 and
1000 such organizations exist in the country today. However, the State i s s t i l l reluctant to accept c i v i l
society as a real partner of development. I t i s seen more as a counter-power, hindering the Government’s
work, and a source of instability and social disturbance. Some structures o f dialogue have been put in
place by individual ministries over the past few years, but they receive few funds. A legal framework t o
regulate c i v i l society-government partnership has been in the works for four years, but there i s s t i l l n o
institutionalized forum for interaction w i t h the Government. In addition, legal recognition o f associations
by the Ministry o f the Interior takes a long time.
Box 5. Capacity Development for Civil Society
Challenges: Many challenges hinder the effectiveness of Gabonese civil society as a development partner:
Most Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Gabon lack funding and equipment, have no permanent staff or
headquarters, and receive little donor assistance.
Many organizations lack skills in project conception and implementation. They also often need to improve the
transparency of their management.
There i s a lack of associative culture in the country. People do not readily mobilize behind an associative
structure, and membership fees are difficult to collect. Often, only the President and a small nucleus of people
run the organization.
The civil society movement i s strongly politicized. Very often, organizations are created by Government
officials or other parties with political interests. This creates suspicion within civil society itself as well as on
the part of the Govemment and development partners.
Consequently, there i s a lack of dialogue and collaboration between the different structures o f civil society.
Coordinating structures are not representative and often overlap one another.
The Conseil Economique et Social, a council composed of high-level representatives from different sectors of
society in charge o f advising the Government, has not been fully effective in promoting civil society
participation.
Many of these non-state actors lack a long-term vision of their role in Gabon’s development. Often their
activities lack cohesion with their set objectives. Many organizations change their programs according to
circumstances (new elections, availability of funds, intemational forum dealing with a specific issue). Such
opportunism once more undermines their credibility.
There i s reticence on part of the State to accept civil society as a real partner of development.
Bank Response: Consultations for the 2005-2008 CAS stressed the importance of Bank involvement in civil
society capacity development. The Bank plans to pursue this objective through the following avenues, with the help
o f Country Office resources and an IDF grant and/or a W B I training program.
Systematically involve civil society in the design, implementation, and evaluation o f Bank-led programs.
Undertake an extensive outreach campaign (through bulletins, conferences, the Public Information Center) so as
to present Bank procedures and activities and gather information on civil society organizations throughout the
country (their objectives, interests and capacities).
Encourage the Govemment to involve civil society actors in the conception, execution and monitoring of public
programs and to establish a regulatory framework to guide government interaction with civil society. The
GPRSP preparation and implementation process provides an important venue for collaboration between civil
society and the Government.
Provide or fiance training programs in project conception and execution, financial management, activity
reporting, leadership, communication and cross-cutting issues.
Promote civil society collaboration through setting up fora, activities and networks where different
organizations can meet and discuss strategies to enhance their credibility and influence in shaping public
policies. Establish a dialogue with, and support, existing coordinating structures within civil society (NGO
networks and platforms) as well as within the Government and involve the Conseil Economique et Social.
Support and Coordinate actions for civil society capacity-building undertaken b y other development partners.

V. WORLDBANKGROUPASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Lessons Learned
(i) Implementation of the Lust CAS

63.

The 1998 CAS embraced an ambitious agenda for political and social reform, including
significant attention to poverty alleviation. A Completion Report for the 1998 CAS (CASCR) was
prepared in June 2004 (Annex 4). CAS performance i s rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The 1998
country assistance program was relevant to broad national goals, but was not well aligned with
government views about how to achieve those goals. The country did not make acceptable progress
towards a majority of the CAS outcomes, although i t did make progress on privatization and some
progress on macroeconomic management and capacity development. The CAS expectations were
probably unrealistic under the best of circumstances, particularly in the area of poverty alleviation.
Furthermore, the resources available to the country team were too limited to provide all the non-lending
support foreseen in the CAS.
Box 6. Lessons L e a r n e d from the CASCR

Three key observations can be drawn from the CASCR:
Gabon’s future depends on i t s capacity to better use i t s natural resource endowment
1.
Bank needs to remain present, maintain candid dialogue, and ensure wide dissemination and
2.
ownership of initiatives
There i s a need to invest i n capacity development within the civil society
3.

-23-

64.

The lessons of the CASCR have been internalized by the country team and Bank
management (see Box 6). Since 1999, the Bank has maintained a Country Office in Gabon, and the
dialogue with Government and c i v i l society has improved significantly in recent years. Consultations on
the C A S C R and the present CAS started early, in parallel with ongoing GPRSP consultations. The
present C A S aims to be more realistic and less ambitious, focusing on capacity development in
Government, the private sector, and c i v i l society, while paying greater attention to the role o f
development partners and the need to focus B a n k interventions on areas o f comparative advantage.

(ii)

Lessons from Client Surveys and OED Evaluations

65.

Preliminary results of the client survey that was carried out in connection with this CAS
indicate that the Bank’s mission of poverty reduction i s not well understood (see Box 7). I t i s
generally believed that the interests o f the Bank and the Government are not the same and that the Bank
imposes i t s vision of development on Government. However, the Government believes that the Bank can
help strengthen i t s capacity and help i t to formulate realistic action plans. These findings point t o the
need for the B a n k to better communicate i t s vision and strategy and to clearly demonstrate the
relationships between i t s planned activities and the desires o f i t s clients.
Box 7. 2004-2005 Client Survey
Results of the client survey carried out in Gabon in December 2004-January 2005 showed clients and
partners would l i k e the Bank to be more visible, more active in the social sectors, and more diversified in i t s
investments. The survey sample included 300 clients who received written questionnaires and 30 personal
interviews, The interviews included members o f Parliament, other development partners, representatives o f the
private sector and civil society, and local authorities. Overall the client survey was welcomed b y the respondents
as a signal that the Bank might be willing to consult on and consider changes in i t s activities in Gabon.
Preliminary results indicate that the image o f the Bank in Gabon i s rather negative. I t s mission o f poverty
reduction i s not well communicated or understood by the clients. They feel that the Bank does not make adequate
use o f the media and, when organizing information sessions, does not include a l l of i t s partners and clients. It i s
believed that the interests of the Bank and the Govemment are not the same and that the Bank imposes i t s vision of
development on Govemment. The clients also believe that the Govemment does not really have a poverty
reduction strategy nor does it have a clear view of i t s own development goals and priorities.
According to clients, the Bank has not succeeded in establishing effective development partnerships.
While they recognize the achievement of a few micro projects, donor coordination i s seen as insufficient,
particularly on co-financed projects. However, recent efforts to diversify Bank partnerships and activities, to
finance micro-projects in other parts o f Gabon with the participation o f the local authorities and small enterprises,
demonstrate that the Bank i s making progress in these areas.
Clients had many suggestions to make regarding capacity development activities that could be undertaken
by the Bank. The Bank should have a clear policy on t h i s matter, allowing each sector to define i t s own needs and
training program. The Bank should offer more seminars for the administration, NGOs, universities, local
authorities, unions, associations, youth and women. The Bank should also encourage the Govemment to identify
and use existing local capacity. There was a clear interest in NTICs (New Technologies for Information and
Communication), a subject to which local clients felt they could contribute.
Clients acknowledged that Bank communications have greatly improved in the recent past. However, they
are skeptical about the Bank’s new client orientation since they do not have much solid information about the
Bank‘s work program. The Bank i s still believed to operate according to rigid policies and procedures. Bank
procurement, disbursement, and audit rules are not known to the clients. These rules are believed to be complex,
difficult to interpret, and unrealistic in the context o f Gabon. Clients also believe that the competence of local
consultants i s not sufficiently recognized by the Bank. More public information on this subject would be
appreciated.
Clients welcomed the improved relations with other development partners and Bank support for
community micro-projects. However, they felt that the Bank s t i l l has not established good relations with the large
enterprises of the private sector. Bank priorities are not seen as addressing the most important development issues.
This i s a perception the Bank will seek to rectify in i t s outreach activities.

-24-

66.

OED has not conducted a Country Assistance Strategy Evaluation for Gabon.
Implementation Completion Reports for three completed projects have been evaluated b y OED in the last
five years (Transport Sector Technical Assistance, ForestryEnvironment and the Urban LIL). The
overall performance for all three was rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory.
(iii)

Portfolio Management

67.
Portfolio performance, while generally satisfactory, has been uneven. Typically, project
implementation has taken longer than expected, with an average of approximately 6 years. Some projects
were slow to start because after a long period without Bank involvement in the sector, project staff was
unfamiliar with Bank procedures. Timely availability of counterpart funding has been an issue, and the
need for close control of procurement activities has also delayed disbursements. In the case of the
ForestryEnvironment Project, the 1993 devaluation doubled the funds available (and the requirements for
local counterpart funds), contributing to delays in implementation. The Privatization Project and the
Urban LIL closed in June 2004, with a satisfactory performance rating for the Urban LIL. Currently there
i s no World Bank Group active lending portfolio in Gabon, except for IFC’s exposure of US$3.8 million.
68.
New country financing parameters were approved in April 2005, which provide for
increased flexibility in the treatment of cost sharing, taxes, recurrent costs, and local costs (see
Annex 6). This flexibility w i l l enable financing of local costs of investment projects in amounts

appropriate for achieving project development objectives. One-hundred percent Bank financing could be
provided for some projects and activities with strong evidence o f ownership and commitment. Recurrent
cost financing w i l l be considered subject to strong demonstration o f arrangements to ensure sustainability
after Bank financing ceases. Taxes and duties w i l l also be financed provided they are not excessive. The
Bank may finance up to 100 percent of the costs of individual projects; however, in the planned
investment projects (Local Infrastructure Development Project, Infrastructure Project, and Diversification
operation) and the GEF grant, the Bank’s financing share i s likely to be about 90 percent of project costs.
Integration of Bank financing in the budget process (e.g, the Natural Resources Management DPLs) w i l l
ensure that increased recurrent cost financing would not jeopardize overall debt and fiscal sustainability.

B. Partnership and Participation
(i) Partner Roles and Donor Coordination

69.
Since the Bank began strengthening its presence in Gabon, there has been much more
active coordination with the other key development partners on the ground. Bilateral and

multilateral donors meet regularly, and recently thematic groups have been created to improve the
harmonization of donor support. In t h i s context, the present CAS was prepared in close collaboration
with the donor community. Principal development partners include the European Union (EU), the
African Development Bank, France, various UN agencies and Canada, with additional contributions
expected during the CAS period from the US., Spain, and Italy. Much of the bilateral support comes in
the form of technical assistance. The Bank and UNDP are actively involved in the GPRSP process, and
all development partners are prepared to articulate their assistance strategies around the GPRSP program
once i t i s completed and approved.

70.

All operations and activities planned in this CAS will be carried out as a complement to, or
in partnership with other development partners (see Annex 5). As governance i s a key issue in
Gabon, the first pillar of this CAS complements the interventions of France, UNDP, the EU, AfDB, IMF,
UNICEF, and Canada on capacity-building for macroeconomic reforms, public resources management,
statistical capacity-building, and promotion o f the role o f the c i v i l society. The planned Public

-25-

Expenditure Review w i l l be carried out together with the EU, AfDB, and France. There i s also active
coordination between the EU, the Bank and AFDProparco on private sector development and economic
diversification. The Bank has been working with AFD, EU, AfDB, and the U S on the preparation o f the
national forestry and environment program (PSFE), and these partners are also planning to support the
implementation o f the program. On the mining sector, the Bank i s working closely with the EU and
France to improve the legal framework and attract investors in the context of economic diversification,
put in place a regulatory and institutional framework, and improve mining administration capacity. The
same can be said o f infrastructure, where EU, AFD, AfDB and the Bank have collaborated to support the
Government on the creation of a second generation Road maintenance Fund. All of these development
partners have clearly expressed to the Government the need to secure the financing of road maintenance
before considering any new projects in this sector. The Bank coordinates i t s activities with the IMF and
has close collaboration with the Fund on development and implementation of the structural reform
programs. Finally, the World Bank Group works closely with the UN agencies on the fight against
HIV/AIDS.

7 1.

Consultations during the CAS process revealed widespread misunderstanding,
misinformation, and lack of informationabout the Bank’s role in Gabon’s development.
Consultations with civil society and other key stakeholders (Parliamentarians, academics, and the private
sector) began during the preparation of the CASCR in March 2004. These consultations showed that
expectations raised during the 1994-1997 Poverty Assessment and concretized in the 1998 CAS in terms
o f expanded Bank operational support and presence in-country had not been met. More extensive
consultations were held between October and December 2004 on the forthcoming CAS. Fourteen
meetings were held, involving some 400 people, including one meeting with Parliamentarians led by the
Country Director. Most of the meetings were held in Libreville, but meetings were also held in Port
Gentil and Franceville (see Annex 3).

72.
The outcomes of the CASCR and CAS consultations and the Client Survey are similar, even
though different clients were consulted during each exercise. Many clients and civil society members
s t i l l wish the Bank to support the Government in providing welfare services, with little understanding o f
the sustainability and external debt implications. Improvements in the management o f public resources
and in the climate for private investment are prerequisites for success in other areas, and the Bank has a
comparative advantage in working with Gabon in these areas. These views were shared by key decision
makers in Government who do understand the problems and the role that World Bank Group support
(including IBRD borrowing) should play. In some instances other development partners are better placed
to assist Gabon in improving service delivery, often with grant resources. The client survey and
consultations illustrate the need to better communicate the Bank’s strategy, demonstrating how
improvements in the management of both fiscal resources and natural resources w i l l contribute to
achieving the country’s development goals in a sustainable manner.
C. The World Bank Group Assistance Strategy
(i) Strategic Focus and Selectivity

73.

The Bank broadly shares the Government’s development goals and objectives. In
consultation with the Government and other development partners, the Bank has identified two areas of
comparative advantage for i t s assistance program. Both areas (or “pillars”) contribute to the central crosscutting themes o f capacity development and governance. The first pillar o f the CAS i s strengthening the
management o f public resources (both natural and financial) for improved social outcomes. The second i s
improving the investment climate to foster sustainable, private-sector-led growth. The pillars w i l l be
supported b y the Bank through a combination o f lending and non-lending activities, as shown in Table 8.

This represents an entry point for HIV/AIDS, to assist the Government to implement funds from other sources (e.g., the
Global Fund), and manage their National HN/AIDS strategy. I t i s unclear if the Government would consider using IBRD to
finance an operation, but this option will be kept under review.

15
NGOParliamentaryCapacity Building will be supported through an increased number of consultations with civil
society; a targeted effort to increase learning opportunities, through WBI for example, and possibly an IDF grant.
16

The mining sector work will review the mining law, including specifically the environmental and regulatory
requirements in the mining sector.
17
The planned Diversificationoperation could build on the FIAS and IFR recommendations act as an umbrella for natural
resource transparency and accountability in other sectors.

-27-

74.

The main criteria for selecting Bank interventions under the CAS have been whether or not
the planned activity supports the two pillars, and whether or not the Bank i s best placed to provide
the needed assistance. The CAS includes, in addition to substantial non-lending support, three targeted

lending operations that support both strategic pillars. The US$25 million Local Infrastructure
Development Project expected for Board presentation in June 2005, i s designed to develop small-scale
infrastructure in response to community needs and to instill transparent financing and public works
contracting practices. Through the planned Natural Resources Management D P L in FY06 (US$15
million), the Bank w i l l support the establishment of transparent natural resource governance and law
enforcement practices in the forest sectors, capitalizing on the recent wave of reforms and opening the
door for similar reforms in the fisheries and mining sector. This operation w i l l also help improve the
environment for investment b y leveling the playing field and providing clear rules o f access to investment
opportunities (e.g. auctioning of forest permits). The US$10 million GEF grant w i l l support the
sustainable management and development of Gabon’s national parks. The US$25 million Infrastructure
Project planned for FY08 w i l l be designed to improve the management of basic infrastructure to meet
transport needs in the country and w i l l be complementary to other partners’ programs. In the H i g h Case,
a FY09 US$18 million Diversification support operation w i l l build on the recommendations of planned
advisory work provided through FIAS, IFR, and EITI, and w i l l develop the capacity of Gabon’s private
sector to contribute to economic growth. A FY08 Natural Resources Management DPL w i l l build on the
progress in the forest sector, and pursue improved practices in the fisheries, and mining sector.

Pillar 1: Strengthening the management of public resources (both natural and financial) for
improved social outcomes

Improving efficiency and equity in public expenditures

75.

The main instrument to achieve this outcome will be a combined Public Expenditure
ReviewKountry Financial Accountability AssessmentlCountry Procurement and Audit Review,
planned for completion in FY06. The aim of t h i s activity i s to improve public expenditure management
and control systems, ensuring that allocated funds are used for the purposes they were intended and that
they achieve the expected results. I t i s also expected that the exercise would incorporate a focus on
poverty analysis, based on the results of the CWIQ survey and the GPRSP. The process i s planned to

reinforce early implementation of the GPRSP by aligning budget planning to the GPRSP objectives. This
exercise w i l l be reinforced by statistical capacity development activities to improve governance and
accountability and measure progress in achieving results.

76.
The implementation of the recommendations of the combined P E W C F A A K P A R report
will be followed up through continuing dialogue between Government, other participating donors,
the Bank and the IMF. A PER limited to expenditures in infrastructure across sectors, was carried out
in 2000/2001 under the Urban LIL. Among the findings, three are o f particular interest in the context o f
more than 50 percent o f the public investment program (PIP) i s allocated to
the current exercise: (i)
infrastructure, but the execution rate i s very l o w (less than 20 percent of infrastructure projects were
given the significance o f infrastructure in the
actually carried out among those identified in the PIP); (ii)
PIP, the PER made some specific recommendations on how to carry out forthcoming PERs with a
particular focus on infrastructure; and (iii)
due to the l o w execution ratio, much attention i s needed in the
management of public expenditures and public works contracts, which i s one o f the objectives of the new
Local Infrastructure Development Project. The last recommendation i s particularly important for
ensuring the sustainability o f SMEs, as contracts have suffered from poor management in the past (e.g.,
delays in payments of greater than 250 days).

-28-

77.

Under the Local Infrastructure Development Project (US$25 million) expected to be
presented to the Board in June 2005, the capacity of local Governments and community groups will
be strengthened to address local needs with their own resources. This would help relieve an
unsustainable burden on central Government. The project has been prepared b y PAPSUT, a semiautonomous technical unit under the Ministry of Planning and Economy. PAPSUT was previously
responsible for the successful implementation of the Transport Sector Technical Assistance Project
(approved in FY95 and closed in FYOO), under which strategies were prepared for transport and urban
sectors, and for the Urban LIL which tested key policy features of the urban strategy. This technical unit
has now acquired considerable experience in promoting community-based upgrading of poor urban
neighborhoods in Gabon.

78.
Through consultation and training programs, the Bank will help strengthen the role of
Parliament and civil society to monitor resource revenues and public expenditures. Capacity
development exercises and continued information sharing through consultation w i l l help civil society
acquire more effective ways and means to exercise their oversight role (for example, by participating in
the EITI consultative committee, the Forestry oversight body, forest zoning processes and the
management o f community forests, and the public disclosure of relevant information, as well as the Urban
WBI support w i l l be mobilized to provide training to
Project’s community consultations).
Parliamentarians and civil society leaders. An IDF grant w i l l also be sought for t h i s purpose.
Improving revenue mobilization and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources

79.
Under the EITI, the Bank will support government efforts to increase the share of oil
revenues transferred to the Treasury (see Box 4). The intermediate output of EITI w i l l be the
publication o f a report comparing all relevant extractive industry revenues received b y Government with
amounts paid b y E1 companies, in a readily accessible and easily understandable format. An independent
audit will ensure the integrity of the exercise, and appropriate legal, institutional, and financial
arrangements w i l l be put in place to ensure the sustainability o f the process. The Bank w i l l continue to
provide advice and assistance to the Government in the various steps of the implementation process by
providing information on the EITI, advising on the design o f the associated information campaign,
facilitating the dialogue with other stakeholders (civil society, companies), sharing other countries’
implementation experience, and providing comments on the reporting template and procedure.
80.
The expected benefit of EITI will include an improved business environment, hence greater
attractiveness of Gabon as an investment destination in the o i l and gas and mining sector. In addition, the
participatory approach involved in the Initiative w i l l help initiate a broad-based debate on better use o f the
country’s natural resources. The training associated with the implementation of the Initiative will help
improve the ability of the Executive to devise sector policies and of Parliament to oversee the
implementation of these policies.
8 1.
The two Natural Resources Management Development Policy Loans (FY06, US$15 million
and FY08, US$10 million) planned for the CAS period, will help to cement the implementation of
reforms for more efficient, transparent and sustainable exploitation of natural resources, thereby
also contributing to public revenue mobilization. The first operation w i l l build on the significant
recent reforms already achieved in the forest sector (see paragraph 49), including the implementation o f
the reform agenda set forth in the 2004 Forestry Letter o f Sector Policy which requires overcoming longtime vested interests. The operation w i l l help continue to improve tax collection from the forestry sector,
and w i l l also lay the groundwork for future revenue growth from fishing and mining. Related key areas
for improvement in managing natural resources which the operation w i l l assist in implementing are: (a)
improving pricing mechanisms and transparency in allocating and managing exploitation rights, licenses
and concessions; (b) securing collection of fiscal revenues; (c) managing the resource base sustainably;
-29-

and (d) monitoring and enforcing contracts and laws, and applying penalties to reduce the appeal of noncompliance and secure a level-playing field. The choice of development policy loan as the instrument of
Bank assistance i s based on the desirability of linking financial support to implementation o f reforms.
The planned program w i l l strengthen the voice of reformers and increase their capacity to overcome
resistance from vested interests. The choice of two DPLs for natural resources management, with the
second being in the High Case, w i l l also help mitigate the risk of waning reform momentum.

82.
The Natural Resources Management DPLs are also a f i r s t step in support of the
Government’s efforts to build a sustainable and responsible fisheries sector and to complement
activities of other development partners in the sector, such as AfDB, EU and Japan. The operations
would focus on: upstream analysis to prepare a coherent strategy for the sector’s management and
development; effective implementation of fisheries governance; greater transparency in order to lay the
groundwork for sustainable management of fish stocks; building awareness o f responsible fisheries; and
building the human and institutional capacity required to effectively manage the sector.
Completing and implementing the GPRSP

83.
The Bank will continue to support the GPRSP process by participating in the final stages of
preparation and the early stages of implementation, in collaboration with other development
partners and civil society. The focus of Bank assistance w i l l continue to be expanding public
participation in the process, improving the poverty database, supporting the development of statistical
capacity, and developing mechanisms for future monitoring and evaluation, including strengthening their
results-based orientation. These activities w i l l be expanded and strengthened over time as the momentum
of GPRSP implementation picks up.
84.
As part of this program, a new Poverty Assessment would be undertaken for completion in
FY09. This assessment w i l l provide the basis for a more reliable analysis than was possible under the
first Poverty Assessment. Together with the programs and sectoral strategies to be developed under the
GPRSP, i t w i l l provide a stronger foundation for directing resources to poverty alleviation under the
successor to t h i s CAS.
Addressing the challenge of HZV/AZDS

85.
The Bank will seek to mobilize an IDF grant in FY06 to support institutional capacity
development for the implementation of the National Strategy to Fight HIV/AIDS. The grant would
be used to help strengthen government capacity to deploy resources secured from the Global Fund for
HIV/AIDS control and prevention, to manage these resources efficiently, and to mobilize additional
assistance.
Pillar 2: Improving the investment climate to foster sustainable, private sector-led growth

Improving the investment climate

86.
The principal instruments for achieving this outcome will be the IFR and FIAS studies and
implementation of their recommendations, together with monitoring critical business indicators. A
first phase study has been conducted (see Box 1) and the Government has already held a workshop to
agree on an action plan for implementing the recommendations. Work on the investment climate would
also, as needed, address the remaining financial sector issues (see paragraph 23). In addition, the
Government has set up a Good Governance Commission that i s designing a comprehensive
Governance/Rule of L a w Strategy. Government i s actively exploring donor interest in supporting,
technically and financially, some of the components and activities of t h i s strategy. Several donor-funded
initiatives (AfDB, IMF, EU, and Canada) have components that address governance issues as well.
-30-

87.
In a high-case lending scenario (see paragraph 102), preparation of an operation to support
diversification and associated capacity development would be undertaken during the CAS period.
Aside from policy and institutional reforms, possible components of such an operation would include
capacity development initiatives for the private sector in selected growth sectors, including oil, mining
and timber-related industries, and tourism where public and private partners w i l l agree on specific
measures to accelerate growth. In this context, the Government has expressed interest in replicating
Bank-assisted experiences in supporting export diversification in other countries, such as Tunisia.
88.
The diversification agenda will need to be accompanied by regulatory changes as well as
technical skills upgrading in critical industry sectors. An overhaul of Gabonese technical training
institutes and mechanisms to re-tool labor are needed as part o f the investment climate reform. The
MIGA guarantee supporting the vocational training project w i l l support this need. International
experience shows that the collaboration of the private sector in the implementation o f national
competitiveness enhancing measures i s essential. To facilitate t h i s collaboration, a private-public
dialogue platform would need to be established. Government's capacity in economic planning and policy
making needs to b e strengthened, as well as the information base for such policies. Capacity development
and streamlining o f public sector functions in economic policy-making are equally important. Under the
planned Diversification operation, appropriate resources w i l l also be earmarked for activities aimed at
strengthening the functioning o f Gabon's law and justice sector.
89.
The two Natural Resources Management DPLs will help create more favorable conditions
for future private investment in sustainable forestry and wood transformation industries. In
addition, i t w i l l support the policy reforms and administrative capacity development needed to encourage
future private investment in sustainable fisheries and mining. Parallel initiatives for biodiversity-related
tourism activities w i l l be supported through a GEF grant for the National Parks. Through t h i s instrument
of support, the Bank w i l l help Gabon improve the incentive framework for attracting socially and
environmentally responsible investors and creating more jobs, especially in the forest sector. The two
operations w i l l also support the promotion of national entrepreneurship, small-scale enterprises, and
community forests. The potential of biodiversity and national parks to support the emergence o f a
Gabonese eco-tourism industry and create jobs in rural areas s t i l l needs to be developed. In addition, by
removing distortions and encouraging law enforcement the two DPLs w i l l contribute towards a levelplaying field for private sector development in the forest, fisheries and mining sectors.
90.
Ways to strengthen the environment for public private partnership in infrastructure
development will be analyzed in an Infrastructure Framework Report scheduled for FY06. Based
on successful implementation of the recommendations from t h i s report, it would be followed by an
Infrastructure operation o f some US$25 million in FY08.
91.
The Mining Sector Review and support for EITI implementation will help to improve
overall sector governance and efficiency and sustainability of investments in the mining sector. In
addition i t w i l l assist with setting up and improving a framework and mechanisms for benefits sharing,
and for the development of local communities. This Mining Sector Review, which would be undertaken
only in a high-case lending scenario and would build on recent informal work by the World Bank Group
on the mining sector, would promote the organization and formalization o f artisanal and small-scale
mining and encourage socially and environmentally responsible practices. Under the High Case lending
scenario, these non-lending activities would be followed by lending for a second Development Policy
Loan (US$lO million) for Natural Resources Management, and a Diversification support operation
(US$18 million, FY09).

Building local capacity in the private sector

92.
The Local Infrastructure Development Project will help develop capacity among small
private contractors to carry out small-scale construction activities financed by neighborhood
groups and local Governments. The Project w i l l continue strengthening the s k i l l s of local contractors
and consultants, and w i l l assist them to find steady employment by earmarking portions o f the Public
Investment Program to be awarded through local competitive bidding for implementation by small
contractors.
(ii) Regional Dimension of the World Bank Group Strategy

93.

I t i s important for Gabon to continue to exercise its leadership and to honor its
commitments to the sub-region. Gabon’s rich reserves and prime coastal location give i t a fundamental
role in continuing to improve the depth of regional integration in the CEMAC region. First, Gabon w i l l
need to help ensure that the CEMAC macroeconomic convergence criteria continue to be adhered to and
that the system o f multilateral surveillance functions effectively. Second, Gabon, together with
Cameroon, w i l l have to ensure that large transit taxes and administrative barriers to trade are
progressively dismantled, and that transport logistics are strengthened (or facilitated), in order to improve
the efficiency of the sub regional transit corridors and to protect the interests of the landlocked countries.
Third, Gabon w i l l need to honor i t s commitments to the regional compensation fund, which was set up to
compensate the poorer, land-locked countries (e.g., the Central African Republic and Chad) for the loss o f
tariff revenues when they joined the CEMAC union. Finally, Gabon can act as a facilitator for subregional projects and initiatives in order to accelerate the momentum of regional integration.

D. Scenarios and Triggers

94.
Gabon i s currently in the Base Case, based on the sustained recent improvements in
macroeconomic and fiscal management under the IMF-supported program, and parallel progress
in implementing reforms and GPRSP preparation. In the Base Case, the lending program planned for
FY05 to FY09 i s around US$65 million, together with US$11.5 million in IDF and GEF grants. Lending
in FY05 includes the US$25 million Local Infrastructure Development Project which builds on the
successful experience of the Urban LIL. The first US$15 million Natural Resources Management
Development Policy Loan (DPL) in support of the 2004 Letter of Sector Policy i s planned for FY06,
associated with a US$10 million GEF grant which would support the sustainable management and
development of Gabon’s national parks. A US$25 million Infrastructure Project i s planned in FY08 in
response to the client’s request to receive Bank assistance to improve dilapidated infrastructure, notably
roads. The Bank’s support w i l l complement projects financed under other donor programs, and will focus
notably on the enabling policy and institutional framework for infrastructure services. Finalization o f the
project w i l l be predicated on measures to ensure i t s success being in place (e.g., a working second
generation road fund). In addition, three IDF grants of US$500,000 each would be sought in FY06 and
institutional capacity development for the implementation of the National Strategy to
FY07 to support (i)
Fight HIV/AIDS; (ii)
capacity development to monitor the GPRSP; and (iii)
capacity development for
parliamentarians and civil society.

-32-

95.
Non-lending activities in the Base Case include continuing support for GPRSP preparation,
public financial management, private sector development, and capacity development. Specifically,
informal work will include monitoring the macroeconomic environment, strengthening statistical
capacity, and providing support for the national GPRSP process. Building on the Bank’s current
involvement, this support w i l l focus on improving the quality of poverty data, building a performance
monitoring and evaluation system with enhanced results focus, and improving the scope and effectiveness
o f public consultations. The Country Office w i l l continue to provide leadership in disseminating
information about the Bank’s program and carrying on continuing consultations with all relevant
stakeholders, including development partners. Scheduled AAA outputs include, in FY05, the first-phase
FIAS study (already completed) to improve the business environment, and support for the implementation
o f the EITI. Planned FY06 outputs include second- and third- phase FIAS studies, an Infrastructure
Framework Report, continued support for EITI implementation (leading to the publication of EITI
compliant revenue reports), and a combined Public Expenditure Review, Country Financial
Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement and Audit Review, as well as support from W B I for
NGO capacity development. In FY09, the Bank would continue support to N G O and Parliamentary
capacity development and the GPRSP implementation process, and assist the Government in completing
a comprehensive assessment of poverty.

96.
Up to now, IFC’s direct investments have been modest, and have mainly involved natural
resources operations where Gabon has a competitive advantage. IFC cumulative commitments in
Gabon total US$226 million and have been in oil development, mining and pulp and paper. IFC also
advised on the successful privatization of SEEG, the National Electricity and Water Company. In line
a proactive role
with i t s strategic initiative for Africa, IFC’s program i s centered on three major pillars: (i)
in the pursuit of direct investments; (ii)
active support to enhance the business environment; and (iii)
enhanced support to SMEs. In addition to the existing projects, IFC has a portfolio exposure for direct
investments in Vaalco (a small offshore o i l project) and Olam (a multi-country trading sector investment
that includes forestry activities in Gabon). IFC i s currently processing a regional US$18 million
infrastructure financing operation for a company whose largest operation i s in Gabon, and a proposed
US$35 million financing for o i l production expansion project with Vaalco. While the future focus w i l l be
on infrastructure and support to the sustainable development of the country’s natural resources, I F C plans
to enhance i t s field promotion activities in order to pursue bankable opportunities regardless o f sector.
97.
There i s potential for IFC to play an increasing role in the promotion of small and medium
enterprises in Gabon. IFC’s most recent contribution on the SME front has included the delivery of
nine training programs to women entrepreneurs, in collaboration with Gabon’s national employment
office. Further involvement i s being considered following the phase-out o f the Africa Project
Development Facility (APDF) and the introduction of Private Enterprise Partnerships for Africa (PEP
Africa). PEP Africa w i l l be a more sector-focused initiative where new programs w i l l be designed and
prioritized based on criteria such as impact, integration with direct investment activities, and support from
local authorities. Although in the short term direct investments w i l l be IFC’s primary focus in Gabon,
over the medium term IFC w i l l rely also on the contribution o f FIAS to the improvement of the business
environment. I t should be noted that given Gabon’s status of “resource-rich’’ country with more than 50
percent of government revenues coming from extractive industries, favorable consideration by IFC of
investments in the oil, gas, and forestry sectors also depends on the country’s progress in improving
transparency in the extractive industries. Government engagement in the EITI process i s an important
step forward in t h i s respect.

-33-

98.
Gabon became a member of M I G A in 2003. Since then, two projects have been presented to
MIGA for consideration. One, the US$61 million Vocational Training Centers Rehabilitation Project, i s
expected to be presented to the Board in May 2005. This project i s MIGA’s first in the education sector.

99.
Other development partners plan lending and grant support in areas that complement the
Bank’s areas of comparative advantage (see Annex 5). Major lending by other development partners
foreseen for the CAS period includes €14 million from AFD (France) for priority drainage and sanitation
improvements in Libreville, and €33.5 million from the African Development Bank (€20 million for
improving technical and professional education, and €13.5 million to support the social costs o f
privatization). AFD i s also interested in investing in the mining, forestry, fisheries, and transport sectors.
The AfDB i s considering additional support to improve the business environment in the wake o f
privatization. Apart from these projects, most o f the planned donor support w i l l come in the form o f
grants, including substantial amounts from the EU, GEF, and France in support of forestry and
biodiversity initiatives, rural water supply, education and health services, improved governance, and
capacity development.
100. The above work program corresponds to the Base Case, which would be marked in
particular by Gabon maintaining satisfactory macroeconomic performance and continued progress
on the key sectoral reform agenda, notably in forestry. Under t h i s scenario, i t i s expected that the
GPRSP would be completed and approved b y Government and by Parliament before the CAS Mid-Term
Review. Criteria for remaining in the Base Case would be:
0

Satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evidenced by, inter alia, a successor arrangement
with the IMF following the expiration of the Stand-By in June 2005 and continued satisfactory
performance under such an arrangement;
Continued progress in the implementation o f the forest reform agenda as evidenced notably b y
continued implementation of the moratorium on allocation o f new permits until the new
transparent auction procedures are implemented.

In addition, even if the base-case criteria continue to be met, moving forward with the planned € T O 8
Infrastructure project would require that a working second-generation road fund be in place.

101. Failure to meet the above criteria would trigger the Low Case. The L o w Case would involve
no new lending and a reduced level of AAA support. However, the Bank would continue to support the
GPRSP process and civil society consultation and capacity development activities of the Country Office.
An IDF for HIV/AIDS would s t i l l be sought in FY06.
102. The High Case would involve a modulated approach. In the first instance, if a track record o f
satisfactory performance in the Base Case i s established and, beyond this, significant progress on reforms
in the natural resources sector i s made, a second Natural Resources Management DPL (US$lO million)
would be prepared for Board presentation in FY08. This operation would help sustain and further deepen
transparency and accountability in natural resources management. Inputs for this project would include
the Mining Sector Report in FY07. Criteria for moving forward with this operation would be:
0

0

Full and effective abolition of SNBG export monopoly b y January 2006, following the decision
that was taken by Government to this effect in December 2004 (see paragraph 49);
Full implementation of EITI as evidenced by publication of the reconciled reports of payments
and revenues audited by an independent auditor, as well as establishment of an EITI compliant
mechanism for civil society oversight (see Box 4).

-34-

103. In the High Case, assuming performance continues to be satisfactory and conditions to
accelerate improvement in the business climate are met, a Diversification operation (US$18 million)
would be prepared for Board presentation in FY09. This operation would act as an umbrella to
promote diversification and job creation in non-oil sectors (both natural- resource-based and others).
Inputs for this project would include the second and third phase of the FIAS report, as well as the
Infrastructure Framework Report. Criteria for moving forward with t h i s operation would be:
0

0

Completion of the privatization of Gabon Telecom as evidenced by the conclusion of a transfer
agreement; and
Implementation of FIAS first-phase main recommendations (see Box 1) on procurement and
property rights:
(i) Regular publication of public procurement opportunities and contract awards, or
implementing an equivalent measure to improve transparency in procurement
proposed by the joint PEFUCFAA/CPAR; and
(ii) Clarifying procedures and reducing delays to secure definitive real estate titles, and
informing the public of the revised procedures.

104. Monitoring and Evaluation. The relationship between government goals and objectives, Bank
objectives, instruments, outputs and outcomes are shown in the Results Matrix in Annex 1. Progress
toward achieving the outcome indicators w i l l be followed b y the Country Office twice-yearly through
systematized consultations and review of national economic and poverty indicators. A mid-term CAS
review w i l l be undertaken and a progress report prepared b y early FY07 (earlier if warranted). On the
basis of this review, a move to the high-case lending scenario would be considered if the assessment
justifies it.
105. The World Bank Group’s work program will be coordinated with those of the other
development partners, through the GPRSP process, sector-wide operations, and ongoing communication
and consultation with other development partners present in Gabon, who also see capacity development
as a key objective. The monitoring and evaluation system proposed in the GPRSP, once implemented,
w i l l serve to monitor future government performance on an agreed basis for the entire donor community.
106. Bank Exposure. The portfolio r i s k s are manageable in the CAS period. Creditworthiness
indicators are moving in the right direction although the preferred creditor ratio w i l l continue to increase
due to bilateral debt being paid down and new financing from bilateral sources principally in the form o f
grants. T o mitigate this risk new IBRD lending w i l l be aligned to continuity of reform, including those in
the forestry, mining and fisheries sector.

VI. MANAGING
RISK

107. A key external risk affecting the ability of this CAS to achieve the desired results would be a
sharp drop in petroleum prices. This would undermine government revenues and put the country at
risk of being unable to meet i t s commitments to the IMF and the Paris Club. Conversely, the persistence
of high o i l prices (above US$40 per barrel) could reduce the incentive for transparency and trigger a shift
to the low-case scenario. The current outlook i s for world petroleum prices to remain stable (at the
average o f last year’s levels), though there may be short-term fluctuations due to temporary imbalances
between supply and demand. A related risk has to do with the ability o f Gabon to maintain i t s current
production levels. Production i s projected to decline and these projections have been taken into account
in establishing the medium-term framework. The risk of a sharper decline i s relatively small, whereas the
upside risk o f discovering new reserves or new ways of increasing petroleum production from current
fields i s more significant.
108. There i s a risk that Gabon’s debt burden would again become unsustainable. The debt
burden of Gabon i s substantial, but the country has recently improved i t s overall debt management
strategy, particularly through Paris Club rescheduling, and the planned IBRD lending w i l l not materially
affect the country’s debt position. The assumptions underlying the medium-term outlook however, are
extremely sensitive to the development of oil production and prices and to non-oil output growth. I f o i l
revenue windfalls are applied to debt reduction, this w i l l help mitigate the risk that the debt burden would
again become unsustainable. Continued donor coordination, as well as IMF oversight, should help to
ensure that the Government does not embark on financing o f overly large investment projects or again
become involved in unsustainable borrowing.

109. A key internal risk i s a departure from the recently-recovered sound fiscal management
practices, which may occur in the context of the upcoming Presidential election or for other reasons.
This could also disrupt relations with the IMF and limit the ability of the Treasury to meet budget
requirements, with a consequent reduction in public expenditures for poverty alleviation or other
development purposes. To mitigate this risk, the Bank and the IMF w i l l seek to maintain a constant
dialogue with Government to ensure that public expenditures remain on track. Failure in t h i s area would
mean that Gabon would move to a L o w Case and would receive less support from the Bank. At the
project level, training for project staff and effective supervision should maintain portfolio performance in
satisfactory status. The PER-related exercise in FY06 should also help reduce the risk of delays in
counterpart funding.
110. A related risk i s that the commitment of Government to structural reforms will falter
and/or that vested interests will succeed in preventing such reforms from being implemented.
Currently, in part owing to the increasing urgency of o i l reserve depletion and o f diversifying the
country’s sources of income, a critical mass o f government commitment to reform implementation i s
apparent, with leadership from the senior-most authorities. Success in privatizing public enterprises,
bringing the debt problem under control, gradually improving the transparency of forest resource
management, and restoring the Road Fund has strengthened the hand o f the reformers in Government.
And unless the upcoming Presidential election brings about major change in the policy direction espoused
by the current administration, an eventuality viewed b y most political observers as unlikely, government
commitment to the ongoing reform process i s likely to be strengthened rather than weakened over the
next five years. Technocrats, particularly younger ones, are increasingly aware that reforms are necessary
to avoid a progressive undermining o f the system and to preserve social peace, which i s viewed as
increasingly fragile in many circles. A stronger role for Parliament, the private sector, and civil society
w i l l also help to hold the Government more accountable. This role w i l l be underpinned b y Bank and
other donor activities to support improved governance and capacity development.

-36-

111. There i s nevertheless some risk that the upcoming Presidential election would result in a
major change of Government, bringing a new set of stakeholders to the table and slowing the pace
of reform. While this risk i s considered to be small, in the event that i t does occur, the Bank would
undertake extensive consultations with members of the new Government to determine i t s commitment to
the strategy outlined in the present CAS and the appropriate course of action for the Bank to pursue.
VIII. CONCLUDINGREMARKS

112. Gabon i s facing a great challenge. Replacing declining petroleum production with other sources
of income w i l l prove difficult: Gabon w i l l have to dramatically increase the efficiency with which i t uses
i t s existing public resources; i t w i l l also need to improve the business climate to foster private investment
in the non-oil sectors. The World Bank Group has been asked to help Gabon implement the right policies
to ensure that the current window of opportunity - clear signs of commitment on the part of the country’s
top leadership to sound macroeconomic management and to implement difficult, far-reaching reforms - i s
not lost. In partnership with other development partners, the Gabonese civil society and private sector,
the World Bank Group i s well-placed to help Gabon succeed in diversifying i t s economy and improving
social outcomes.

ANNEX 2. Capacity Buildingfor Parliamentarians
Challenges: The Gabonese Parliament faces challenges in terms of i t s capacity to voice i t s
constituents’ needs and i t s contribution to designing and overseeing government-led initiatives.
The first challenge i s political: in both chambers, the ruling party (Parti Democratique Gabonais
(PDG) holds an overwhelming majority of seats. The remaining seats are held by weak opposition
parties or parties that have allied with the PDG. Substantial amendments to government-submitted
laws are rare, i t s policies are hardly ever questioned and very few legislative propositions are
introduced by the Parliament. The credibility o f both chambers i s therefore weakened, particularly
that o f the Senate which was created in 1996 and i s perceived as a venue for retired friends of the
ruling regime. Their capacity to represent their constituent’s needs and concerns i s questioned.
The lack of information available to the Parliamentarians constitutes a second challenge. They are
poorly informed on key issues (such as NEPAD, the GPRSP process, and the HIPC initiative,
including eligibility criteria) and on Government policies. Parliamentarians do not have easy access
to negotiated agreements between the Government and third parties and are not aware o f the
international institutions’ procedures and follow-up mechanisms. This situation undermines the
Parliament’s ability to question the executive and it also weakens i t s role of communicating and
explaining policies and issues to member constituencies.
The lack of institutional training of the members of Parliament represents a third challenge. Some
members do not have a lot of experience in parliamentary procedure or in dealing with policy issues
and are not fully aware of their functions and responsibility. Some members o f the Finance
Committee lack the necessary training to analyze the budget.

Bank Response
The Bank plans to assist the Parliamentarians by enhancing their capacity to shape public policy and
represent the population through programs supported b y WBI and/or the Country Office. These
programs w i l l consist o f
1.

Organize roundtables with both Chambers of Parliament to present the Bank, i t s procedures,
and i t s relationship with Government and c i v i l society. The members of Parliament asked for a
sustained dialogue with the Bank during the CAS consultations. Quarterly meetings were
suggested.

2.

Finance training programs for Parliamentarians (on how to read a budget, on good governance,
on control mechanisms, on issues relating to responsibilities, etc.). Previous field visits to other
countries have been much appreciated b y the Parliamentarians who find them useful in terms of
networking, knowledge-building and information gathering.

3.

Encourage the Government to thoroughly involve Members of Parliament in the formulation
and implementation of the GPRSP.

4.

Assist Parliamentarians to better represent the interests of citizens in the policy process,
particularly in the context of the GPRSP.

5.

Promote dialogue and interaction between C i v i l Society Organizations and members of
Parliament.

6.

Assist in strengthening the internal organization o f Parliament (for example, strengthening
committee system, investing in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) so as to
improve the research capacity o f Parliamentarians).

7.

Enhance public awareness o f the role o f Parliamentarians.

8.

Support and coordinate actions towards Parliamentary capacity-building undertaken b y other
donors (UNDP for example).
-41-

ANNEX 3. CAS Consultations
The consultations for the CAS 2005-2008 were carried out between October 27, and December
20, 2004. Fourteen meetings were held in which more than 410 people participated. The reasons behind
this very extensive consultation process were two-fold: first, the World Bank wanted to obtain a wide
range of views and opinions from all sectors of society on the development needs and issues faced b y the
country and on suggestions on how the Bank could assist in addressing those needs. Second, the Bank
sought to respond to the necessity made apparent in the evaluation of the previous CAS (1998-2004) o f
making itself more known on the ground and extending i t s outreach.
The groups consulted included members of the Government, the Senate, the National Assembly
and the Judiciary. The Bank also organized a significant number o f meetings with civil society (nongovernmental organizations, associations, unions, academia, private sector and the media). I t was decided
to hold separate meetings with national business associations and foreign employers, although both
representing the private sector, as their concerns differ extensively. The Social and Economic Council, a
constitutionally-entrenched advisory council composed of high-level representatives from every sector o f
society also took part in one meeting.
In addition, the Bank sought the opinion of Gabonese residing outside the capital. Two
consultations took place in cities in the interior of the country, in both cases with a cross-section of
stakeholders. The first one was held in Port-Gentil, Gabon’s second most important city and the country’s
petroleum and financial capital. The other was held in Franceville, Gabon’s third main city and the center
o f the country’s mineral industry. Besides representing Gabon’s economic poles, these two cities were
pertinent for the consultation process as they are both beneficiaries of Bank-financed projects.

The consultations, conducted by the Country Representative, were facilitated by a highlyrespected member of civil society. The Country Director, on a mission from Washington, was present for
the meeting with the National Assembly. The feedback from the consultations has been shared with the
government whose representatives participated in some o f the events.
Each o f the consultations followed the same process. Either the Country Representative or the
Resident Economist made a short presentation explaining the strategic pillars of the draft CAS 20052008, i t s measurements and the risks that could impede i t s implementation. A brief presentation o f the
workings of the World Bank and a report of the conclusions of the last CAS (1998-2004) were also
included in the presentation. A discussion followed, aimed at obtaining feedback on (1) the pertinence of
the proposed Bank interventions to assist the Government’s ongoing efforts to diversify the economy,
generate employment in the private sector and address poverty; (2) the appropriateness o f the proposed
assistance scenarios and triggers; and (3) whether the development of a stronger civil society constitutes a
means to increase transparency, good governance and better planning for social services delivery.
T o summarize briefly the main conclusions of the consultations, the direction and pillars of the
draft CAS were broadly endorsed. However, the participants emphasized the need to improve the
education system, invest in roads, develop the agriculture sector and curve the spread o f HIV/AIDS. In
addition, the people consulted repeatedly asked the Bank to establish a direct partnership with civil
society, without the involvement of the Government of which they distrust the capacity and w i l l to
implement development-related projects and reforms. Because the World Bank’s presence in the country
has not been sustained over the last decade, the participants also took the opportunity to voice their
questions and concerns regarding the World Bank, i t s procedures and i t s relationship with the
Government. I t was thus an occasion for the Gabonese to air grievances and for the World Bank to
explain misunderstandings. I t was agreed that the Bank needed to extend the dialogue and the outreach
and inform the public of i t s activities in Gabon.
-42-

Overall, the stakeholders consulted appreciated the fact that they could express their concerns and
give suggestions directly to representatives of the World Bank. This enthusiastic response to the
consultations made i t clear that a more systematic and sustained participatory process was in demand
within c i v i l society and was necessary to achieve the proposed goals.
See the table below for a detailed description of the points discussed during each consultation, the
comments regarding the Bank’s involvement in Gabon as well as the underlying issues that shaped the
orientation of the debate.

Background
Gabon i s a country of some 268,000 km2with a population currently estimated at 1.3 million. An
estimated 75% o f the population i s concentrated in two cities (Libreville, pop. 450,000, and Port Gentil,
pop. 100,000) and some 50 smaller towns. The country i s rich in natural resources, including petroleum,
manganese and other minerals, and tropical forests. The rural areas are virtually empty (population
density <2 persons/km2) as many residents have migrated to urban centers in order to access public
services and to participate in an economy based largely on the redistribution o f rents from resource
extraction. The country has also received a significant stream of migrants from other countries along the
coast, who are active in the formal and informal sectors o f the economy. There i s a significant presence
of foreign investors, mainly French, who have developed the nation’s natural resources in partnership
with the Government.
Located on the west coast of former French Equatorial Africa, Gabon has played a strategic role
in maintaining peace and stability in that region since i t s independence in 1960. Gabon has experienced
extraordinary continuity in i t s domestic political regime. I t s Independence hero and first president, Leon
M’ba, died in office in 1967. The presidency was then assumed by Albert-Bernard Bongo (now known as
El Hadj Omar Bongo Ondimba), the leader of the nation’s single political party. In 1990 a new
constitution was approved, establishing a multiparty system of democracy. President Bongo was reelected in 1993 and again in 1998. In addition to maintaining relative social peace internally, the regime
maintains close links to France and has played an important part in mediating conflicts in neighboring
countries. Gabon aspires to become a leader in the emerging Central African economic community.
Gabon i s a rich country by African standards. With a GNP equivalent to about U S $4 billion,
Gabon’s per capita income i s over $3,000, making i t ineligible for IDA borrowing. Revenues are derived
largely from petroleum exports, with additional contributions from manganese mining, wood and wood
products. Agriculture adds less than 10% to GDP, with the balance about evenly divided between
industry and services. During the o i l boom o f 1973 to 1985, the government adopted a paternalistic
approach to poverty reduction b y promoting full employment, providing generous wages in the public and
parastatal sectors, and establishing an elaborate social security system. This approach brought benefits to
the urban elite, which were further shared through family networks, and helped to trigger a massive rural
exodus.

-51-

This approach was successful in reducing the incidence of extreme poverty in the country, but did
little to reduce relative poverty. Furthermore, i t encouraged the growth of a dual economy, in which rural
areas were marginalized and the output of tradable goods, particularly agriculture, decreased (the “Dutch
syndrome”). The government invested heavily in capital projects and industries, assuming substantial
debt in the process. Despite high education and health expenditures, the regressive design and inefficient
management o f these services made little impact on social indicators, making them comparable to those
for poorer IDA-eligible African countries.
The World Bank was involved with Gabon in the early years of independence through projects in
roads, education, urban water supply, and manganese mining. During the o i l boom, however, Gabon did
not see a need for IBRD borrowing. After the o i l crisis in 1986, the Bank again supported Gabon through
a Structural Adjustment Loan, a Technical Assistance Project aimed at improving macroeconomic
management, and a Road Maintenance Project. However, due to deteriorating terms of trade for i t s
principal exports and overvaluation of the CFA franc, Gabon’s economic performance continued to
weaken. The devaluation of 1993, accompanied b y an Economic Recovery Loan and an IMF Stand-by
arrangement, enabled Gabon to restore macro-economic stability. Gabon took the lead among Central
African countries in revising trade and investment incentives, reducing or eliminating barriers to trade and
special privileges. In 1995 Gabon embarked on a more ambitious reform program supported by a threeyear extended arrangement with the IMF. Though this program encountered internal and external
difficulties in execution, i t demonstrated the commitment of the authorities to improved macroeconomic
management and restored growth.
Gabon’s first CAS was prepared in 1994 and accompanied the Economic Recovery Loan (ERL).
A prior operation, the Forestry and Environment Project (FY 93), supported institutional reform and
capacity building in the forestry sector. The CAS also envisaged for FY 94 and FY 95 a quick-disbursing
Public Sector Restructuring Loan, a Transport and Urban Infrastructure Technical Assistance Project, and
an Agriculture Services Project. For the outer years of FY 96 and FY 97, i t anticipated lending support
for human resource development, a policy-based operation in the transport sector, and investment
operations in transport and urban development. The ERL closed on time with satisfactory ratings. The
TransportAJrban TA Loan was approved as foreseen in FY 95, and was s t i l l under implementation at the
time o f the 1998 CAS. Progress on privatization was slower than expected, and the Privatization and
Regulatory Capacity Building Project was only approved in FY 97. An Urban LIL, based on a successful
pilot under the TransportAJrban TA Project, was approved in early FY 99. In addition, a Regional
Environmental Information Management Project funded by GEF and based in Gabon was approved in FY
97. In other sectors, the anticipated operations did not materialize.
In 1995, the World Bank carried out a Poverty Assessment (PA) in Gabon. I t analyzed data from
the 1993 General Population Census and the 1994 Household Expenditure Survey (the latter limited to
about 400 households in Libreville and Port Gentil), as well as from participatory discussions with poor
people in Libreville and some towns o f the interior. An urban absolute poverty line was established,
based on the HES results, at about U S $700 per capita income or approximately twice the rural absolute
poverty line of a dollar a day (US $365 per capita). The relative poverty line was set at the legal
minimum wage, corresponding to a per capita income of about U S $1,450. Using these definitions, the
study showed that while absolute poverty had dropped from 66% to 23% between 1960 and 1994, relative
poverty had declined only slightly, from 87% in 1960 to 83% in 1994. There were dramatic differences
in standards of living between the elite minority and the vast majority of the population, including many
public employees who had to make their incomes stretch to meet the needs of large extended families.
There were also important rural-urban and inter-provincial disparities in poverty and social indicators.

The report proposed the broad outlines o f a poverty reduction strategy for Gabon. The priority
goals proposed for such a strategy were: (a) reducing unemployment, (b) raising incomes for small

-52-

farmers, (c) improving basic public health, (d) rehabilitating the urban environment, (e) reforming social
protection policies, and (f) establishing a reliable statistics system. The Bank study identified several
preconditions for the success of such a program: disengaging the state from industrial and commercial
activities and redirecting the resources saved to programs directly benefiting the poor; creating an
enabling environment for private sector development that would promote the growth of labor-intensive
rather than capital-intensive activities; and improving the transparency and efficiency of budget
management b y promoting community involvement in service provision and facilitating the emergence o f
NGOs.
The Poverty Assessment was carried out under the guidance of an Inter Ministerial Technical
Committee chaired by the Ministry of Planning, and in collaboration with other donors, notably UNDP
and France. The PA and proposed strategy were discussed and disseminated at a national seminar in 1997,
and i t s recommendations were formally adopted. Nevertheless i t remained an externally driven study,
with little real ownership from Government for the poverty alleviation agenda.
Dialogue between the Bank, the IMF, and the Government of Gabon was made more difficult by
the lack o f local representation. In 1996 the Bank opened a small office in Libreville and assigned a
Resident Economist to improve contact and communications with the country. In 1997/98, with
Presidential elections approaching, the Resident Economist led the team that prepared the 1998 CAS, in
consultation with other donors and with reform-minded members of the Government.

A.

Long Term Strategic Goals

The Government’s long term strategy, as described in the CAS, was to reduce i t s dependency on
o i l revenues and foster private sector-led growth in other areas.’ This strategy had three pillars: (a)
maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, (b) providing an enabling environment for private sector
development, and (c) developing policies to diversify the economy. Under macroeconomic stability, the
Government’s stated goals were to broaden the tax base, reduce the tendency to respond “pro-cyclically’’
(that is, b y increasing public expenditures and employment rather than decreasing them) to external
shocks, and complete the ongoing program o f trade liberalization. The program for private sector
development included increasing the pace of privatization, improving the legal and regulatory
environment, implementing a National Employment Plan, and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks, in
particular, adopting a strategy to guide urban development. Action to diversify the economy would be
based on a rural development strategy that would address the potential for smallholder development o f
perennial crops in connection with the privatization o f Gabon’s major agro-enterprises, promoting the
wood transformation industry, and exploring the potential for further development of fishing and tourism,
as well as support services for extractive industries. Poverty alleviation and the other Multilateral
Development Goals (not yet articulated in 1998) did not appear among the Government’s long term
objectives.
The CAS states that the Gabonese authorities wished Bank support in preparing a medium-term
development strategy that would be based not only on the goals outlined in Gabon 2025, but also on the
poverty reduction strategy proposed b y the Bank and adopted by Government in 1997. Based on the
assumption that the Government agreed with and accepted the Bank’s analysis, the CAS described the
second and third objectives o f the Government’s development agenda as “addressing deficiencies in
human development” and “reinforcing the capacities o f c i v i l society.” To implement the second
objective, i t would be necessary to improve the delivery and management o f public goods and services,
including health and education, social protection, environmental management, and poverty monitoring.
1

The documentary basis for this strategy i s not clear. The CAS cites Gabon 2025, a long-term vision study prepared
with UNDP financing.

-53-

In addition, the management of public finances would need to be improved, and civil service reform

would be needed to build the capacity to implement poverty-oriented reforms. The third objective,
reinforcing the capacity of civil society, was seen as a key element in improving governance and the
sustainability of economic reforms.

During the CAS period and beyond, the Government made limited progress towards achieving i t s
long-term goals. Economic growth stagnated, although non-oil revenues increased slightly replacing
somewhat the declining o i l revenues. The tax base was broadened marginally and the program of trade
liberalization was largely completed. However, the Government did not succeed in adopting
countercyclical expenditure policies, nor did i t succeed in convincing lenders to restructure or reduce i t s
external debt. Progress on privatization was slow and uneven, despite strong support from the Bank and
the IMF. Various reforms designed to improve the legal and regulatory environment for the private sector
have been prepared, and some have been adopted. However, they are yet to become effective due to
capacity constraints as well as resistance from vested interests. An autonomous Road Fund was
established to manage and maintain the nation’s road network, and concessions were awarded to the
private sector for the management of key ports. Major difficulties were encountered in an attempt to
privatize the operations of the railway, and pre-privatization restructuring has only just started for Air
Gabon. An urban development strategy was adopted in 2000, but i t has not yet been implemented. As a
result, relatively little progress has been made on diversification of the economy.
During this same period, a dialogue was initiated and maintained between the Bank, supported b y
the IMF, IFC, and other donors, and the Government, through which some progress has been made
towards developing a commitment to poverty alleviation and good governance as proper roles for the
State. This process culminated in the preparation of an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted
by Government in late 2003.

The poverty alleviation agenda as outlined in the CAS was clearly too ambitious given the limited
Bank resources that could be devoted to supporting t h i s effort. Although current data are largely
unavailable and existing data are unreliable, social indicators seem to have worsened, if anything, over the
CAS period. Members of the Government o f Gabon were consulted during the preparation of the CAS,
but the Government never formally agreed to accept i t as their own.

B.

CAS Objectives

Based on previous experience, the CAS team concluded that policy dialogue, ESW, technical
assistance, and an active presence in Gabon had been more effective instruments o f assistance than
project lending. Thus, the CAS recommended that the Bank’s assistance should be aimed at catalyzing
domestic and international partners to help the Government address poverty. The objectives of the CAS
were stated as:
0
0

0
0

Support reforms in public finance management with a focus on poverty alleviation sectors,
Help establish or reorient sector strategies in key areas where they would have a direct impact
on poverty,
Foster transparency and improved governance, and
Support the privatization process while leveraging other donor resources in support of private
sector development.

The CAS envisaged two assistance scenarios for the period 1999-2001. Under the Base Case,
macro-economic stability would be maintained as evidenced by compliance with an IMF program; the
Government would make satisfactory progress in formulating a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework

-54-

for health, education, and rural development; progress on privatization would continue; and the Bank
portfolio would remain in satisfactory status. Given t h i s scenario, the Bank envisaged two new lending
operations, a Public Sector Reform TA Loan and a Railway Rehabilitation Project, as well as substantial
non-lending support to improve budget management and the effectiveness of social sector expenditures.
The L o w Case would be triggered by a lack of compliance with any of the above criteria, and would
involve no new lending operations and a more limited provision of non-lending services.
Specific actions and progress indicators were set out in an annex table, organized around the three
fostering non-oil private sector led growth, (ii)
strengthening public sector effectiveness and
pillars of (i)
building civil society capacity (see Annex A to this report). The matrix showed
efficiency, and (iii)
proposed outcomes and progress indicators for the Government of Gabon as well as for the Bank
program. In fact, the achievement of the Bank program depended heavily on the Government’s doing i t s
part; the Bank program was mainly to provide technical advice and to comment on Government
proposals. The matrix shows that the strategy relied heavily on policy advice to accomplish the
objectives, and also on the cooperation of other development partners. A summary table on the following
page shows the CAS objectives and the instruments that were expected to help achieve those objectives.
Although little new lending was proposed, the strategy relied on sector dialogue that was ongoing under
existing projects ( T r a n s p o f l r b a n TA, Forestry and Environment, and Privatization TA) and the
demonstration effects expected from the recently approved Urban LIL. In addition, an IDF grant had
recently been approved to help the Government increase capacity in the civil service.
The lending and non-lending programs foreseen in the CAS and actual results are shown in
Annexes 2 and 3. The CAS promised that key parameters, including shifts in the numbers of people
below the poverty line, increases in educational attainment, life expectancy, and changes in infant
mortality and AIDS morbidity would be monitored in collaboration with Gabonese authorities, while
semi-annual joint IMF/Bank missions would monitor macroeconomic performance. In summary, the
CAS called for the Bank to play the role of “Knowledge Bank” for Gabon rather than that o f a traditional
lender.

Implementation. Gabon has wavered in and out of the Base Case since 1998. Compliance with
IMF programs has been uneven; substantial slippage occurred in the implementation of the 1995-97
Extended Fund Facility and the 18-month Standby Arrangement approved in 2000. Problems in
macroeconomic management were experienced in 1998 when o i l revenues exceeded expectations, and
again in 2002/3 in connection with municipal and parliamentary elections. However, in each case the
authorities took steps to put the country back on track. The Bank and the IMF have worked closely
together to carry out the macroeconomic dialogue and to support the development of domestic budget
management capacity. Progress on privatization has continued, albeit slowly, and the Bank small
portfolio has generally remained in satisfactory status. However, counterpart funding o f ongoing projects
has been slow to materialize, and disbursements have been slow, necessitating the repeated extension o f
existing projects in order to accomplish their objectives. The Government, with the support of UNDP,
has taken initial steps towards preparing a poverty reduction strategy, but has not yet reached the point of
formulating a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for health, education, and rural development.

T o assist the Government in preparing the proposed Public Sector Reform TA Loan, the Bank
secured a PHRD grant of $750,000 to Gabon in August 1999. A unit was set up within the Planning
Ministry to coordinate project preparation. The grant was to be used (1) to help finance the development
of social sector strategies, (2) to support an expenditure programming and debt management workshop
and a pilot debt swap, and (3) to develop poverty indicators and projections as a baseline for the future
PRSP. The grant was administered b y the Bank and financed the contributions of several international
consultants. However, the Government did not consider that the work of these consultants responded to
their priority needs. In response, the Bank agreed to reorient the agenda more towards macroeconomic
management than poverty alleviation. Ultimately, however, the Government informed the Bank that i t
did not intend to follow through with a request for a Public Sector Reform TA Loan. The Bank then
offered to help prepare and supervise the project (which the Government said i t would finance with
domestic resources), if the Government would reimburse the Bank’s costs. The Government refused t h i s
offer, and the Bank closed the PHRD grant on June 30,2001. The Public Sector Reform TA Loan did not
materialize.*
Policy dialogue continued through ongoing consultations with the BanMIMF team and through
the implementation of ongoing projects. The T r a n s p o f l r b a n TA Project was closed in March 2000,
four years after the original closing date, with a satisfactory rating. The project supported the
development of transport and urban sector strategies and led to a Transport Sector Donor Roundtable in
July 1998 which was expected to serve as a model for similar roundtables in other sectors to be carried
out under the 1998 CAS. The project also carried out a pilot program of community-based, laborintensive urban infrastructure improvement in the AvCa neighborhood of Libreville. T h i s program
became the basis for the Pilot Community Infrastructure Works and Capacity Building Project (Urban
LIL) approved in August 1998.
The ForestryEnvironment Project, started in FY 93, closed on June 30, 2002, four years after i t s
original closing date. I t s outcome was rated satisfactory3 but i t s sustainability unlikely unless followed up
b y a second project. The project aimed to restructure and strengthen the Ministry of Water and Forestry
and the Ministry of Environment, Tourism, and National Parks, as part o f the Government’s overall effort
to diversify sources of revenue away from oil. I t also included research, training, and pilot activities in
sustainable forest management. I t supported the development o f a revised Forestry Code, which was
adopted in 2001, and a reform o f forestry taxation, reflected in the Budget Laws of 2002 and 2003. I t
prepared a number of further proposals for administrative reform and capacity building whose
2

Earlier, Gabon received a similar grant to prepare an Agricultural Extension Project, which was fully disbursed, but the
froject was dropped.
This rating was revised to “Moderately Satisfactory,” an option not available to ICR authors, by OED reviewers.

implementation would be supported b y the Forestryhvironment Sector Program currently in
preparation.
The Privatization TA project, approved in FY 97, carried much of the burden of implementing the
1998 CAS goals related to private sector development. I t was moderately successful in doing so,
although progress was slower than anticipated. The project has funded studies and direct technical
assistance to the Government, not only in the field of privatization, but also in broader capacity building
activities related t o the creation of an enabling environment, including a legal framework, for private
sector development. Goals that were established for FY 01 are nearing accomplishment towards the end
o f FY 04. Originally scheduled to close in June 2001, the project was extended three times and closed in
June 2004.
The Urban LIL, approved just prior to the 1998 CAS, has made a substantial contribution with a
strong demonstration effect in mobilizing urban neighborhoods to improve their living conditions and in
strengthening the capacity of small contractors. Expected to close in December 2001, the project was
extended twice and closed in June 2004. I t has successfully modeled a participatory approach to smallscale infrastructure planning with the involvement of local (chefs de quartier) and municipal authorities.
I t has succeeded in generating employment in the urban neighborhoods selected for the project and in
stimulating the growth of small enterprises. Recently, the project unit (formerly the unit in charge of the
T r a n s p o f l r b a n TA Project) has conducted a review of planned public expenditures in the health and
education sectors to identify additional infrastructure projects that could be carried out using a similar
approach, thus providing sustainability to the project. I t i s believed that a new lending operation w i l l be
needed to sustain Government commitment and scale up the program to meet the needs of Gabon’s urban
population.
Dialogue in the transport sector has continued with the aim of preparing the ground for the
proposed Railway Rehabilitation Project or a similar operation. However, the process of concessioning
the railways encountered numerous difficulties. Other problems cropped up in the management o f the
public expenditure program in transport, which has not always been consistent with the transport sector
strategy adopted under the Transport/Urban TA Project. In short, the policy environment never reached
the point where an investment in railway rehabilitation could be justified, and the project was finally
dropped from the lending program. Thus, there has been no new lending to Gabon since the 1998 CAS
was approved.
Non-lending support has been provided through continuing policy dialogue involving the IMF
and the World Bank, as well as a joint Financial Sector Assessment carried out in FY 03. The Bank also
assisted the Government in developing a new Procurement Code, adopted in FY 03. The planned Rural
Development Strategy was never budgeted by the Bank, as the Government expressed no interest in it.
Internal Bank resources were allocated for a Country Economic Memorandum, but no memorandum has
yet been produced. The position of Resident Economist was upgraded to Resident Representative in
1999, and staff and logistical support were added to the Country Office. However, the new Resident
Representative did not succeed in establishing a constructive dialogue with Government. H e returned to
Washington in 2001, and the post remained vacant until January 2003, when the current Resident
Representative arrived in Gabon.
Generally, the ongoing projects have remained in satisfactory status. Overall some policy
dialogue has been carried out, and certain policy changes have been accomplished. Some projects had a
slow start because of the unfamiliarity of project staff with Bank procedures after a long period when the
Bank had not been involved in that sector. Timely counterpart funding has always been a problem, and

-58-

the need for close control of procurement activities has also slowed disbursement^.^ As a result, all the
ongoing projects have been extended to the limit, typically taking three more years to complete than
originally planned.
The CAS identified three short-term risks to the Bank’s strategy: (1) delays following the
forthcoming presidential elections; (2) regional instability due to civil unrest in neighboring countries,
further declines in oil and commodity prices. Over the longer term, major risks related to
and (iii)
progress (or lack thereof) on governance and institutional capacity issues. The short-term risks did not
materialize. Presidential elections took place as scheduled and did not cause major delays, although they
may have been related to some slippage in the implementation of the IMF program. Unrest did occur in
neighboring countries, particularly Congo and CAR, but this has not resulted in significant spillovers,
either of conflict or of refugees, into Gabon. O i l and commodity prices have fluctuated but have not
declined enough to jeopardize the implementation of the Government’s expenditure programs. I t was
slow progress on governance and institutional capacity building that impeded the implementation o f
ongoing projects and the development of new lending.
The CAS did not foresee the risk of the Government’s taking advantage o f Bank technical
assistance and grant support without following up by borrowing. I t was correct in identifying the longerterm risks, but failed to recognize that these same risks could have significant short-term effects that
would impede the realization of CAS objectives.
Fostering non-oil private sector-led growth. Performance in this area was mixed. Many of the
specific actions identified in the CAS as performance indicators have in fact been carried out (although
many would not have been done b y the end o f the official CAS period in October 2001). With respect to
the maintenance of macro-economic stability, the Government has performed reasonably well on the
revenue side, but has not succeeded in controlling expenditures or in significantly reducing external debt.
Some capacity building has taken place, but more i s probably needed; more important i s the fact that
technically competent civil servants are unable to impose financial discipline on political decisionmakers. On trade promotion, the necessary actions have largely been taken. The privatization program
has continued with moderate success, although substantial resistance has been encountered with respect to
transport, telecommunications and postal services. One goal that seems unlikely to be met before the end
o f 2004 i s the creation of a mutual fund for the placement of Government-owned minority shares with the
public.

With regard to the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for private sector development,
the results are also mixed. New Mining and Forestry Codes (but no Petroleum Code) have been adopted,
and revisions to the Law on Competition, the Labor Code, and the Social Security Code have been
studied and discussed, though not yet adopted. Studies are s t i l l underway for the restructuring o f the
National Social Security Fund. Price controls have been largely eliminated, but remain on items o f
“primary ne~essity.”~The Department of Price Controls has been legally renamed as the Department o f
Competition, but i t s administrative culture remains unchanged and the public i s unclear about i t s new
responsibilities. Some training has been provided to the judiciary, and the Journal oficiel has been
published regularly. New institutions have been established to regulate and promote the private sector,
but their capacity requires considerable strengthening in order for them to be effective. N o regulatory
agency has yet been established for the recently privatized water and electricity services.
4

In the case of the ForestryEhvironment Project, the 1993 devaluation also doubled the funds available (and the
requirements for local counterpart contributions), which contributed to delays i n implementation.
5
The continuation of price controls on primary commodities (including pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, bread,
sugar, school materials and supplies) i s part of a recently negotiatedagreement between Government, industry, and labor,
whereby labor has promisedto refrain from strikes for a period of three years, and Government will pay i t s debts to the private
sector.

-59-

The situation of the financial sector i s relatively satisfactory, although banks remain exposed to
risk from loans t o public enterprises and government suppliers, as well as from the narrow (nondiversified) base of private investment. Access to micro-credit has very recently improved, with support
from AfDB and bilateral donors. However, the situation with respect to credit for small and medium
enterprises and industries i s s t i l l not very satisfactory. Large numbers o f loans outstanding and new
requirements for group guarantees limit the capacity of banking institutions to respond to the needs o f t h i s
sub-sector. Little progress has been made with respect to adapting the labor force to meet market needs.
In the transport sector, the reform agenda set forth in the transport sector strategy has been only partly
implemented. As a result, transport costs related to international trade have not declined significantly.
Strengthening public sector effectiveness and efficiency. Performance in t h i s area has been
disappointing. With respect to administrative reform, the program i s proceeding slowly. This i s partly
due to a recognition that changes in administrative structure should follow, rather than precede, the
elaboration o f sector strategies in the context of a national development strategy based on poverty
reduction as well as economic growth. The CAS assumed that sector strategies would be prepared shortly
after the PA workshop, and that administrative reforms would follow in due course. In fact, the
preparation of sector strategies related to poverty reduction has been slowed by data difficulties, partly
reflecting a lack o f political will, and has not been followed closely by the Bank.

Relatively little has been accomplished in terms of improving the management of public finances.
Some studies which were to have been financed under the PHRD grant, concerning development of a debt
management strategy and promotion of the country’s competitiveness, did not take place because the
grant was cancelled. Lacking sectoral strategies, the Government was unable to develop a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. A budgetary information system has been put in place with support from the
Bank and IMF. However, i t i s s t i l l too soon to say if this system w i l l effectively improve expenditure
control. A poverty monitoring system has not been put in place, although funds from the PHRD grant
were used to support a Demographic and Health Survey carried out in 2000 which could provide some
data elements for such a system. The Africa Capacity Building Foundation has carried out some training
for parliamentarians, but t h i s support has not enabled Parliament to exercise real budgetary oversight so
far.
In the health and education sectors, progress was also limited by the lack of action on sector
strategies. Under the PHRD grant, support was provided for the preparation o f a carte scolaire and a
carte sanitaire, as well as for a study on education unit costs. The unit cost study was completed, but the
two cartes are s t i l l in preparation. When the Bank was no longer actively involved, other U.N. agencies
stepped in to help the Government work on these sector strategies. Unfortunately, severe data
deficiencies have greatly constrained the effectiveness of their support. Meanwhile, social indicators
appear to have worsened over the CAS period.6 With respect to social protection, the only progress made
was the reassignment of financial responsibility for three hospitals from the National Social Security
Fund to the Ministry of Health. The continued viability of Gabon’s social protection system i s now
seriously in question, with declining revenues and rising rates of unemployment. On environmental
protection, despite an ambitious CAS agenda, little has been done either b y the Bank or b y Government,
except in the context of the ForestryEnvironment Project.’

Data on these indicators shown in Annex A are drawn from the Government’s Tableau de Bord Social, no. 2
(September 2003), covering 1996-1999.
7
However, the recent creation by the Government of thirteen new National Parks and proposals to set up an autonomous
agency for park management should be commended here.

-60-

The Bank did not follow through on i t s promise to conduct an Information Assessment for
Gabon. In addition to the Demographic and Health Survey mentioned above, the Government conducted
i t s decennial census in 2003; however, this did not include household budget information, and the results
w i l l not be available for some time. A recent Bank mission in the context of the PRSP assisted the
Government in defining a survey which could be carried out quickly and could provide the basic data on
which a poverty monitoring strategy could be built. The Bank i s now helping the Government seek grant
funds to carry out such a survey, in order to prepare a satisfactory PRSP before the end of calendar 2004.
However, the broader agenda o f promoting transparency and public involvement through dissemination
o f government information has hardly been addressed, as shown by the consultations undertaken incountry for this report.
Building civil society capacity. The CAS agenda in this area was not very explicit, and i t
depended to a great extent on the activities of other partners. Two clearly stated objectives, the adoption
o f a Family Code and the adoption of a National I E C Strategy, were not accomplished. The Bank did not
provide any practical support for these objectives. Little was done to build the capacity of domestic
NGOs, either b y the Bank or b y other donors.’ The program o f the Africa Capacity Building Foundation
did not extend to NGOs. The Bank team did not take action, as promised, to involve ED1 (WBI) in t h i s
area. Without any particular help from the Bank, the Government succeeded in maintaining civil peace
and providing leadership for the resolution of regional conflicts.
Exogenous factors. The implementation of the Government’s program has been perturbed from
time to time by fluctuations in o i l revenue and b y civil conflict in neighboring countries. However, these
events were not o f sufficient magnitude to be considered major external shocks. The Government has
remained remarkably stable over the period (and indeed, over the last forty years). It has become
increasingly aware of the burden of external debt and the limitations that this imposes on i t s ability to
alleviate poverty, especially in the context of declining o i l revenues and the inherent weaknesses o f the
rent redistribution system. The Government, with the support of U N D P has prepared an Interim PRSP
and i s currently working on a full PRSP with assistance from the Bank.
Unintended impacts. Because of the relatively light “footprint” o f the Bank’s program in Gabon,
there have not been any unintended negative consequences, social or environmental, during the period
covered by the CAS. The ForestrylEnvironment Project made a small contribution to improving the
management o f existing protected areas, complemented by the activities o f other donors. Implementation
o f sustainable forest management practices through application of the revised Forestry Code may be o f
greater significance to Gabon’s future. The failure to develop a Petroleum Code means that an
opportunity to address the environmental aspects of this key sector has been missed. The TransporWrban
TA project was expected to support preparation of environmental assessment guidelines for the transport
and urban sectors, but these were given a lower priority than other planned outputs and were not
accomplished under the project.

On the social side, there i s considerable public concern about the privatization program going
ahead in the absence of funding for social plans for affected employees. In fact, this has not happened,
but i t i s one of the reasons for delayed implementation of the privatization program. Originally the social
plans were to have been funded by an AfDB loan. For a while, this funding was interrupted due to nonpayment o f Gabon’s arrears to AfDB, and consequently some privatization activities could not be
completed according to schedule. This problem has now been resolved and AfDB funding has been
resumed; while the Bank‘s project w i l l come to an end in June 2004. In contrast, the community

mobilization activities pioneered b y the Urban LIL has empowered some of the relatively poor to take
responsibility for meeting their own infrastructure needs.

C.

Measuring Bank Performance

Quality of products and services.
Generally, where the Bank managed to be present, i t s
contributions in the areas of both lending and non-lending are regarded as having been of high quality.
The Urban LIL has received numerous commendations for excellence. The two projects closed during
the CAS period (Transpodurban TA and ForestryEnvironment) have been rated as satisfactory, though
sustainability i s believed to depend on follow-on lending operations. The Bank has worked closely with
the IMF and also with IFC and MIGA to assist the Government in achieving i t s objectives o f
diversification away from oil and promoting growth through private sector development.

There have been three Q A G reviews of operations in Gabon during the CAS period: a Quality at
Entry review of the Urban LIL in 1998, a Quality of Supervision assessment of the same project in 2002,
and Quality o f Supervision o f Risky Projects review o f the ForestryEnvironment Project in 2000
(previously reviewed b y Q A G in 1997). The Urban LIL was rated Highly Satisfactory at entry and
Satisfactory in supervision. The ForestryEnvironment Project was rated Marginally Satisfactory in light
of the Government’s lack o f early commitment and substantially delayed implementation.
The CAS outlined an ambitious agenda which was supported b y a small, though well-placed,
cadre of reform-minded members of the Gabon Government. I t did not have broad based ownership at
the time, particularly with respect to the objectives of promoting greater transparency in government and
a stronger focus on poverty alleviation in public expenditure management. While the Government agreed
in principle, i t was unwilling to borrow (on IBRD terms) for the implementation of such activities. There
was also likely to be strong resistance on the part of vested interests in the different sectors, as illustrated
b y the experience of ongoing projects in transport and forestry as well as b y the privatization program.
During the CAS period, the Bank wisely refrained from pushing the Government to prepare new lending
operations, instead devoting i t s limited budget to policy dialogue and supervision o f ongoing operations.
Over time, through extended dialogue with the Bank and IMF and other members of the donor
community, and with grant support extended by other bilateral or multilateral donors, the Government has
gained greater understanding of the need for improving transparency, as part of i t s efforts to promote
private investment, and for addressing relative poverty.
From the Bank’s point of view the need to limit intervention to those sectors in which Gabon i s
willing to accept help from the Bank means that in practice Bank support i s concentrated in the
infrastructure and PSD sectors, while education, health, and rural development (except for forestry) go
unsupported b y the Bank. Continuing poor performance by Gabon on the development indicators used to
program Bank budgets l i m i t s the resources available to provide “free” technical assistance. A large share
of these resources i s consumed b y joint s t a f f work with the IMF and b y the costs o f maintaining a fully
equipped Country Office. Limited resources also have a demoralizing effect on the Bank country team.
Lack of opportunity to work on Gabon means that the country gets a l o w priority from sector managers
and high turnover among technical staff. Gabon has had six different Country Economists over the past
six years, and for two years was without a Country Economist all together.
In-country consultations on the results o f the CAS reveal that i t s structure and contents were
virtually unknown outside the Ministry of Planning, and even by some mid-level officials within the
Ministry. Although the CAS was translated into French, no copy in French could be found anywhere in
Government, in the Resident Mission files, or in Washington. The English copy in the Ministry of Plan
files did not include Annex B9, the performance matrix. Given this lack o f information, most
interlocutors refused to comment directly on the results o f the CAS. Their comments revealed a mistaken
belief that the Bank (in collaboration with the IMF and the international community) i s only concerned

-62-

about opening Gabon markets to international trade and cares little about the consequences in Gabon.
They thought the Bank had abandoned the poverty agenda. They see little benefit to Gabon from
privatization, and fear the consequences in terms of unemployment and social unrest. A common theme
was resentment about not being considered eligible for IDA funding (including for HIV/AIDS) or for the
HIPC Initiative.
The Bank did not meet the lending targets established in the CAS, as they were not consistent
with the real intentions o f the Government (Annex B). Country dialogue and coordination with other
donors has continued, when a bank representative was present in the country, in an effort to prepare the
ground for future lending operations that may be more likely to prove sustainable. In the meantime, the
successful execution of ongoing operations has developed support for their continuation, and created
domestic capacity to prepare and carry out new operations in these sectors.
The 1998 CAS did not present clear targets and dates for non-lending deliverables (see Annex C).
The promised Rural Sector Strategy and Information Management Assessment were not delivered. A
Country Economic Memorandum was not promised, but was budgeted, although not delivered as a
document. On the other hand considerable unplanned non-lending support has been provided in response
to requests from the Government and other development partners (notably the IMF). The subjects of this
support (financial sector assessment, review of the procurement code , budget management information
system, poverty monitoring) were consistent with CAS objectives, although they are different from what
was foreseen in the CAS. They reflect a growing emphasis on governance issues, with a corresponding
decreased emphasis on poverty issues.
Portfolio assessment. With four projects in the portfolio in 1999, and only two after 2001,
portfolio indicators based on averages could be misleading. Disbursement ratios reached a high of 48.2 in
2001 when the ForestryEnvironment Project came to a close, dropped to 28.9 in the next year and rose to
35.5 in 2004. Both ongoing projects (Privatization TA and Urban LIL) were rated as projects at risk and
problem projects in 2003, but these problems were resolved and the risk rating removed by 2004.
Typically, projects have taken longer than expected to be implemented, with a current average o f 6.2
years. Three completed projects have been evaluated b y OED in the last five years (Transpodurban TA,
ForestryEnvironment, and the Regional Environmental Information Management) and have been rated
Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory.

Country dialogue. The 1998 CAS was developed with the support of a Country Director who
placed a priority on Gabon as a potential economic leader and guarantor of social peace in the Central
African sub-region. As one tangible indicator of t h i s priority, the position of Resident Economist was
upgraded to that o f a Resident Representative, and the Bank officially opened a Country Office in Gabon.
The new Resident Representative was faced with the task of implementing a CAS that did not enjoy
widespread Government ownership. At the same time, the Country Director left the position and a year
later left the Bank and was replaced by a Director who did not share h i s views. Misunderstandings arose
between the Bank and the Government concerning the extent and nature of planned Bank support. To
complicate matters, both the Bank and the Government were sending mixed messages through the variety
of interlocutors involved in the dialogue. The Resident Representative was unable to manage t h i s process
and had no control over the allocation o f the country budget. There was only partial commitment on the
part of the Country Team, since the administrative budget was unable to cover all their costs. The
Resident Representative returned to Washington in 2001 and the position remained vacant until a new
Resident Representative took up the assignment in January 2003.
Under the circumstances, i t i s remarkable that policy dialogue has continued as well as i t has.
This seems to be mainly due to continued close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF, even though
-63-

there has been l i t t l e continuity in the Country Economist position. The Bank has continued to provide
direct support to help the Government meet IMF conditions, through such activities as preparation of a
Procurement Code and a Financial Sector Assessment. The Bank‘s Foreign Investment Advisory Service
(FIAS) i s preparing a diagnostic review as part of a program to help improve the investment climate for
the private sector. The Bank has backed away from the poverty alleviation agenda, recognizing that the
Government would not be ready to receive Bank support in this area for a long time. Consequently, much
of the necessary preparation work has been left to other donors. However, now that Gabon has adopted
an I-PRSP, the Bank has begun to provide support for the preparation o f a full PRSP which w i l l be
actionable and acceptable to the donor community.

D.

Consultation and Coordination with Development Partners

Coordinated action with other development partners was absolutely essential to achieving the
CAS goals. Considering that Gabon’s requirements for international assistance are relatively limited, a
remarkable number of donors are present in the country, including several U.N. agencies. France, the
European Union, and Canada are key bilateral partners. The African Development Bank (AfDB) i s also
active in Gabon. Indeed, the implementation of some privatization activities were delayed when the
AfDB, which had approved lending in support of training and “social reinsertion” of retrenched workers,
suspended disbursements to Gabon due to accumulated arrears. The problem was resolved and AfDB
lending to Gabon resumed only in 2003.
U N D P has assisted the Government in preparing i t s National Environmental Action Plan, and,
more recently, i t s Interim PRSP. I t has also assisted in strengthening economic management capacity b y
conducting seminars and workshops in technical ministries. W H O provided support for the development
of a health sector strategy and action plan. UNESCO has carried out some studies in support of a future
education sector strategy. The U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) planned to provide support
for the development o f a national IEC strategy and for N G O capacity building. However, these activities
did not materialize. The ILO has been involved in revising the Labor Code but i t has not been able to
participate in planning educational reforms to produce a labor force better adapted to meet the needs of
private investors.
During the CAS period, Gabon agreed to “host” the Regional Environmental Information
Management Project (REIMP) supported b y GEF. The Government of Gabon was the official grant
recipient, but the funds were immediately forwarded to an international N G O (ADIE) established under
Gabon law, but independent o f the Government, to execute the project. The REIMP collaborated closely
with the ForestEnvironment Project in i t s later stages, and this collaboration i s likely to spill over into a
GEF grant for Gabon associated with the future ForestEnvironment Sector Program. An anticipated
collaboration with WWF to execute a debt-for-nature swap did not materialize, due to the unwillingness
of Government to use PHRD funds to support the necessary studies, and the inability o f the Bank to
supply the services of an expert.

Gabon also plays a leading role in the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC),
and in t h i s context i s a linchpin for the Bank’s strategy to promote regional integration in Central Africa.
This strategy w i l l provide technical assistance to the C E M A C countries for trade facilitation, customs
reform, banking sector monitoring and market development, microfinance, road infrastructure, air safety,
and institutional strengthening. Consultations in Gabon showed that stakeholders are expecting that
Gabon w i l l benefit from Bank financial participation in regional road infrastructure improvements and in
microfinance initiatives. I t i s to be hoped that these expectations w i l l not be disappointed due to the fact
that Gabon i s required to borrow on IBRD terms.

-64-

Some initiatives that were expected to be undertaken together with partners did not materialize,
due to changes in Bank and Government priorities. For example, the Bank did not pursue the preparation
o f a Rural Development Strategy for Gabon, with which France was willing to assist. Similarly, U N D P
and Canada were prepared to support efforts to improve access to micro-credit and credit for small and
medium enterprises, in tandem with Bank efforts to develop a local market for government shares in
former public enterprises. As this agenda has not progressed very far, the framework for such
collaboration has not yet been established. France and the European Investment Bank had expressed
interest in cofinancing the Railway Rehabilitation operation. It i s now proceeding with their funding but
without Bank participation. Several bilateral donors have expressed willingness to support future
operations in the social sectors, once the Bank has determined that sound and sustainable sector strategies
are in place.
Gabon has played a leading role in the implementation of the Africa Capacity Building
Foundation (ACBF), and A C B F was expected to contribute significantly to institutional strengthening in
Gabon during the CAS period. A project for capacity building in economic and financial management
(PRECAGEF) was put in place but performed poorly under i t s first project manager. Information about
opportunities provided b y the project was not widely disseminated, and programs were not well designed
to meet real needs for s k i l l development. This project i s currently being restructured. The CAS also
promised that the country team would solicit ED1 support for a parliamentary capacity building program
in Gabon. Apparently this did not take place. IFC holds significant investments in Gabon in the o i l and
mining sectors, and provided technical support during the privatization of electricity and water services.
During the CAS period, IFC made a $18 million investment in the operations of V A A L C O Gabon, a
subsidiary o f V A A L C O Energy, Inc., responsible for developing the Etame Marine offshore oilfield.
During CAS preparation, a participatory process was followed which i s described in Annex D of
the CAS. I t portrays the CAS as a direct outcome of the Poverty Assessment participatory process, as
well as participatory strategic planning undertaken under the Transport/Urban TA project. I t also refers to
a Public Expenditure Review undertaken b y the Resident Economist which helped focus the policy
dialogue in the education, health, and social protection ~ e c t o r s . ~The CAS mission itself had limited
opportunity to consult with c i v i l society, although i t did meet with central government officials, the donor
community, and representatives of Parliament. These discussions provided a forum for airing grievances
on both sides, but did not result in a recognition o f fundamental differences that would later impede the
implementation of the CAS. The Country Office sought a broader distribution o f the CAS document once
i t was made final, but this did not take place.

The Government broadly agreed with the Bank and the donor community about the need to
address poverty in Gabon. Where i t disagreed was on the mechanics of how to do this. The Bank’s
informal public expenditure review showed that the main problem was not a lack o f resources allocated to
the social sectors, but rather the poor management of those resources. Too much was spent on “high end”
services available only to the elite, at the expense of programs in primary health care and basic education.
Reorienting social services and social protection to increase their impact on poverty would require
fundamental administrative reforms and improved governance. Much could be achieved without
increasing the fiscal burden or changing the present pattern of income distribution. However, the
Government preferred to pursue an approach based on disengaging the state from productive activities
and hoping that the private sector would generate sufficient, and sufficiently remunerative, employment
so that the social status quo could be maintained. The links between the corrective actions needed in the

But which was never published by the Bank due to deficiencies in the underlying data. However, the review was
circulated in draft form and was much appreciated by the clients, according to information received during the CASCR
consultations.

-65-

health and education sectors and the outcomes desired b y Government were not sufficiently explained,
and are s t i l l not fully understood by many highly placed decision makers.
The Government also developed an HIV/AIDS Action Plan and would have liked Bank support
in implementing the plan. However, i t was not prepared to borrow on IBRD terms for that purpose. I t
felt that the findings o f the Poverty Assessment ought to justify concessional lending. If such terms were
not available from the Bank, i t would go elsewhere, or as a last resort, would finance social programs
from i t s own resources. The result, of course, i s that relatively little has been done to combat H I V / A I D S
in Gabon, and no attempt has been made to mobilize and empower groups outside the Ministry o f Health
for t h i s purpose.
The extent to which the goals and objectives of the CAS were really shared b y the Bank and the
Government i s illustrated by the extent to which progress has been made during CAS implementation.
Where the Bank has been able to provide support, progress has been made, although more slowly than
originally planned. Where the Bank has not been able to provide support, some progress has also been
made, although possibly not in directions that the Bank would have preferred. Other donors have been
key to achieving t h i s progress. Also, the commitment of many high-level c i v i l servants to the reform
agenda should not be underestimated. Civil society has not yet been able to play much of a role in
holding government to account, but i t s capacity i s growing and i t s voices are increasingly being heard.
Overall assessment. In summary, the CAS performance can be rated as “moderately
unsatisfactory”. The country assistance program was relevant to broad national goals, but was not well
aligned with government views about how to achieve those goals. The country did not make acceptable
progress towards a majority o f the proposed CAS outcomes, although i t did make significant progress on
privatization and some progress on macroeconomic management and capacity building. The CAS
expectations were probably unrealistic under the best of circumstances, particularly in the area o f poverty
alleviation. Furthermore, the resources available to the country team were far too limited to provide all
the non-lending support foreseen in the CAS.

This raises an issue related to Bank performance which i s not within the direct managerial
responsibility of the Country Team. The CAS presented a vision of what could be done in Gabon.
Indeed, i t was recognized as a “best practice” CAS. In reviewing the draft CAS, regional management
failed to point out the discrepancy between i t s ambitious objectives and the resources which management
was prepared to put at the disposal of the Country Team. While i t i s not certain that more resources
would have produced a more satisfactory outcome, i t i s certain that inadequate resources forced the Bank
to withdraw from several sectors where i t should have been providing leadership which slowed the pace
of change in many areas.

E.

Lessons L e a r n e d for Subsequent CAS Design

The CAS would have benefited from a more frank and open dialogue between the Bank and the
Government during i t s preparation. On the Bank side, there should have been a more accurate appraisal
of the amount of support that could likely be delivered, given budget constraints. Stakeholder analysis
might also have revealed the likely strength o f opposition to the reform agenda, and the weak capacity o f
civil society, especially the relatively poor, to hold the Government accountable in any meaningful way.
The Bank’s strong commitment to pursue poverty alleviation may have prevented recognition of the
Government’s views about the relative unimportance of t h i s problem in comparison to the problem of
managing external debt. At the same time, the Government allowed the Bank to believe that i t agreed
with the CAS agenda, in order to mobilize “free” TA and grant resources, while in fact i t had no intention
of borrowing for public sector reform or poverty alleviation.

-66-

The Bank was also not very straightforward in i t s description of the poverty situation in Gabon.
In an attempt to heighten consciousness of the problem of inequity or relative poverty, which indeed may
present a political challenge at some point in Gabon’s history, the Bank has tended to overstate the
problem in comparison to other countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. While i t i s true that Gabon’s social
indicators are much lower than they ought to be, given i t s income level, they are no worse than, and in
many cases better than, those of most low-income countries. The incidence of extreme poverty,
according to international income-based definitions, i s lower than in many countries, calling for a more
targeted approach to poverty alleviation. The solutions in Gabon may not be the same as in most of SubSaharan Africa. In fact, the Bank’s approach has largely focused on improving the distribution o f wealth
through redirecting public resources to social services more directly targeted to the poor. The Bank has
done relatively little to address the need for economic diversification and employment generation to
increase the productivity of the poor. Furthermore, the Bank has paid surprisingly little attention to
HIV/AIDS in Gabon, which i s a genuine concern of the country and which has reached prevalence levels
(above 7%) that ought also to be of concern to the Bank.
The CAS did not address directly Government concerns about “social peace,” which lie at the
heart o f the rent redistribution system. The delicate balance of power among social groups which has
been built through this system i s a significant source of resistance to change and the problems which have
been experienced in implementing and sustaining reforms. This balance w i l l of course grow more
difficult to maintain as Government’s discretionary revenues decrease over time. Furthermore, there i s a
real risk that improved economic performance w i l l result in rising expectations and increasing demand for
services from c i v i l society. The challenge to the Government i s to manage t h i s transition so that human
needs are more effectively and efficiently met while social peace i s maintained. Defining the challenge in
this way might better capture the area of shared concern between the Bank and the Government.
I t i s possible that in the end results would not have improved b y a more realistic CAS and may
have simply further reduced the resources available to the country team. Resources that were eventually
redirected towards policy dialogue and technical support on issues that were important both to the Bank
and to the Government. B y articulating the agenda for poverty alleviation, in consultation with the donor
community, the CAS, however, established a work program that was pursued by the Government and
other donors at a more realistic pace, driven b y the hope of debt rescheduling and IMF balance of
payments support. This work has laid a foundation for continuing dialogue and may eventually result in
agreement on sound sector strategies and a medium term expenditure framework. The Bank may then be
able to play a role in mobilizing resources for poverty alleviation, by convening donor roundtables or b y
direct lending.

Sustainability. Achievements in macroeconomic management are mixed but likely to be
sustainable, with occasional interruptions, at least as long as Gabon requires the support of the IMF. The
country has made progress in debt reduction and has nearly eliminated the fiscal burden o f parastatal
enterprises. I t w i l l remain dependent on oil revenues in the short to medium term. Should o i l revenues
fall dramatically (which does not seem immediately likely in view of the prevailing high o i l prices), the
Government could become eligible for blend or even IDA borrowing. However, the sustainability of
present levels of public expenditure w i l l depend in the long run on successful development o f the private
sector.

The achievements of the CAS in the area o f private sector development should be sustainable, as
in most cases they are irreversible. The unfinished privatization agenda i s likely to be finished in the not
very distant future. However, regulatory and institutional capacity remains very weak, and substantial
additional support w i l l be needed to internalize these changes. Improved transparency in procurement
and the rule of law w i l l be necessary to sustain growth in the private sector. More attention needs to be
paid to the supply side in addressing the critical problem of youth unemployment.

-67-

On strengthening public sector efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in sectors critical for
poverty alleviation, the CAS outcomes are mixed and in general disappointing. So far, the Government’s
approach to poverty alleviation has been to seek additional investment more than to improve the
management of existing resources. I t has been noted that real public sector reform would require
“nothing less than a culture change on the part of Gabon’s public sector.”” The Bank has not yet learned
how to induce such a culture change in the absence of strong economic or political imperatives.
One program that seems to have been successful in promoting culture change i s that undertaken
under the Urban LIL. Though limited in scale, t h i s program has succeeded in improving living conditions
in underserved urban neighborhoods with broad community participation and the collaboration of local
authorities. I t also helped to build capacity among small contractors and temporarily alleviated the
pressing problem of unemployment. However, the small-scale works undertaken b y the project do not
fully meet the aspirations o f the people, especially local politicians. Whether this approach can be
successfully “scaled up” remains to be seen.
The agenda on building the capacity o f civil society was almost entirely placed in the hands of
other donors or institutions. I t was not strongly supported b y Government, and so i t did not become a
priority for the donor community. Consequently, little was accomplished in t h i s area. Still, there i s an
emerging civil society in Gabon, which wants and needs to become a true partner in development. In
particular, i t w i l l be necessary to involve civil society (as well as Parliament, and the private sector) more
fully in the preparation of the forthcoming PRSP, as their commitment and participation w i l l be needed in
i t s implementation and monitoring. The Bank has recently taken steps to assist the Government in
developing a participatory process for the PRSP. This initiative needs to be supported and sustained b y
the Bank as well as the rest of the donor community.
Institutional capacity. There were, indeed, major issues concerning country institutional
capacity, that emerged both in the attempts to implement agreed policy reforms and in ‘the implementation
o f ongoing projects. The CAS agenda focused largely on creating the legal and institutional frameworks
for change. Where such efforts have been successful, capacity constraints have become evident, and i t i s
clear that future programs should focus even more strongly on capacity building in government, in small
and medium size enterprises, and in civil society. Capacity building means more than training and
equipment, although these may well be necessary. Both attitudinal and behavioral change w i l l be needed,
and these w i l l have to “trickle down,” at least in government institutions, from the top. Improved
communications and a freer flow o f information w i l l be essential to success. On a more mundane level,
to the extent that Bank projects (including grants) are implemented b y people unfamiliar with Bank
procedures, i t w i l l be necessary to ensure that appropriate training i s provided and strong support i s given
to the teams responsible for project implementation. Annual Public Expenditure Reviews would be
helpful in ensuring that adequate counterpart funds are budgeted and available when needed.

The consultation process for the 1998 CAS created expectations which neither the Government
nor the Bank was prepared to fulfill. Participation by c i v i l society was s t i l l a new idea, and there was
little analysis by the Bank of the stakes or the stakeholders. Consultation took place around a vision for
the future, perhaps not fully grounded in the realities of the past. Consultation was also largely limited to
selected agendas such as the transport sector strategy or the poverty alleviation program. The overall
design of the CAS and the relationships of i t s different parts were not apparent to a wide audience. To
improve on this, i t w i l l be necessary to start consultation much sooner (as has been done) and to base it on
a shared assessment of past programs and results. Many misunderstandings may need to be expressed
and explained. More extensive and sustained communication with the public w i l l be needed, including
10

identifiable groups such as labor, university students, small businessmen, women, traditional authorities,
and local government officials. A truly participatory CAS process in Gabon w i l l take a long time (as w i l l
a participatory PRSP process), but i t i s likely to produce more sustainable programs and more realistic
targets for the next CAS.
Summary.
The performance of the 1998 CAS has been rated “moderately
unsatisfactory”. This result i s due to deficiencies on the part of both the Bank and the Government. In
the first place, the CAS did not represent a realistic assessment o f what the Government was prepared to
do or what the Bank was prepared to support over the next three years. This can partly be explained by
shifts in high-level management in both the Bank and Government that intervened shortly after the CAS
was completed. However, Bank management bears the responsibility for approving and sending forward
a CAS which i t was not prepared to support with adequate resources. The lesson for the future may be
that a CAS should be costed, at least internally, and compared to foreseeable budget allocations. A
corollary i s that when the Bank i s called upon to play the role of a “Knowledge Bank,” country budgeting
should not be based solely on the size of the lending program.

A second factor affecting CAS performance was the extended hiatus in Bank presence in the
field. After setting up a Country Office with a Resident Representative, the Bank (and the Government)
sent mixed signals which undermined his effectiveness. After his return to Washington, more than a year
passed before a suitable replacement could be found. Meanwhile, there was little continuity in the
Country Economist position, although the dialogue seems to have been maintained at a fairly consistent
level. There has been rather more continuity in the Country Team as a whole, and supervision o f ongoing
projects has, b y and large, been effective. Close collaboration between the Bank and the IMF, with a
growing emphasis on governance, has been a factor in the relative success of the macroeconomic
management component. In contrast, the inability of the Bank to deliver much support in areas related to
poverty reduction probably has much to do with the slow pace o f progress in t h i s area. The lack of an
effective Bank presence in the field also constrained collaboration with other donors during t h i s period.
Finally, the CAS agenda was congruent with Government objectives when seen in the long run.
Some progress has been made, but not at the pace that was expected. More stakeholder analysis, and a
more restricted reform agenda for each operation, might have improved the chances for success. For the
future CAS, i t w i l l be necessary to set even sharper priorities and to concentrate Bank resources on areas
of real comparative advantage. Continued collaboration with other donors, and broadened consultation
and communication with c i v i l society, w i l l be essential. These are likely to develop further through the
process of PRSP preparation.

ANNEX 6. Gabon: Country Financing Parameters
(April, 2005)
The country financing parameters for the Gabonese Republic below have been approved by the Regional
Vice President, Africa Region.

I

Parameter

ExplanatiodRemarks

Cost Sharing. Limit on the
proportion o f individual
projects that the Bank may
finance

100%

The actual Bank financing share would be
determined during the preparation of each new
project and are likely to be about 90% of the
project cost in most cases. Financing up to
100% w i l l be applied on a selective case b y
case and meridjustification basis, particularly
for activities supported by IDF grants.

Recurrent cost financing.
Limits, if any, to the
overall amount of
recurrent expenditures that
the Bank may finance

N o country-level
limit

In individual projects, the Bank would take into

account sustainability issues at the project and
sector level, including: (i)
the sustainability o f
project achievements and Bank-financed
the implied future
recurrent costs; and (ii)
budgetary outlays. The level of Bank financing
of recurrent costs i s expected to be a relatively
low share of total project costs, and i s mainly
expected to be for salaries and operating costs
associated with project implementation.

Local costfinancing. Are
the requirements for Bank
financing of local
expenditures met, namely
financing
that: (i)
requirements for the
country’s development
program would exceed the
public sector’s own
resources (e.g., from
taxation and other
revenues) and expected
domestic borrowing; and
(ii)
the financing of foreign
expenditures alone would
not enable the Bank to
assist in the financing of
individual projects

Yes

The requirements for local cost financing are
met. The Bank may finance local costs in any
proportions required by individual projects.

Taxes and duties. Are
there any taxes and duties
that the Bank would not
finance

None

There are no unreasonable taxes and duties.
The Bank may finance all taxes and duties
associated with project expenditures. At the
project-level, the Bank would consider whether
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high
share of project costs.
