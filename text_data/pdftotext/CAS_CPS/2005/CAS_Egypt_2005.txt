ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The World Bank Group greatly appreciates the cooperation of Government of Egypt in
the preparation of this CAS. Government officials gave generously of their time and ideas
at various stages and the final product has benefited greatly from their inputs. Nongovernment stakeholders were also consulted during the preparation of the CAS and their
contributions are also appreciated.
By its design, a CAS is a group effort and the Egypt CAS has been no exception to this
rule. Within the Bank, the team effort was reflected in the fact that numerous staff
provided suggestions and ideas at several country team meetings and written comments
on various drafts. We are grateful to all who have contributed to this CAS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
The key development objectives of the Government of Egypt (GOE), as expressed in its
planning documents, are the “achievement of high and sustainable GDP growth” and the
“alleviation of poverty and attenuation of income disparities.” To achieve these objectives, the
Government seeks to make more use of the private sector as a development agent as well as better
leverage the role of the public sector in the economy. Broadly speaking, the growth-enhancing
potential of the private sector is to be harnessed through improving the business climate across a
broad range of policies (covering trade, finance, and taxation, among others) while the
complementary role of the public sector is to be strengthened through enhancing the provision of
public services such as infrastructure, education, and macroeconomic stability, among others.
Inter alia, this two-pronged growth strategy is expected to help Egypt cope with the challenge of
reducing unemployment in the context of a growing labor force. Government also intends to
pursue equity through redesigning social policies to meet national welfare objectives in a more
effective and efficient manner. In addition, for disadvantaged groups that are unable to participate
in the mainstream of economic growth or who are adversely affected by economic reforms,
Government intends to strengthen its social safety net system so that more of the vulnerable are
covered by it, and its effectiveness is enhanced through administrative decentralization,
community-based approaches, and the use of NGOs. Finally, inter-regional equity is to be
improved in part through targeted investments in Upper Egypt.
ii.
There is a broad overlap between the thinking of the GOE and that of the Bank Group
with regard to Egypt’s key development challenges and reform agenda. The Bank Group
proposes to help the GOE achieve its goals by aligning its support over the next four years
(FY06-09) to three key strategic objectives, namely, facilitating private sector development,
enhancing the provision of public services, and promoting equity.
iii.
With regard to facilitating private sector development, support by the Bank, IFC, MIGA
and FIAS will be directed to achieving three specific outcomes. These are: (a) a financial sector
that is more efficient, and responsive to private sector needs; (b) an international trade regime that
features lower transaction costs and (c) a business climate that features lower transaction costs for
starting, running and shutting down business operations.
iv.
With regard to enhancing the provision of public services, Bank Group support will be
devoted to ensuring that (a) fiscal and monetary policy are consistent with the requirements of
macroeconomic stability; (b) there is an increase in the supply and improvement in the efficiency
of infrastructure services (such as power, transport and telecommunications, among others); (c)
the quality and relevance of education is improved at all levels; (d) air and water quality are
improved and water resources are managed efficiently; (e) the coverage, quality and financial
sustainability of the social insurance system is improved and (f) public sector agencies become
more accountable.
v.
With regard to promoting equity, Bank Group support will aim to (a) improve the
coverage and effectiveness of safety nets; (b) reduce disparities between Upper and Lower Egypt;
(c) improve access and quality of healthcare for the poor; and (d) reduce gender disparities.
vi.
Measures to achieve the above goals and implement the above strategies have already
been introduced. The Cabinet appointed in July 2004 has embarked on a far-reaching reform
program. Some bold reform measures have already been initiated while plans have been
announced for others. At the same time, the growth rate of the economy has picked up, helped by

iii

policy reforms and favorable external developments. Thus, the political and economic context
for the present CAS is very different from that prevailing at the time the last CAS was prepared
(June 2001). The earlier CAS was introduced at a time when economic growth was slowing and
the political will to pursue reforms appeared to be waning. The current context features both a
revival of growth and of interest in reforms. There now exists a remarkable opportunity for the
Bank Group and other development partners to harness their financial and technical support for
Egypt to an improving economy bolstered by a credible reform program.
vii.
In view of the much improved context, the Bank can make available more support than
has been possible in recent years. A base case program of $500 million a year on average is
proposed in order to support the key development objectives of the CAS over FY06-09. From a
structural policy and macroeconomic perspective Egypt is already considered to be in the base
case and the objective of Bank Group financing and analytic support would be to maintain the
present macroeconomic and reform status.
viii.
A high case lending scenario with an average commitment of $700 million per annum is
also envisaged. Included in the high case are two quick-disbursing loans to support financial
sector reforms that are considered central to improving the climate for private sector
development. The triggers for moving to the high case will be twofold: first, evidence of
implementation of substantive financial sector reforms and second, a financing plan for meeting
the total funding needs of the financial sector reform program that shows at least 10 percent of
funding being obtained from non-debt-creating sources. Adherence to such a financing plan will
help contain the rise in public debt that is expected from the restructuring of the financial sector.
ix.
Finally, a low case scenario, with a lending envelope limited to $250 million per annum,
would result from policy-driven deterioration of the main macroeconomic indicators or a
significant dilution of the current program of structural reform. On the macroeconomic side, a
weakening of the good monetary and exchange rate policies followed in recent years or a
deterioration in the consolidated fiscal deficit for reasons unrelated to the proposed trade, tax and
financial sector reforms, would raise concerns about the sustainability of a 5 percent or higher
growth trajectory. On the structural side, a significant dilution of the present program of trade,
tax, investment climate and financial sector reforms would create similar concerns. If such
conditions arise, the Bank would move to a low case lending program of about $250 million per
annum.
x.
The program to be supported by the CAS could face risks from both external and
domestic sources including: a slowdown of growth in OECD countries that are important sources
of demand for Egyptian goods and services; regional instability that could affect tourism and
foreign investment flows; domestic social and political tensions that may result in economic
disruption and interruption of reform momentum; and weaknesses in the institutional capacity to
manage the reform process. Some reassurance can be drawn from the fact that the external
environment is presently favorable and that Egypt has successfully managed an ambitious reform
program in the 1990s. The Bank can mitigate the risks as well by providing strategic and highimpact financial support, continuing to demonstrate the expected benefits of selected reforms
through quality analytical work, and helping to build coalitions of support within Government,
civil society and the international community. However, what is likely to be of decisive
importance in the success of this CAS is the degree of ownership of the reform agenda exhibited
by the Government of Egypt. At present, this is demonstrably high.

iv

xi.

The following issues are suggested for the consideration of the Board:
•

Is the CAS structured to adequately meet the needs of a middle-income client of the
Bank Group? Is the mix of analytic work and financial support appropriate? Is the
proposed strategy sufficiently flexible?

•

Given the specific circumstances of Egypt today, is the emphasis on facilitating
private sector development, enhancing the provision of public services, and
promoting equity appropriate?

•

Are the risks to the CAS adequately described and addressed?

Egypt experienced high growth in the second half of the 1990s following the adoption of a
structural adjustment program. A structural adjustment program was undertaken by the
Government of Egypt in 1991 to cope with the severe macroeconomic instability that had arisen
in the second half of the 1980s. Between 1986 and 1990, this instability was reflected in high
fiscal deficits (reaching 15 percent of GDP), high inflation (exceeding 20 percent in some years),
large current account deficits, and currency
volatility (the black market premium on the
Figure 1. GDP growth in Egypt
Egyptian pound exceeded 70 percent on two

occasions in this period). Partly as a result

of this instability and partly as a result of an

ongoing slowdown in world economic

demand, economic growth in Egypt

collapsed to 1 percent in FY91. The
2
stabilization and reform effort that was
1
launched thereafter had quick and
substantial effects. Over the next four years,

the fiscal deficit fell to 1.3 percent of GDP
while inflation returned to single-digit
values. A sharp devaluation of the pound
resulted in significant improvement in the current account position, virtual elimination of the
black market premium, and rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. A major
privatization effort was undertaken, resulting in the sale of about 21 percent of all SOE assets
between 1991 and 1998. Trade was gradually liberalized, with the average tariff rate falling from
27.8 in 1991 to 20.5 in 1998. The economy revived and grew by around 4 percent per annum on
average during FY92-95 before accelerating to a 5.5 percent average during FY96-00.

Economic growth and investment levels faltered after 2000. After the strong run-up of the
late 1990s, Egypt’s GDP growth rate

averaging only around 3.2 percent per
40
annum. The loss of growth momentum was
accompanied by a decrease in both private

and public investment. Private investment
has declined from around 11 percent of GDP

in 1998 to around 8 percent currently. This
low level is a cause for concern since it is

and employment. Public investment has
fallen from around 15 percent of GDP in
1998 to around 8 percent currently. While

helpful from a short-term debt management
perspective, this decline is also a cause for

1

concern since it may have compromised the infrastructure base that Egypt needs for future
growth. At 16 percent of GDP, the domestic investment rate in Egypt is about two-thirds of the
level observed in the top ten fastest-growing lower middle income countries in the world.
3.
Fiscal deficits have been rising, leading to concerns about fiscal and public debt
sustainability. Fiscal deficits began rising after

sector) or 2.7 percent of GDP (using the
consolidated definition).1 The net public debt level Source : Calculated from MoF data published by CBE
corresponding to the consolidated deficit, as derived from data published by the Central Bank of
Egypt, stood at 88 percent of GDP at end-FY04.
4.
A growth revival now appears to be underway helped by policy reforms and favorable
external developments. The growth rate of the economy picked up in 2004, rising to 4.4 percent.
This was most likely due to certain policy reforms as well as to favorable external developments.
A key domestic policy reform consisted of the flotation of the Egyptian pound in early 2003.
Despite some hitches in the initial management of the float, the substantial depreciation (of about
35 percent) that occurred during 2003 helped boost Egypt’s foreign exchange earnings from such
sources as tourism and manufactured exports, thus contributing to the growth pick-up. A key
external development that worked in Egypt’s favor during 2004 was the increase in world
economic demand. World economic growth rose from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 4.0 percent in 2004,
helping increase traffic (and Government revenues) through the Suez Canal as well as demand for
key Egyptian exports. Foreign exchange earnings have also been boosted by exports of recentlydeveloped gas resources and by rising oil prices.
Poverty and Human Development Trends2
5.
Poverty was reduced during the second half of the 1990s. Between FY96 and FY2000, the
poverty incidence rate declined from 19.4 percent to 16.7 percent. This decline may be attributed
in part to the overall growth of the economy during that period. The two regions (Lower and
Metropolitan Egypt) that grew the fastest during this period also experienced the most rapid rates
of poverty reduction. By contrast, Upper Egypt grew the slowest and actually experienced an
increase in poverty. In more recent years, the poverty situation may have deteriorated since the
average growth rate of the economy has been lower than in the late 1990s and since inflation has
been somewhat higher. More information on poverty trends during FY00-FY05 will become
available once the 2005 Household Income and Expenditure Survey is completed and analyzed.

1

A new fiscal reporting system was adopted by Egypt in FY00. This distinguishes between three
definitions of the public sector. The first and narrowest definition covers only the central government,
local administration and public service authorities. The second (“broad”) version includes as well the
accounts of the General Authority for the Supply of Commodities (GASC) and the National Investment
Bank (NIB). The third (“consolidated”) definition incorporates the Social Insurance Funds (SIFs). The
consolidated concept yields lower deficit and debt levels since the SIFs are a net source of financing.

6.
Egypt has a good record in providing education to its citizens. Educational attainments in
the country have been rising steadily. Between 1980 and 2002, gross primary enrolment rates rose
from 73 percent to 96 percent while secondary enrolment rates rose from 50 percent to 85
percent, a performance that is among the best in the MENA region as well as among lower
middle income countries. Nevertheless, many challenges remain, chief among these being the
improvement of education quality, the achievement of cost effectiveness, and the provision of
access to underserved groups in remote locations.
7.
Steady progress has been made in improving health indicators but significant challenges
remain. Life expectancy at birth increased from 55.5 years in 1980 to 68.9 years by 2002, thus
catching up with the MENA average which is currently at 68.6 years. Over the same time period,
the under-five mortality rate fell from 173 per 1000 to 39, a performance that is substantially
better than the average in MENA which fell from 134 to 54. Maternal care has also improved
and maternal mortality rates are now estimated to be around 84 per 100,000 live births. As with
education, however, important challenges remain. Significant inequities persist in health
outcomes: among the poorest income quintiles, infant mortality rates stood at 76 per 1000 live
births, compared to 30 among the highest quintile households. At the same time, the impact of
the demographic transition, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles is contributing to
proportionate increase in non-communicable diseases and injuries. This shift in disease profile
will necessitate changes to the health services that will significantly increase the cost of health
care. Unless this transition is carefully managed, this could lead to a major cost escalation in the
health sector without commensurate improvements in health outcomes, which could negatively
affect labor productivity. Thus, Egypt faces the dual challenge of improving access to health care
and health outcomes among the poor while raising the quality and efficiency of health services to
meet the rising demand for more costly health services.
8.
Safety nets for the poor exist but can be much improved. The public safety net system in
Egypt consists of various subsidies, employment programs, and cash transfer arrangements.
However, there is much room for improvement in the cost-effectiveness of the safety net and its
coverage of the poor. There are major targeting issues amongst the different programs since
many of them benefit the non-poor more than the poor. Approximately one million families in
Egypt are covered by cash transfer programs but only about 15 percent of these families qualify
as poor by the national poverty line criterion. Moreover, for those that do have access, such
transfers are meager and make up only around 5 percent of their total income.

Substantial progress has been made
with respect to gender disparities. As a

greater improvement has been achieved in

Upper Egypt where average GERs were
lowest for girls. Improvements in access to
public health and information have resulted in lower maternal mortality rates, higher
contraceptive rates and lower fertility. There has also been progress in women’s economic
empowerment, as reflected in the increase in women’s participation in the labor force from 18
percent in 1994 to 22 percent in 2004 and in women’s access to credit (for SMEs) rising from 10

3

percent in 1994 to 27 percent in 2004. Legislative efforts have helped empower women. These
include the Family Tribunal Law, the Nationality Law and the Family Court Law as well as
measures strengthening a woman’s right to divorce, all of which have built stronger legal rights
and privileges for women and children.

Population ages 15-64 (% of
total)

10. Egypt is currently undergoing a demographic transition which offers both challenges and
opportunities. The share of the working age population in Egypt’s total population has been
increasing since the early 1990s. Projections suggest that this increase will continue until it
plateaus at about 67 percent in 2020. If
Figure 5. Demographic Transition in
the economy manages to absorb the

creation of productive private sector
jobs, this could boost economic growth
65%
and increase the savings rate. Combined

with declining fertility, this would create
the potential for a virtuous cycle leading

to further growth acceleration as the

would likely exacerbate social pressures.
At almost 11 percent (higher for fresh
graduates, especially women), unemployment is already quite high and a focus of attention in
policy making circles.
B. Political Context
11. Political stability and economic reforms. As is well known, stability and continuity have
been prominent features of Egypt’s political system for several decades now. This system has
proved able to accommodate both rapid and substantial changes in the nature and content of
economic policies, a prominent example from the 1990s being the adoption of a comprehensive
structural adjustment program in 1991 and more recent examples being the flotation of the
currency in 2003 and the reinvigoration of reform efforts in 2004.
12. The Cabinet appointed in July 2004 has embarked on a far-reaching reform program. The
mandate of the new government is to improve living standards, promote investment, reduce
unemployment, contain inflation, and improve the performance of the financial system and of
administrative bodies. Some bold reform measures have already been initiated while plans have
been announced for others. The government plans to facilitate private sector development through
improving trade policies, financial sector performance, and business regulations. The scope for
the private sector is to be expanded through further privatization and public-private investment
partnerships in such areas as infrastructure projects. Public sector reforms will aim at enhancing
the provision of public goods (such as physical and social infrastructure) and improving the
delivery of public services in general.
13. The success of the reform effort will depend, in part, on its social consequences. The
success of the reform effort will partly depend on public support which, in turn, will depend on
whether the consequences of the reforms are perceived to be inequitable and burdensome for
vulnerable groups. Since some of the reforms will have an impact on employment and price
levels in certain sectors and for certain commodities, it will be important to ascertain which

4

groups are most likely to be affected and to design measures to mitigate the impact on these
groups.
14. A more open and competitive political system is in prospect. Recently, at the
recommendation of the President, Parliament changed the relevant clauses in the Constitution to
allow for multiple candidates to run for the office of the President with the winner to be chosen in
a direct and secret balloting procedure. It is likely, therefore, that a more competitive political
system may develop in the future, providing a new vent for the full range of public opinion that
prevails in the country. The new system of choosing the President will be applied in the elections
that are due in September 2005.
II. DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS
A. The Development Agenda
15. The key development objectives and targets of the Government of Egypt are expressed in
the Fifth Five Year Plan for Socio-Economic Development covering the years 2002-2007. The
introductory part of this document sets out a longer term – twenty year – vision as well. Among
important elements of Egypt’s long term vision of development are the “achievement of high and
sustainable GDP growth” and the “alleviation of poverty and attenuation of income disparities.”
The strategy for achieving these objectives is set out in general terms in the Five Year Plan
document and in more specific terms in policy papers produced by the governing party, the
3
National Democratic Party. More recently, the top priorities of the current Cabinet have been
listed in a 10-point program announced by the Prime Minister in an address to the Egyptian
Parliament.
16. According to these sources, Egypt seeks to achieve growth with equity by making more use
of the private sector as a development agent as well as by changing the role of the government in
managing the economy. Broadly speaking, the growth-enhancing potential of the private sector is
to be harnessed through improving the business climate across a broad range of issues (including
trade, finance, and taxation, among others) while the complementary role of the public sector is to
be strengthened through enhancing the provision of public services such as infrastructure,
education, and macroeconomic stability. Inter alia, this two-pronged growth strategy is
anticipated to help Egypt cope with the challenge of reducing unemployment in the context of a
growing labor force. Government also intends to pursue the equity objective through redesigning
its social policies to incorporate social insurance mechanisms that meet national welfare
objectives in an effective and efficient manner. In addition, for disadvantaged groups that are
unable to participate in the mainstream of economic growth or who are adversely affected by
economic reforms, Government intends to strengthen its social safety net system so that more of
the vulnerable are covered by it, and its effectiveness is enhanced through administrative
decentralization, community-based approaches, and the use of NGOs. Finally, inter-regional
equity is to be improved through targeted investments in Upper Egypt.
17. It would be fair to say that there currently exists a broad overlap between the thinking of
the GOE and the Bank Group regarding Egypt’s key development challenges and reform agenda.
There is concurrence on the objective of pursuing broad-based growth in order to meet
employment and poverty challenges, and also on the importance of using the private sector as the

While these papers do not necessarily describe actual Government policies in all cases, they provide a
strong sense of the future policy agenda reflecting the thrust of thinking within top policy-making circles.
Topics covered include monetary policy, taxation reform, management of public utilities and economic
organizations, public debt management, education, health, social insurance, industrial policy, development
of small and medium enterprises, private sector participation in infrastructure projects, capital market
development, and trade and investment policies.

main engine of growth while facilitating its ability to do this through strategic public investments
in infrastructure and human resource development. There is agreement as well regarding the
point that growth by itself will not necessarily resolve the special challenges faced by regions
such as Upper Egypt and, therefore, the growth strategy will have to be supplemented by some
specific measures aimed at regional equity.
18. With regard to the reform agenda discussed in detail below, such areas as the financial
sector, the trade regime, taxation, and the regulatory regime were identified as high priority areas
for structural reform in discussions among the GOE, the Bank Group, and other donors in recent
years. For example, the reforms announced for the financial sector echo elements of the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) completed by the Bank and the IMF in December 2002.
Similarly, the restructuring of the tariff system is in line with recommendations made by the Bank
in discussions related to a possible policy-based loan in 2003 while customs reform measures
currently being implemented are linked to a program supported by technical assistance from
many development partners. The tax reform bill currently before Parliament has benefited from
technical advice from the IMF and many of the regulatory or investment climate reforms being
considered are connected with ongoing advisory work of the Bank under the rubric of the
Investment Climate Assessment.

Facilitating Private Sector Development
19. Financial sector challenges. The Egyptian financial sector is characterized by inefficiency
and weaknesses in intermediation due primarily to the dominance of state ownership. In the
banking subsector, four major state-owned banks account for almost 58 percent of assets, earn
lower net interest margins than private banks, have higher operating costs and have been slow to
modernize and innovate. The quality of their portfolios is widely considered to be poor. The
insurance subsector is also dominated by public ownership and is under-developed in the sense of
having annual premium income of less than 1.1 percent of GDP and offering only a limited range
of services, in some cases not even extending to the coverage of basic risks. Non-bank financial
institutions such as the mortgage market, financial leasing, and venture capital remain limited in
scope and activity. The stock market remains thin with trading confined largely to 30 or so
companies, despite recent positive trends in market capitalization (up 36 percent to LE 234 billion
in 2004), trading volume (up 30 percent to LE 36.1 billion in 2004) and average valuations (the
Capital Market Authority (CMA) general index rose by almost 51 percent in 2004). Other
challenges include that of expanding access to financial services, through electronic payment
mechanisms and/or through non-bank channels such as the postal network, for example.
20. To improve the performance and soundness of the financial sector, Government has
proposed a series of bold measures as follows:4
•

In the banking subsector, reform objectives include: merging the six most poorly
performing banks with larger, better-performing banks, privatization of public sector
shares in joint venture banks and operational restructuring of the public sector banks
(PSBs); privatization of one of the big four PSBs (namely Bank of Alexandria) and
recapitalization of some other PSBs; and setting up at the Central Bank of Egypt of a unit
for monitoring non-performing loans and a referee committee to streamline the process of
rescheduling non-performing loans, loan recovery and repossession of collateral.

•

In the insurance subsector, reform objectives include: privatizing one of the state-owned
insurance companies; major restructuring of the remaining state-owned companies;
encouraging private sector participation; strengthening of insurance regulations and the

Program: 2005-2008 issued by the Ministry of Investment in October 2004.

6

underlying accounting principles and commercial codes; and achieving full compliance
with GATS commitments regarding the liberalization of this sector.
•

In the capital markets subsector, reform objectives include: improving corporate
governance through better information disclosure, more vigorous enforcement actions
and compliance with international codes and standards; and increasing market liquidity
and efficiency through allowing margin trading and establishing a primary dealers
system.

•

In the mortgage market, the goal is to create a more active, competitive and sustainable
mortgage market by establishing a transparent system to protect property rights and
streamline real estate registration; facilitating foreclosure procedures; improving housing
affordability; and reducing lending and funding risks for mortgage lenders and investors
in mortgage securities.

•

The financial sector reform program also includes measures related to financial leasing
companies, factoring, and venture capital. In particular, steps are being considered to
improve the credit information system that should in turn improve access to credit,
especially for small and medium firms. Finally, an important objective of the reform
program is to strengthen financial regulations and supervision. Towards this end, steps
have been taken to separate the monetary policy function from the bank supervision
function within the central bank, and to unify all non-bank financial services policies
under one ministry (namely the Ministry of Investment).

21. Trade-related issues. Egypt carried out significant trade policy reforms during the 1990s.
However, there was a slackening of the reform effort at the turn of the decade, especially when
viewed in comparison to changes taking place in other parts of the world. Egypt’s export
performance deteriorated in this period, contributing to the slowdown in overall economic
growth. To regain momentum in this area, the government adopted a floating exchange rate
system in 2003 and took steps to improve the functioning of the interbank foreign exchange
market in 2004. In addition, it has recently introduced a number of measures that aim to enhance
the competitiveness of domestic industry. These include: reducing the number of tariff bands
from 27 to 6, cutting the average (weighted) tariff rate from 14.6 percent to 9.1 percent, and
removing fees and surcharges on some imports so as to bring Egypt into compliance with
commitments made to the WTO. Import liberalization is to be complemented by measures to
simplify custom procedures, rationalize the regime under which imports are inspected for
compliance with Egyptian standards, develop transport infrastructure (roads, airports and sea
ports), provide assistance to SMEs in foreign marketing, and facilitate insurance against export
risks. The government also intends to take maximum advantage of free trade and partnership
agreements and opportunities with the EU, the US and Arab countries. Recently, Egypt has
entered into a Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) agreement that will allow it to export certain
products (especially textiles) to the US market without quota restraints and free of tariffs.
22. The GOE is aware that Internet technologies can enhance trade and competitiveness, not
least as marketing channels. E-commerce, though increasing, remains constrained by legal and
administrative barriers. However, awareness of e-commerce potential is growing and some
enabling legislation (notably on e-signatures) has been developed. Challenges include
strengthening laws and regulations on electronic transactions, including electronic contracting, epayment, security, privacy, crime and protection of intellectual property rights; as well as
increasing access to information and communications infrastructure, particularly outside major
urban areas.

7

23. Privatization. Despite substantial privatization during the 1990s, the stock of state-owned
companies remains significant. The current Cabinet intends to follow an asset management
approach with the objective of maximizing returns from the restructuring or sale of state-owned
companies. Ultimately, the idea is to greatly reduce the number of state-owned companies so as
to minimize the involvement of the state in areas where private sector enterprises can function
effectively. Significant progress has been made since July 2004 in that 19 companies have
already been sold; another 83 are listed for sale during the remainder of 2005.
24. Tax rates and administration. Tax rates are currently as high as 42 percent for many
corporations although many others are able to take advantage of one or the other of the numerous
tax exemption schemes that have been introduced in the last few decades. To reduce the burden
of taxes and reinvigorate the business environment, the government has recently submitted a draft
tax law to Parliament in which it proposes to cut marginal corporate and personal income tax
rates to 20 percent, streamline exemption rules so as to reduce tax avoidance and create a more
level playing field for different types of business ventures, increase the penalties for tax evasion,
and strengthen the institutional capacity of the Tax Department in order to improve tax collection
while minimizing arbitrary and unpredictable treatment of taxpayers.
25. Other investment climate considerations. The government is currently working on a
detailed program for fast tracking and streamlining of bureaucratic procedures for investments
with the aim of upgrading the business environment and introducing further deregulation. Recent
actions towards this end include: restructuring of the leadership and management of GAFI,
establishing a Board of Trustees to clarify its mission and mandate, establishing a Board of
Directors with a majority of private sector members to provide a better link with business
developments and needs, and specifying a plan to shift GAFI’s priorities from regulation to
investment promotion and investor advocacy; and opening a “one-stop shop” to handle foreign
and domestic investment registration and information needs. The government has also started to
offer business support services such as licensing and building permits, customs and tax
information via the Internet on a limited basis. There is considerable scope to enhance such “egovernment” programs that can help to reduce processing time and transaction costs.
Enhancing Provision of Public Services
26. Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Recent macroeconomic performance suggests that
while Government has kept inflation and interest rates low on average, it has not been able to
keep fiscal deficits and the public debt from rising to levels that could jeopardize long run
sustainability. The Government recognizes the importance of controlling the fiscal deficit and has
plans to reduce the deficit over the medium run through both restraining public expenditures and
increasing public revenues. Towards these ends, there are plans to redesign subsidies, control the
growth of public sector employment, cut unnecessary or “luxury” expenditures in government
departments, rationalize tax exemptions, and improve the performance of the tax collections
department. Some actions have already been taken in this regard. For example, the subsidy on
diesel fuel and electricity has been reduced in recent months.5 Also, as already noted, a new tax
law has been proposed that should help improve tax collections in the medium run. Government
expects that the reduction of corporate tax rates and the restructuring of tax administration
procedures that are part of its reform program will lead to higher tax collections within three
years of implementation due to increased business activity, a broader tax base, fewer exemptions,
and lower rates of evasion. Increased business activity is also expected from the reforms being
pursued with respect to the investment climate. This too should help increase the revenue to GDP
5

Prices of selected grades of diesel and gasoline have been adjusted upwards at least twice over the last
twelve months. There are plans as well to increase electricity rates by 5% per annum over the next five
years.

8

ratio over time. However, during the next two years, Government expects the fiscal deficit and
public debt to increase for two reasons: to finance much-needed public investments to facilitate a
private sector response to the structural reforms being undertaken and to reflect an initial period
of declining revenues as tax and tariff rates are cut.
27. The pace and sequencing of various fiscal actions noted above need to be analyzed further
to ensure that macroeconomic stability is preserved as the reform program proceeds. In particular,
the funds needed for the resolution of the NPL problem in the banking sector will impose a
substantial strain on the fiscal accounts and the public debt. To alleviate this pressure in a
credible manner it may be necessary to move more aggressively on certain items of current
expenditure such as subsidies. Attention will also need to be paid to strengthening treasury
functions within the budgetary system so as to improve transparency and reduce total borrowing
needs. Finally, more attention will need to be paid to contingent liabilities that may reside in the
pensions system.
28. Enhancing public investments. As already noted, there has been a significant reduction in
the rate of public investment in recent years. While this reduction has helped restrain an even
larger increase in the fiscal deficit, it may have compromised the infrastructure base on which
private sector investment relies. Since the success of the ongoing reform program depends to a
large extent on the investment supply response of the private sector, Government plans to
facilitate a positive response by changing some key policy parameters as well as by making
strategic infrastructure investments in areas such as electricity generation and transport, for
example, and supporting more competitive provision of telecommunications services.
29. A key aspect of Government’s strategy is to increase the involvement of the private sector
in public infrastructure investments. Relevant options include variants of build-ownoperate/transfer arrangements. Government is presently discussing ways to make such
arrangements commercially attractive for the private sector and has sought technical assistance
from various sources. Discussions focus on elimination of certain restrictions on private sector
participation, setting quality standards for participation, and establishing clear legal rules for the
selection of investors through transparent and competitive procedures. At the same time,
Government is conscious of the need to ensure that the resulting arrangements do not create
private monopolies and that they are embedded within a regulatory and supervisory framework
that protects the public interest, especially in such services as utilities or public transportation. It
is expected that public-private partnerships will be sought most actively in such sectors as
transportation, telecommunications, tourism and real estate development. In the case of
telecommunications infrastructure, the government has taken a number of measures to improve
access and quality of service, including support for competitive Internet service provision (the
sector is private sector-driven and about 180 Internet Service Providers are now active); a
broadband initiative (2003); incentives to increase diffusion of personal computers; and the
establishment of a universal (telecommunications) service fund. However, the challenge of
improving rural access remains.
30. Improving water resource management. Egypt has about 950 cubic meters per year per
capita of water resources, lower than the MENA average of 1,200 cubic meters. Growing
urbanization and the expansion of agriculture to formerly desert lands has increased the
competition for the relatively fixed supply of river and ground water while putting pressure as
well on the quality of these water resources. Water quality is declining, especially in the Delta,
due to insufficiently treated industrial and municipal discharges, inadequate sanitation coverage
in rural areas and heavily-polluted drainage canals. In certain areas, groundwater and shallow
water aquifers are severely contaminated. In addition, there are concerns about supply/demand
imbalances for the future, weaknesses in service delivery, reliability and transparency, and the
fiscal/financial sustainability of current arrangements. The Government recognizes that top

9

priority must be given to improving water resource management and has sought technical
assistance on appropriate sector policies and practices. Among the key objectives of its evolving
water management strategy are: expanding the water network coverage in urban and rural areas
through an accelerated investment program and improvement in service delivery; rationalizing
water consumption for both municipal and agriculture demands (through improving the fee
collection system, minimizing illegal leakages from water networks, expanding metering systems
and increasing public awareness about water conservation); and reducing water pollution (for
example, through projects aimed at preventing wastewater seeping into groundwater, diverting
potable water networks from areas relying on sanitary trenches, and improving agricultural
drainage). There is a regional dimension to the management of water resources as well,
necessitated by the fact that Egypt depends almost entirely on the Nile for its water and the Nile is
shared by nine other riparian states (see Box 1).
31. Improving air quality. Egypt suffers from poor air quality due to practices such as the
burning of agricultural residues, an aged stock of automobiles, and certain industrial activities. A
recent assessment showed that the annual damage from air pollution is about LE 6.4 billion (2.1
percent of GDP in 1999) and is reflected largely in premature mortality and morbidity. Local
damage costs due to the burning of agricultural residues were approximately LE 700 million
(US$150 million in 1999/2000). In the absence of remedial measures, further economic activity
will lead to an increase in damage costs of almost 25 percent by 2010. In this regard, the
reduction of subsidies on gasoline and electricity in recent months should help tilt incentives in
favor of more efficient energy consumption. Other actions being considered include: (a) reducing
concentration of pollutants in the transport and agricultural residues sectors; (b) increasing the
share of natural gas in the industrial sectors (with emphasis on small-and-medium industry) and
in the transport sector particularly for city buses and micro buses; (c) using the Clean
Development Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol to increase revenues from the trading of
certified emission credits; and (d) disseminating information to the public on air pollution and its
health risks.
32. Supporting growth through better education and training. Government attaches high
priority to strengthening the country’s educational system. While much has been achieved in the
last two decades, it is recognized that much more needs to be done to equip Egyptians adequately
for the twenty-first century and to build an “information society” or “knowledge economy” in the
country.6 Towards this end, Government intends to pursue a strategy aimed at: improving the
quality of education at all levels, including pre-schools (through developing and maintaining
national standards and strengthening monitoring, accreditation and quality assurance processes);
making curricula at various stages more relevant to the needs of domestic and international labor
markets (and thereby enhancing the employability of graduates); decentralizing the locus of
decision making to schools and communities as appropriate (so as to increase local and parental
ownership of the educational process, improve accountability of teaching staff, and enhance
quality); improving access to quality education services to currently disadvantaged populations in
Upper Egypt and poor urban areas, including working children and disabled; and improving the
performance of training institutes (in part through linking them better with private sector sources
of demand). Such a program will also require improving access of schools to information
infrastructure (connectivity) at reasonable cost.

6

The foundations of the knowledge economy will be strengthened not only by initiatives in education but
also by measures related to private sector development, especially those that facilitate ICT and financial
sector reform. Such measures should help build a more dynamic information and innovation infrastructure.

10

Box 1: Egypt and the Nile Basin Initiative
Egypt is the most downstream of the 10 riparian states of the River Nile. Except along the Mediterranean
coast and the Sinai, rainfall over most of Egypt is close to zero and, although there are some non-renewable
groundwater resources, surface water resources outside the Nile Basin are extremely limited. So Egypt is
totally dependent on the flows of the Nile, which account for 96-98 percent of the country’s renewable
freshwater resources and provides for 95 percent of the country’s population, who live within a narrow strip
along its banks.
With populations and water demand growing among all riparian states, the future management of Nile
waters is a major challenge, best met through cooperative efforts to optimize river flows and food and
power production, reduce drought and flood shocks and water losses, and ensure a water-secure future for
all. Until recently, there was no inclusive mechanism to address this challenge; instead there has been a
long history of dispute over Nile waters. The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) set out to change that in 1999.
The NBI has made considerable progress since 1999. A basin-wide program of projects is under
implementation, with the objective of building trust and capacity and laying the foundation for joint
investment. The NBI is now pursuing a joint multi-track investment strategy at the sub-basin level,
involving: (i) investments responding to urgent needs on the ground through irrigation and fishery
development, watershed management, flood preparedness, and power interconnection; and (ii) longer term
large scale investments in hydropower, flood control, river regulation and environmental management that
address comprehensive and integrated basin development. Egypt is playing an active role in all of the
basin-wide and sub-basin programs.
With 85 percent of the Nile flow into Egypt coming from Ethiopia through Sudan into Egypt, there are
major opportunities in the ‘Eastern Nile’ for joint development. A recent agreement among the Eastern
Nile states promises to facilitate such outcomes as improved river regulation and flow, efficient use of
water for productive purposes, access to new energy sources (Egypt plans to add 1000 MW of electricity
every year), and better flood control and reduced sedimentation.
The potential for meeting Egypt’s grain and meat demand from within the basin is being actively pursued,
an approach that will be greatly facilitated by Egypt’s offer to share its successful experience in irrigated
agriculture and marketing. This will lead to the Egyptian private sector exploring opportunities for
cooperative investments with private sector entities in other basin countries, with some partnerships already
emerging – for instance, in the manufacture of pipes and the establishment of abattoirs in Ethiopia.
The regional agenda may slow Egypt’s own plans in the short run; however, continued positive
engagement with the NBI should lead to significant economic and political benefits, along with a
potentially accelerated program, in the medium term. Gaining broader stakeholder understanding through
civil society discourse and commitment at the highest political levels for the NBI is important.

33. Some characteristics of education financing in Egypt present a special problem. Most of the
education budget is directed towards salaries of teachers and other administrative staff, leaving
very little for other areas such as investment or maintenance and other recurrent cost items. There
are 1.2 million employees in the education sector of which 800,000 are teachers while the rest are
non-teaching staff. All are paid low salaries to the extent that quality cannot be easily improved
without revising compensation levels, an issue that is common to other government services as
well. Recognizing this problem, Government intends to: (a) use the current budget more costeffectively through reallocation of resources among different items. For example, savings can be
derived from using textbooks over multiple years or from making changes in the design
specifications of school buildings. These savings could then be directed to better maintenance of
schools, more opportunities for teacher training and the payment of incentives to good teachers;

11

and (b) encourage community participation and the establishment of private schools and
universities. The private sector presently accounts for only 7 percent of enrollees in preuniversity education (except at the pre-school level where there is a greater share of the private
sector). This needs to be increased threefold in order to reduce the pressure on the Government
budget for education. Provided they follow prescribed national standards, private schools and
universities can help improve the quality and market relevance of education as well.
34. There is broad agreement between Government and the World Bank on key objectives and
programs in education. Many of the areas of focus of the Ministry of Education are those that the
Bank is supporting through its ongoing projects and sector dialogue. For example, the
Government’s recent move to increase access to and improve quality of preschools is supported
by the World Bank and several other donors through the recently approved Early Childhood
Education Enhancement Project. The Bank also supports the efforts of the Ministries of Finance
and Education to review public expenditures in the education sector in order to identify areas of
inefficiencies and waste. The implementation of the recommendations emerging from the
ongoing PER exercise should help the MOE in reallocating resources towards cost-effective
approaches, which in turn would help improve schooling quality. One area where the Bank would
propose greater focus is increased collaboration and harmonization among donors supporting the
education sector.
35. Improving quality and efficiency of health services. Demands on the government health
system are rising as a result of demographic and epidemiologic transition. The increasing burden
of chronic and geriatric diseases, the need to provide a more equitable distribution of health care
to low-income people and people living in rural and frontier areas, and the demand for higher
quality and better service, are already straining public resources. The Government recognizes the
need to (a) improve the quality and efficiency of the existing government health care delivery
system by reducing fragmentation, introducing greater managerial autonomy and accountability,
and contracting of services where appropriate; (b) place greater emphasis on prevention and
primary care; and (c) enhance management of public funds, including the Health Insurance
Organization, through the introduction of modern information systems and management
practices.
36. Fostering greater accountability in the public and private sectors. Government plans to
improve the performance of public sector agencies through strengthening their governance and
management structure. This could include introducing performance monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) frameworks, ensuring regular performance evaluations for senior management,
developing sound and unified accounting rules for the treatment of profits among state-owned
enterprises, improving the information databases used by public sector units for their investment
and service delivery objectives, and requiring a higher level of information disclosure to the
public on service delivery targets and achievements through such means as publishing the
minutes of key meetings on official websites (such as the Investment Portal). Implementing these
ideas in key sectors such as health and education services should be given high priority.
Government also recognizes the importance of good corporate governance in the private sector.
Towards this end, it has set up an Institute of Directors whose mandate is to strengthen corporate
governance practices, provide research and technical advisory services to enhance compliance
with laws and regulations and promote awareness of benefits of good corporate governance. The
mandate of the Institute has recently been widened to go beyond listed companies to encompass
all companies registered under GAFI.
37. Addressing urban challenges. Cities in Egypt have been suffering from low municipal
capacity, poor urban planning, inadequate land and housing policies, low levels of local
investment in basic infrastructure relative to needs, and deteriorating environmental conditions in
several areas. The National Democratic Party’s report, “Preservation of Agricultural Lands and

12

Management of Urban Development in Egypt” (September 2004), defines Egypt’s major urban
challenges in the coming 20 years as: a) preserving scarce arable land from informal urbanization;
b) upgrading 1105 squatter and slum settlements in Egypt, in which some 15.7 million inhabitants
now live; and c) enhancing service delivery capacity to accommodate an expected increase of 26
million in Egypt’s population by 2020. These challenges are complex and underscore the need
for innovative approaches and solutions, including partnerships with the private sector. Egypt’s
cities and metropolitan governments represent the institutional counterparts for private sector
investors, and their ability to form effective partnerships hinges critically on the quality and
efficiency of the services they are able to offer. Over the past two years, Government has
successfully piloted the City Development Strategy (CDS) in Alexandria. It is now ready to
mainstream this as a preferred approach to strategic planning by making it mandatory for other
governorates.
38. Improving government services. Since the public sector has a substantial and pervasive
presence in the Egyptian economy, the quality of development in the country is substantially
affected by the quality of human resources in the public sector, the organizational framework
within which public services are delivered, and the costs of maintaining the current size of the
civil service.7 Government is fully cognizant of the centrality of civil service reform to long term
growth in Egypt. However, mindful of political sensitivities, it prefers to deal with the problem
in a piecemeal and gradual fashion. At the moment, its approach encompasses ideas for
outsourcing some civil service functions (such as building maintenance), limiting new hires,
exploring the possibility of part-time and short-term contracts for new hires rather than offering
them lifetime employment as has been the norm so far, introducing better performance
monitoring systems, and allowing greater flexibility to local administrations with respect to
deployment of civil servants. Under the aegis of the Organizational Development Initiative,
Government proposes to: assess the functions of different government agencies in relation to
their mandates; assess the scope for decentralization of selected functions; strengthen institutional
capacity building among municipalities and governorates so as to enable them to carry out
decentralized assignments effectively; and encourage civil society to be more involved in the
selection, design, implementation and monitoring of certain public services. Furthermore,
Government is open to adopting new methods of service delivery where possible as shown by the
case of the CDS noted above.
39. Redesigning social policy. Social policy also has a part to play in achieving a diversified
and competitive economy that generates growth and new jobs. Egypt already possesses several
components of a social protection system that can play such a growth-facilitating role. However,
these components may have to be redesigned so as to make them more effective and compatible
with the needs of an economy that will be functioning in a more competitive world. Critical areas
in this regard are: the social insurance system (including health insurance) which needs to be
made financially sustainable; training and skill development programs that need to be properly
aligned with market demands; and labor market regulations that need to ensure a better balance
between the rights of workers and the need for adequate flexibility for enterprises to adjust
workforce levels and compensation. With regard to the last mentioned point, a new Labor Law
was enacted in 2003 whose implementation should help Egypt move towards the necessary
balance. Finally, safety nets for the poor are also an important aspect of social policy in Egypt
and a prominent instrument to promote equity as discussed in the next section.

7

Analytical work suggests that government consumption, in part reflecting expenditures on the civil
service, has a negative impact on growth in Egypt. At present, expenditures on wages and salaries absorb a
significant chunk (31%) of current expenditures. This is because the civil service is large relative to the
size of the economy (5.5 million people and approximately 29% of the labor force).

13

Promoting Equity
40. Strengthening safety nets. Helping the poor is an important collective preference in
Egyptian society and there exist both private and public social safety nets to support those who
are unable to earn adequate incomes. The public safety nets presently consist of subsidy
programs (such as for food and energy), public employment programs (such as those operated
under the Social Fund for Development) and cash transfer programs (such as those managed by
the Ministry of Social Affairs and Insurance). Government is keenly aware that concerns exist
about the effectiveness and efficiency of some safety net programs. In recent months, it has
begun to place special emphasis on the need to redesign safety net programs with a view to
improving their efficiency and facilitating the social adjustment to the ongoing reforms, thereby
making the reforms themselves more sustainable. A dialogue on relevant issues and sharing of
international experience occurred in Luxor, Egypt in February 2005. This dialogue was
facilitated by the World Bank and involved relevant members of the Egyptian Cabinet (led by the
Prime Minister) and counterparts/experts from Mexico and Brazil. Following this meeting, GOE
organized a Social Reform policy group within the Cabinet that is charged with assessing various
reform options with a view to presenting recommendations for action.
41. Improving access to health care. Health is an important dimension of national welfare. In
Egypt, all employees (and their families) in the public sector, as well as in certain private
companies, are entitled to (partial) health insurance. However, those who are self-employed, or
working in informal private sector enterprises, do not have employment-based health insurance
coverage and must rely for support on public or private safety nets. 37 percent of Egyptian
households from the lowest wealth quintile are reported to have no access to insurance, compared
to 15 percent of the highest quintile. Providing access to quality health care for a broad segment
of the population, especially the less well-off, and doing so in a cost-effective manner, is an
important objective of public policy in Egypt. Towards this end, Government plans to reform the
health insurance system and find ways to extend coverage to those not presently covered. It also
plans to devote more resources to primary health care programs, strengthen the administration of
the public health system, improve the public health information system, and expand the
participation of NGOs and local communities in the planning and delivery of health services.
42. Decreasing interregional disparities. Upper Egypt, and in particular rural Upper Egypt,
has the highest incidence of poverty in the country: 34 percent of the people there are poor and
half of all poor Egyptians live there. In addition, while poverty fell between 1995/96 and
1999/2000 for the rest of Egypt, it increased in rural Upper Egypt, suggesting that the region is
not well linked to the mainstream of the economy. Government is mindful of the special
developmental challenges of Upper Egypt, and has been diverting a rising share of public
expenditures to that region (from 19 percent in the fourth Five Year Plan to 25 percent in the fifth
Five Year Plan). Additional public resources are needed, not only to reduce disparities in access
to services and public infrastructure, but also to better support income generating activities. In
Upper Egypt, the poorest (lowest two quintiles) comprise agricultural laborers, landless farmers,
as well as farmers with very small landholdings (less than one feddan). Specific activities to
promote agricultural productivity and growth, as well as develop non-farm rural economic
opportunities, will be required.
43. Decentralizing public service delivery. At present, most public services in Egypt are
delivered by central ministries operating through their own (de-concentrated) local staff. Budget
and administrative control is exercised by ministries or by appointed Governors who head local
administrations. This level of centralization is not necessarily compatible with the optimal choice
and efficient delivery of local priorities. Using community organizations and NGOs to define
public service needs and to monitor delivery can be particularly useful and cost-effective for rural
development purposes, for improving the poverty-reducing impact of social funds, and for

14

delivering health and education services. Even within the present system, however, there are
opportunities for expanding local initiative. Some local administrations have negotiated the
bureaucratic and legal space to tackle local development issues in a more flexible manner. For
example, in Qena governorate, health care workers can draw supplemental income from funds
generated by co-payments on health services imposed under the authority of the local Executive
Council, leading to improved morale and better staffing and utilization of health care facilities.
Furthermore, measures to promote fiscal (expenditure and revenue) decentralization are under
consideration. Finally, the authorities have launched an E-Government initiative that should also
help achieve significant decentralization of some public services. The program has so far been
implemented on a pilot basis, involving selected urban and rural administrative districts. The task
ahead is to improve monitoring and evaluation and, on that basis, scale up successful models.
B. Medium-term Macroeconomic Prospects
Base Case
44. In the base case scenario, Egypt should experience growth of 5 percent on average
during FY06-09. This scenario is based on three key points. First, the economy is already
growing at close to 5 percent (provisional estimate for FY05) and the momentum from this
should carry over into subsequent years. Second, external demand is likely to stay broadly
favorable. Third, a raft of domestic policy reforms have been initiated, boosting the credibility of
the economic management of the present Government. There is much confidence that the
announced reforms will be successfully implemented and new ones will be initiated. However,
concerns remain about the fiscal position and the impact of rising international interest rates.
45. Present growth momentum. An economic growth rate of 4.8 percent has been recorded in
the first half of FY05 (up from 4.2 percent the year before). This is expected to accelerate in the
second half, based on current trends in investment and exports. Total export earnings have grown
by 34 percent in the first half of FY05 while total investments have grown by 10.5 percent (in
nominal terms). Business community expectations are positive as well, as revealed by the
“Business Barometer” put out by the Egyptian Center for Economic Studies in January 2005.
Respondents to this semi-annual survey anticipate an increase in output and sales, and are
guardedly optimistic as well about short term employment and investment growth.
46. Prospects for external demand. External developments are likely to stay favorable with
respect to world economic demand and oil prices.8 Over the CAS period, world economic growth
rates are likely to exceed the average that has prevailed over the last five years. Prospects for
higher exports of oil and gas (and for higher FDI in those sectors) and for higher tourism flows
are particularly favorable. Expanding world economic demand and trading opportunities available
under various trade agreements should raise Egypt’s merchandise exports. Oil prices are likely to
stay high in the short run before declining to around $30 for the medium term. This should
strengthen Egypt’s balance of payments and fiscal position since the country is a (small) net
exporter.
47. Rising international interest rates. Domestic interest rates have declined recently due to
excess liquidity in the banking system and high inflow of foreign funds seeking to exploit the gap
between domestic and foreign interest rates. However, this situation is not expected to last much
longer. World interest rates are likely to be higher over the next few years, with the six month
LIBOR rising from 1.6 percent in 2004 to an average of 4.1 percent in 2005-06. As world
interest rates rise, there will be pressure on domestic interest rates to rise in Egypt.

8

A strong link exists between the GDP growth rates of Egypt and OECD countries over the last 15 years.
The simple correlation between these two variables for the period 1988-2003 is 0.70.

15

48. Fiscal position. The ratio of the consolidated fiscal deficit to GDP is expected to rise in
FY06-08 due to higher spending on debt servicing and lower revenues from trade and income tax
rate reductions. After that it should decline as growth continues at 5 percent and tax collections
begin to increase as a result of tax administration improvements. The net public debt ratio is
expected to decline modestly over the CAS period under base case assumptions. However, it
should be noted that the high level of the deficit and the public debt limits the room for maneuver
and makes the economy more vulnerable to interest rate and other shocks.

Alternative scenarios
49. External or domestic shocks could cause growth to drop from one to two percentage points
below the base case scenario. Two types of adverse developments (or their combination) could
trigger lower growth. First, unfavorable exogenous shocks such as lower OECD growth, a sharp
spike in world interest rates, or an adverse regional geopolitical event (such as a terrorist attack)
could occur. These would affect growth through reducing foreign demand or domestic supply or
both, depending on their nature and duration. The economy’s resilience would partly depend on
the quality of the policy response, and partly on the soundness of the financial system and
investment climate. Second, a slowdown of reform efforts, in particular a failure to strengthen the
financial system and improve the investment climate as needed in the face of stiffer international
competition, would put at risk the sustainability of growth in the 5 percent range and most likely
lead to lower private investment (including foreign direct investment) and higher unemployment.
Simulations of two macroeconomic scenarios – “External Shock” and “Policy Shock” – described
in Annex 5, show that both types of developments will likely reduce the investment rate in Egypt
by up to 6 percentage points of GDP in the medium term. In this context, Egypt will face
difficulties in meeting its financing needs.
III. EGYPT-WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP FOR FY06-09
A. Implementation of Previous CAS
50. The World Bank Board discussed the previous CAS for Egypt in June, 2001. Over the next
three years (FY02-04), the scenario that prevailed came closer to the low case than the base case
that was outlined in the CAS. Policy reforms slowed, the fiscal deficit continued to rise, and
lending declined.
51. Slowdown of policy reforms. The CAS period saw a lack of forward movement in several
areas of reform including trade, foreign exchange management, finance, and privatization. Some

16

actions were taken but in a manner and at a pace that reduced the likelihood of a timely positive
impact. For example, a free trade agreement was signed with the European Union after several
years of negotiation but key liberalization measures within this agreement were loaded into the
outer years. In the meantime, the tariff system remained relatively complicated (with 27 bands)
and an impediment to trade (with an average tariff level of 15 percent or so). The exchange rate
was floated in January 2003 but an ad hoc system of administrative guidance was imposed on the
key foreign exchange market players quickly thereafter. The parallel market did not disappear for
the next eighteen months or so. While a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) exercise
was undertaken, little effort was made to implement its main recommendations though some
progress was made through the issuance of new laws and regulations pertaining to capital
requirements, banking supervision, credit concentration, and connected lending.9 Finally, the
speed of privatization slowed down relative to the vigorous pace set a few years earlier.
52. For the Bank, while the dialogue over structural reforms remained inconclusive, that
pertaining to other issues, such as poverty, gender and education, improved substantially. During
the CAS period the Bank and the Government collaborated on several pieces of analytical work
that led to both a better and a shared understanding in such areas as poverty trends, gender
achievements, and education sector needs. The spirit that marked this collaborative effort bodes
well for the future as the shared understanding feeds into policy and project design and leads to
faster implementation.
53. Deterioration of fiscal performance. The CAS period also saw the continuation of a rise in
the fiscal deficit. During FY02-04, the consolidated public sector deficit increased from 2.5
percent of GDP to 2.7 percent. The quality of the deficit continued to worsen in the sense that
capital expenditures declined from 4.0 percent of GDP to 3.7 percent while current expenditures
(including civil service salaries, subsidies and debt service payments) continued to rise (from 22.6
percent of GDP to 23.2 percent) and revenue performance deteriorated from 27.5 percent of GDP
to 26.8 percent.
54. Decline in lending. The above developments were associated with a decline in Bank
lending. Two rounds of discussion regarding a possible policy-based loan for Egypt failed to
produce an agreement, partly because the adverse economic impact from such external events as
the attacks of September 11 (in 2001) and the war in Iraq (in 2003) was smaller than anticipated,
thereby reducing the urgency and need for external assistance, and partly for lack of timely action
on selected trade, tax and financial sector measures. The lending pipeline, already in decline by
2000, registered commitment levels of 0, 50, and 12.4 million dollars respectively during FY01,
FY02 and FY03. However, the last year of the CAS period, FY04, saw a substantial surge in
lending (to $340.6 million) due to a large loan for a new airport terminal.
55. Improvement in portfolio performance. Despite the overall decline in the quantity of
lending, the quality of the outstanding portfolio improved over the CAS period. At the end of
FY02, five of the Bank’s 18 projects were in problem status, with a very low disbursement ratio
(about 7 percent). Egypt was on the Bank-wide watch list for countries with commitments at risk
above 33 percent. Today, there are only two problem projects, with commitment at risk of around
2 percent, and a disbursement ratio of over 18 percent. Improvements have been achieved through
increased efforts to build implementation capacity, restructure projects, cancel unutilized
amounts, and even close some projects (e.g., PBDAC project was closed in December 2003.)
Project effectiveness delays have been markedly reduced. In FY03-04 effectiveness delays ranged
between 3 and 7 months with an average of about 4 months, compared to an average of 14
9

Another achievement following the FSAP was the fulfillment of all legal and institutional requirements
in accordance with the FATF recommendations and measures. This resulted in the removal of Egypt from
the list of non-cooperating countries and territories in February 2004.

17

months in the two years prior to that. Effectiveness was speeded up by enhanced collaboration
with the Ministry of International Cooperation and diligent intervention of the line ministry
concerned at each and every step of the process mandated in Egypt for aid-supported projects.
Project implementation was successfully improved through dedicated, proactive support to the
procurement and disbursement process at the project level by the Country Department. As of July
31, 2004, the Bank had approved 110 projects for Egypt, valued at about $7 billion, of which
about $4.5 billion had been disbursed. The current active portfolio has 18 projects (including the
recently effective Airports Project) with a commitment value of about $1.025 billion.
56. Selected lessons of previous CAS. The implementation of the previous CAS unfolded
differently from initial expectations and the Bank made several strategic and tactical choices
some of which are of relevance to the design of the new CAS program. First, as Egypt graduated
from IDA in 1999, the Government’s approach to borrowing changed. This was indeed
recognized in the previous CAS which emphasized that IBRD projects would need to be
packaged together with donor grants to meet Government requirements for a 40 percent grant
element. During CAS implementation, it became clearer that coordinated approval and
implementation in the context of differing donor project processing and approval cycles resulted
in longer preparation periods and higher processing costs. Several loans have in fact occurred but
a year or two later than projected in the CAS. To the extent that the Government remains
interested in minimizing the cost of funding for donor-supported projects, the Bank will need to
factor in the need for more timely consultations with likely grant-making partners so as to contain
project processing times and costs.
57. Second, the previous CAS had assumed that structural reforms in Egypt would occur in the
context of Bank policy-based lending. It became apparent during CAS implementation that while
the Government valued the Bank’s knowledge in designing structural reform measures it did not
necessarily want to implement these measures when these were specified as part of the
conditionality associated with a policy based loan. Eventually, many of the measures (e.g.
exchange rate reform, tariff restructuring and rationalization of tax rates) discussed during the
preparation of the policy based loan were implemented as part of the Government’s reform
program and have resulted in Egypt beginning this CAS in a strong base case scenario. Lessons
from this experience have been incorporated into this CAS being designed in a holistic manner
(as described in paragraph 64).
58. Third, the previous CAS had attempted to focus the Bank’s lending assistance on areas
where Government’s commitment was clear. Despite these efforts, some projects were dropped
and others cancelled without significant disbursement. Two major changes have occurred in the
design of this CAS which should considerably reduce this risk for the future. First, Government
has designated lead donors in relevant sectors, thus making it easier to determine where the
Bank’s own efforts should be focused and with whom to conduct discussions regarding
coordination and harmonization of efforts. Second, specific activities included in this CAS have
been validated with the Government and it has been agreed with the authorities that project
preparation would not commence in earnest before the authorities pre-approve the Bank loan
amount. Such a pre-approval would reduce the likelihood of projects being dropped after
significant preparation has been undertaken and would reduce the time needed for ratification and
effectiveness upon Board approval.

59.

Finally, the previous CAS had focused the Bank’s non-lending assistance on discrete
deliverables with a limited time horizon. During CAS implementation, the Government’s interest
was in a more sustained and lengthy process of engagement (e.g. in poverty analysis and strategy
design). Non-lending support during the upcoming CAS will therefore increasingly focus on a
long-term programmatic engagement with focused outputs (e.g. the Public Expenditure and
Fiduciary Management work or the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis).

18

B. Salient Aspects of Proposed CAS
60. The political and economic context for the present CAS is very different from that
prevailing at the time the last CAS was prepared. The earlier CAS was introduced at a time when
economic growth was slowing and the political will to pursue reforms appeared to be waning.
The current context features both a revival of growth and of interest in reforms. There now exists
a remarkable opportunity for the Bank Group and other development partners to harness their
financial and technical support for Egypt to an improving economy bolstered by a credible reform
program.
Results Framework
61. The content and expected outcomes of the CAS have been expressed in a Results
Framework (attached as Annex 1). Starting with the overarching objective of achieving growth
with equity the Framework identifies three intermediate strategic objectives based on discussions
with Government and consultations with other stakeholders. These strategic objectives are: (a)
facilitating private sector development; (b) enhancing the provision of selected public goods and
(c) promoting equity. These objectives are further disaggregated into a set of 13 outcomes that the
Bank expects to influence through the CAS as well as a larger set of intermediate outcomes that
can be monitored to track progress towards the achievement of the CAS outcomes. The
framework also identifies various financial and advisory interventions by the Bank Group that are
intended to contribute towards the achievement of these outcomes.
62. The Results Framework is intended to be flexible in application. It provides an initial sense
of strategic direction for Bank assistance but should be thought of as remaining open for change if
evolving Government priorities and external developments so warrant. While a list of proposed
Bank financial and analytical support activities is provided for the next four years, this is intended
to be tentative, especially for the outer years. The choice of certain analytic activities reinforces
the intention to stay flexible. For example, we anticipate providing analytic assistance to evaluate
public expenditure priorities and to examine the poverty and social impact of various reforms.
However, the exact content of activities in these two categories will be determined each year in
consultation with the Government.
63. The Results Framework is also intended to be a monitoring tool. The scope of monitoring
will cover the 13 outcomes shown in Annex 1. The frequency of monitoring will be once a year.
The mechanisms will be as follows: for macroeconomic and related outcomes the relevant
monitoring data will be obtained from the key economic ministries, while for sectoral outcomes
relevant data will be obtained through project supervision missions. These data will feed into the
CAS Progress Report scheduled for FY08 and the CAS Completion Report scheduled for FY10.
64. The CAS approaches the link between Bank instruments and the achievement of reforms in
a holistic fashion. The Bank has an understanding with Government whereby financial assistance
will be concentrated in a limited number of high-priority sectors and projects while analytic and
advisory work will be expanded in scope and content to incorporate a broader range of reform
issues and measures. It is expected that the current reform momentum will continue and will not
necessarily be linked to individual projects. Dialogue and action on reforms will be the objective
of the total program of assistance provided by the Bank rather than mostly that of the financial
assistance component of it.
Consultations with stakeholders
65. In the course of preparing the CAS, consultations were held with government officials as
well as with representatives of the private sector and of civil society (including women’s groups).
Specific events included: (a) several meetings with key Ministers, both on a one-on-one basis and

19

in groups; (b) two workshops with civil society groups and one with the private sector; and (c) a
meeting with local government officials and NGOs in a governorate in Upper Egypt.
66. These consultations validated the importance of the goal of achieving growth with equity in
Egypt and provided support for the specific framework suggested for the CAS, namely, the three
strategic objectives discussed in Section IIA above. As might be expected, support for the first
two objectives (private sector development and provision of public services) was strongest within
the private sector while support for the third pillar (promoting equity) was strongest among
representatives of civil society. Consultations at the sub-national level proved useful in providing
an appreciation of the scope for decentralizing the delivery of public services in Egypt.
Evidently, much can be done in a decentralized manner without necessarily changing the formal
political structures that govern center-local relations in the country.
Coordination with Development Partners
67. Owing to its size, strategic location, and geopolitical position, Cairo houses an extensive
presence of representatives of bilateral, Arab regional, multilateral, and UN agencies. The Donor
Assistance Group (DAG) is the main formal vehicle for the exchange of information and
coordination of efforts among donors, and serves, to a lesser extent, as a coordinator between
donors and the Government. The DAG meets on monthly basis in Cairo at the level of heads of
development assistance departments (for bilaterals) and heads of agencies or operations (for
development institutions). Numerous DAG specialized subgroups were formed on topics such as
health, education, private sector development, gender, poverty, governance and water resource
management. Those subgroups meet on a regular basis to facilitate technical consultations among
specialized staff. Frequent consultations by the Bank with donor representatives in Cairo have
been critical to ensure effective collaboration with them. Such efforts have allowed the Bank to
mobilize financial support from other donors for many ESW activities and for almost every
project in the current portfolio (notably collaboration with EC in human development projects,
with KfW in water and irrigation projects, and IFAD in rural development projects).
68. The main donors in terms of financial transfers continue to be the USAID and the EC.
USAID programs in Egypt are increasingly supporting efforts in the education, governance
(democracy), and financial sector domains as compared to ongoing programs in the water,
environment, and large infrastructure domains and annual ODA is expected to gradually come
down to approximately $400 million. EC assistance for Egypt is expected to support efforts in the
water, governance, and innovation and R&D domains during the current MEDA program that is
expected to end in 2006. Additional EC resources, possibly twice as large as those currently
available, are expected to be negotiated under the aegis of the new European Neighborhood
Policy. More recently, the AfDB announced that it plans to significantly enhance its support to
Egypt with emphasis on power generation, financial reforms and transport.
69. As noted above, cooperation with development partners has been close and effective in
recent years. There is every likelihood that this state of affairs will continue both because of the
degree of goodwill that exists and because of the overlap in future areas of interest. For example,
both the EU and USAID propose to support Government efforts towards improving the
environment for private sector development and, in particular, reforming and restructuring the
financial sector. These are focal areas for the Bank Group as well and we expect to see both
upstream cooperation in analytical work and downstream collaboration in project
implementation. In this connection, a Financial Sector Donors Sub-group has been formed to
coordinate efforts and ensure complementarity in both technical and financial support provided to
the government. One outcome of this group is the joint World Bank-EU project for modernizing
the payments system at the CBE. Similarly, we expect to continue to collaborate with the AfDB
through arranging parallel financing in infrastructure projects. The framework and priorities of

20

the CAS have been discussed with key development partners while strategic documents of
partners, such as the country assistance strategy of the AfDB, have been shared with the Bank.
Discussions are also expected on the EU’s Action Plan for Egypt currently being prepared under
the aegis of the new European Neighborhood Policy. Finally, greater efforts are expected to be
made in coming years to coordinate development strategies and projects with the various regional
Arab funds.
Capacity Building
70. The proposed CAS has also been designed with a stronger emphasis on capacity building to
accompany the change in the government’s role in the management of the economy. The World
Bank Institute (WBI) is expected to play an important capacity building role in support of
operations. Building on results of a baseline evaluation of WBI activities in FY03 and on a strong
partnership between WBI and country operations thanks to the location of a senior staff in the
Cairo Office, WBI activities will focus primarily on two CAS pillars, strengthening the public
sector role in implementing reform in these areas: (i) facilitating private sector development; and
(ii) enhancing the provision of selected public services.
71. Activities will be specifically targeted at Egyptian high-level officials to improve
dialogue/discuss options on key policy reforms and support implementation (see Annex 4). The
targeting of senior officials with decision making capabilities has proven effective over the past
two years in moving reform agendas. A second set of activities targeted to the “middle tier” of
officials and other stakeholders will be developed to support reform implementation and broaden
support. The in-country activities will be complemented by regional and global WBI activities.
Country Financing Parameters
72. Cost Sharing. Country Financing Parameters for Egypt (see Annex C) have been agreed
with the Government. Government shapes the development program through a comprehensive
planning process that has been in place for several decades now. While the process is driven
largely by central and local authorities, consultative mechanisms have been built into it that allow
for feedback from non-government sources as well, especially the private sector. Strong
ownership of the program is also shown by the fact that the Government finances the bulk of
development spending through its own resources and seeks bilateral and multilateral assistance
for a modest part of it. For example, public investment amounted to around $6.3 billion in FY04
while gross medium and long term external borrowing was around $1.3 billion. Egypt also
receives official grants (around $900 million in FY04) but these are not necessarily applied to
development projects.
73.
The Bank’s disbursements to Egypt have averaged around US$82 million annually over
the past four years. This is equivalent to only around 1.3 percent of public investments and about
0.1 percent of GDP. While small in overall terms, Bank finance is deployed strategically by
Government and Bank projects are well aligned with development priorities and plans. Bank
financing and expenditures on Bank-financed projects are included in the government’s budget.
Measures being taken to further assure Government commitment to projects financed by the Bank
have been outlined earlier (see paragraph 58). Project implementation performance has improved
significantly in recent years (see paragraph 55). Flexibility regarding the Bank’s financing share
in individual operations (up to 100 percent) is welcomed by the borrower and in the instances
where this is used may contribute to faster implementation. Cost sharing arrangements for future
projects would continue to be determined by individual project context with the expectation that
Government counterpart funding will be forthcoming in all or most projects. The Bank also
expects to co-finance many projects with other development partners (see paragraph 69). The
Bank’s financing share is expected to be higher in social sector and lower in infrastructure
investments.

21

74.
Recurrent Cost Financing. While high, Egypt’s fiscal deficit and public debt are
sustainable under the base case assumptions of the Bank’s lending program, namely, a 5 percent
growth rate for the economy, implementation of trade and tax reforms, and new external debt
commitments of $500 million per annum for the next four years (see Box 2 and paragraph 96).
Under these assumptions, the consolidated fiscal deficit is expected to rise to about 4.5 percent of
GDP by 2008 before beginning to decline (see Table 1 and paragraph 48) while the net public
debt is expected to rise to 89 percent of GDP before tapering off. Given the extremely modest
size of typical Bank disbursements relative to current expenditures in the budget ($82 million
versus $19 billion), it is unlikely that recurrent cost financing by the Bank per se will have a
major impact on the fiscal deficit and the public debt. Egypt continues to finance the bulk of its
recurrent cost needs from its own resources and relies on donor financing only for project-specific
reasons. The Bank’s current portfolio devotes a relatively modest share to the financing of
recurrent costs (ranging from 3 to 5 percent, mainly for project operating costs). The track record
on sustainability of Bank-financed projects has been improving. No country-level limit is
proposed on Bank financing of recurrent costs for projects in Egypt but it is expected that the
share will remain at the current modest levels. In determining the relevant share in individual
projects, the Bank would take into account sustainability issues at the sector and project levels.
75. Local Cost Financing. Rising fiscal deficits in recent years show that domestic tax and
non-tax revenues have been insufficient to meet current and capital expenditures in Egypt.
Additional funds have also been needed for the broader public investment program implemented
by state owned enterprises. In recent years, the required funds have been raised largely through
domestic debt as the Government of Egypt has followed a cautious external debt acquisition
policy. Two factors suggest that the financing profile will need to change over the coming years.
First, trade and tax reforms currently being implemented or proposed, will reduce the revenue
base somewhat for the next few years, thereby increasing the need to borrow. Second, the cost of
domestic debt is high relative to that of foreign debt and, now that the potential for depreciation is
much lower (following the significant adjustment of the exchange rate during 2003), it would be
appropriate to adjust the currency composition of the total debt. For both these reasons,
Government is likely to seek larger amounts of external financing for the development program.
The Bank would support this move. Disbursements for local expenditures have been significant
in the recent years, amounting to 74 percent, 78 percent, and 83 percent of investment lending
disbursements in FY02, FY03, and FY04 respectively. Given the experience to date and the
nature of the proposed lending program, it is expected that a significant proportion of future
disbursements will also be made against local costs. The financing of foreign costs alone would
not enable the Bank to help eligible development projects meet their objectives.
76. Taxes and duties. Tax revenues amount to about 13.7 percent of GDP in Egypt. This is
divided between income taxes (5.7 percent), sales taxes (5.4 percent) and taxes on trade (2.5
percent). The marginal income tax rate is currently 40 percent and is slated to be cut to 20
percent under a law being considered in parliament (see paragraph 24). The proposed law also
envisages measures to improve tax administration. The sales tax ranges from 5 percent to 40
percent (4 bands), with the highest rate applying to luxury goods and other items that are not
material in Bank-financed projects. Taxes on trade (customs duties) have recently been cut from
an average of 14.6 percent to 9.1 percent (see paragraph 21) and now range from 5 percent to 40
percent (6 bands) with a few higher rates for items that are also not material in Bank-financed
projects (e.g., luxury cars, cigarettes and alcoholic beverages). Bank-financed projects are taxed
at the same rates as the country’s normal rates. Given the moderate nature of the tax and duty
regime, and the further improvements in prospect, the Bank may finance all taxes and duties
associated with project costs.

22

C. Expected Outcomes of CAS and Bank Support
77. The Bank Group’s support for private sector development (as elaborated in Annex 3) is
centered around the following priorities: i) reforming the financial sector; ii) integration into
regional and global economies; iii) improving the regulatory climate for business; iv)
strengthening cooperation between the private and public sectors; v) privatization; vi) supporting
small and medium enterprises; and vii) improving the quality of infrastructure services. These
priorities have been refashioned into specific CAS outcomes listed below. The Bank, IFC, MIGA
and FIAS all have roles to play in the achievement of these outcomes and propose to use several
instruments at their disposal. For example, it is expected that, in addition to investments in
private companies, IFC will also use its technical assistance facility, PEP-MENA, to provide
support as necessary. For the Bank, analytic and advisory work independent of lending will
continue to be an important instrument.
Facilitating private sector development
78. Increased efficiency of the financial sector and greater responsiveness to the needs of the
private sector (CAS outcome 1.1). As already noted, Government has ambitious plans for
increasing the role of the private sector in the banking and insurance sectors as well as in
improving regulatory and supervisory arrangements in the financial sector as a whole. It has
already requested and received the support of several important development partners such as
USAID and the EC. Government has asked the Bank to play a coordinating role in this area in
addition to providing needed technical and financial assistance. In response, the Bank has begun
providing technical assistance towards an assessment of the nature and scope of the restructuring
that is likely to be required in the banking sector. It is expected that this will be followed by a
Financial Sector Restructuring Loan in FY07. The Bank is also able to offer policy advice in the
area of financial services diversification, including through the postal network and online
channels. IFC’s proposed support covers a range of possibilities including, but not limited to,
investments in privatized banks and other financial sector entities, deepening of the financial
sector through new products or developing bond markets, financial services for SME
development (particularly through PEP-MENA), and advisory assistance for privatization.
79. Three other activities deserve mention. First, the Bank has begun preparing a project to
create an efficient enabling environment for a mortgage market. This project would establish a
market-based liquidity facility, strengthen the regulatory framework, and modernize property
rights registration, thereby helping invigorate what is presently a moribund mortgage market.
Prior to starting work on the project, the Bank had provided substantial policy and technical
advice in this area. Second, the Bank has provided technical assistance to improve the functioning
of capital markets through establishing an Institute of Directors. Improvements in corporate
governance in the private sector could also be instrumental in building a broader and deeper
capital market through increasing the level of confidence of potential market participants. Third,
the Bank Group is providing technical assistance to build capacity to follow up on initiatives
related to anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). There are
plans to develop a certificate program for AML/CFT compliance officers.
80. Lower transactions costs pertaining to international trade (CAS outcome 1.2). As noted
earlier, a restructuring of trade tariffs was announced in September 2004 and there are plans to
further reduce transactions costs through improvements in customs and standards administration
as well as through implementation of a range of free trade agreements recently signed by the
Government with such partners as the EU, the US, and neighboring Arab and African countries.
The Bank and the IMF have worked closely with the authorities in these areas in recent years and

23

stand ready to continue their technical assistance programs as needed. It is expected that Egypt’s
trade policy environment will continue to be reviewed and re-assessed in future analytical work,
especially in the proposed Development Policy Review (FY07). In particular, analytic work will
evaluate the scope for efficiency gains through liberalizing trade in services and enhancing trade
facilitation.
81. Reduced transactions costs for operating businesses (CAS Outcome 1.3). An Investment
Climate Assessment conducted by the Bank recently has revealed a number of impediments to the
expansion of private investment in Egypt. Among these are access to land, access to finance,
especially for SMEs, and the tax environment (covering both rates and administration). In
addition, earlier surveys conducted under the Doing Business initiative have revealed high
transactions costs related to registering, operating and closing businesses. The Government has
recently asked for deeper analysis in four areas, namely, (a) access to finance: focusing on both
the demand and the supply side for financial institutions, cost of funding, credit policies, rising
liquidity ratio of the banking system, diversity of financial products, financial leasing, and nonperforming loans from the enterprises side; (b) access to land, focusing mainly on issues of
allocation of land, state land management and property registration; (c) free zones and their
prospects within the recent global trend, and (d) industrial land. In addition, the Bank is working
with the Government to develop a national Public Private Partnership (PPP) Strategy. Through
PEP-MENA, IFC can provide technical assistance to improve the business enabling environment.
82. The Bank proposes to help lower business transactions costs through both specific
investments and continued analytic and advisory assistance. In the former category, the
Alexandria Growth Pole project is being prepared with a view to helping the city of Alexandria
strengthen the management of existing municipal assets, especially land and properties, so that
they can be leased, sold or otherwise converted into more productive assets. Inter alia, the
project will help to better integrate the urban poor into the local economy through slum
upgrading, public-private partnerships, local area initiatives and community-based approaches.
Regarding analytic work, an Urban Sector Study is proposed for FY07. Its main objective will be
to complete analytical work on challenges facing the urban sector especially with regard to
regional competitiveness, public-private partnership in housing supply, service delivery,
protection of agriculture land from the uncontrolled expansion of informal urban settlements and
suggest options for reform in this sector. Finally, follow up data gathering is expected both under
the aegis of the Investment Climate Assessment and that of the Doing Business initiative. With
regard to utilities/infrastructure, in particular telecommunications, the Bank in association with
other development partners, is well-positioned to advise the government on issues including:
options for improving connectivity, including through broadband, regulatory incentives for open
network provision, alternative telecommunications networks and other new technologies, and on
financing options for rural communications. This assistance will be delivered through a series of
policy notes and dialogue with relevant stakeholders.
83. Costs can be lowered and investments facilitated by guarantee facilities as well. MIGA
provided its first political risk insurance guarantee in Egypt to a Spanish investor in FY04. The
project involved a management contract awarded by the Cairo Governorate for the management
of solid waste. A particular focus of MIGA’s efforts in Egypt in the future will be to support
investments in the agribusiness, manufacturing and services sectors, which tend to be dominated
by SMEs. MIGA will also market its Small Investors’ Program, which provides streamlined
coverage to SMEs, throughout the MENA region.
Enhancing the provision of public services
84. Fiscal and monetary policy consistent with macroeconomic stability (CAS outcome 2.1).
At the Government’s invitation, the Bank has begun to work on the management and

24

prioritization of public expenditures in Egypt. The current work program includes assessments of
public expenditures on education, health, transport and water as well as on the sustainability of
the public debt. It is proposed that other critical areas of inquiry will be addressed through future
policy notes prepared under the aegis of a series of Public Expenditure Reviews. Other aspects of
macroeconomic management, such as monetary and exchange rate policy, fall primarily within
the domain of the IMF and the Bank proposes to keep on top of relevant developments through
periodic consultations with the IMF and through its own routine economic monitoring.
85. Expanded supply and improved efficiency of infrastructure services (CAS outcome 2.2).
The success of the reform program will depend to a large extent on the depth of restructuring and
streamlining of government bodies responsible for infrastructure and the investment supply
response of the private sector. Government plans to facilitate this response not only by changing
some key policy parameters but also by undertaking institutional reforms and making some
strategic infrastructure investments, in such areas as electricity generation and transport, for
example. The Bank Group proposes to support these investments through technical and financial
assistance. The FY06-09 lending program contains projects to help improve water management
(West Delta, Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure, and Urban Water/Wastewater)
increase electricity generation (El Tebbin Power and follow up project) and improve
transportation (Ports Sector Development, Roads Development and Asset Management, Railways
Sector Investment and Restructuring, Urban Transport SWAP). An integrated approach to
promote more efficient delivery of urban and rural infrastructure services, local economic
development and regional competitiveness will be applied through a couple of Integrated
Governorates Development projects. These are expected to enhance linkages between urban
markets and rural production, as well as provide private sector investment opportunities in
selected governorates. Analytic work in the area of transport sector development, especially on
the restructuring of the railways system, road network management and urban transport policy, is
also envisaged. Analytical work and policy advice on telecommunications infrastructure, noted
above, is also relevant in this regard.
86. Finally, the Bank proposes to facilitate private sector participation in public infrastructure
projects through technical assistance (a workshop was organized in December 2004 and further
initiatives are planned for later) as well as through lending (e.g. via West Delta and El-Tebbin
Power projects). The focus of the Bank’s assistance will be on elimination of certain restrictions
that are presently imposed on the private sector’s participation in infrastructure projects; setting a
clear and unambiguous regulatory framework and quality standards for such participation;
establishing a system to select investors through transparent and competitive procedures; and
highlighting the need for rationalization of costs, prices and subsidies in various sectors. IFC is
also able to support infrastructure privatizations and public private partnerships, as well as to
provide financing for private sector infrastructure investments.
87. Improved quality and relevance at all levels of education system (CAS outcome 2.3). Egypt
has developed (with the assistance of the Bank and other development partners) a long term (20
year) vision for the education sector. This vision has informed a number of policy and program
innovations in recent years. The country has achieved much success in providing access to
education to the majority of its citizens, although gaps still exist in remote regions and for
disadvantaged populations. From the point of view of supporting the education sector in the
future, the priority issues have to do with quality and curriculum choice. The importance of
improving quality can hardly be overestimated given the need to improve Egyptian school
children’s performance in most subjects, but particularly in math and science as well as the high
rates of unemployment among high school graduates. Curriculum choice is also important,
especially in view of the science and technology needs of a knowledge economy and the demand
for such skills in Egypt.

25

88. In order to reach these objectives, and consistent with the approach of the Ministry of
Education (MOE), the Bank will focus on policies and programs to (a) improve quality and
curricular relevance (through teacher training, testing and a rational approach to technology
introduction in classrooms); (b) ensure appropriate curricular linkages across educational levels
(e.g., linkages between secondary technical track education, vocational/skills training, and higher
technical institutes); (c) explore connections with other sub-sectors such as health and nutrition
(e.g., school health and feeding programs), social protection, infrastructure and transportation
sectors (e.g., road linkages to schools) as well as with the private sector (e.g., skills of graduates
entering the labor market and skills development among in-service employees), these approaches
being particularly relevant for reaching out to disadvantaged populations with quality education
services; and (d) develop and implement national standards and strengthen monitoring,
accreditation and quality assurance processes at all educational levels (including for the private
educational establishments). These areas of support will be prominent in the Bank’s future
program, reflected in such activities as an Education Sector Review in FY06 and an Education
Enhancement II Project in FY07. In addition, these activities will continue to pay special
attention to gender concerns and the cost-effectiveness of education spending. Bank support will
also focus on helping identify areas of inefficiency (through the ongoing PER exercise) and
helping the Ministry of Education in implementing workable recommendations in a phased
manner. The PER exercise has already looked at some aspects of education spending (e.g.,
capital investments and textbooks). In addition, Bank support will include capacity building in the
Ministry of Education.
89. Improved water resource management and air quality (CAS outcome 2.4). The Bank’s
overall approach aims to mainstream environmental considerations in both the lending portfolio
and the government’s policies and programs. The lending program will focus on two sub-sectors:
(1) Water Quality/Integrated Irrigation Improvement. The Bank is developing a portfolio of
projects aimed particularly at improving water/wastewater quality. This includes the West Delta
Irrigation Project (FY06) to support the implementation of an innovative partnership with the
private sector for the management of water resources in the West Delta region, incorporating
environmental objectives and components into the design of both institutional reforms and
investment operations. There will also be emphasis on sanitation services and water demand
management through such projects as Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure (FY08)
and Urban Water/Wastewater (FY09). In both the lending program and related analytic work, the
Bank will focus on the issues of governance of water agencies, private sector participation,
coordination among stakeholders, rational pricing of water services and incentives for water
reallocation and pollution control. (2) Air Quality and Waste Management. Learning from the
successful implementation of a precursor we are preparing a follow-up project, the Pollution
Abatement Project II, whose objective is to reduce pollution generated by point-source/industrial
entities in the region of Alexandria and Cairo, in order to limit impacts on public health as well as
on ecological systems. The project will introduce for the first time in Egypt a combination of
IBRD lending, GEF and revenues from the sale of carbon emissions reductions. The Bank will
also be co-financing with GEF, the Solar Thermal Hybrid Project (in FY06) whose objective is to
contribute to improving the economic attractiveness of solar thermal technology globally. Efforts
will continue to be made towards harmonizing the environmental review and resettlement
procedures followed by the Bank and by Egypt. Towards this end, one or two Bank financed
projects will be designed to serve as pilots. Finally, analytic support will be focused on three
areas where the Bank has comparative advantage and global experience: (i) the use of economic
criteria and valuation of externalities; (ii) the linkage between environment and poverty
reduction, energy and environment, women and environment, and banking and environment; and
(iii) the strengthening of the decision-making process in water quality, solid waste management,
and rural water and sanitation sectors.

26

90. Strengthened accountability of public sector agencies (CAS outcome 2.5). International
experience shows that the impact and effectiveness of public sector agencies can be improved
through the introduction of such accountability mechanisms as: performance evaluations for
senior management, performance based budgets, unified accounting rules for the treatment of
SOE profits, strengthened legislatures (e.g., budget and finance committees or public accounts
committees with enhanced powers of scrutiny over the budget) and greater information disclosure
about service delivery targets and achievements. Government is presently formulating plans for
public sector administrative reforms that encompass some of these objectives. The Bank Group,
which has previously provided technical assistance in the area of performance budgeting, stands
ready to provide support as well for other initiatives aimed at strengthening public sector
accountability. A particular focus should be on building the capacity to plan and prioritize
investments at the local administration level and to ensure that operating and maintenance costs
are adequately budgeted. Analytical work and dissemination of best practices on sustainable and
replicable models for selected e-government services would contribute to this outcome as well.
91. Accountability can also be strengthened through further improvements in financial
management. Egypt has a French-style public financial management system featuring a powerful
Ministry of Finance and a strong legal framework for the development, implementation, and
monitoring of the budget. Recent Bank analyses (Country Financial Accountability Assessment,
2003 and Institutional Financial Management Capacity Assessment, 2005) suggest that the
efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of public funds can be further enhanced through
such measures as the implementation of GFMIS and modern internal audit functions, and
strengthening of the capacity of finance staff in the MOF and high-spending line ministries. The
Bank will continue to work with appropriate Government agencies towards this end.
92. Improved coverage, quality and sustainability of social insurance (CAS outcome 2.6).
Social policy is an important priority for Government and one in which the Bank has much
experience and information to share. A program of support is envisaged in three areas: social
insurance, labor market regulations, and skills development. Social insurance reforms in such
areas as health insurance, old age pensions, and unemployment assistance are important to ensure
fiscal stability, support financial sector development, improve the functioning of labor markets,
and ultimately enhance both growth and equity. At Government’s request, the Bank has started a
study on the pension system in Egypt (to be completed in FY06) with the aim of identifying key
reform areas and transition arrangements. Regarding health, we propose to include in-depth
analytical work on health finance and health insurance reform in the context of wider
programmatic ESW on Health and Population Sector Strategy. Regarding labor markets, the
Bank is proposing analytic work (in FY07) to develop a better understanding of employment
structure, regulations and labor market programs in Egypt. This could help in developing better
programs to facilitate enterprise restructuring and labor reallocation in the context of greater
competition. The Bank is also active in the area of vocational training, in collaboration with the
EC, through the Skills Development Project. This ongoing project aims to change the paradigm
of vocational training in Egypt by placing more emphasis on the role of the private sector in
articulating training needs, providing training and improving its quality. Future support could
take the form of evaluations of training programs and the practices adopted by the public and
private sectors for assessing training needs. In addition, analytical work could be conducted to
review constraints to in-service training and the private provision of training.
Promoting Equity
93. Improved coverage and effectiveness of safety nets for the poor (CAS outcome 3.1). The
Bank has been involved for some time now in analyzing the coverage and effectiveness of safety
nets for the poor in Egypt. Most recently, this issue was covered in a Poverty Strategy Report
(September, 2004) and a high-level ministerial workshop on social safety nets (February, 2005).

27

Given the strong interest of Government and civil society in this area, the Bank will continue to
provide analytical and financial assistance as necessary. The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
item in the work program provides a vehicle for continued analytic support.
94. Reduced disparities between Lower and Upper Egypt (CAS outcome 3.2). Helping Upper
Egypt requires a focus on its special developmental challenges. Among these is the need to better
identify local priorities and use more flexible mechanisms to deliver public services. This can be
done in part through greater involvement of local administrations, community organizations and
NGOs in the selection and delivery of public services. The Bank proposes to address such
challenges in selected analytical work (as part of the Public Expenditure Review exercise) as well
as in lending (Education Enhancement II, Social Fund IV and Integrated Governorates projects).
The last-mentioned projects will focus on both urban and rural development and will aim at (i)
de-concentration of public services delivery, with more responsibility transferred to local
administrations; (ii) improved access to social services and economic opportunities, and (iii)
involvement of civil society in planning and implementation. This would be achieved through
support for (i) capacity building of local officials and local council members in planning,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation functions, using participatory approaches; and (ii)
investments in infrastructure and improved services to support governorate/district level plans
and help Upper Egyptians take advantage of economic opportunities. Nurturing economic
opportunities is a necessary complement to the provision of social services and basic
infrastructure (health, education, rural roads, water and sanitation). For such projects, the Bank
would seek partnerships with other donors.
95. Improved access and quality of healthcare for poor (CAS outcome 3.3). Addressing the
persistent inequities among regions and income groups in access to basic health and population
services is a priority for Government. This issue is particularly relevant with respect to Upper
Egypt where fertility rates remain very high and maternal and child health indicators remain
extremely poor. Addressing issues of unequal access requires not only improvements in the
quality and availability of health services but behavioral changes as well at the household and
community levels. The Bank has been actively pursuing such changes in past projects. The
ongoing Population Project (due to close in April 2005) offers an interesting model of
complementary components supported by the Ministry of Health and Population, which focused
on improving the quality and availability of health services, and the Social Fund for Development
which focused on participatory and community-based interventions targeted at behavioral
changes. We propose to build on this experience in the Family Health Project as well as through
further analytical work (Health and Population Sector Strategy).
96. Decreased gender disparities (CAS outcome 3.4). At present, the Bank is facilitating social
development, especially relating to women, through bringing a group perspective to bear in
analytical work and selected investment projects. Examples of the latter include support for the
formation of user groups in irrigation projects, involvement of women’s groups in social fund
activities, and capacity building for community organizations across a broad range of activities
(in Sohag and other disadvantaged regions). Such support will be continued in the future. In
analytic work, studies will be conducted to follow up on the country gender assessment
completed recently. In particular, barriers and constraints to female entrepreneurship will be
investigated in the context of the Investment Climate Assessment currently under way. Work will
also be continued with the National Council for Women (NCW) through an already-disbursing
grant to help build the capacity to conduct strategic planning, performance measurement, and
develop data and information systems to facilitate gender mainstreaming in policies, programs
and projects.

28

E. Assistance Program Scenarios
97.
A base case program of $500 million a year on average is proposed in order to support
the key development objectives of the CAS over FY06-09. From a structural and macroeconomic
policy perspective we judge that Egypt is now in the base case and our objective should be to
provide financial and analytical support to maintain the present macroeconomic policy
framework and reform status. In particular, it should be noted that Egypt has already met several
conditions that were under discussion in FY01-04 for a higher lending program. These include
exchange rate adjustments and reforms in the foreign exchange management system,
restructuring of trade tariffs and customs administration processes, and the presentation to
parliament of a new law aimed at reforming tax rates and tax administration. Hence we propose a
larger assistance program than in the previous CAS. Furthermore, the base case program is
heavily oriented towards support for infrastructure projects, a feature that meets three tests of
potentially high development effectiveness, namely, existence of demand from the country,
substantial relevance to future growth and development, and alignment with the Bank Group’s
comparative advantage. Broadly speaking, the base case program corresponds to conditions
described in the baseline medium-term scenario described in Section II.B of this document.
98. A high case lending scenario with an average commitment of $700 million per annum is
also envisaged. Such a scenario is predicated on implementation of reforms in the financial sector
(see paragraph 20 for details). In particular, restructuring all public sector banks will require
substantial public funding. The Government has invited the Bank to participate in determining
the exact scope of the required funding through assessments of the financial status of the public
sector banks and their performing and non-performing assets. At the same time, the Government
has requested that the Bank be ready to support the reform program through both technical
assistance and loans. Since financial sector reform is central to improving the climate for private
sector development, we propose a high case program to accommodate two quick-disbursing
loans. While the financing needed for these operations is not yet known, we propose, on
exposure management grounds, that overall lending not exceed $2.8 billion over the next four
years in the high case. Consideration of the high case program will be determined by two
triggers: (a) clear signs of implementation of substantive financial sector reforms, including
significant restructuring (and recapitalization) of the public sector banks, and movement towards
the privatization of the Bank of Alexandria; and (b) the adoption of a financing plan under which
at least 10 percent of the total funding needs of the financial sector restructuring program is to be
met from non-debt-creating sources. Such sources could include, but not necessarily be limited
to, grants from donors and proceeds from the privatization of state-owned enterprises, divestiture
of public shares in joint public-private banks, and the sale of the Bank of Alexandria. Adherence
to such a plan will limit the increase in public debt arising from implementation of the financial
sector reform program, which in turn will facilitate macroeconomic management until the
benefits of the reform begin to accrue, notably until growth accelerates and public debt ratios
stabilize and finally decrease.
99. A low case scenario would result from a dilution in the program of structural reforms and
deterioration in the macroeconomic policy framework. On the structural side, a significant
dilution of the present program of trade, tax, investment climate and financial sector reforms
would create concerns about the sustainability of medium-term growth of 5 percent or above. On
the macroeconomic side, a weakening of the good monetary and exchange rate policies followed
in recent years or a deterioration in the consolidated fiscal deficit for reasons unrelated to the
proposed trade, tax and financial sector reforms, would raise similar concerns. If such conditions
arise, the Bank would move to a low case lending program which, depending on the severity of
the deterioration, could decrease to an average of $250 million per annum.

IV. MANAGING RISKS
A. Country Creditworthiness and Exposure to the Bank Group
100. Egypt currently meets all guidelines for Bank Group debt exposure by comfortable margins and
implementation of the CAS lending scenarios does not create a risk of exceeding the exposure limits.
One guideline limits Bank exposure to any single country to $13.5 billion. The Bank’s current
exposure is just over $1 billion. The base case lending scenario would add $2.0 billion to this
exposure over four years while a high case scenario would add $2.8 billion. Under both scenarios, we
would stay far below the single country exposure guideline. A second guideline pertains to the share
of export earnings absorbed by debt service to the Bank. The current guidelines are 6 percent for
countries in the low-risk category, 5 percent for those in medium risk, and 4 percent for those in
severe-risk category. Our simulations suggest that Egypt’s debt service to the Bank will not exceed 1
percent of its exports even under the high case lending scenario. Finally, a third guideline suggests
that the Bank Group’s share of public and publicly guaranteed debt service should not exceed 20
percent and preferred creditor debt service should not exceed 35 percent. Our simulations show that
even under the high case lending scenario, the Bank Group’s share in Egypt’s public debt will not
exceed 8 percent, and preferred creditor debt service will not exceed 25 percent.
101. External judgments of Egypt’s creditworthiness have varied in recent years. In June 2002,
Egypt was able to sell its first sovereign international bond, raising $1.5 billion which was three
times the original target. From 2001 through most of 2004, its ratings declined in response to
slow growth, inconsistent reform efforts and rising fiscal deficits. Following the announcement of
reform measures by the new Government in July 2004 and the improvement in the economy
during the year, Egypt’s credit rating has been rising. For example, the overall country risk rating
assigned by the Economist Intelligence Unit to Egypt improved from 50 in September 2004 to 48
in November 2004 and has since been constant. Ratings assigned by Standard and Poor’s and by
Fitch have also improved in recent months and are now at BB+ with a stable outlook.
102. At 88 percent, Egypt’s public debt to output ratio is high relative to what is considered desirable
for macroeconomic stability. However, fiscal sustainability analysis suggests that this level is
manageable under a higher growth trajectory than experienced in recent years. For example, analysis
suggests that the debt/GDP ratio will decline moderately over FY06-09 if the economy grows at the
baseline rate of 5 percent on average over this period. Analysis also suggests that implementation of
the base case CAS lending program will not worsen Egypt’s debt sustainability. However, the high
case lending scenario would lead to an increase in the debt/GDP ratio and thus be more difficult to
manage (see Box 2). In this case, it would be advisable to limit the increase in debt by relying as much
as possible on non-debt sources of finance. At the same time, it is worth noting that Egypt’s external
debt is moderate (less than 30 percent of GDP as of FY 2004), owed largely to official sources and
heavily tilted towards medium and long term liabilities. These characteristics help keep external debt
servicing costs low.
B. Implementation Risks
103. Risks may emerge from both external and domestic sources. Attention has been drawn
previously to the high correlation between OECD growth rates and Egypt’s economic performance.
This link is likely to be enhanced as Egypt pursues greater integration with global markets through
implementation of trade agreements with the EU, the US and regional partners. The downside of
greater integration is a greater susceptibility to external shocks. If world economic growth falls
sharply relative to current expectations, this may lead to a larger impact on Egypt’s growth than has
historically been the case. Regional instability in the Middle East and North Africa and increased
concerns about internal and external security could also affect Egypt’s economy and society in the
coming years, particularly if they affect tourism and foreign investment flows.

31

Box 2: Egypt’s Public Debt
The consolidated net public debt for Egypt, as derived from data published by the Central Bank of
Egypt, was 88 percent of GDP at the end of FY04, comprising an external debt of 29 percent of GDP and a
domestic debt of 59 percent. The term “consolidated” means that the measure is arrived at by netting out
all intra-governmental transactions. In particular, transfers from the Social Insurance Funds in the amount
of just over 40 percent of GDP are netted out.
Four aspects of the public debt provide cause for concern. First, the current level is high, well above
the 60 percent that is conventionally used as a threshold of concern. Second, the debt has been rising since
FY00, after having declined steadily through the 1990s, suggesting a fiscal policy dynamic at work that
needs to be arrested and then reversed. Third, this debt level has been reached despite substantial cuts in
public investment and government capital expenditures. This suggests that the room for maneuver is
increasingly limited and a more aggressive strategy of current expenditure control and treasury
management is now required. Fourth, financing needs have typically been larger (by about 2 percent of
GDP in recent years) than budget deficits on account of sizable “arrears” and “adjustments for errors.”
At the same time, however, some other aspects suggest that the debt situation might be more
manageable then what the above ratios and trends suggest. First, the measure of debt reported here does not
take into account approximately 70 billion Egyptian pounds held by the Government in “blocked” accounts
at the Central Bank of Egypt. These accounts were set up to hold funds for eventual repayment of external
obligations that were rescheduled in 1991. For FY2004, an adjustment of 70 billion Egyptian pounds would
have reduced the net debt to 73 percent of GDP. Not enough information was available to forecast how the
receipts and outflows from this account would affect the public debt level in future years. Furthermore, the
institutional characteristics of Egypt’s public debt suggest that it might be less sensitive to classic marketbased reactions. For example, the fact that around 70 percent of the domestic debt is held by domestic
financial institutions, rather than external agents, reduces refinancing and rollover risks, although it could
compromise the efficiency of the domestic financial system. Such risks are also reduced by the fact that the
external debt is long term in nature, highly concessional, and held by official sources, rather than by
commercial banks or bondholders.
Fiscal sustainability analysis suggests that the debt ratio would stabilize and slightly decline (to 85
percent in FY2009) under the assumption that economic growth will average 5 percent per annum and that
additional external debt in the amount of $2 billion would be obtained at official development assistance
terms. However, the acquisition of significantly higher debt, in the amount of $9 billion (of which $6
billion equivalent is assumed to be in domestic currency) does worsen the debt trajectory, leading to a peak
debt ratio as high as 92 percent by 2009. Under the circumstances, a desirable strategy for Egypt would be
one that generates growth without raising the public debt significantly and thus one that relies largely on
private investment to serve as the engine of growth. To the extent that some growth-supporting reforms,
such as financial sector restructuring, might be financed by additional debt, it would be desirable to obtain
a large share of this on concessional terms while relying as much as possible on non-debt sources of
funding.

104. Risks may also arise from domestic sources. The current optimism with regard to
achieving higher growth over the medium run depends to a large extent on the credibility of the
present reform program. If domestic social and political developments lead to a delay or dilution
of the announced reform program, this is likely to have an adverse impact on private investment
and growth. Some tensions are inherent in the reform process itself. For example, economic
reforms may lead to social discontent if the employment and price effects on vulnerable groups
are not adequately addressed through fiscal and social policy measures. Furthermore, Egypt is
also simultaneously embarking on a political reform process that will increase the level of
political competition as well as the public’s access to information and expression of voice. While
this process will undoubtedly be beneficial in the long run, it could affect the pace of reforms in
the short run.

32

105. There is also a risk emanating from possible deficiencies in the institutional capacity
needed to implement the reform program and manage the social and political tensions that may
come into play. Some reassurance can be drawn from the fact that Egypt successfully
implemented an ambitious reform program in the early 1990s, featuring a broad range of
stabilization measures and structural reforms and including a substantial fiscal adjustment of
almost 15 percent of GDP. Comfort can also be derived from the fact that project implementation
has been improving in recent years. Nevertheless, the implementation challenges ahead are
substantial and will require special attention to issues of public sector skills, incentives and
governance.
106. Both external and domestic risks can be mitigated through the implementation of the multifaceted reform program described in the CAS. The Bank Group can play a useful role by
providing strategic and high-impact financial support, continuing to demonstrate the expected
benefits of selected reforms through quality analytical work, and helping to build coalitions of
support within Government, civil society and the international community. However, what is
likely to be of decisive importance in the success of this CAS is the degree of ownership of the
reform agenda exhibited by the Government of Egypt. At present, this is demonstrably high.

Annex 2: CAS Completion Report
Date of CAS: June 2001
Period Covered by CAS: FY02-04
Report Prepared by: Habib Fetini (Bank Staff) and Clive Gray (Consultant)
Date: April 27, 2004
Purpose and Methodology
This is the CAS Completion Report (CCR) of the Egypt Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for FY 2002-2004. The main objective of this report is twofold: to assess the effectiveness
of the country strategy in bringing about the expected results, and to highlight the key lessons that
have been learned during this period. The report also aims at stimulating reflection about
assistance strategies and outcomes, and contributing to the deliberations already started within the
World Bank and with the Government on the new country strategy for FY 06-09. The primary
audience of this report is the World Bank country team and national counterparts.
The CCR relies on written documents, oral briefings by World Bank country team
members, discussions with GOE counterparts in Cairo, and information gathered from other Bank
staff. Key reference documents include the Country Assistance Strategy FY02-04; the Egypt
Projects Results Page and Portfolio Status, November 2003; project concept/identification
notes/documents, and appraisal reports; QAG and OED reports; and AAA products.
Overview
i.
According to the CAS for Egypt approved by the Board in June 2001, the “over-arching
objective of the Bank Group’s country strategy in Egypt is to reduce poverty and
unemployment.” Noting that unemployment was high in Egypt and that Government was aiming
for a growth rate of about 7.0-7.5 percent, the CAS drew attention to the need for certain
structural measures, including reduction of tariffs, simplification of customs procedures, tax
reform, reduction/better targeting of subsidies, more active privatization, reform of the
commercial code and its application, reforms of the financial system, and a more open foreign
borrowing policy. In the event, a combination of external developments (such as low OECD
growth) and domestic policies (such as tardiness in dealing with an overvalued exchange rate in
2001-02 and hesitant steps in other potential reform areas) led to much slower growth of the
economy than expected. Nevertheless, there continued to be active engagement with the Bank
through reviews of poverty, gender, the financial sector, education, health and through
negotiations over a Policy-Based Loan (PBL). As a result the prospects for reforms are much
better for the next CAS period.
ii.
The 2001 CAS outlined three scenarios for Bank assistance to Egypt, described as high-,
base- and low-case. Some triggers for each of the scenarios were met—policy dialogue
intensified, a joint Poverty Assessment was carried out, and the quality of the Bank’s portfolio
improved significantly (all high-case), but the fiscal deficit worsened from 4.4 percent in 2001 to
6.4 percent in FY03 (low-case). Only three of eight new CAS-projected Bank loans were
approved by June 2004, totaling $68 million against a planned $450 million. However, the late
addition of a major infrastructure loan not foreseen in the CAS--$335 million for Cairo and
Sharm El Sheikh airports—brought total approvals, at $368 million, to 82 percent of the CAS
total.

42

iii.
The Bank continued to implement 19 loan/credit projects approved before June 30, 2001.
These were concentrated in three sectors, namely agriculture, water & rural development (eight
projects), education (three), and health & population (five). Three other projects were underway
in tourism (two projects) and pollution abatement. Four new projects were approved, one in
agriculture, two in education and training, and one in infrastructure (the airports project
mentioned above). Meanwhile, the IFC committed twelve new projects in a range of sectors,
notably the financial sector, transport infrastructure, SMEs, manufacturing, gas fields, and
chemicals. IFC also co-financed a new technical assistance facility to support SME development.
MIGA executed two investment guarantees.

CAS implementation: Lessons for four main clusters of Bank activity
iv.
Key findings from the implementation of the 2001 CAS relate to structural reforms in
general as well as to development strategy in three sectors, namely agriculture and water,
education, and health.
•

Structural reforms. Government’s approach to structural reforms during the previous CAS
was hesitant. This was due in part to understandable worries about the short run
implications for employment and public revenues from proposed reforms. Future analytic
work must focus not only on the overall benefits of the reforms in the long run but also on
their short-run costs for different sectors and groups. It should also be noted that, when a
decision was made by the Cabinet appointed in July 2004 to accelerate reforms, the fact
that a solid analytic basis was available in prior work done by the Bank Group (and other
development partners), especially in the financial sector and trade policy areas, made it
easier to determine what to emphasize in the reforms. This highlights the need to remain
committed to a substantial analytic and advisory program even if there is a decline in the
pace of actual reforms.

•

Agriculture and water. Apart from the need to reorient lending in this sector to channel
more benefits to the poor of Upper Egypt, future Bank/GOE collaboration must address
creatively the low water productivity and lack of cost recovery in Egypt’s irrigated
agriculture. Other issues to be faced are decentralization of water management to water
users’ associations, and how to curb the harm to downstream farm families caused by
upstream pollution of the Nile. Both the Bank and GOE have become increasingly aware of
the confluence of issues of irrigation and drainage, and rural water and sanitation. The
Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management Project, scheduled for approval in
FY05, is designed to meet this concern.

•

Education. Egypt’s human resource base is still far from being competitive in the
international knowledge-based economy. The new CAS must consider how the Bank can
provide a critical mass of support to achieve that objective within the next generation. It
must focus on developing better national standards to guide curricula and measure
improvements in relevant learning. The standards should reflect international experience
and be linked to teacher and administrator incentives in order to improve accountability and
quality of teaching and learning.

•

Health and social services. Approaches to health insurance tested in earlier Bank projects
have not proved viable. A key issue for the new CAS is to design alternative approaches
that cope adequately with risk management. Preconditions for continued Bank financing
should include political support for a given reform by way of necessary legislation.

43

I. Implementation of the 2001 CAS
1.
The 2001 CAS, covering the period FY02-04, envisaged the Bank’s assistance program
in Egypt as continuing a long-standing focus on four activity clusters deemed central to
alleviation of poverty. These include promotion of sustainable macroeconomic growth, pari
passu with concomitant structural reform, and development of three key sectors, namely,
agriculture and water resources, education, and health and other social services.
2.
The bulk of this Completion Report (Sections II-VIII) views implementation of the 2001
CAS in a dynamic framework, highlighting the principal clusters of Bank intervention along with
the factors that affected the Bank’s strategy during the three years FY02-04.
3.
Section II discusses the shared Bank-GOE objective to alleviate poverty, and shows how
the joint poverty assessment that was carried out brought this goal to the forefront. Section III
summarizes the initial strategy and evolution of each of the four activity clusters. Section IV cites
the benchmarks and triggers set forth in the CAS in regard to high-, base- and low-case scenarios
of Bank activity during the CAS period, and compares these with the actual evolution of the
Bank’s portfolio. Sections V through VIII describe the four activity clusters in turn, departing
from the initial strategy pursued in accordance with the CAS; tracing its evolution in the light of
external events and new information; and indicating key findings for the next (FY06-09) CAS.
Section IX describes other Bank Group activities, notably the investments of IFC, analytical and
advisory assistance (AAA), and capacity building by the World Bank Institute. Section X
summarizes the CAS 2001’s statement of project selection criteria, targets for program
implementation, and intended procedural improvements, and analyzes the degree of fulfillment of
those objectives during the CAS period.
II. A Shared Objective: Alleviation of Poverty
4.

The CAS describes the GOE’s “over-arching objective,” as that of achieving a private
sector-led growth rate of 7.0-7.5 percent that would create gainful employment opportunities and
reduce the incidence of poverty. It goes on to note that, notwithstanding this objective, as of
2001, absence of Bank/GOE dialogue about the problem of poverty in Egypt “prevents the Bank
from developing a truly effective poverty alleviation strategy.” Moreover the Government had not
yet granted outside researchers access to the 1995-96 and 1999-2000 Household Income,
Expenditure and Consumption Surveys.

5.

Poverty assessment. This changed with the onset in FY02 of a period of collaboration
between the Bank and the Egyptian Ministry of Planning in FY02 that envisaged work on both
poverty assessment and strategy formulation. The first output of this joint effort was the June
2002 report, Poverty Reduction in Egypt – Diagnosis and Strategy.

6.
The study constructed a novel food poverty line, taking into account regional differences
in prices as well as household age and size. The report established that the share of Egypt’s
population below the poverty line had fallen from 19.4 percent in the first period to 16.7 percent
in the second, although concern was expressed that slower economic growth after 2000 might
have reversed the trend. The study also found the distribution of poverty shifting from the
previous urban-rural divide to a geographical/regional pattern, poverty being both deeper and
more severe in Upper Egypt than elsewhere. Although inequality increased country-wide, in
Lower Egypt, where growth was highest, expenditures of the poorer population groups grew
faster than those of higher-income groups, indicating that growth had been pro-poor. The study
44

revealed education to be the strongest correlate of poverty, over 45 percent of the poor being
illiterate.

7.
Transfers, primarily from government, were shown to be a larger share of the income of
the nonpoor (15 percent) than of the poor (10 percent), arising from the fact that most poor do not
work in the regulated sector and so do not benefit from social insurance. While not an efficient
mechanism (since it is universal in design), the bread subsidy was shown to keep a large number
of people out of poverty.
8.
The publication of the poverty assessment in 2002, coupled with its wide public
distribution in Egypt, has already influenced Bank-GOE dialogue. A second collaborative output,
focusing on designing a strategy for poverty reduction, is scheduled for completion in FY05 to be
followed by further analytic work on the next HIECS that is to be conducted in 2005. Designing
a more efficient social safety net (covering the cash transfer program as well as selected
subsidies) is now a high priority for Government and the Bank’s technical assistance is being
sought in this regard.
9.
Gender assessment. Closely related to the poverty assessment, in FY02-03 the Bank and
the GOE’s National Council for Women collaborated on a gender assessment, leading to a report
of that title dated June 2003. The study found gender inequality to be correlated with income, and
established a strong link between women’s education and improved gender indicators. Gender
inequality in school enrollment was highest at secondary level in Rural Upper Egypt, where the
ratio of girls to boys in 1996/97 was only 0.51. The report called for future polices to continue to
emphasize reduction of gender disparities in education. It also recommended the following
measures: removal of discriminatory provisions under certain laws, particularly those governing
family relations; steps to equalize employment opportunity, compensation and social security;
steps to promote a culture valuing women as full and equal partners in development; and the
collection and dissemination of more economic and social data disaggregated by gender.
III.

Evolution of Strategy in the Four Clusters of Bank Activity: A Summary

Sustainable economic growth
10.

The macroeconomic context in Egypt deteriorated in several respects during the CAS
period. First, the growth rate fell steadily to an estimated 2.5 percent in 2003. Second, the
consolidated fiscal deficit rose from around 1 percent of GDP in FY00 to 2.9 percent in FY04.
This context, strongly influenced by adverse external events, both international and regional,
induced two financing requests from the GOE that were not anticipated in the 2001 CAS, one for
a $500 million Policy-Based Loan (to be split 50-50 with the African Development Bank), and
the other for a $335 million loan for the third terminal of Cairo Airport and for Sharm El-Sheikh
Airport, arising in a context where previously anticipated private financing for such projects was
not available on terms considered reasonable.

Agriculture and water resources
11.
Bank activity in this sector has been dominated for three decades by parallel loans to the
three main components of irrigation, namely distribution, pumping and drainage of Nile water.
During the CAS period, growing attention focused on two concerns, (i) the fact that Egyptian
agriculture features the lowest level of water productivity in the Middle East/North African
region, about US20¢ per cubic meter, and (ii) the health hazard posed by upstream pollution on
downstream farm families. As a result, the Bank’s strategy changed to help the authorities reform

45

the institutions that manage water distribution and modify the incentives faced by the various
actors, in a word to create an integrated management system. A new lending operation, named
Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management, was designed during the CAS period and
scheduled for approval in FY05. It combines irrigation, drainage and pumping station
improvements under one project.

12.
In parallel, and to address growing concerns regarding water quality and sanitation issues,
a study has been initiated to define the scope of a complementary lending operation in rural water
and sanitation, as envisaged in the 2001 CAS. This project will build on the community structures
and social capital created under the on-going water resource projects.
Education
13.
During the CAS period, advances in school numbers and enrollment made it clear that,
overall, access was no longer a major issue in the education system. While access in remote areas
and for disadvantaged and disabled children remained a concern, Bank support for Egyptian
education began to focus more on the quality dimension, i.e. how best to generate graduates with
technological and problem-solving skills demanded by both the domestic labor market and the
information-oriented global economy. Needs in this regard were articulated in a joint Bank-GOE
Education Sector Survey, completed in October 2002. Both education loans approved during the
CAS period—the Higher Education Enhancement Project (HEEP) and Skills Development
Project—emphasized quality. Creation of a quality assurance program for universities was a
central component of the HEEP.
Health and social services
14.
At the outset of the CAS period, the Bank’s major intervention in these sectors was
proceeding on the assumption that a way could be found to create near-universal insurance
coverage for primary health care services in three pilot governorates. In late 2002 the ruling
party’s health policy committee identified “extending health insurance coverage” as one of the
Government’s two key objectives in the sector. However, it soon became clear that
implementation of this goal depended in large part on reform of the national Health Insurance
Organization, which was not forthcoming. By end-2003, only 7 percent of the IDA health sector
credit had been disbursed. A Bank-led health sector reform and financing review identified key
reasons for the slow progress. Pending development of a new health insurance model, the
project’s focus has shifted to improvement of health services, including rationalization of
infrastructure.
IV.

CAS Benchmarks & Scenarios, and Evolution of the Bank Portfolio

15.
The CAS defines a set of four benchmarks to guide both lending and non-lending
involvement in Egypt during FY02-04, as well as four triggers for base-, high- and low-case
scenarios for the lending program. The benchmarks are:10

Benchmarks 1, 2 and 4 coincide with triggers listed in Table 1 following. Benchmark 3 is
not categorized as a trigger, and is analyzed in Section IX as a procedural target, while the
outcomes of the other three benchmarks are reviewed in this section.
Scenarios for the Bank’s lending program in FY02-04
17.

The CAS defines three scenarios for new Bank lending in Egypt during the period: a base
case (considered to be most likely) and high and low cases. These are summarized as follows:
•

Base case – continuation of the current pace of growth (5.0-5.5 percent p.a.) and policy
implementation; absence of “significant shocks or reversals of policy reforms, but also no
major structural reform breakthroughs”

•

High case – either a “major deepening of the structural reforms or a severe deterioration
in the external environment”

•

Low case – “implementation of policy reforms (deepening controls, halting structural
reforms)” and the Bank portfolio deteriorate considerably

18.
Table 1 details four main triggers for the three scenarios: the macroeconomic framework;
structural reforms; the quality of overall policy dialogue between the Bank and the GOE; and
management of the Bank’s portfolio.
19.
During 1996-2000, GDP grew, on average, by over 5 percent per year. Since then,
external shocks including the September 11, 2001 events in the United States and the U.S.-Iraq
war, contributed to a deceleration of GDP growth to 3.4 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.5 percent in
FYs ’01, ’02 and ’03, respectively. Domestic policy measures also played a role. Notwithstanding
12 percent depreciation of the Egyptian pound against the dollar during 2000, the CAS regarded
its continuing overvaluation as one element in the economy’s vulnerability. After averaging 9
percent of GDP during 1990-93, merchandise exports had dropped to 6.4 percent by 2000.11
20.
During 2001-02 the GOE allowed the official exchange rate to depreciate by another 25
percent. At end-January 2003 it announced a floating of the pound, allowing the central bank
(CBE) rate to fall another 25 percent by year’s end, from EP 4.62/$1 to around 6.20. During
2001-03 merchandise exports recovered modestly to average 7.3 percent of GDP—still far below
levels characteristic of newly industrializing economies.
21.
In order to stem the pound’s fall, during 2003 the GOE intervened in the float, inter alia
freezing government imports and requiring exporters to sell 75 percent of their proceeds to
domestic banks. Foreign investors’ remittance of profits and dividends was subject to delays. The
parallel exchange rate remained in existence and fluctuated widely, spiking in early October at EP
7.40, or 20 percent above the central bank rate, before dropping to EP 6.85 by end-February
2004.
22.

The CAS noted a worsening of the budget sector fiscal deficit, which rose from 0.9
percent of GDP in 1997 to average 3.9 percent in 1999-2000. This was attributed partly to
11

47

clearing of arrears as a stimulus to the private sector, but also to an increase in public investment
in “mega” projects. Skepticism was expressed about GOE efforts to attract more private Middle
Eastern investment in these projects. In the event, the deficit rose to –5.5 percent, -5.8 percent and
–6.4 percent in FYs ’01, ’02 and ’03 respectively. However it was expected to drop to -5.5
percent in FY04, mainly as a result of expenditure controls and the positive impact of exchange
rate depreciation on revenues.

23.

Regarding the balance of payments, the CAS noted pressures arising from the drop in
tourist receipts following the Luxor attack, as well as net outflows from the domestic banking
system reflecting a loss of confidence. During 1999-2000, net international reserves declined by
28 percent. By mid-2003 the current account was once again in surplus, but this was largely due
to an 18 percent drop in imports over the past three years, with predictable consequences for
growth. FY04 has seen a major improvement in the current account, partially offset by outflows
on capital account due to uncertainty about the exchange rate regime.

48

24.
The CAS cites an estimated current level of $1.5 billion in foreign direct investment
(FDI), noting the GOE’s intention to double it by 2010. Revised data show that FDI actually
reached $2.1 billion in FY00, but dropped to $600 million in FY03. These pressures, together
with skepticism about the GOE’s willingness to persevere with economic reform, were believed
to underlie decisions in 2002 by two credit rating agencies (Fitch and Standard & Poor) to
downgrade Egypt’s ability to service its long-term debt. S&P’s rating shifted Egyptian debt from
“investment” to “speculative,” thus raising the country’s borrowing costs.
Trend and impact of GOE policies during the CAS period
25.

The CAS refers to an unfinished agenda of structural reforms:

26.
Reform of tariffs and other trade barriers. The central policy theme of the 2001 CAS is
that Egypt must reverse the inward orientation of its economy, and promote non-oil
manufacturing exports as the main contributor to higher productivity, international
competitiveness, and thus economic growth. Success in this endeavor, according to the CAS,
requires more flexible exchange rate management, as well as reduction of the level and dispersion
of import tariffs, which create an anti-export bias in trade policy. Other factors underlying this
bias are identified as non-responsiveness of the public administration; antiquated customs
procedures, including outdated and inconsistent product standards and quality control; and
inadequate export finance.
27.
The nominal floating of the currency in January 2003, and the subsequent depreciation of
the central bank rate, represented a step towards more flexible exchange rate management,
although this was partially offset by the measures of intervention cited above. As regards tariff
reform, given the fiscal situation, and the fact that import tariffs account for about 20 percent of
tax revenue12, the GOE was reluctant to take steps that would reduce taxes in the absence of
offsetting revenue-enhancing measures. It was also concerned about the employment impact of
lower protection for import-substituting industries.
28.
In early 2003 an IMF team studied the revenue impact of alternative tariff reforms and
advised that reducing the number of tariff bands from the present 28 to five would have only a
modest revenue impact. At mid-year the tariff question was a subject of dialogue between the
Bank and the GOE during early negotiations for a Policy-Based Loan (see below).
29.

At the end of the CAS period, tariffs on apparel were being made WTO-compliant, and
tariffs on certain basic and intermediate goods were being reduced. Some steps were also
underway to reduce the dispersion of tariffs and reduce tariffs on IT. In early 2003 the GOE
established a schedule for a series of customs reforms, some of which were completed later in the
year (launching of a model tax and customs center in Cairo, establishment of a new, modern port
at Ein Sokhna).

30.
During the CAS period the GOE took other measures designed to promote exports,
including establishment of a Ministry of Foreign Trade and enactment of laws on Special
Economic (export-processing) Zones and Export Promotion. The latter includes establishment of
an Export Promotion Fund, improved machinery for executing the duty drawback and tax rebate
systems, and provisions to combat extra-legal levies on foreign traders.

49

31.
Tax reform. The CAS cites a joint GOE/Bank task force report on tax policy and
administration, recommending management information systems to monitor performance in all
major functions of revenue collection, starting with duty drawback and sales tax rebates for
exports. With respect to the tax code, the report suggested abolishing most tax incentives in order
to reduce distortions, limit discretion and facilitate tax administration. A major bill designed to
limit arbitrary tax assessment and lower the tax burden on businesses was scheduled for
submission to Parliament in early 2004.
32.
Subsidies. The CAS describes the present system of food subsidies, amounting to roughly
1.7 percent of GDP and available to poor and non-poor alike, as an inefficient mode of social
protection, and recommends more explicit targeting to the poor. However the GOE questions the
administrative feasibility of such a reform, and has taken no steps in this direction. Electricity
tariffs, set by Cabinet decree, have not changed since 1994, meaning a growing implicit subsidy
over the past nearly ten years. In opportunity cost terms (world market prices), petroleum
products likewise embody a substantial implicit subsidy. The total for electric power and
petroleum together is estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP. Reform is reported to be under discussion,
but had not been implemented as of the date of this report.
33.
Privatization. Privatization slowed during FY01, compared with FYs ’95 through 2000,
when some 130 enterprises with assets worth about US$3.8 billion were privatized.
Notwithstanding this effort, in 2000 the public sector still accounted for around 30 percent of
economic activity. Subsequent data13 show that FY01 saw only 13 companies privatized,
compared with the preceding 4-year average of 29, with proceeds equaling only 41 percent of that
average. According to the CAS, the GOE had indicated plans to divest most remaining enterprises
during the next 2-3 years (i.e. by FY04), privatizing the gas distribution network, and selling
public sector shares in joint venture insurance companies as well as 20 percent of Egypt Telecom.
In the event, only five companies were privatized in FY02, yielding merely 8 percent of FY01’s
already reduced proceeds.
34.
Reform of the commercial code and its application. The CAS calls for improvements in
Egypt’s legal system to facilitate investment and accelerate settlement of commercial disputes.
During the CAS period the GOE took several legislative initiatives, including adoption of laws on
intellectual property rights and labor and drafting of a competition policy law. Nonetheless, at the
end of the period, observers were noting the persistence of time delays in resolving commercial
cases: just over a third of cases filed in commercial courts are resolved, taking an average of six
years.
35.
Financial system reforms. The CAS noted the public sector’s continued dominance of the
financial sector through retention of the four main commercial banks and major insurance
companies, questions about the soundness of loan portfolios, and the GOE’s continued resort to
administrative controls in areas where modern economies rely more on market discipline. The
controls and lack of competition are blamed for the high cost and nonavailability of medium- and
long-term finance, especially to small and medium enterprises.
36.

IMF data on bank portfolio soundness as of March 2002 show non-performing loans at
nearly 17 percent of total loans, with only two-thirds covered by provisions.14 The CAS
characterizes the World Bank’s current access to financial sector data as “limited,” but notes that
13

50

the GOE is considering participation in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) with a
view to helping it better assess the sector’s vulnerabilities and development needs.

37.
An FSAP exercise was indeed launched and a report issued at the end of 2002. Several
facets of the action plan it recommended were implemented during FY03-04. A new Banking
Law enhances CBE independence. Prudential regulation was strengthened through regulations
concerning insider lending. The CBE and banks worked to develop an automated credit risk
information system (CRIS). In the area of monetary policy, the CBE established a separate
monetary policy unit and introduced new open market operations, including deposit windows. A
Real Estate Finance Law, enacted at the start of the CAS period, was expected eventually to
promote housing affordability by lengthening amortization periods and reducing effective interest
rates. Later in the CAS period the Capital Market Law was modified to support emergence of a
mortgage market. An Anti-Money Laundering Law was adopted, with independent enforcement
machinery. No major changes were made in the banking and insurance sectors with respect to
ownership; however, new management was introduced at the four major public sector banks in
2002/03.
38.
Foreign borrowing policy. The CAS expresses concern that overly cautious borrowing
policy, designed to keep foreign debt within prudent limits, could hold capital inflow below levels
necessary to finance an investment rate consistent with Egypt’s 7 percent growth target. The view
is expressed that the current policy of requiring a minimum 40 percent grant element in individual
loans is overly restrictive, and should rather be applied at an aggregate level. In the event, it
appears that the GOE has applied the policy rather selectively during the CAS period. At the start
of the period (July 2001) it floated a $1.5 billion Eurobond, and in June 2003 it formally applied
to the World Bank for a $350 million Airports Development loan (see below). At the end of
FY03, foreign debt in dollar terms was about 8 percent above its level at the start of the period,
largely due to the dollar’s depreciation. Notwithstanding, at one-third of GDP, foreign debt
remains at a modest level, as does the debt service ratio of roughly 10 percent.
39.
As indicated previously, GDP growth during the CAS period diverged sharply from the
GOE’s 7 percent target, although this cannot be blamed solely on failure to attract greater capital
inflow for investment. Towards the end of the CAS period, in FY04, signs of an economic
recovery began to appear. Business confidence appeared to be firming up, and both non-oil
exports and import-competing domestic production were responding, with a predictable lag, to
the pound’s depreciation. Tourism arrivals reached record levels, and the nascent natural gas
industry was making solid progress. GDP growth was projected in the 3½-4 percent range, up
from FY03’s 2.5 percent.
40.

The outcomes of the various triggers can be summarized as follows:

41.
Macroeconomic policies. Consistent with the base case scenario, monetary and exchange
rate policies improved. Controls in these areas were not removed, but cannot be said to have
deepened according to the low-case scenario. On the other hand, there was no significant move
towards fiscal sustainability; far from declining after 2001, the deficit reached -6.4 percent in
FY03, before declining to roughly -5.5 percent in FY04.
42.
Trade policy. Consistent with the base- and high-case scenarios, tariff surcharges were
eliminated and the average unweighted tariff was reduced below 20 percent. The float of the
exchange rate was a pro-trade measure not foreseen in the CAS, although partially offset by the
interventions described above.

51

43.
Financial sector reform. Here the base-case scenario seems to fit. The FSAP was
completed and some reforms (see above) were undertaken. No commercial bank was privatized
as envisaged in the high-case scenario, although at the end of the CAS period discussions were
underway between the GOE and the Bank, IMF and USAID on initiating the privatization
process.
44.
Policy dialogue. Here the high-case scenario seems to fit. The Poverty and Financial
Sector Assessments were completed (see below), and serious policy dialogue occurred in the
course of negotiations over the Policy-Based Loan as well as in contacts between GOE
ministerial and Bank vice-presidential levels.
45.
Bank portfolio management. One year into the CAS period, five out of 18 projects or 28
percent were in the problem category. Strenuous efforts following a Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) in May 2002 improved performance to the point where, as the CAS
period drew to a close, only one out of 13 then active projects, or 8 percent, still fell in that
category. The three new projects becoming effective by the time of writing, Higher Education
Enhancement, Skills Development, and 2nd Matruh Resource Management, attained effectiveness
in three, six and ten months, respectively, averaging just over six months. Thus, portfolio
management met the two high-case triggers cited in Table 1.
46.
In summary, the situation as it evolved contained elements corresponding to some of the
triggers of all three scenarios.
New Bank loans during the CAS period
47.
Sectoral focus. The CAS signals the Bank’s intent to focus on three types of interventions
during FYs 02-04:
•

Interventions that support higher and sustained growth. The latter involves supporting
macroeconomic stability, phased restructuring of the bank and corporate sectors, and
improved infrastructure for greater competitiveness. Bank participation in this category
was to be limited because of heavy USAID/EU involvement.

•

Targeted interventions for poverty reduction. Defined as activities in basic education and
health; social protection/safety net; and rural poverty.

•

Interventions with indirect poverty reduction impact. Defined as activities that generate
benefits for the poor by promoting broad-based growth, developing poor areas, initiating
dialogue on governance and community development, and building effective
institutions.

48.
Projected volume of activity. As shown in Table 2, the CAS base-case lending program
foresaw eight new projects, totaling $500 million. For the high case, total lending over three
years was foreseen at around US$1.5 billion, half of it to take the form of quick-disbursing loans.
This was described as presupposing sustained dialogue between the GOE and the Bank on the
key structural issues. For the low case, it was foreseen that total new lending would be limited to
around US$100 million for one or two social sector projects.

In the event, four new loans for a total of $403 million have already been or are
scheduled to be approved during the CAS period. Table 3 lists those four plus two loans
scheduled for approval in FY05. Comparison of Tables 2 and 3 shows that one of the four CASperiod loans, Airports Development, was not foreseen explicitly in the CAS. The current
projection of 13 active projects at the end of FY04 is one less than the CAS base-case scenario.
Four projects will have closed during FY02-04, and two more are scheduled to close in FY04, but
extensions are anticipated. The bottom line is that five out of the eight projects foreseen for
FY02-04 in the base-case scenario are expected to be approved by end-FY05, albeit two for
substantially lesser amounts. The Agricultural Exports project is being redesigned, and Health
Sector II is still possible further down the road, depending on the outcome of a redesigned Health
Sector I.

Application of sectoral focus criteria during CAS period
The lending program realized during the CAS period will not meet a rigid interpretation
50.
of the sectoral foci outlined in the CAS, but there are sound reasons for this:

53

•

The Bank's lending to Egypt is modest compared to the volume of overseas development
assistance (ODA) to Egypt from the U.S. and EU.15 Moreover, its market-based terms
cannot compete with grant funding from those two sources and other development
partners. However, experience during the CAS period shows that the GOE appreciates
the Bank’s role more as a critical partner mobilizing knowledge and experience to
pioneer efforts in challenging areas, than as a source of funds. For example, at the GOE’s
request, the Bank is initiating and leading efforts in Egypt to enhance Early Childhood
Development, and to restore private sector participation in provision of infrastructure
services by introducing private management of airport services.

•

The CAS sectoral focus of support for “sustained growth” is so broad as to accommodate
a great variety of interventions. Project analysis in the Bank has shown a close linkage
between expansion of Cairo and Sharm El Sheikh airports and development of tourism.

•

The CAS’ Private Sector Strategy annex states, “The Bank Group has and can continue to
play a role in the infrastructure area, and increasingly in the private provision of
infrastructure. Areas for Bank and IFC activity include…ports and airports.” GOE and
Bank perceptions agree that, given the current political backdrop, private foreign capital
is not available in significant amounts for investments such as the Airports Development
Project. The Bank’s acceptance of the airport project conforms to the above
supplemental selection criteria. There is no question of the GOE’s unequivocal
commitment. While the Bank has not done many recent airport projects, there is likewise
no question of its comparative advantage in managing international tendering and
implementation of infrastructure projects on this scale.

•

As noted above, two of the CAS-listed projects not approved during FY02-04 (Irrigation)
have merely been postponed to FY05. Many factors induce changes in the phasing of
planned projects.

•

Special factors apply to two of the Table 2 projects that no longer appear in the lending
program. USAID offered cheaper funds for the Information Infrastructure project, and the
Agricultural Exports project turned out not to meet the criterion of serious government
commitment, although the GOE is supporting design of a project with similar objectives
(West Delta Development), planned for FY05.

51.

Admittedly, the number of new loan projects during FY02-04 that could be termed
“targeted interventions for poverty reduction” is limited to one, namely Matruh Resources
Management II, which also satisfies three criteria under the sectoral heading “interventions with
indirect poverty reduction impact,” namely: developing poor areas, initiating dialogue on
governance and community development, and building effective institutions. Conversely all four
new FY02-04 projects target “broad-based growth,” which makes the CAS’ “indirect poverty
reduction” heading a rather vague demarcation of sectoral priorities.

15

According to OECD/DAC, ODA disbursements to Egypt in 2000-01 averaged $643 million p.a. for the
U.S., and $392 million for EU members together. World Bank data show average annual IBRD/IDA
disbursements in FY00-01 of $62 million.

54

V. Cluster 1: Promotion of Economic Growth through Structural Reform

Evolution of Bank/GOE policy dialogue
52.
In discussing what did and did not work under the previous CAS,16 the 2001 document
cites two sectors where the Bank’s role in policy dialogue was “greatly appreciated,” namely
human resource development and rural development. Conversely, it refers to a “constrained
relationship” associated with policy dialogue that is variously described as “weak,”
“circumscribed,” and “marginal” in four critical areas, namely: nature and incidence of poverty in
Egypt; assessment of the financial sector, desirable in order to help the GOE better understand,
and respond to, weaknesses of the system and its vulnerability to economic shocks; export push
and private sector development.

53.

As noted above, the CAS cites development of “sustained policy dialogue” between the
GOE and the Bank as both a benchmark for overall Bank involvement in Egypt during FY02-04
and a trigger for the lending program. As indicated below and in Section II, implementation for
the first time of joint studies on poverty (see Section II) and the financial sector laid the
groundwork for sustained policy dialogue in those areas.

54.
Financial sector assessment. The financial sector study, carried out during April-June
2002, focused on banking, where four state-owned commercial banks hold 51 percent of system
assets, and the Government has shares in most of the 50+ smaller banks. According to the study,
state dominance of the sector has restrained competition and retarded financial sector deepening.
The state banks’ operations lack cost-effectiveness and their portfolios reveal weaknesses. The
study’s conclusion: to attract private buyers, substantial public funds would have to be injected
into them.
55.
Major recommendations include: audits of the state banks to assess loan recoverability;
resumed privatization of joint ventures; early steps towards privatizing the state-owned banks;
allowing market-determined interest rates in primary auctions; restructuring of government
borrowing plans; gradual lowering of reserve requirements and remuneration of reserves;
strengthening the Capital Market Authority to improve corporate governance and protect
investors; privatization of the insurance industry; review of the structure and financing of social
security; establishment of a credit registry; legislative-judicial reform to facilitate collection of
collateral and protect creditor rights; and revenue-neutral tax reform for the financial sector.
56.
Dialogue in context of proposed Policy-Based Loan. In January 2002 the GOE, calling
attention to the impact of the September 11, 2001, events on the Egyptian economy, formally
applied for a $500 million PBL. Over the next two years this led to high-level dialogue touching
on all major facets of development policy, including the above four topics.
57.
A draft Letter of Development Policy underlying the discussions, tabled in FY03,
described as the foremost aim of Egypt’s reform strategy to create an environment for sustainable
economic growth, overall stability and social development. This would enhance private,
particularly foreign, investment, thereby raising productivity, competitiveness and employment.
Five areas are listed as fundamental to achievement of this goal: the macroeconomic framework,
the business climate, the trade regime, the financial sector and social safety nets. The document
describes reform measures already introduced by the GOE and discusses their implementation

16

2001 CAS, Box B, p. 20.

55

and enhancement. Key issues arising in these areas and featuring in the Bank/GOE dialogue can
be summarized as follows:
•

Macroeconomic framework. Management of the floating exchange rate; setting of
money supply and inflation targets; revenue enhancement and expenditure control
measures to reduce the budget deficit, including the impact of external tariff reform;
enhanced transparency through public release of budget data.

•

Business climate. Rationalizing business taxation, inter alia by reducing marginal tad
rates, phasing out exemptions; lowering business costs through reform of labor law;
promoting the real estate market by facilitating mortgage financing; reform of company
registration, commercial adjudication and insolvency; improving the business
environment for SMEs.

•

Trade policy. Promotion of exports, inter alia through a new financial facility and
establishment of special economic zones; customs modernization based on a new
customs law; implementation of a new tariff structure, reducing the number of tariff
bands, regularizing exemptions and lowering the average tariff rate; reform of the import
inspection regime.

•

Financial sector modernization. Enhancing the soundness and competitiveness of the
banking sector, including sale of government shares in joint ventures, risk assessment of
the four state-owned banks and their eventual privatization; regularizing taxation of
financial intermediaries and transactions; new legislation on accounting and auditing of
capital market entities.

•

Social safety nets. Improved targeting of the poor in order to concentrate subsidies that
now benefit poor and the nonpoor alike.

58.
Tariff reform. An avenue of reform that is encountering resistance among the Bank’s
GOE discussion partners is modification of the tariff structure. Two main concerns underlie this
position: (i) the fiscal consequences of uncompensated loss of tariff revenue; and (ii) the
unemployment consequences of reduced protection for Egyptian industry. Resolution of the first
concern depends less on technical information than on whether Cabinet and Parliament can be
persuaded to adopt compensating revenue/expenditure control measures with non-neutral impact,
i.e. that will unavoidably make some elements in society worse off.
59.

As regards the issue of unemployment, however, it is inevitable that the GOE would be
concerned about a reform that promises to intensify foreign competition, particularly for Egypt’s
textile and garment industries. There is reason to expect the Government to welcome a joint study
of the net employment impact of lower tariffs in certain industries and options for relocating
affected workers. A showing that job losses in some branches could be compensated by gains in
others would strengthen the Bank’s hand in pushing for tariff changes that would on balance
increase the Egyptian economy’s openness and integration with world markets.

Evaluation of the Bank’s performance
60.
During the CAS period, the Bank provided a swift response to the GOE’s applications for
two large growth-oriented loans, those for airports and policy reform, involving a total
commitment of over $800 million (of which the African Development Bank tentatively agreed to
share half the cost of the $500 million PBL). In its negotiating posture vis-à-vis the PBL, the
Bank recognized policy reforms recently undertaken or currently in course, and engaged the GOE
in constructive discussion about further measures to stimulate investment, increase the Egyptian
56

economy’s competitiveness and enhance incentives for local producers. Ultimately, an improved
balance of payments and GOE reticence vis-à-vis some of the proposed measures led the PBL to
be dropped.

61.
In regard to economic and sector work (ESW), with GOE participation the Bank executed
a major study of the financial sector (FSAP), underpinning discussions on that component of the
PBL reform package. Solid analytic work, in the form of a report done in 2000 on export
development options, was also available to underpin the trade reform proposals.
Key findings for the next CAS (FY2006-09)
62.
The forthcoming CAS period will witness implementation of the airport loan and the
culmination of discussions related to structural reforms in the financial, trade, tax and regulatory
policy areas. The former will contribute directly to GDP via growth of Egypt’s tourism and
transport sectors, as well as indirectly by lowering transaction costs for other sectors.
63.
Drawing lessons from the Bank’s interaction with the GOE on structural reform issues
during FY02-04 is a more complicated matter. In the PBL negotiations hitherto the Bank
proposed a series of reforms designed to speed the growth of exports, employment and GDP over
the long run. However, the government is clearly worried about the risk of economic and political
shocks those reforms could cause in the short run. Clearly there is a need for the two sides to
engage in a deeper dialogue about how Egypt can escape the relative stagnation in which the
economy found itself at the end of the CAS period. How can the country best take advantage of
the disappearance of trade barriers between it and the European Union, scheduled to culminate in
free trade by 2012? What steps can it take to retrain and relocate workers who will be displaced
as the economy opens further? And, further, what lessons does financial liberalization in other
countries offer Egypt about the resulting stimulus to the economy? How can the nonpoor segment
of the population be weaned from energy and food subsidies that burden the public finances and
impede programs to help the poor? What will be the macro impact of rising agricultural
productivity as management of tertiary irrigation canals is decentralized? In the longer run, what
will be the impact of a more decentralized system of higher education, reoriented towards
producing skills for the knowledge-based economy? Answering these questions collaboratively
with the Bank’s Egyptian partners calls for greatly expended investment in economic and sector
work during the next CAS period.
VI. Cluster 2: Development of Agriculture and Water Resources
Previous Bank involvement in/focus on agriculture & water

64.

During FY02-04 this cluster had two main components, comprising: irrigation, where the
Bank has been Egypt’s principal external partner for three decades, operating via parallel loans to
the sector’s three main branches—water delivery, pumping and drainage; and community-based
rural development and natural resource management in three regions.

65.
The CAS cites the preliminary (July 2000) report of a sector review on agricultural
exports, whose final report appeared in December 2001. The review led to design of a $40 million
loan project to promote horticulture exports, especially in the context of Egypt’s agreement with
the EU. The project was dropped for lack of sufficient GOE commitment, but a similar project,
West Delta Development, is being prepared for FY05, with much stronger support from the
authorities.

57

Implementation of pre-CAS loans
66.
Bank evaluators of CAS-period implementation of the three ongoing irrigation sector
loans have rated it as satisfactory. These are Irrigation Improvement ($80 million, 2/3 IDA, 1/3
IBRD; approved in FY95), National Drainage II ($50 million, 100 percent IBRD, FY00), and
Pumping Station Rehabilitation III ($120 million, 100 percent IBRD, FY99). At end-2003, 44
percent of the loan amounts had been disbursed.
67.
The water delivery component (Irrigation Improvement) has focused for some time on
institutional aspects of the sector, based on recognition of the advantages of bringing water users’
associations into the allocation and pricing of water at the tertiary canal level.
68.

Two of the community-based rural development projects encompassed East Delta, where
the Bank lent to raise productivity, including nonfarm income, of 20,000 poor families recently
settled on reclaimed (formerly saline) land; and Sohag, Upper Egypt, where a Bank loan is
financing credit and enabling local authorities to prepare, implement and manage infrastructure
projects and services. The third region is Matruh, in the western coastal drylands, where a loan
completed at the start of the CAS period supported natural resource management and community
participation among Bedouins and a follow-on project was approved in March 2003.

69.
A seventh project in the agricultural sector was designed to channel the bulk of its
$175m. value into rural credit through the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural
Credit (PBDAC), a state-owned institution that is the main financial intermediary in rural Egypt.
Problems arising in implementing this combined loan/credit led to a joint Bank-GOE decision to
close the project in early 2004.
Evaluation of Bank performance
70.

During the CAS period the Bank came to realize that its long-time support for traditional
ways of doing business in Egypt’s irrigation sector was perpetuating inefficiency and leaving
downstream irrigators exposed to health hazards. The question may be asked whether this
realization could have come sooner, leading to better design of the lending operations underway
during the CAS. The opposing argument is that, ancient modus operandi being as entrenched as
they are, one must allow time to nudge the bureaucracy towards modern departures. The new
integrated lending operation bids fair to be a substantial improvement over its predecessors.

Key findings for the next CAS
71.
Section III above mentioned growing concern with low water productivity of Egypt’s
irrigated agriculture, and harm to downstream farm families caused by upstream pollution of the
Nile. Low productivity means that irrigated agriculture is receiving large implicit subsidies.
Traditionally, Egyptian governments have considered it their responsibility to provide water.
However, it has become clear that management of distribution by a cumbersome bureaucracy
leads to waste. Farmers are coming to realize that control by themselves, through water users’
associations (WUAs), can bring substantial efficiencies. Moreover, Nile Delta farmers are turning
increasingly to horticulture, and prefer pressurized networks, managed individually, over
traditional canals.
72.
Meanwhile the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation is recognizing the need for
cost recovery. The first handover of tertiary canals to WUAs is scheduled for late FY04. Water
58

boards are being established to manage the secondary canals. A key issue for the new CAS is how
well these bodies will function, and how willing the bureaucracy will be to cede its control.

73.
On the mechanical side, the GOE has sought to preserve the monopoly of pump supply
long enjoyed by a state-owned factory in Helwan. However, this enterprise has not been able to
meet demand, helping to make P.S. Rehab. III the slowest disbursing of the three irrigation loans
(only 29 percent in 42 months since effectiveness). Pressure is rising to allow the private sector
into the industry.
74.

As regards pollution control, at present, upstream towns have little incentive to treat their
effluents even when treatment facilities are available. The growing health hazards inflicted on
Delta households by these effluents can only be controlled by motivating riparian communities to
treat them.

75.
Growing awareness, on the part of both the GOE and the Bank, of the confluence of
issues of irrigation and drainage on the one hand, and rural water and sanitation on the other,
underlies the ongoing ESW effort in the latter field, designed to lead to a complementary lending
operation in the new CAS period.
76.

Experience in rural finance over the past decade, culminating in recent cancellation of the
PBDAC credit/loan, indicates that strong GOE commitment to policy change is a prerequisite for
future Bank involvement in publicly owned agricultural banks. In the meantime, lending to small
businesses may be included in rural development operations.

77.
The new West Delta project will provide value added and opportunities for implementing
the Bank agenda in promoting private ownership and stakeholder participation, particularly in
managing water resources.
VII.

Cluster 3: Development of Education

Previous Bank involvement in education

78.

Through interaction with Egypt’s two education ministries since the early 1990s,
involving technical support of the Government’s 20-year Education Sector Strategic Framework
(1999-2019) and culminating in the education sector review completed in 2002, the Bank has
become a major partner in developing a comprehensive strategy for education reform at all levels.
A Basic Education Enhancement project, approved in 1993, financed school construction in rural
as well as urban areas and developed an education management information system. Starting in
1997 an Education Enhancement Program (EEP) targeted further improvement in access to basic
education as well as quality and efficiency.

Implementation of pre-CAS loans
79.

The CAS period saw continued implementation of three projects from the 1990s. Both
the Basic Education Improvement and Education Enhancement Projects continued reducing
gender and regional disparities in access through community participation and subsidies to poor
families. The EEP supported massive training (over 500,000 teachers and administrators) on
topics such as effective teaching techniques and computer literacy. It also picked up on a key
recommendation of the Education Sector Survey (see below) concerning reform of the
examination system, traditionally based on one-time, all-for-nothing tests of students’
memorization. Over 100,000 teachers and inspectors were trained in comprehensive, cumulative

59

evaluation. The impact of the various training programs on teacher classroom behavior and
student outcomes remains to be assessed. In collaboration with other donors, the EEP also
supported a School Improvement Program aimed at instituting capacity in some 2,500 schools to
take local initiative in implementing reforms.

80.

A Secondary Education Enhancement Program, becoming effective in mid-2000,
converted outdated vocational schools to general secondary schools, trained mathematics and
science teachers in computer technology, and surveyed businesses and educationists to develop
guidelines for curricular reform.

New loans
81.
Both education loans approved during the CAS period emphasized quality—for example,
creation of a quality assurance program for universities was a central component of the Higher
Education Enhancement Project. This project, its implementation beginning only 14 months
before the end of the period, has already encouraged some university departments to undertake
self-evaluation, laying a foundation for a national quality assurance system.
82.
Structural reform involving consolidation of middle technical institutes into technical
colleges is underway. The Skills Development Project, which became effective in early 2004, is
expected to strengthen the capacity of training institutes to provide training in selected sectors.
Education sector review

83.
This study, not mentioned in the 2001 CAS, was conducted by the Bank MNA (Middle
East and North Africa) region’s Human Development Group in cooperation with Egypt’s
Ministry of Education. Reporting in October 2002, it noted real progress in narrowing regional
and reducing gender disparities, reducing class size, eliminating multiple shifts, increasing class
instructional time, and introducing technology in the classroom. While the share of education in
Government expenditure has increased from 12 percent in 1991 to about 20 percent, and nearly
all children have access to basic education, the poor continue to face severe obstacles in educating
their children.
84.

The report identified five key challenges facing Egypt’s education reform efforts, namely

to:
•

prepare Egypt’s youth for the modern, knowledge-based economy through quality
improvements at all levels of schooling, from primary through university;

•

strengthen management of educational institutions by decentralizing decisions and
promoting accountability;

•

increase efficiency by reducing over-staffing and giving higher education managers
increased autonomy and accountability;

•

improve equity by preparing children of the poor to begin school and reducing private
costs of education to them;

•

reduce regulatory barriers to redeploying resources in the education system.

85.
The report provided impetus for a national debate that culminated in a resolution of the
ruling party to create a National Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency (NQAAA),
independent of the education ministries that would monitor all levels of the educational system
and establish national standards for teachers, administrators, students, the community and the
school environment.
60

Report on Early Childhood Education
86.

In September 2002 the Bank’s Human Development Sector, in cooperation with Egypt’s
Ministry of Education, produced a report entitled Egypt: Strategic Options for Early Childhood
Education, laying the groundwork for a $40 million loan foreseen for FY05. The study proposes
an approach to early childhood education (ECE) that targets the poor. It discusses options for
increasing numbers and quality of public and private kindergartens (KGs), while stimulating
demand for KG education via incentives and heightened parental awareness. Proposals are
advanced for strengthening ECE coordination and management, improving access to public KGs,
transforming nurseries currently managed by another ministry into KGs, training KG teachers,
and enhancing monitoring and evaluation. With the ECE loan, the Bank’s reach will extend to the
entire educational pyramid, making a significant contribution at each level of the Egyptian
education system.
Evaluation of Bank performance

87.
During the CAS period the Bank correctly recognized that it could enhance its
contribution to development of Egypt’s education sector by shifting the earlier focus on increased
access to schooling, towards improvement of student learning. The first of two new loans, Higher
Education Enhancement, targets legislative reform, institutional restructuring, establishment of
independent quality assurance mechanisms, and monitoring systems. The second project, Skills
Development, is a pilot activity that will focus on translating employers’ manpower needs into
appropriate training.
88.
In addition, through its review of Early Childhood Education and development of a
project in that area, the Bank will help Egypt redress the imbalance represented by deficiencies in
the preparation of disadvantaged children to enter the formal education system.
Key findings for the next CAS
89.

The Bank’s long involvement in Egypt’s education sector and the two surveys carried out
during the CAS period suggest that the sector is still a long way from generating human resources
of the quality needed to make Egypt competitive in the international knowledge-based economy.
The next CAS needs to consider how the Bank can provide a critical mass of support for reforms
that will achieve that objective within the next generation, while making a significant contribution
to reducing poverty.

90.
Detailed survey findings reveal a need for numerous reform measures. To improve
quality, the existing examination system needs to be replaced with continuous, comprehensive
evaluation. Other recommendations of the Education Sector Survey include creating a LearningInnovations Fund managed by the school council; developing teacher capacity in new curriculum,
teaching practices, and technology use; continued introduction of new technology in the
classroom; and establishment of a competitive fund to foster change in higher education. On the
management side, the study finds a need to involve local communities and school staff in the
education process; inform schools about teaching practices and student learning outcomes;
decentralize decision-making authority to school managers; and train managers to use EMIS.

61

91.
Increasing efficiency requires that funding of higher education be rationalized, and
quality assurance mechanisms introduced; enrollments in public higher education institutions
likewise need to be rationalized, and private provision and open universities encouraged; and
excess teachers and administrators have to be redeployed and retrained. A provisional five-year
target has been set for the NQAAA to extend its monitoring to the entire system.
92.
On the side of equity, Early Childhood Education programs must be expanded in
disadvantaged areas; subsidies need to be targeted on the poor to reduce the private costs of
schooling; parent education programs are needed to improve child development in the home; and
the primary school-leaving examination should be replaced by continuous assessment.
VIII.

Cluster 4: Development of Health and Social Services

Previous Bank involvement in/focus on health and social services

93.
At the outset of the CAS period, the Bank was involved in five projects in this sector,
Schistosomiasis Control, Health Sector, Population, Social Fund III and Social Protection
Initiative. Schistosomiasis Control closed early in the period. As the Bank’s flagship activity in
the sector, Health Sector’s primary aim was to help the GOE establish a model of social insurance
to finance primary health care. Through the Population project the Bank sought to help the GOE
raise public awareness of the costs of uncontrolled population growth.
Implementation of pre-CAS loans
Schistosomiasis Control. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on this 1992
94.
IDA credit, which closed in September 2002, gave it an overall satisfactory rating.17 The project
helped the National Schistosomiasis Control Program (NSCP) achieve national coverage,
including newly reclaimed areas, and become integrated with existing health service delivery
systems. The NSCP now covers Egypt’s entire rural population of 35 million people, and
prevalence of the disease has decreased to less than 5 percent of the population from around 36
percent in 1983. However, the report rated as unsatisfactory achievement of a project objective
involving support of operational research and strengthening management of the responsible
health ministry department.

95.
Health Sector. This 1998 IDA credit targeted universal insurance coverage for primary
health care services in three pilot governorates. In late 2002 the ruling party’s health policy
committee identified “extending health insurance coverage” as one of the Government’s two key
objectives in the sector. For reasons described below under the health sector review, the pilot
insurance model did not succeed. By end-2003, only 7 percent of the credit had been disbursed.
The focus of the project has now shifted to improvement of health services, including
rationalization of infrastructure. In collaboration with the GOE, a Bank review team was
scheduled to develop a revised operating plan in early 2004. The Government has requested a
two-year extension of the June 2004 closing date.
96.
Population. Implementation of this 1996 project, designed to increase demand for family
planning services, has also been slow. Just over one-third of the IDA credit had been disbursed by
the scheduled end-2003 closing date. However, the government’s concern over rapid population
increase, currently 1.9 percent,18 has grown. “Managing population growth” was the second key
objective identified by the ruling party committee. In close cooperation with several public

62

agencies and NGOs, the project is highlighting public awareness and targeting vulnerable and
hard-to-reach population groups. In view of the renewed GOE focus on population issues and
recent progress in implementation, the project was extended at end-2003.

97.
Social Fund III. This 1999 IDA credit, third in a series starting in the early 1990s, focuses
on creating jobs and providing community infrastructure and services through labor-intensive
works. It is being implemented in partnership with local authorities, communities and the private
sector. A gender component supports female involvement in the private sector. By end-2003, a
year before closing, just over one-fifth of the $50 million credit had been disbursed. The ICR for
the previous credit (Social Fund II) described the Fund’s sustainability as being at risk.
98.
Social Protection Initiative. This 1999 $5 million IDA-funded pilot project targets poor
children with disabilities or at risk of street life. It was designed to develop new strategies for
integrated delivery of services through multidisciplinary and inter-agency cooperation. As of end2003, also one year before scheduled closing, disbursements amounted to just over 10 percent.
New loans
99.
No new loans were approved in this sector during the CAS period. As shown in Table 2,
the CAS anticipated commitment of a $100 million Health Sector Reform II loan during FY04.
However, as indicated above, implementation of Health Sector I has been delayed, and
preparation of a new loan will have to await establishment of a viable model for health care
financing.
Health sector reform and financing review

100. The Bank’s MNA Human Development Group prepared this review in 2002-03. It
focused on lessons of the Health Sector Project, designed to help Egypt’s 1997 Health Sector
Reform Program (HSRP) integrate the sector’s fragmented financing into a single National
Health Insurance Fund.
101.

A pilot effort, the project sought to integrate delivery and financing of primary health
care (PHC) in three governorates with high infant, child and maternal mortality rates. It
introduced a Family Health (FH) approach, providing integrated services under the same roof for
the entire family. The project succeeded in providing satisfactory PHC services, and introduced
two major innovations in service delivery: both physicians and patients valued the concept of
continuity of care and the unified medical record. Performance-based incentive systems were also
adopted for the first time in Egypt, increasing provider accountability to quality standards and
reform goals.

102. On the financing side, Family Health Funds (FHFs) were established at governorate level
to contract with providers for a package of essential services. They were originally conceived to
collect and hold insurance premia, but legislation restricting that function to a national Health
Insurance Organization was not modified.
103. As a result, instead of shifting the decrease in private spending to the public system as
envisioned, the project decreased households’ contribution to health care spending and increased
the government contribution. Unsustainable deficits resulted.

63

104. The report notes that (1) Egypt’s public and private health spending has more or less
doubled in real terms since 1995, outpacing economic growth and straining the government
budget, while (2) increased spending in a system with low technical and allocative efficiency has
resulted in poor value for the money. The study urges the GOE to address the FHFs’ institutional
set-up and governance and create an organizational framework integrating them into a provider
network. More broadly, it calls for a search for ways of bringing financial stability to the health
sector as a whole.
Evaluation of Bank performance

105. The question arises whether, based on experience of many other countries receiving Bank
assistance to develop a viable model for universal health insurance, the Health Sector project’s
designers could not better have foreseen the failure of the Family Health Funds, documented in
the foregoing review. In any case, the review shows conclusively that the FHF model was
doomed to failure. It is less successful in proposing viable alternatives. Given questions about the
sustainability of the HIO, it is not clear that the proposal to merge the FHFs into the HIO’s
purchasing division would yield superior results. It is to be hoped that the joint team charged with
preparing a revised operating plan for the project in late FY04 will be able to suggest more
promising alternatives to be tested with support from the credit balance.
Key findings for the next CAS
106. Since the model for PHC insurance tested in Health Sector I did not succeed, the
overarching issue for the next CAS is to propose at least one new model for testing, and to
establish preconditions for expenditure of Bank funds on it. One issue the model must face is that
of risk management. Whatever institution manages risks associated with health care must meet
appropriate prudential requirements, which never came into question for the pilot FHFs. Among
preconditions for Bank financing should be evidence of sufficient political support for a given
reform by way of necessary legislative changes. The FHFs could not operate as independent
entities because a Presidential decree was not forthcoming.
107.

Other issues arise in regard to the Population, Social Fund and Social Protection Initiative
components of the health and social sector portfolio. All three projects have been moving slowly.
What actions by the responsible institutions are required to accelerate execution?
IX. IFC Activity during the CAS Period

108.

At end-April 2001 (close to the start of the CAS period), IFC managed a portfolio of 19
projects with a total commitment, comprising loans, equity/quasi-equity, and guarantees, of
US$328 million. Participants in IFC's B-loan program had committed an additional US$305
million, split evenly between two power projects.

109.

Between July 2001 and March 2004 (three months before the end of the CAS period),
nine new projects were committed. Another three projects, with a total IFC contribution of $80
million, were approved by the Board in March 2004, and were expected to be committed by the
end of FY04. At end-February 2004, the committed portfolio stood at US$270 million, with
US$323 million in loans from participants. Investments are in a range of sectors including the
financial sector, infrastructure, SMEs, manufacturing, chemicals, and tourism.

64

110. In addition, IFC co-financed a five-year, US$20 million North Africa Enterprise
Development (NAED) facility, which opened an office in Cairo in October 2002. NAED signed
advisory service agreements with two local private banks in June-July 2003.
IFC's competitive position and strategy

111. IFC is subject to stiff competition (some of which is concessional) from local banks and
other sources, such as the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the
African Development Bank. At the same time, solid demand remains for IFC’s services. IFC is
selective in its approach to financing in Egypt. For example, IFC is interested in exploring
opportunities in the petrochemical sector. IFC also continues to play an important role in the
financial sector by setting up new institutions, providing credit enhancement, and technical
assistance.
112. The previous CAS described IFC as seeking additional investments in support of the
following priorities:
•
•

Developing private-financed infrastructure;
Providing support to the services sector, including tourism;

•

Supporting internationally competitive and export-oriented ventures;

•

Supporting the privatization effort through both advisory services and providing
financing to privatized ventures;

•

Providing support to SMEs;

•

Developing financial markets; and

•

Participating in building gas pipelines to export Egypt's large reserves.

IFC’s activities since the previous CAS have supported those goals:
•

In SMEs, IFC support through NAED (now PEP-MENA), included work with the
Egyptian banking sector on access to finance.

•

In the financial sector, IFC’s initiatives included technical assistance and institution
building with specific focus on housing finance and risk-sharing guarantee facilities. In
January 2004, IFC committed an investment in the Egyptian Housing Finance Company,
the country's first private sector housing bank.

•

In infrastructure, IFC obtained Board approval in March 2004 (and has since committed)
an investment in the multi-user container, bulk and general cargo terminals at El Sokhna
Port on the Red Sea.

•

IFC also received Board approval in March 2004 for the development of gas fields in
Egypt, in conjunction with two US and British companies, Merlon and Melrose.

•

IFC’s support to the services sector included an investment in Metro, in the supermarket
sector.

•

IFC invested in a number of companies with export markets, including SEKEM, an
organic producer of pharmaceuticals, Amerya, an auto parts manufacturer, and Lecico, a
maker of ceramic tiles.

•

Although IFC did not work on privatization during the CAS period, it hopes to be able to
support the efforts of the Government going forward.

65

X. MIGA Activity during the CAS Period

113.

MIGA provided its first guarantees in Egypt during the final year of the CAS period. At
the close of FY04, it had facilitated $1.8 million in foreign investment, and was close to signing
agreements for $35 million of coverage with respect to two waste management projects and an
LNG project. Several other preliminary applications were in the pipeline. On the technical
assistance front, MIGA has been working for some time with Egypt’s General Authority for
Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) and its Industrial Modernization Center (IMC) to establish an
autonomous Egyptian investment promotion program, which the European Commission has
offered to fund. The nature of MIGA’s future TA depends in part on whether the GOE agrees to
make the new agency independent of government, a decision which is yet to be made. If it is
favorable, MIGA will cooperate with the U.S. Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) to
build capacity for the agency.

114.

Investment opportunities in Egypt are included in MIGA’s on-line promotion services.
MIGA has also provided $79 million of coverage for Egyptian investors in Pakistan and Ghana.
XI. Analytical & Advisory Assistance, Capacity Building, and Other Nonlending Services
Analytical & Advisory Assistance (AAA)

115. The CAS foresaw a growing role of AAA and capacity building work in the Bank’s
program. The share of the Bank’s administrative budget allocated to such work was forecast to
increase. The AAA program was to feature two main components:
•

Core diagnostic work on poverty, public expenditure review, a financial sector
assessment, and gender analysis and mainstreaming, all four topics raised in the Social
and Structural Review completed just before the CAS period; and

•

Studies and activities giving an intellectual underpinning for Bank operations and
technical advice in human development, rural development and water management.

116. As noted earlier, the CAS put primary emphasis on analysis of poverty and the financial
sector, categorizing completion of substantive work in these two areas as a “benchmark for Bank
involvement” in Egypt.19 The document notes that the effectiveness of the Bank's AAA would be
reviewed towards the end of CAS period. To this end a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) team
visited Cairo in February 2004. Table 4 reproduces the team’s summary of 23 AAA tasks, costing
a total of $3.3 million.20

19

2001 CAS, p. 21.
It should be noted that the QAG team considered the Governorate Health Plan, item #7 in the table and
financed entirely by trust funds, to be misclassified as ESW. Exclusion of that study reduces total AAA
costs to $2.4 million.

117. The QAG team conducted individual assessments of eight new AAA tasks out of 23
completed during FY01-03, and revalidated three tasks assessed previously as part of regular
QAG ESW work. Box 1 summarizes the team’s assessment of the AAA program.
Core diagnoses

118. The studies on poverty, gender and the financial sector were summarized in Sections II
and IV above. Arabic translations of the poverty and gender reports were distributed publicly,
with wide press coverage. At the GOE’s request, the financial sector report is being treated as
confidential for the time being.
119. In many member countries the Bank carries out fiduciary diagnostic work in the form of
Country Financial Accountability Assessments (CFAAs) and Country Procurement Assessment
Reports (CPARs). A CFAA and a CPAR for Egypt were prepared and submitted to the authorities
in FY04.
120. June 2002 saw publication of a Bank-prepared report on the Economic Costs of
Environmental Degradation. This document was well received by both the authorities and
civil society, and is often quoted in the press. At the end of the CAS period, only the
public expenditure review (PER) remained to be undertaken, constituting a subject of

Box 2: Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Assessment of Bank’s AAA Work in Egypt, FY01-03
The QAG panel visiting Cairo in February 2004 gave an overall assessment of Satisfactory to the
Egypt AAA program. Out of six standard dimensions for QAG assessments, the panel cited five as
Satisfactory—Strategic Relevance, Internal Quality, Dialogue & Dissemination, Coherence & Integration,
and Bank Inputs & Processes—while Likely Impact was assessed as only Marginally satisfactory.
This latter assessment is described as arising more from an appreciation of the country context
than from the approach or scale of Bank efforts. The panel cites the GOE’s “gradualist and somewhat
reluctant approach to reform, with the pace of reform accelerating when socioeconomic conditions worsen
and slackening as soon as the situation becomes better.” Another factor is the Bank’s limited leverage,
arising from Egypt’s “geopolitical importance and the abundance of resources available at concessional
terms from other donors.”
The panel finds the likely impact of AAA work greater in sectoral areas, “particularly where there
is an existing domestic constituency or champions for reform, and more difficult in the core
macroeconomic, structural areas.” Sectors where a significant impact is expected include:
•
•

Education, where high-quality analytical work has helped a committed minister improve access to
education, establish national standards and enact other reforms; and
Poverty reduction, where the FY03 joint assessment has led another committed minister to seek
the Bank’s help in developing an action plan.

(The FY03 study on water sector work in Egypt was not included in the QAG panel’s sample of AAA
work; otherwise irrigated agriculture might have been mentioned as another sector where a positive impact
is likely.)
The panel regards a positive impact from trade sector AAA as less likely in the near term, specifically in
regard to:
•
•

Export promotion, where the foreign trade ministry has refrained from distributing the Bank’s
report; and
Agricultural exports, where from the outset the Bank did not succeed in interesting the agriculture
ministry in the study.

The financial sector is viewed as a special case, since the management of the Central Bank
changed after the FSAP was conducted and reticence vis-à-vis reforms proposed in the report has been
replaced by openness, as evidenced inter alia by the CBE’s recent establishment of a Banking Sector
Restructuring Committee. The panel sees eventual implementation of the FSAP’s recommendations as
generating demand both for Bank TA and a lending program.
Apart from education, poverty reduction and the financial sector, the report foresees a limited
impact of future AAA on Bank lending, rather it expects AAA work to “increasingly address knowledgesharing and capacity building needs.” To increase the impact of AAA on GOE development strategy, the
report calls for an “integrative, analytical document such as a Development Policy Review (DPR)” to help
“draw together in a coherent way the various policy issues facing the country and allow a more convincing
demonstration of the actions with the highest pay off.”

121. Agricultural exports. This sector review, whose preliminary (July 2000) report is cited in
the CAS, produced its final report in December 2001. The resulting $40 million loan project was
conceived to support promotion of horticulture exports, especially in the context of Egypt’s
agreement with the EU. As indicated above, the project as such was dropped, but another project
with similar objectives (West Delta Development) is in preparation.
Studies relating to future Bank operations

122.

Of the fields listed in the CAS for studies related to future Bank loan projects, work on
rural development and water management was undertaken during the CAS period and the
corresponding reports are expected before the new CAS period.
World Bank Institute activity

123.

In line with the CAS’ emphasis on knowledge transfer and capacity building in priority
areas, and following consultations by WBI with stakeholders including officials, donors, NGOs
and think tanks, during FY02-04 WBI focused its activities in Egypt on poverty alleviation,
environmental management, macroeconomic management, globalization and the investment
climate. The program included structured learning activities, policy services to the authorities,
and dialogue and dissemination vis-à-vis development practitioners and civil society, building on
the Bank’s economic and sector work (ESW) and AAA. To enhance program impact, a WBI
economist was assigned to the Bank’s Cairo office.

124.

Specific interventions, in coordination with MNA operations, included:

•

dialogue on the joint poverty assessment, involving Cabinet, journalists, NGO
representatives, academics and donors;

•

development debates via videoconferences involving Egyptian poverty experts, MNA
specialists and senior MNA managers;

•

structured learning activities on poverty assessment and monitoring; and

•

orientation of Egyptian counterparts to prepare an impact assessment of Egypt’s Social
Fund.

125. Promoting dissemination of MNA’s report on the Cost of Environmental Degradation,
WBI helped organize a national workshop in Cairo and is supporting follow-up studies and
capacity building on the cost of water degradation. Working with Egyptian NGOs, WBI also
supported capacity building and dissemination efforts in environmental monitoring.
126. In the fields of macroeconomic management, globalization, and investment climate, WBI
provided:
•

Policy services to the authorities, as well as a Macroeconomic Management and
Monetary Policy course, in support of the GOE’s January 2003 decision to float the
currency. WBI also delivered the first distance-learning macroeconomic management
course to the wider MNA region in collaboration with Egypt’s GDLN center;

•

capacity building programs on regulation of infrastructure services and infrastructure
finance;

69

•

in collaboration with the Bank’s OPCS, capacity building in monitoring and evaluation
skills for a pilot performance-budgeting program in several ministries; and

•

capacity building in trade facilitation.

127. Apart from the national program, Egyptian officials and development practitioners
participated in WBI regional knowledge and capacity building activities in trade, rural
development, health, education and social protection.
128.

New developments in implementing WBI activity in Egypt included:

•

New working relationships with Egyptian training and learning institutions (Cairo
University, Al-Ahram Center, GDLN, etc). For these relationships to have a sustainable
impact, these institutions’ administrative capacity needs to be strengthened.

•

WBI mobilized Egyptian experts and officials to transfer knowledge and practical
experience to officials in other MNA and African countries.

•

To support its activities, WBI was able to raise funds from local donor offices.

129.

130. A base survey for an impact assessment of WBI activities was conducted in FY03 in
cooperation with Cairo University’s Center for Developing Country Studies. The survey, based
on interviews with course participants and three focus group sessions, found the perceived
effectiveness to be 4.83 on a scale of 1-7, relatively high compared to other countries conducting
the same exercise. Activities were rated as effective in raising awareness/understanding of
development issues, refining existing knowledge, and encouraging networking, and least effective
in providing strategies/approaches to address the needs of Egypt and participants’ organizations.
Rating their activity highest were participants who prepared an action plan on the basis of their
course experience. Completion of the assessment in FY05 will help better focus WBI activities in
Egypt.

XII. Procedural Criteria and Targets in the 2001 CAS

131.

This section examines the degree of fulfillment of project selection criteria and targets for
program implementation, set forth in the CAS, that do not relate directly to choice of sectors of
activity.
Criteria and targets

132. Dropped and postponed loans. CAS benchmark No. 3 (Section IV above) calls for fewer
dropped projects and lower average cost of those dropped, to be aligned with the Bank average
during FY02-04.
133.

Supplemental selection criteria. After specifying three areas (Section IV above) for Bank
focus in FY02-04—support of higher education and growth, targeted interventions for poverty
reduction, and interventions with indirect poverty reduction impact—the CAS cites a need for
selectivity within those areas, leading to focus on interventions where:
•

The GOE’s commitment to projects is unequivocally strong;

•

The Bank has a long and positive experience (subsectors cited are water sector/irrigation
and human development);

•

The Bank can bring knowledge management and experience of other countries to guide
Egypt's policy reforms (singling out mortgage market development, information and
communications infrastructure, poverty and gender analysis, and community-based
development); and

•

The Bank can serve as a catalyst for mobilizing financing packages 2-3 times that of
Bank loans for well-designed and high priority projects.

134. Portfolio management targets. The CAS also lists five considerations intended to guide
loan portfolio management during FY02-04:
•

Closer management of closing dates;

•

Greater efforts by the GOE and Bank to reduce effectiveness delays;

•

Less resort to project management units (PMUs) to ensure sustainability of project
outcomes;

•

Closer cooperation with development partners having softer lending terms than the
Bank’s, to satisfy the GOE’s 40 percent grant element criterion; and

•

Efforts to dissuade the GOE from applying the 40 percent criterion on a project level.

•

Execution of the criteria and targets

135. Dropped and postponed loans. Eight of the nine projects in the CAS table of projected
loans—see Table 2 above—were foreseen for FY02-04 (the ninth project, Rural Water Sanitation,
was allocated to FY05). Three of the eight, Higher Education, Skills Development, and Natural
Resource Management (now labeled Matruh Resource Management II), will have been approved
during the CAS period. Skills Development was recast and reduced by almost 90 percent, from
$50 to $5.5 million, while Matruh RM II was reduced by 75 percent to $12.4 million. Three of
the nine projects, Early Childhood Development, Irrigation/Drainage Improvement and Rural

71

Water/Sanitation, now combined in Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management ($150
million), are in the pipeline for FY05.

136. In other words, only two of the nine CAS projects—Information Infrastructure and
Agricultural Exports—are no longer in the program. However, it would be incorrect to term them
“dropped”—in Bank terminology, a “dropped” project is one on which sizable administrative
resources have been spent in taking the project to an advanced stage of preparation. Less than
$50,000 was spent on Information Infrastructure, most of it in the form of technical assistance on
postal development, and preparation of Agricultural Exports was limited to a small exploratory
mission. Health Sector II remains in the pipeline for an undetermined date, as Health Sector I is
projected to be extended two years from June 2004. The forecast loan amounts for these three
projects totaled $150 million, or an average $50 million per loan.
137. This observation makes it possible to evaluate the outcome of CAS Benchmark No. 3.
According to the 2001 document, the 1997 CAS foresaw eleven IBRD/IDA operations totaling
$450-600 million. In the event, ten loans received Board approval, for a total of $580 million.
However, a number of these were not the same projects foreseen in the 1997 CAS, several of
which qualify as having been dropped. Thus, no projects qualify as having been “dropped” during
FY02-04, and the 2001 CAS benchmark was met.
Supplemental selection criteria

138. Degree of GOE commitment. If this is measured by relative interest shown at high
political levels, Airports Development comes out on top. However, in each of the other three
FY02-04 projects, the Bank is working with GOE counterparts for whom the Bank role is
facilitating activities in whose efficacy the local actors believe strongly. Indeed, it was in part
pursuit of this criterion that led the Bank to recast the Skills Development project from a $50
million effort based in a ministry whose devotion to the task was uncertain, to a $5.5 million pilot
project in a different ministry that is investing sizable resources of its own in the activity.
Mention should also be made of the Higher Education Enhancement Project’s attaining
effectiveness in just over three months, the second shortest period on record for Bank loan or
credit projects in Egypt.
139. The Bank’s comparative advantage. Of the two subsectors listed under supplemental
criterion (ii), irrigation is the subject of a major project scheduled for FY05, while human
development applies to the FY02-04 education and training projects. Criterion (iii), knowledge
management/best practices as applied to policy reform, applies to the policy dialogue discussed in
Section IV above, as well as to advice on mortgage market development provided in the FSAP,
the joint poverty and gender assessments, and community-based development as highlighted in
Matruh Resource Management II.
140.

The Bank’s catalytic role in mobilizing financing packages. Three projects may be cited

here:
•

Skills Development—parallel to the Bank’s $5.5 million intervention, which will focus
on the demand side (enhancing firms’ demand for trained workers), the European
Commission has prepared a EUR 33 million companion project focusing on improving
the quality of training;

72

•

Early Childhood Development—complementing the Bank’s projected $40 million loan,
scheduled for approval in FY05, Canadian CIDA has agreed to provide $10 million in
grant funds;

•

Integrated Irrigation Improvement—Germany’s GTZ and possibly at least one other
donor will participate in this project.

Portfolio management targets

141. Overall, considerable progress was achieved during the CAS period towards sharpening
the focus of Bank and GOE resources on current and emerging priorities. The two parties took
bold decisions to clean up the portfolio; relinquish unutilized resources, even on IDA terms; and
close slow-moving projects. Performance in regard to the individual CAS targets can be
summarized as follows:
142.

Management of closing dates. Five of the 19 projects active at the start of FY02 were
extended during the CAS period, namely Education Improvement (by one year); Basic Education
Enhancement, Irrigation Improvement and Social Fund III (two years); and Pollution Abatement
(18 months). In addition, two more projects—Health Sector Reform and Population—are
scheduled for extension during FY04. However the GOE agreed not to extend the Basic
Education project beyond end-’03 despite a significant undrawn credit balance, and has also
agreed to adhere to the end-’04 closing date for the Social Protection Initiative project regardless
of any then undrawn balance.

143. Timing of loan effectiveness. As indicated earlier, effectiveness of the first three loans
approved during the CAS period averaged just over six months. Effectiveness of the Airports
Development loan is expected even sooner. In the past, waiting for Parliamentary approval of
loans during the December-May session has lengthened the time required for effectiveness of
projects whose approval was not timed accordingly. The appointment in late 2001 of a Minister
of State for Foreign Affairs responsible for aid matters has accelerated the processing of foreign
loans in all stages.
144. Resort to project management units (PMUs). Such units are envisaged for all four FY0204 loan projects. The unit’s title varies among projects, but this is only a matter of semantics.
Higher Education Enhancement has already established its PMU, Skills Development is to have
one PMU each for its Bank and EU components. Second Matruh will use a project coordination
unit (PCU). In the Airports Development project, two project implementation units (PIUs) are
envisaged.
145. PMU recruitment experience has shown that the needed skills are not readily available in
the market, especially procurement and monitoring & evaluation skills. Thus far, concern over
financial accountability and efficient implementation of loan operations has outweighed the
longer-run sustainability objective, which is to integrate post-project activity with normal
ministry functions. The new CAS must address capacity building in the areas of procurement and
upgrading of local institutions.
146. The GOE’s 40 percent grant element criterion. In the Early Childhood Development
Project, CIDA’s agreement to provide 20 percent of the external financing on grant terms raised
the overall grant element to 40 percent. (In addition, CIDA funding of the project’s preparation
costs significantly increased its quality.) Co-financing of Matruh II by $17.8 million in grants
from IFAD and GEF raised that project’s grant element well above 40 percent

Annex 3: Private Sector Development Strategy
Introduction
Egypt needs higher economic growth in order to alleviate poverty, unemployment and
fiscal challenges. Such growth can only be sustainable if it comes about as a result of rising
private investment. The strategic challenge for the Government of Egypt (GOE) is to facilitate an
increase in private investment through improving the business climate and through making
complementary public investments. The present Government is cognizant of this need and has
announced measures as well as intentions to improve the investment climate through reforms in
finance, trade, taxation, and regulatory policy. It has also begun to consider ways to increase and
improve public infrastructure (in electricity, roads, telecommunications, ports, and education), in
part through new public investments and in part through facilitating private investment in relevant
areas.
World Bank Group activity in last CAS period
During FY2001-05, IBRD activity in the area of private sector development consisted
primarily of a loan in the amount of $350 million to help improve airport facilities in Cairo and
Sharm El-Sheikh (the Airport Development Project) and analytical and advisory activities
including a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), an Investment Climate Assessment
(ICA) and a workshop on private participation in infrastructure.
IFC has had an active pipeline in Egypt, with equity and loan investments in a number of
sectors including manufacturing, financial markets, gas production, and infrastructure. IFC has
committed a total of fifteen new investments since the last CAS in the following business lines:
phyto-pharmaceuticals & health products, organic textiles & foodstuffs; dairying, fruit juice
production and supermarket retailing and construction materials; sanitary ware & ceramic tiles;
automotive castings, notably brake calipers; acrylic fiber; housing finance; insurance and leasing.
IFC was also involved in the first seaport operated by the private sector with container, bulk and
general cargo terminals. Execution of existing commitments has proceeded apace. On the
technical assistance front, IFC co-financed a North Africa Enterprise Development Facility
(NAED) which has been superseded by IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership for the Middle East
and North Africa (PEP-MENA). The focus of this technical assistance in Egypt has been on
access to finance, access to business services and support for improvements to the business
enabling environment.
Egypt has placed significant emphasis on attracting foreign investment in order to create
new employment opportunities, increase exports and encourage technology transfer. Recently,
the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) was revamped and given a direct
reporting relationship with the newly created Ministry of Investment. GAFI’s new management
has requested MIGA to design a technical assistance proposal to provide capacity building
services to the institution with a view to improving its ability to bring foreign investment into the
country. This work is currently underway. The first element of the technical assistance proposal
will be the updating of a previous assessment made by MIGA (in 2003).
MIGA provided its first political risk insurance guarantee in Egypt to a Spanish investor
in FY04. The project was in the infrastructure sector for a management contract awarded by the
Cairo Governorate for the management of solid waste in Cairo.

88

Vision for the future
There are five inter-linked themes in Egypt's vision for the private sector:
•

Improving the business environment. Promoting a supportive environment and
eliminating unnecessary constraints for private sector development, enabling it to
meet international standards of cost and quality.

•

Integration in the global and regional economies. Ensuring full participation in
global and regional markets while mitigating transitional social costs of the
integration.

•

Privatization. Reducing the role of state owned enterprises in the manufacture and
distribution of private goods and services.

•

Strengthening partnership between private and public sectors. Redefining how the
public and private sector work together and reorienting the public sector towards
more efficient provision of public goods.

•

Supporting development of Small and Medium Enterprises. Creating an environment
that nurtures Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) through better access to markets,
resources and infrastructure.

Overlaying these themes is the need to: (a) reform the financial sector, and (b) improve
infrastructure services.
Private Sector Development Priorities
Improving the business environment. The Egypt Investment Climate Assessment has
identified a wide range of constraints to business development in Egypt, including significant redtape and administrative barriers, access to credit and access to land issues.
Private firms often indicate the quality of tax and customs administration as a primary
constraint. These systems operate in a way that imposes uncertainty, delays and excess costs on
Egyptian businesses, particularly SMEs. Officials continue to exercise considerable discretion in
the application of tax and trade-related regulations, raising compliance costs and evasion. There
may be scope for streamlining tax incentives for new investments to make them more effective.
The commercial legal system is also regarded as too slow, expensive and cumbersome in
resolving commercial legal disputes and therefore is not heavily relied on by businesses. This
limits the development of impersonal and complex contracting and raises the cost of business
transactions.
Access to resources is another major constraint to growth of private firms. The financial
system is characterized by a low level of competition, relatively high intermediation costs and a
low level of innovation. This set-up has limited the access to credit for new firms and in particular
emerging SMEs. Also, while education is plentiful, skills are not. Human resources with
appropriate vocational and technical training are central to meeting the demands of the private
sector in a more competitive economy.
Insufficient provision and low quality of infrastructure services impose excess costs on
Egyptian firms, both exporters and non-exporters, limiting their competitiveness and discouraging
investment. Port services are slow and costly. Evidence also suggests that there are constraints in
domestic transport (in part due to the limited road density), telecommunications and reliable
electric power supply. Finally, access to land or industrial sites also presents a constraint to
private sector activity.
Integration into regional and global economies. To benefit from integration into
regional and global markets, Egypt needs to: (i) improve its export performance in non-oil
sectors; and (ii) promote technological innovation and take other steps towards developing a

89

knowledge-based economy. Recently, the government has taken bold steps toward further trade
liberalization. The average tariff has dropped from 14.6 percent to 9 percent, the number of tariff
brackets decreased from 27 to six, and the list of products subject to tariffs has been shortened
from 13,000 to 6,000. However, progress with removing other barriers to integration, such as
lack of marketing and distributing companies and absence of export credit and insurance services,
particularly for SMEs, has been slower. Export Processing Zones (EPZs) have not lived up to
their potential in terms of generating foreign exchange earnings, employment and attracting FDI.
Data on the performance of the EPZs is inadequate to monitor performance, objectives are
unclear and there are few if any requirements regarding exports for firms registering in the zone.
Government is developing measures to further improve export competitiveness. These
include: further simplification of custom procedures; development of airports and seaports;
assistance to SMEs in foreign marketing; facilitation of insurance against export risks, especially
for SMEs; adoption of harmonized international standards and procedures to place producers on
equal footing with international competitors; taking maximum advantage of the free trade and
partnership agreements with EU and the Arab countries, and achieving similar agreements with
the United States; and improving performance of the EPZ sector by facilitating exporter access to
duty free inputs and infrastructure, tax, labor and environmental regulations in the zone.
In an increasingly global economy, where knowledge about how to excel competitively
and information about who excels are both more readily available, the effective creation, use and
dissemination of knowledge and new technologies is increasingly the key to success.
Technological innovation is quickly becoming the key factor in global competitiveness. To
improve its knowledge economy infrastructure Egypt will need to:
•

strengthen the general legal environment in field of intellectual property rights and
develop new “cyber-laws”;

•

improve the quality of telecommunications, especially internet infrastructure;

•

strengthen the financial services sector by promoting the widespread use of credit cards
and automatic payment systems;

Privatization. The share of the public sector in GDP stands at about 30 percent in Egypt,
which is relatively high compared to other countries. A public sector dominated economy
typically reduces the productivity of the private sector by reducing its access to finance, raising
the cost of finance, and increasing the average wage in the economy. To mitigate such pressures
for the private sector, Egypt launched an ambitious privatization program in the early 1990s,
which resulted in the transfer of about one third of SOE assets to private owners. By the end of
the decade implementation of the program slowed down, but the new government is planning to
revive it and to abandon a concept of a 'strategic' commodity or sector that must remain in
government hands. While some sectors and utilities will probably remain off limits on the
grounds that they are vital for national security, the number of such cases will be greatly reduced.
Moreover, while such companies would remain part of the state, their management could be
outsourced to the private sector.
In approaching the next phase of the privatization program, it would be useful to focus on
the following issues:
•

effective "commercial" corporatization of state-owned enterprises and economic
activities that continue to be held at both the central government and municipal levels;

•

addressing investors' risk concerns through the development of financial instruments such
as guarantees when appropriate;

•

ensuring a level playing field between foreigners and local investors;

•

developing a coordinated regulatory and policy regime that is consistent with the needs of

90

a privately held infrastructure sector;
•

providing substantial financial and other supportive resources to deal with restructuring
and commercialization costs.

Strengthening cooperation and partnership between the private and public sectors. The
general agenda for private sector growth in Egypt has been clear for many years - discussion of
ways to create an improved business environment that leads to better competitiveness,
privatization, support for SMEs, and financial sector strengthening have occurred many times.
Insufficient progress in implementing this agenda could be explained, in large part, by ways in
which the public sector and private sector interact or do not interact. It is generally recognized
there is substantial room for improvement in this relationship.
Moving forward on this issue requires the following:
•

Strengthening accountability mechanisms for public and private sectors: The impact and
effectiveness of government/public sector organizations can be improved through the
introduction of such accountability and incentive mechanisms as: performance
evaluations for senior management, performance based budgets, and unified accounting
rules for the treatment of SOE profits. Corporate governance improvements in the
private sector could also be instrumental in building a broader and deeper capital market
that would help place corporate finance on a sounder basis.

•

Developing public-private partnerships. This can be facilitated through legislation to:
eliminate certain unnecessary restrictions that are presently imposed on the private
sector’s participation in infrastructure projects; set a clear and unambiguous regulatory
framework and quality standards for such participation; and establish a system to select
investors through transparent and competitive procedures.

•

A concerted effort to strengthen the private sector's voice through the creation of stronger
business agencies, and a willingness on the Government side to consult.

Supporting development of small and medium enterprises. SMEs and micro enterprises
are a significant force in the Egyptian economy. Enterprises with less than 10 workers are
estimated to contribute 80 percent of private sector value added and account for 75 percent of
private sector employment. SMEs typically face complex business regulations and have little
incentive to join the formal sector. A high level of informality means that those businesses that do
choose to operate within the formal sector suffer from unfair competition, as their competitors
have significantly lower operational costs. At the same time, the revenue base for the
Government is reduced while the informal firms suffer from rent-seeking behavior on the part of
revenue and other government officials.
Supporting development of the SMEs could involve the following:
•

PEP-MENA has been and will continue to be active in the area of access to finance for
SMEs. This effort includes work with the financial sector to improve the capacity of
local financial institutions to service this market, and generally improving access to
finance through strengthening of the financial sector.

•

Micro enterprises would benefit from the encouragement of micro-financial institutions
that are managed by the private sector or NGOs.

•

Reducing and simplifying the bureaucratic red tape that overwhelms Egyptian businesses
but particularly SMEs.

•

Strengthening marketing channels, to ensure better information and support is available.

Reforming the banking sector. Public dominance of the banking sector in Egypt, especially
the banking and insurance components, imposes a burden on both the private and public sectors.

91

The private sector faces relatively high costs (real lending rates are now close to 10 percent) and
poor access to credit while government faces contingent liabilities arising from high levels of
non-performing loans among publicly owned banks, for example. The Government of Egypt is
considering a number of measures to improve the performance and soundness of the banking
sector in the long run. Among these are: divestiture of public shares in joint venture (publicprivate) commercial banks; privatization of one of the four major public commercial banks and
restructuring of the other three; consolidation among banks to create more efficient, larger
entities; and strengthening prudential regulations and supervisory procedures.
Improving quality of the infrastructure services. More and better infrastructure is
needed in Egypt to help the private sector become more competitive. While certain infrastructure
services are provided at subsidized prices (e.g. power and water), inefficient or inadequate
provision of other services (e.g., transportation) increase costs for the private sector. In most
cases, pricing and management reforms are called for while, in some cases, additional public
investments are also needed. In addition, institutional arrangements for infrastructure financing
need to be addressed in many infrastructure sub-sectors in order to improve their overall
efficiency. For example, while the technical performance of the generation, transmission and
distribution systems is adequate, consumers receive a reliable service at a low price, and the
power sector in Egypt has, over the last few years, experienced notable achievements, these
arrangements have not been adequate to establish financial discipline and sound commercial
practices in the power sector. The financial position of the sector is weak; there are subsidies in
electricity tariffs and large arrears in the payment of electricity bills, mainly by several major
customers in the public sector.
Government plans to address the infrastructure problem by undertaking some
infrastructure investments on its own account, by focusing on critical pricing and management
reforms where possible and by facilitating the involvement of the private sector in other
infrastructure services. With respect to the latter, priority concerns include:
•

Removal of unjustified restrictions on private sector participation in infrastructure
projects and creation of a level playing field between public and private sector players;

•

Improvement of the regulatory framework for the private sector participation;

•

Review of the BOOT regulations for infrastructure; and

•

Establishing tariff structures and targeted subsidy systems compatible with opening of the
sector to competition.

World Bank Group Assistance Strategy
Overview
Egypt enjoys strong donor support from a wide variety of institutions including USAID,
the EU, UNDP, AfDB, Kuwait Fund, KfW and the Islamic Development Bank. In broad terms
the WBG strategy is to work in partnership with other donors to provide the following support:
The IBRD will (i) facilitate knowledge sharing on the implementation aspects of the
reform agenda and (ii) provide financial resources to fund some of the implementation and
restructuring costs arising from the need to restructure the financial sector. One area where the
Bank can help is in facilitating the public/private partnership dialogue. In parallel, specific
technical assistance can be provided in areas that will accelerate change, such as privatization and
private participation in infrastructure (PPI). To deliver on this agenda the Bank will work closely
with the Government and other members of the donor community to develop innovative "low
cost" financing packages.
IFC will focus on: (i) supporting PPI initiatives with either guarantee, capital or advisory
services as the case may require, (ii) assisting the development of new financial sector institutions

92

and instruments for the private sector, (iii) catalyzing new private sector investment in
manufacturing, petrochemicals, oil and gas, as well as the social sectors, and (iv) supporting SME
initiatives. MIGA will remain available to provide guarantee instruments to facilitate new private
sector investment, if required.
Assistance Proposals
This section provides a description of assistance proposals in the five major areas of the
PSD agenda in Egypt (improving business environment, integration in the global and regional
economies, privatization, strengthening cooperation and partnership between private and public
sectors, supporting development of small and medium enterprises), as well as two cross-cutting
themes (financial sector reform and infrastructure services). In addition, it highlights areas of
potential comparative advantage for the IBRD and IFC.
Improving business environment. The Egypt ICA has identified a wide range of
constraints to business development, including access to land and finance and significant red-tape
and administrative barriers. Follow-up to the ICA could include a series of policy notes to move
the ICA recommendations to the implementation stage. These would focus on: (i) how to start the
reform of the industrial land market, (ii) the steps needed to simplify business entry, and (iii) how
to reform some administrations in their dealings with businesses (e.g. inspections). As the
authorities embark on some of the reforms recommended in the ICA, further work could be done
to help establish an impact evaluation framework to measure the effectiveness of the reforms in
achieving their goals. These follow-up activities will be closely coordinated with other donors’
support, in particular the IFC’s new technical assistance facility for the region (PEP-MENA).
The five pillars of PEP-MENA are technical assistance for the financial sector, support to SMEs,
assistance for improvement of the business enabling environment, support to development of
public-private partnerships (particularly for infrastructure) and assistance in privatizing or
restructuring state-owned enterprises.
Integration in the global and regional economies. The IBRD will assist Egypt in
development of its sea- and airports, as well as in streamlining and rationalizing customs
procedures. IFC plans to facilitate and encourage cross border investments into Egypt and to
support expansion of the internationally competitive Egyptian companies into new markets.
MIGA stands ready as well to support foreign investment by Egyptian companies through the
provision of guarantees against non-commercial risks. MIGA is one of the few agencies available
to provide this support to Egyptian companies, and has already done so in the past (Orascom for a
$90 million investment in Pakistan). MIGA also plans to include specific sectors of the Egyptian
economy in a MENA Enterprise Benchmarking Program, planned for FY06, which would
provide specific data on the competitiveness of specific Egyptian industries. FIAS will continue
to support efforts to improve the climate for foreign investors.
Privatization. WBG assistance in this area could involve: (a) technical assistance to
improve performance of public enterprises through the development of monitoring and
management mechanisms, and corporatization; and (b) pilot turn-around funds to encourage
privatization of selected public enterprises. In the longer term, depending on the speed of the
privatization program, the IBRD could provide financial resources to facilitate the program.
Privatization advisory services can be provided by the IFC in cases where the Government would
prefer to give IFC a mandate for a particular transaction. MIGA can also provide assistance in
two different areas. First, MIGA’s online services can allow the privatization agency and sectoral
ministries to more widely disseminate information on pending privatizations to potential investors
and lenders, deepening the potential investor pool. Second, MIGA guarantees can help alter the
risk perception of investors and realize the projects by making them more attractive, particularly
as MIGA can cover sovereign and sub-sovereign risk.
Strengthening cooperation and partnership between private and public sectors. The

93

WBG will use its experience to facilitate the broad public-private sector dialogue in Egypt. In
recent years the Bank Group has supported a variety of approaches (consultative forums,
regulatory complaint offices, and strengthening professional associations) designed to foster
ongoing public-private dialogue on the objectives, scope and details of reforms. Such activities
have included the creation of Private Sector Foundations in Senegal, Ghana and elsewhere,
Competitiveness Review Commissions (Cote d'Ivoire and Cameroon) and simpler networking
activities which have helped to harmonize the activities of diverse PSD groups and focus the
agenda for public-private debate. To enhance the government - private sector dialogue the WBG
can support a series of workshops and strengthening institutional and organizational capacity
along these lines. A specific component of this work could be to develop conflict resolution
mechanisms as well as to upgrade the capacity and support systems of local professional
associations and chambers of commerce.
Supporting development of small and medium Enterprises. The Bank Group can
provide assistance in three dimensions of SME development: (a) facilitating access to resources,
especially finance; (b) providing business development assistance; and (c) helping to build
linkages between Egyptian and foreign SMEs. The nature of this assistance, in turn, varies for
different categories of SMEs. Egyptian SMEs represent very heterogeneous sectors that consist of
a large variety of enterprises in terms of the number of employees, amount of assets, technical
competencies, know-how and dynamism, and range from informal to formal, self-employment to
enterprises hiring 200 or more workers, artisanal products to high technology products, or
subsistence enterprises to those that are more competitive and dynamic.
Specific initiatives could include:
•

Focused lending opportunities to facilitate access to finance (e.g., IFC investments in
non-bank financing instruments, such as leasing and factoring as well as IBRD assistance
to develop modem export finance mechanisms, including guarantees etc.).The focus
would be on sustainability. In addition, financial intermediaries will be targeted for
assistance. Opportunities to issue credit lines for direct SME lending, especially in the
leasing industry will be examined.

•

As part of the WBG assistance, the business partnership group could help to spur the
development of new partnership activities between selected European and Egyptian
Chambers of Commerce that would: transfer expertise on best practices of Chamber
services for SMEs, encourage linkages amongst European and Egyptian SMEs, and
provide SME skills development in joint ventures and e-commerce.

•

A particular focus of MIGA’s efforts in Egypt will be to support investments in the
agribusiness, manufacturing and services sectors, which tend to be dominated by SMEs.
MIGA will also market its Small Investors’ Program, which provides streamlined
coverage to SMEs, throughout the MENA region.

Financial sector reform. The IBRD is planning two operations in Egypt over the CAS
period. The Financial Sector Restructuring Loan will assist the government in preparing
privatization of one major public bank and restructuring of others, divestiture of public shares in
joint venture (public-private) commercial banks, and consolidation of banking sector to create
more efficient, larger private financial institutions. The Mortgage Finance Project, which will
focus on establishment of a market-based liquidity facility for the mortgage market, strengthening
the regulatory framework for mortgage lending, and modernization of the property rights
registration system. In addition, the IBRD may provide assistance in development of the private
pension funds.
IFC would follow a three-pronged approach in the financial sector: creating or
strengthening existing institutions, providing medium to long-term funding, and deepening the
financial sector by developing the bond markets and introducing new financial instruments. IFC's

94

institution building role will build on the successful experience of setting up joint ventures
between local financial institutions and international companies that are industry leaders, to
promote the transfer of expertise and best practice. IFC expects to be active in setting up
institutions to engage in activities that are as yet underdeveloped, including mortgage finance
(such as the recent investment in the Egyptian Housing Finance Company), underwriting and
trading of bonds, and factoring. Developing mortgage finance will first entail the growth of a
primary market, where existing or new institutions provide mortgages. A second stage will be the
development of a secondary mortgage market, which will need the introduction of securitization
and setting up secondary mortgage institutions.
Extending financing to intermediaries engaged in the SME sector, such as leasing
companies, will be the focus of particular attention. Developing the corporate bond market, and
fixed income markets more generally, is an important component of general financial sector
development. An active, well functioning primary market provides an important corporate
finance tool that can reduce interest rate, foreign currency and refunding risk. Egypt has a
somewhat active primary corporate bond market (although activity has dropped off sharply
recently) with established procedures, but an illiquid secondary market. IFC could assist GOE in
setting up a new institution(s) or strengthening existing ones that underwrite and trade debt
instruments. This activity would also support development of an active government securities
market, which provides benchmark interest rates across the maturity spectrum, among other
financial sector benefits.
Improving infrastructure services. Areas for IBRD and IFC activity include ports and
airports, power, water and wastewater. The Bank Group could support investments in these areas
through technical and financial assistance. The FY06-09 lending program contains projects to
help increase electricity generation (the El Tebbin Power Project) and improve transportation of
tradable goods (the Ports Sector Development Project). Analytic work is also envisaged in the
area of transport sector development, especially with respect to the railways system.
The water and sanitation sector has benefited from substantial donor funding over the
past two decades. With donor funding expected to decline, policy advice will focus on attracting
private sector participation in the provision of water and sanitation services. Low water tariffs are
a major impediment to private sector participation. Reforms of the regulatory framework are
expected to decentralize decision-making and grant more autonomy to municipal water and
sanitation authorities in setting tariffs. The WBG can advise municipal authorities on PSP options
and IFC could provide direct financing to the projects.
It is expected that there will continue to be demand for IFC financing in power
generation. IFC's strategy will be to explore the scope for private participation in the distribution
sub-sector and in developing alternative sources for generation such as wind power. In this sector,
Egyptian authorities are dealing simultaneously with the cornerstone elements of sector reform,
namely sector structure, ownership policy and regulation, and pricing issues. Until recently,
electricity supply was under monopoly control of the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA), but
this has changed and the private sector is now authorized to build, own, operate and transfer
BOOT power generation plants. IFC has two investments in the power sector and could consider
others. In the renewable energy area work to develop self sustaining markets can also be pursued.
Through PSAS, IFC can provide advisory services to facilitate private transactions. In the power
sector, reforms need to be aimed at attracting private sector participation and financing of the
large amount of investment needed in generation, transmission and distribution to cater for load
growth.
MIGA has recently issued a guarantee in the provision of solid waste services in Cairo,
and expects that foreign investors interested in infrastructure opportunities, e.g. in privatizations
and PPPs, will find considerable interest in MIGA guarantees – particularly against the breach of
government (including sub-sovereign) obligations. The extent of MIGA support will, however,

95

depend on meaningful reform of the state sector and the opening of markets for foreign
investment.

Annex 4: World Bank Institute Strategy
To provide sustained support to the CAS implementation in the area of capacity building,
WBI has articulated a strategy involving close alignment with the CAS in selective areas and the
rolling of in-country multi-year targeted programs, complementary to country-focused
operational interventions. The strategy builds on results of a baseline evaluation of WBI activities
in FY03 and on a strong partnership between WBI and country operations thanks to the
decentralization of a WBI senior staff in the Cairo Office.
During the first years of the CAS, WBI activities, building on ongoing efforts launched in
FY05, will focus primarily on two CAS pillars in response to GoE request to support reform
implementation in these areas: (i) facilitating private sector development; and (ii) enhancing the
provision of selected public goods. With respect to the third pillar, WBI could become more
engaged during the CAS period once focus shifts from formulation to implementation. Activities
will be specifically targeted at Egyptian high-level officials to improve dialogue/discuss options
on key policy reforms and support implementation. The targeting of senior officials with decision
making capabilities has proven effective over the past two years in moving reform agendas. A
second set of activities targeted to the “middle tier” and stakeholders will be developed to support
reform implementation and broaden support. The in-country activities will be complemented by
regional and global WBI activities.
The indicative WBI program is shown in the results matrix (See Annex 1). The timing of
specific activities will be closely linked to progress on the operations side and may be revisited as
necessary to ensure a synchronized approach. By end FY06, a new baseline evaluation covering
FY03-06 will be conducted to assess impact of current WBI approach in Egypt. Activities for
FY07 and 08 will be reviewed at mid-year drawing on evaluation of the program and revised as
necessary to best support the evolution of the CAS.
In support of the objective of facilitating private sector development, WBI will focus on
three areas. A Financial Sector and Capacity Enhancement Program will be conducted as a direct
support to GoE ongoing financial reform and complementary to the preparation of the Financial
Sector Restructuring Loan and the Mortgage Development Project. An Investment Climate
Assessment Rapid Results Approach Initiative will be launched to jumpstart the implementation
of reforms identified in the Investment Climate Assessment and a Trade Facilitation Program will
also be initiated.
To support the second CAS pillar, WBI will focus on Public-Private Partnerships and
Infrastructure Finance, Local Governance Management, and a multi-year Education Enhancement
Program to improve the quality of education and decentralization. For greater impact, a training
of trainers component supporting the capacity of local training institutes will be incorporated.
Other priority programs include a Social Protection Program covering issues related to social
safety nets, labor market, pension reform and a Water Resource Management Initiative.
WBI will also continue its support through a poverty impact assessment program
currently being undertaken with other donors with a view to train the Social Fund to undertake
impact assessment.

Annex 5: Macroeconomic Simulations
The short-term impact of shocks is simulated below using the quantitative framework
proposed by Devarajan and Go21 (2002).
Following this framework, we firstly estimate the short-run growth effects of
macroeconomic shocks and policies using a trivariate VAR model (with Egypt GDP growth,
OECD GDP growth, and Egypt government consumption as a share of GDP as its variables) and
assuming that relative prices and the composition of output are unchanged.
Secondly, we use the “1-2-3 Model,” a static, multi-sector, general-equilibrium model of
a small open economy, to capture the effects of macroeconomic policies and shocks on relative
prices and the composition of output, assuming that the aggregate output is fixed at the levels
implied by the VAR simulations. The 1-2-3 Model divides the economy into two sectors: exports
(E) and domestic goods (D). There is one other good in the economy, imports (M). The model
assumes that a constant elasticity of transformation function links outputs of E and D, and
consumers have a constant elasticity of substitution utility function in D and M.
We simulate two deviations from the baseline macroeconomic scenario for the period
2004-2007 – “External Shock” and “Policy Shock”.
For the “External shock” scenario we assume that the growth rate of the OECD will fall
by 2 percentage points in 2005 compared to its implied baseline level, and will remain 1
percentage point below such level in 2006. We assume that this event will represent an aggregate
demand shock rather than terms of trade shock for Egypt. We use the investment closure of the
model, assuming that the primary response of the economic agents to the shock will be
adjustment in the investment rates. We also assume that the government will manage to meet the
inflation targets.
For the “Policy shock” scenario we assume that the government consumption’s share in
GDP will increase by 10 percent in 2005. VAR simulations show that even short-term effect of
increases in government consumption is likely to be adverse: in the simulations, they cause fall in
growth rate over a three-year period. Most likely reason for this in Egyptian context is crowdingout effects of higher fiscal deficits, which may offset the Keynesian stimulus to the economy
from the increase in government spending (at least if a large portion of the latter was financed
domestically). We use the investment closure of the model and assume that this policy will not
allow the government to meet its inflation targets.
The results of the simulations are presented in the Tables 1 and 2.

Annex C: Egypt Country Financing Parameters

Item

Parameter

Cost Sharing. Limit on the proportion of
individual project costs that the Bank may
finance.

Up to 100%

Recurrent Cost Financing. Any limits that
would apply to the overall amount of
recurrent expenditures that the Bank may
finance.

No country level
limit.

Local Cost Financing. Are the requirements
for Bank financing of local expenditures met,
namely: (i) financing requirements for the
country’s development program would
exceed the public sector’s own resources
(e.g., from taxation and other revenues) and
expected domestic borrowing; and (ii) the
financing of foreign expenditures alone would
not enable the Bank to assist in the financing
of individual projects.
Taxes and Duties. Are there any taxes and
duties that the Bank would not finance?

Yes

None

Explanation/Remarks
Cost sharing arrangements for individual projects would be determined
based on project context. The Bank’s financing share is expected to be
higher in social sector and lower in infrastructure investments. The Bank
will continue to seek government counterpart funding in most projects and
expects to co-finance many projects with other development partners.
Recurrent cost financing would be applied on a case-by-case basis
grounded on due diligence project reviews and approvals. The Bank will
take into account sustainability issues at project and sector levels. Recurrent
cost financing is broadly expected to stay at current modest levels.
The requirements for local cost financing are met. The Bank may finance
local costs as needed to achieve individual project objectives.

No taxes or duties have been identified as excessive, unreasonable or
discriminatory. At the project level, the Bank would consider whether
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share of project costs.
