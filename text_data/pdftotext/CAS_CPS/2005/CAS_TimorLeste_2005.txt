EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Timor-Leste, the world’s newest nation, was created out of ashes. In 1999 the population
voted overwhelmingly for the restoration o f independence from Indonesia, but the outcome o f
the referendum was met with an orchestrated campaign o f violence and destruction in which
more than a thousand people lost their lives and the country’s infrastructure was left in ruins. An
estimated 70 percent o f private homes and public buildings were burned to the ground. Bridges
and power lines were demolished, and the telecommunications system was rendered inoperable.
Valuable files, including land and property titles, c i v i l registry, and education records were
destroyed. Following the ballot, most Indonesian citizens left the territory, resulting in a severe
shortage o f qualified and experienced professionals, The country was left with only two power
engineers, 20 percent o f i t s secondary school teachers, 23 medical doctors o f which one surgeon,
and not a single qualified pharmacist.
2.

Given that the country started from scratch both physically and institutionally, TimorLeste has done remarkably well. Major steps have been taken to build the nation, and the
country has maintained peace and political stability. Free and fair elections were held and a
Constitution adopted, with almost all the institutions i t mandated now created. A National
Development Plan (NDP), a Stability Program (SP), and Sector Investment Programs (SIPS)
guide the use o f Government and donor resources, and have recently been presented to the W o r l d
Bank and International Monetary Fund Boards as a Poverty Reduction Strategy. Since the
restoration o f independence, the Government has focused squarely on the implementation o f the
NDP and SP. The Government has adopted a legal framework for petroleum production,
taxation, and revenue management that i s considered international best-practice and i s consistent
with the principles endorsed b y the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. I t has brought
about macro-economic stability and made solid progress in restoring public services. Health
indicators have improved gradually, and today more children-including poor children and
girls-are in school than under the Indonesian occupation. Around-the-clock access to electricity
has been re-established in the capital, together with a cost-recovery system. All district capitals
have access to telephone services. The financial sector i s growing rapidly. Overall, the new
nation’s performance has been considerably better than that o f other post-conflict countries.
Yet Timor-Leste is at a cross-road, and progress remains fragile. Establishing a well3.
functioning state w i l l take years, if not decades. The country has made great strides in a short
time, but much remains to be done. Timor-Leste i s among the world’s poorest countries, and lags
behind the region in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. While petroleum production
and associated Government revenue have risen rapidly, non-petroleum production, fuelled b y a
large international presence, has decreased as this presence winds down. With a population
growth rate that i s among the highest in the world, per-capita income has declined and poverty
has most likely increased. Unemployment in urban areas i s high, especially for youth. The
private sector faces formidable constraints, and farmers are only slowly adjusting to the
elimination o f the heavily subsidized Indonesian marketing system. Capacity-building initiatives
have not yet met with desired success, leaving institutional capacity very thin and w i t h
considerable variation across agencies, as witnessed b y the Government’s slow, incomplete and
uneven budget execution. Governance and corruption problems are beginning to emerge.
Communication between the Government and the population i s inadequate and often ineffective,
resulting in limited mutual understanding. Timor-Leste i s at a juncture where i t can consolidate

Executive Summary

11

gains and create conditions for sustained growth and poverty reduction, or descend down a path
o f poor governance, continuously increasing poverty and inequality and, possibly, renewed
conflict. As a petroleum-rich country, Timor-Leste needs to be particularly vigilant in
maintaining good governance and promoting employment outside the petroleum sector, to avoid
the resource curse and Dutch disease prevalent in many resource-rich countries.
4.

Over the past f i v e years, strong partnership with donors around a whole-of-Govemment,
results-oriented framework firmly anchored in the NDP and the SP has been key to TimorLeste ’s successful nation-building process. Despite being a small financial contributor, the Bank

has played a central role b y assisting the Government in forging these partnerships. Accordingly,
the Bank’s business model has evolved around coordination, sustained b y analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) and multi-donor grant funds, rather than lending. The backbone o f this
approach has been the Transition Support Program (TSP), now known as the Consolidation
Support Program (CSP), a budget support operation financed b y ten partners and supported b y
several others as observers. The TSP/CSP has focused on an annual, cross-Government results
matrix and has been the principal instrument for policy dialogue between the Government and i t s
development partners. The Government has praised this instrument for respecting ownership,
building capacity in prioritizing interventions, sharing lessons from across the world, exploiting
the synergies among development partners, and providing a framework for international
accountability.

5.

The Bank aims to support Timor-Leste in consolidating its early progress, and moving
from a focus on post-conflict issues to creating the conditions for growth outside the petroleum
sector and for poverty reduction. T o achieve this, the three-year Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) w i l l support the NDP and SP objectives o f delivering sustainable services, creating

productive employment, and strengthening governance, while mainstreaming gender and youth
across these three strategic pillars. Taking into account the lessons learned, the CAS adopts four
principles of engagement: building institutional capacity, deepening the results orientation,
strengthening transparency and communication, and consolidating and extending the strong
international partnerships. The CAS presents a results framework around the three strategic
pillars, which will be sustained through partnership with a host of donors, not just Bank
interventions. The results framework w i l l be translated annually into a results matrix for
continued multi-donor budget support through the CSP, and the CSP will remain the principal
forum for dialogue between the Government and i t s development partners while emerging Sector
Working Groups gain strength. The Bank recognizes that the CAS objectives are ambitious, but
considers them achievable given the commitment of the Government and the strength o f
partnerships.

6.
To achieve the proposed results, the Bank Group w i l l deploy a mix of multi-sector and
sector grants and AAA. The annual, single-tranche, multi-donor CSP w i l l underpin the three-

pillar approach to the CAS. The Bank w i l l contribute a small amount o f funding to the CSP to
support the gradual shift o f non-budget donor expenditures onto the Government budget. I f and
when Government budget execution improves considerably, the Bank would consider channeling
a higher proportion o f i t s assistance through the CSP and recommend the same to other
development partners. In complement to the CSP, and with a view to improving the effective and
efficient implementation o f the Government’s budget, the CAS w i l l support the Planning and
Financial Management Capacity Building Program, a multi-donor initiative targeted at the

Executive Summary

...

111

Ministry o f Planning and Finance, line agencies, and districts. Improved execution o f the
growing budget with a focus on labor-intensive programs is, in the short run, the most effective
way to increase non-petroleum GDP and to create jobs. On the basis o f the SIPS, the Bank w i l l
also continue sector support to health, education, agriculture, and private sector development,
and considerably extend i t s involvement in energy. This w i l l be pursued in concert with other
donors, through new operations and the ongoing portfolio. Economic and sector work and
technical assistance are key elements o f the CAS.

7.

The implementation of Timor-Leste’s NDP and the CAS is subject to a number of risks.

8.

Given the above, Board members may wish to discuss the following:

Given the whole-of-Government character o f the CAS, risks faced b y the Government and the
Bank are largely the same. They include fragile Government implementation capacity, increased
dissatisfaction with Government performance and associated emergence o f c i v i l unrest and
violence, worsening governance and entrenchment o f corruption, and fragmentation o f donor
assistance. Both the CAS pillars and principles o f engagement are crafted to mitigate these risks.

I s i t appropriate to adopt a broad-based approach that aims to create the conditions for
sustainable growth and poverty reduction underpinned b y a results matrix that relies
not only on the Bank’s interventions but on broad partnerships with a host o f donors?

Are the pillars and principles of engagement appropriate for creating the conditions
for growth outside the petroleum sector and for poverty reduction?
I s the m i x o f instruments and activities adequate? I s i t appropriate to maintain a small
budget support program to assist the shifting on budget o f donor expenditures that are
currently financed outside the budget and to recommend broader use o f this
instrument as budget execution improves?

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presents the World Bank’s strategy for TimorLeste for FY06-FY08. I t i s the first full CAS for Timor-Leste, following the 2000 Transition

Support Strategy (TSS). The Bank began to prepare the CAS in 2003 but, at the request o f the
Government, postponed i t s finalization pending the completion of the Government’s Sector
Investment Programs (SIPS). In line with the strong partnerships that have been forged among
the Government and donors, this CAS has been agreed b y all development partners and the
Government. I t represents not just the Bank’s efforts, but the wider efforts o f Government and all
donors, what i s known as the “whole-of-Government approach.” This refers to the highly
collaborative way in which nation building has been pursued in the world’s newest country.

2.
The CAS incorporates a three-year results matrix. A CAS Progress Report w i l l be
prepared in FY07. The three-year timeframe of the CAS covers the remainder of the current
Government’s mandate, which runs through 2007, as well as the first year o f the incoming
Government’s tenure, pending the articulation o f i t s vision and strategy. The CAS i s structured
as follows: (a) background on the country context, to give an understanding o f the unique
situation in Timor-Leste, progress to date, and remaining challenges; (b) Timor-Leste’ s
development vision and strategy, as set out in i t s National Development Plan (NDP), Stability
Program (SP), and SIPs, which together were recently presented to the Board as a Poverty
Reduction Strategy; (c) lessons learned under the TSS and in general since the Bank has been
involved in Timor-Leste; (d) the Bank’s strategy and program o f activities, including three
strategic pillars and four principles o f engagement; and (e) risks and mitigation measures.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Transition
3.

Occupying the mountainous eastern half of the island of Timor, Timor-Leste was a
Portuguese colony for 400 years. Following a brief civil war, the country unilaterally declared
its independence on November 28, 1975. Within days it was invaded and illegally occupied by
neighboring Indonesia. For 24 years the population o f Timor-Leste maintained a staunch
resistance against the invasion, characterized b y near universal popular support and effective
coordination between the armed wing o f the resistance, Falintil,’ an elaborate and active network
o f civilian supporters, “clandestinos”, and representatives in the diaspora. One-third o f the
population i s estimated to have died as a result o f the occupation. Following the fall o f President
Suharto in 1998, Indonesia offered to hold a referendum allowing the territory a choice between
autonomous status or an independent state. An overwhelming majority o f Timorese voted for
independence. Tragically, the referendum was accompanied b y a well-planned campaign o f
violence led b y armed militia. The violence l e f t over 1,000 people dead, the majority o f the
population displaced, and most o f the private and public physical infrastructure in ruins.

4.
Following the intervention o f a multi-lateral peacekeeping force, the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established with supreme executive,
judicial, and legislative authority. At i t s height, UNTAET included almost 9,000 uniformed and
civilian personnel. T o ensure Timorese participation early on, the National Council, a quasiparliamentary body representing different segments o f Timorese society, was created in 2000, as
well as the first transitional Government consisting o f four Timorese and four international
cabinet members. In 200 1, elections were held for a Constituent Assembly. The elections were
won b y Fretilin,2 which gained 55 o f the 88 seats in the Assembly, short o f an absolute majority,
and all in all 11 parties won representation. A second transitional Government was formed, now
composed entirely o f Timorese. Following the adoption o f the Constitution, presidential
elections were held in April 2002 and won by independence leader and Falintil Commander Jose
Alexandre (Xanana) Gusmao. The Democratic Republic o f Timor-Leste fully restored i t s
independence on M a y 20, 2002. The Constituent Assembly became the National Parliament, and
the current Government, formed b y Fretilin, was sworn in under the leadership o f Prime Minister
M a r i Bim Amude Alkatiri. A 900-person United Nations Mission o f Support in East Timor
(UNMISET) was created, focused primarily on peace-keeping, training and support to the
Timor-Leste police force, and the deployment o f advisers to Government and other State
institutions. O n M a y 20, 2005 U N M I S E T was succeeded b y the United Nations Office in TimorLeste (UNOTIL), now reduced to about 120 civilian and police advisers.

5.
Since the restoration o f independence, Timor-Leste has maintained peace and political
stability, and established security. Most countries emerging from conflict, especially new
countries, relapse into violence within five years. Timor-Leste has avoided that fate, maintained
peace and political stability, and established security. Despite differences in opinion and style,
the President, Government, and security forces have consistently worked together toward these

goals. The country’s stability has been seriously disrupted only once, b y riots in Dili in
December 2002 following the shooting and killing o f two demonstrating students b y police.
Stability was tested again during a three-week demonstration organized b y church leaders in
April/May 2005, yet the demonstration remained largely peaceful and showed the police forces
capable o f restraint and professionalism. Elections for village councils started in January 2005,
and early reports suggest high levels of participation. The upcoming presidential and
parliamentary elections to be held in 2006 or 2007 w i l l be Timor-Leste’s first in the absence o f
UN support, and w i l l constitute a test o f the leadership’s ability to manage a political transition.
6.
Recognizing the fragility o f political unity and the necessity of healing past divisions, the
leadership and communities have taken important steps to foster dialogue and reconciliation. The
Commission on Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation has used customary mechanisms to bring
about community re-integration o f perpetrators o f low-level violence during the 1999 events.
The National Dialogue, initiated b y the President, has involved a series o f local and nationallevel public meetings on the role o f the UN in an independent Timor-Leste, local government,
justice, and veterans. The leadership has also taken important steps to recognize and honor
veterans o f the resistance as called for in the Constitution. Acknowledging the potentially
destabilizing effect of disillusionment among veterans and the broad community demand for
their recognition, the President appointed three commissions to register veterans o f the armed
and civilian resistance. O n the basis o f the work o f the commissions, Parliament i s in the process
o f drafting a veterans law that w i l l establish recognition measures.
7.
C i v i l society and media play a constructive and increasingly important role. M u c h like
political leaders and Government, c i v i l society has had to make the difficult transition from
resistance against the Indonesian occupation to effective participation in nation building. A
number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) undertake useful monitoring, advocacy,
education, and advisory services in the areas o f human rights (Associacao HAK), justice
(Judicial System Monitoring Program), gender awareness (Fokupers, Rede Feto), the
environment (Haburas), and international assistance (Lao Hamutuk). As 98 percent o f TimorLeste’s population i s Catholic, the Church i s very influential and plays an active role in conflict
mitigation and service provision. The print media in Timor-Leste have grown f r o m non-existent
under Indonesian times to several daily and weekly newspapers, but only a small proportion o f
the population has access to them. National and community radio, on the other hand, reaches a
wide audience and provides a popular forum for interactive debate.

8.
Despite considerable progress, the current stability in Timor-Leste i s fragile, and the
country remains vulnerable to conflict. While limited in number, the hard-core militia remaining
in West Timor pose a real, i f small, risk o f externally generated conflict. Since 2002, there have
been several incursions b y militia in which Timorese villagers have been killed. M o r e significant
than external factors are internal fault lines contributing to the risk o f renewed violence,
including declining income, increasing poverty, high unemployment, and emerging corruption.
Rapidly expanding youth cohorts and high youth unemployment have fuelled an expansion in
martial arts groups. There are a number o f relatively small, but vocal groups who reject the
legitimacy of the Government and some former members o f the resistance continue to feel
disenfranchised. While steady improvements have been made, the security forces s t i l l lack
professionalism and experience. There have also been several serious altercations between the

Country Context

5

forces themselves, causing significant public concern. While no one o f these factors i s likely to
ignite serious conflict, their combined effect remains unpredictable.

9.
Poor outreach on the part of Government may contribute to Timor-Leste 's vulnerability.
Effective communication and genuine participation are critical to shoring up popular support for
the national development process, and for avoiding conflict. Many o f the positive and necessary
development outputs o f the last three years, such as policies, laws, and the completion o f
institutions, are largely invisible to the electorate. At the same time, service delivery results are
mixed. Expectations o f prosperity following the restoration o f independence are high, but the
Government neither has the resources nor the intention to re-establish the paternalistic State
maintained b y the Indonesian occupation. Yet the Government i s hesitant to collaborate with
c i v i l society and maintains a statist style. I t has not yet succeeded in engaging constructive critics
or in maintaining an effective dialogue with communities. While both Portuguese and Tetun are
national languages, critical documents are often only published in Portuguese, which only a
small fraction o f the population understands. Government i s increasingly recognizing the
importance o f consultation and information dissemination and has, for example, established a
public information office and recently undertaken extensive public consultations on the
petroleum revenue savings policy and the associated Petroleum Fund.

B. Governance
10.
There has been significant progress in the creation of the architecture of governance and
the associated legal and institutional frameworks. Timor-Leste's Constitution provides for

separation o f powers, essential checks and balances, and safeguards o f citizens rights. At the
restoration o f independence, the organs o f the State, including the Executive, Parliament,
Judiciary, and, particularly, the Office o f the President, existed notionally, but in some instances
without the appropriate legal framework, staff, or even offices and equipment. Since the
restoration o f independence, the Government has completed policy and legislation for these
entities and endowed them with human resources as well as physical infrastructure. Guided b y a
weekly Council o f Ministers meeting, the public administration has gradually gained capacity,
albeit with uneven results across sectors. Administrations with representatives from some
ministries have been established in each o f the 13 districts, and the 65 sub-districts have been
assigned a sub-district administrator and an economic and social development officer.

11.
Steps are being taken to provide for the effective checks and balances foreseen in the
Constitution. The Executive i s the strongest arm o f the State and needs to exercise care in
exerting i t s power with respect to the independence o f other state institutions and the media.
Parliament i s gradually enhancing i t s ability to oversee the work o f Government. The justice

sector has been hampered by inexperienced staff and weak systems, leading to an unwieldy
backlog o f cases. The Provedor dos Direitos Humanos e da JustiCa, which combines the
functions of human rights commissioner, ombudsman, and anti-comption agency, i s about to
become operational. Currently the audit o f Government accounts i s contracted out b y the
Ministry o f Planning and Finance (MPF), although the Constitution allots the task o f the
independent audit to the Court o f Appeals, pending the creation - in the long term - o f a High
Tax, Administrative, and Audit Court. While there has been significant progress in creating a
body o f law, many laws were more or less copied from other jurisdictions, and were not

Country Context

6

subjected to consultation. Hence, legislation often fails to reflect the cultural and administrative
realities o f the country and may prove difficult to implement.
The functioning of both the private and the public sectors is impeded by the extremely
low levels of education and professional experience. Only 50 percent o f adults are literate, while
less than one-third o f adults have some secondary education. The lack o f capacity i s reflective o f
both the relatively l o w levels o f s k i l l s and experience achieved in Timor-Leste under the

12.

Indonesian administration and the weaknesses o f international capacity-building efforts. Under
the Indonesian administration, most mid- and high-level positions were occupied b y Indonesians.
Their departure in 1999 left a dearth of teachers, managers, administrators, engineers,
accountants, doctors, nurses, plumbers, electricians, and other professionals. Under the UNTAET
administration, internationals occupied most key positions and were only slowly replaced b y
Timorese, often with little s k i l l s transfer, training, or even overlap.

13.
Corruption is an area of growing concern. Although no systematic surveys have been
carried out to ascertain how widespread the problem is, corruption i s perceived b y the Timorese
public to be a serious and growing problem. Cases o f corruption have emerged, particularly in
procurement, customs, the justice system, and the private sector. The Office o f the Inspector
General has actively pursued a program o f investigations since i t s establishment in 2000,
including 13 investigations in 2004. Government has referred ten cases to prosecution, but to
date none have proceeded. Additionally, discipline within the c i v i l service regarding attendance
and use of public resources i s lax. Understanding of key governance principles i s scant, and there
i s an absence o f a spirit of public service. A c i v i l service statute and associated code o f ethics
have been promulgated, but effective implementation w i l l demand further regulation and a

While the incidence of corruption may be increasing, there is also signifcant and
growing demand for good governance. There i s widespread awareness o f the effects o f poor

governance, particularly corruption, based on experience under the Indonesian administration.
Media, c i v i l society, and Parliament have all become outspoken on governance issues and have
displayed keen interest in safeguarding petroleum revenues. Associacao HAK has publicized
cases o f corruption in the justice sector. During the budget review in 2004, members o f
Parliament voiced their dissatisfaction with a review process that was deemed too short and that
does not allow dialogue with line Ministers. Professional groupings have also begun to act to
protect professional and public interests. In 2004, lawyers lodged a complaint regarding the lack
of consultation on the draft criminal code. In early 2005, over 50 journalists signed a statement
condemning Government’s boycott o f the leading daily newspaper.

C. Government Performance and Macro-Economic Management
15.
Despite the overwhelming challenges, Timor-Leste has performed well when compared
with other post-conflict countries. In a group o f nine post-conflict countries, Timor-Leste scores
highest overall on the Post-Conflict Performance Indicators, and well above average in most
areas (Figure 1).

The Govemment has shown strong leadership in prudent mucro-economic management.
Guided by the NDP and the SP, the Government has displayed strong commitment to promoting
sustainable growth and reducing poverty, as evidenced b y the elaboration and execution o f the
annual budget with a focus on basic economic and social services. Over 35 percent o f
Government recurrent spending i s on health and education, whereas less than 25 percent goes to
the security forces. Less than 40 percent o f the health recurrent budget i s spent on hospitals,
while within the education recurrent budget, 45 percent goes to primary schooling. Government
has maintained strict fiscal discipline by, for example, implementing cost recovery measures in
the electricity sector (Box 1). Inflation has remained moderate, falling to 1.8 percent in
December 2004.
Box 1: Cost Recovery in the Power Sector
Government demonstrated resolve and dexterity in taking the politically difficult step o f dramatically reducing
subsidies to the power sector since 2002. Under the Indonesian administration electricity was highly subsidized, priced at
U S D 0.02 to U S D O.OS/Kwh, and under U N T A E T i t was free. T o address this, the Government implemented a program to
install pre-paid power meters for electricity consumers in Dili. Between July 2003 and January 2005, 19,500 pre-paid
meters were installed. This has contributed to a reduction in power subsidies from 13 percent o f budget expenditures in
F Y 0 2 to 7.5 percent in W 0 5 . After a slow start to the installation program, Government strengthened i t s public outreach
efforts. These included sponsoring community meetings led b y customary authorities (chefes de suco and chefes de aldeia)
to familiarize the public with the need for the meters and the process o f their installation. Additionally, the Prime Minister,
the Minister o f Transport, Communication, and Public Works, and the Secretary o f State for Water and Electricity waged a
systematic media campaign with a consistent message o f enforcement: “Twenty-four hour power generation can only
return when every consumer pays their bill, with the help o f the pre-paid meter.” The reduction in power subsidies and the
associated restoration o f 24-hour power supply in Dili represent a major accomplishment for Government. Implementing
cost recovery after nearly four years o f free electricity i s a challenge under any circumstances. In the context o f high
electricity prices (USD 0.18 to 0.20/Kwh) and difficult economic circumstances, including a high urban unemployment
rate, it could have been destabilizing. Government’s strategic use o f consultation and communication were crucial in
smoothing the process.

Timor-Leste has appropriately focused on the legal framework for petroleum production
and revenues. Shortly after the restoration o f independence, the Government secured the
launching o f production in the Bayu Undan petroleum field b y signing the Timor Sea Treaty
with Australia, which governs the sharing o f revenue from the field between the two countries. I t
has adopted a state-of-the-art legal framework for on- and off-shore petroleum production and

taxation and a draft savings policy and associated Petroleum Fund A c t consistent with the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), for which Timor-Leste i s a pilot country,
having embraced transparency principles even before EITI existed. Consultations over these
policies and laws have been broad-based, both externally and internally, creating a national
consensus over principles that w i l l determine Timor-Leste’s future. True to stated principles, the
Government has adhered to a provisional savings policy for petroleum revenues ahead o f the
adoption of the permanent savings policy. I t has thus demonstrated i t s capacity to implement a
savings rule. Timor-Leste’s new savings policy aims to preserve the real wealth o f petroleum
resources for current and future generations o f Timorese (Box 2).
Box 2: Ensuring Prudent Governance of Petroleum Revenues
Over the next few decades, Timor-Leste stands to gain significant o i l and gas revenues, including over U S D
1 billion from FY05-09. Though this expected windfall w i l l provide much needed resources for the
implementation o f the NDP, i t poses an important set o f governance challenges. International experience suggests
that countries rich in natural resources are particularly susceptible to wasteful spending and corruption, as
evidenced b y consistently lower performance in growth and poverty reduction than in resource-poor nations.
In response to this challenge, Timor-Leste i s poised to adopt arrangements for prudent management o f
petroleum revenues for the benefit o f current and future generations. Building upon the successful Norwegian
model, the Government has developed a savings policy and draft Petroleum Fund Act laying out a framework for
sustainable management o f petroleum revenues over the long term. The policy and draft Act have been subject to
broad public consultations, both locally and abroad, and are expected to become effective early in FY06. These
arrangements are consistent with principles o f international good practice:
A savings policy has been adopted to preserve the real value o f petroleum wealth b y spreading
a)
expenditures over an infinite time horizon, safeguarding a sustainable budget in perpetuity. The conditions under
which the Government can withdraw funds above the

as part o f the approval o f the regular Government

demonstrated expertise in investment management, and one other person appointed by the Minister, will be
established to advise the Government on Fund investments.
Governance mechanisms have been put in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the use o f
e)
funds. The draft Act requires the timely publication o f quarterly reports and annual financial statements and the
public release o f non-confidential information. An independent Consultative Council w i l l be established to advise
Parliament on issues related to the Fund. This council i s expected to comprise former senior Government
officials and members appointed b y Parliament, Government, civil society, the private sector, and religious
organizations. Independent external audits w i l l be carried out b y an internationally recognized accounting firm,
and audit reports w i l l be adapted into a format accessible to the public. The Government has established
transparency as a fundamental principle in the draft Act, requiring the publication o f aggregate information on
company payments. The arrangements set out in the savings policy and draft Petroleum Fund Act are key to
safeguarding Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth. Yet their success will depend critically on the effective
implementation o f all checks and balances set out in the Constitution.
Recognizing the complexity o f the sector and the critical importance o f “getting things right,” the
Government and development partners are working to ensure necessary international advisory support combined
with capacity building for Timorese counterparts.

D. Planning, Budgeting, Budget Execution and the Medium-TermFiscal Framework
18.
Since the restoration of independence, Timor-Leste has greatly improved planning and
budgeting skills. In the transition period, recurrent expenditures were budgeted and executed b y
UNTAET, through the Consolidated Fund for East Timor (CFET). The urgent need for
reconstruction and rehabilitation was addressed through the multi-donor Trust Fund for East
Timor (TFET)3-with investment expenditures implemented through Project Management Units
(PMUs) that followed Bank procurement and financial management procedures. Since the
restoration o f independence, Government has developed tools to link budgeting to the NDP. T o
this effect, every agency prepares an Annual Action Plan (AAP), which constitutes the basis for
budgeting. In support o f this effort, and recognizing Timor-Leste’s inability to collect sufficient
revenues ahead o f Bayu Undan petroleum production, the Bank and Timor-Leste’s other
development partners began to provide budget assistance to CFET immediately after the
restoration o f independence. The first Transition Support Program (TSP I)
provided a total o f
USD 32 million from ten partners for the Government’s FY03 budget. TSP Iwas accompanied
b y an action matrix distilled from the AAPs, and TSP I1 (USD 35 million) and TSP I11 (USD 31
million) continued this process. While this i s no small accomplishment, AAPs are s t i l l at an early
stage, and the Government struggles with the links between them, the budget, and especially
budget execution and outcomes.
19.
Timor-Leste performs well on fiduciary accountability, but this comes at a high cost to
service delivery. Timor-Leste meets 12 out of 15 HIPC tracking benchmarks. However, budget
execution i s very slow. Though commitment levels are reasonably high across all expenditure
categories, with total expenditures (cash plus commitments) averaging 93 percent in aggregate
terms in FY04, budget execution reached only 75 percent on a cash basis in that same year. Slow
budget execution i s due to heavy centralization o f expenditure management, tight expenditure
TFET i s a multi-donor trust fund that has supported reconstruction and development activities in Timor-Leste since
early 2000. TFET donors are Australia, the European Commission, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand,
Portugal, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the World Bank. The World Bank serves as Trustee, and
TFET projects are administered b y the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Country Context

10

and procurement controls, weak capacity in ministries, and poor communication between the
MPF and line ministries. There i s no effective disbursement system to send funds to the districts,
so that district staff hold no funds for supporting national programs or local service delivery,
Improving budget execution while maintaining accountability poses an essential challenge. A
more extensive discussion o f budget execution issues i s provided in Attachment A.
20.
The Government has begun to implement important measures to improve budget
execution. An inter-ministerial commission was established in April 2004 to address this issue.

The MPF has conducted a study on budget execution processes and causes o f spending
bottlenecks, the results o f which are eagerly awaited. For FY06, the Government has defined the
capital development budgets for several ministries in great detail, thus allowing for increased
transparency and monitoring in an attempt to address the need for proper checks and balances
over the use o f funds. In some ministries, the Government has begun to assign responsibility for
execution o f capital development budgets to staff and advisers who have developed capacity in
processing capital expenditures through implementation o f TFET-funded projects. This allows
for short-term improvements in budget execution while longer-term capacity in planning and
financial management i s being built. Other initiatives, such as enhancing coordination between
the MPF, line ministries, and districts, devolving spending responsibilities, and shifting from exante spending controls to ex-post audits may ease budget execution and guard against misuse o f
funds. Contracting out the delivery of services in some sectors and seeking creative partnerships
with non-government actors may also ease the burden on Government staff while capacity i s s t i l l
being developed. Finally, i f pilot programs on local block grant budgeting are successful, the
Government may want t o consider expanding them to other districts through increasing budget
allocations.
Following the launch of Bayu Undan petroleum production, the Govemment w i l l no
longer face the budget deficit experienced in the first three years of its existence and w i l l be able
to fund a sizable budget in perpetuity. Initially, from F Y 0 2 to the beginning o f FY05, the

21.

Government faced a financing gap o f approximately U S D 30 million annually out o f a total
budget of about USD 75 million. This gap was filled b y the TSP. N o w that Bayu Undan i s in full
production, Timor-Leste’s budget can grow gradually - in accordance with the savings policy to the sustainable income level o f USD 130-170 million. Approximately two-thirds o f this w i l l
come from petroleum revenues while the remaining one-third w i l l come from non-petroleum
revenues. At the same time, petroleum savings are expected to accumulate rapidly in the
Petroleum Fund.4 In keeping with best practice, the accumulating balance w i l l safeguard the
provision o f essential public services for future generations.

In fact, consistent with the provisional savings policy, the balance of petroleum revenues has grown throughout the
transition period, and the pace of growth has accelerated since the launch of Bayu Undan.

Notes: FY06 expenditures include capitalization of the Banking and Payments Authority. Data on Central Government Cash Balances include
cash in provision of commitments that have been made but not spent during the course of the fiscal year. Under the transitory savings policy, the
Government allocated only royalties and the corresponding investment income to oil/gas savings, while petroleum tax revenues were channeled
to the budget. Given unusually high petroleum prices, this resulted in the accumulation of large central government cash balances in FY05.
Together with the interim oillgas savings from royalties, these are expected to be largely transferred to the Petroleum Fund once it is
established.

22.
I n order to eflectively plan combined sources spending and shift a greater proportion on
budget, the Govemment has asked development partners to support such a shift by continuing
whole-of-Government budget support for three more years. CFET spending (Table 1) accounts
for less than 50 percent o f the so-called Combined Sources Budget, which amounted to about
USD 200 million in FY05. Combined sources spending includes several off-budget sources: the
undisbursed balance o f TFET, bilateral donor funding, and UN assistance (Figure 2). M a n y o f
the bilateral and multilateral programs encompass expenditures that constitute core government
functions and are ultimately long-term liabilities, such as pharmaceuticals, educational materials,
and maintenance. Shifting these expenditures on budget w i l l allow the Government to address
the long-term sustainability issues o f combined sources spending, while focusing on
strengthening i t s own systems and procedures rather than on complying with multiple donor
procedures. At the Government’s request, the proposed budget support program for FY06-08
w i l l henceforth be known as the Consolidation Support Program (CSP I111), reflecting the move
f r o m a period o f transition to the consolidation o f gains achieved so far (Figure 3). The CSP can
only become an attractive means of channeling donor assistance if budget execution capacity
improves.

E. Economic Outlook and Sources of Growth
23.
With the initiation of petroleum production, GNI is rising rapidly while per-capita GDP
is actually declining (Figure 4). Production in the Bayu Undan petroleum field began in early
2004, resulting in a sharp increase in GNI. In 1999, owing to the violence, non-petroleum GDP
dropped 35 percent. Growth recovered to reach 15 percent in 2000 and 17 percent in 2001, but
then fell b y about 6 percent in both 2002 and 2003. In 2004, GDP grew only modestly at under 2
percent. Given that the population i s growing at well over 3 percent, per-capita GDP has
declined steadily to U S D 366 in 2004, which indicates that poverty has most likely increased.
The recovery in the early years of the transition was fuelled b y high public expenditures,
supported b y unprecedented levels o f aid and a large international presence. Aid peaked at USD
300 per capita in FY02, but has since tapered o f f to U S D 175 per capita in FY04 and i s expected
to remain at a similar level for the foreseeable future. Given the emergency character o f the aid
interventions and the particularly l o w level o f local capacity, a sizeable share o f development
assistance, probably upward o f 50 percent, has been spent on international salaries and fees,
much o f which does not benefit the local economy.

Urban areas suffer from high unemployment. In 2001, unemployment reached 20 percent
in Dili and Baucau, compared to 5 percent nationwide. Unemployment has most probably
increased since then. M o r e than 10,000 youngsters j o i n the labor market every year. With the
restoration o f independence, the role o f the public sector as a source o f employment has
decreased significantly. The Indonesian public service had 26,000 employees in the territory,
excluding the military, while the Government o f Timor-Leste has only 17,000 public service
posts, including the armed forces.
25.
I n rural areas productivity is very low. Agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry
make up 80 percent of all self-employment, but only 30 percent o f non-petroleum GDP. Thirtythree percent of households rely o n subsistence agriculture alone. Since the restoration o f
independence, farmers have had to adjust to a sea change in the role o f the public sector,
including the loss o f subsidies, extension services, and markets. Guaranteed purchases o f

Country Context

13

essential commodities at subsidized prices were eliminated, and public sector staff devoted to
agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry declined from 6,000 under the Indonesian
administration to an estimated 400 in FY06. Before the restoration o f independence, the presence
o f thousands o f Indonesian soldiers and civil servants constituted a large and reliable market for
agricultural and other goods throughout the territory, which has since dissipated. Environmental
degradation i s a significant problem, which w i l l have an increasing impact on agricultural
productivity in coming years. The rapidly growing and dispersing population puts tremendous
pressure on agricultural land, much o f which i s situated on steep slopes. This i s exacerbated b y
accelerated deforestation following the substitution o f kerosene b y firewood, the latter now being
the most important energy source for 98 percent o f households. Attachment B provides more
detail on environmental issues in Timor-Leste.
Petroleum is Timor-Leste ’s most prominent source of growth. Timor-Leste and i t s
26.
surrounding waters harbor considerable petroleum reserves. Their exploitation i s affected b y the
absence o f a permanent border demarcation between Timor-Leste and Australia, commonly
referred to as the “Timor Gap.” As a temporary measure, the two countries continue to respect
the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) previously established between Indonesia and
Australia. The terms o f the associated Timor Sea Treaty were re-negotiated, allocating 90
percent o f the public revenues generated b y the JPDA to Timor-Leste. Under these
arrangements, Timor-Leste w i l l earn an estimated USD 5.8 billion in public revenue over the
next 20 years. The JPDA covers the entire Bayu Undan field, which i s in production, but only
part o f the Greater Sunrise fields, and none o f the several smaller fields in the Timor Sea. TimorLeste claims much o f the territory containing these fields, and the two countries have launched
negotiations with a view to drawing permanent boundaries or otherwise finding a satisfactory
temporary solution to the dispute. Finally, i t i s expected that there are considerable reserves in
non-disputed territory. Licensing for onshore and offshore reserves along Timor-Leste’s southern
coast i s expected to begin in early 2006. Timor-Leste thus stands to gain several billion dollars in
additional future petroleum revenue.

27.

Timor-Leste hopes to attract industry associated with petroleum production, but this will
not be a sustained source of large-scale employment. Timor-Leste would l i k e to see Greater

Sunrise developed b y routing a pipeline from the field to the southern coast o f Timor-Leste,
rather than to Australia’s northern coast. This routing would result in the development of port
facilities, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing plant, and power-generating infrastructure on
Timorese soil, and would bring about additional tax benefits from these downstream activities.
This development would also make Timor-Leste an attractive location for methanol and fertilizer
production. The construction activities associated with this option would generate substantial
short-term employment. Yet neither the petroleum exploitation nor the associated chemical
industry w i l l be significant long-term sources o f employment, as both are intensive in technology
and capital rather than labor.
28.

It will be critical in both the short and long term to focus on non-petroleum sector

growth. In the coming years, the main source o f non-oil growth i s likely to be the public sector,

and appropriate fiscal policy w i t h a view to aggregate demand management w i l l be an important
tool o f Government policy. The most effective way to increase non-petroleum GDP and to create
jobs in the short term i s through improved execution o f the Government’s budget, with an
emphasis on labor-intensive programs. The proposed CFET budget for FY06-08 includes more

Country Context

14

than USD 20 million (almost triple the FY05 amount) in construction expenditures annually, to
build schools, health posts, and hospitals, and to rehabilitate and maintain roads. The effective
and prompt implementation o f these budgeted expenditures would imply the employment of
several thousand low-skilled workers in the districts, mostly through the contracting o f smalland medium-sized local construction companies or through community works (Box 3).
B o x 3: C r e a t i n g Jobs t h r o u g h I m p l e m e n t a t i o n of the Capital Development B u d g e t

Capital development spending i s expected to grow from USD 8.7 million in FY05 to USD 24.4 million in
FY06, nearly tripling in size (excluding recapitalization of the BPA). I f fully executed, the FY06 capital
development budget of USD 24.4 million could create over 3,000 short-term jobs for low-skilled laborers in the year
ahead. This rough estimate i s based on the proportional cost o f labor in projects implemented under TFET and on an
average monthly wage o f USD 85.

To address the acute and growing problems of unemployment and low rural productivity

more sustainably, the country w i l l need to develop private sector labor-intensive activities,
particularly in rural areas where 86 percent of poor people live. Labor-intensive activities can
target both internal (food) and external markets (niche products). Coffee, for example, i s TimorLeste’s primary non-petroleum export. Approximately 28 percent o f households earn some
income from coffee. Approximately one-third of the crop fetches a 20 to 100 percent mark-up for
high quality, organic, and/or fair trade certification, indicating that there i s ample room for
income gains through quality enhancement. Candlenut, organic vanilla, and livestock are slowly
gaining importance as export products. An organic coconut oil-pressing plant began production
and export to Australia at the end o f 2004; the largest new source of rural private sector
employment since the restoration o f independence, the plant employs 200 workers and buys from
more than 1,000 small coconut growers. Teak, sandalwood, bamboo, and rattan are potential
forestry products. Eco-adventure tourism, including diving, fishing, and bird-watching, may have
some potential as Timor-Leste i s breathtakingly beautiful and s t i l l unspoiled. A small flow of
tourists has begun to visit Timor-Leste, and there are budding tMrist-oriented services, such as
tour operators and dive companies. The Government has recently launched a new tourism
promotion website, and Lonely Planet has published the first guidebook for Timor-Leste. The
Government has created an overseas employment program and signed an agreement with a South
Korean company to send an initial group o f 100 to 200 workers abroad in mid-2005. An
extension of this program to other countries i s expected to create 3,000 new jobs for Timorese

Country Context

15

workers over the next three years. A more aggressive use o f labor mobility programs may be
hampered b y the l o w s k i l l level o f the Timorese labor force.

F. Private and Financial Sector
30,
Private initiative is considered the main source of future employment, but business faces
formidable obstacles in Timor-Leste. The Government has consistently underlined the need for

rapid private sector development, which i t sees as the only sustainable form o f j o b creation, a
180-degree turnaround from the Indonesian occupation when the public sector constituted the
main source o f employment. Five Business Development Centers, supported under TFET, have
started training programs on entrepreneurship, but an incomplete regulatory framework, unclear
and cumbersome administrative procedures, high costs for labor and electricity, poorly
developed infrastructure, and growing corruption pose significant challenges to business
development.
Znfrastructure is poorly developed, and factor costs are high. The road network, while
31.
extensive, i s in very poor condition. Commercial air transport to and from Timor-Leste i s
expensive, at between U S D 275 and U S D 550, and non-existent within the country. However,
the first national private carrier began operations between Dili and Kupang in West Timor for
U S D 100 per return ticket, and increased competition may lead to lower prices. Timor-Leste’s
electricity supply i s among the most costly in the world at 20cts/kwh for commercial users.
Access to electricity in district capitals i s at best limited to a few hours per night, and most o f the
rural population has no access to power at all. Telecommunications are expensive, with phone
calls ranging from 12 cents to 36 cents per minute, compared to between three and nine cents per
minute in Indonesia. In rural areas, the mobile telephone network i s patchy, and there are no
landlines beyond major towns. Since the UNTAET period, USD 85 a month became an informal
minimum wage. Though wages for unskilled labor tend to be lower outside Dili and for small
informal companies in the capital, they are several times higher than in the rest of the region
even though labor productivity i s low.

Solid progress has been made in completing the regulatory framework for private sector
development, but the associated administrative procedures are unclear and cumbersome. The

law on commercial societies, the insurance law, and the domestic and foreign investment laws
have all been promulgated. Laws on payments and bankruptcy are currently under development.
While this progress i s laudable, in practice businesses face weak administration and rule of law.
The process for business registration i s complex and unclear. Customs procedures are lengthy,
creating unnecessary administrative hurdles. Increasingly, businesses also complain o f
harassment and corruption. The justice system remains particularly weak w i t h regard to the
resolution of c i v i l cases. At the end o f 2004, the Court o f Appeals alone had a backlog o f 34 c i v i l
cases and had only ever resolved three. A framework law on land and property rights has been
promulgated, as has a decree law on the leasing o f Government property. The corresponding law
on the leasing o f private property i s under consideration b y Parliament, and laws on land dispute
mediation, land rights and title restitution, and foreign owner compliance are in progress.
Implementation o f these laws w i l l depend significantly on future progress in cadastral work and
the registration o f titles.

Timor-Leste ’s financial sector, particularly commercial banking, has expanded rapidly
since 2003. There are now three commercial banks in operation. Lending i s growing at a fast
pace, with a seven-fold increase in bank loans between January 2003 and March 2004. As o f
January 2005, the largest bank, Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU), held U S D 63 million in

outstanding loans to about 10,000 borrowers, representing approximately 19 percent o f GDP.
This lending activity has contributed considerably to growth in private and business assets in
Dili. Financial services are not widely available outside the capital, although they are growing.
BNU has opened offices in two secondary towns, makes monthly visits to all district capitals,
and plans to extend branches to all districts b y early 2006. Microfinance, which operates mostly
outside Dili, i s also gaining momentum, with four specialized microfinance institutions, several
savings and credit cooperatives, and an Association o f Microfinance Institutions in operation.
They hold deposits and loans totaling only about 0.3 percent o f GDP, but serve an estimated
20,000 low-income clients. While there are institutions serving the high and l o w ends o f the
market, there i s a vacuum in “second-tier” services. The supply o f credit for agricultural
production and equipment i s the least developed among financial services products.

G. Poverty Profile
34.
With a per-capita GDP of USD 366, Timor-Leste is among the poorest countries in the
world. As GDP per capita has declined, poverty has most likely increased. In 2001, one in five
people lived on less than one dollar per day, and two in five lived below the national poverty

line. The 200 1 Poverty Assessment also documented considerable inequality. The poorest 40
percent of the population had an expenditure share o f no more than 18 percent. There i s a
significant difference in poverty between urban and rural areas, and across geographic zones.
Fourteen percent o f the population in the urban areas o f Dili and Baucau live below the poverty
line, compared to 40 percent in other urban areas and 47 percent in rural areas. Eighty-six
percent of poor people live in rural areas, where households experience insufficiencies in rice
and corn approximately four months per year, on average. Among rural households, poverty
tends to be worse in the highlands, which explains why poverty and other indicators of wellbeing are worse in the central and western regions than in the less mountainous east. Poverty i s
highest in households in which the head o f household i s engaged only in farming (49 percent), as
opposed to wage employment (19 percent) or a household business (17 percent).

Although gradual progress has been made since the restoration of independence, TimorLeste lags behind the rest of the region in achieving the MDGs (Figure 5). The Demographic and

Health Survey (DHS), the 2001 Poverty As~essment,~
and the 2003 Multi-Indicator Cluster
Survey (MICS) highlight the daunting social challenges the country faces (Table 2). T w o out o f
every five adults in Timor-Leste are illiterate. Access to education has increased dramatically
over time, especially for the poor, with net primary enrollment rates reaching about 80 percent.
More poor children and more girls are in school now compared to the situation under the
Indonesian occupation. However, net secondary school enrollment i s only 30 percent. About one
child in ten never goes to school. Health indicators are improving gradually. Most notably, the
mortality rate for children under five has declined f r o m 165 per 1,000 live births in the period
1989-1993 to 83 per 1,000 in the period 1999-2003. Yet half o f children under five are stunted,
and approximately two out o f every five non-pregnant women and one out of every four men
have a l o w body-mass index. H I V / A I D S prevalence i s very low, but the population i s
dangerously unaware o f the risks. Considerable interaction between high-risk groups such as sex
workers and homosexuals and otherwise low-risk groups create clear bridges to the broader
population. Four out o f five women have never heard o f HIV/AIDS, with the ratio only slightly
lower for men. Access to water and electricity i s limited, particularly in rural areas, which

Potential Assessment, and the Household Survey. Analysis o f the findings i s presented in Poverty in a New Nation:

disproportionately affects poor people. In urban areas, around 70 percent of the population has
access to electricity and safe drinking water, whereas in rural areas, access rates are 43 percent
for drinking water and 11 percent for electricity. Forty-six percent o f the population has no
exposure to mass media.

Population growth and movement create formidable challenges for service delivery. At
7.8 children per woman o f child-bearing age, Timor-Leste has one o f the highest fertility rates in
the world. The corresponding population growth rate i s estimated at well over 3 percent. I f this
rate i s maintained, the current population o f 925,000 i s expected to double in 17 years.
Moreover, there has been significant urban migration in the last five years, with Dili’s population
growing b y 39 percent since 2001. In rural areas, some people have left the coastal plains where
they were relocated b y the Indonesian administration to return to ancestral homes in more
remote, highland areas. These factors present tremendous challenges to the delivery o f services
in health, education, and infrastructure, and enhance the risk o f serious environmental
degradation.
37.
The combination of a rapidly expanding population, inequality, and slow growth indicate
that poverty is likely to increase in the medium term. Projections o f poverty under various
scenarios for GDP growth, inequality, and population growth presented in the Poverty
Assessment illustrate the interdependence o f these factors. Under a scenario o f 4 percent real
GDP growth, constant inequality, and an unchanged population growth rate o f 2.4 percent, the
Poverty Assessment estimates that the poverty headcount would fall from 40 to 30 percent b y
2007. However, a scenario o f sluggish growth, with all else equal, implies a constant poverty
headcount o f 40 percent in 2007. Scenarios for rising inequality and population growth, with all
else equal, imply a reduction in the headcount to only 35 and 33 percent, respectively. In reality,
Timor-Leste faces a combination o f sluggish growth, rising inequality, and a rapidly expanding
population, implying that the poverty headcount may be expected to increase by 2007. Unless
measures are taken to stimulate growth outside the petroleum sector, non-petroleum GDP growth
w i l l at best keep up with population growth, seriously limiting Timor-Leste’s chances to achieve
the poverty reduction MDG b y 2015. In the areas o f education, health, and gender, however, the
Government i s making steady progress toward achievement o f the MDGs.
H. Youth
38.
Providing a future for Timor-Leste’s rapidly growing youth population is one of the
country’s principal challenges. More than 50 percent o f the population i s under the age o f 15,
with this proportion projected to grow. Urban youth unemployment was 43 percent in 2001, and
has probably increased. Many youth lack basic skills, as net secondary school enrollment rates
are only 30 percent. Encouragingly, rural youth see activities in agriculture, fisheries, and
forestry as promising professions, but there i s an unmet demand for vocational training. Among
young women, the DHS has documented a drop in age at first marriage and age at first birth, as
compared to previous generations. In addition, some o f the most serious health problems mainly
concern youth. Cases o f trauma following road accidents represent 25 percent o f hospital bed
occupancy, and about half o f these are youth under 25. Youth are easily drawn into gang
violence, as witnessed b y the growth o f martial arts groups; fights between such groups have
resulted in destruction o f property and several deaths since 2000.

Country Context

20

I.Gender

39.
Timor-Leste is determined to overcome the numerous social and demographic obstacles
to the promotion of equality and gender balance. Timor-Leste has one o f the highest maternal
mortality rates in the region, estimated at 420 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1999. Only 45
percent o f women are literate, compared to 54 percent o f men. Although enrollment rates are
equal for boys and girls in primary and lower secondary school, a gender gap emerges in higher

secondary and tertiary education. The incidence of domestic violence and sexual assault i s high
in Timor-Leste. Cases of gender-based violence are being brought to court and have been
successfully prosecuted, which represents a significant improvement over the Indonesian era
when such cases did not even reach the courts. However, victims face significant challenges in
the court system, as witnessed b y the large backlog and long processing time o f cases brought b y
women. Women are prominently represented in Government and Parliament. The Senior
Minister to the Council o f Ministers, who i s also the Minister o f State Administration, the
Minister o f Planning and Finance, and the Vice-Ministers o f Planning and Finance, Education,
and State Administration are all women. Twenty-six percent o f parliamentarians are women, a
significantly higher share than in many OECD countries. Reflecting a concerted effort b y
Government to involve women, several ran in recent local elections, and a number of them were
elected. Nevertheless, strong cultural biases are an obstacle to women assuming leadership roles
and participating in decision making at community and family levels.

111. TIMOR-LESTE’S DEVELOPMENT VISION
40.

Timor-Leste’s NDP, SP, and SIPs set forth the Government’s vision for national
development (Box 4). The NDP was adopted on the eve o f Timor-Leste’s restoration to
independence in 2002, and approved b y the Parliament shortly thereafter. I t defines sustainable
growth and poverty reduction as i t s overriding goals. Government further sharpened i t s
Box 4: Timor-Leste’s NDP - Our National Vision for 2020

Timor-Leste will be a democratic country with a vibrant traditional culture and a
sustainable environment.
I t will be a prosperous society with adequate food, shelter and clothing for a l l people.
Communities will live in safety, with no discrimination.
People will be literate, knowledgeable and skilled. They will be healthy and live a long,
productive life. They will actively participate in economic, social and political
development, promoting social equality and national unity.
People will no longer be isolated because there will be good roads, transport, electricity,
and communication in the towns and villages, in a l l regions of the country.
Production and employment will increase in all sectors - agriculture, fisheries and
forestry.
Living standards and services will improve for all East Timorese and income will be
fairly distributed.
Prices will be stable and food supplies secure, based on sound management and
sustainable utilization of natural resources.
The economy and finances of the state will be managed efficiently, transparently and
will be free of corruption.
The State will be based on the rule of law. Government, private sector, civil society and
community leaders will be fully responsible to those by whom they were chosen or
elected.
itization o f medium-term goals in the SP, developed in the wake o f the riots in D i in
December 2002. The SP prioritizes Government activities under three objectives: good
governance, stability through j o b creation, and poverty reduction through education and health
services. As an additional set o f planning instruments, Government has recently developed 17
SIPs, which provide detailed plans to guide combined sources expenditure in each sector. The
Government i s in the process o f establishing joint Government-donor Sector Working Groups
(SWGs) for SIP implementation and monitoring. SWGs in agriculture, infrastructure, and health
have been launched.

41.
The NDP, SP and SIPs were recently presented to the Boards of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a poverty reduction strategy. The Joint Staff Advisory
Note (JSAN) commended the comprehensiveness o f Timor-Leste’s planning instruments, but
noted that the NDP poverty reduction goals and targets are over-ambitious. While applauding the
genuine efforts to link planning and budgeting, the J S A N suggested that planning and budgeting
be linked to monitoring outcomes, and that the SWGs fully develop their monitoring function. I t
recommended bringing about improved service delivery through institutional capacity building
and partnerships. I t highlighted weaknesses in governance as an emerging issue and suggested an
early focus on the justice sector and customs administration. I t stressed the need for the early
enactment o f measures to improve the legislative and regulatory environment for businesses.

IV. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
42.

The Bank’s early engagement in Timor-Leste has yielded a multitude of information and
lessons for its work in post-conflict countries. The experience in Timor-Leste has helped to shape
the Bank’s-and the development community’s-thinking on approaches in post-conflict and
fragile states. While lessons o f experience are s t i l l being learned, this section highlights some of

the successes and failures, which are equally valuable in guiding the Bank’s strategy going
forward.

A. Strong Partnerships for a Whole-of-Government,Results-OrientedApproach
43.
From the outset, strong strategic partnerships were forged. In the fall of 1999, a Joint
Assessment Mission (JAM) was fielded, which comprised equal numbers o f Timorese leaders
and representatives from five bilateral donor countries, the European Commission (EC), UN
agencies, the ADB, and the World Bank. The J A M identified priority reconstruction objectives
across sectors and provided estimates o f external financing needs. As a result, TFET was
established in December 1999. Guided b y the April 2000 TSS, this multi-donor t r u s t fund
financed projects in key sectors, including agriculture, economic and institutional capacity
building, education, health, small enterprise development, roads, power, water, microfinance,
and petroleum sector technical assistance.
44.

Timor-Leste pioneered the model of focused assistance in a post-conflict transition on the
basis of a Transitional Results M a t r i x 6 Donor partnerships with UNTAET and transitional

Governments were guided b y an action matrix discussed at the biannual development partner
meetings, which were co-chaired b y UNTAET and the Bank. The action matrix provided a timebound framework for monitoring all critical achievements, irrespective of the specific mandates
and interests o f individual financing partners. Activities were thus able to cover areas o f critical
importance to the emerging nation that were, for example, outside the Bank’s mandate, such as
conducting elections, outlining the schedule for adoption o f the Constitution, and maintaining
security.

45.

Since the restoration of independence, the Government has taken f i r m leadership over the
coordination of development activities and chaired the Timor-Leste and Development Partners
Meeting (TLDPM) with the assistance of the Bank. Building on experience with the Transitional

Results Matrix, the TSP was guided b y an action matrix distilled from the Government’s AAPs,
which served to maintain the results-oriented approach around a whole-of Government
partnership with the donor community. The matrix and the biannual joint donor TSP progress
missions became the backbone o f policy dialogue between Government and development
partners. The Government has praised the TSP for respecting ownership, building capacity in
prioritizing interventions, sharing lessons from across the world, exploiting the synergies among
development partners, and providing a framework for international accountability.

46.
The Bank has earned the trust of the Government and donors in its role as a strategic
partner. This i s notable in the context o f the Government’s adherence to a no-borrowing policy

and the Bank’s relatively small financial contributions, amounting to about USD 30 million in
See United Nations Development Group and World Bank, An Operational Note on Transitional Results Matrices:
Using Results-Based Frameworks in Fragile States, January 2005.

Lessons of Experience

24

grants between FYOO and FY05. Through i t s donor coordination efforts, the Bank has leveraged
this comparatively small funding to mobilize significant resources from development partners,
channeled through multi-donor mechanisms such as TFET and the TSP. Given i t s close
involvement in these coordinated mechanisms, the Bank’s achievements are measured b y those
o f the donor community as a whole. Attachment C provides a more thorough assessment of the
Bank’s program over the past five years, including information on the active portfolio.

B. Lessons Learned for the CAS
47.
The most pertinent lessons learned, which have been taken into account in the design o f
the CAS program-and particularly in the principles o f engagement b y which the program w i l l
operate-include :
A whole-of-Govemment approach around a results matrix, as embodied in the TSP/CSP is
critical to nation building in a post-conflict environment. The Bank’s catalytic role in
bringing donors together has been crucial in fostering a whole-of-Government approach to
development, and should be maintained independent o f the Government’s borrowing policy.
Continued emphasis on donor coordination w i l l be crucial, as the whole-of-Government
approach has depended upon active engagement on the part o f a broad set of development
partners who together support the Government in implementing its policies. The result o f this
coordination has been far greater than the sum o f i t s parts. Through the whole-ofGovernment approach, attention w i l l need to be paid to emerging issues that w i l l shape the
country’s future, notably youth and gender.
I t is important to strike a balance between addressing emergency needs and planning for the

long term. Given the overwhelming demands created b y the destruction in 1999, international
attention tended to center on the emergency. In many instances immediate, basic needs in
particular sectors were met, but the focus on emergency assistance sacrificed longer-term,
more integrated, sustainable results (Table 3). With hindsight, i t i s clear that sectors that were

disciplined early on in planning for the transition, such as health, are reaping the benefits
now. They were able to build an institutional architecture, with associated human resources,
to anticipate future needs. Long-term planning i s also important to avoid hasty decisions that,
down the line, may hinder economic development.

Lessons of Experience

T a b l e 3: Agency Achievements

Key:

+++ = clear progress made; ++ = partial progress made; + = weak progress made; NA = not applicable

Institutional capacity development has been the Achilles ’ heel of donor assistance in TimorLeste. While essential services were re-launched rapidly and physical reconstruction

proceeded at a fairly rapid pace, institution building for sustainable service delivery has
advanced much more slowly and remains limited. Sector institution building remains a
tremendous challenge and needs to be a primary objective going forward, taking into account
the varying levels o f progress across agencies to date. As short-term growth and j o b creation
will depend on more effective budget implementation, an integrated program o f capacity
building in planning and financial management, underpinning efforts in all sectors, i s needed.
At the same time, i t w i l l be important to address specific capacity development needs in the
context of sector programs.

Capacity building has been most effective when part of a clearly defined path for institutional
development. Successful agencies, such as the Ministry o f Health, the Banking and Payments
Authority, the Ministry o f State Administration, and, increasingly, the Ministry o f

Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry, have benefited from strong national leadership with a
clear vision, which has in turn strengthened ownership. Early on, these agencies adopted
sound policies and strategies and developed institutional and legal frameworks and
associated systems and processes, allowing them to function within a well-defined structure
in pursuit o f clearly specified goals. They concentrated on a small set o f sector-wide input
and output targets to guide their work. Well-functioning agencies adopted a holistic approach
to human resource development, including the deployment o f international staff combined
with training, both on-the-job and abroad, of national staff within local systems and
processes and with an explicit succession plan. They adopted a management culture fostering
delegation and empowerment. Finally, these agencies have benefited from joint donor
support for a nationwide program o f capacity building.

Lessons of Experience

26

Improvements in sewice delivery will depend on a stronger results orientation. Despite solid
progress since the restoration o f independence, results on the ground remain limited,
especially in the districts. To curb this situation, S I P implementation w i l l be need to be
guided b y output and outcome indicators, possibly coordinated in the context o f SWGs. The

health sector provides a good model for this approach. Successful monitoring and evaluation
of outcomes depends on timely, high-quality AAA combined with an effective
communications strategy. The more pro-active use o f creative partnerships between
Government, NGOs, the private sector, and communities i s also important to achieve
outcomes on the ground (Box 5).
Box 5: Lafaek - Improving Education through Creative Partnerships

One o f the most successful examples o f creative partnerships between the Government and NGOs comes in the
guise o f a children’s magazine. Named “Lafaek” after the country’s national symbol, the crocodile, this magazine i s
the only mass-circulated publication in Tetun. Reaching an estimated 200,000 school children around the country,
Lafaek promotes literacy and provides a variety of information on Government development programs, ranging
from nutrition to building roads to strengthening democracy. The magazine also publishes traditional short stories
and previously unavailable information about the history, geography, culture, and languages o f Timor-Leste.
Since 2001, 19 editions of Lafaek have been published and circulated, including special issues on agriculture,
health and hygiene, and civic education. The magazine i s produced every two months during the school year. A
junior edition, Lafaek Ki’ik, has recently been created. Beginning in July 2002, Radio Lafaek was launched on 18
community radio stations, covering similar themes and topics as the magazine and featuring children’s music and
stories. The Lafaek Project also includes a pen pal program connecting over 500 school classes, comprising about
6,000 children across the country.
In remote areas, Lafaek i s the only available reading material for school children and thus serves as an
important educational tool. Each issue i s accompanied b y a teacher’s guide that provides more detailed information
on key topics as well as suggestions for in-class activities. A team o f thirteen field officers ensures distribution to all
areas in Timor-Leste by personally delivering magazines on motorbikes.
Lafaek i s produced and distributed b y CARE International in close collaboration with the Ministry of
Education, Culture, Youth, and Sports (MECYS), and i s supported by the E C and the TFET-financed Fundamental
School Quality Project (FSQP). The Government o f Timor-Leste has indicated i t s interest in taking over funding for
this highly successful program o f community outreach and education.

I n a nation-building context where many of the achievements made have been invisible to the
population, two-way communication and transparency are critical. Reaching out to actors
within and beyond Government i s crucial to building awareness o f achievements, generating

understanding about obstacles, and creating a sense o f belonging. Enhancing the availability
of accessible information on the budget and Government operations i s important in sharing
progress and in stimulating a country-wide dialogue on development priorities. Strengthening
consultation among various agencies within Government helps to ensure consistency in
policies and programs. Improving the frequency and quality of public consultations builds
popular consensus and ownership over the development agenda (Box 6).

27

Lessons o f Experience

Box 6: Enhancing the Impact o f Analytical Work through Consultation - The National Education Congress
In October 2003, the MECYS organized the National Education Congress as a precursor to drafting the
National Education Policy. The preparation o f the Congress was guided b y a Steering Committee comprising the
Ministry, other important national stakeholders including religious organizations and the National Institute for
Linguistics, and development partners. The World Bank contributed to the Congress through the provision o f the
summary report, Timor-Leste Education: The Way Forward, which consolidated the results of the Primary School
Achievement Survey in a clear and readable format, discussing critical challenges in the education sector and laying
out strategies for meeting those challenges in the years ahead. The report was translated into Tetun and distributed to
congress participants.
The congress was meticulously prepared b y nine working groups focusing on basic education; secondary and
vocational and technical education; tertiary education; non-formal education and literacy; curriculum; teacher
training; language of instruction; community participation and private sector involvement; and education finance.
The working groups included representatives o f Government, religious organizations, national and international
NGOs, and other civil society stakeholders.
About 600 teachers, headmasters, parents, and other stakeholders, representing schools throughout the territory
attended the three-day conference in October 2003 They discussed the nine themes in small groups, formulated
recommendations for the Ministry, and discussed them in plenary sessions. The Congress’ recommendations form
the basis o f the Education Policy, which i s currently being finalized by the Ministry.

V. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY: CREATING CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE
GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION
A. Overview
48.

Despite solid progress and excellent performance for a post-conflict country, TimorLeste faces tremendous challenges to achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction. In

recognition o f the multi-faceted challenges facing Timor-Leste, the CAS w i l l continue the
whole-of-Government approach in support o f the NDP and SP, underpinned b y three strategic
pillars: (a) delivering sustainable services; (b) creating productive employment; and (c)
strengthening governance. The cross-sectoral issues o f youth and gender w i l l be mainstreamed
across these pillars. The CAS w i l l also emphasize four principles o f engagement across the
pillars: (a) building institutional capacity; (b) deepening the results orientation; (c) strengthening
transparency and communication; and (d) consolidating and extending the strong partnerships
that have been established with development partners. These pillars and principles received wide
support during extensive consultations on the CAS (Box 7). T o provide the Government with the
assistance i t needs to achieve i t s development objectives, the CAS depends on a continuation of
the high levels of donor leverage and coordination achieved thus far.
Box 7: CAS Consultations

Before developing the CAS, the team held extensive consultations throughout the country, emphasizing remote
and poor locations. The consultations were conducted in 40 villages, with participants from at least 110 hamlets,
representing 18 sub-districts in 9 different districts. The consultations focused on the Bank’s interventions between
2000 and 2004 and revealed that communities put a premium on community involvement in planning, transparency,
and use o f local labor in executing development programs. People noted an increased awareness o f the importance
of education since the restoration o f independence, and indicated that they would like to see more resources devoted
to education at the local level. In health, the mobile clinics were particularly appreciated, and there i s considerable
demand for more community-level health posts. Participants also expressed appreciation for the wide reach of the
Community Empowerment Project (CEP), which has been the only program in Timor-Leste to reach virtually every
village and has been described as having reached those “who really needed help.. .” The CEP, which was financed
b y TFET and which closed in March 2004, was well received for i t s transparent approach and its participatory
planning, reporting, and implementation processes.
I n refining the CAS, the team held a series o f consultations over the draft strategy and results matrix.
Stakeholder groups included the Government, Office o f the President, the economics and finance committee o f the
National Parliament, the private sector, international and national NGOs, academics, religious groups, youth, and
development partners. Participants expressed broad support for the strategic pillars and principles o f engagement.
National stakeholders, including NGOs and the private sector, conveyed serious concerns about corruption and its
negative effects on service delivery and private investment. International NGOs stressed the need for a stronger
focus on delivering services to the districts, combined with improved monitoring and evaluation at the district level.
Private sector representatives highlighted the need for training o f current as well as prospective entrepreneurs.
Various groups provided useful feedback on how better to mainstream youth and gender throughout the program.

49.
The approach is deliberately broad-based. Because Timor-Leste i s a new country and
the challenges i t faces are inextricably linked, i t i s critical to move forward on several fronts to
meet growth and poverty reduction goals. Delivering sustainable services in health and education
directly improves human development, while contributing to a better educated and healthier
work force. Improved access to electricity and roads i s essential for business development and

j o b creation. Creating productive employment for Timor-Leste’s rapidly growing population i s
essential to maintaining peace and stability. Good governance i s o f the utmost importance for the
sound management o f petroleum revenue, and the Bank w i l l continue to support the Government
in implementing i t s prudent petroleum fiscal and savings regime. Strengthening governance i s
also critical to ensure the effective implementation o f the budget, which i s the chief instrument
for delivering services. Improved budget execution can contribute considerably to growth and
employment creation in the short-term. Finally, good governance supports private sector
development by streamlining and improving the interactions between the public sector and
private enterprise.

50.

Supporting instruments for the CAS include whole-of-Government programs
complemented by sector-specific operations in select areas. The CAS embodies an innovative
business model for the Bank’s support to Timor-Leste’s NDP, SP, and SIPS-despite the
Government’s no-borrowing policy, the Bank w i l l remain engaged through the coordination o f
international partnerships, supported b y grants and AAA. The CAS w i l l be built around wholeof-Government budget support, delivered through the CSP; a joint donor program for capacity
building in planning and financial management; and sectoral operations in areas where the Bank
has built up expertise through TFET: agriculture, education, health, private sector development,
and energy.

51.
Annual budget support is envisaged to continue under the CSP for an additional three
years, from FY06 to FY08. The CSP w i l l continue the TSP’s support o f the SP pillars: service
delivery for poverty reduction, particularly in health and education; job creation through private
sector development and agriculture; and good governance, including the establishment o f
oversight arrangements, the effective implementation o f the petroleum sector arrangements,
public sector and public expenditure management, and strengthening capacity in the justice
sector. Given the importance o f basic infrastructure for improved service delivery and private
sector development in the districts, the CSP w i l l include activities in the power sector, focusing
on electrification in the districts and improved efficiency in Dili; the transport sector, especially
road maintenance and capacity in the local construction sector; and the water sector, with a view
to improving the water supply and increasing the autonomy o f the Water and Sanitation Service
(WSS). The CSP w i l l be designed to consolidate the strengths o f the TSP approach, while
working to improve the balance between ambition and realism and between accountability and
service delivery. The CSP w i l l also seek to deepen the results orientation and enhance
transparency.
52.
I n order to confront weaknesses in budget execution, budget support will be twinned with
a new whole-of Government multi-donor grant-funded program of capacity building for
accountable financial management in support of service delivery. In support o f the S I P for
Public Sector Management, the Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program
(PFMCBP) w i l l provide targeted capacity building to the MPF and to financial management
functions in line ministries and the districts. Design o f this program w i l l take into account past
experience in technical assistance and staff training programs, facilitating an effective transition
from the current heavy reliance on international staff in advisory and line positions to a longerterm solution. If and when Government budget execution improves considerably, the Bank
would consider channeling a higher proportion o f i t s assistance through the CSP and recommend
the same to other development partners.

Activities listed in bold print are new programs; the others are ongoing. Programs in italics are dependent on
external events. GEF, CDCF, and B C F programs w i l l be developed if Timor-Leste ratifies relevant international
conventions. Power sector lending would only be undertaken if the Government were to change its current noborrowing policy.

B a n k Assistance Strategy: Creating Conditions for
Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction

32

The CAS will also include targeted operations in support of the SIPS in areas where the
Bank has built expertise, notably health, education, energy, agriculture, and private sector
development. New programs to be launched during the CAS period include an Education For All

53.

Fast Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) program, an Energy Service Delivery Program (ESDP), and ECfunded programs in health and, possibly, agriculture. Additional new instruments may include
the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Bio-Carbon Fund (BCF), and Community Driven
Carbon Fund (CDCF) grant programs in energy and natural resources management, if the
Government becomes eligible b y ratifying the associated UN Conventions. If the Government
decides to opt for concessionary borrowing, the CAS program would be augmented by a lending
program for activities in the power sector with a high financial rate of return. Table 4 lays out the
grandlending program and supporting AAA envisaged over the CAS period in greater detail,
including ongoing operations in the portfolio.

54.

The Bank’s financial contribution to the CAS program is based on an indicative I D A
allocation of about USD 32 million over a three-year period. Approximately USD 25 million of

this amount would be provided on grant terms, with the remaining USD 7 million available as
loan financing were the Government to relax i t s no-borrowing policy. Under the current IDA14
rules, grant eligibility i s determined on the basis of debt sustainability. As Timor-Leste has not
accumulated any debt, i t would normally be ineligible for IDA grants; however, i t was granted
exceptional status to avoid a sudden shift o f status in comparison with other countries that
received IDA13 grants under the post-conflict criterion. The IDA allocation for FY06 i s firm, but
w i l l vary in FY07-08 depending on Timor-Leste’s performance in outer years. Timor-Leste w i l l
receive 100 percent o f i t s allocation on grant terms in FY06, 60 percent in FY07, and 30 percent
in FY08, at which point the country i s expected to be phased out o f grant eligibility. The amount
of IDA allocation has been determined according to Timor-Leste’s performance on Post-Conflict
Performance Indicators.

B. Results F r a m e w o r k
55.

The CAS is not merely a strategy for Bank assistance to Timor-Leste, but an agreed
strategy among development partners for coordinated support to the country. The CAS results
matrix (Annex B9) presents a three-year framework for the development community as a whole.

Donor partners have participated in the elaboration o f the results matrix and have agreed to work
together to achieve the objectives reflected in it. These ambitious goals w i l l only be attainable
through the strength o f partnerships forged thus far, which w i l l continue to grow and deepen.
This collaborative approach i s anchored b y the multi-donor CSP, through which Government
and development partners jointly monitor progress on an annual results matrix o f high-priority
actions. Though the program i s administered b y the World Bank, various development partners
take responsibility for supporting different elements o f the program, according to their
comparative advantage, mandate, interest, and expertise. Donor cooperation in the achievement
of CAS objectives w i l l also take shape through joint sector operations coordinated b y the SWGs.

C. D o n o r Coordination and Portfolio Management
56.
The strong partnerships developed over the transition w i l l be strengthened over the CAS
period. Partnerships w i l l be anchored in the CSP and w i l l also be extended to sector work in

Bank Assistance Strategy: Creating Conditions for
Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction

33

support of the SIPS and guided by the emerging SWGs. They, in turn, w i l l be guided by the
harmonization principles to which many of Timor-Leste’s development partners are committed.
Already, a group of development partners i s collaborating in the context of PFMCBP
preparation, with a view to adopting a joint Government-donor output framework and
implementation arrangements that will minimize transaction costs for the Government and use,
where feasible, country systems and processes. A similar approach w i l l be taken to designing and
implementing the EFA program. In the context of the CSP, donors have agreed to support the
improvement of combined sources budgeting by providing the Government with detailed
information on annual and medium-term aid commitments and disbursements, with appropriate
classifications and on a time-schedule appropriate to the Government’s budget cycle. Table 5
presents a breakdown of indicative IDA and other grant funding, as well as associated funding by
other development partners.

Country Financing Parameters (CFP) for Timor-Leste have been agreed with the Government,
which has welcomed the increased flexibility they would provide (Attachment D).
D. Strategic Pillars

51.

The CAS supports the strategic pillars of the Government's SP as a comprehensive
framework for shifting the focus from post-conflict assistance to sustainable growth and poverty
reduction. The three CAS pillars are a slightly modified version of those found in the SP: (a)

delivering sustainable services; (b) creating productive employment; and (c) strengthening
governance. Cross-cutting issues of youth and gender w i l l be mainstreamed throughout the
pillars. Each pillar i s outlined below, with associated CAS outcomes as set out in the results
framework. CAS program activities under each outcome are then explained in further detail.

Pillar 1: Delivering Sustainable Services
58.
The delivery o f sustainable services in both urban and rural areas w i l l be essential to
achieving the h4DGs and improving the livelihoods o f Timorese. The pressure on the social
sectors i s growing, as high fertility rates lead to high population growth. The CAS w i l l focus on
improving the coverage, quality, and service delivery focus o f priority sectors, such as education,
health, and basic infrastructure. Particular attention w i l l be given to achieving tangible results on
the ground, especially in rural areas. The CAS w i l l work toward the following outcomes:

Improved water supply for residents and businesses in urban and rural areas
Recognition o f veterans o f the resistance on the basis o f national consultations*

59.
I n education, CAS activities w i l l concentrate on improving access to and enhancing the
egiciency and quality of basic schooling. The Government has made considerable progress in
rebuilding the education system. Most schools have been rehabilitated, teachers are in place, and
student enrollment rates have grown. However, access to education in rural areas i s s t i l l difficult,
where long distances and lack o f transportation prevent some children from enrolling. School
fees affect the enrollment o f poor children. The efficiency o f education i s compromised by late
entry, high repetition and dropout rates, and absenteeism among teachers and students.
Improvements in the quality of education are also necessary. Student-teacher ratios have
decreased but remain high, teacher qualifications are variable, and there i s a lack o f familiarity
with the official language o f instruction, Portuguese. Serious deficiencies in the delivery o f
learning materials and school facilities compound these problems. Achievement tests show that

the quality o f primary education i s low, particularly in the area o f mathematics.’ In support of the
S I P for education and training, C A S activities w i l l focus on expanding the coverage, efficiency,
and quality o f education, particularly at the primary and pre-secondary levels, and on building
capacity for sector management. These goals w i l l be pursued through the continuation o f the
TFET-financed FSQP and an EFA program supported b y IDA, UNICEF, and EFA/FTI grants
and b y several bilateral partners. In focusing on primary education, the EFA program w i l l free up
Government resources to focus on other levels o f education. At the same time, the CAS w i l l
support the development o f a costed strategy for rationalization o f secondary and tertiary
education. The FSQP and the EFA program w i l l provide widespread improvement in access to
safe and comfortable learning environments and adequate water and sanitation facilities.
Enrollment w i l l be stimulated b y the abolishment o f school fees combined with the expansion o f
block grants for non-salary expenditures, and the targeted use o f school feeding programs in
impoverished communities. The EFA program w i l l focus on improving quality through a
program o f institutional capacity development, support to policy and planning, curriculum
enhancement, learning materials development, bilingual education, a pilot pre-school program to
introduce children to Tetun, teacher professional development and deployment, and a focus on
critical thinking and problem solving s k i l l s .

60.
I n health, the CAS will work to improve access to and quality and utilization of primary
health services. A great deal has been achieved in the health sector in a short time, including the

development o f a comprehensive policy framework with a priority focus on delivering affordable
and effective public health services in the districts and the establishment o f a system for district
health planning. Health facilities have been reconstructed and health outcomes have improved,
but further progress i s needed in expanding immunization coverage, improving maternal and
child health, increasing access to family planning services, enhancing awareness o f HIV/AIDS,
and boosting the currently l o w utilization o f health services. L o n g distances, poor infrastructure,
and the lack of ambulances limit access to health services in remote areas. Mobile clinics have
helped alleviate this concern, but these clinics provide limited services o n a rotating schedule.
CAS activities w i l l aim to expand and improve public health interventions, particularly
immunizations and skilled birth attendance, to enhance district planning and monitoring and
evaluation o f performance, and to strengthen capacity and human resource development in the
sector. The CAS w i l l support analysis o f health financing options and o f the potential role for
communities in the management and financing o f health services. Bank support w i l l be delivered
through the TFET/EC-financed Second Health Sector Rehabilitation and Development Project
(HSRDP 11) and an EC-financed and Bank/EC-managed program for implementation o f the
health SIP.

61.

I n the power sector, the CAS w i l l work to enhance cost eflectiveness in urban centers in
order to free up resources for expansion to rural areas, thereby enabling the development of
private sector activities across the country. M u c h progress has been achieved in ensuring the
availability o f reliable power services in the capital and in the collection o f electricity fees
through the installation of pre-paid meters. T o support private sector development, there i s an
In the context o f the 2003 Primary School Achievement Survey (PSAS), third-graders answered 28 percent o f
questions correctly, on average. Since there were four possible answers to each question, this score i s only
marginally better than what students would have achieved i f they had guessed throughout the test. See Timor-Leste
Education Since Independence: From Reconstruction to Sustainable Development for more on the PSAS.

urgent need to extend the availability of power to the districts and to lower the cost of electricity
nationwide. The Bank w i l l continue i t s assistance to the power sector through the TFET-financed

Power Sector Priority Investments Project, which aims to improve electricity generation,
distribution, and end-use efficiency in Dili as well as targeted initiatives to extend power
distribution in high-priority areas outside the capital. The Bank w i l l also implement the TFETfinanced Gas Seep Harvesting Project (Box 8) and develop the ESDP to enhance the availability
and reliability of power services in the districts and strengthen capacity for effective service
delivery. The ESDP w i l l serve as the required co-financing for GEF and CDCF grants, for which
Timor-Leste w i l l become eligible if i t ratifies the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). I f the Government were to opt for concessionary borrowing, such financing
would most likely be applied to high-return programs in the power sector.
I n other areas of basic infrastructure, the CAS will support the development of transport
and water supply services, particularly in rural areas. Infrastructure development i s crucial to

62.

enabling economic growth, private sector development, and the delivery o f priority services such
as education and health. Though the road network i s extensive, i t i s in poor condition and subject
to frequent closures during the rainy season. The rehabilitation and maintenance o f roads i s not
yet guided by a strategic plan that addresses priority needs and maximizes the effectiveness o f
scarce resources. According to the SIP on Water Supply and Sanitation, about half the population
o f Timor-Leste lacks access to a safe water supply, with lower access in rural areas. The CAS
w i l l focus on rehabilitation and maintenance o f roads and bridges to improve connectivity and
reduce the high transport costs that currently inhibit private sector development and service
delivery. In the area o f water supply, the CAS w i l l help strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework, corporatize the WSS, and build capacity to improve the efficiency and coverage of
services. The Bank’s support to transport and water services w i l l rely on collaboration with the
ADB, AusAID, and JICA, who take the lead in these sectors.
Box 8: Harnessing the Power o f Gas Seeps
Along the rugged southern coast o f Timor-Leste, there are several areas where natural gas i s seeping through
the earth and escaping into the atmosphere. Several o f these gas seeps have been burning for decades, while those
that are not yet burning are releasing harmful greenhouse gases. For every cubic foot per second o f gas produced,
these natural seeps could produce 250 kW o f power generation for about 25 years. Harvesting the emissions from
the nearly 30 gas seeps could therefore support electricity generation in major population centers in the southern part
o f the country, notably Viqueque and Los Palos. A t the same time, gas seep harvesting w i l l provide considerable
environmental benefits b y reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming. I f Timor-Leste
were to ratify the UNFCCC, these activities could potentially earn the country carbon credits, brokered through the
Bank’s Carbon Fund Unit. Proceeds o f carbon credits are normally paid on delivery, typically over a ten-year
period. However, a portion may be payable up front, enabling the purchase o f power generation and transmission
facilities (or transport o f compressed natural gas) in district centers and rural communities.
A demonstration gas seep harvesting project and an associated power plant are a key feature o f the power sector and
natural resources and environment SIPS. The Government has therefore requested that TFET funds be used to
finance the Aliambata Gas Seep Harvesting project, located in the Aliambata sub-district o f Viqueque and
administered b y IDA. The project has subsequently been accepted by the Bank as a candidate for carbon financing.
Based on this acceptance, Japan Special Financing for climate change activities was obtained to assist in preparation
of the project. Preparation activities underway include: (a) conducting a technical study to sample and test the
Aliambata gas seep and subject to satisfactory results design permanent gas seep harvesting facilities; (b) carrying
out a technical study on the potential for use o f gas to provide power to district and sub-district centers either
through transmission o f power from a central generation plant, or transport of compressed natural gas to distributed
power plants; and (c) community consultation activities to inform decision making in these areas.

B a n k Assistance Strategy: Creating Conditions for
Sustainable G r o w t h and Poverty Reduction

37

I n support of social development and integration, the CAS w i l l support efforts to
recognize arrned and civilian veterans of the resistance. There has been significant progress
toward the creation o f a Veterans Law, and the CAS w i l l continue to assist in the participatory

63.

development o f policies and legislation on the recognition o f veterans. The CAS w i l l also
support the completion o f the veterans database, transfer o f the database to the National Veterans
Directorate, and specific recognition measures. The Bank’s support to Timor-Leste’s veterans
w i l l draw upon the CSP and grant financing from IDF and the Post-Conflict Fund (PCF).

64.
To support the above outcomes, AAA w i l l target issues in each key sector. An ongoing
Health Sector Review focuses on: (a) the determinants o f health outcomes; (b) options to
improve the sustainability o f Government programs and tap capacities in the non-Government
sector; and (c) definition o f priority actions to reduce the burden o f disease. A study on Making
Services W o r k for the Poor, based around the results o f the upcoming Poverty Assessment, w i l l
explore scenarios for reaching the poor in education, health, water supply, electricity, and other
basic rural services, including through public-private partnerships. The CAS w i l l support an
analysis o f the implications o f rapid population growth for service delivery and job creation. A
specific study w i l l canvass the challenges facing youth and offer possible solutions, with
particular attention to the growing problem o f youth unemployment. The Bank w i l l continue to
finance the development and implementation o f a youth policy through an ongoing PCF grant.
W o r k in the energy sector w i l l be reinforced b y a study on household fuel and technical
assistance for the development of a power regulatory framework.
Pillar 2: Creating Productive Employment

65.

The creation of productive employment is fundamental to CAS efforts in support of
sustainable growth and poverty reduction. In a context of rapid population growth, relatively l o w

education coverage, and a large number o f youth entering the workforce, the creation o f jobs w i l l
be critical to reducing poverty and maintaining stability. Significant action i s needed to enhance
the business enabling environment, to expand credit, to improve business s k i l l s , to transfer
technology for producing marketable goods, and to build the associated marketing chains.
Together with access to electricity and roads, this i s key to the development o f the private sector
and the creation o f jobs. In the short term, jobs w i l l need to be created through the
implementation o f capital works programs-both Government and donor financed-and
the
related promotion o f the local construction industry, and through an emigrant workers program.
The CAS w i l l support the creation o f productive employment through targeted efforts in private
sector development and agriculture, working toward the following outcomes:

The CAS will support direct j o b creation in two targeted ways. First, a program o f
overseas employment has been initiated and i s expected to create 3,000 new jobs for Timorese
workers over the CAS period. Second, the effective and prompt execution o f the Government’s
rapidly growing budget, with an increased focus on labor-intensive programs, w i l l contribute to
the creation o f several thousand low-skilled jobs annually. The implementation o f construction
activities supported under various Bank projects in sectors such as education and health, w i l l also
help to alleviate the severe unemployment problem. The PFMCBP w i l l provide assistance in
designing and implementing labor-intensive public works programs like the Government’s
community roads maintenance program, allowing for an increasing budgetary allocation towards
such programs. Through an IDF grant, the CAS w i l l help to identify bottlenecks in the execution
o f the capital development budget, and the PFMCBP w i l l assist in addressing these constraints.
Pending the effectiveness of these measures, the implementation o f CFET capital development
programs w i l l be helped b y harnessing the capacity of local and international staff currently
deployed in TFET programs. The impact o f all these activities on j o b creation w i l l be monitored
through the CSP. A new IDF grant w i l l be devoted to building capacity for the regular
completion o f a light labor survey.

To promote private sector development, the CAS will support measures to create an
enabling environment for business development and private investment. Remaining gaps and
uncertainties in the legal and regulatory framework governing the private sector are an important
67.

reason for the slow rates o f domestic and foreign private investment. Added to this are the
difficulties experienced b y entrepreneurs in dealing with an inexperienced bureaucracy. Reports
o f corruption are becoming more frequent. The CAS w i l l support improvements to the business
registration process and the enactment and implementation o f laws on investment, leasing, credit,
and collateral along with the necessary implementation regulations and strengthening o f
supporting institutions. The CAS activities w i l l support training programs for c i v i l servants as
well as awareness and capacity-building programs for existing and prospective entrepreneurs
through the Business Development Centers and private educational institutions, with a special
emphasis on women and youth. Assistance w i l l also focus on the creation o f a structured
Business-Government dialogue, through which publidprivate working groups w i l l tackle key
constraints in the business environment. The Investment and Export Promotion Agency w i l l be
supported with the intention o f promoting foreign direct investment and j o b creation. K e y areas,
such as eco-tourism, niche markets for non-traditional products, and agribusiness w i l l be
targeted. Bank support to private sector development w i l l continue under the TFET-financed
Second Small Enterprise Project (SEP 11).
To stimulate local investment, the CAS w i l l work to improve access to credit and security
of land and property rights. Insufficient availability o f credit and a lack o f clarity in land and

68.

property rights, especially for smaller businesses in rural areas, and for women and youth, are
key constraints to j o b creation. The CAS w i l l support the development o f a credit and collateral
registry, training and support programs for microfinance institutions, and expansion o f existing
commercial banks to rural areas. Ownership rights w i l l be strengthened and a functioning market
developed in land through approval of necessary laws and the creation o f a land titling system.
Through the CSP, the Bank w i l l support Government efforts to develop credit and ownership
rights.

B a n k Assistance Strategy: Creating Conditions for

69.

The International Finance Corporation is expected to launch operations in Timor-Leste
during the CAS period. The I F C proposes to establish and implement a five-year technical

assistance program in Timor-Leste through the Pacific Enterprise Development Facility (PEDF),
which w i l l seek the approval o f i t s donors to expand into Timor-Leste. The program’s objective
w i l l be to build upon work undertaken b y TFET to improve the business environment for small
and medium enterprises (SMEs), focusing on access to finance, tourism, agribusiness, and
entrepreneurship development. PEDF w i l l collaborate with the Bank to address issues identified
in the Doing Business report and w i l l refer possible investment opportunities to IFC. All
programs w i l l be designed to: (a) facilitate investments in the priority sectors; (b) complement
and work in partnership with existing donor programs; (c) tackle obstacles in the business
environment; (d) integrate considerations o f sustainability, including environment, gender, and
governance; and (e) identify clear metrics for effective monitoring and evaluation, including
outputs, outcomes, and impact. PEDF w i l l locate staff in the Dili office o f the World Bank. The
Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), a joint IFC-World Bank initiative, w i l l also
complement work undertaken in these areas.

70.

I n the agriculture sector, the CAS will support a series of measures to ensure sustainable
resource management and improve food security, recognizing their importance for enhancing
the availability of productive employment. Impediments include macro-economic factors such as

monetary and trade policy, wages, and prices; lack of a policy or legal framework or necessary
information base to facilitate development; inadequate technology; and insufficient skills. The
C A S w i l l support the development o f a legal and regulatory framework for forestry and fisheries,
including the identification o f protected areas, as well as the development and implementation o f
a fisheries licensing system with a rigorous system o f monitoring and control. Needed
improvements in food security have been constrained b y a lack o f information on production
techniques and insufficient access to high-quality inputs and credit. The C A S w i l l assist TimorLeste in developing a food security strategy, establishing a system for testing and distributing
traditional and non-traditional crops and production technologies, and enhancing agricultural
extension services, with particular emphasis on women. The CAS w i l l also contribute to the
establishment o f a functional system for the collection o f statistics in agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries, in collaboration with the University o f Timor-Leste and the Food and Agriculture
Organization. A key priority w i l l be to strengthen the capacity o f the Ministry o f Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) to act as an effective service provider, despite the challenge
posed b y the small number o f staff in the ministry. The Bank’s main activities w i l l be carried out
through the TFET and EC-funded Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Program (ARP III)and
possibly a new EC-funded agriculture program. I f Timor-Leste becomes eligible for GEF and
B C F activities through the ratification o f the UNFCCC and the UN Convention on Biological
Diversity, there i s great potential for the Bank and other development partners to assist with
nature conservation, biodiversity preservation, and prevention o f land and watershed
degradation.

7 1.

The agriculture sector also provides the greatest potential for domestic private
investment and j o b creation. Through the CSP and ARP 111, the Bank w i l l work in a coordinated
way to help the Government enhance the business orientation o f the sector through the

identification o f potential markets, development o f high-value and niche products, and
establishment of mechanisms for coordination and information sharing between MAFF and the
Investment and Export Promotion Agency.

72.

To support the above outcomes, targeted AAA w i l l provide critical insights into the
creation of productive employment. Ongoing work, including a labor market study and a Private
and Financial Sector Review, w i l l be completed. The upcoming flagship study on labor mobility
in the Pacific w i l l include Timor-Leste as a focus country. Beginning in 2005, an annual update
o f Doing Business in Timor-Leste w i l l be produced. The Bank may also provide technical
assistance in creating an enabling environment for business development, in coordination with
development partners such as the ADB and USAID. Given that rural growth w i l l be the key to
overall economic growth, the CAS w i l l support the development o f a Rural Growth Strategy
encompassing rural infrastructure (power, roads, water) and agricultural development, with
special attention to rural youth aspirations, rural-urban migration patterns, environmental impact,
and opportunities for micro-enterprise development.
Pillar 3: Strengthening Governance

73.

Strengthening governance is a critical objective over the CAS period, as the nation's new
institutions are consolidated and the oversight arrangements foreseen in the Constitution
established. The Government has expressed i t s commitment to develop institutions o f good
governance and build integrity in the State, and appreciates there i s only a short window o f
opportunity to prevent corruption from taking root. Building on progress made in nation building
and institutional development, there i s a need to strengthen the checks and balances envisioned
in the Constitution and to tackle emerging corruption. While recognizing that building good
governance requires a long-term approach, the CAS w i l l support activities both within and
beyond the Executive, with a view to achieving the following outcomes:

74.
I n promoting good governance, the CAS w i l l support the development of safeguards
against corruption and abuse of power, and work to increase awareness of citizen rights.
Ensuring integrity w i l l require building the capacity o f countervailing State institutions and c i v i l
society organizations to demand good governance. The C A S w i l l work to strengthen the capacity
of the Parliament, oversight institutions, and the media, which are weak in comparison to the
Executive. The CAS w i l l support efforts to train Parliamentarians in the principles and
techniques o f budget analysis and monitoring and to strengthen independent audit arrangements.
The CAS w i l l assist in making the Office o f the Provedor operational. The CAS w i l l support the
development and adoption o f a Leadership Code in each branch o f the State as a means to build

'' Outcomes marked with an asterisk (*) represent areas in which the Bank w i l l focus i t s interventions.

integrity in the system. Such codes for high officials who are not public servants, would cover
responsibilities o f office and l i s t acts o f misconduct. They may include guidelines with respect
to conflict o f interest and the disclosure o f such interests. T o support these activities the CAS
w i l l draw upon grant financing from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), the AusAIDfinanced Pacific Facility, and the EITI t r u s t fund.

75.
A principal focus of the CAS will be the prudent and transparent management of
petroleum revenues to help ensure the sustainable wealth of current and future generations. The
C A S w i l l make use o f grant financing from the EITI trust fund to support mechanisms for
regular audits o f company payments and petroleum fund receipts, for the publication and
dissemination o f information on the petroleum fund in an accessible format, and for stakeholder
workshops. The CAS w i l l also bring assistance to the Consultative Council to the Parliament and
Investment Advisory Board to the MPF foreseen in the draft Petroleum Fund Act. The sector w i l l
be supported through the TFET-funded Second Petroleum Technical Assistance Project and the
PFMCBP.
76.
I n the justice sector, the CAS will work to improve access, quality, efficiency, and gender
awareness. Access to justice remains limited. Though progress has been made in reducing illegal
detentions b y the police and in reviewing court and prosecution backlogs, case management i s
inadequate and access to justice remains slow and inconsistent. L o w institutional and individual
capacity i s a critical factor across the system, and there i s a need to improve gender sensitivity in
the application o f justice. Through the CSP and in collaboration with UN agencies and bilateral
development partners, the CAS w i l l support efforts to establish the Superior Council for the
Prosecution, to ensure that the Superior Council for the Judiciary i s fully staffed, to reduce
prosecution backlogs, to improve gender awareness in the justice system, and to formalize
traditional mediation mechanisms where appropriate. The CAS w i l l also work to improve
community and gender awareness in the National Police and to strengthen the independent
investigation o f complaints against the police to foster good conduct and t r u s t among the
population.'*
77.
Within the civil service, the CAS will support measures to enhance the motivation,
responsibility, probity, and service delivery focus of staff and managers. Good systems w i l l need
to be supplemented with mechanisms to ensure integrity in leadership and discipline in the public
service. Through the CSP, the CAS w i l l support efforts to introduce a career development and
pay structure, build awareness o f how to handle conflicts o f interest when they arise, and
gradually introduce the declaration o f income and assets for senior officials in high-risk areas, in
order to demonstrate that high-level staff are not benefiting improperly from office. Drawing
upon an existing IDF grant, the CAS w i l l provide assistance to the Office o f the Inspector
General in conducting inspections and investigations and publicizing reports.
78.
I n support of institution building, the CAS will assist in strengthening the policy and
legislative development process. As a new country, creating new laws and policies forms a
considerable part o f the Government's work program. Greater prioritization and clarity in the
I D A provides support to and monitors only those activities in the joint CAS that are within its mandate; activities
related to the strengthening o f the national police force and associated judicial activities are supported and
monitored by bilateral partners, principally through the CSP.

Bank Assistance Strategy: Creating Conditions for
Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction

42

timetable for legislative processing, along with public consultation on key laws, w i l l be critical.
Through the CSP, the CAS w i l l assist in creating and implementing a clear process for policy
and legislative development, availability o f draft laws, and mechanisms for public consultation
on key pieces o f legislation. The delivery o f training manuals and workshops w i l l also be
supported.

79.

To promote results orientation, the CAS will work toward improved monitoring and
evaluation. The Government continues to make progress in establishing basic structures and
processes for the monitoring and evaluation o f public sector activities, but there i s room for
improvement in assigning explicit responsibilities and accountability for monitoring and
evaluation, providing targeted training in data collection and analysis, and enhancing
coordination across Government. The CAS w i l l assist in strengthening capacity for monitoring
and evaluation o f results, principally b y conducting a Participatory Poverty Assessment and
supporting the incorporation o f results into future poverty reduction strategies. Other activities
w i l l include providing support to the National Statistics Directorate on data collection and
analysis through an IDF grant, assistance in adopting the Ministry o f Health’s monitoring
approach in other ministries, improved monitoring o f budget outcomes, and efforts to ensure
inter-ministerial coordination and information sharing on monitoring and evaluation activities.

80.

I n the area of financial management, the CAS will support improvements to budget
implementation and revenue performance with a view to increasing access to high-quality
services, creating low-skilled jobs, and enhancing probity and transparency in the management
of public resources. The Government has made impressive progress in establishing good systems

for planning and budgeting, but heavy centralization o f decision-making authority has hampered
the execution o f the budget, which i s hindering service delivery and j o b creation. The CAS w i l l
support efforts to introduce careful delegation o f decision-making authority in expenditures and
procurement, accompanied b y appropriate measures for ex-post accountability. CAS activities
w i l l focus on strengthening the availability of budget information, both on the part of
Government in reporting to Parliament and providing information to district staff, and on the part
of donors in contributing data on indicative funding commitments. In the area o f revenue
management, the CAS w i l l work to ensure improved collections through streamlined customs
procedures and institutional capacity building in the East Timor Revenue Service and Timor Sea
Tax Division. Through the PFMCBP, the CAS w i l l support a broad program o f capacity building
in planning and financial management in MPF, line ministries, and districts (Box 9 ) aimed at
effective and prompt budget execution, including for labor-intensive programs and with specific
attention to the execution o f the capital development budget.

81.

To support the above outcomes, AAA on public expenditure management and building the
demand for good governance w i l l be undertaken. The AAA program includes a new Poverty
Assessment, and regular fiduciary assessments and public expenditure analysis focusing on
budget implementation. The C A S also includes analytic and advisory support to the media and
civil society organizations. These initiatives w i l l be carefully defined in complement to the
activities undertaken b y other donors.

Box 9: Building Capacity for Planning and Financial Management

A sound public financial management (PFM) system that harmonizes planning, budget elaboration, and budget
execution processes i s essential to supporting economic growth and effective service delivery while ensuring proper
accountability. Though the core expenditure management system in Timor-Leste compares favorably with that o f
other low-income countries on most criteria, capacity for P F M and understanding o f relevant systems and processes
remain weak, resulting in slow budget execution, with heavy costs to service delivery and job creation.
The Government o f Timor-Leste has therefore requested assistance from its development partners to jointly
elaborate a program o f capacity building in planning and financial management. The proposed PFMCBP aims to
strengthen the capacity o f staff in M P F and in financial management functions in line ministries and districts.
Program activities w i l l be designed around the capacity-building framework currently used b y the Capacity
Development Coordination Unit under the Office o f the Prime Minister for civil service-wide capacity building,
which i s structured around three interrelated pillars: systems and processes, attitudes and behaviors, and skills and
knowledge. The emphasis on systems and processes i s meant to ensure that institution building, as well as
transparent and efficient I T and procedural systems, are given adequate attention alongside the acquisition o f
individual skills and knowledge and the development o f attitudes and behaviors that are conducive to a culture o f
public service and integrity. Within these three pillars, the program will also seek to emphasize the following
principles: performance orientation, flexibility, sequencing, and Government ownership.
The program’s design w i l l reflect the Government’s overarching goals for the P F M system, as defined during
an inter-ministerial workshop in November 2004: (i)a strategic approach to planning and budgeting in support of
the country’s poverty-reduction strategy including creation o f low-skilled jobs; (ii) realism and sustainability of
plans and budgets; (iii)eflciency and effectiveness in providing value-for-money and supporting service delivery;
(iv) participation, through which relevant stakeholders are involved in decision-making; (v) transparency, both
internal within the Government and external to the public, with information available in readable and useable
formats; (vi) accountability, including strong systems for control, monitoring, reporting, and auditing; and (vii)
evidence-based decision making, where adequate information i s produced and used for expenditure policy and
management purposes.
The program w i l l support the continuation o f international staff, twinned with Timorese counterparts, in key
areas related to planning and financial management. Local and international training w i l l be provided to develop the
basic professional qualifications o f local staff, including management and leadership skills as well as technical skills
in accounting, macro-economics, budgeting, public finance, revenue management, and project management. The
program w i l l also include on-the-job training to build the capacity o f staff to perform their daily tasks.
I t i s proposed that the program, which i s expected to run for five years, be structured as annual programs
integrated within a medium-term framework. Each year, a plan o f capacity-building activities to meet priority needs
would be elaborated in a participatory manner for each M P F unit and for planning and finance functions o f line
ministries and districts. Agency-specific objectives would be supplemented b y cross-cutting areas requiring support.

Box 10: Principles of Engagement for the CAS
CAS implementation will be guided by four principles of engagement. Based on the lessons learned so far, the
following principles will be applied in the selection, design, and implementation o f activities: building institutional
capacity, deepening the results orientation, strengthening transparency and communication, and consolidating and
extending partnerships with donors. New operations will apply the four principles o f engagement, and if necessary,
ongoing operations will be restructured to reflect these key principles. CAS activities w i l l support the principles o f
engagement in the following ways:
Building Institutional Capacio
Aligning capacity-building interventions with human resource development plans anchored in sector
policies, strategies, and SIPS to ensure that activities respond to each sector’s long-term vision
Adapting institutional capacity-building initiatives to the varying level o f maturity o f sectors
Adopting a holistic approach to capacity building, linking improvements in systems and processes, attitudes
and behaviors, and skills and knowledge
Supporting initiatives to develop management skills and strengthen leadership across the public service
Developing creative approaches to capacity building that maximize learning opportunities without
removing staff from public service, such as virtual learning combined with face time utilizing the Dili
Distance Learning Center
Training and mentoring international advisers to support them in enabling their counterparts to fulfill their
roles, with the aim o f gradually transferring full responsibility to national staff
Ensuring adequate incentives including pay structures
Deepening the Results Orientation
Focusing increasingly on sector-wide rather than project-specific monitoring, and with a focus on gender
and youth
Replicating the health sector approach to monitoring a small set o f outputs and outcomes as well as inputs
Linking monitoring to planning and budgeting
Strengthening capacity for data collection and monitoring at the district level to sharpen attention to
challenges facing service delivery in rural areas
Supporting the development o f creative partnerships between Government, donors, and other stakeholders
to achieve early results on the ground
Strengthening Transparency and Communication
Helping the Government to implement proactive two-way c o m y n i c a t i o n and information activities to
foster inclusiveness and improve awareness o f results
Supporting efforts to publish the budget and information on budget execution in a format that i s accessible
to the public, including in the districts
Conducting workshops for Parliament, NGOs, media, and youth on petroleum revenue management
arrangements and other pertinent topics
Continuing to sponsor interactions with the youth group that participated in CAS consultations to discuss
development issues in monthly meetings
Keeping studies short or providing accompanying summaries, translating written materials into Tetun, and
proactively disseminating through workshops
Consolidating and Extending Partnerships
Organizing joint donor missions, simultaneously if possible, for the CSP and PFMCBP to monitor progress
and engage in constructive dialogue with Government and other stakeholders on program priorities
Developing a working group on harmonization and adopting joint output frameworks and streamlined
implementation mechanisms for PFMCBP and EFA
Actively participating in the SWGs in the sectors o f Bank engagement

VI. RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
The implementation of both Timor-Leste’s NDP and the Bank’s assistance strategy is
subject to a number of risks. Given the whole-of-Government character o f the CAS, the risks
faced by the Government and the Bank are largely the same. They include (a) fragile

82.

Government implementation capacity; (b) increased public dissatisfaction with Government and
the associated emergence of c i v i l unrest and deterioration in security; (c) worsening o f
governance and an entrenchment o f corruption; (d) fragmentation of donor assistance.

83.

Government implementation capacity may not improve fast enough to curb the increase
in poverty. Non-petroleum growth, j o b creation, and poverty reduction depend critically on the

effective and efficient implementation o f Government’s rapidly growing budget with a focus on
service delivery in the districts. Since the Government i s keen to see public services delivered
predominantly b y State institutions, achieving this w i l l demand a drastic improvement in
implementation capacity. The CAS i s designed to mitigate this risk b y focusing squarely on
capacity building across Government for planning, budget execution, and monitoring for results.
Short-term measures w i l l include the deployment o f international staff and on-the-job training in
systems and processes. The CAS w i l l also target longer-term measures leading to enhanced
motivation and responsibility o f c i v i l servants, such as adequate incentives, training in
leadership, management, attitudes and behavior, and the streamlining o f systems and processes.
Special attention w i l l be given to the implementation of the capital development budget, which
has a direct impact on employment across the country, for example through budgeted
construction activities. Cross-agency capacity building w i l l be complemented b y institutional
capacity building in key sectors, targeted to the level o f maturity o f the sector. The CAS w i l l also
encourage the extension o f creative partnerships with NGOs, the private sector, and communities
to increase the pace o f implementation.

84.

The population may become increasingly dissatisfied with Government resulting in civil
unrest and a relapse into conflict. High unemployment, rapidly growing youth cohorts,

increasing corruption, inexperienced security services, and a lack o f popular empathy with the
challenges faced b y the Government all contribute to an environment in which violence may reemerge, even if this remains unlikely. The CAS w i l l seek to mitigate this risk b y focusing on j o b
creation, both through the effective implementation of Government’s growing capital
expenditures, and b y improving productivity and market orientation in the rural areas, supported
b y improvements in rural infrastructure. The CAS w i l l seek to understand and start addressing
the challenges posed b y the youth bulge. Through partnerships with other donors, institutional
capacity building for security services w i l l remain an area o f focus, as well as the adequate
recognition o f armed and civilian veterans o f the resistance. Finally, the CAS w i l l support the
Government in fostering a constructive dialogue with the public, to enhance mutual
understanding, manage expectations, and improve services.

85.
As petroleum revenue comes on stream, governance may worsen and corruption may
become endemic. Timor-Leste’s petroleum resources create huge governance risks, as can be
seen from the experience o f resource-rich countries across the globe. T o date, the Government

has consistently followed a policy o f transparency with regard to petroleum revenue
management, adoption of a state-of-the-art petroleum revenue savings policy and fiscal regime,
and anticipation of EITI principles. Overall, i t i s recognized that the Executive i s so far the

Risks and Mitigation Measures

46

strongest branch o f the State and that effective checks and balances are needed to create a fully
democratic, pluralistic, and accountable state. At the same time, the history o f 24 years o f
Indonesian occupation implies that few people can refer to experience with a successful model o f
governance. With elections anticipated in 2006 or 2007, this may be exacerbated b y populist
pressure to relax fiscal discipline. Timor-Leste i s committed to ensuring that the oversight and
accountability institutions laid down in the Constitution are put in place as fast as practically
possible, and to creating an efficient and disciplined administration. The CAS w i l l seek to
mitigate this risk b y helping to strengthen the emerging governance architecture, while working
to enhance the demand for good governance through improved transparency and enhanced
capacity in media and c i v i l society.
86.
Donor assistance may become fragmented, putting further strains on the Government’s
weak implementation capacity. As multi-donor arrangements such as TFET are giving way to
bilateral interventions, the benefits o f close coordination may be lost and the cost o f interacting
with donors may increase, causing Government to focus on compliance with donor procedures
rather than on strengthening i t s own systems. The CAS w i l l mitigate this risk b y helping the
Government to consolidate and deepen the current strong partnerships around an improved
combined sources budget. The whole-of-Government CSP w i l l continue to be the primary forum
for policy dialogue with the community of development partners. The CSP w i l l be twinned to the
cross-agency PFMCBP, supported b y a host o f donors. In addition, the CAS w i l l seek to support
close partnerships around the SIPS and the SWGs, pursuing synergies between donor programs
in the sectors. This may include jointly implemented sector programs or formal agreements to
support the same goals under an umbrella o f programs and deploy harmonized procedures.
Sectors o f emphasis for improved partnerships w i l l be health, education, agriculture, and energy.

Attachment A

- Budget Execution

1.
Though Timor-Leste performs very well in fiduciary accountability, this comes at a high
cost to service delivery as budget execution is very low. Core expenditure management systems
compare favorably with other low-income countries, meeting 12 of 15 public expenditure
management benchmarks established b y the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
(Table A.l). Yet the potential benefits of these strong systems are offset b y critical bottlenecks in
budget execution. Though commitment levels are reasonably high across all expenditure
categories, with total expenditures (cash plus commitments) averaging 93 percent in aggregate
terms in FY04, the picture i s significantly different for actual cash expenditures. In FY04, budget
execution reached only 75 percent on a cash basis, down from 95 percent in FY02. As of endMarch 2005, only 48 percent o f budget appropriations were spent on a cash basis. When
annualized, this figure corresponds to an estimated budget execution rate o f 64 percent on a cash
basis in FY05.

DifSiculties in budget execution are most pronounced for capital development spending.
Across all ministries, the execution o f capital development budgets has been problematic,
averaging around 10 percent on a cash basis in FY03 and F Y 0 4 (Table A.2). Based on
expenditures through March 2005, capital spending i s currently on track to reach only 8 percent
in FY05. This i s o f particular concern in key sectors where capital spending i s crucial, including
school construction and roads rehabilitation and maintenance. Capital development spending in
the Ministry o f Transport, Communications, and Public Works amounted to only 5 percent o f
appropriations on a cash basis in FY04, and in the same year, zero capital development spending
took place for the MECYS. Budget execution in the area o f minor capital has been slightly
better, though actual cash expenditures averaged only 29 percent o f appropriations in FY03 and
53 percent in FY04. M i n o r capital spending during the first three quarters o f FY05 projects an
average of 21 percent for the entire fiscal year.

There are important gaps in goods and services expenditure in key sectors. The execution
of goods and services expenditures i s variable across ministries, but average spending on a cash
basis has declined from 87 percent in FY03 to 77 percent in FY04 and, as of March 2005, was
projected to be only 61 percent in FY05 (Table A.3). Actual spending on goods and services was
particularly l o w in MECYS (29 percent) and the Ministry of Development and Environment (33
percent).

l3
Goods and services budget execution also appears low in the MPF (32 percent), owing to a large supplementary
allocation to cover reimbursement of overpaid taxes from contractors no longer active in the Timor Sea.
l4
The police budget makes up over 85 percent of the budget of the Ministry o f Interior. Though allocations for the
Ministry of Interior and the National Police (PNTL) were reported separately in the December 2004 Supplementary
Budget, monthly budget execution reports do not disaggregate them.

49

Attachment A

4.

Slow budget execution is due to heavy centralization of expenditure management, tight
expenditure and procurement controls, weak capacity in ministries, and poor communication
between the MPF and line ministries. Most line ministries and districts do not have the computer

systems necessary to monitor their budget execution rates. Further, there i s no effective
disbursement system to send funds to the districts, resulting in districts only holding small
imprest accounts rather than funds for supporting national programs or local service delivery.
Improving budget execution while maintaining accountability poses an essential challenge for
Government.

Attachment B Environment

1.
Timor-Leste occupies the eastem half of Timor island, the eastem-most of the Lesser
Sundas group. I t i s approximately 300 km long and 50 km wide, with a total land area o f 15,000
s q km. I t i s mountainous, with peaks up to 2,920 m, and bordered b y coral reefs. The climate i s
monsoonal, with distinct very rainy and dry periods, Rainfall i s relatively high (over 1750 mm
on 65 percent o f the island) and much o f i t falls in heavy storms.
2.

Seventy-five percent of Timor-Leste’s population lives in rural areas, where poverty is
most prevalent, and depend on natural resources to meet their basic needs. Eighty percent o f
employment i s natural resource-related, and 98 percent o f households use wood as their primary

fuel.

Land
The land rises steeply from the sea and is intersected by rock-strewn river valleys, many
of which are dry, except after rain storms. Narrow coastal plains border pristine beaches.
Seventy-six percent o f the land area i s covered by secondary (mostly scrub) forest and 10 percent
by grassland. Mangrove stands dot the coasts. The hill forests were once rich in sandalwood, but
these were virtually eradicated during the colonial era. Only 13 percent o f the land area i s

3.

suitable for agriculture. The main food crops are rice, maize, and cassava. Drought and poor soil
restrict yields. Food security i s already a problem and w i l l worsen with rapid population growth.
Coffee, vanilla, candlenut and coconuts are grown commercially in small quantities. Fertilizers
and pesticides are not widely used and pose little environmental threat.

4.
About one-third of the land area is partially to severely degraded due to a combination of
poor soil, deforestation, overgrazing (by goats), and slash-and-bum agriculture. M a n y hillsides

are relatively barren and are severely eroded b y periodic rainstorms. Flash-flooding causes large
volumes o f s i l t to be deposited in estuaries and on nearby reefs.

5.

Most inhabitants do not have secure land tenure, though a comprehensive program of
land legislation is under development. An umbrella Land L a w outlining the overall juridical
regime for land titling was promulgated. A Decree L a w was passed on the leasing of State
property, allowing leases of up to fifty years on Government lands in both urban and rural areas,
including agricultural properties. A draft law on land registration and titling i s currently under
consideration b y Government, and i t s passage i s expected b y the end of 2005. Once
promulgated, this law w i l l establish a comprehensive property system, including registration and
titling and rules b y which claims can be processed and resolved.

Water and Marine Resources

6.

I n urban areas, streams are polluted because: (a) many households do not have access to
proper sanitation; and (b) industrial waste-water processing and regulation are limited. Thanks

to the country’s dispersed population and limited industrial development, inland and coastal
water pollution i s not a major problem, although coffee processing plants cause localized river
pollution.

52

Attachment B

7.

Reports of excellent diving conditions suggest that in-shore marine environments and
resources are in good shape. In-shore fishing activity i s modest, but likely to expand as rapid
population growth increases food demand. There i s potential to expand currently modest-scale
dive-related ecotourism. The national off-shore fishing fleet i s small, but foreign fleets
presumably exploit off-shore marine resources.

8.
The power sector SIP recommends that, in the absence of significant discoveries of
onshore petroleum resources, hydropower should play a substantial role in power generation
development over the next 20 years. The environmental impacts o f such projects need to be
considered. However, because geological constraints seem to rule out large reservoirs, impacts
associated with inundation o f land w i l l generally be very limited, and since most streams only
flow on a seasonal basis, downstream impacts are unlikely to be serious. The only substantial
project that might be developed in the short term i s the Ira Lalaro project in Los Palos, where the
natural outflow from Lake Ira Lalaro i s diverted b y a l o w dam immediately before i t s
disappearance into a sinkhole. Thus there are no downstream impacts, and since the rise in water
level caused b y the dam i s within the natural range o f water levels, there are n o reservoir
inundation impacts. Therefore environmental impacts are likely to be low.

Oil and Gas
9.
Timor-Leste and its surrounding waters harbor considerable oil and gas reserves. Gas i s
seeping from the ground in considerable quantities in several areas along the south coast. The gas
either disperses or burns around the seep area but does not seem to pose a major environmental
threat. The Bayu Undan off-shore o i l and gas field began production in 2004, but poses little or
no environmental threat. Further off-shore o i l and gas development i s likely. I f and when
realized, ambitious plans to build an o i l pipeline to the south coast and to develop on-shore o i l
processing facilities w i l l require a major upgrade in environmental management capacity and
control systems.

Air Quality
10.
A year-round warm climate, low motorization, and minimal industrial development mean
that air quality is relatively good, even in urban areas. Given the use o f wood as the primary
household fuel, indoor air pollution may be a significant issue. Dust i s a minor problem as well.
Environmental Public Services
Only 50 percent of the population has access to safe drinking water and proper
sanitation. Solid waste collection and processing are limited, and solid waste litters residential
areas. Poor environmental services pose health risks, including deadly dengue fever.

11.

Biodiversity
12.
Timor-Leste has a combination of Australian and Asian $ora and fauna. There are about
224 species o f birds, 23 o f which are endemic to the Timor island group. Timor-Leste also has
rich marine life. Threatened or endangered species include several turtle species and estuarine
crocodiles. The UN administration designated (but did not demarcate) 15 protected areas without
any stakeholder consultation, and they are not effectively managed. The Government has not yet

53

Attachment B

ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity so i s not eligible for GEF biodiversity
conservation assistance. UNDP i s providing technical assistance on ratification o f this and other
global environment conventions.
Environmental Institutions

13.
Government responsibility for environmental issues i s divided. The Ministry o f
Development and Environment i s responsible for environmental planning, urban environmental
services, and ecology. The Ministry o f Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries i s responsible for
these aspects o f environmental management. Both face severe constraints in capacity and
resources.

14.
The ADB has provided modest environment capacity building assistance to the Ministry
o f Development and Environment in the areas of water resource management and environmental
assessment.

Attachment C Achievements under the 2000 Transition Support Strategy

1.
The World Bank has been actively involved in the reconstruction and development of the
economy of Timor-Leste since late 1999,playing a catalytic role in mobilizing and coordinating
international assistance to the country. During the transition to independence, the World Bank’s
involvement centered around i t s role as trustee and co-manager o f TFET, which was established
in December 1999 as a vehicle to provide grant assistance for reconstruction activities and
economic development. Since FY03, the Bank has played a key role in mobilizing budgetary
assistance for the post-independence period through the annual multi-donor TSP, which focuses
on strengthening governance, improving service delivery, and fostering j o b creation. Across both
programs, sector coordination has been buttressed b y joint donor missions. These two principal
initiatives have been complemented b y grant-financed activities in targeted areas o f immediate
and emerging concern, such as demobilization and registration o f veterans, and youth policy
development. Technical assistance has been reinforced b y a comprehensive program of
analytic a1 work.
2.

The Bank has assisted sector reconstruction and institutional development through
TFET. Under TFET, which i s administered jointly with the ADB, the W o r l d Bank has managed
projects in agriculture, community empowerment, education, health, petroleum sector
development, private sector development, public management, and recently the power sector. In
total, TFET provided about 45 percent of all capital investment spending between FYOO and
FY03 (exclusive o f peacekeeping, humanitarian, and associated recurrent expenditures). Total
funding for the World Bank-administered projects amounts to U S D 115 million, o f which 96
million was disbursed b y end-March 2005.

3.

TFET has contributed considerably to reconstruction and development in Timor-Leste,
though at a slower pace than originally anticipated and with uneven results across sector^.'^
TFET programs have built and rehabilitated schools, health centers, roads, local markets, and
community irrigation schemes, and provided loans to SMEs. Institutional achievements include
policy development in the agriculture, education, health, and petroleum sectors, as well as the
preparation o f district health plans, creation o f Business Development Centers, and capacity
building at the community level (Table B.1). The impact on institutional development initiatives
has been strongest where programs have focused simultaneously on emergency assistance and on
the early development o f locally owned policies and strategies, the associated institutional and
legal framework, and related human resource plans, with all development partners providing
coordinated support. The health sector provides an example o f success in implementing
comprehensive and coordinated donor support.

Attachment C

Since TFET began, thirteen projects have been completed and nine projects remain

active. At end-March 2005, about USD 30 million remained undisbursed, and several programs
w i l l continue through FY07. During 2003, the TFET portfolio experienced a period o f
heightened risk and slow disbursements. Several reasons were identified. First, high turnover
among project financial and procurement staff around independence temporarily affected the
quality o f fiduciary management. Second, on the Government’s request, project management and
implementation were progressively integrated into line ministry structures; though desirable, this
shift posed some transitional challenges. Finally, there were difficulties in striking an appropriate
balance between short-term physical reconstruction and medium-term development objectives.
With concerted efforts to address these difficulties, all projects are now rated satisfactory in
terms o f development objectives, implementation progress, and fiduciary quality. All projects,
whether in the pipeline or active, have been aligned with the NDP, SP, and SIPS. In addition,
where feasible, construction methods and procurement procedures have been adapted to enhance
local participation while maintaining quality.

5.

After the restoration of independence, the TSP became the backbone of a whole-of
Govemment strategic partnership with donors. Initially, the TSP was conceived as a multi-

donor, medium-term program o f bridging finance to allow the Government to implement a
modest development program in the lean years before substantial o i l and gas revenues came on
stream. The TSP provided about U S D 30 million annually in grant-financed budget support from
FY03 to FY05, during the post-independence period in which the Government’s own revenues
were expected not to be sufficient to finance i t s annual CFET budget o f about U S D 75 million.
6.
Coordinated by the Bank, the TSP is eo-financed by nine development partners. In
addition to the IDA contribution o f USD 14.1 million, development partners have provided U S D
76.2 in bilateral financing through IDA-administered trust funds. These bilateral partners include
Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, N e w Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. Portugal has provided parallel budgetary support financing amounting to U S D
9 million from FY03 to FY05.
7.
Several other organizations participated in the TSP as observers, contributing actively to
the design of the program and assessments of progress. Among development partners, observers
included Brazil, China, the European Commission, Japan, Malaysia, the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Education Fund (UNICEF),
and U N M I S E T (now UNOTIL). In addition, c i v i l society members were consulted in the
development and monitoring o f the TSP action matrix.

8.

The TSP acts essentially as a Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit, supporting the
Govemment’s NDP and funding the CFET budget as its principal instrument for
implementation. Each year, an action matrix i s distilled mainly from the AAPs o f individual
Government agencies, presenting a sub-set o f the highest priority actions in the areas of: (a) good
govemance, including oversight institutions, public sector and public expenditure management,
the justice sector, and security; (b) basic service delivery, particularly improvements in the

efficiency and effectiveness o f health and education services, and support to vulnerable groups
such as veterans; and (c) j o b creation, especially through private sector development, agriculture,
and improvements in basic infrastructure.

58

Attachment C

The Government has praised the TSP for its role in fostering ownership, capacity
building, coordination, and results orientation in a post-conflict environment. The program has

9.

supported a whole-of-Government, strategic annual plan while sector policies and strategies are
developed. At the same time, the TSP fosters ownership b y taking guidance from the NDP and
AAPs and channeling donor funds through the Government’s own systems and processes for
budget preparation and execution. The TSP builds capacity b y encouraging prioritization and
monitoring, and b y providing a forum for policy discussions. In bringing the majority o f
development partners together to prepare and monitor the action matrix, the TSP provides an
anchor for all donor-financed activities and thus strengthens donor coordination. The TSP’s
cross-sectoral approach allows coverage o f all critical issues, making effective use o f the
comparative advantage o f each development partner within an overarching framework, without
neglecting areas in which some partners are not active. In this way, the TSP can address critical
security issues that are outside the Bank’s mandate, for example. This approach also promotes
mainstreaming o f cross-sectoral issues such as promoting gender equality. Finally, the TSP
promotes results orientation through i t s use o f a time-bound matrix o f policy and institutional
measures, as well as outcomes. The Government has expressed i t s appreciation for the TSP’s
role in instilling discipline while internal disciplinary mechanisms are s t i l l weak.
10.
Implementation of the TSP has also brought to light the challenges of budget support.
The program’s broad scope and wide donor participation pose difficulties in balancing ambition
with realism, as there i s a tendency for the action matrix to expand to meet the priorities o f
various Government agencies and development partners. Strengthening the program’s results
orientation b y moving f r o m input targets to output and outcome indicators has been difficult,
particularly as statistical capacity remains weak in the country and baseline data are not readily
available. The experience o f TSP implementation has emphasized the importance o f broadening
participation to include more middle-level managers and members o f c i v i l society in the
elaboration and monitoring o f the action matrix. Finally, i t has proved challenging to balance
accountability through ex-ante controls, on the one hand, and efficient service delivery through
timely execution o f the budget, on the other. This points to the importance o f careful program
design when using Government systems in a l o w capacity environment with weak accountability
structures.

11.
During the transition, the Bank provided punctual assistance to demobilization and to the
systematic registration of veterans of the resistance. Through a PCF grant, the Bank joined with
USAID and Japan to fund the demobilization and reintegration o f the approximately 1,300
fighters who were active at the end of the occupation in 1999 and who were not integrated into
the regular army. In addition, the Bank worked with UNDP, USAID, and several other bilateral

donors to assist the process o f identifying and registering about 37,000 ex-combatants and
Falintil veterans who had been active in the armed struggle between 1975 and 1999. A similar
process of identification and registration for members o f the civilian resistance i s also being
supported b y a PCF grant. The subsequent development o f policy and legislation for recognition
and assistance programs i s supported b y an IDF grant to the National Veterans Directorate.
12.
The Bank has also tumed its attention to helping youth in Timor-Leste. With the support
of a PCF grant, the Bank i s working with The Asia Foundation, UNICEF, and other partners to
assist the Government in developing a youth policy. Program activities include a mapping o f the
norms, values, and rules o f various youth groups and an institutional assessment to understand

59

Attachment C

the capacity o f youth-related organizations and define possible avenues for youth contributions
to development in Timor-Leste. A retreat was held in October 2004 to consult with youth from
around the country. A social mapping o f youth and an institutional assessment o f youth
institutions are underway. These activities w i l l serve as inputs to the definition o f a national
youth policy. The M E C Y S has established an informal working group to discuss youth issues
and monitor progress on program activities.

A strong analytical program has helped guide development choices and evaluates
13.
progress. A Country Economic Memorandum on Policy Challenges for a New Nation informed
preparation o f the Government’s National Development Plan. A Poverty Assessment, Poverty in
a New Nation: Analysisfor Action, was presented in 2003 and used as an input to the design o f
sector programs. Based on the results o f the Primary School Achievement Survey, Education
Since Independence: From Reconstruction to Sustainable Improvement - and i t s summary
report, Timor-Leste Education: The Way Forward - provided an analytical backdrop for policy
and legislative development in the education sector. Improvements in public financial
management and the design o f the TSP were supported b y a Public Expenditure Management
and Accountability Note, delivered in M a y 2002, a Country Procurement Assessment Report,
delivered in M a y 2003, and a full Public Expenditure Review, delivered in June 2004.
Strengthening the Institutions of Governance in Timor-Leste was finalized in September 2004
after broad consultation with Government, Parliament, the President, justice sector institutions,
c i v i l society, and development partners, forming the foundation for a constructive dialogue over
key issues in the area o f governance. Similarly, an issues paper on the Sector Investment
Programs was produced in December 2004 to explore aid delivery mechanisms appropriate for
implementation of the SIPS.The results o f a Demographic and Health Survey financed b y TFET,
completed in December 2004, have shed light on emerging concerns in the health sector. Finally,
ongoing analytical work on labor and veterans issues continues to inform the Bank’s social
sector programs.
14.
Analytical work in Timor-Leste has achieved the greatest impact when careful attention
has been paid to enhancing ownership, access, and relevance. Close collaboration, discussion,
and dialogue with Government - and in a few cases, joint production o f reports - has maximized
country ownership over analytical results. Knowledge sharing has been most effective when
information i s presented in a form that i s accessible to a broad set of stakeholders, as when
reports are kept short or accompanied b y a short summary. I t has also been important to translate
studies into Portuguese for the Government and into Tetun and/or Bahasa Indonesia for the
public. In terms of influencing policy, analytical work acquires the greatest traction when timed
to coincide with an event ensuring a broad audience, such as a national congress or multi-donor
TSP missions, or when i t i s the subject of proactive workshop discussions. For example, the
Bank’s summary report on education, Timor-Leste Education: The Way Forward was released in
time for the Government’s National Education Congress, and thus served as a direct input to the
development o f a national education policy.
15,
The Dili Distance Learning Center has strengthened knowledge sharing in Timor-Leste,
but could be used more strategically. The D D L C i s the most actively used Global Development
Learning Network in the East Asia region, offering three to four learning programs per month
over videoconference, encompassing 13 sessions and 215 participants per month on average in
FY04. Focusing on training for public administration, the D D L C has established strong

60

Attachment C

credibility b y taking guidance from local needs, b y working in a highly consultative manner, and
b y carefully selecting participants for maximum impact. A v i d support from donors, particularly
Portugal and Australia, has generated a steady pipeline o f funded programs up to April 2006.
Building upon this early success, the D D L C could further improve i t s effectiveness b y tying the
content o f i t s programs more closely to the Government’s strategic priorities. The D D L C could
also seek higher impact through “relay” with other channels o f knowledge, including the media,
backed b y closer collaboration with the communications team in the Timor-Leste office.
Loolung to the future, the D D L C w i l l need to strive for sustainability through the development
and implementation o f a strategic business plan based on long-term relationships with partners in
financing and content development.

Taxes and duties. Are there any

100%

None

Remarks I Explanation
While continuing to emphasize borrower commitment
and ownership o f individual projects, the Bank would
retain the option o f financing up to 100percent o f
project costs. However, specific arrangements would be
determined for individual projects, taking into account
project-specific considerations, Timor-Leste’s own
financing for the sector concerned, and project
ownership. In practice, the Bank’s financing share in
many projects i s expected to be less than 100% given
that the Bank would co-finance these projects with
other develonment Dartners.
In the near term, recurrent cost financing i s expected to
be very small. In the event that Bank-financed
operations envisage significant recurrent cost financing,
these would be subject to detailed sustainability
analysis, which would inter alia, demonstrate the
sustainability o f project objectives, quantify any
implied future budgetary outlays, and demonstrate their
integration in future budgets as appropriate. Improved
combined sources budgeting that strengthens the
linkages between the National Development Plan, the
SIPS, the medium-term fiscal framework, and the
annual budget (which would improve overall coherence
and sustainability) would be monitored and taken into
consideration in determining recurrent cost financing.
The two requirements are met. The Bank can therefore
finance local costs in the proportions required in
individual projects,

The Bank may finance the costs o f taxes and duties
associated with project expenditures. No taxes or duties
are identified as unreasonable or discriminatory. At the
project level, the Bank would examine whether taxes
and duties constitute an excessively high share o f
project cost.

62

Attachment D

2.
Cost sharing. The Bank’s financing share in individual projects has traditionally been
close to 100 percent except in regard to withholding taxes and a small proportion o f local costs.
The Government now finances about 25 percent o f i t s development program, but this share i s
expected to increase to about 50 percent as i t s budget grows to the sustainable level within the
limits o f the petroleum revenue savings policy. Going forward, the Bank i s expected to finance
less than 5 percent o f Timor-Leste’s development expenditures. As discussed in paragraph 28,
the Government i s making efforts to bring a greater proportion o f donor financing into the
budget. The Government also continues to improve the quality o f information and reporting on
combined sources budgeting. As discussed earlier, the Government has a strong commitment to
and ownership o f i t s development program, and the implementation track record o f ongoing
projects i s satisfactory. While continuing to emphasize client commitment and ownership o f
individual projects, the Bank would retain the option o f financing up to 100 percent o f project
costs. Specific arrangements would be determined for individual projects taking into account
project-specific considerations, Timor-Leste’s own financing for the sector concerned, and
project ownership. In practice, the Bank’s financing share in many projects i s expected to be less
than 100 percent given that the Bank would co-finance these projects w i t h other development
partners (Table 5).
3.
Recurrent costfinancing. In the near term, recurrent cost financing i s expected to be very
small, covering mainly PMU-related expenditures. Going forward, there may be a need to
finance recurrent costs, for example in the social sectors. Even so, there are expected to be no
immediate implications for fiscal sustainability given current borrowing policies and the
Government’s conservative fiscal policy. No country-level limit o n Bank financing o f recurrent
costs i s proposed. In the event that Bank-financed operations envisage significant recurrent cost
financing, these would be subject to detailed sustainability analysis, which would inter alia,
demonstrate sustainability o f project objectives, quantify any implied future budgetary outlays,
and demonstrate their integration in future budgets as appropriate. Greater integration and
eventual absorption, if appropriate, o f PMUs into executing agencies, w i l l also reduce the
disconnect between these PMUs and the mainstream public service. Improved combined sources
budgeting that strengthens the linkages between the NDP, SP, SIPS, the medium-term fiscal
framework, and the annual budget should also improve overall coherence and mitigate against
sustainability concerns. Implementation of such measures would be monitored and taken into
account in determining recurrent cost financing.

4.
Local costfinancing. Locally procured goods have represented a very small share o f total
expenditures across most o f the portfolio, reflecting the nascent domestic private sector. Yet
there has been a trend toward decentralized implementation, with communities and local
companies being contracted to build schools, health posts, bridges, and other infrastructure. This
underscores the increasing importance o f local cost financing in the overall development
program. The financing o f foreign expenditures alone would not enable the Bank to assist in the
financing o f individual projects. In addition, though revenue i s expected to increase sharply to
about U S D 250 million per year for the next three years, under the Government’s petroleum
revenue savings policy, at most the sustainable portion or about USD 130-170 million would be
utilized. The balance w i l l be saved through the petroleum fund for future generations. The SIPs
suggest annual development financing needs o f about U S D 250 million over the period, leaving
a financing gap o f U S D 80-120 million. Thus the financing requirements for the country’s

63

Attachment D

development program are expected to exceed the public sector’s own resources. The two criteria
for Bank financing o f local costs are met.

5.
Taxes and duties. The present tax and duty regime i s not considered excessive.16 The
Bank may therefore finance taxes and duties associated with project expenditures. A t the project
level, the Bank w i l l examine whether taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f
project costs. Bank financing o f taxes and duties i s expected to have a positive effect on tax
administration b y helping to remove the need for exemptions and preferential treatment for
Bank-financed activities.

16

Major taxes and duties are as follows: (a) There are four income tax brackets: lo%, 15%, 20% and 30%; with a
minimum income tax at 1% of turnover; a wage income tax with three bands: lo%, 20% and 30 %; and withholding
taxes on income earned from designated sources including dividend, interest, royalty, and rent ranging from 2% to
20%; (b) Import duties are levied at a flat rate o f 6%; (c) Excise taxes are levied on designated goods, many o f
which do not appear in Bank-financed projects (e.g., beverages including alcohol, tobacco, arms and ammunition).
Ad-valorem rates for most items are under 20%, except for luxury goods including automobiles, yachts, and aircraft.
Tax rates for gasoline and diesel fuel are US$0.06 per liter; (d) The sales tax on imported goods i s 6%; and (e) The
service tax on designated services such as hotels, restaurants, telecommunications, and rentals i s a flat rate o f 12%.
