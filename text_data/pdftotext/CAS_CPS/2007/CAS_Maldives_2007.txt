EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
This World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) aligns a joint IDA/IFC
assistance program behind the Government of Maldives’ development strategy for the next five
years through FY12. The Bank Group’s overarching objective is to contribute to policy and
institutional reforms that help maintain the country’s successful development trajectory of the last two
decades.
ii.

The country context has changed considerably since the last CAS was discussed by the
Board in 2000. While the economy has continued to grow, the Maldives experienced very real
economic and social rupture in the wake of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, which
caused damage worth 60 percent of GDP. The GoM has also initiated a wide-ranging reform program
to modernize its governance in line with its middle-income status.1 Furthermore, demands upon
government for better services are rising rapidly with income levels.

iii.
While the context may have changed, the Maldives remains a strong performer. In 1978,
the Bank Group’s first year of engagement, it was one of the world’s twenty poorest countries with a
population of 156,000. In 2006, with a population of just under 300,000, it is on its way towards
achieving upper middle-income status with a per capita GDP of about US$2,800. Furthermore, this
economic upsurge has been achieved alongside progress in human development. The past decade has
seen increased literacy, reduced maternal and child mortality, declining poverty levels, and
improvements in access to basic services.
iv.
Nevertheless, at this time of change, the country faces three serious challenges: (a) the
sustainability of its fiscal policies, (b) the completion of ambitious governance reforms, and (c)
adaptation to global climate change. Sustaining the Maldives’ remarkable development progress
hinges on the government’s ability to address these key challenges in the short-term, and to prioritize
policies and programs that maintain the country’s successful development trajectory over the medium
to long-term.
v.
Applying the principle of selectivity and taking into account the changing country context
and challenges facing the Maldives, the proposed World Bank Group assistance program seeks to
further three strategic development outcomes: (a) a well-managed economy attracting increased
investment; (b) increased quality of education in support of a better skilled workforce; and (c)
improved capacity to manage the country’s pristine, but fragile, natural environment. These
strategic outcomes will be supported through IDA credits (mobile phone banking, education and
environmental management), strategic IFC investments and TA, and a flexible program of AAA. In
addition, two cross-cutting development themes have emerged as essential ingredients to the country’s
overall development program. These are: building stronger institutions and capacity to levels
commensurate with the socio-economic development of the Maldives; and encouraging population
and development consolidation (PDC) on larger islands.
vi.
The IFC is today a key partner of the Maldives and in this CAS is playing a strategic role as
part of a Bank Group strategy. During the last CAS period the IFC committed a total of US$47.8
1

On December 20, 2004, days before the tsunami struck, the UN General Assembly endorsed a recommendation
that the Maldives graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC) status at the end of 2007. Given the impact of
the disaster, the transition process was subsequently deferred and the Maldives will now formally graduate on 1
January 2011. The main implication for the Maldives is the loss of duty exemptions on tuna exports to Europe.
Graduation from IDA and IBRD eligibility are not linked to this process.

million (US$46.5 million in debt and the remainder in equity), consisting of four projects in the
financial, tourism, logistics and telecommunications sectors. In addition, the IFC has expanded its
South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (IFC-SEDF) with a dedicated advisory services program
to cover Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and has established a framework to provide support to Small and
Medium Sized Enterprise (SMEs) within an enhanced investment climate. The IFC is considering
further investments in the Maldives in the areas of infrastructure, access to finance and tourism.

vii.
The proposed program has built-in flexibility. Because the CAS period straddles the end of
the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP) and the first half of the next five-year government
strategy, the mid-term review of the CAS scheduled for FY10 will coincide with the start of the
government’s next strategy. This will be an opportunity to review CAS progress against the indicators
of the CAS Results Matrix as well as fine-tune the program in line with the government’s priorities in
the next plan. Pending fiscal adjustment, the strategy proposes a programmatic, policy-based
investment model for the second half of the CAS period. The eligibility for the Maldives for IBRD
funds will also be reviewed at that time.
viii. The CAS is designed to mitigate the risks that could reduce the effectiveness of the World
Bank Group’s operations and to further develop the ability to monitor the impact of interventions.
These include the immediate fiscal risks as well as the political risks due to the country’s upcoming
first multi-party elections. To mitigate these risks, the Bank Group will maintain close dialogue with
the authorities and with other donor partners in Male’. In addition, the Bank Group is in close dialogue
with the authorities and staff of the IMF with regard to the country’s fiscal situation which has
worsened significantly in recent years. Flexibility has been built into the proposed program to adjust
the mix and level of Bank instruments in response to emerging fiscal and political risks. Finally, given
shallow capacity in many of the implementing agencies, there are some implementation risks. Hence
operations will be designed simply and in close coordination with the government. Where possible,
government M&E systems will be upgraded as part of the Bank Group’s interventions so as to avoid
the expense of developing project-specific monitoring systems.
Issues for Board Discussion

ix.
Given the short-term country risks and challenges, is the proposed assistance strategy
appropriate?
x.
Does the Board endorse the need for the World Bank Group to maintain some flexibility with
respect to the content of its assistance program?

I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

1.

The Maldives has made impressive development gains over the last three decades. In 1978,
the World Bank Group’s first year of engagement, it was one of the world’s twenty poorest countries
with a population of 156,000. Today, with a population of just over 300,000, it is on its way towards
achieving middle-income status with a per capita GDP approaching $2,800. Furthermore, economic
upsurge has been achieved without compromising human development. On the contrary, the past
decade has seen increased literacy, reduced maternal and child mortality, declining poverty levels, and
improvements in access to basic services.

2.
The sustained growth and rising prosperity of the last three decades was founded on sound
fiscal policies, political stability and a highly successful tourist industry, based upon the country’s
extraordinary natural assets. The Maldives is endowed with 1,192 small tropical islands that cross
strategic shipping routes and has a marine environment rich in diversity. The coral reefs are the
seventh largest in the world and cover an area of 8,920 square kilometers. There are now 89 tourist
resorts in operation, up from 64 in 1990 and with another 45-50 planned; over the last ten years tourist
arrivals have increased at an average annual rate of 8 percent. Fish catch, the other main economic
activity, has increased around 5 percent per year during the same period. The revenues achieved
through these core economic activities are ploughed effectively into infrastructure and human
development investments.
3.
Nevertheless, like other small states, the Maldives faces high unit costs of infrastructure
and other public service provision. Sovereignty imposes high indivisible fixed costs on small island
economies including policy formulation, regulatory activities, education, social services, justice,
security, and foreign affairs. The Maldives’ economic base is narrow, and diversification is limited by
the small size of the domestic market and distance to markets. The economy is therefore vulnerable to
exogenous shocks in international markets as well as to natural disasters. Openness and international
investment has brought development to the Maldives, but it also brings new challenges such as
increased environmental susceptibilities, and rising concerns with respect to youth unemployment,
security and crime.
4.
The context has changed considerably since the last CAS was discussed by the Board in
2000. During this period the Maldives experienced economic and social rupture in the wake of the
Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 which caused damage worth 62 percent of GDP. The
government also initiated a wide-ranging reform program that is still ongoing, to modernize its
governance institutions in line with its middle income status.2 Demands on the government for better
services are also rising with income levels.
5.
This CAS comes at a time when the country faces new issues that could offset— or
potentially roll back— some of the important development gains to date. Three key challenges are (a)
the sustainability of fiscal policy; (b) the passage of ambitious governance reforms; and (c) adaptation
to global climate change. In different ways, these challenges relate to the tsunami. The tsunami was a
major natural disaster with national, large-scale impacts. Furthermore, the tsunami complicated and
pressurized ongoing political reforms, ushered in successive expansionary budgets, and underlined
institutional gaps in the country’s response systems.

2

Formally, within the UN system, the Maldives will lose its Least Developed Country status only in 2011 although its per
capita GDP is already high enough for it to be classified as a middle income country, and is approaching upper-middle
income status.

A.

POLITICAL CONTEXT

6.
The current Head of State, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, has dominated politics in
the Maldives since 1978, presiding over a period of sustained economic growth and stability. In late
2003, President Gayoom embarked on wide-ranging reforms to the country’s political and institutional
framework. In March 2006 the government unveiled the “Roadmap for the Reform Agenda” which,
among other things, envisaged the revision of the Constitution ahead of the country’s first multi-party
elections planned for June 2008.
7.

Constitutional reform has proved difficult and slow. Despite extensive meetings of the
special Majlis to prepare the new Constitution, progress has been slow and pressures are growing to
ensure that the expectations for competitive and pluralistic politics are met. In August 2007, a
referendum was held on the country’s political system. Billed as a referendum on the president’s own
performance (in light of his announced intention to run again, for the last time, in the 2008 presidential
elections), the vote resulted in strong support for the presidential, rather than parliamentary system.

8.
An ambitious program of constitutional change is currently making its way through the
Special Majlis. In the political sphere, this includes a wider choice for electing a president; a limit on
the number of times one person may be elected to the office of president; removing the gender bar on
standing for the presidency; greater decentralization of executive authority by separating the functions
of the head of state from those of the head of government, including the creation of the office of prime
minister; abolition of the category of appointed members to the Majlis (the parliament); proportionate
representation in the Majlis; independence of the Majlis from the executive, with the speaker and the
deputy speaker becoming elected positions.
9.
The reforms reflect rising expectations amongst a polity that has new economic power.
Expectations of government among the people of the Maldives remain high. These span the range of
public services, including health and education, as well as addressing felt needs for protected harbors
and adequate fish processing capacity. There continue to be protests on the atolls related to the posttsunami reconstruction efforts which have neither moved quickly nor met community expectations.
The government faces the difficult task of managing expectations, and meeting core needs, while
returning to a sound macroeconomic and fiscal path.
B.

RECENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

10.

The Maldivian economy has performed strongly over the last 25 years, with real GDP
growth averaging over 7 percent a year. Following the tsunami, the economy contracted by 4.5
percent, but rebounded by 19.1 percent in 2006, and has remained strong in 2007. Rapid growth in the
last two years stems from the recovery in tourism and the high fish catch, boosted by accelerating

tsunami reconstruction activity and the development of new resorts.

11.

The tsunami highlighted vulnerability, but also resilience. The tsunami hit during the peak
tourist season, closing 21 of the country’s 87 resorts and totally destroying six. It displaced 29,000
people from their homes and caused damage equivalent to 62 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, by mid
2005 many of the closed resorts had re-opened and tourist flows were on their way to pre-tsunami
levels, reflecting the attractive tourism product and the strengthening of the euro against the rufiyaa. In
addition, the fish catch in 2005 reached record levels and off-set some of the weakening in other
sectors.

12.
The mainstay of the economy – the tourism sector – has continued to perform well. Tourist
arrivals so far in 2007 have exceeded the levels reached before the tsunami, and the government
expects arrivals growth of around 6-9 percent this year, as the sector looks to increase capacity in line
with rising demand. Leases for 11 new resorts were awarded in 2004, and a further 35 were awarded
in 2006. Although there have been delays in bringing the new resorts online (mainly due to
implementation and financing constraints), strong investor interest attests to the bright prospects of the
sector.
13.
At the same time, the tsunami ushered in a period of expansionary budgets. The fiscal
deficit, which was at 10.9 percent of GDP in 2005 and narrowed to 7.3 percent in 2006, was budgeted
to widen to 28.3 percent in 2007. While partial year data suggest that the outturns for 2007 are likely
to be much less expansionary than budgeted, this is largely the result of implementation capacity
constraints, rather than a reflection of explicit policy. A key challenge for the government over the
next 1-2 years is to constrain spending from the high levels that followed the 2004 tsunami and
coincided with gathering political reforms, in order to ensure that the impressive socioeconomic gains
of the past two decades are not undermined. This will be especially difficult in 2008, when the first
multi-party elections are planned. Much of the initial spike in expenditures in 2005 was driven by the
tsunami, but subsequent elevated spending has been mainly unrelated to the tsunami. In addition,
most of the tsunami-related spending has been externally financed. Hence, rising domestic financing
needs since 2005 are mostly unrelated to the tsunami, as well as being a key source of macroeconomic
risk.
14.
The current account deficit widened to US$369 million in 2006, equivalent to 41 percent of
GDP, and is expected to widen further in 2007. This is largely the result of the decline in the trade
account, where strong receipts from tourism are outweighed by faster increases in merchandise
imports. With the rufiyaa tied to the weakening US dollar, the exchange rate has depreciated
substantially over the past two years in relation to the main European and East Asian tourist markets,
helping maintain competitiveness. Import demand is fueled by the building of resorts and other
construction activities. The deficit is being financed by large private capital inflows, as well as official
creditors. As a result, reserves have remained resilient at US$248 million at the end of September
2007, covering around three months of imports of goods and non-factor services.
Debt Sustainability

15.

Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that debt service burdens are manageable if new
borrowing slows, but points to elevated vulnerability.3 Total external debt rose to US$592 million in
2006, including US$362 million in public debt and US$230 million in borrowing by commercial
3

The DSA undertaken by the IMF as part of the Article IV consultations concluded in mid-2007 is attached as Annex VI. A
more detailed joint IMF-World Bank DSA is planned in the first half of 2008, when more information on the fiscal outturns
for 2007, as well as the budget for 2008, will be available.

-4-

banks. This raises public external debt to the equivalent of over 34 percent of GDP, which is expected
to rise further to about 45 percent by the end of 2007. Domestic borrowing adds about 18 percent of
GDP, and debt service is absorbing an increasing, though as yet manageable, share of the budget. The
public sector external debt service ratio has doubled in recent years, increasing from around 5 percent
to over 10 percent of domestic exports of goods and non-factor services. Commercial banks have
borrowed heavily to finance resort construction, and official creditors have also made substantial
disbursements, especially the European Investment Bank financing for the reconstruction of tsunami
damaged resorts. Debt sustainability analyses suggest that the debt burden is manageable if new
borrowing moderates. The current fiscal path points to a continued increase in public sector
borrowing, however, raising risks and increasing vulnerability to external shocks and fiscal slippages.4
Poverty Assessment and Human Development Trends

16.
Poverty in the Maldives fell by more than half from 1997 to 2004. Based on a poverty line of
Rf.15 (US$1.17) per person per day, the headcount index of poverty (the share of the population
consuming below the poverty line) declined from about 45 percent to less than 19 percent before the
tsunami (see Figure 2). Poverty fell most in Male’: from 23 percent to less than 5 percent, and less
sharply, but still significantly, in the atolls: from 52 percent to 25 percent. As a result, even more than
before, income poverty is now concentrated in the atolls. The northern region appears to have seen
only a modest decrease in poverty and has now emerged as Maldives’ poorest region, followed by the
north-central region.5

Poverty has continued to fall following the tsunami – but sections of the population are still
vulnerable. According to the government’s impact assessment6 the tsunami had limited impact on
social indicators such as poverty, health and education. While the people of the Maldives suffered
serious loss of property and income as a result of the disaster, generous assistance from foreign and
domestic sources, along with good economic performance, has helped lessen its effects on the
economy in the short term and on average poverty decreased. Income levels only declined in Male (30
percent) and for islanders relocated to other islands (2 percent). Indeed, between June 2004 and June
4

Debt indicators are approaching the indicative thresholds for classification as moderate or high risk of debt distress, which
would affect the terms and volumes of IDA’s assistance, as long as the Maldives remains IDA only.

Vulnerability and Poverty Assessments (VPA) were undertaken in 1997, 2004 (pre-tsunami) and 2005 (post-tsunami). All
were prepared by consultants for the Ministry of Planning and National Development, the second was partially supported by
the World Bank. The third in the series is known as the Tsunami Impact Assessment Study (TIAS)

2005, the proportion of the island population with income less that Rf.15 per day fell from over 30
percent to around 20 percent. Nevertheless, the same analysis reveals that of the 21 percent living in
poverty in the atolls in 2005, only 7 percent has been consistently poor, while the rest are newly poor.

Maldives has lower poverty but high inequality relative to South Asia. Unlike other countries
in the region, Maldives experienced a spectacular growth performance and was therefore able to
reduce poverty despite increasing inequality. Nonetheless, high inequality in the atolls remains a
source of concern.
19.

Finally, with two exceptions, Maldives has achieved all of its MDG target indicators. The
gender gap in school enrollment and literacy among those aged 15 years to 24 years is virtually non
existent.7 The proportion of births not attended by skilled health personnel has been reduced by threequarters.8 The two exceptions are for gender equality and management of the environment. Given the
nation’s social, economic and cultural traditions, women are at a disadvantage to men, even if as a
group they are more equal than in other countries in the region. Current efforts to achieve the
environmental goal are inadequate and under-funded, as discussed in a later section of this strategy.
II.

KEY DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS

20.
The recently finalized 7NDP covers a broad range of the development needs and goals
through 2010. This section attempts to highlight a critical subset that targets the strategic challenges
facing the country over the short to medium-term, in particular: restoring macroeconomic and fiscal
balance, improving the investment climate, consolidating human and social development, building
institutional capacity, and sustaining the natural resource base.
A.

RESTORING MACROECONOMIC AND FISCAL BALANCE

21.

Overshadowing the strong economic performance is the substantial weakening of fiscal
policy over the past three years, which is the main policy lever for affecting outcomes in the
Maldives. This is the key source of risk facing the Maldives in the short-term. The fiscal outturns for
2006 showed an overall deficit exceeding 7 percent of GDP, mostly for non-tsunami related spending
(Table 2). Although the 2007 budget anticipated a deficit equivalent to 28 percent of GDP, driven by

7

-6-

substantially increased spending from the already high levels of 2006, the overall deficit is likely to be
less than half the budgeted level. Fiscal data for the 10 months through October 2007 suggest that
domestic revenue and expenditure are both below budget, resulting in a domestic deficit running at
about 2.6 percent of GDP. Much of the foreign loan financed investment also was not realized. The
less expansionary results so far in 2007 reflect implementation capacity constraints rather than a
strengthening of the fiscal policy stance, and the envisaged path of deficit financing over the mediumterm in the PRSP remains a concern for macroeconomic stability. The main challenge is to ensure that
highly expansionary fiscal policy does not undermine otherwise favorable growth prospects. It is
worth noting that the sustainability of elevated revenues depends in large part on a rapid schedule of
resort development that may be difficult to achieve. Spending needs to be kept within a realistic
resource envelope, lest deficits pose major challenges for the country, with repercussions for inflation,
private investment, growth, and external vulnerabilities.

While expenditures as a share of GDP were comparable to other small island economies in
previous years, they have reached very high levels since 2005, and appear to have risen still further
in 2007 (despite being below budget). A period of some increase is to be expected following a natural
disaster, but expenditure trends in the Maldives have become far out of line with the experience of
other similar countries, with allocations unrelated to the tsunami, as noted above.

Recurrent costs are also rising. While much of the growth in expenditures is projected to
come from elevated capital spending, line ministries may be facing greater capacity constraints
implementing the capital part of their budgets. With budget allocations increasingly dictated by
implementation capacity, rather than strategic direction, allocative efficiency appears to be weakening,
potentially introducing structural shifts in spending that will be felt for some time. For example, the
civil service expanded by about 9 percent in 2006 (Figure 3), which, given the general difficulty
associated with civil service retrenchment, may be having a ratcheting effect that will be felt over the
medium-term. Combined with promotions and an announced pay increase to be implemented starting

-7-

January 1, 2008, a growing share of the budget is likely to be absorbed by pay and allowances,
straining public finances.

There is a continuing need to limit recourse to domestic financing. Although the fiscal
outturns for the first ten months of 2007 suggest that the domestic budget will be close to balance for
the year as a whole, this follows two years, 2005 and 2006, when domestic financing amounted to 11.5
percent of GDP, and the 7NDP points to substantial further recourse to domestic financing over the
plan period to 2010. In order to mitigate vulnerability and reduce risk, the Bank and other partners
have encouraged the GoM to pursue explicitly strengthened fiscal policy, link its development
programs with more realistic estimates of available financial resources, and restore the usefulness of
the budget as a tool for setting strategic fiscal policy.

25.
The IMF Article IV consultations, concluded in April 2007, presented two medium-term
scenarios:9


Base case: spending remains high with continued large overall fiscal deficits crowding out the
private sector, lowering growth over the medium-term, increasing inflation, widening the current
account deficit, raising debt to almost 80 percent of GDP, and inducing a fall in reserves to about
1.5 months of imports of goods and non-factor services (a level that induced a devaluation of the
rufiyaa in 2001).



Alternative policy: spending is controlled, raising growth, containing inflationary pressures,
lowering external imbalances, and inducing a build in reserves to about three months of imports of
goods and non-factor services.

9

The medium-term scenarios of the IMF Article IV for overall balance including grants in 2007 is different than the budget
figures presented in Table 2 above, as the scenarios foresaw implementation capacity constraints limiting the envisaged
spending to below budget, while the alternative policy scenario reflects renewed fiscal restraint. Partial year data confirm
that spending is indeed running substantially below the levels envisaged in the budget, but the information available is
presently insufficient to revise the macroeconomic framework.

This exercise underlines the need for sound budgeting and explicit fiscal restraint over the
next few years, including through the planned democratic transition in 2008 and 2009, in order to
ensure sustainability and mitigate risks. Indeed, generating fiscal surpluses and limiting borrowing is
also an important mechanism for mitigating vulnerability to external shocks (including environmental
shocks). Addressing the short-term fiscal issues and restoring the role of the budget as one of the
strongest policy levers available to the government will be central to the government’s ability to
meeting the medium- to long-term development challenges faced by the Maldives.
Medium-term outlook

27.
Provided the GoM is able to strengthen its fiscal policy stance and adverse macroeconomic
possibilities are not realized, the medium-term outlook in the Maldives is favorable, underpinned by
the vibrant tourism sector and continued investment in human development. Improving economic
management and other arrangements that underpin growth hinge on renewed political will to constrain
expenditures. In addition, it will require strengthening institutions, and capacity, such as the recent
moves towards greater central bank independence or training activities in Public Expenditure
Management (PEM). Increasing value added in diverse activities will also depend on generating
economies of scale through greater connectivity and population consolidation. In addition to these
cross cutting strategies, ensuring an appropriate skills mix in the labor force and improving the
investment climate will be important to deepen links between tourism and the rest of the economy, and
increasing domestic value added in sectors such as fisheries. Finally, safeguarding the environment is
essential for the continued success of both the tourism and fisheries industries, as well as mitigating
risks associated with global warming and other natural disasters, such as tidal surges.
B.

IMPROVING THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE

28.
Achieving the government’s goal of diversifying the economy—and diversifying the
ownership of the economy—requires continued improvements to the investment climate. The World
Bank’s Doing Business surveys10 find that the Maldives is a relatively good place to start a business,
pay taxes and employ workers, but a difficult place to get credit, export goods, enforce contracts, and
close a business. The recently completed Investment Climate Assessment11 (ICA) highlights access to
10

-9-

finance, the cost of finance, access to land, and corruption as being the most important obstacles to
investment (Figure 4).

29.
Tourism and fishing will remain the mainstays of the economy but will exert increasingly
demanding standards for environmental management. The tourism industry draws directly on the
maintenance of a pristine environment, giving the resorts an incentive to maintain very high
environmental standards, as required by the government. As surrounding inhabited islands become
more populous and exert greater pressure on the environment, it will be necessary to strengthen
environmental practices (for example, ensuring more careful treatment of solid waste to keep the reefs
free from debris). Sustaining economic activity in higher value added fishery products will also
depend on sound environmental management practices, continuing with the sustainable tuna fishing
practices, while improving the capacity to monitor the extended economic zone (EEZ) and limit
overall yields to sustainable levels. Finally, careful management of the coastal environment also helps
mitigate the negative effects of periodic tidal surges and flooding.
30.
The Government is exploring other growth avenues such as transport and logistic centers.
The government is actively promoting the possibility of creating a container transshipment port in the
north of the county, adjacent to the major shipping lane between Europe and South and East Asia. In
order to broaden the ownership base which is currently concentrated narrowly on a small number of
families, the 7NDP emphasizes the need to encourage more SMEs, and with this same objective, has
recently created a publicly owned company—the Maldives Tourist Development Corporation—the
shares of which it is proposing to sell to small investors.
31.

Connectivity is improving. The provision of good international and internal transport services
is critical for the development of the Maldives. The country’s major port is in Male’ but this is nearing
capacity. There is currently a single international airport in Male’ which is beginning to show signs of
strain, and capacity enhancements are required. However, a second airport in the southern Addu atoll
has recently been opened, which will spur tourism in the south. Telecommunications in the Maldives
have improved dramatically in the last decade. Mobile phones are already ubiquitous with more than
260,000 mobile subscribers (compared to a total population of 300,000 plus 50,000 immigrant
workers). There is still a need to increase access to the internet, and broadband systems are rapidly
spreading out into the atolls.

32.
Encouraging linkages between the domestic SME sector and resorts is critical. Helping to
facilitate the financing of SMEs, as well as addressing other constraints of the vibrant SME sector will
also be important to deepening the links between the resorts and the local economy. At present tourist
firms source only about 30 percent of their material inputs and supplies from the domestic sector.
Manufacturing is slightly higher at 37 percent and logistics and transport is at 41 percent. There is
concern that outside Male’, few jobs are being created beyond the new resorts. The agglomeration of
economic activity in regional growth centers is crucial to move away from the quasi-subsistence
activities of artisanal fishing and farming, towards more productive activities connected with modern
service industries or tourism.
33.
Education and vocational training will contribute to preparing new school leavers. The
government must continue to use revenue generated in tourism to maintain large investments in
education and vocational training, in order to ensure that the labor force possesses an appropriate skills
mix to sustain robust development in a middle income economy. This is central to employment
generation, especially for growing cohorts of school leavers, expanding employment opportunities for
Maldivians in higher level positions in resorts, for example, and also playing an important role in
deepening the linkages between the resorts and the local economy.
C.

BUILDING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

The Maldives is currently undergoing a rapid—although largely peaceful—governance
34.
transition.12 As highlighted in the 7NDP, impressive socio-economic gains over the last three decades
have outpaced the development of accountable, transparent and effective governance institutions. The
program of reforms described above aim to correct this imbalance. In particular they are targeting
overhaul of the country’s oversight and justice sector institutions. However, in parallel the government
is seeking to strengthen the capacity, effectiveness and transparency of executive branch agencies.
These reforms will be the critical underpinning for sustained growth, macro-economic stability and
improved human development.

35.

The 2004 tsunami underlined the need to strengthen the country’s institutional base in line
with the needs of an increasingly sophisticated economy. The economic gains to date have been
facilitated by a far-sighted domestic elite that has relied on informal rules and cohesive networks to
implement a set of pragmatic private-sector oriented policies, while abiding to a measure of self
discipline in terms of sound macro-economic management, as well as consistency and stability in
policies. The sophistication and maturity of the Maldivian economy, however, depend increasingly on
establishing a more formal rule-based environment based on accountable and effective institutions. An
educated middle class has grown in size, become more globally integrated, and is demanding greater
accountability and transparency. The domestic private sector and foreign investors also require
transparent and efficient regulatory institutions that create a level playing field as well as a judicial
system that ensures the rule of law and the enforcement of contracts.

12
Two recent incidents have threatened this record. On September 29, 2007 a small homemade bomb was detonated in
Male’, injuring 12 tourists. This is the first instance of such violence since a coup attempt in the late 1980s. In early October
2007, 90 armed members of a radical congregation held a Maldives security service officer hostage inside a mosque in a
remote island for three days before a resolution was found. Government ministers had previously expressed concern about
radical religious/political influences in a country with a long tradition of religious moderation.

The Maldives outperforms the region and its income category peer group on most
governance indicators, but underperforms in the area of voice and accountability (see Figure 5).13
This is consistent with rising political and social tension: an increasingly vocal opposition has formed;
the ruling party faces internal splits (several important cabinet members left the party during 2007 to
establish alternative political bases); and there have been several large demonstrations, as Maldivians
seek effective channels of representation.
37.
Strengthening the capacity of the civil service will be critical if the country is to provide
public services at a level consistent with its upper-middle income aspirations. Despite a gradual
improvement in the education and skills of senior civil servants, the civil service still lacks policy,
implementation, and administrative capability. Over half of the civil service is concentrated in three
ministries: education, health and defense services. The remaining employees are spread over 18 other
ministries and 12 presidential authorities. There is a need to strengthen transparency, effective
performance management, career structure, and human resources in the system. Ad hoc allowances
have become increasingly significant, often amounting to as much as one half of total take home pay.
Average salaries are low relative to the private sector; although civil servants need work only a six
hour day, and secondary employment to supplement incomes is legal and common.
38.
Public expenditure management, public financial management and public financial
accountability are emerging as increasingly important issues where institutional arrangements and
capacity are significant constraints. The Majlis passed the Public Finance Act in 2005, establishing
‘the principles and procedures for control and management of the finances and property of the state.’
This is an important step but its implementation will face considerable challenges.14 The law is
proposing to make substantial changes to the public financial management architecture. It lays down
the framework for preparation of the annual state budget including its passage by the parliament,
consolidation of public moneys in a single public treasury account, and requires the government to
maintain proper accounts including preparation of annual financial statements. To complete the
accountability chain, the law also requires a timely audit (within five months of the end of the fiscal

year) from the auditor general and the tabling of the report in the parliament through the office of the
president.

39.
Initiatives to control corruption should be strongly supported. As in other small island
economies the risk of patronage, corruption or conflicts of interest is high. The Maldives scores better
than other South Asian countries on control of corruption indicators. However, corruption emerged
from the ICA as a significant obstacle to investment. The government has committed itself to several
promising initiatives. A new Public Accounting System (PAS) will be fully implemented over the
next three years. The Audit Act was passed in April 2007, which allows the Audit Office to act
independently with direct interactions with parliament. Until this point there was no legal framework
to ensure the independence of the auditor general and to allow for audit findings being made public.
Although the Audit Office is required to audit the government’s accounts, its staff capacity has, to
date, been limited, resulting in inadequate coverage. There is also a need to strengthen the Anti
Corruption Board, which was established in 1991 but has had limited resources at its disposal.
40.
Reform of the government’s public procurement system is necessary. Currently the system
lacks a legal framework as there are no consolidated national public procurement instructions,
resulting in the various agencies adopting ad-hoc approaches to this function. Government is aware of
the need for these reforms and is giving their introduction priority, including the provision of capacity
development to enable institutions and its civil servants to understand and properly apply such
instructions. The system also lacks an effective independent procurement grievance mechanism, which
can act as an oversight function to proper implementation of procurement rules and, hence, a deterrent
to corruption practices.
41.

In general, the direction of governance reforms is positive, yet the scope and pace are
ambitious for a small country. New institutions such as an independent Supreme Court and Judicial
Services Commission are being created that will require staffing and financing. Reforms of such a
fundamental nature require due deliberation and adequate country wide public consultations before
they are enacted into law. Yet the timetable established is extremely tight, driven as it is by a June
2008 deadline. A heavy responsibility will fall on the first set of elected officials in 2008. Much will
also depend on how effectively the media and civil society use their newly won freedoms to enhance
public voice and accountability, while at the same time not provoking a backlash from interest groups
who may lose out from political liberalization.

D.

CONSOLIDATING HUMAN AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

The Maldives is seeking to consolidate human development gains while also responding to
42.
new challenges. Rapid economic growth and broad access to basic services have enabled the Maldives
to rapidly reduce poverty, improve health care and education standards, and meet most of the MDGs.
At this stage in its development path, the country is consolidating these gains and seeking to increase
the quality of its service provision to a standard commensurate with the country’s income levels. In
addition, the country faces new challenges such as vulnerability, malnutrition, fertility, and youth
unemployment which represent significant implications for other aspects of social and human
development, including education and economic productivity.

43.
Common to all sectors in the Maldives is the additional challenge of scale. Supporting the
government’s population consolidation policy and developing capacity in the government agencies are
two essential cross-cutting areas for all donors in the country.

Education

44.
Maldives needs a population with good quality education, including higher education, to
provide the managerial and technical skills necessary to sustain economic growth and to be globally
competitive. The school system is not producing enough quality people and the private sector is
heavily reliant on foreign workers for all types of work. The public education and health systems are
also heavily staffed by foreign workers outside of Greater Male’. The challenge for Maldives is to
provide quality education, particularly higher secondary and tertiary, in a cost-effective manner.
45.

Access to education has risen but quality remains uneven. Maldives has successfully
addressed the basic challenges of school access particularly at the primary level. However, while
literacy is almost total, the quality of education is uneven and learning achievements are mixed. Only a
small proportion of the children leave school with a qualification, and “O level” pass rates are low
even for the minority who enter for the examination.

46.
Achieving quality improvements will inevitably increase costs. Both rising expectations and
the recent declines in fertility (meaning that smaller numbers will need to be enrolled at the lower level
but more at the higher levels) will put pressure on costs. The government may not be able to offer
quality education without consolidating the population. Today, primary school education (Grades 1 to
7) is universal, lower secondary schools (up to grade 10) are located on 138 islands and it is the
government’s intention to make 10 years of education available to all before 2010. But the cost of
doing these on 138 islands is prohibitive and the government is seeking ways to tackle the issue, with
help from the World Bank Group through the Integrated Human Development Project (IHDP).
47.
Access to higher secondary schools (Grades 11 and 12) is more limited and schools are
located on a much smaller number of islands: 14 in July 2007. An even smaller proportion of young
people have access to tertiary education. Whereas for primary and lower secondary schools there is not
gender bias in admissions, for upper secondary and tertiary education there is a bias in favor of boys.
This is thought to be due to the social pressures not to leave home to continue their studies. Increasing
access to upper secondary schools will be much easier when a larger proportion of the population live
on a small number of larger islands.
Health Care

48.

In one generation, the public health landscape of Maldives has transitioned from that of a
poor country to that of a typical middle income country. The health MDGs were reached communicable diseases were brought under control, and infant mortality fell to just 12 per thousand
births, a decline of two-thirds from 1990 to 2005. Longevity grew, and a Maldivian born today can
expect to live to age 72, a gain of 24 years since 1978. These results have been made possible by a
major expansion in public investment and an influx of expatriate doctors – both of which have
increased access to healthcare. This expansion continues: the total number of atoll hospitals, health
centers and health posts has more than doubled since 2001. As with other basic services, it will not be

- 14 -

possible to provide a consistent level of quality care on all islands in a fiscally sustainable manner
without some population consolidation.

49.
While infectious diseases are generally under control new diseases including dengue,
influenza, scrub typhus, and thalassaemia, have recently emerged as significant problems. Up to
one in six Maldivians are said to be carriers of thalassaemia, which gives the country one of the
highest incidences in the world.15 Looking ahead, the biggest long-run challenge to the Maldives
health system is the rise of degenerative non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease
and cancer which will place a great burden on the health system and on both public and private
finances. The health system needs to address this by developing treatment protocols and operating
procedures which can address these new challenges in a cost-effective manner. The World Bank’s
IHDP and WHO are working with the government to develop these systems.
Social Protection

50.

Vulnerability is outpacing the country’s ability to provide safety nets. Two particularly
vulnerable groups are women and unemployed youth. Women are at risk because their rights are not
fully protected by law or society. This issue is also highlighted in the 7NDP. While their position in
society may be stronger than in most other South Asian countries, as a group, women still do not have
the same rights as men. Worryingly, a recent survey undertaken by the government recorded high rates
of gender based violence and sexual molestation. Drug abuse is a growing problem, particularly
among young men. Reported cases of drug abuse have more than trebled, from around 200 every year
in the late 1990s to 600-700 in 2004-05. Most drug users are young: 95 percent are 16-39 years, and
53 percent are age 16-24.

51.
Safety net programs are ad hoc and overlapping. The government would like to develop an
effective social protection system for its country that is consistent with its level of income and
implementation capacity. Economic growth has been, and will continue to be, the dominant factor in
the reduction of poverty in Maldives, but the concentration of poverty in the Northern atolls and
among particular population groups is of considerable concern. Seeking to address these issues, the
government is interested in reforming its pension system, and meeting the constitutional mandate to
provide income support to the elderly. It is also interested in developing an effective safety net for the
very poor, and those who may suffer poverty from catastrophic health shocks or from natural disasters.
The government’s priority is to establish a pension plan first for government employees, but to extend
it quickly to the private sector, as the first step in developing a financially sustainable social security
and safety net system. The Bank Group has supported this effort through analytical work and is
considering an investment in the future.16
E.

SUSTAINING THE COUNTRY’S NATURAL RESOURCE BASE

The country’s considerable environmental assets have been and will remain the key source
52.
of growth for the economy.17 Nature based tourism remains the country’s primary industry accounting
for almost 70 percent of GDP, with fish and fish processing contributing to about 10 percent of GDP.
Recognizing the economic significance of its fragile environment, sustainability has remained an
important development priority in the Maldives. Indeed, the Maldives stands as a rare success story of

- 15 -

a resource rich country that has judiciously managed its natural capital to fuel prosperity and graduate
to middle income status. But much of this is changing with rising population densities and growing
aspirations.

53.
Economic prosperity has been accompanied by a litany of pressures on the natural resource
base that could jeopardize economic prospects. Between the resort and inhabited islands, there is a
marked difference in both the quality of the environment and the interest shown in protecting it. With
high population densities and affluence, the inhabited islands confront growing problems of solid
waste management, sewage disposal and other effluents emanating from settlements, fish processing
plants and other sources. There is inadequate treatment of waste water on most inhabited islands,
including the capital Male’. Simultaneously, the amount of waste generated (estimated at about 400
tons a day) far exceeds the processing capacity of available land fills. Sewage and solid waste can foul
pristine beaches, degrade sea water and damage the corals that are a magnet for tourists. This calls for
a considerable improvement in environmental management with policy principles being translated into
observable outcomes and an environmental infrastructure that matches the country’s needs.
54.
Over the long-term, climate change will be the most perilous environmental risk facing the
country. Geography has rendered the Maldives especially vulnerable to climate change. Being land
scarce, low lying (over 80 percent of the country is less than 1 meter above sea level) and affected by
storm surges arising from cyclones from the Indian Ocean, it is exposed to the risks of intensifying
weather events including damage caused by inundation, wind and flooding from storms. With the
melting of polar ice caps, the country faces additional risk of sea level rise. With future sea level
projected to rise within the range of 10 centimeters (cm) to 1 meter (m) by the year 2100, without
investments to adapt, much of the country could be submerged in the worst-case scenario.18 Tourist
resorts on low lying coral islands or located over lagoons are among the most vulnerable to sea level
rise. The loss of these assets would have a devastating impact on economic prospects.
55.
Degradation of the reefs has increased vulnerability to climate change risks. Ever increasing
damage to the reefs has impaired their protective functions and increased exposure to risks from storm
and cyclones. One of the major stresses to reef ecology is sea surface warming, resulting in coral
bleaching. Bleaching events have been recorded seven times since 1997, with the impacts being most
severe in areas that are stressed by pollutants, or damaged by physical disturbance. In addition, coastal
erosion poses another perennial problem for the Maldives. In their natural state the islands are highly
dynamic and continually changing shape. However, there is little experience on how to manage these
changes and there have been no systematic assessment of the economic consequences of erosion and
cost effective remedies.19
56.
Adapting to climate change will call for multiple approaches, guided by scientific risk
management. It would require costly investments in protective barriers such as sea-walls and land
reclamation, integrating climate risks in the planning, design and location of new assets and more
aggressive stewardship of the natural protective barriers formed by coral reefs. Considerable strategic
planning is necessary, to determine both the risks facing the various atolls and appropriate responses to
these long term risks.

18

As an example, in Hulehule an hourly sea level of 70 cm is currently a once in 100-year event. Under “moderate” climate
change scenarios it could become a once in 10-year event. However, scientists are still discussing the impact of global
climate change on the Maldives with some arguing against the theory that the Maldives faces inevitable and major flooding
in the near future. See N.A Mörner et al: “New Perspectives for the Future of the Maldives”, Global & Planetary Change
2004 (177-182).
19
An expensive sea wall has been built around Male’ but it is unlikely that this is an affordable solution for all islands, or a
desirable solution for resorts. The issue is also closely linked to population consolidation.

- 16 -

57.
Population consolidation and the creation of safer islands are part of the solution to climate
change, as discussed in the 7NDP. The need for such a policy is widely promoted and accepted
within the government, and was supported during discussions with the Bank by three out of the five
registered political parties. There is a consensus that, in the long-term and as the sea level rises, it will
be impossible to protect widely dispersed populations. In addition, the provision of increasingly
sophisticated social services is becoming prohibitively expensive on a large number of islands with
small populations. Population consolidation therefore produces benefits from lower costs of service
delivery, as well as being part of a strategy for adaptation to climate change. The location of these safe
islands needs to be based on detailed scientific assessments of climate risks. In the absence of
scientific data, current decisions do not appear to have been guided by risk assessments.
58.
The capacity to manage growing environmental pressures does not match the needs of a
vulnerable, resource dependent economy that is transiting to middle income status. There is
insufficient technical, financial and human capacity to either deliver the required environmental
infrastructure or monitor and control environmental impacts.20 There is also inadequate baseline
information on the status of habitats and limited experience in scientific management methods, despite
the importance of marine assets in fueling economic growth. Monitoring and enforcement of the
myriad environmental regulations is uneven, particularly in remote islands where financial resources
are limited. All of this suggests an urgent need to strengthen the information base of environmental
management and the mechanism for implementing and enforcing environmental policies to assure
sustained growth and prosperity. It is in this context that environmental sustainability has been
identified as a key pillar of the Bank’s assistance to Maldives.
III.

THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT PLAN

59.
The government has set out its vision and strategy in the 7NDP for the period 2006-2010:
“Creating New Opportunities”. This is also the strategic policy framework for achieving the
objectives of Vision 2020. The national vision is to achieve upper-middle income status, ensure more
equitable access to services and opportunities through urbanization and improved service delivery,
facilitate economic diversification, promote gender equality, and support better environmental
practices to sustain growth and adapt to global climate change.
60.
The 7NDP was compiled through a consultative process involving the government, NGOs,
and various private sector organizations and individuals. The broad objectives and key development
opportunities and challenges outlined in the 7NDP are presented in Box 1. In short, the eight key
principles underpinning the 7NDP are: (1) national ownership, (2) enhanced trust and confidence, (3)
economic opportunity for all, (4) gender equality, (5) environmental sustainability, (6) human rights,
(7) civil society participation, and (8) results focus. The 7NDP elaborates specific goals with
performance targets across four key areas: economic, spatial, social and governance.

20
As an example the Ministry of Energy, Environment and Water receive between 60-70 Environmental Impact Assessment
reports each year, that need to be reviewed and cleared within a month. But with only four graduates in the Ministry, there is
little capacity to evaluate and assess the reports in the desired depth and detail.

- 17 -

Box 1: The Government’s 7NDP
• The 7NDP sets out the development agenda for the Maldives for the five year timeframe 2006-2010. The
strategy was based on a national consultation process involving government ministries, Atoll and island
communities and the private sector.
• There are eight key principles underpinning the strategy: (1) national ownership, (2) enhanced trust and
confidence, (3) economic opportunity for all, (4) gender equality, (5) environmental sustainability, (6) human
rights, (7) civil society participation and (8) results focus.
The document presents a frank assessment of the country’s opportunities and challenges:
Opportunities
Challenges
¾ Unique natural capital
¾ Devastation of the tsunami
¾ Strategic location
¾ Environmental vulnerability
¾ Robust growth and macro-stability
¾ Small island economies
¾ Young population
¾ Over-reliance on tourism
¾ Quality capital & infrastructure
¾ Dependency on imported fuel
¾ Cohesive society
¾ Income & access inequalities
¾ Female & youth vulnerability
¾ Stronger institutions for democratic governance
¾ Drugs
¾ Weak financial markets
¾ Weak legal framework for development
¾ Erosion of moral values
•
As with the Sixth NDP, the 7NDP lays out the strategies to achieve the Vision 2020, elaborated by the
President in July 1999. According to Vision 2020, the Maldives will achieve upper-middle income status
within the two decades of the vision period. Other broad outcome indicators include more equitable access to
services and opportunities through urbanization and improved service delivery; economic diversification,
gender equality and better environmental practices to sustain growth and adapt to global climate change.
•
In order to achieve these broad goals the 7NDP elaborates specific goals with performance targets across
four key areas: economic, spatial, social and governance.

61.

Prioritization of the budgeting process will be key. In order to achieve the broad goals
outlined in the 7NDP, it will be important for the government to prioritize and link specific initiatives
to the budget. The 7NDP, for example, contains many policies, each with their own strategies. For
example, the section on construction has eight policies and 34 strategies. Implementing these
strategies will be a major task for the relevant institutions – as will monitoring the results. Still, the
overall framework underpins the government's commitment to sustaining robust development in the
Maldives.

62.
The CAS Results Matrix (Annex I) is closely linked to the goals, policies and indicators
used in the 7NDP. The staff of the Bank Group and IMF are submitting a Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) to the Board in concurrence with this CAS. While broadly supporting the strategies noted in
the 7NDP, including the emphasis on helping the poor and vulnerable, and fostering ‘population and
development consolidation’ for greater economies of scale, the JSAN re-emphasizes the need for
strengthened fiscal policy and a sound macroeconomic framework, without which many of the hardwon development gains are at risk. Effective implementation will also hinge on prioritizing institution
and capacity building efforts in the areas of public expenditure and environmental management, as
well as deepening the dialogue on population and development consolidation.

A.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

PAST IDA SUPPORT – ACTIVITIES AND LESSONS LEARNED

63.

Much has changed in the seven years of the CAS period, and the World Bank Group has
had to be flexible. The World Bank’s last CAS was approved in November 2000 and was originally
intended to cover the period up to the end of 2004. However, following the tsunami of December
2004, the Bank agreed to extend its agreed assistance program, to include emergency reconstruction
activities, and to delay the preparation of a new assistance strategy until 2007. The overarching goal of
the CAS was “the reduction of poverty and regional disparities in access to social and infrastructure
services.” To advance this objective, the strategy, in partnership with other donors, aimed to support:
(i) sustainable economic growth; (ii) improvements in public sector management, including
institutional capacity; and (iii) human development.

64.
The Bank Group’s financial contribution was modest compared to the size of the Maldives’
economy, amounting to less than 3 percent of government expenditures. During the CAS period the
Board has approved two IDA credits with total commitments of US$29.6 million and four IFC
transactions totaling US$47.8 million. These operations included the Third Education and Training
project, the Integrated Human Development Project, and the Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction
Project as well as IFC investments in the tourism, telecommunications and financial services sectors.
In addition, the Bank undertook a range of non-lending activities (a) to help the government manage
its public expenditures and develop medium term fiscal forecasts and plans; (b) to strengthen the
fiduciary management activities within the government, and (c) to help government develop land and
housing policies. Towards the end of the CAS period three additional and significant reports were
published, including an ICA and a study of the system of social security.21
65.
The country achieved impressive results during this time. With respect to the primary CAS
objective of poverty alleviation, the country’s performance has been very positive. Human
development outcomes have also been strong, but public sector management and reducing regional
disparities have been mixed. The outcomes achieved towards the specific targets of the 2000 CAS are
summarized in table 6 below.

- 19 -

66.
The following discussion attempts to unpack the impact of the Bank Group on these
outcomes:
67.

Sustainable economic growth. The Bank has helped strengthen the government’s capacity to
develop medium term fiscal forecasts and to manage the economy. Delivery of this work relied more
on regular contacts and dialogue than on formal sector work or the provision of consultant based
technical assistance. The IFC’s direct support for the creation of the now successful Maldives Leasing
Company has contributed significantly to the financial sector in the Maldives, as well as ongoing
technical assistance to the Bank of the Maldives (BoM) and the Housing Development Finance
Company (HDFC), in advance of its possible privatization. AAA activities around the business
environment, the fisheries sector and land registration have been welcomed by government and remain
influential.

68.
Public sector management. As noted above, the activities directly supported by the Bank were
limited to strengthening the government’s ability to manage public expenditures, its public accounts,
audit and its procurement functions. Progress in these areas has been slow and more work will need to
be done with additional commitment given to these important areas. The overall performance of many
government departments is generally not strong compared to countries of a similar income level.
69.
Human development was an area of major focus and outcomes were generally positive in this
sector and the Bank’s work can be more closely attributed to results. Access to social services has
increased significantly. The three most recent investment projects were all directly focused on the
development and refinement of social services, including most of the Bank funded activities within the
emergency reconstruction project.
70.
Portfolio performance. The design and execution of the three projects approved by the Board
between 2000 and 2005 was satisfactory. All projects were well received by the government with solid
ownership during both preparation and implementation. However, the quality of overall
implementation has been only marginally satisfactory. During implementation all projects have been
rated as unsatisfactory or marginally unsatisfactory for short periods. These ratings reflect the lack of
technical and policy making capacity in almost all ministries. While in most ministries the upper levels
are staffed by experienced and competent staff, competent mid-level staff with experience and
technical knowledge are lacking, as is the case in many small island economies.
71.
Lessons learned: Over the course of the CAS period the Bank Group’s assistance has become
more integrated, programmatic and responsive. Opening an office in Male’ has given the Bank Group
the ability to respond with flexibility to the government’s changing needs and circumstances. Given
the limited pool of capacity in the government, there is a premium on selectivity and on close client
consultation during project preparation. The objectives of the new strategy should be tightly focused
with a monitoring and evaluation framework that is both realistic and cost effective. Finally, donor
coordination is now more important for effectiveness in the Maldives, given the larger number of
donors that are working in the country since the tsunami. These lessons have been taken into account
during the preparation of this strategy.

- 20 -

B.

PRINCIPLES OF THE BANK GROUP’S NEW COUNTRY STRATEGY

An integrated World Bank Group program

72.

An integrated Bank Group program will be more effective in supporting the government’s
needs. This CAS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank and the IFC and as such it presents a
common view of development objectives in the Maldives, together with a commitment to a shared
strategy. Going forward, it will be critical to maintain close dialogue between the two institutions both
in Male’ and in Washington, given the synergies within the economic governance pillar of the joint
program between public financial management, transparency and an attractive business environment.

73.
The IFC has been very active in the Maldives since 2000. A total of US47.8 million was
committed (US46.5 million in debt and the remainder in equity). This consisted of in four projects in
the finance, tourism, logistics and telecommunications sectors. In addition, the IFC expanded its South
Asia Enterprise Development Facility (IFC-SEDF) with a dedicated advisory services program to
cover Sri Lanka and the Maldives and has established a framework to provide support to SMEs within
an enhanced investment climate. The IFC is also providing important support to strengthen the
operations of the Maldives Leasing Company, and the Housing Development Finance Corporation.
The IFC is considering further investments in the Maldives in the areas of infrastructure, access to
finance and tourism.
74.
The IMF has been actively engaged in the Maldives, fielding technical assistance missions
and staff visits in addition to the regular cycle of Article IV consultations. The teams of IMF and
other IFIs have been working closely with the World Bank’s macro and fiscal team. This collaboration
will continue to be of critical importance in the short run considering the risks posed by the
expansionary fiscal policy and also recognizing the limited leverage that the Bank Group may bring to
bear on its own on this matter.
A focus on coordinating activities with other donors

75.
Following the tsunami, the Bank Group developed stronger links with many other donors,
including through its office-sharing arrangement with the ADB. The World Bank representative’s
participation in the UN Country Team and donor coordination meetings has proved beneficial,
particularly in the period following the tsunami. The government has recently established the Maldives
Partnership Forum, with a view to developing stronger longer-term relationships between all active
donors and the government. These meetings were designed as a vehicle for exchanging information
and discussion and not as venues for providing pledges. It has met twice in 2006 and 2007. Partly as a
result of these interactions, this CAS is the product of close coordination with the UN system and the
ADB.
76.

Over the last two decades a number of donors have made significant contributions to the
Maldives. Prior to the tsunami, the Kuwait Fund was the single largest donor, followed by ADB, IsDB
and the World Bank. The Maldives has also been a recipient of grants, including from Japan. In
addition, the many parts of the UN system have been active over the years, contributing in total around
US$6 million per annum. The tsunami brought with it a large number of new donors including six Red
Cross societies that contributed more than US$120 million to the overall reconstruction program, and
collectively are the largest single contributor to the program. In the post tsunami era, the key donors
are likely to revert to those active prior to the tsunami.

77.
The donor assistance matrix included as Annex V, shows patterns of donor specialization.
Macro-economic and fiscal advice is provided mainly by the ADB, the IMF and the World Bank;

- 21 -

ADB and the World Bank support fiduciary management. The political dimensions of democratic
reform, social development and disaster management are generally the core focus of the UN system
(outside of their reconstruction activities). Infrastructure is largely the focus of the ADB and the IsDB
and other donors from Gulf Cooperation Council countries, notably the Kuwait Fund. Looking ahead
there are some gaps in the proposed future assistance, such as support for civil service reform and
environmental management. The latter is particularly striking given the importance of preserving the
country’s natural environment.

C.

PROPOSED STRATEGY AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

78.

The overarching objective of the World Bank Group program is to support the strategy and
goals of the 7NDP with a view to contributing towards continued improvements in standard of
living for all Maldivians. The integrated Bank Group will deploy both lending and non-lending
instruments, as well as private sector investments, in selective interventions. The interventions seek to
contribute to specific development outcomes, including: (a) a well-managed economy attracting
increased investment; (b) improved quality of education in support of a better skilled workforce and
(c) an enhanced capacity to manage the country’s pristine, but fragile, natural environment. Across
each of the three pillars, special focus will be given to strengthening institutions such as fiduciary
management and supporting the government’s plan to incentivize scale economies through population
consolidation.
Pillar I: Economic and fiscal governance

79.

This pillar aims to support government’s efforts to manage its economy and finances better,
while strengthening the investment climate. Following a request from the government, the Bank
Group will continue to work with the government on the development of a Medium Term Fiscal
Framework. This activity has been a major plank of the Bank’s assistance program during the last
CAS period. While at the technical level it has been successful at transferring knowledge, it is not yet
integrated into government’s decision processes.22 The activity seeks to bolster overall fiscal
discipline, better align public resources with the country’s development objectives, and enhance the
effectiveness of public expenditure. In the near term, this activity will also provide support to technical
cadres in the ministry who are working to manage the fiscal adjustment.

80.
The management of public finances has become a much more prominent issue following
the passage of the Public Finance Act in 2005. The government now places a high priority on further
strengthening of the fiscal governance in light of the pressures the tsunami placed on public finances.
To this end it is working to upgrade and modernize the accounting and financial management
infrastructure in order to ensure the effective utilization of public resources across service sectors. The
Bank Group has in recent years prioritized this area of work and has built good working relationships
with key ministries and donor partners.
In June 2007, the Bank published a ‘Gap Analysis’ on public financial management23 which
lays out a comprehensive agenda for bringing accounting and auditing standards in line with
international best practice. Following up this analysis with ongoing technical assistance to the Office
of Auditor General and to the Bank Group has also contributed towards public finance transparency by
strengthening the capacity in government for procurement, audit, and commercial adjudication.
Along with the EU-funded activity to upgrade the country’s Public Accounting System, this activity is

81.

22

A large technical assistance loan has just been agreed between the ADB and the government, part of which will support
activities geared towards strengthening the management of government’s finances. Tentatively it is anticipated the Bank will
provide high-level support to complement the consultant teams provided by ADB.
23
“Public Sector Accounting & Auditing: A Comparison to International Standards”, World Bank, June 2007.

- 22 -

ongoing and will be critical to whole-of-government public finance management capacity. As such,
they contribute both to the target development outcomes of the CAS, but also to the cross-cutting
agenda of institutional capacity development. Two Institutional Development Fund grants supporting
technical assistance cooperation are ongoing in the Ministry of Finance & Treasury and in the office of
the Auditor General. In addition, the Bank proposes to undertake in FY09 a Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment to establish a baseline against which progress can be
measured.

82.

The Bank Group is also proposing to undertake both lending and non-lending activities in
support of the government’s 7NDP strategy to enhance private sector development. In particular,
access to finance and the cost of finance emerged as the two main obstacles to business in the 2005
ICA.24 The financial sector of the Maldives is shallow and is dominated by the banking sector. In
recent years competition has been encouraged with the establishment of a Male’ branch of HSBC, the
rapid expansion of the Bank of the Maldives (BoM) branch network, and, with assistance from the
IFC, the establishment of a successful leasing company. The IFC will continue to support on-going
activities through collaborative investment and advisory services to a variety of financial institutions
in the country, with an initial focus on leasing and housing finance. In particular, the Maldives
Monetary Authority’s recent initiative with IFC to establish a private Credit Information Bureau
should reduce lending costs and expand access to credit, and is a step in the right direction.

83.

The country’s unusual (for the region) lack of a culture of savings and geo-spatial obstacles
act as constraints on the access to finance and the depth of the banking sector. The ICA noted that in
other countries such as Brazil and the Philippines the innovation of mobile phone banking has helped
overcome these constraints. In collaboration with CGAP, the Bank Group is currently preparing with
the Maldives Monetary Authority a mobile phone banking project. The project will aim to reduce the
levels of cash in the economy through the provision of universal access to formal financial services
including in the outer atolls. It will involve shaping an appropriate regulatory framework for
branchless banking, developing an interoperable retail payment system with sufficient volume to be
viable, and strengthening retail banking competition and greater access to banking through mobile
phones and a network of banking agents on the islands. The project is also a valuable opportunity to
collaborate across the Bank Group with IFC. It is helping the MMA develop a national credit bureau.

84.

Diversification of the economy is a critical component of the government’s 7NDP. The CAS
proposes analytical work to support the government’s efforts to increase the value added across a
broader range of economic activities. This work will likely link closely with any analytical work that
is done on generating economies of scale through greater connectivity and population consolidation. It
will also link to work of the IFC. The IFC will work with its major tourism clients on building bridges
between the tourism sector and small scale local industries. The IFC will consider further investments
in line with this strategy (including tourism and infrastructure) which can be demonstrated to help
diversify the economy. Finally, the Bank and IMF will discuss with the government the option of
undertaking a Report on Standards & Codes assessment (ROSC). The ROSC tool would be an
effective means of initiating the corporate governance reforms that the government has outlined in the
7NDP.
Pillar II: Human development and social protection

85.
While access to education has improved markedly, quality remains uneven. Teacher training
is a critical need – the country still relies heavily on expatriate teachers – as well as upgrading of the
curriculum and materials. Beyond the improvement in human development indicators, education is
24

The other main constraints were access to land, skilled labor and corruption.

- 23 -

necessary to expand the currently very limited pool of skilled business employees and administrators.
The World Bank has had extensive prior involvement in education, secondary and tertiary, and has
financed three education and training projects, plus additional activities through the IHDP and
Tsunami reconstruction project.

86.
The objective of pillar II is to strengthen the quality of public services for human
development and social protection. During the CAS period, the World Bank Group will support this
objective by providing additional finance to the education sector. This would extend activities
financed by the Third Education and Training project and those being financed under the IHDP. IEG’s
recently completed Implementation Completion Report for the Third Education and Training project
provides a road map for the new activities, in particular emphasizing quality of education rather thank
quantity as a core objective.
87.
Achieving this objective will require better trained teachers in the secondary schools and the
development of capacity for higher education in the country. Through the proposed additional
financing of the IHDP project the Bank will finance overseas scholarships for teachers to improve the
quality of higher secondary education on the focus islands. The additional financing will also finance
scholarships for higher level training to develop higher education teachers. Previous World Bank
projects have done this successfully in the past and the Maldives has a good record of those studying
overseas returning to the country. The additional financing needs for this would be about $4 million to
$7 million depending on the number and level of higher education teachers trained.
88.
Social protection is also a key theme of the Government’s reform program, critical for both
human development and long-term fiscal sustainability. In its efforts to engage in a more
programmatic way in the human development sector, the World Bank has worked with the
Government on a social protection strategy since 2003. The report “Social Protection in the
Maldives: Options for Reforming Social Assistance and Pensions” was prepared by the World Bank in
collaboration with the Government and outlined major strategic directions for reform. One of the main
gaps identified by this report was in pensions. Following further reforms to the pensions legal
framework the World Bank has discussed the outlines of a pension reform project that would support
the implementation of the framework with the objective of providing a fiscally sustainable pension
system as well as providing social protection for the old. Pension system reform would also deepen the
financial sector and support reforms in public administration.
Pillar III: Environmental Management

89.
The natural resource base of the country is unique and fragile. Furthermore, its protection
and proper management are central to the continued ability of the country to attract valuable tourism
revenues. The objective of pillar III is to improve environmental management practices and build
greater climate resilience to protect the pristine environment. During the CAS period the Bank Group
will work to support this objective through a proposed investment and analytical work. Unlike pillars
one and two, this pillar is new for the Bank Group and builds on the recommendation of the CAS
Completion Report and a stronger prioritization of the Government’s own investment towards
environmental protection.
90.
The Bank Group will support the Government’s priorities in this sector in three ways: (i)
strengthen environmental management capacity and skills in the government and of other
stakeholders, (ii) build a sound knowledge base to better address the environmental risks facing the
country; (iii) mitigate the threats to nature based tourism by improving environmental infrastructure;
(iv) implement a strategy to build climate resilience and adapt to the impending risks of climate
change.

- 24 -

91.
These would be achieved through targeted interventions that build upon the Government’s
priorities and policies. Including support for a project aimed at building environmental management
capacity and technical assistance for adaptation to climate change. The latter would be based on a risk
assessment at the atoll and island level and would identify cost effective adaptation strategies,
including the identification of safe islands. To be effective, the Bank will forge a closer partnership
with United Nations Environmental Agency (UNEP) and maintain the close working relationship with
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
Cross-cutting Issues

92.
Two themes cut across the program and underpin the country’s future development progress:
institutional capacity and population consolidation. Institutional capacity in the Maldives remains
lower than that of an average upper middle income country. The population now expects public
service delivery at a level that the administration is currently not able to provide.
93.
Institutional weakness is partly a result of a weak legal framework. For example, the lack of
modern legal frameworks governing the public sector, including its independence, the quality of its
performance and the competence of civil servants is underlined by the 7NDP as a core challenge for
the Maldives. Going forward, the Government is attempting to address many of these issues through
the wide-ranging reform effort of the public services. Institutional weakness is also a question of
capacity and training. For example, the Ministry of Energy, Environment and Water must assess an
average of 60-70 Environmental Impact Assessments a year with only four trained graduates in total in
the ministry.
94.
The World Bank Group program is addressing institutional weakness across its portfolio
because it will impact the degree to which the objectives of the pillars can be achieved. The IDF grants
for public financial management and budgeting & planning aim to support strengthening of core
functions of the state that will impact across government sectors. Equally, the long-running support to
the education sector is aiming to improve the standard of skills available in the education sector. The
proposed environmental project also seeks to upgrade the capacity of the relevant agencies.
95.

Population consolidation is a long-running theme in government discussions but still lacks
the direction of a clear policy that is understood commonly across government agencies and by the
population. According to the 7NDP, the cost of providing and maintaining socio-economic services in
the Maldives is 4-5 times higher than in other small-island developing economies. The Population and
Development Consolidation (PDC) program that seeks to address the issue through incentives is
currently weakened by the populist tendency of politicians seeking to curry favor through the
provision of increasingly expensive services to small communities. The World Bank Group should
aim to support the 7NDP’s stated policy by ensuring its own program design continues to promote
genuine incentives for consolidation. To date, the World Bank has and will continue to support PDC
through the IHDP project which supported service delivery on the focus islands.25 In addition, the
proposed program includes a future AAA activity to support government’s implementation of this
policy. Currently, it is envisage that this would examine the linkages between PDC and economic
diversification. Meanwhile, IFC have initiated a TA designed to help strengthen the economic links
between the islands and the resorts.

25

The term ‘focus island’ is no longer used in official Government documents.

- 25 -

CAS Program

96.

The proposed CAS program is laid out in Table 7 below. The program for FY10, FY11 &
FY12 will be further elaborated during the CAS period and reviewed as part of the CAS Progress
Report. The content and product mix will depend on progress on the reform agenda.

97.
Given the relatively small IDA allocation, making an effective contribution will mean that
the Bank Group’s work must be selective, catalytic and well-coordinated with other donors. The
CAS spans the last year of IDA14, 3 years of IDA15, and the first year of IDA16. The overall size of
the IDA envelope during the 5-year CAS period is assumed to be about SDR 30 million (about US$45
million), including about SDR13.2 million (US$20 million) in FY08 of resources remaining from
IDA14, and annual resources of about SDR 4 million during each of the subsequent years (US$6
million per year).26 27
98.

Interventions are proposed that build on progress and relationships established by previous
operations. They also aim to establish a three pillar platform for a more long-term or programmatic
approach to Bank Group assistance, as proposed by the previous CAS, that will sustain its relevance
over the next five years. Despite the short-term risks posed by an expansionary fiscal policy, World
Bank Group management is committed to stay engaged with the authorities through a program that
supports the long-term growth path.

99.
The proposed program has built-in flexibility. Because the CAS period straddles the end of
the 7NDP program and the first half of the next five year government strategy the mid-term review of
the CAS, scheduled for FY10, will coincide with the start of the Government’s next strategy. This will
be an opportunity, therefore, to review CAS progress against the indicators of the CAS Results Matrix
as well as fine-tune a program in line with the Government’s priorities in the next plan. For this
reason, this program is more detailed on the first two years of the CAS program.

Estimates for IDA15 are based on performance in FY08 and assumptions about the size of the IDA15 replenishments.
Actual allocations during the CAS period will be determined on an annual basis and will depend on: (i) total IDA resources
available in IDA15 and IDA16, (ii) the country’s performance rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA
borrowers; (iv) the terms of IDA's assistance to the Maldives (credits or grants), and (v) the number of IDA-eligible

Product mix

100.

While the IDA allocation is fixed the mix of products is not. The World Bank Group will
ensure that the instruments used are consistent with the country’s development context. In particular, a
responsive program of analytical work has proved constructive in the Maldives in the past and is
consistent with the World Bank Group’s strategy for middle income countries. In addition, the
proposed sector lending program assumes that authorities manage the current risks and avert a crisis.
However, it is also possible that expenditures may continue to rise, further endangering economic
conditions. If this occurs the World Bank Group would have to adjust its program accordingly in
partnership with other donors and the IMF to support resolution of the structural issues where possible.

101.

Development policy lending is preferable – but will be contingent on demonstrated reforms.
If the authorities are able to re-establish fiscal balance within a sustainable macro-economic
framework that is satisfactory to the World Bank, then a development policy lending operation (DPL)
would be considered. To this end, a DPL operation is under consideration for FY10, and is reflected in
the program table above. The sector focus under the DPL would be consistent with the overall
assistance framework set out in this document. If a DPL is not feasible, IDA resources will be
channeled towards additional financing for sector operations.

- 27 -

102. In the future, the Maldives should aim for IBRD creditworthiness. Maldives eligibility for
IBRD lending could also be considered as part of the CAS Progress Report at mid-term. The
uncertainties posed by recent expansionary policies and the political transition make it inopportune to
consider an IBRD envelope at present. However, with fiscal correction, the conditions might be right
to assess the creditworthiness of the country.
V.

RESULTS MONITORING AND EVALUATION

103.

In recent years, the government has sought to strengthen its monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) systems. The databases it maintains provide an increasingly satisfactory set of statistics, with
some variations in relative quality. The economic and fiscal data sets maintained by government are
generally adequate for the government and donors to monitor performance at a national level. There is
room for improvement, especially with regard to (a) the preparation and timely availability of budget
implementation data, (b) GDP from the expenditure side, and (c) the composition of private capital
flows in the balance of payments. Working with government, the Bank’s economic team will seek to
update the statistical tables at least twice a year. A simple fiscal model has been developed jointly by
the Government and the Bank’s economic team, using a nested set of spreadsheets. This will be used
for this purpose.

104. To monitor improvements in the performance of institutions responsible for managing and
monitoring public expenditures, a simple institutional audit will be undertaken in mid-2009 and
compared against current performance.
105. To monitor performance of financial institutions and access to finance, a limited survey will
be undertaken in mid-2009, and compared against the results of the ICA, completed in 2005.
106. Data collected on poverty trends and on key social sectors, like education and health, is in
general adequate. The recently completed ICR for the Third Education and Training project provides a
useful set of baseline data for the education sector. When complimented by data collected for the
M&E component of the IHDP project, a useful data set is available. These data sets will be updated at
regular intervals should an additional lending operation be prepared for the sector.
107. More generally, the household level data from the government’s household expenditure
surveys and Poverty and Vulnerability Surveys, provides a fairly complete picture of social indicators
and trends. A Maldivian version of InfoDev has also recently been launched, with the help of
UNICEF.
108.

Some environmental data is available but there is much room for improvement. This will be a
focus for the proposed environment project that is currently being prepared.

109. Monitoring will take place primarily through intensive project-level supervision, mid-term
project reviews, and other specific studies listed above. In addition, government’s policy performance
will be rated through the regular CPIA exercise and through regular assessments of the IMF. A review
of progress and lessons-learned under this CAS will be carried out at the mid-term review at the end of
FY10.

VI.

RISKS AND MITIGATION

110.

While potential country risks have been highlighted throughout this document, three
predominate: political instability, fiscal uncertainties, and potential issues associated with project
implementation.
Political Instability

111. The past four years have seen increasing political unrest and growing tensions between
government and opposition. However, the track record of the Maldives in containing major unrest is
encouraging. Its people are pragmatic, most seem to understand the importance of stability if
economic growth is to be maintained, and a steady improvement in the quality of life for the majority
provides an incentive for evolutionary rather than revolutionary change.
112.

There is little that the Bank can do to alleviate this risk directly. Other actors including the
EU, the Commonwealth, and the UN are better positioned to act as “honest brokers” between the
government and the opposition. These efforts have the potential for facilitating a national consensus
on political reforms. The Bank will continue to ensure that the projects and activities it supports are
likely to have broad based support from within the community. The participation of a range of
stakeholders will be sought when preparing projects. In addition, the South Asia Region has recently
held internal ‘Brainstorming sessions’ amongst Bank Group staff to stay abreast of developing
political situations and to discuss adjustments in the program if necessary.
Fiscal Uncertainty

113. In the absence of a fiscal crisis, it seems unlikely that the government will change course
before the elections scheduled for next year. To alleviate the risk that unsustainable fiscal deficits
derail implementation of the proposed program, in close cooperation with other development partners,
the Bank Group will continue to try and persuade the Government to adopt more realistic fiscal
policies. As noted above, the Bank Group, including IFC, would adjust its program accordingly,
particularly to support government actions to reduce its deficit. For new investment projects, fiscal
risks will be assessed and project design adapted to ensure sustainability even if short term fiscal
problems emerge.
Project Implementation

114. Based on past experience, capacity limitations constrain effective project implementation.
To alleviate this risk, all projects will include an institutional development focus, be kept simple and
will be tightly focused outputs and outcomes. The Bank will seek to coordinate mutual activities with
other donors, avoid creating new implementing entities, strengthen the capacity of core
implementation groups in existing ministries, and continue to help the government develop country
systems acceptable to the Bank and other donors.
115. There are no significant concerns about managing fiduciary risks in the Maldives portfolio.
At project level, Financial Management (FM) arrangements have been simplified by placing greater
reliance on country systems,28 enhanced report based disbursements,29 ensuring harmonization with

other donors and partners30 and focusing on preparing capacity building components for improving
FM performance for improving the quality of the portfolio and enhancing developmental impact.
Investment projects in the Maldives portfolio are adopting key elements of country FM systems,
except for External Audits which are conducted by acceptable and independent private firms, due to
capacity issues in the Audit office.

116. In terms of procurement, while there is currently limited capacity in the country, the
portfolio is safeguarded through ensuring that staff are trained upfront in procurement. However,
staff turnover – through transfers or on overseas training - can result in a higher fiduciary risk during
project implementation. While the Tender Evaluation Board (TEB) is mandated to process all large
value public procurement, donor-financed projects are generally permitted to process all procurement,
with TEB approval, and following donor guidelines. It is envisaged to continue with the same
arrangements for the operations planned under the CAS period, while supporting the broader reform
agenda which will focus on improving country systems and developing capacity. In relation to
improving governance and accountability, focus has increased on strengthening operational controls,31
rather than just financial controls.

ANNEX II: Stakeholder Consultation
Page 1 of 1

ANNEX II: Stakeholder Consultation

1.
To determine development priorities Bank Group staff have, during the course of the last year,
had the opportunity to hold discussions with a variety of stakeholders (members of the public, business
people, and leaders of political parties) in Male’, and in the atolls. The preparation and supervision of
post-tsunami reconstruction activities gave Bank staff the opportunity to travel relatively widely in
many parts of the country. Staff were also fortunate to be involved in the preparation of the UN’s
Common Country Assessment during 2006 and 2007 and participated in UN consultations both in
Male’ and on selected islands.
2.
The economy: For those outside Male’, job opportunities remains the critical issue of concern
among the population. Fishermen also complained about the price of the catch, the absence of local
fish markets, difficulty of accessing the nearest processing plant or collection vessels, and the lack of
harbor facilities. Similarly, on islands where farming is a more prominent occupation, the lack of
suitable land was a common complaint. Farmers are also seeking greater government support with
marketing. Across the board, access to finance, particularly for small businesses, was a key constraint.
Only 20 islands out of the 198 inhabited islands have a Bank of the Maldives branch. Even where
there is a branch, accessing loans was not guaranteed.
3.
Public services: In the Atolls, the quality of the local school and health facilities, the lack of
sanitation, and solid waste disposal systems, were all common complaints. Furthermore, there was
only limited support for community contributions, or direct support of the provision of such services:
on most islands, the communities expect the government to provide and pay for the services.
4.

Population consolidation: In the atolls most people had heard about the policy but
complained that there had been little discussion or consultation, even on so-called safe or focus
islands. In Male’, the policy of population consolidation generally had the support of most of the elite
and of the political parties with which it was discussed.

5.

Governance: There was much interest in and discussion of current political reforms. Given
these are proving to be difficult, and even contentious in some areas, discussion about the role of
government often took a political slant. However, amongst those with more knowledge of the Bank
Group’s interest, discussions generally turned to concerns about the size and dangers of the current
budget. Also, it is clear that the conflict of interest and corruption are well recognized as important
concerns which will need to be addressed

This assessment evaluates the World Bank Group’s contribution to the development of the
Maldives between 2000 and 2006, focusing on the program of activities outlined in the CAS discussed
and approved by the Board on November 22, 2000. This CAS was intended to cover the period up to
the end of 2004; however, on December 26, 2004 the country was struck by a devastating tsunami
which caused damage equivalent to more than 60 percent of the country’s GDP, thereby requiring an
urgent extension of the CAS period.

Despite the shocks created by this disaster, the country’s economy and social indicators have
continued to improve, as measured against the core benchmarks provided in the 2000 CAS.

It is more difficult to assess the precise impact of the Bank’s interventions. The CAS

objectives were to strengthen human development, expenditure management, and the business
environment. Against the first objective, project evaluation reports clearly demonstrate that the Bank
has had a significant impact in supporting the government’s efforts to improve both the quality and
quantity of secondary and tertiary education in the country, particularly in the atolls. Against the
second objective, while the political buy-in for sound fiscal management is still limited, with the
support of the Bank, the government is actively strengthening fiduciary management functions—
accounting, procurement and audit. Against the third objective, the Bank Group has provided timely

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report

support to help the government strengthen the investment climate for private investors and in
particular has had some success in helping government increase access to credit.

Overall, the Bank Group’s performance was satisfactory.

The lessons for the new CAS include the following:






I.

Be selective: The Bank made a difference because it was selective, with a program
designed in close consultation with government.
Retain flexibility: Particularly in a middle-income country, the Bank Group’s program
needs to retain some flexibility. Circumstances change as do the government’s interests
and priorities.
Focus objectives and monitor: The objectives of the new assistance strategy should be
tightly focused with a monitoring and evaluation framework that is both realistic and cost
effective.
Keep it simple: The capacity of the Maldives government to deliver an increasingly
sophisticated range of services is an issue, as the country approaches upper middle-income
status.
Maintain field presence: Opening a local office has improved communications with our
clients and allowed the Bank Group to be fully responsive to the government’s demands
and interests.

INTRODUCTION

1.

This assessment evaluates the Bank Group’s contribution to the development of the Maldives
between 2000 and 2006, focusing on the program of activities outlined in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), discussed and approved by the Board on November 22, 2000.1 .

2.

The CAS was intended to cover the period up to the end of 2004. However, on December 26,
2004 the country was struck by a devastating tsunami which caused damage equivalent to more than
60 percent of the country’s GDP. Consequently, the Bank agreed to extend its existing assistance
program to include emergency reconstruction activities, and to delay the preparation of a new
assistance strategy until 2007. Implementation of the tsunami reconstruction activities continues to test
the Government’s management and administrative abilities.

3.

Between 2000 and 2006, the Bank Group’s financial contribution was modest compared to the
size of the Maldives’ economy. It amounted to less than 3 percent of government expenditures, which
equaled $211 million in 2000 and $662 million in 2006, and totaled almost $2.4 billion over the
period. Since the approval of the CAS in 2000, the Board has approved two IDA credits with total
commitments of $29.6 million and four IFC transactions totaling $48 million. A full list of the Bank
Group’s activities is included as Attachment A.

In parallel OED prepared a Country Assistance Evaluation of the Bank’s program from 1978 to 1999. It concluded that the
Bank’s involvement had been satisfactory, but expressed concern that the fishing industry was still dominated by a single
government SOE, MIFCO, even though the Bank had financed three fisheries projects. This led to concerns about the
institutional development impact (rated as moderate) and the sustainability of the three fishing projects (rated as uncertain).
The report summarized the challenges for the Maldives as broadening its economic base, expanding access to social services
in the Atolls, developing a sustainable social safety net and protecting the country’s natural environment. A summary is
provided in Attachment E.

PROGRESS OF THE COUNTRY SINCE 2000

5.
The 2000 CAS was prepared immediately prior to the beginning of the Sixth National
Development Plan (2001 to 2005) (6NDP) period and just at the end of the Fifth Plan period (1996 to
2000) (5NDP). It covered a period of continued growth in the Maldives, which pushed it rapidly
towards upper middle-income status.
6.
As summarized in the CAS, the overall development objective of the government was
improving living standards, especially in outer atolls, by sustaining its impressive economic and
social advances well into the future, with a vision for the county rooted in:






improved living standards and reduced disparities between Male’ and the outer islands;
a robust economy based on the sustainable use of marine resources for tourism and fishing;
the planned south and north growth poles being well established;
high quality education and health services; and
a decentralized administration and well developed legal and judicial systems.

7.
Following the tsunami of December 26, 2004, the government was faced with the huge and
additional challenge of reconstructing its heavily damaged country. However, despite the shocks
created by this disaster, the country’s economy and social indicators have continued to improve, as
measured against the core benchmarks provided in the 2000 CAS.3

The government did an outstanding job in organizing and managing the implementation of
the relief activities. Most civil servants worked very long hours for many months to ensure that relief
was delivered to the affected people as quickly and as effectively as possible. The reconstruction
activities have proved more difficult to manage. While substantial parts of the program have already

document as measures of performance.

been delivered, much still remains to be done. The politics surrounding its implementation have
proved difficult for the government to manage, given the high expectations generated by the initial and
very effective recovery activities. While reconstruction has taken longer than expected, almost all
activities are still expected to be completed by end-2008.
Economic performance since 2000

9.

Following the tsunami, the sharp drop in tourist arrivals caused the economy to contract by
5 percent in 200,5 but it rebounded by 18 percent in 2006 (compared to 2005) with the return of the
tourists. Even so, growth averaged 6.3 percent between 2000 and 2006, compared to a CAS target of
7.0 percent per annum. Growth in 2007 is also expected to be on the order of 7 percent. However, the
current risks for the economy are not insignificant. The most immediate one is created by the highly
expansionary budgets of 2006 and 2007. These have eroded the Government’s reputation for sound
fiscal management, and almost certainly undermined its ability to weather even small perturbations in
the economy. The national budget for 2007 is equivalent to 93 percent of GDP.
Poverty alleviation

10.

Since 2000, the number of people living in poverty in the Maldives has continued to decline.
The third of a series of Vulnerability and Poverty Assessments, conducted in 2005,4 showed that
poverty has declined rapidly since 1997. It concluded that by mid-2005 absolute poverty had
effectively been eliminated, using a poverty line of US1 per day (purchasing power parity), or Rf4.34
per day. However, if the poverty line is set at Rf15 per day (approximately US3 per day if adjusted for
purchasing power parity), then 19 percent of the population still lives in poverty.
Regional Disparities.

11.

Economic disparities persist. Few jobs are being created outside the resorts. There is also a
significant wage differential between the capital and the other inhabited islands, reported to be as high
as 3:1. The attempts to create economic poles in the north and south have also met with limited
success. However, as will be demonstrated later in this report, the quality of social services in the
atolls has improved significantly.
Box 1. Maldives and the MDGs
The MDGs were being discussed and agreed by the international community at the time the 2000 CAS was
being prepared. The goals are not referred to in its text. However, an MDG progress report was published in
2005 and was recently updated. These two reports conclude that five out of the seven core MDGs have
already been achieved by the Maldives. The two exceptions were those for gender equality and
environment. With respect to the former, the reports highlighted three issues—the need to address the
gender imbalance in the labor force, the need to provide greater protection for women who are subject to
domestic violence, and the need to increase the participation of women in the country so as to ensure that
the legal, economic and political rights of women are preserved. With respect to the environment, the
country is not doing enough to protect its unique environment. Furthermore, while it is has formally met the
relevant MDG, child malnutrition remains a serious issue for the country with 25 percent of children still
considered to be under-weight.

4

Vulnerability and Poverty Assessments (VPA) were undertaken in 1997, 2004 (pre-tsunami) and 2005 (post-tsunami). The
assessments were each prepared by consultants, for the Ministry of Planning and National Development. The second was
partially supported by the World Bank. The third in the series is known as the Tsunami Impact Assessment Study (TIAS).

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 5 of 27

Public Sector Management and Administration

12.
The quality of public administration remains a concern. However, this deficiency is
recognized by government and is now being actively addressed, following the recent passage of the
Civil Service Act. Despite a large increase in the number of civil servants (from 26,790 in 2000 to
34,033 in 2005), there is a shortage of essential skills in almost all departments. Furthermore, because
of a weak civil service structure, staff are too often poorly motivated. Even before the tsunami, the
lack of implementation capacity was apparent for externally funded projects and activities.
13.
Corruption is an issue for the country, as found by the 2005 Investment Climate Assessment,
and confirmed by the modest corruption perception rating assigned to the Maldives by Transparency
International in a recent report.5 A related issue is the web of “conflict of interests” within the
country—a common problem in many small nations. There is a requirement for greater transparency
and clearer definition of roles, including the development of a fully professional civil service.
Strengthening Human Development

14.
Strengthening social services has been a primary objective of government for more than a
quarter of a century, during which time their quality has dramatically improved, particularly in the
atolls.
15.

Even before 2000, access to primary education was universal, however, a much smaller
proportion had access to secondary schools. Today, lower secondary schools (up to grade 10) are
located on 138 islands, compared to only 74 in 2000), and higher secondary schools are located on 15
islands compared to 5 in 2000. As a result, the transition rate from primary to secondary school was 66
percent in 2004 compared to a CAS target of 50 percent, and girls’ enrolment in lower secondary
schools was in excess of 100 percent compared to a CAS target of 71 percent. However, the quality of
education remains an issue and learning achievements are mixed. For example, the “O” level pass rate
is only 20 percent, with the schools in the atolls faring much worse.

16.
A similar picture can be drawn for the health sector—improved access with residual quality
issues. The total number of atoll hospitals, health centers and health posts has more than doubled since
2001. Statistics show that all health indicators are moving in the right direction, for example, child
mortality has dropped from 21 per 1000 births in 2000 to 12 in 2005. However, new challenges are
emerging, such as dengue, influenza, and scrub typhus. Also, while there have been improvements,
child malnutrition is proving to be an enduring problem within the country. Almost a quarter of
children were underweight in 2005 compared to more than 30 percent in 2000, 45 percent in
1997/1998, and a CAS target of 30 percent for 2006. Stunting and wasting statistics are equally
striking.
17.
Two additional challenges are addressed in the CAS, improving the business environment
and protection of the environment.

5

The Maldives’ rating was 3.3. Of the other countries in region, Bhutan is rated the least corrupt country with a rating of
3.8, India earned a rating of 3.5, while all other countries in the region were rated lower than the Maldives.

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 6 of 27

Improving the business environment
Despite shortcomings in the investment framework,6 the role of the private sector has
continued to expand with most government monopolies now facing direct competition. Over the last
six years, the government has also taken steps to strengthen the financial sector (including creating the
Maldives Leasing Company and the Housing Development Finance Corporation) while the Bank of
the Maldives has greatly expanded its network of branches and services, and HSBC established a
branch in Male’ in 2002. However, constraints remain. The recently completed Investment Climate
Assessment found that access to land was a major issue. Also, there is no sound framework of
commercial law while state-owned enterprises continue to dominate important sectors.

18.

19.
Tourism and fisheries continue to provide the backbone of the economy. The government
has recently published a new master plan for the development of the tourism sector. It foresees a
gradual expansion on the number of beds available over the coming five years, and since 2003 has
awarded 46 new resort leases. In addition, the second most important industry in the Maldives,
fisheries, is to be fully privatized. This industry was transformed in 2000 by the decision to award
operating licenses to four private fish processing companies, with the state-owned company, MIFCO,
retaining an important but no-longer dominant role.
20.
It is striking that the ICA did not highlight infrastructure bottlenecks as a major concern
for existing businesses. Since 2000, mobile phones have become ubiquitous and are readily available
to almost all, with 262,000 active accounts at the end of March 2007—compared to only 8,000 in
2000. In contrast, transport and electricity provision is not as satisfactory. There are still relatively few
scheduled internal transport services, and while the availability of electricity has also improved in
recent years, service provision remains an issue. Not all islands yet have a 24 hour supply.
Protecting the environment

21.
Rather surprisingly, not enough attention has or is being given to the protection of the
natural environment, by either government or donors. The natural environment of the Maldives is
unique and fragile and will likely suffer from the impacts of global warming, in particular the rise in
sea level. The tsunami emphasized the vulnerability of the country and has provided a strong incentive
for it to manage its fragile environment more effectively. Protecting the environment remains a major
challenge for the government and citizens. All islands are small and vulnerable, with no island being
more than 3 meters above seal level. The country’s coral reefs are also extensive and vital resources
for the countries two primary industries—fishing and tourism. They required better stewardship.
However, there is lack of both government and donor leadership in the sector.
22.

While there are residual concerns about environmental standards and practices of the
resorts, these are dwarfed by the environmental concerns on inhabited islands. The resort operators
have a major incentive to protect the environment on their islands—no tourist wants to come to an
island surrounded by raw sewerage and waste. On the inhabited islands, there have been some
improvements in the provision of basic environmental services, particularly since the tsunami, as a
direct result of much greater donor interest. Even so, the provision of reliable supplies of safe drinking
water still remains a challenge on some islands, and most still lack appropriate sanitation and solid
waste collection systems.

6
According to the recently completed Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), published in 2005, the top five obstacles to
private sector investment were access to finance, access to land, cost of finance, the shortage potential employees with
appropriate skills and education, and corruption.

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report

III.

WHAT HAS THE WORLD BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTED SINCE 2000?

23.

The overarching objective of the CAS was to assist the country with:

“the reduction of poverty and regional disparities in access to social and infrastructure services. To
advance this objective, the strategy, in partnership with other donors, aims at supporting: (i)
sustainable economic growth; (ii) improvements in public sector management, including
institutional capacity; and (iii) human development.”

24.
The CAS also identifies four core challenges that had to be addressed if the objective was to
be advanced.7 It also included indicators to assess the progress against each of these challenges. These
were: protection of the environment, strengthening the macroeconomic framework and public
expenditure management, strengthening human development, and improving the business
environment.
25.
To further the objectives and address the challenges, the World Bank funded a single
operation, an Integrated Human Development Project (IHDP), while a second project funded part of
the government’s tsunami reconstruction program. The Bank also supported a number major AAA
activities, including a public expenditure review, a country economic update, a review of tobacco use
in the Maldives, a report on social protection, an investment climate assessment and a review of the
fisheries industry. In addition, the Bank provided technical assistance to strengthen expenditure
planning, as well as the public audit and procurement functions.
26.
Meanwhile IFC provided finance for a shipping company, a mobile telecoms operator, and
two resort companies. It also provided finance, equity and technical assistance for the Maldives
Leasing Company. In addition, it is providing technical assistance to the Maldives central bank to
support the establishment of a credit bureau and for the privatization of the Maldives Housing
Development Housing Corporation. A full list of the Bank Group activities is provided in Attachment
A. The impacts of the assistance program are summarized in the CAS Completion Matrix,
(Attachment B).
27.

This section assesses the impact of the Bank’s program using the indicators listed in the CAS
for each of the core challenges. However, it first looks at the interim outcomes of the ongoing tsunami
reconstruction activities, funded by the Bank Group.
The World Bank Group response to the tsunami disaster

28.
Within days of the tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations
system, and the Bank were working with the government to prepare a damage assessment report.
This report was finished at the end of February 2005 and provided the government with a timely and
important point of reference for all subsequent reconstruction activities.
29.
In parallel, the Bank prepared and appraised the Post Tsunami Emergency Relief and
Reconstruction Project, which was approved by the Board on March 15, 2005 and signed two days
later, for a loan amount of $14.1 million. This loan helped finance cash grants to affected persons,
the reconstruction of schools, and some technical assistance. A year later, the European Union (EU)
added additional funds equivalent to $17 million to the project to finance an improved public
7

A fifth challenge was listed--addressing key issues for tourism, fisheries and land, housing and urban development. In this
document these issues are discussed as issues related to the improvement of the business environment.

accounting system (to be used initially to manage the tsunami reconstruction funds), school
reconstruction activities, health facilities, and a solid waste management component. The
implementation of all components is proceeding satisfactorily, with the original Bank-funded
components close to completion. In consultation with the government, the Bank chose to finance
activities which could be implemented by agencies with which it had an established working
relationship and who were familiar with our procedures. This greatly facilitated project
implementation and the quick and effective application of the funds.

30.
Following the Tsunami in 2004, IFC also provided funds for reconstruction and TA activities.
In 2005, the IFC Board approved a Tsunami Tourism Loan Facility to provide long-term financing to
tourism companies affected by the 2004 tsunami in Asia. This was available for the reconstruction and
refurbishment of properties and to allow for the restructuring of existing loans so to ensure that they
could be serviced. One Maldives resort developer took advantage of this facility.
31.
Commentary. The Bank Group’s response to the tsunami reconstruction was timely and
effective. It provided the country with prompt assistance to prepare and fund the tsunami
reconstruction program. In contrast with most other donors, the Bank also proved flexible with respect
to the application of its funds. For example, the Bank was one of a very few donors prepared to fund
immediate cash grants for the affected communities. It also provided a particularly flexible source of
technical assistance funds that could be used to reinforce the capacity of any agency involved in
implementing reconstruction activities. The Bank Group’s flexibility was appreciated by government.
Strengthening Human Development

32.
A specific recommendation of the CAS was to “gradually switch to a programmatic approach”
to lending, increasing the breadth of activities support within the human development (HD) sector. In
response, the actual deliveries were a multi-sectoral human development project and a major sector
report on the social security system. Each is briefly described in Attachment C to this report.
Outcomes are assessed below for education; health, (and nutrition), social protection; and reduction in
regional disparities.
33.
Education. The following table summarizes the country’s performance against the indicators
provided in the CAS for education, and lists the Bank Group’s inputs for the sector.

Note. Following a policy change in 2005 students are promoted automatically from Grade 7 to 8 (first year of
secondary school). Hence this outcome overstates the benefits achieved. Data of the last year before this policy
change, 2004, recorded a transition rate of 66%.

34.
Commentary. As demonstrated by the information provided above, the outcomes for the
education sector are very positive. In this sector, the Bank has had an important impact, as is well
documented in the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) for the recently completed
education and training project8 and in the OED report for the two earlier education and training
projects.9 It is also clear that the Bank’s activities of the last six years, benefited from the foundations
created by the previous 12 years of work in the education sector. Over a period of two decades, the
Bank Group has developed a strong rapport with the Ministry of Education and has been influential in
helping the government develop appropriate policies, expand access and begin to monitor more
closely the quality of its schools.
35.

Health. The table below assesses the country’s performance against the indicators provided in
the CAS. However, it is noted that the Bank Group’s input were limited to the preparation activities
for the IHDP. This project is currently being implemented. Outcomes are not yet measurable.

36.
Commentary. These encouraging performance indicators show that the government is
making good progress in the health sector, working closely with other donors, especially the WHO
and UNICEF, with whom the Ministry of Health has had long-term relationships. In contrast, the Bank
Group only recently became involved in this sector, as it prepared the IHDP. This project is currently
under implementation and it is too early to make an assessment of its impact.
37.
Social Protection. The CAS did not explicitly anticipate the Bank’s preparation of a report on
the strengthening of the country’s framework for social protection. However, this addition to the
program was in line with the recommendation that more programmatic approaches should be adopted
for lending in the sector. While no firm decisions have yet been made to follow-up on the
recommendations of the completed study, government ownership is high. The expected
implementation of the recommended pension scheme would be a significant outcome, and obviously
justify the Bank broadening its interests within the HD sector.
38.
Reducing Regional Disparities. The CAS emphasized on the improvement of social services
in the atolls, while in addition to proposing indicators for strengthening micro-credit and the
collection of basic poverty data. With respect to the latter, the Bank Group has been able to impact
outcomes through the Third Education Project and IHDP.

40.
Commentary. As discussed above, access to social services in the atolls has improved
significantly since 2000. The Bank can claim some credit for this outcome, given the focus on these
issues of the Third Education and Training Project, and more recently in the IHDP. With full
implementation of the IHDP, the Bank’s contribution will be even stronger—its primary objective is
to strengthen social services on four islands, identified as future population centers.
41.
With respect to the collection of poverty data, the Bank provided modest support to the
Ministry of Planning to finance the implementation of the second Poverty and Vulnerability Survey.
More importantly, the Ministry is continuing to focus on the collection of basic poverty and human
development statistics, with help from the UNDP and UNICEF.
Management of Public Expenditures

42.
The CAS set very high expectations for budgetary reform, with a major focus on medium-term
planning and expenditure management. To address, these issues, the Bank’s program of technical
assistance had two major foci:
o Firstly, the Bank provided advice and assistance to help the government manage its
budget preparation processes better, and to develop medium-term fiscal forecasts and
plans. This included a public expenditure review, a country economic update, an IDF
grant to strengthen the Ministry of Finance’s ability to develop a medium-term fiscal plan,
and Bank staff provided direct technical assistance to the ministry to further the same
objective.

o Secondly, the Bank provided extensive assistance to strengthen fiduciary management
functions within government, so as to ensure that public funds are spent correctly. This
part of the program was much larger than originally anticipated in the CAS, reflecting
changing priorities within both the Bank and the country. The Bank has provided IDF
grants to strengthen the Government’s audit and procurement functions. In addition, the
Bank supported a comparative study between best practice public sector accounting
standards and those in use in the Maldives. Finally, the Bank is also supporting the
implementation of a public accounting system, financed by the EU through a trust fund
managed by the Bank.

43.
Assessment of Outcomes. For these activities, the following table compares the CAS
indicators with actual outcomes.

Introduce three year rolling program

formulated as well prioritized and fully
funded core expenditure program.

Limited progress against the
listed indicators except that a
much larger group of staff in
the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Planning and the
central bank are familiar with

medium term budgeting.

Bank funded a public
expenditure review and
a country economic
report.

Prior to tsunami, the political
commitment to multi-year
budgetary planning was
strong.

Bank provided an IDF
grant to strengthen
medium term fiscal
planning in Ministry of
Finance.

Develop medium and long term
strategies for the key sectors and
formulate consistent, high impact
sectoral public expenditure programs.
Develop well prioritized public
expenditure programs that are
consistent with sectoral strategies and
with the objective of reducing poverty
and regional disparities.
Reverse the upward trend in the
general services outlays to restrain the
growth of low priority current
expenditure and allocate sufficient
resources for social sector and
infrastructure recurrent expenditures.

Bank’s economic team
provided extensive
technical assistance.

Post tsunami, the political
commitment to multi-year
budgetary planning is weak.
(2007 budget = 92% of
GDP).

44.
Commentary. With respect to the first set of activities designed to strengthen expenditure
planning, the impact of the Bank has been limited. It might be more evident if a “before and after
survey” had been undertaken to assess the abilities of the technical staff in the key economic agencies.
However, in terms of policy outcomes, the Bank’s efforts to improve medium-term fiscal planning and
budgeting seem to have had little impact upon the decisions of the politicians.
45.
The second set of activities was designed to improve fiduciary management functions within
government. This line of assistance has been more successful. No indicators were provided in the
CAS to measure the impact or effectiveness of these activities. However, the passage of the Public
Finance Act in 2005, and the Audit Act in 2007, are both positive signs of the government’s
commitments to manage public expenditures more actively. While both Acts have yet to be fully
implemented, there is every indication that the Bank’s efforts in this area will lead to very positive
outcomes.
Strengthening the Business Environment

46.

To address this challenge, the World Bank engaged in a series of AAA activities that directly
or indirectly support the refinement of the framework for private sector development in the Maldives.
These were the investment climate assessment, the continuing reform of the fisheries sector, and
studies of land and housing policy. In addition, the IFC supported a number of advisory activities to
strengthen the financial sector, as well as making a number of investments in a variety of sectors,
including tourism, shipping, and the country’s second mobile phone operator.

47.
Assessment of outcomes. The list of indicators included in the CAS, and summarized in the
attached table, was rather restrictive and does not fully reflect the breadth of the Bank Group’s
activities to support this line of activity.

Commentary. Even though constraints remain,10 the business environment has improved
since 2000. Some of the most concrete outcomes for this line of business were directly supported by
the IFC. In particular, its support for the creation of the Maldives Leasing Company, established in
2002, added another dimension to the financial services sector in the country. In addition, potential
benefits from the IFC supported privatization of the Maldives Housing Finance Development
Corporation would be substantial—removing, at least in part, one obstacle to the development of land
and housing markets.

48.

49.
During the last six years the fisheries business has changed dramatically. The earlier
unpublished technical assistance report and projects certainly influenced the initial reforms of 2000.
As a result, the private sector already has a very substantial role in this critical industry. However, the
recommendations of the recently completed Bank-supported study will certainly guide future
government actions and could prove even more influential as the government adapts to its new role as
a regulator of one of its most important natural resources.
50.

With respect to micro-credit, the joint UNDP/World Bank evaluation of the government
managed micro-credit program concluded that it was not well managed and that the World Bank’s
support for the program should cease. The market is being relatively well served by the Bank of the
Maldives’ development banking operations. The evaluation also concluded that the market for microcredit services was very small, highly dispersed and unviable.
Protecting the Environment

51.
There were no Bank supported programs for protection of the environment. With the
exception of a solid waste management component currently being implemented through the
emergency project, no substantial activities were listed in the CAS against this challenge and none
were provided.
Overall Assessment of the Bank Group Program

52.
The country has made real progress since 2000. The economy has continued to expand.
Also, with respect to the primary CAS objective of poverty alleviation the country’s performance has
been very positive. Human development outcomes also have been strong.
53.
It is more difficult to assess the precise impact of the Bank’s interventions. The CAS
objectives were to strengthen human development, expenditure management, and the business
environment. Against the first objective, project evaluation reports clearly demonstrate that the Bank
has had a significant impact in supporting the government’s efforts to improve both the quality and
quantity of secondary and tertiary education in the country, particularly in the Atolls. Against the
second objective, while the political buy-in for sound fiscal management is still limited, the
government is actively taking steps to manage its actual expenditures more effectively and to
strengthen the fiduciary management functions of government, supported by the Bank. Against the
third objective, the Bank Group has provided timely support to help the government strengthen the
investment climate for private investors, and in particular, has had some success in increasing access
to credit.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

54.
Overall, the CAS provided a satisfactory and durable framework for our regular assistance
program. It focused on three key development issues—human development, expenditure
management, and the environment for business. However, it was also sufficiently broadly drawn to
allow some flexibility with respect to what was actually delivered, in response to demands from
government. Both the Bank Group and the government were further tested by the tsunami. It was an
exceptional event that demanded an exceptional response, obviously outside the framework provided
by the CAS.
55.
Quality and appropriateness of lending operations. The design and execution of the three
projects approved by the Board between 2000 and 2005, has generally been satisfactory. The quick
response of the Bank following the tsunami, and its early approval of the reconstruction project, were
also much appreciated by government.
56.
All projects were well received by government, with demonstrated ownership during both
preparation and implementation. However, the quality of implementation has not always been
satisfactory. All projects were rated as unsatisfactory or marginally unsatisfactory for short periods.
These ratings reflect of the lack of technical and policy-making capacity in almost all ministries.
Specifically, while in most ministries the upper levels are staffed by experienced and competent staff,
there is a relative dearth of competent mid-level staff with enough experience and technical
knowledge.
57.
The “jury is still out” on whether the complexities of a multi-sector project are justified by a
wider array of benefits, that is to say whether the higher costs of preparing and implementing a
cross-sectoral project will be justified by the outcomes. The prospective outcomes for the health and
labor market components of the IHDP are certainly less sure than those for education. It has proved
more difficult to maintain the interest and attention of ministries with relatively small components in
the project, such as for health and employment. Policy dialogue with these two ministries is still
limited.
58.
The Bank’s influence is most apparent in sectors where it has been working for many years.
Education is the most obvious success story. It is also significant that the government of the Maldives
returned to the Bank, after the tsunami, asking for additional advice with respect to the development of
a rapidly changing fisheries industry. This is another sector with which the Bank has a long history. It
was the subject of the Bank’s first lending operation in 1979.
59.

Quality and appropriateness of non-lending activities. The implemented program was fully
consistent with the 2000 CAS, as well as addressing some of the concerns raised by the OED’s
previous evaluation of the country program, such as the criticism that the Bank had not done enough to
foster private sector development, particularly in the fishing industry.

60.

The Bank was flexible while implementing its program of assistance. It adjusted its program
of AAA activities so as to respond to the needs of government, within the overall framework of the
2000 CAS. The investment climate study, the social security study and additional fisheries studies
were all “add-ons”, but all served to reinforce the objectives of the CAS. The activities of IFC within
the financial sector were also important additional and influential activities.

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 16 of 27

61.
The technical assistance provided has had strong government ownership and as a result
completed activities have generally been influential. The most successful activities have been
implemented with a high level of direct involvement on the part of key government counterparts as
well as strong and direct involvement by Bank Group staff. However, the implementation of
government-managed TA activities has always been much slower than expected due to the lack of
mid-level capacity in all agencies.
62.
Linkages with other donors. Following the tsunami, the bank Group’s developed stronger
links with many other donors in part because it had a representative in Male’. In particular, sharing
an office with the ADB in Male’ made a significant difference. In addition, the Bank’s Special
Representative’s attendance at meetings of the UN Country Team also proved very beneficial. As a
result, it has been possible to more closely dovetail our activities so as to avoid overlaps and
misunderstandings. Also, the government has recently established the Maldives Partnership Forum,
with a view to developing stronger long-term relationships between all active donors and the
government. These meetings were designed as a vehicle for exchanging information and discussion
and not as venues for providing funding pledges. It has met twice in 2006 and 2007.
63.
Overall Assessment of Operational Performance. IDA’s performance is judged to have
been satisfactory. The CAS was well conceived, focused on areas of great importance for the
government, which resulted in high government ownership of the program. The Maldives country
team delivered more than promised by the CAS. For example, at the request of the government, it
added several important advisory activities, including the recently completed fisheries study and the
pensions and social security study. These studies were very well managed with extensive inputs from
Bank staff and consultants, even as government remained in the “driver’s seat” for both. Also, the
Bank’s response to the tsunami disaster was prompt and effective, while seeking to augment and not
diminish the role of government as the coordinator of reconstruction efforts.
64.

Greater attention during supervision would have been useful, particularly when the capacity
deficiencies in the implementing agencies were too often apparent. The implementation of some
activities was delayed beyond what might have been acceptable before additional pressure was applied
by Bank staff to jump-start or restart the activity. Additionally, while the delivered CAS program was
very appropriate, the CAS program matrix suggested an area of interest that was too expansive in its
coverage. The matrix included areas of possible involvement for which no significant activities were
proposed; including health and the environment. This made the preparation of this assessment
document more difficult than it should have been. Greater focus would have been desirable. A quality
at entry review by QAG resulted in a similar criticism about the IHDP project, suggesting that it was
not adequately focused. Subsequently, small adjustments were made to the project design to address
this concern.

65.

With respect to outcomes, our client’s overall performance has been satisfactory. Education
outcomes have exceeded expectations, while there have been important improvements in the
investment climate for private businesses. Also, government is currently much more serious about its
fiduciary management functions. The area of sub-standard performance has been its inability to plan
and restrain spending.

66.
With respect to the implementation of Bank Group activities, the client’s performance was
also judged to be fully satisfactory in two OED/IEG reports.
a.

OED undertook a project performance assessment report of the first two education and
training projects and rated them as follows: Outcome—highly satisfactory, institutional

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 17 of 27

b.

development—substantial, sustainability—likely, and borrower performance—highly
satisfactory.
IEG recently rated the Third Education and Training project as satisfactory against all
dimensions, with only moderate risks to the development outcome.

67.
However, capacity deficiencies are currently very common in most agencies. This has led to
significant delays in the implementation of both projects and AAA activities. These problems are
threatening the satisfactory rating. Furthermore, the government’s current inability to prioritize the
use of its funds is worrying and likely to add to this problem. Too many projects and activities being
implemented at the same time are also generating budgetary overhangs, which are likely to
overshadow budget planning process for years to come.
V.

LESSONS FOR THE NEW CAS

68.
The Maldives has continued to develop rapidly, despite the shock of the tsunami. However,
many development challenges remain that can usefully be addressed in the new CAS. As the Bank
considers and debates how it can help the country in the next four years, it should consider the
following lessons from the past:
69.
The Bank made a difference because it was selective, with a program designed in close
consultation with government. The Bank Group’s program is small compared with the size of the
economy. However, the chosen areas of focus identified in the CAS were appropriate and had strong
government ownership. The Bank has continued to work with the government on macroeconomic and
fiscal management issues, and it was and is the only donor putting substantial resources into the
improvement of secondary and tertiary education services. The Bank has also taken the lead with
efforts to help the government strengthen procurement, financial management and audit services.
Meanwhile, IFC has been providing important assistance to strengthen and develop new financial
institutions, including the Maldives Leasing Company and the Housing Development and Finance
Corporation.
70.
The Bank Group needs to remain flexible in a small middle-income country. The tsunami
was an exceptional example or how important it is to remain flexible. However, even at a more routine
level, over the last six years the Bank Group has also demonstrated considerable flexibility with
respect to the design and implementation of activities, particular advisory services. For example, the
influential reports on the investment climate, social security reform, fisheries, and IFC’s activities in
the financial sector all demonstrate all demonstrate our willingness to work with Government on
emerging issues of importance to the country. Demonstrated willingness to add to the core program,
within the overall framework defined by the CAS, has allowed the Bank Group to remain more
relevant.
71.
The objectives of the new strategy should be tightly focused, with a monitoring and
evaluation framework that is both realistic and cost-effective. As is evident when reading this report,
it has often been difficult to assess the impact of the Bank’s interventions. This underlines the
importance and challenge of defining realistic CAS objectives, that the Bank Group can influence, and
sets of indicators that the clients can afford to collect. Given the high cost of collecting data, it is
highly desirable to define realistic sets of indicators that measure both project and sector or country
performance. Asking clients to collect special data sets for every donor intervention is certainly
unaffordable and uneconomic.

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 18 of 27

72.
The capacity of government to deliver an increasingly sophisticated range of services
remains a major issue. As the Maldives continues to develop rapidly and approaches middle-income
status, the expectations of its citizens can only increase. The public is demanding ever more
sophisticated services, and the government is expected to deliver them. However, even though close
to a third of all employees work for the government, all ministries are short of skilled mid-level
personnel. Furthermore, there is a long list of overdue administrative and legal reforms. Over the next
few years, donors must support the government’s efforts to create a stronger and more professional
civil service. Institutional and governance reforms will remain a central focus for the Bank Group and
all other donors for the foreseeable future.
73.

Opening a local office has improved communications with our clients, allowed the Bank
Group to be more responsive to the government’s demands, reinforced our dialogue with key agencies,
facilitated project implementation, and promoted stronger donor cooperation.

Attachment C: Description of World Bank Supported Activities
World Bank Lending

1.
The Third Education and Training Project was approved in March 2000 (under the
umbrella of the earlier 1995 CAS) for a loan amount of $17.6 million. It is describer here because of
its significance within the portfolio. The project recently closed and an ICR has been prepared.
Overall, it was rated as a satisfactory project against all dimensions. This was the third in a series of
similar and successful projects. Each provided assistance to improve the quality and coverage of
secondary education, strengthen and expand teacher training, and provide overseas fellowships for
well qualified school leavers who had acquired the necessary qualifications to enter overseas
universities and colleges. Results from the recent ICR mission, and the IEG review of the ICR,
confirm that access to secondary and tertiary education has improved significantly. However, some
questions remain about the quality of education. Concern was also expressed about the sustainability
of existing programs given their high cost. For example, government has continued to expand
secondary education on many more islands than it had been intended when the project prepared and
also assumed responsibility for all community primary schools.
2.
The Integrated Human Development Project was approved immediately prior to the
tsunami, in September 2004, for a loan amount of approximately $16 million. It was provided for in
the 2000 CAS. It is an ambitious multi-sectoral project covering education, health and social
protection (access to labor markets), that was designed to strengthen social services on focus islands
where the population is expected to increase in the future years. Soon after its approval, and following
advice from QAG, the Bank and the government agreed some minor adjustments to simplify the
project structure. Further, the understandable focus of government on reconstruction activities
seriously impacted the early stages of implementation for this project, although implementation is now
assessed to be fully satisfactory. A mid-term review will be undertaken early next year. However, it is
the education component is likely to have a greatest impact, as it builds on the foundations created by
past Bank funded projects.
3.

The Post Tsunami Emergency Relief and Reconstruction Project was approved by the
Board on March 15 2005 and signed two days later, for a loan amount of $14.1 million. This loan
helped finance cash grants to affected persons, the reconstruction of schools and some technical
assistance. A year later, the EU added additional funds equivalent to $17 million to the project to
finance an improved public accounting system (to be used initially to manage the tsunami
reconstruction funds) school reconstruction activities, health facilities and a solid waste management
component.
AAA Activities

4.
Pension and Social Security report. This report was completed in 2005. It was not listed as
an output in the CAS. However, given the recommendation promoting programmatic interventions for
the social sectors it was a logical additional output. The study had consistently strong government
ownership and support. The government has immediate plans to implement its recommendation with
respect to pensions. The Bank team continues to work very closely and collaboratively with
government on the follow-up to this report and it is likely that there will be a Bank funded Pension
project in FY09.

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report

5.
Budget and expenditure planning. In close consultation with the IMF and the ADB, the
Bank has continued to play an important role as an advisor on management of the economy. The
public expenditure report of 2002 and a County Economic Update (completed in 2004) were the only
formal pieces of economic sector work completed during this six-year period. Much of the influence
the Bank has had was largely due to the relatively frequent visits by members of our economic team,
their willingness to “roll up their sleeves” and work directly with their counterparts in government.
6.
At the technical level, there is now a much better understanding of what needs to be done to
manage the economy more effectively, by a large group of mid-level professionals in the government.
Unfortunately, the politicians and decision makers have been less willing to accept the advice of the
Bank on these issues, as well as that of the IMF and the ADB. Since the tsunami, the government has
adopted a highly risky fiscal strategy. This is in direct contrast to the conservative and responsible
fiscal policies that were the norm before the tsunami and at the time the 2000 CAS was prepared.
7.
The CAS envisaged that the government would prepare a separate PRSP. This did not happen.
However, the government has recently completed its 7NDP which is written so that it can also be used
as the country’s PRSP. Bank and IMF staff are currently preparing a Joint Staff Assessment Note for
consideration by the Boards of both institutions.
8.
Strengthening fiduciary management systems. Over the last six years, this has been a major
focus for the World Bank, as envisaged by the CAS. Also, the approval, by the People’s Majlis of the
Public Finance Act early in 2005, dramatically increased the government’s ownership of these issues.
Specifically, the Bank is supporting the development of a Public Accounting System. This activity is
financed through an EU trust funds managed by the Bank, as part of the tsunami reconstruction
activities, with a view to initially using the new systems to manage the reconstruction funds. IDF
funded activities for strengthening the audit and procurement functions are also under-implementation.
9.
A Country Procurement Assessment was not prepared, as envisaged in the CAS. However, the
need to strengthen public procurement is recognized by government and using an IDF grant it is
currently considering how to strengthen this function.
10.

An Investment Climate Assessment was completed in 2005. Its recommendations provide
part of the agenda for the new CAS. The direct involvement of Bank staff and the active participation
and support of government staff and other local counterparts were major factors contributing to the
success of this activity.

11.
Fisheries. Soon after the tsunami the Bank was asked to assist the government with studies to
examine the future of the industry. The resulting studies recently completed (supported also by FAO).
This activity effectively replace the fisheries sector report, under preparation in 2000, and referred to
the 2000 CAS, that was never formally completed because of quality concerns. However, the Bank’s
comparative advantage in the sector continued to be recognized by the government. The recent studies
assisted government with the development of appropriate plans and policies for the industry following
its gradual privatization, beginning in 2000. This activity had high government ownership and was
designed and implemented in very close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
The Bank/FAO funded inputs are being used to prepare a Master Plan for the sector.
12.

Land and housing policy. This advisory activity addressed a major development need for the
Maldives. The land and housing markets are poorly developed and the difficulty of accessing land was
identified as an obstacle to investment by the ICA. It was provided for in the CAS. However, our
efforts were appreciated and the government is currently building on the foundations created by the

ANNEX III: Maldives: CAS Completion Report
Page 26 of 27

Bank funded studies to refine the land law. Meanwhile, IFC is working with government to promote
the privatization of the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), hopefully removing an
additional obstacle to housing development.

13.
In addition, IFC expanded its South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) with a
dedicated program to cover Sri Lanka and the Maldives and has established a framework to provide
support to SMEs with improved access to financial services and an enhanced business enabling
environment. Among other activities, it help established the Maldives Leasing Company, providing
equity and technical assistance, and is working with HDFC with a view to it possible privatization.

Attachment D: Summary of Conclusions from the Country Assistance Evaluation. The
contribution of the Bank prior to 2000

1.
The Bank has been active in the country since 1978. Changes have been very rapid since then.
In 1980 the Maldives was still one of the twenty poorest countries in the world. Today, it is well on its
way to upper middle income status. The Bank’s contribution, prior to 2000 provides the foundations
for its post-2000 Bank program. This program included three fisheries projects, two education and
training programs and an airport expansion project. Non-lending activities were mainly designed to
strengthen macro economic management.
2.

A Country Assistance Evaluation published in early 2001, after the 2000 CAS was approved
by the Bank’s Board, reviewed the Bank’s earlier involvement in the Maldives. Many of its
conclusions are still valid and relevant.

3.
The report concludes that the Bank’s program had been highly appropriate for the Maldives.
However, it notes that we could have done more to promote the development of the private sector and
to help the government protect its natural environment. It was also doubtful about the appropriateness
of some of our later activities in fisheries. There was particular concern that fish processing and
manufacturing was still dominated by the public sector and had not been opened up to the private
sector. The ratings provided in the report are as follows:
4.
Overall impact. Satisfactory, but the evaluators had some concerns about the future of the
fisheries sector. Some of the evaluators’ concerns have since been partly addressed with the partial
privatization of MIFCO and the subsequent expansion of fish processing facilities in the country.
However, the reforms are incomplete and the Bank is currently helping the government with the
preparation of a Fisheries Master Plan.
5.
Institutional Development Impact. Moderate, with concerns about the about the Bank’s
breadth of impact. The issue of institutional capacity is still a key issue for the new CAS to
supplement the efforts of the last five years to strengthen all aspects of fiduciary management, and past
efforts to strengthen the major implementation agencies.
6.
Sustainability. Uncertain, the evaluators underlined their concerns about sustainable impact
of the three previous fisheries projects. They also concerned about the narrow base of the economy. As
noted about the concerns about fisheries have been partially addressed while the concerns about the
narrow base of the economy remain.
7.

The report summarized the challenges for the Maldives as broadening its economic base,
expanding access to social services in the Atolls, developing a sustainable social safety net, and
protecting the countries natural environment. It recommended that the Bank and other donors work
with government to enhance the role of the private sector, establish a more efficient social safety net,
prepare a public expenditure review, and increased focus on the development of stronger
environmental policies.

Page 1 of 6

ANNEX VI: Maldives Public and External Debt Sustainability∗
Debt sustainability analysis indicates a rise in external and public sector vulnerabilities—
underlined by falling international reserves—in the absence of fiscal reforms. The baseline
scenario assumes GDP growth of 3.5-5.5 percent per annum. The alternative scenario, predicated on
fiscal and structural reforms leading to a better investment climate, assumes growth of 6.5-7.5 percent
per annum. While the profile of public sector external debt is identical in nominal terms in the two
scenarios,6 the unstable macroeconomic environment and lower export growth of the baseline scenario
leads to international reserves falling to 1.5 months of imports in the baseline, while external
vulnerabilities are tempered by a buildup of reserves in the alternative scenario.
Public debt sustainability
In the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio continues to accelerate until 2009,
although it declines later into the projection period. Driven mainly by sharp increases in foreign
public debt, overall public debt rises from 51.7 percent in 2006 to 78.3 percent of GDP by 2008.
Domestic fiscal deficits, deriving from the deteriorating fiscal position in 2007 and beyond also
contribute to the rising public debt-to-GDP ratio. While the share of foreign public debt in GDP
reverts to pre-tsunami levels by 2012 in line with official repayment schedules for foreign public debt,
the lingering fiscal deficits over the medium term maintain the level of domestic public debt relatively
constant over the medium term, leading to a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent in 2012—lower
than its peak in 2008-09, but substantially higher than its pre-tsunami levels.
As the stress tests illustrate, the profile of public debt deteriorates further in the face of shocks to
the baseline. The worst public debt-to-GDP ratio of 85 percent is project under the growth shock
scenario, which envisions a permanent one-half standard deviation shock to the assumed growth path
in the baseline. The rest of the shock scenarios, which include shocks to the interest rate, contingent
liabilities, exchange rate, and a combination of the above, also generate significant deterioration in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio.
In the alternative scenario prepared by staff, prudent fiscal policy helps bring public debt-toGDP ratio to pre-tsunami levels. The alternative scenario is built on the assumption that the
domestic financing requirement is kept at zero over the medium term. This implies that domestic
public debt is kept constant in nominal terms during 2006-12. While the profile of foreign public debt
is still governed—as in the baseline scenario—by the official repayment schedules for foreign public
debt, the level of domestic public debt is significantly lower than in the baseline. Consequently, by the
end of the projection period, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declines to 45.3 percent—close to its pretsunami level of 43.1 percent.
External debt sustainability
With unchanged fiscal policies, international reserves fall to very low levels, and the external
debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to climb until 2009. In 2007 and 2008, there is a substantial planned
increase in government borrowing from multilateral and bilateral sources, mainly for infrastructure
projects, including the development of atolls and harbors, electricity generation, airports and sewage
and waste collection systems. In addition to government borrowing, the private sector is assumed to
6
Debt ratios differ across the two scenarios due to differences in nominal GDP. Note that nominal GDP is higher in the
baseline scenario, due to higher inflation

concluded on July 30, 2007.

borrow to finance ambitious resort-development plans. The external debt-to-GDP ratio accordingly
peaks in 2009. After 2009, the pace of resort-building activity is assumed to slow, and with
amortization and a planned reduction in government borrowing, the ratio falls to 68.3 percent in 2012,
slightly above the end-2006 level. However, despite the fall in debt ratios by the end of the projection
period, external vulnerability remain high, as evinced by the fall in international reserves to 1.5
months of imports.
The stress tests illustrate that the debt path is particularly vulnerable to shocks to the current
account and the exchange rate. While in both shock scenarios the debt-to-GDP ratio eventually
declines, a current account shock would cause the ratio to climb above 100 percent from 2008 through
2011, and a real depreciation of 30 percent would cause the ratio to rise sharply to 120 percent in the
year that the depreciation occurred. While both scenarios are unlikely, neither can be ruled out
entirely. A current account shock could occur due to Maldives’ large exposure to tourism patterns and
world commodity prices. A real depreciation could occur if further fiscal slippages and attendant
deficit monetization led to high inflation or if a surge in import demand—generated by excessive
public expenditure—put the peg under pressure.
In the alternative scenario, with domestic expenditures kept in line with a realistic revenue
forecast, international reserves rise to three months of imports. The stable macroeconomic
environment permits more rapid expansion of tourism and fisheries, the mainstay both of exports and
of real GDP. Despite an identical profile for external public debt, the lower current account deficits
permit a rise in international reserves, thereby limiting external vulnerabilities relative to the baseline.
