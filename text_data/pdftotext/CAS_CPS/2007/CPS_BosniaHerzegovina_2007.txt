EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has made remarkable progress in post-conflict reconstruction,
social integrationand state building since the end o f the 1992-95 war. The Dayton Peace Agreement,
signed in 1995, established a complex governance structure comprising the Council of Ministers at
the State-level government and two Entity Governments: the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina
(the Federation) and Republika Srpska (the RS). An autonomous Brcko District was added to the
structure in 1999.
2.
With the continued support o f the international community, the country has taken strides
towards establishing a functioning market economy and making progress towards EU integration.
The BH economy i s stable. Growth has averaged five percent a year since 2000 while inflation has
remained below five percent for most of the decade. Although the most recent data i s scarce, there i s
some evidence of poverty reduction, though rural areas may be lagging. Negotiations with the
European Union (EU) on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) were opened in
November 2005. Technical negotiations were completed, but the S A A has not yet been signed,
mainly due to an impasse on police restructuring.
3.
The World Bank Group has played a significant role in this development story with
commitments totaling more than US$1.1 billion IDA credits and grants since 1996 and nearly
US$250 million original commitments from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and about
US$3 10 million in guarantees from MIGA. This constituted one o f the largest per capita assistance
programs received by any post-conflict country. The vast bulk o f this support came in the
reconstruction phase. A review carried out by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) in 2004 found
the B H reconstruction program to be an example o f “the Bank at its best.”

4.
In spite o f the very substantial progress in physical reconstruction, more than a decade in
transition reforms has been lost to the war and reconstruction efforts. The complex institutional and
political environment allows for concerted political obstruction of many reforms and frequent
political gridlocks, which in turn have impeded rapid advances on economic reform. This has
retarded the development o f a nationwide institutional infrastructure fully supportive o f a market
economy and EU integration.
5.
At the time of the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) - endorsed by the Board in
September 2004 - the World Bank Group and other donors felt considerable optimism that BH was
on the threshold o f a swift and significant transition from a reconstruction mode to a fully-fledged
development partnership: a national medium-term development strategy (MTDS) had been agreed;
discussions with the EU on further integration had begun; and there was some momentum in the
privatization process. Hence, the CAS was centered on Development Policy Lending (DPL)’ in
support o f public sector reform and private sector development. While some important reforms were
achieved during the previous CAS period, with hindsight, it i s clear that the degree o f optimism felt at
the time was unwarranted. There i s now a broad consensus that the key reason for poor
implementation o f the DPL was the lack o f political commitment to reform. However, this was also
compounded by the fact that some World Bank-supported programs were overly complex and
ambitious.

’ Formerly referred to as ‘adjustment lending’
1

6.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to focus on areas of demonstrable
Government commitment and capacity to deliver on development strategies and reforms.
Identifying areas o f intervention that have unconditional ownership by all the Governments and
which also have significant development impact has been, and will continue to be, the key
challenge. The Bank’s portfolio will mostly comprise investment lending and, provided there i s
political commitment in a particular area, very focused DPLs.

A range o f interventions from across the World Bank Group will be used in partnership
7.
with other donors and with communications to create an enabling environment for further reform.
The IFC will seek opportunities to offer debt and equity in support o f B H automotive, metals,
financial and tourism sectors, while also supporting SME development and providing advisory
services; MIGA will be open to support foreign direct investment in B H through the provision o f
political risk guarantees.
On the World Bank side, resources under the base case o f this CPS are programmed to
8.
comprise a mix o f IDA and IBRD financing. BH will begin to use IBRD financing during the first
year o f the CPS. It i s anticipated that the country will graduate from IDA resources at the end of
this CPS period. Project financing will be blended and a total o f approximately US$50 million a
year will be available. Should progress be made towards the high case performance benchmarks,
an incremental US$20 million per annum would be available to BH. A mid-term assessment of the
high case performance benchmarks will be undertaken in late 2009.
Despite strong economic performance and a reasonably healthy portfolio, the level o f risk
in the BH program i s substantial. The greatest internal risks to implementation o f the B H program
are political obstruction o f economic reforms and deterioration in the quality of the political

9.

dialogue. Meanwhile, local and regional political tensions risk distracting policy-makers from the
economic reform program.
10.

Executive Directors may wish to consider:

i) Whether the lessons learned from the previous CAS period have been adequately
reflected in the CPS;

ii)Whether the financial resources, terms and performance benchmarks are appropriately
matched to BH’s level o f development;
iii)Whether the program i s adequately tailored to make the best use of World Bank Group
resources in order to respond to BH’s needs.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Economy and Social Context
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has a complex governance structure. Since the Dayton
1.
Peace Agreement was signed in 1995, peace has been maintained in BH and the country has achieved
remarkable progress in reconstruction and economic development. The Dayton Peace Agreement
established a complex governance structure comprising the Council o f Ministers at the State-level
Government and two Entity Governments: the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina (the
Federation) and Republika Srpska (the RS). An autonomous Brcko District was added to the
structure in 1999. The Federation i s divided into ten cantons and 74 municipalities. The Republika
Srpska i s divided into 63 municipalities (see Box 1).

The complex institutional structure permits concerted political obstruction of reforms
2.
and frequent political gridlocks which, in turn, have impeded rapid advances in economic
reforms. Despite progress in creating new State-level institutions after 1995, opposing views on
the role of the State in BH, combined with attempts to preserve as high a degree as possible o f
Entity autonomy, has retarded the development o f a nationwide institutional infrastructure fully
supportive o f a market economy and EU integration. A single economic space and a common
vision o f the country as a framework for guiding economic policy-making have been slow to
emerge: it was only in 2004 that the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), the first
nationwide, locally conceived document o f its kind, was adopted.
There i s still a significant international presence in BH. BH operates under the
3.
supervision o f a High RepresentativeEU Special Representative to BH, supported by the Office o f
the High Representative ( O m ) . This position was created to oversee implementation o f the civilian

3

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO&FYll

aspects o f the Dayton Peace Agreement and it carries extensive powers to legislate and remove public
officials. The High Representative i s supervised by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC),
comprising representatives o f countries and agencies that support the peace process in different
ways. A contingent o f EUFOR troops continues to oversee the security situation, and while concerns
over personal security have greatly diminished, societal divisions persist. During the national
elections in 2006 nationalistrhetoric increased, further compounding the reform gridlock.

4.
Negotiations with the EU on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) were
opened in 2005; the technical negotiations have been completed, but the Agreement has not yet
been signed. The SAA has been held back mainly by a lack o f agreement on police restructuring, the
last remaining major benchmark to be met (although reform o f public broadcasting and full
cooperation with the ICTY are also needed for the signing o f the SAA, see Annex 5). The October
2007 PIC concluded that the lack o f progress with the SAA-required reforms i s a grave
disappointment and a source o f concern for the international community. However, they welcomed
the Mostar Declaration* of October 28, 2007 as a starting point for a positive reengagement o f the
government coalition parties.
5.
Joining the EU remains a key goal for BH, but governance reform is needed.
Accelerating the EU integrationprocess - something public opinion polls indicate the majority o f the
population supports - would require a renewed government willingness to address problem areas,
including vested interests that reap benefits from the rigidities and complexities o f the multilayered
government structure. An attempt to reform the constitution in April 2006 was not successful. The
fragile consensus for reform broke down between those who prefer incremental changes to the status
quo, no matter how modest, and those who prefer a more radical restructuring. The prospects for a
new constitutional agreement are uncertain in the current political climate.

6.

I n addition to internal factors, the political climate in BH during the past year has
been affected by regional developments. Discussion o f the potential links between the resolution
of the status o f Kosovo and o f the integrity of BH as a sovereign nation has had a negative effect
on the political environment in B H and has increased opposition to strengthening o f State-level
institutions. Calls have been made in the RS for a referendum on self-determination.

7.
However, even in the current environment, progress on key reforms i s possible and
necessary. The October 2007 signing of a Platform for Action (Annex 1) on key structural reforms
that could help boost BH economy’s potential i s encouraging. The Platform for Action aims at
accelerating the implementation o f urgent reforms to attract investment, accelerate job creation and
improve living standards in the country. The signatories agreed that urgent economic reform
cannot be put on hold until major political disputes are resolved. I t supports actions to: (i)improve
fiscal coordination and stability; (ii)create a more conducive business environment; and, (iii)
promote other reforms that ensure sustainable development. A successful and swift implementation
o f these commitments would be in the interest o f all B H citizens.

On October 28, 2007, the leaders of the six main parties met in Mostar and agreed on the general principles that could support a
positive move forward on the pending S A A agenda

B. Recent Economic Developments and Outstanding Challenges

Output, inflation and employment

8.
BH has made substantial progress in economic reconstruction since the end of the war
and economic expansion has remained robust. Driven in large part by a jump in international
metal prices, earlier reforms, new metal-processing capacity and significant remittance inflows,
economic expansion has remained robust over the last few years. Real GDP growth, which has
averaged five percent a year since 2000 i s likely to rise to about six percent in 2007, helping return
the level o f GDP to near its pre-war leveL3 A lot more remains to be done, however, to create
conditions for sustained growth and to reduce risks to hard-won fiscal stability.
9.
Inflation has remained low in general. Anchored in the currency board arrangement,
inflation i s set to average two percent in 2007, after a one-off surge to 7.5 percent in 2006 as a
consequence o f the introduction o f the Value Added Tax (VAT).
10.
Formal employment i s low, but i s now rising. After several years o f labor shedding,
hiring has increased and overall employment i s reported to have risen five percent in 2006.
Unemployment has eased to 29 percent in early 2007 from 3 1 percent in 2006. Sustained
improvements in employment will require structural changes in the pattern o f productive activity.
External developments

11.
The current account deficit remains large and represents a key macroeconomic
challenge, despite evidence that the shortfall i s smaller than officially estimated. The officially
estimated current account deficit narrowed from about 20 percent of GDP in 2005 to 10.7 percent
o f GDP in 2006 due to across-the-board export growth and improved statistical reporting.
Preliminary data suggest that the external shortfall i s set to widen again in 2007 to as much as
17 percent o f GDP. However, there i s substantial evidence that the current account deficit may be
much smaller than i s officially estimated due to the underestimation of remittance inflows and
other current transfers.

12.
Net capital inflows have consistently exceeded the current account deficit, boosting
foreign exchange reserves. Reserves rose to US$3.5 billion as o f the end of September 2007 (or
5.2 months’ worth o f import cover). Foreign direct investment inflows also rose to about
11 percent o f GDP in 2007, reflecting substantial progress on privatization in the RS.
13.
BH’s gross external debt fell from 60.3 percent o f GDP in 2003 to about 50 percent o f
GDP in late 2007, thanks to a rapid reduction in public external indebtedness. Public external
debt amounted to just below one-half of total external debt and i s dominated by obligations to
multilateral and bilateral creditors. The World Bank i s the country’s largest single creditor with
outstanding debt balance o f US$1.4 billion as of the end o f June 2007 - equivalent to 10.3 percent
o f GDP. BH’s World Bank debt accounted for about 20.5 percent o f the country’s overall external
debt. More than one-half o f BH’s external debt i s denominated in Euros and about one-half o f
external debt i s contracted at floating interest rates, resulting in substantial exposure to changing
global market conditions.

The statistics agency has revised national accounts data to reflect some o f the sizable non-observed economy (NOE), bringing B H in
line with most other countries in the region. As a result o f adjustments in 2005 and 2006, nominal GDP i s now larger by about 17
percent. Third-party estimates o f the NOE in B H suggest that it may be as large as 40-50 percent o f GDP.

Progress in fiscal consolidation has been substantial since the fiscal deficit peaked in
1999, but Government spending i s still high. The general government deficit was reduced from
about six percent in 1999 to two percent in 2004, before shifting to a surplus o f about three percent
in 2006. Through mid-2007, the general government surplus amounted to about four percent o f

6

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYObFYII

GDP. Budget revisions in both Entities should bring the general government outcome to near
balance for 2007 as a whole. Fiscal consolidation since 1999 has been accompanied by a reduction
in the size o f government, with general government spending down from about 5 1 percent o f GDP
in 2003 to about 44percent in 2006. Nonetheless, the government burden on the economy
expressed as a percentage o f GDP i s 4-5 percent higher than that of countries with similar levels of
per capita income.

15.
Government debt i s low, amounting to about 20 percent of GDP in late 2007, down
from about 24 percent in 2004. Even after the planned issuance of government bonds to finance
the settlement of domestic claims, government debt should remain limited to about 42 percent of
GDP by 201 1 and be substantially lower in Net Present Value (NPV) terms (about 35 percent o f
GDP)4reflecting the fact that the newly issued debt will be highly concessional, as i s a substantial
share o f the existing government obligations.

Some structural reform has been undertaken in BH. Reforms o f the financial sector,
trade policy and public finance have advanced reasonably well. In public finance, key
accomplishments to date include successful harmonization o f indirect taxation, culminating in the
establishment o f the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) at the beginning o f 2004 and the introduction o f
a state-wide single-rate VAT from the start of 2006. Modernized and harmonized corporate
income tax (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) laws were enacted in 2006 in the RS and in late
2007 in the Federation, setting the respective CIT rate at 10 percent and the PIT rates at 10 percent
and 15 percent, a major improvement over previous legislation.
17.
However, implementation of other key reforms has been slow and uneven. The
National Fiscal Council (NFC), comprising the presiding member of the B H Council o f Ministers
and the two Entity Prime Ministers, was formally established in 2005; a draft law was recently
agreed after substantial delays. However, the NFC i s not yet functional. Enacting the law will be a
crucial step toward ensuring effective coordination of the setting, executing and monitoring o f
fiscal policy in BH. Progress in advancing non-bank privatization and other corporate restructuring
has also been slow, particularly in the Federation.
C. Poverty Profile

18.
About 18 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the most recent data
available.' About 80 percent o f the poor live in rural areas and many of the poor are in large
households. The heads of poor households tend to be among the least educated and are typically
inactive or unemployed. The overall poverty numbers conceal movements into and out of poverty
and differences in the evolution o f poverty rates at disaggregated levels. The poverty headcount
was reduced only slightly between 2001 and 2004, although many individuals moved both into and
out of poverty. These movements reflect outcomes in the labor market and wage developments.
Many workers who moved out o f poverty also moved from inactivity or unemployment into
employment.

' These domestic claims were accumulated as a result of the 1992-95 war and the fiscal pressures in its wake. The claims are composed
of three groups: government spending arrears (almost fully repaid), liabilities for frozen currency deposits and liabilities for war
damages. After settling in cash a small portion o f the deposits upon verification, the authorities plan to settle the remaining claims for
such deposits by issuing bonds in 2008 with maturity o f nine years and a fixed interest rate of 2.5 percent. The claims for war claims are
planned to be settled with bonds with longer-tern to be issued in 2009. Current legislation in the RS allows for maturities up to 35
years, grace period o f 25 years and an interest rate of I.5 percent. In the Federation, the grace period i s 13 years and the interest rate 1.5
percent
The most recent data on poverty i s from the 2004 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS).

19.
Many households remain vulnerable to the risk of falling into poverty, or are “nearly
poor.”6 Among those who moved out of poverty between 2001 and 2004, about 70 percent may be
considered “nearly poor” and vulnerable to falling back into poverty.
20.
Employment remains a key determinant of poverty. The 2006 Labor Force Survey
suggests that informality i s associated with lower average (and more unequal) earnings. In addition,
joblessness i s associated with worse welfare outcomes. Among working-age individuals, those who
are jobless account for the largest share of the poor and face the highest poverty risks. Joblessness
i s the highest among the young, women, the relatively less educated workers and workers over 40
years of age. Qualitative research suggests that subsistence agriculture and remittances from
abroad continue to play a role in many rural households’ coping strategies.
21.
While gender equality and women’s rights are included in law, the situation o f women
in BH remains of concern. In rural areas, traditional gender roles have resulted in limited access
for women to productive resources, such as land. Employment remains difficult and women’s
participation in the labor market continues to be low compared with men. Many women are not
covered by health insurance. Provisions to guarantee women equal pay are in place but they are not
consistently applied. Women continue to be under-represented in politics and official authorities7.
22.
There are 17 officially recognized minorities in BH, but the law on the Protection of
Ethnic Minorities continues to be poorly applied. The Roma continue to be the most vulnerable
minority and discrimination against this community persists, with problems in access to housing,
social services, education and employment’.

23.
The Bank’s understanding of poverty and well-being after 2004 is constrained by the
lack of data. Information on household consumption was collected during the 2001 and 2004
Living Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS). For 2004, data on household expenditure i s also
available from the Household Budget Survey (HBS). Data from the latest HBS (2007) will be
available only in 2008. Further, all survey data collection efforts are constrained by the lack of a
recent population census. The most recent census was taken in 1991 and a new one i s urgently
needed. The government i s considering launching preparation for a new census in the near future.
24.
Though still substantial, it i s likely that poverty has fallen since 2004. Data that
supports such an inference includes: strong real GDP growth, robust increases in real wages and
pensions, and a robust increase in employment of late. Moreover, informality appears to have been
reduced following the introduction of the VAT and helped by robust lending by foreign-owned
banks.

25.

The Bank will continue to support B H in its efforts to achieve the MDGs. The

statistics that measure BH’s progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have
not been updated since 2005, although the picture can be supplemented from other data sources
(see Annex 8). The data available shows a positive trend across measured MDG indicators. I t also
shows that B H i s well advanced towards meeting the MDG goals. The Bank will focus i t s
interventions on the reduction of poverty, which i s s t i l l the largest problem area for BH in relation
to the MDGs. As poverty in BH i s strongly correlated with lack of employment, the Bank’s focus
i s on poverty elimination through economic growth and job creation. Finally, the Bank will

continue to advocate improvements in means-testing o f social programs to help reduce poverty
through increased efficiency of government spending.

D. Medium Term Outlook

26.
The ‘baseline’ case scenario over the CPS period assumes only modestly ambitious
structural and fiscal reforms and slower growth. BH could achieve sustained strong growth in
output and employment over the medium term provided key reforms are advanced further and
vulnerabilities are tackled. However if, as anticipated, reforms proceed at a more modest pace,
consistent with recent experience, growth will ultimately slow down from the robust pace observed
in 2006 and 2007. The ‘baseline’ scenario assumes only modestly ambitious structural and fiscal
reforms, continued adherence to the currency board arrangement and improvements in regional
stability.
27.
Real GDP growth i s projected to accelerate to 6.5 percent in 2008, but slow thereafter
(Table 1). GDP growth i s expected to rise briefly as substantial new metal processing capacity i s
introduced and as a result of structural reforms carried out earlier. After 2008, growth i s projected
to ease to about 4-4.5 percent a year by 2010 and 201 1 - under the assumption of modest reform
efforts. The longer-term growth rate under the baseline case scenario reflects continued increases
in employment at the rate of 2 percent a year, slower than in recent years. Consumer price inflation
i s assumed to average about 2 percent in 2007, thanks to the currency board arrangement.

28.
The current account deficit i s expected to remain large and continue to represent an
important vulnerability. After rising to about 17 percent of GDP in 2007, the officially-estimated
current account deficit i s projected to narrow to about 13 percent of GDP by the end of the CPS
period. Inflows of foreign direct investment are expected to peak at about 11 percent of GDP in
2007 and 2008, reflecting privatization receipts and, thereafter, average about 5 percent a year.
Inflows of foreign direct investment and capital grants (included in the capital and financial
account, and not in the current account) should finance more than one half of the deficit. These
inflows, together with continued reflows of resident capital should help limit reliance on foreign
borrowing.
The general government balance i s assumed to shift from equilibrium in 2007 to a
29.
modest deficit of about 2 percent of GDP by the end o f the CPS period, reflecting a decline in
grants and a growth in expenditures. Capital expenditures are set to rise in line with government
plans to boost infrastructure outlays but these will be constrained by the ability to secure financing.
Over the CPS period, it i s projected that the fiscal deficit will be financed largely through net
domestic borrowing, draw-downs of government deposits and privatization receipts. Privatization
receipts are projected to amount to about EUR 1 billion in 2008 (about 8.7 percent of GDP),
assuming enterprise sales in the Federationproceed as plannedg.

30.
The baseline scenario assumes a fiscally responsible resolution of the large amount o f
domestic claims, reflecting substantial efforts made to date. Domestic claims have an estimated
face value of about 16 percent of 2007 GDP. The current size of domestic claims compares well
with much larger estimates from 2004. Some of these estimates amounted to as much as 200
percent of GDP, reflecting lack of clarity about many of the claims. In addition to these claims, the
authorities will need to tackle property restitution. The amount of restitution claims i s substantial,
and the authorities are working on a comprehensive strategy for dealing with property restitution.
Nonetheless, risks remain that political pressures will lead to a fiscally unaffordable settlement.
Significant revenues from privatization were received in Republika Srpska during 2007

31.
Pre-war arrears amounting to EUR 48.8 million at the end o f October 2007, owed to
the I F C by two government-owned companies, have been transferred to the B H authorities.
Resolution o f these arrears has been elusive for some years. The authorities have recently agreed
to renew and advance their discussions with the IFC on ways to resolve this issue in a manner
agreeable to both parties. I t i s fully expected that B H will make progress on this expeditiously.
E. External Financing Requirements
32.
The external debt burden i s projected to ease moderately under the baseline scenario,
but the debt service will worsen after the CPS period as external financing shifts further to
non-concessional sources. The face value o f external debt i s projected to remain close to, but
below, 50 percent o f GDP throughout the CPS period. The Net Present Value (NPV) of external
debt i s set to fall from 47 percent in 2005 to about 40 percent by 2008, but rise thereafter to about
43 percent by 201 1, as borrowing on concessional terms falls sharply. Debt service ratios are
projected to improve through 20 10 before worsening thereafter, as the share o f concessional debt i s
reduced.
33.
Financing requirements are projected to decline as a percentage of GDP over the CPS
period, but rise modestly thereafter. The evolution o f financing requirements reflects the
narrowing of the current account deficit and the assumed shift in foreign borrowing from
concessional to market terms (Table 2)." The balance of payments projections imply that financing
requirements will ease from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2006 to 11.5 percent by 2012 but rise modestly
to 12.2% by 2016, reflecting the shift in foreign borrowing from concessional to market terms.

F. Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Assessment
34.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has established, but generally not implemented, modern
public financial management institutions and systems. The State and both Entities have laid the
foundation for sound public financial management, including independent external audits. The
reforms have been characterized by growing domestic ownership, particularly the finance
ministries' efforts to improve the planning and execution of government budgets. However, many
o f the improvements that have been enshrined in laws and institutional arrangements still need to
be implemented in practice.
35.
Fiscal policy remains fragmented between the State, the two Entities and Brcko
District. While agreement has been reached recently on a law that sets the stage for fiscal
coordination, the law has not yet been implemented. A functional, intergovernmental National
Fiscal Council (NFC) that can make timely and binding decisions on fiscal policy will be critical to
overcoming the current fragmentation o f fiscal policy-making. The creation of a unified indirect
taxation system i s a positive development, despite disagreements over the revenue-sharing formula
between the Entities and Brcko District.

36.
Strategic planning and budgeting has improved and ownership i s more evident. I t i s
hoped that the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) can be sustained without external
support and there are indications that it i s becoming the starting point for preparation o f annual
budgets. Preliminary steps have been taken toward a program-based budgeting process.
Significant institutional reforms have been introduced by the State and Entity governments to
improve organic budget laws. In addition, an intergovernmental Budget Coordination Board has
InFinancing requirements are defined as the sum of the current account deficit including both current and capital transfers, principal
repayments due and the change in foreign exchange reserves.

10

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FY08-FYI1

been formed for coordinating medium-term budget development among the governments including
aligning macro-fiscal assumptions.

37.
An automated treasury system at the State level and in the two Entities has improved
budget controls, but does not include extra-budgetary funds. The treasury system has
improved controls, brought discipline to the budget execution system, improved overall cash
management and improved the availability and quality of financial reporting. It i s important that
extra-budgetary funds (particularly health insurance and pension funds) and municipalities are also
brought into the treasury system, because these bodies manage significant resources.
38.
A country-wide Law on Public Procurement (LPP) came into force in January 2005,
but is not being implemented consistently. The new law i s in line with EU requirements and if
implemented, would provide the basis for the Bank to use the country's own procurement systems.
However, it i s not yet being consistently and effectively implemented at the State or Entity levels.
The Supreme Audit Institution of the State has reported several instances o f violation o f the LPP in
i t s respective audit reports. For these reasons, the LPP i s not yet acceptable for use under World
Bank-financed projects. However, improvements in implementation of the law are supported by
various donors and monitored closely by the country fiduciary team.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND ISSUES
A. Country Priorities

39.
The B H authorities’ MTDS for 2004-2007 had three goals: a) create the conditions for
sustainable and balanced economic development and restore partial creditworthiness on the
international capital markets; b) reduce poverty by 20 percent, and c) accelerate E U
integration. The strategy emphasized the inter-relationship between these objectives and aimed to
transition BH from a largely aid-dependent economy to one that i s self-sustaining. A mid-term
progress report and revised strategy was approved in September 2006. The Revised MTDS retained
the three main goals of the original strategy, but introducedgreater prioritization of measures with the
intention of improving implementation.
40.
The MTDS presented a bold reform agenda, but was not fully implemented. Legislation
in the Entities has, at times, run counter to the strategic goals set out in the MTDS, raising questions
about the full political ownership of the main tenets of the strategy. Further, the MTDS was never
fully linked to annual budgets, the MTEF or Public Investment Plans (PIP).

41.

A new Country Development Strategy for the period 2008-13 i s currently under
preparation in BH.
The process i s being led by the Coordination Board for Economic
Development and EU Integration, but i s currently s t i l l in i t s early stages and may not be completed
until late 2008. Early indications suggest that the three overarchingpolicy goals will remain the same
as those in the MTDS.

42.
I n the meantime, the Bank’s team has been in close and regular discussion with the B H
authorities on their priorities. Shortly after the October 2006 elections, the Bank prepared a series
of Policy Notes for the incoming Governments outlining: the Bank’s assessment of progress in
reconstruction and development, remaining challenges and areas of vulnerability and, policy
recommendations covering 10 key sectors.
43.
The dialogue with the Government on the Policy Notes and the Entity Governments’
investment programs was used as a vehicle for expressions of interest in future World Bank
support. The Bank was requested to put an increased focus on investment projects. Priority sectors
highlighted for investments were: infrastructure (especially transport and energy); agriculture;
development of small and medium size enterprises; and, corporate restructuring of enterprises. Other
priority areas emphasized include strengthening of the single economic space in BH, increasing
employment, development of local government, restructuring the economy, improving the
management of loss-makingcompanies and harmonizationwith European legislation.
44.
I n October 2007, the State and Entity Governments, as well as the Mayor of Brcko
District, identified their economic policy reform priorities with the signing of a Platform for
Action (see Annex 1). The proposed CPS program i s closely attuned to these priorities.
B. Sectoral Issues
Business Environment

45.
Some progress has been made in improving the business climate, but B H lags behind
its regional neighbors. Progress through the last CAS period includes facilitating access to
finance and strengthening the legal framework for non-banking financial institutions, improving
the efficiency and effectiveness of the business inspection regime and introducing a new business

12

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FYll

registration system. However, the degree of private sector activity i s below regional averages and
accounts for only about 55 percent o f GDP. The World Bank’s Doing Business reports show that
BH’s relative ranking in terms o f ease o f doing business has been falling”. Creating an investorfriendly business environment will be the key for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and
strengthening growth. A Strategy and Action Plan to enhance corporate financial reporting in line
with the EU standards and international good practice has been approved and now needs to be
implemented.

46.
Several obstacles to an attractive investment climate remain. Key challenges include:
reducing the time it takes to register a new business; improving the corporate sector’s financial
reporting, auditing and accounting standards; reviewing and rationalizing the different taxes and
levies imposed on businesses by various levels o f government; integrating banking supervision (the
Bank recommends full unification at the national level); and, reducing the regulatory burden on
businesses. Stronger and better regulated capital markets and better corporate governance are also
needed.
Infrastructure

47.
Infrastructure improvements are critically needed: transport and energy have been
singled out as key priorities for BH by the authorities. The stock o f infrastructure in BH,
outdated at the time it became a sovereign country, was extensively damaged during the war. Postwar reconstruction was, to a large extent, focused on restoring electricity generating capacities,
roads, schools, bridges and other key infrastructure. The authorities have identified improvements
in infrastructure and movement towards EU standards as high priority areas where the Bank can
provide significant support. Two key sub-sectors have been singled out - transport and energy.
Transport

48.
Demand for most modes of transport i s growing rapidly, consistent with GDP growth.
Road traffic in and around the major urban areas i s currently rising by five percent a year,
increasing congestion and pollution while worsening road safety. On the railways, heavy freight
volumes are projected to increase markedly through the medium term, but passenger volumes are
broadly static. Growth projections on the inland water transport system are modest and dependent
on investment to return the system to navigability.

49.
Transport networks need to be rehabilitated and extended, supported by a national
transport strategy and backed by private financing. About 40 percent o f the main and regional
road networks remain in poor condition and the current allocation for maintenance remains
inadequate. The development of Corridor Vc (part o f the Trans-European Network) i s considered a
national priority and the authorities have begun to implement key sections of the project. The Bank
believes that a National Policy and Strategy for transport i s needed to ensure that investments are
made with regard for the fiscal envelope. Given the scale o f the project and fiscal constraints,
private sector capital will be required in some form o f public-private partnership (PPP), requiring
prior improvements in the institutional framework.
Energy
50.
Power sector rehabilitation i s partially complete, but needs further investment. BH’s
power facilities have largely been restored since the end o f the war and the power sector i s being

restructured to reduce the outstanding inefficiencies and to comply with EU regulations (designed
” Doing Business 2008-BH ranks 105’ in the 178-country Ease o f Doing Business global rating. In Doing Business 2007 BH’s rating
was 95/105 countries.

13

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI1

to promote a unified, competitive, regional electricity market based on free and equal access to all
participants). Nevertheless, there are s t i l l some power system facilities damaged during the war
that have yet to be rehabilitated and the authorities project continuing large investment needs
because o f aging facilities. B H i s part o f the South East Europe Energy Community.

51.
Investment in new power facilities i s needed, supported by a national energy sector
strategy and backed by private financing. There have been no significant investments in new
power system facilities in B H since the war. The authorities recognize that the investments needed
to harness the substantial and relatively diversified energy resource base in BH to expand power
generation capacity to meet growing domestic and regional demand may be larger than can be
covered with traditional donor-financed projects. Recognizing fiscal constraints, the authorities
have launched a comprehensive energy sector study at the State level to inform the preparation of a
BH energy sector strategy (expected completion in December 2007). The Entities have also begun
to explore avenues for spreading risk and limiting fiscal costs through private sector participation.
Although recent initiatives have involved some studies and a competitive process (primarily for
some hydro-power plants), several initiatives are linked to unsolicited proposals from the private
sector.
Service Delivery

52.
Service delivery is poor, especially in rural areas. Responsibility for service delivery lies
with municipalities in BH. Having achieved a great deal in terms of reintegrating returnees and
internally displaced persons following the war, municipalities must now focus on service delivery.
Almost 1.4 million people in B H do not have running water in their household and lack regular
waste removal services. H a l f a million people lack any sanitation service. One third o f rural
households use water from unsafe water sources because they lack water connections.

53.
BH must simultaneously reduce high public expenditure and increase the quality and
quantity o f public services. While responsibility for the delivery o f local public services rests
with municipalities, services are delivered by local utility companies that operate as autonomous
entities. Many are in a perpetual financial crisis due to low collections, low tariffs and lack of
maintenance. As a consequence, service quality and reliability are generally unsatisfactory, which
makes consumers reluctant to pay the tariffs and the resultant lack o f revenue in turn, prevents
maintenance and causes service to deteriorate s t i l l further. Recent I T A N A T sharing reforms
promise to provide all municipalities, including poor ones, with a stable, autonomous, and
equitable source o f funding. However, BH will need tools to help municipalities enhance
expenditure efficiency and meet minimum standards. An independent benchmarking o f municipal
service delivery and improved monitoring capacity will be necessary. A three-phase strategy will:
i) safeguard quality by focusing on rehabilitation and maintenance; ii) create the conditions for
financial autonomy of utilities; and, iii)adjust tariff levels after improving collections and system
efficiency.
54.
The Government has identified solid waste management capacity as a priority. The
rapidly growing volume o f solid waste outstrips municipal utilities' ability to keep pace. Only 36
percent of households have regular waste removal services, so people burn or dump their waste
illegally - polluting land, roadsides, and rivers thus posing a direct risk to public health. Although
waste collected by municipalities has to be disposed in "official" dumpsites, these are generally
open dumps rather than controlled landfills.

14

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO&FYll

Education

55.
Inefficient education spending has resulted in unacceptably low education outcomes in
BH. Forty percent o f students do not acquire basic skills and knowledge by the end o f fourth
grade, while many students enrolled in costly vocational schools receive insufficient general
education and are ill-equipped to meet the challenges o f today's labor markets. Pre-primary
education enrollment rates are the lowest in the region. While primary education enrollment rates
remain high at about 93 percent, BH has the lowest rate of net secondary enrollment ( 7 3 percent
overall, with only 5 7 percent of the poor attending) of all 12 transition countries for which data are
available.
56.
Recently adopted laws on education, would have the potential to improve the
education system, if implemented. The State Parliament has recently adopted a number o f new
framework laws in education. The challenge now i s to implement these laws effectively. Support i s
being provided by the European Commission for vocational education and training and the
proposed law on the Education Agency. Two laws where little or no international support i s being
provided are the Law on Preschool Education and Upbringing and the Law on Higher Education.
BH's participation in the Bologna process i s a major opportunity to improve the quality o f teaching
and learning and realize efficiency gains.
Health

57.
Despite progress achieved since the war, health outcomes in BH lag behind those
found in other countries o f the region. Some key outcome indicators raise concerns: infant
mortality i s higher than in most CEE countries; the incidence of tuberculosis i s four times higher
than the EU average; disability, posttraumatic stress, depression and chronic diseases rank highly
on the burden o f diseases. Accidents and injuries are at a high level and appear to be rising. The
incidence o f high-cost diseases o f the heart and circulatory system, stroke and cancer i s above the
European averages.
58.
The B H healthcare system i s fragmented and burdened with substantial duplication,
excess employment and inefficient service delivery. Utilization o f primary and preventive health
care i s substantially lower than in other countries in the region, while referral rates to the more
expensive secondary and tertiary care level are high. Efforts to improve primary health care,
resolve a large number o f cases at the primary level, and adherence to standard referral protocols
have started. To improve hospital efficiency, B H would need to reduce a considerable number o f
beds and adjust infrastructure and the health workforce accordingly. Controlling medical
technology costs and quality assurance requires the authorities to consolidate expensive equipment
into one or two tertiary hospitals while ensuring the efficiency o f the referral system. Fragmented
drug procurement and pricing add to the existing inefficiencies and increase the opportunities for
corruption.
59.
The insurance benefit package, co-payment levels and purchasing power vary across
the cantons and the Entities, leading to unequal access to care. Health care i s mainly financed
through payroll social insurance contributions collected by the Health Insurance Funds. Collection
has been poor due to a large informal economy, rampant evasion and substantial legal exemptions
from contribution payments. The consequent deficits result in the accumulation o f payment arrears
and in the implicit rationing. These financial challenges will further increase as the population ages
rapidly, and the concomitant rise in demand for high-cost treatment for chronic diseases. Inequity
in health financing and the high share o f out-of-pocket spending raise concerns about access to
care.

15

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI1
Systematic changes in the way health care is financed, organized and delivered are
60.
required to help improve health outcomes, provide access to quality care and ensure the
financial sustainability of the health care system. I t i s recommended that BH’s health strategy
focus on three main objectives: (i)more efficient resource collection and allocation; (ii)improved
access to quality and efficient service delivery; (iii)improvements in governance and stewardship.
Social Protection
Outlays on social transfers in BH are high, but are not poverty focused. Levels o f
social welfare and child protection are broadly in line with other countries in Central and Eastern
Europe relative to GDP. However, social transfers are not targeted to need and provide ample
opportunities for double dipping, thus having limited impact on poverty alleviation. Further,
coverage across the entities and sub-Entity governments varies considerably. While the number o f
registered social welfare beneficiariesi s large, only a fraction of those receive cash benefits.

61.

62.
Veterans’ benefits are high relative to other disability benefits, pensions and average
wages. When transfers to veterans and survivors are added to the other social transfers, outlays are
even higher and the poverty impact i s further reduced. The tendency of most social protection
benefits to gravitate toward the levels set by the veterans’ benefits i s worrying and potentially
counterproductive. For example, the size o f the potential obligations accrued in the past few years
in the Federation would require tax increases or the reduction o f under-financed welfare benefits.

63.
The social welfare system in BH contains multiple programs that compete for scarce
resources. It i s recommended that the authorities start targeting benefits to need, in line with the
proxy-means testing and conditional cash transfer parameters. Further, spelling out precise
eligibility criteria for more than one benefit, and by strengthening an integrated beneficiary
database to ensure effective monitoring should help reduce opportunities for “double dipping”.
Agriculture

64.
While agriculture contributes 10 percent o f GDP and 21 percent o f overall
employment, 20 percent o f the people working in the natural resources-based economy live in
poverty. BH needs to transition from low technology agriculture towards a modern sector with
agricultural policies and institutions, food safety and animal health requirements aligned with EU
requirements.
65.
Rural productivity needs are still subject to underdeveloped rural credit markets, the
slow land consolidation process and poor rural infrastructure. Land consolidation and
administration improvement (where property rights have been clarified and land markets are more
fluid) could help conserve agricultural land, enforce spatial planning and avoid further urban
encroachment. The context of an ageing rural population and farm fragmentation i s expected to
lead to land consolidation into larger production units and/or pull together farmers associations to
share resources, and involve more mechanization.
The war in BH resulted in significant population displacement as well as the loss o f
66.
property records so that legal records may not correspond with the current patterns o f land
use. As a result, it i s very difficult to complete basic real estate transactions or to borrow money
based on property as collateral, particularly for women who sometimes waive their property and
inheritance rights to male family members.

16

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08-FYI1
Environment

67.
While there i s no national level environment strategy, B H has made progress on some
aspects of environmental management. The MTDS has a chapter on environment, both Entities
are working on their own environment strategies and a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan i s nearly complete. Legal frameworks exist for environmental protection, water resources
management, air quality protection, forestry, and nature protection. There i s also a new focus on
economic instruments for mitigation o f environmental impacts to implement ‘polluter pays’
principles.
However, governance challenges remain, particularly in enforcement, planning and,
68.
management practices. Particular attention needs to be paid to improving: sustainable forest
management; water management practices; and management o f BHs river basins for power
generation, irrigation, tourism, and water and waste water services. Capacity i s weak and needs to
be further developed to harness the potential o f the country’s tourism sector, to help BH prepare for
absorption o f possible EU pre-accession funds and to meet the EU accession requirements.
Disaster preparedness is limited. The prevalence o f regional risks, such as forest fires
69.
earthquakes and communicable diseases have gained increasing attention on the need for disaster
preparedness, reduction and response. BH i s improving i t s surveillance, diagnostics, and technical
capacity to monitor and treat diseases such as Avian Influenza.
C. Governance

70.
BH’s complex governance structure makes governance reform difficult and
commitment to reform appears to be weak. B H lags significantly behind its income group on
three dimensions of governance: political stability/absence o f violence, government effectiveness,
and the quality o f regulation (see Annex 6). A l l o f these dimensions are related to BH’s complex
institutional structure, albeit not to the same degree. BH has several positive governance
characteristics including the functioning of the supreme audit institutions, adoption o f the new law
on public procurement, a free and vibrant press and democratic elections. However, commitment
to tackle the governance agenda in a comprehensive manner appears to be lacking.

71.
EU accession is one of the key entry points for the Bank on governance reform in BH.
While it i s important to address all dimensions o f governance, the Bank’s approach i s guided by i t s
capacity to make a difference and a focus on i t s area of expertise. The OHR takes the lead on
constitutional reform issues, while donors such as USAID, OSCE, the EC, UNDP, SIDA, DFID
and the Netherlands are involved in other aspects of the governance agenda, such as public
administration reform, training of journalists and the Governance Accountability Project. To move
towards EU accession, B H will need to create the European administrative space and strengthen
government effectiveness and regulatory quality. These are the areas where the Bank intends to
focus i t s efforts.

72.
The World Bank will aim to affect both supply and demand factors in governance. In
applying the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption strategy in BH during this CPS, the World
Bank will identify sectors where governance reforms are possible and visible so as to create a
demonstration effect, while also stimulating demand for good governance through local level
accountability interventions, analytical work and strategic communications.
73.
The CPS includes instruments to affect the supply of governance reform. The
performance benchmarks for high-case lending are directly aimed at improving the efficiency and

17

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYObFYII

effectiveness of government spending. CPS benchmarks will regulate the flow of resources to
those policy areas where strong government commitment i s demonstrated and which have the
potential to significantly affect the supply of better governance. Programs under Pillar 1 will aim
to improve the regulatory quality dimension of governance and Pillar 2 will focus on improving
government effectiveness and efficiency in providing services at the municipal level and managing
public resources such as forests and the environment. Finally, the CPS relies on partnerships and
consultationswith key public officials to enhance their ownership of these efforts.

74.
I n addition, the Bank will continue to facilitate the demand for the improvement of
governance by engaging local communities in decision making processes. The CPS will
continue to support youth groups and other NGOs in developing an effective and strategic demand
for improved governance. Throughout the CPS period, effective communication and media
campaigns will be launched to stimulate the demand of citizens for better governance.

WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM
A.

Implementation o f the Last CAS and Lessons Learned

Overall performance under the previous CAS (FYO5-07) was moderately satisfactory
75.
(for the full CAS Completion Report see Annex 2.) The Bank’s investment operations continued to
have a positive impact on improving access to basic services, developing core infrastructure in
support o f economic growth, and strengthening the financial sector. Most o f the projected
outcomes were fully or partially achieved during this CAS period. However, at times, Government
commitment to structural reforms proved to be elusive. The Bank’s adjustment credits’*, based on
MTDS-identified priorities, triggered some important reforms (see below), but the overall pace o f
reforms was slower than expected. Several adjustment credit tranches were not disbursed and a
programmatic DPL that was planned to account for 40 percent o f the CAS base-case lending
program was not delivered. The complexity and aggregate level o f ambition o f Bank adjustment
operations also contributed to this result.

76.

The modestly satisfactory reform performance resulted in a reduced lending program

- between low and base case. Base case lending triggers required satisfactory macroeconomic
performance, satisfactory MTDS implementation, satisfactory progress in improving the business
environment, satisfactory performance towards a reformed public administration and private sector
wage determination mechanisms, and a reduction in the public sector wage bill as a share o f GDP.
These triggers were only partially and unevenly met. The base case lending envelope was projected
at US152 million, but, the actual lending program was U S 1 2 3 million (or 81 percent o f the
projected base case). The Bank’s team demonstrated flexibility in re-allocating IDA resources to
the sectors and operations which demonstrated capacity for further progress and productive use.

77.
As o f June 30,2007, the IFC’s committed portfolio in B H amounted to US$166 million,
of which US$27 million in equity and US$139 million in loans. During the last CAS period, IFC
expanded i t s program, committing US$106 million, compared to U S 6 0 million under the FY0204 CAS. IFC had a number o f successful new operations over the last CAS period, including the
provision of funding to financial institutions to support SMEs and microfinance industry (initially
launched and developed with support of IDA), the promotion of energy efficiency and the
development o f housing finance. I t also supported a glass and chemical company to facilitate FDI
and the transfer o f modern technology and a producer o f generic pharmaceutical products to
increase substantially the variety of domestically produced drugs. IFC has been following closely
opportunities to support private sector participation in infrastructure, but slow progress on
privatization has prevented IFC’s engagement. In addition to BH specific investments, IFC has
also invested in one regional project and two private equity funds, which operate in Southeast
Europe, including in BH.
78.
Pre-war arrears amounting to EUR 48.8 million at the end of October 2007, owed to
the IFC by two government-owned companies, remain outstanding. These arrears have been
transferred to the BH authorities, but resolution o f the situation has been elusive for some years.
The resolution of arrears to IFC would allow the World Bank Group to further increase its program
in BH through mobilizing more resources to finance private sector projects in the country as well
strengthening i t s catalytic role in promoting FDI in the country

79.
MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in B H as of June 30, 2007 amounted to US$203
million, equivalent to 3.8 percent o f MIGA’s total portfolio. Over the last CAS period, MIGA
‘I

Referred to now as Development Policy Lending (DPL)

19

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

issued new guarantees in support o f investments in the financial sector for an overall gross amount
o f about US$136 million.
80.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) carried out during the previous CAS
provide strong input for the current and future policy dialogue. The key pieces o f analytic
work included: Country Economic Memorandum; Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
(PEIR); Labor Market Update; Financial Sector Assessment Program; Debt Sustainability
Analysis; B H Pension System Note; and Fiduciary Update. These reports, the PEIR in particular,
triggered important policy dialogue during the previous CAS period and provide an analytic basis
for the new CPS. In addition, the Policy Notes the Bank prepared provided an opportunity to
discuss with the newly elected governments the priorities for the next four years.
8 1.
I F C advisory services in BH focused on specific programs covering four business lines:
i)value addition to firms, improving management practices, increasing competitiveness o f local
companies and improving supply-chain practices regarding the collection and re-use o f recyclable
materials; ii)improving the business enabling environment with programs on alternative dispute
resolution and sub-national competitiveness; iii) access to finance with programs on housing
finance, micro-finance and sustainable finance; and iv) infrastructure to promote private sector
participation in all infrastructure sub-sectors (although slow progress on privatization prevented the
IFC from engaging in this area).
Box 2: IFC Alternative Dispute Resolution Project
Alternative Dispute Resolution Project

Since 2003, IFC Advisory Services has been implementing an Alternative Dispute Resolution
Project (ADR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina to foster the development o f mediation in order to allow
efficient and cost-effective resolution of commercial disputes. Mediation i s an important factor in
enhancing the business environment, as it helps businesses to unlock capital tied up in litigation
while reducing pressure on the courts. In order to accelerate the resolution o f commercial disputes,
IFC established a cooperation arrangement with the Ministry o f Justice o f Bosnia and Herzegovina
and with other institutions, organizations and development agencies, to ensure institutionalization
o f a sustainable mediation system. IFC also helped to develop a professional cadre of mediators,
trained according to best international practices, and supported the growth of the Association o f
Mediators in Bosnia and Herzegovina (AOM).
As a result, more then 600 cases with a success rate o f 55% were mediated releasing EUR 9.5
million in assets to parties blocked for more than three years in court procedures. Recently, IFC
marked the completion o f successful pilot projects and transferred two fully equipped mediation
centers in Sarajevo and Banja Luka to the AOM. In addition, IFC supported AOM in drafting the
law on Mediation Procedure (enacted by the Parliamentary Assembly of BH in August 2004) and
additional bylaws (enacted by the State Parliament in March 2006). Since July 2007, all necessary
preconditions for full implementation of the mediation law are met and 33 certified mediators are
offering mediation services nation-wide.

82.
Effectiveness delays are causing significant delays in project implementation. All the
projects approved in the previous CAS period have experienced effectiveness delays due to the
complex signing and ratification procedures o f the B H governments. However, the State-level
Council o f Ministers recently expressed commitment to address the issue and has already taken
actions to streamline the ratification procedure. The Bank’s Portfolio Management Team in

20

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1
Sarajevo i s working with counterparts in the Council o f Ministers to develop processes that should
reduce the time between Board approval and project effectiveness to a maximum o f 4-6 months
(from an average of 9-10 months currently).
The Bank maintained a strong relationship with the BH Governments and its services
83.
are still considered highly valuable. Despite the problems encountered with DPLs, the Bank
maintained a strong relationship with the client. The client survey, carried out in OctoberNovember 2006, interviewed about 250 stakeholders, two-thirds of whom were Government
officials at different levels. A client survey indicated high level o f satisfaction with the Bank
services (see Box 3). Clients had a favorable impression of Bank’s effectiveness in BH, with an
average rating o f 7.52 on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). This compares favorably to the
World Bank global average of 6.4. Almost 60 percent o f respondents wanted more Bank
involvement and only about five percent thought that the Bank should be less involved than before.
The Bank’s knowledge combined with its financial resources still seemed to be perceived as highly
(and equally) valuable. Limited use o f local experts and bureaucratic policies and procedures were
identified as the two greatest weaknesses. Government commitment and weak capacity were
assessed as the most significant factors inhibiting future sustainable growth and development.
Box 3: World Bank Client Survey
World Bank Client Survey for Bosnia and Herzegovina
The Client Survey, conducted in late 2006, was followed by in-depth interviews with officials and
staff o f government ministries, parliaments and implementation agencies; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; academic and research institutes; business and private sector organizations; NGOs and the
media. In summary, the findings are:
Almost all respondents evaluate the World Bank and its work in BH as positive, useful and
desirable.
They consider that the Bank has played a significant role in BH and has provided assistance
and support to strategic development.
The attributes most frequently ascribed to the Bank are skill, professionalism, support,
desirability, constructiveness, technical experience, carefulness, significance, seriousness and
importance.
Bureaucracy, insufficient [local] exposure, bad moves and inadequate familiarity with the
current situation in the country are some o f the criticisms o f clients.
Lessons learned and implications for the new CPS
Tailor the CPS program to the level and areas of Government commitment and
84.
capacity to deliver on reforms. Government capacity and commitment to reforms i s the key
factor. While rather obvious, such a principle i s particularly relevant in BH. Identifying areas o f
intervention that have strong ownership by the BH Governments and yet also have significant
development impact will continue to be the key challenge for this CPS.

85.
Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue
development priorities. The uneven experience with DPLs and technical assistance was not due to
a failure by the Bank or by the BH Governments to recognize the country’s main development
challenges. On the contrary, in the design o f both, cancelled, adjustment credits (SOSAC I1 and
EMSAC) the priorities requiring urgent tackling were clearly identified by the Governments, but
were frustrated by political factors. However, the respective Bank teams appear to have
overestimated the capacity of the Government to deal with several parallel reform processes
pursued by different international organizations. Better analysis o f the political economy should be
applied during the preparation and implementation of all projects.

21

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1
86.
Pursue reforms through investment lending and, provided there i s political
commitment, very focused DPLs. Under the previous CAS the Bank provided a combination o f
DPL, investment loans, technical assistance operations and ESW to support BH’s reform program.
Investment operations helped move reform forward in key sectors, including health, energy, roads,
and solid waste management. Although DPLs were less successfLI1, a measurable part o f the reform
agenda supported by these credits was accomplished. Continued policy dialogue resulted in
progress on several fronts. For example: internal audit and procurement laws have been enacted;
synchronized laws on internal audit were drafted; and, while the law in the RS has been enacted,
the laws at the State level and in the Federation are going through parliamentary procedures.
Further, the RS has drafted a law on public sector salaries that aims to bring the existing suprawage allowances into the base wages; to ensure effective mechanisms o f fiscal sustainability; and,
to promote transparency in public wage setting. Efforts should be made in the new CPS to use
investment operations to speed up the reform processes. At the same time, the policy dialogue
should continue and, should the appetite for the pace and type o f reform change, Development
Policy Loans should feature as a part o f the high-case scenario.

87.
Consider project design, which rewards the best performing segments o f BH, while at
the same time not undermining the single economic space. Recent experience suggests the need
for greater flexibility in project design to support reforms and investments where they make the
greatest development impact. Whereas most project funds are currently allocated to both Entities
(in accordance with a pre-set ratio), the World Bank i s willing to explore the possibility o f
introducing, upon request o f the authorities and in selected projects, a mechanism whereby, during
the course o f project implementation, a portion o f the funds would be allocated to the Entity or
beneficiary that demonstrates the strongest ability to absorb more funds and make faster progress
towards meeting the project’s development objectives. It should be stressed, however, that such
performance-based flexibility would only be exercised where the approach i s acceptable to, and
requested by, the authorities and if it will not undermine efforts to deepen the single economic
space and foster social cohesion in BH.
88.
Focus on results and the importance o f monitoring and evaluation beyond Banksupported operations. The focus on results should clearly go beyond Bank financed operations.
Bank teams should assist the Government to set up mechanisms to monitor its own performance,
including enhancement of the country’s overall statistical capacity.
89.
Create an enabling environment for CPS implementation.The CPS requires a carefully
tailored communication strategy that would help the Government explain the benefits o f reforms
and the costs o f inaction. Therefore, the operations to be supported under the new CPS will be
accompanied by a communication strategy that would help the Government and the Bank to
communicate better the potential benefits of the proposed operations, as well as to demonstrate the
benefits and costs o f reforms - or inaction on reform.

90.
Continue to use AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and formulation of the CPS
program. During the previous CAS period, the Bank produced several important documents that
formed a basis for CPS consultations. The PEIR and Policy Notes in particular were useful in
informing policy dialogue. Finally, regional studies (Doing Business, Anticorruption in Transition,
and L i f e in Transition Survey) attracted a lot of interest among policy makers and opinion formers.
These studies provide clear evidence about the trends in BH in comparison with other countries in
the region and should continue to be used strategically to target operations and to develop domestic
“champions” of reforms.

22

B. Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Program for BH

91.
During the CPS implementation period, the World Bank Group will strive to be a
catalyst for the inclusive and sustainable integration of BH’s economy in Europe. Economic
and social development in BH i s part of the process of EU integration. This provides the overall
institutional and legal framework to underpin economic development and poverty reduction in BH.
This i s recognized in the MTDS and continues to be the overall objective of the new Government’s
development agenda, in spite of the slow progress towards signing the SAA in the last twelve
months. Bank-supportedprojects will aim to help B H reach their EU goal.
92.
B H will need to continue to improve the competitiveness of its economy in support o f
its EU objective. B H has made very substantial progress in economic reconstruction since the end
of the war, but compared to other transition countries, more than a decade in transition reforms has
been lost to war and the reconstruction efforts. There i s still a large unfinished reform agenda that
i s holding the country back on i t s goal of convergence with South-Eastern Europe and the EU. The
importance of this unfinished reform process i s recognized by the B H authorities and i s reflected in
the MTDS priorities and State and Entity investment programs. A further indication of the
centrality of the structural reforms for the future of BH i s the signing in October 2007 by the State
and Entity Prime Ministers and the Mayor of the Brcko District, of a joint Platform for Action to
accelerate the implementation of urgent reforms to attract investment, accelerate job creation and
improve living standards in the country (Annex 1).
93.
The new CPS supports the country’s priorities by focusing on two pillars: (a)
improving the environment for private sector-led growth and convergence with Europe; and,
(b) improving the quality o f Government spending and the delivery of public services for the
vulnerable. Under the first pillar, the CPS strives to support the country to: (i)expand business
activity and increase economic opportunities; (ii)improve key infrastructure; (iii) strengthen
regional cooperation to manage public goods; and, (iv) invigorate privatization and corporate
restructuring. Under the second pillar, the CPS will support the governments to: (i)improve the
delivery of municipal services and strengthen municipal finance; (ii)improve the quality o f social
service delivery; (iii) reduce urban-rural disparities in income; (iv) increase the targeting o f social
benefits; and, (v) reduce the burden o f Government in the economy and strengthen fiscal
coordination. Thus, the Bank Group’s program under the new CPS will retain considerable
continuity in view of the previous CAS. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the CPS.

The Allocation of Resources

94.
While a base and high case lending scenarios will be used to define the level of access
to IBRD resources, the Government’s Coordination BoardI3 will also periodically assess the
allocation of Bank resources and update the operations program agreed between the Bank and the
Governments o f BH. Joint annual assessments will consider progress in the preceding year against
the development objectives and results outlined in the CPS and agree priorities for the next two
years. The program will remain shaped by and within the boundaries set by this CPS, combining
the Government’s evolving priorities and the Bank’s corporate strategy. The timing o f these
reviews will be linked to BH’s budget cycle.
T o maximize flexibility and to avoid some o f the pitfalls of the last CAS, the CPS
95.
program i s being notionally divided into a ‘core’ and a ‘non-core’ program. The ‘core’
represents those activities for which political commitment on the part o f the BH authorities has
been tested. I t i s represented by projects and programs already underway or likely to be introduced
in the first two years of the CPS. This includes lending projects, as well as IFC investments,
MIGA guarantees, WBI training activities, TA assignments and AAA work. Outcome indicators
for these activities have been developed and are set out in the Results Matrix in Annex 3. Due to
the flexible nature o f the CPS, the results matrix will be further developed as the program evolves
and will be revisited in the mid-CPS Progress Report.
The ‘non-core’ program represents interventions in areas where political commitment
96.
needs testing or where a ceiling on resources will prevent implementation in the early years o f
the CPS. The ‘non-core’ program represents two types of situation. First, those reform areas
where the Bank Group could support B H to make progress, but where (given past experience with
slow moving or cancelled projects) political commitment needs to be tested prior to re-engagement.
Where possible, these important reform areas will be monitored and supported with non-lending
activities, such as TA and ESW. Second, those projects where commitment i s apparent, but where
a ceiling on resources will prevent implementation in the early years of the CPS. Decisions
regarding the prioritization of these projects and the appropriate instruments will be taken jointly
by the World Bank and the authorities at the annual Coordination Board review o f CPS progress.
Financial Envelope

97.
BH continues to benefit from exceptional access to I D A resources. Due to its low
creditworthiness and despite a per capita income that exceeds the normal IDA cut-off by a large
margin, B H has continued to receive access to IDA resources.
98.
Over the last CAS period, B H had an envelope of SDR78 million IDA, with access to
IBRD lending conditional on achieving enhanced creditworthiness. Creditworthiness was
proxied by five performance benchmarks. During the CAS period, B H achieved some, but not all
of the performance benchmarks and, therefore did not draw any IBRD resources (see Annex 2).
The Base Case
99.
The CPS spans the last year of IDA14 and the 3 years o f IDA15, during which a
phasing out o f I D A i s expected in BH. In the first year of the CPS, SDR16.8 million (US$26m at
current exchange rates) o f IDA resources are available, which i s the full performance based
allocation after taking into account front-loading o f IDA assistance in FY07. In the second year,
” The

Coordination Board comprises the three Prime Ministers and their respective Finance Ministers, plus the Mayor o f Brcko District.

25

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI1

the full performance based allocation would be again available to BH - which i s expected to be
about SDR25 million (US$39 m i l l i ~ n ) ' ~ Thereafter,
.
BH would receive two-thirds o f its full
performance-based allocation (PBA) in FY 10 (estimated at SDR 17 million) and one-third of the
allocation in FY 11 (estimated as SDR8 million), with an expectation o f graduation from IDA at the
end o f FY 11.
100. Reflecting some improvement in economic performance since the last CAS, limited
volumes of IBRD will be made available to BH in the base case of this CPS. In FY08 and
FY09, access to IBRD would be limited to U S 3 5 million (over the two years), in FY 10 a ceiling o f
US$24 million and in FY 11 a ceiling o f US$37 million IBRD i s proposed, bringing the total
resources available to B H in each year to roughly US$50 m i l l i ~ n ' ~Overall
.
during the CPS period,
a maximum o f US$200 million would therefore be available in the base case.
101. To remain in the base case, B H will need to demonstrate: continued satisfactory
macroeconomic performance; satisfactory debt sustainability prospects; and no reversals of
key economic reforms.
The Hiah Case
102. The high case reflects a stronger reform environment and strengthened
creditworthiness prospects. In addition to meeting the base case indicators, B H would need to
take concrete steps towards the creation o f a single economic space, as evidenced by measurable
progress in implementation o f the Platform for Action signed by the three Prime Ministers and the
Mayor o f Brcko District in October 2007. In the high case lending scenario, IBRD incremental
lending would be limited to an annual amount o f USD20 million.
A Low Case
103. Any serious deterioration in the base case indicators would cause the Bank to
reconsider its levels o f support. Serious repercussions from regional political events or the
worsening of the political dialogue on the reform agenda would cause the Bank to review its
lending arrangements to BH. Under a low case scenario, project preparation would proceed more
slowly and would focus only on those parts o f the program where there i s the greatest crossgovernmental support.

104. Table 3 below sets out specific indicators, against which progress will be assessed
jointly (with the BH Governments) and collectively (Le. a collective assessment o f progress
and reform momentum) to evaluate whether higher levels o f lending are justified. The
Coordination Board will undertake such an assessment annually. A mid-CPS Progress Report will
be undertaken by the Bank in partnership with the authorities in late FY09 and submitted to the
Board. The levels o f access to IBRD will be reviewed at that point. Access to IDA would not be
linked to these assessments; rather it will continue to be based on the performance based allocation
system as described below.

l 4 This i s the estimated allocation in FY09, based on performance in FY08 and assumptions about the size of IDAIS. Actual allocations
during the CPS period will be determined on an annual basis and will depend on: (i)total IDA resources available in IDA15, (ii) the
country's performance rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers and (iv) the number of IDA-eligible
countries. The US$ amount will also depend on the prevailing SDR:US$ exchange rate.
The US$ amount will also depend on the prevailing SDR:US$ exchange rate.

Lending and Analytical Program

-

-

105. Within the first pillar improving conditions for private sector led growth the B H
authorities have indicated a strong demand for a core lending program focused on
infrastructure (in particular transport and energy). These are areas where the Bank’s program had
strong results in the last CAS and have the potential for further development impact. In support o f
the goal of improving key infrastructure, the core program will include on-going projects to improve
hydropower and thermal power stations and improve access to reliable, low-cost electricity. An
Energy Sector Study will inform future potential World Bank Group supported projects in this area.
The B H authorities are keen to receive additional World Bank Group support to put in place
measures that would spread risks and limit fiscal costs o f establishing new power generation and
transmission infrastructure through private sector participation; the aim o f such support would be
on assisting the authorities to meet the Energy Community Treaty commitments, for example by
helping put in place transparent and competitive procedures (in accord with the relevant EU
Directives) for solicitation, selection and authorization of all new power generation and
transmission projects.
106. A comprehensive sector strategy will drive the Bank’s engagement in transport. The
State and Entity ministries, with support from the World Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), are now developing a comprehensive transport sector
policy and strategy framework covering aviation, roads, railways, urban transport and inland
waterways. A new project in support o f maintenance o f roads and road safety will be delivered in
FY08. Further, the authorities have expressed considerable interest in a Sava River project which
would include marking o f the waterway and the rehabilitation o f the port on the Sava River in Brcko
which used to carry considerable volumes o f freight. The Bank plans to support this project in the
early years o f the CPS. Projects supported by the EBRD, and the EIB will continue to improve the
rail infrastructure.

27

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

107. The Bank and other donors are also assessing the possibility of further assistance to the
authorities’ plans to build the European Transport Corridor Vc. In addition to EBRD and EIB,
which have demonstrated readiness to finance sections o f corridor Vc, the resources used to build
such a project should come largely from the private sector. The Bank Group and other donors may be
able to assist with limited financing for less profitable sections o f the road, a guarantee, transaction
advice from the IFC andor other technical assistance. As in energy, the focus of support to such big
infrastructure projects will be on ensuring that the process i s conducted in a manner that i s
transparent, competitive and avoids the escalation o f costs.
108. The World Bank Group anticipates playing an important role helping the
Government to structure possible public private partnerships (PPP) transactions. The IFC
will continue to seek opportunities to help the Governments to structure private sector participation in
transport, energy and municipal waste treatment. Through i t s Private Enterprise Partnership in
Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) advisory facility, IFC will explore the opportunities to support PPPs
through project preparation, structuring transparent bidding processes, and mobilization of financing.
MIGA can also play a role in supporting foreign direct investment in infrastructure through the
provision of political risk guarantees. During FY07, the Bank held a training seminar on PPPs that
was very well attended by a cross-section of regulators and officials from BH. Follow-up activity
has been requested and will be implemented through the CPS period.
109. The authorities have also expressed interest in stimulating rural business and
agriculture. Under the core program, a small-scale agriculture project i s underway, which aims to
help farmers make productivity gains through credit lines, provide assistance in forming producer
associations and help in easing supply-chain bottlenecks. A regional Land and Gender Review will
identify the extent to which land rights are different between men and women in B H and examine
the impact o f these differences on women’s access to land markets and any impact on family
welfare as a result o f gender differences in land ownership. The study will outline key issues
examining the intersection between formal entitlements and actual practices with respect to gender
and women’s access to resources for land. A land registration project which was approved in 2006
may be a candidate for a second phase or increased financing, if it proceeds well.

110. Regional issues will receive greater attention during the CPS period. In the core program,
the Bank supported Avian Influenza Preparedness Project, which provides critical support to
enhance public health system infectious disease response and control capacities, i s expected to
become effective in the first year o f the CPS. The importance of climate change and hazard risk
management has been brought into stark relief after significant forest fires in the region during 2007.
Mitigation and adaptation activities under a regional Southeast Europe Disaster Risk Reduction and
Adaptation Program may form part o f the non-core program.
11 1. The Bank is also supporting projects on environmental protection, both to improve
governance and transparency and to support tourism. The Forestry Development and
Conservation Project, which promotes capacity building and governance in the sector, received
additional financing in FY07. Environmental capacity building will also be supported in the CPS
period through the implementation o f two GEF-funded projects: Neretva and Trebisnjica
Management Project (for the water sector), and the Forest and Mountain Protected Areas Project
(for biodiversity conservation and tourism promotion).
112. I n the corporate sector, I F C and M I G A will continue to support strategic FDI in BH
with a focus on encouraging regional cooperation by encouraging good and growing companies
active in the region to invest in BH. IFC will focus on investors in the commercial property and
food sectors. IFC will also seek opportunities to support domestic companies, such as the

28

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FY08-FYI1

automotive, metals and tourism sectors, to become more competitive in the domestic and regional
market. IFC focus will be on post privatization support, as well as facilitation o f the transfer of
technology and increased competitiveness. WBI and the Bank are cooperating on joint program to
promote private sector led-growththrough innovation and technology in selected sub-sectors. IFC’s
PEP-SE will continue to be active in supporting S M E development in BH. MIGA will be open to
support FDI in the manufacturing and agribusiness sectors through the provision o f guarantees.
MIGA will also consider opportunities to promote SMEs in BH through its Small Investment
Program.

113. The Bank will also continue to promote reforms that aim to expand business activity
and improve the business environment. A Business Enabling Credit that yielded several notable
results, including improved access to finance, faster bankruptcy procedures and a more efficient
inspection regime, i s due to close at the time the CPS starts and will be evaluated in the first year o f
the CPS. In this CPS period, an Enterprise Restructuring Grant from the European Union,
administered by the Bank, will aim to move the corporate restructuring agenda forward with a
restructuring o f over a dozen Voucher-Privatized Enterprises and will pave the way for further
corporate restructuring.
114. Non-lending service will also support the improvement of the business environment. An
Investment Climate Assessment will be produced during the first year o f the CPS. Further, the Bank
will support improved corporate financial reporting and auditing in line with international standards.
Other Bank Group interventions towards this goal in the core program may include IFC advisory
services and WBI’s capacity building and in conjunction with other development partners. WBI also
has a program to improve the competitiveness of the ICT sector in BH.
115. Privatization, corporate restructuring and firm exit reforms are areas where
commitment has been mixed under previous Bank projects. While there i s strong demand for
Bank support for corporate restructuring from some parts o f Government (the RS in particular),
uneven performance on these reforms under the last CAS suggest that this be part o f the non-core
program to be supported initially by training activities and ESW. Additional Bank financial support
would be considered to support privatization or corporate restructuring if commitment to reform in
this area i s demonstrated.
116. The IFC will continue to be active in the financial sector, using loan and equity financing,
as well as advisory services. IFC will seek strategic partners to establish greenfield banks and
support local financial institutions to develop into high-quality banks, while continuing to support the
development of microfinance, leasing, housing and energy efficiency through existing financial
institutions. MIGA will also consider opportunities to support foreign strategic investors in the
financial sector, focusing on projects which promote the development o f specialized products, such as
leasing, and improve SMEs’ access to finance.

117. Under the second pillar - improving government effectiveness - the Bank will support
efficiency improvements in agriculture. An Agriculture and Rural Development Loan, approved in
FY07 for implementation through this CPS period, will help improve the efficiency of public
financing for the agricultural sector under the core program by strengthening the capacity of the
State- and Entity-level institutions to deliver more efficient and effective agricultural services. It
will also accelerate the country’s eligibility to access support under the EU Instrument for PreAccession Assistance for Rural Development (PARD).
The project will also promote
harmonization of food safety and animal health requirements to the EU acquis communitaire.
Associated farm and client registries should allow better targeting o f subsidies.

29

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

118. The BH authorities have indicated interest in continued investment borrowing for social
service projects, including pension system reform, but performance in other human
development projects has been uneven. In the core program, the Bank has a social insurance TA
program and an employment services project due to close soon after the introduction of the CPS.
Education and health projects are also underway, both of which will close towards the end o f the CPS
period. While the health project i s proceeding well, limited commitment to reform in education and
in social protection has led to lower than anticipated development outcomes to date. Therefore, the
Bank will continue to try to influence these important parts of BH’s social service agenda under the
non-core program with policy dialogue and AAA. If progress i s seen in some of the areas listed as
challenges in the sectoral section o f the CPS, further engagement will be warranted. For example, a
new social sector project, possibly pension reform, will be considered in the outer years of the CPS.
119. Bank support for municipal development i s of particular interest to the authorities.
Under the core program, the Bank’s urban infrastructure project assists municipalities to improve
service delivery. A new Municipal Development Project will be introduced in the early years o f the
CPS. A community development approach proved to be a successful instrument for investments in
small local infrastructure in the poorest municipalities. IFC will also seek to support local authorities
and help them in structuring private sector participation in municipal infrastructure. However,
institutional capacity i s weak and the legal framework i s not yet adequate to allow for private sector
participation arrangements in public infrastructure projects at the municipal level.
120. The Bank has been active in the solid waste sector and plans to continue in this area.
The current Bank-supported project has established six regional landfills; safe methods of disposal;
public awareness; training o f sector staff; and has extended waste collection to those areas that are
not currently serviced. However, additional bilateral funding sought from numerous donor agencies
has not resulted in any concrete commitments. Given the financing gap and repeated and urgent
requests by the Governments, the Bank provided additional financing to the project and has been
requested to support further implementation o f the Nationwide Solid Waste Management Strategy
to arrive at nationwide coverage o f the program. More financing will be provided to complete the
national coverage o f this project in the early years o f the CPS.
121. The Bank will also continue to advocate for structural reforms to improve fiscal
coordination and improve the emciency and tracking of public expenditure more broadly
through non-core and non-lending activities. Further financing activities in this area would be
considered for fields where commitment to implement the Platform for Action i s demonstrated, and,
as opportunities to engage emerge. Strategic communications will be critical to create knowledge
and public demand for structural reform in partnership with the authorities and other donors.
122. Capacity and coordination in the field of statistics are weak and need urgent
improvement. The existence o f multiple statistical agencies with weak capacity has hindered the
effective collection and analysis of statistics. Most nationwide survey efforts since the war have been
donor-financed. Capacity building in the area o f statistical reporting remains a focus o f the Bank’s
poverty work, including through training undertaken in conjunction with WBI. The lack of a census
since 1991 presents major difficulties in establishing per capita statistics and in effectively targeting
vulnerable groups. Should it be decided to proceed with a new census towards the end o f this decade,
World Bank support would be provided.
123. Flexibility, results and partnerships are the key operating principles of the CPS. The
political deadlock o f the last twelve months, the difficult institutional environment and the
experience accumulated with the implementation of the previous CAS indicate that the Bank needs
to fine tune the CPS program in relation to the level and areas o f Government interest as well as

30

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FY08-FYI1

their commitment and capacity to deliver reforms. This requires a flexible approach to the
partnership program, a strong focus on results and close partnerships with other donors. Resources
will be channeled towards those specific policy areas or sub-sectors where reform commitment and
an opportunity to engage exist. Additional resources may be used to top up or extend existing
successful operations, to introduce new operations and/or to introduce DPLs.

Flexibility

124. The customary system o f allocating Bank resources to BH has not encouraged
flexibility. To date, most Bank loans have been made to the State of BH and then divided
according to a pre-determined ratio between the two Entities. Progress has been assessed
nationwide, so that delays in preparation, effectiveness or implementation o f a project in one Entity
have held up the project in relation to both Entities.
125. I n early 2007, the authorities proposed a greater degree of flexibility in project design.
The flexibility proposed would allow more funds to be absorbed by the Entity or beneficiary that
demonstrates the strongest ability to make progress towards the development objectives o f the
project. The Bank i s open to supporting all options that support reforms and investments where
they can make the greatest development impact, but the ultimate decision on the allocation of funds
in each project must l i e with the authorities. Therefore, were the authorities to request such
performance-based flexibility, the Bank would be open to explore ways to allocate part o f
individual project financing to Entities or beneficiaries on a performance basis provided it will not
undermine efforts to deepen the single economic space and foster social cohesion in BH..
Results

126. The proposed program of activities is results-oriented. The program i s designed to help
B H reach its overarching goal o f EU accession. It supports the MTDS goals and those in the
recently signed Platform for Action. A results matrix i s attached (Annex 3). To enhance results in
individual operations the Bank has agreed to introduce flexibility in some projects (as described
above).
127. The Bank will aim to promote monitoring and evaluation capacity building beyond its
portfolio. Bank-supported projects will seek to impact sector-wide monitoring of results by the
authorities. Enhancing BH’s statistical capacity i s an important element o f this approach.
Furthermore, the Bank will seek opportunities to enhance the role o f civil society to monitor and
evaluate the performance o f their elected officials. The CPS will be monitored jointly by the Bank
and the B H authorities on an annual basis. Findings o f the annual portfolio reviews will be
presented to the Coordination Board for review and action.
C. Partners’ Role and Participatory Process

128. B H still enjoys significant, albeit declining, support by development agencies. Overall,
in 2007, support by 18 most active development agencies (excluding EIB) in B H i s expected to
reach EUR 400 million. Areas that attract most support include private sector development,
financial sector (including microfinance), municipal development, agriculture, and social
protection. See donor matrix attached in Annex 4.
129. The authorities have yet to assume full leadership over donor coordination. Domestic
capacity for donor coordination i s still weak and fragmented. However, there has been progress in
developing adequate architecture for donor coordination following the decision to transfer donor
coordination o f responsibilities from the Ministry o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations o f B H
to the Ministry o f Finance and Treasury o f BH. It i s expected that these recent activities, supported
by DFID, will build capacity o f the Government to be more pro-active in specifying i t s needs to
donors and in guiding and monitoring the manner in which assistance i s delivered. In addition to
this, UNDP supports development o f a Grants Resource Management System (GRMS) that should
further strengthen Government’s capacity for donor coordination.

32

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYObFYll

130. Meanwhile, the Donor Coordination Forum (DCF) represents the main vehicle for
coordination and exchange of information among donors. The DCF was established in
December 2005 as a semi-formal platform o f information exchange among major donors in BH.
Guided by the principles o f the Paris Declaration, the objective o f the DCF i s to enhance the
efficiency of the use and allocation o f official development assistance in the country and thus
secure better aid effectiveness. In 2006, the DCF secretariat conducted the first Donor Mapping
Report for BH. This report includes past, current and future resource allocations o f the 18 largest
donors in BH (including the Bank). Furthermore, an interactive donor mapping database was
established thus allowing for regular updating of information about donor programs in BH.
13 1. The authorities’ over-arching goal i s EU accession and the Bank i s partnering closely
with the EU in order to ensure that support provided by the Bank enhances the prospects of
B H reaping the benefits o f EU accession as soon as possible. The Bank will continue to
strengthen further i t s close collaboration with the EC - particularly in pursuing public sector
reform and reforms in the agriculture sector in accordance with the EU standards. Partnership with
the EC and regional development banks (EBRD and EIB) in supporting investments in transport
and energy sectors have already yielded positive results and leveraged significant volumes o f
resources. A Joint World Bank-EU office in Brussels facilitates coordination of development issues
with the EC.
132. Cooperation with other development partners remains close and will be further
reinforced during the CPS period. Examples o f successful partnership with development partners
over the last CAS period include: partnership with SIDA (Sweden) in promoting Agriculture and
Rural Development; with GTZ and SIDA in developing and implementing the Land Registration
Project; with DFID in supporting development o f an enabling business environment; and, with
EBRD and EIB in transport and energy. In particular, strong cooperation with EBRDEIB will be
continued in supporting infrastructure investments. Over the CPS period, close cooperation will be
required with UNDP, USAID, the Government o f the Netherlands, and SIDA in developing a
common front in supporting municipal development. DFID remains an important partner in
corporate restructuring and promoting efficient and pro-poor public financial management, as well
as social sector reforms in the interest o f the most vulnerable categories of the population. Finally,
the Bank will continue its close collaborationwith the IMF.
Participatory Process

133. The CPS was developed after substantial consultations with key stakeholders.
Consultations were organized in two phases: preliminary consultations (late 2006 - early 2007),
and another round o f consultations conducted in September-October 2007. During the preliminary
consultations, the Bank team obtained feedback from the outgoing and newly elected Government
officials (following the October 2006 elections). Thorough preliminary consultations were also
conducted with key development partners through a thematic session of the Donor Coordination
Forum and through separate consultative meetings with the EC, EBRD, DFID and continued
consultations with IMF. Inputs from civil society representatives were received at the CPS
consultation meetings and through regular interaction with the Youth Voices Group - a consultative
body operating in association with the Country Office.

134. Formal consultations with key Government officials were held in September 2007 at a
Coordination Board meeting organized for this purpose in addition to continuous, informal,
discussions. The formal discussion of the new CPS program was based on the following: (i)key
principles outlined in the MTDS; (ii)recently adopted development strategies o f the two Entities;
(iii)Government’s response to the Bank’s policy notes; (iv) lessons learned from the previous

33

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO8-FYI1

CAS; (v) substantial AAA work carried out during the previous CAS; and, (vi) transition to IBRD.
Broad agreement was reached about areas of intervention and principles that should shape future
partnership. Following the formal consultations with the Government, the Bank team engaged in
additional consultations with development partners and civil society through separate meetings.
Feedback received from these meetings i s reflected in the CPS document.
135. Donors emphasized the need for a common approach, while civil society organizations
emphasized their role in monitoring. Two messages came out clearly in the consultations. First,
development partners increasingly recognize the need for a common approach in supporting much
needed structural reforms in an environment where there i s limited commitment by the authorities.
Second, civil society organizations insisted on partnership with the Bank in introducing sound
monitoring and evaluation practices. Given that ensuring a strong development impact o f public
spending i s the cornerstone o f the Bank program in BH, partnership with civil society organizations
with demonstrated capacity to promote sound monitoring and evaluation practices will be explored
further during this CPS period.

34

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO&FYII

IV. MANAGING RISKS
136. Despite strong economic performance and a reasonably healthy portfolio, the level of
risk in the B H program i s substantial.
Internal

137. The greatest risk to implementation of the B H program is political obstruction of
economic reforms. The previous CAS assessed that sufficient reform commitment would allow
for a strong structural reform agenda through a series o f DPLs, anchored by the SAA with the EU.
This CPS i s more cautious and proposes to support reforms in the base case through investment
loans and advisory support, with policy-based lending only in the high-case and subject to
assessments of commitment.
138. Heightened political polarization between the three constituent peoples and the key
political parties leads to delays and contentious negotiations. The positions o f the Entities are
often mutually exclusive. For example, while the Federation generally seeks a stronger role for the
State in every project, the RS would generally prefer no State involvement. This charged
atmosphere makes project preparation, negotiations, effectiveness and implementation slow. To
mitigate the risk o f slow or faltering project implementation, the degree and form of the State-level
involvement will be negotiated on project by project basis. Agreement will be sought on the
aspects o f the project to be undertaken at the State level early in project preparation. Political
economy analysis will be undertaken in each project and strong signals o f ownership and
commitment will be required prior to proceeding. The political costs o f reform and risks o f
instability need to be weighed carefully against the potential growth and poverty reduction benefits
they could bring.
139. The complex and fragmented governance structure of B H potentially undermines
government transparency and accountability. This potentially allows entrenched interests and
informal networks along ethnic, professional and economic interest lines to thrive. In such an
environment, corruption may be difficult to detect. The Bank will continue to use Bank-systems o f
financial management and procurement to mitigate the risk o f fund misuse.
140. The transition from I D A to IBRD may reduce BH’s interest in World Bank loans. B H
has been borrowing on IDA hardened terms for some years although BH’s per capita income
exceeded the normal IDA cut-off. The blending arrangement proposed in this CPS and the recent
price reduction for IBRD loans will help the BH authorities move smoothly from IDA through
blend towards IBRD-only status.

141. Access to other sources of finance, including significant EBRD and EIB loans and EU
grants may also render the Bank’s products and advice less attractive. The World Bank has
partnered successfully with other development banks in BH to leverage (rather than compete with)
their programs. The authorities have a genuine interest in continued World Bank support to BH.
The relationship between the Bank and the B H authorities remains strong as evidenced by the
Client Survey (April 2007) which reports strong satisfaction with the Bank in BH. Meanwhile,
increasing attention to Africa by bilateral donors may see international aid flows to B H decline at a
faster-than-anticipated pace. Coordination with other donors and the strength o f the Country
Office help to keep the World Bank’s advice relevant and timely.
142. Substantial risks exist that outstanding domestic claims will be settled at a fiscally
unaffordable level. Such an outcome would reflect ongoing pressures by vested interests - which

35

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor F Y 0 6 F Y I I

the governments have resisted so far - to provide more generous settlement terms than the
estimated face value of about 16 percent of 2007 GDP. Risks are also large so that the ultimate
settlement of property restitution, and any other contingent liabilities that may emerge, could
undermine debt sustainability.
External

143. The key external risk to BH’s program arises from the lack o f resolution of KOSOVO’S
status. Specifically, it i s feared that discussion on autonomy or independence for Kosovo could
negatively affect the political environment in BH. Lack of international support for a divided BH,
including from the EU, may inhibit such a move.
144. High growth rates in recent years have undermined the need to make structural
change in the economy for the medium-term. A sharp reversal of the currently favorable
external climate, particularly high international prices for metals and wood, could result in a ‘hardlanding’. This CPS period will see a more sustained and strategic use of communicationthat seeks
to inform the public of the costs of inaction on the reform front and to stimulate debate about
options and trade-offs. As other emerging markets, BH faces risks related to the ongoing
turbulence in international financial markets. There are also risks that negative economic events in
one country in the region could spill over to others since the foreign-owned banks which dominate
BH’s banking system are present throughout the Central and Eastern Europe and beyond. Slower
inflows of foreign investment, should these risks materialize, would have a negative impact on
BH’s growth prospects.
145. The OHR maintains an interventionist approach in BH with active use o f the ‘Bonn
Powers’. Should the international community’s support for this role and the approach wane, BH
may become caught in a political gridlock, falling further behind its neighbors. There i s currently a
broad agreement amongst the internationalcommunity that such a role i s still needed in BH.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
This completion report evaluates the implementation o f the World Bank Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) FY05 - FY07 for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH). The current Bank program has
been closely focused on supporting key reforms in BH envisaged under the country’s Poverty
Reduction Strategyhledium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS). The FY05-FY07 CAS period
has been characterized by:

relatively strong growth, driven largely by high international prices for BH’s main
commodity exports, but
slow progress in structural reforms and therefore in BH’s transformation to a modern
market economy.
COUNTRY’S OBJECTIVES
In the MTDS, BH committed itself to pursue three objectives in parallel during the period 20042007:
0
Create conditions for sustainable and balanced economic development.
0

Reduce poverty by 20 percent from the 2004 level.

0

Accelerate EU integration.

COUNTRY OUTCOMES
B H has come a long way since the end of the 1992-95 conflict, but a lot more remains to be done to
achieve the MTDS goals. The physical post-conflict reconstruction effort has progressed well. The
Government has implemented numerous political, security sector and state-building reforms, which
enabled the start o f SAA negotiations in December 2005. BH experienced strong growth over the
past three years (5-6 percent of GDP). Some economic reforms, most notably the successful
introduction o f a flat rate VAT from the start o f 2006, as well as customs and banking sector
reforms, have also been completed and have earned B H an upgrade of i t s credit rating by Moody’s
(from B3 to B2) in early 2006.
Nevertheless, a large outstanding reform agenda remains. A large current account deficit (estimated
at 16.9 percent o f GDP in 2007) poses a risk to macro-economic stability, and unemployment and
poverty remain high. Thus, there i s an urgent need to accelerate structural reforms and improve the
climate for private sector development while ensuring that state building and EU integration
activities are carried out in a fiscally responsible manner.

CAS OBJECTIVES
The CAS for B H covering FY05-07 was presented to the Board o f Directors in September 2004,
and was anchored in the MTDS. I t was structured along three mutually reinforcing pillars,
reflecting BH’s principal challenges:
0

Pillar I:

Improving public finance and strengthening institutions;

0

Pillar 11:

Promoting sustainable private sector led growth; and

0

Pillar 111:

Investing in key social and economic infrastructure.

Annex 2

This CAS marked the end of exceptional post-conflict levels o f I D A for BH. IDA
commitments were reduced from an average of over US$lOO million per year during the immediate
post conflict reconstruction (FY96 - FY03) to an average of about US$40 million per year during
this CAS period. B H continued to benefit from exceptional access to IDA, despite a per capita
income three times above the IDA threshold.
CAS OUTCOMES
Overall CAS performance was moderately satisfactory. The Bank’s investment operations
continued to have a positive impact in improving access to basic services, developing core
infrastructure in support o f economic growth, and strengthening the financial sector. Most o f the
projected outcomes were fully or partially achieved during this CAS period. However,
Government commitment to structural reforms proved to be elusive. The Bank’s adjustment
operations (today Development Policy Loans - DPLs), although based on MTDS-identified
priorities, failed to trigger necessary reforms. The complexity and aggregate level of ambition of
Bank adjustment operations also contributed to this result.
WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
The World Bank’s overall performance was moderately satisfactory. Investment projects were
appropriately designed and well supervised leading to satisfactory outcomes and a strong, positive
development impact. However, the reform scenario pursued by the Bank during the FY05-07 CAS
was complex and overly ambitious. The Bank misjudged the Government’s and Parliament’s
capacity and readiness to pursue such an ambitious program o f reforms. Nevertheless, the Bank
remained proactive and flexible in resolving identified weaknesses and has maintained a strong
relationship with the client. Apart from the failure o f some adjustment operations, most of the
investment credits maintained satisfactory performance ratings throughout the CAS period.
According to a recently conducted client survey, the Bank’s analytic and advisory activities remain
highly valuable in informing policy dialogue and will play an important role beyond this CAS
period. The client survey also showed a high level o f satisfaction with the work of the Bank in BH,
and 60 percent o f respondents requested a greater involvement with financial and knowledge
support.
LESSONS FOR FUTURE CPS DESIGN

Recommendations for the preparation o f the next CPS are summarized below:
Tailor the CPS to the level and areas of Government commitment and capacity to
deliver on reforms. Identifying areas o f intervention that have strong ownership by the
Government will be the key challenge for the next CPS.
0

0

Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue
development priorities. Experience with some adjustment loans and technical assistance
operations during this CAS suggests that the Bank overestimated the capacity o f the
Government to deal with several complex reform processes in parallel. Better analysis o f
the political economy in the B H should be applied during the preparation o f the next CPS.
Pursue reforms through investment lending and, provided there i s political
commitment, very focused DPLs in the outer years. Several investment operations

43

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO&FYII

Annex 2

helped move the reform in their respective sectors forward. Efforts should be made in the
new CPS to use the potential o f investment operations to impact on the reform processes.

Consider project design, which allows the best performing beneficiaries to absorb
more project finance. However, care should be taken to ensure this does not undermine
the single economic space, strengthening the State, or fostering social cohesion.
Focus on results and importance o f monitoring and evaluation using Bank financed
operations to impact sector-wide monitoring o f results by the authorities.
Create an enabling environment for CPS implementation. The next CPS and Bank
financed operations should be accompanied by communication efforts that would help the
Government better communicate the benefits o f the proposed reforms and strengthen local
capacity to debate alternative development choices.
Improve internal communication and greater synergy between the Bank teams from
different sectors and across the World Bank Group should be encouraged. Synergy
between the Bank teams may lead to better outcomes and help the Government effectively
respond to cross-sectoral issues.
Continue to use AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and formulation o f the new CPS
program.
Reduced I D A allocations, and a likely small IBRD lending program, will necessitate
concentration on fewer operations and a less ambitious reform agenda. This will also
require closer collaboration with other international partners to leverage World Bank
Group resources. In particular, the Bank should complement the E C and i t s efforts to assist
BH in the process o f EU integration.

1. INTRODUCTION
This report reviews the experience implementing the World Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) presented to the Board of Directors in
September, 2004. The Bank’s program under the CAS FY05-07 was closely focused on supporting
key reforms in B H envisaged under the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategyhledium-Term
Development Strategy (MTDS). The FY05-07 CAS period was characterized by:
0

relatively strong growth, driven largely by high international prices for BH’s main
commodity exports; and
slow progress in structural reforms and therefore in BH’s transformation to a modern
market economy.

2. COUNTRY’S OBJECTIVES
BH’s complex political and institutional environment, with a State-level of government and
two entities (the Federation and Republika Srpska) each with revenue-raisingpowers, continues
to present a challenge for domestic policy makers as well as international community actors. Not
surprisingly, the authors of the MTDS experienced many difficulties while trying to develop a
comprehensive yet realistic and sustainable development strategy for BH. Finally, after a
successful consultative process, all levels of government in B H committed themselves to pursue
three objectives in parallel during the period 2004-2007:
0

Create conditions for sustainable and balanced economic development.

Through implementationof the macroeconomic reform scenario o f the MTDS, B H aimed to
restore partial creditworthiness on the international capital markets, establish a functioning
market economy and strengthen the capacity of domestic companies to compete in external
markets, particularly in the EU market. In view of variations in the level of economic development
between different parts of the country, creation of a more balanced and equitable development of
a l l parts of B H was also recognized as crucial.
0

Reduce poverty.

The 2005 Poverty Update found that one in five inhabitants o f B H may be considered poor.
The MTDS aimed to lower the poverty rate by 20 percent from the 2004 level by accelerating
structural reforms, which in the short term might have caused job losses, and consequently an
increase in poverty, but would have put BH on a longer-term path of sustainable growth. Therefore,
all levels of government were urged to implement such economic policy measures that would
address the main causes of poverty including: slow pace of reforms, high unemployment, poor
quality of education, and high levels of corruption. The MTDS outlined the following reforms and
measures that were to be implemented in order to achieve projected poverty reduction: (i)fiscal
reform to ensure a more effective collection of public revenues and higher assistance to the poor;
(ii) accelerate the private sector growth to increase employment; (iii) establish an adequate system
of social protection; (iv) reduce corruption; (v) reduce the level of “informal economy”, which
would lead to increases in pensions and reduction of poverty among the elderly; (vi) ensure
safeguarding of human rights guaranteed by the existing legal framework and signed international
treaties, which would lead to a better integration of returnee and Roma population into the
community and reduce the poverty levels among these categories; (vii) fully implement the Law on
Gender Equality; and (viii) the reform of the education system.

Annex 2

Accelerate EU integration.

Integration o f BH into the EU has been a generally accepted goal o f all governments and all
segments o f society for some time. The MTDS aimed to accelerate integration of the country into
the EU, and the focus was placed on signing and implementation of the Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA). In particular, by implementing the actions outlined in the MTDS,
BH would have met the second and the third Copenhagen Criteria, i.e. the existence of a
functioning market economy able to endure on the EU market, and the ability to assume
obligations arising from EU membership.
3. COUNTRY’S PROGRESS TOWARDS ITS OBJECTIVES
Macroeconomic performance
Economic activity has remained robust, supported by some structural reforms
3.1
introduced before and during the CAS period, privatization of some enterprises, as well as
buoyant remittances and rapid credit growth. Nonetheless, conditions for sustained privatesector led growth are yet to be created, leaving growth vulnerable to a substantial slowdown. Over
the past decade, nominal GDP has trebled and i s now approaching pre-war levels. The
reconstruction process has generally been highly successful, due to BH’s own efforts and
unprecedented levels of donor support (donor flows amounted to more than US$5 billion, including
commitments by the Bank of more than US$1.1 billion in credits and grants between 1995 and
2006). Average real GDP growth has picked up to 6.3 percent in 2006 from about 5.3 percent on
average in the previous three years, due in large part to the re-starting of production at Mittal Steel
after i t s privatization, and the impetus to production from a jump in international prices for metals
and other raw materials. Consumer price inflation, anchored in the currency board arrangement,
has been stable and/or low, except for the one-off pick up in inflation in 2006 due to the
introduction of the VAT. The current account deficit has narrowed to about 10.7 percent of GDP
in 2005 from about 20 percent on average in earlier years, due to robust across-the-board export
growth and much improved statistical coverage in the context of VAT introduction. Nonetheless,
the current account deficit has subsequently widened again to 16.9 percent of GDP in 2007and
remains large and a key vulnerability. External weaknesses are exacerbated by limited progress in
advancing structural reforms, including privatization, which has kept inflows of foreign direct
investment low (approximately 3.5 percent of GDP a year).
The V A T was successfully introduced. One of BH’s major achievements during the CAS
3.2
period was successful introduction of a state-wide single-rate VAT from the start of 2006. Also
noteworthy was the harmonization of indirect taxation, culminating in the establishment of the
Indirect Tax Authority at the beginning of 2004. The RS introduced simplified personal and
corporate income tax laws in 2006; the Federation in late 2007.
B H rating on external debt was upgraded to B2 in early 2006. Moody’s Investors
3.3
Service upgraded BH’s key debt ratings to B2 from B3 in early 2006 in light of the economic and
institutional advances that had taken place since the rating were first assigned in March 2004. The
affected ratings include the foreign currency country ceiling for debt and the Government o f BH’s
domestic and foreign currency issuer ratings. The rating outlook i s s t i l l stable.
3.4
Large government spending remains a drag on the economy. Government spending
amounts to about one-half of the official GDP (and over 40 percent of GDP adjusted for the
informal economy). Even when adjusted, spending i s about 5 percent of GDP higher than other

46

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FY08-FYI I

Annex 2

countries in south eastern Europe and well above fast growing economies in the region, including
the Baltics, Ireland or Slovakia. Strong revenues from the VAT helped the modest fiscal surplus in
2005 triple in 2006, but the medium-term outlook i s at risk due to decisions enacted before the
October 2006 elections to further increase non-targeted social benefits. Resolving outstanding
domestic claims resulting from war damages, property restitution, and frozen currency deposits
could also add a significant burden to the budget, as could plans to boost infrastructure spending on
roads and electricity generating capacity.
3.5
Absence of rule-based intergovernmental transfers worsened fiscal imbalances
between levels o f governments (vertical) and across regions (horizontal). The new VAT
allocation mechanism seeks to address, at least partially, both the vertical and the horizontal
imbalances in intergovernmental fiscal transfers; however, its real impact i s still unknown. There
are substantial regional variations in per capita revenues and expenditures, with municipalities
witnessing the largest horizontal fiscal disparities in both entities. Uneven regional economic
development and reliance on an origin-based tax sharing principle has resulted in the poorest and
stagnating regions being left behind. Vertical fiscal imbalances favor the revenue-raising entities
and run against the State level government and the municipalities because o f their very limited own
revenues as a source for financing their current responsibilities.
Unemployment and poverty reduction

3.6
BH has made a little progress in reducing unemployment and poverty. While new data
enabling estimates o f poverty for 2004-2007 will be available only after the next Household
Budget Survey i s published in 2008, it i s likely that poverty has fallen since 2004 due to strong
GDP growth and increases in real wages and pensions. Data for 2005 suggest that about 18 percent
o f the population i s below the poverty line, with another one-third in danger of falling into poverty.
Unemploymentand poverty are strongly linked and remain persistently high (data for 2004 suggest
that about 20 percent o f the population are unemployed; a more recent Labor Force Survey put the
number at 3 1 percent, but there are questions as to the quality o f data underpinning this result).
3.7
Social services: relatively high spending levels do not lead to satisfactory outcomes.
Inefficient spending within institutionally complex structures results in poor outcomes. Education
and health outcomes are broadly comparable to other countries with similar incomes, but much
lower than would be expected given high current spending levels. In education, while general
government expenditures are relatively highi6 (higher than the OECD average), education
outcomes are unacceptably low. For example, the percentage o f students performing below
minimum acceptable standards in the 4th grade mathematics i s at 43 percent in the Federation B H
and 35 percent in the RS. In the health sector relatively high spending levels also do not seem to
produce satisfactory outcomes. Indicators related to maternal deaths, infant mortality and
immunization(measles) are much worse than in other countries with similar levels o f spending.
3.8
Social transfers in B H are insufficiently targeted to the poor and there i s no evidence
that these transfers have had any impact on poverty reduction. According to the Bank’s Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (September 2006), social transfers financed via general
revenues amount to 4 percent o f GDP, with veterans’ benefits accounting for about two-thirds o f
this spending. During the CAS period, these untargeted benefits were increased. Only a small
fraction o f general revenue financed transfers are means-tested with the aim o f providing a safety
net for the most vulnerable groups. While veterans’ benefits are very high and not based on need,

l6 As

a percentage o f GDP

47

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FY11

Annex 2

the social welfare and child protection system in BH remains underdeveloped with spending
relative to GDP lower than in almost all countries in the region including the new member states of
the EU. The MTDS acknowledges that reform i s needed to introduce fewer better defined benefits,
more efficient benefit administration, and better targeting mechanisms based on vulnerability rather
than the status, but political will to make such changes has been lacking.
Progress in advancing structural reforms has been limited. Privatization has barely
3.9
been advanced in the Federation BH over the last two years, while the RS authorities have recently
made reasonable progress. In particular, progress on this front slowed substantially ahead of the
elections held in October 2006. As a result, the private sector generates only about one-half of
GDP. The business environment i s not perceived as investor-friendly, despite recent improvements
in the areas of business registration, bankruptcy and business inspection. The Bank’s Doing
Business 2008 rates B H 105‘h out of 178 countries (roughly equivalent to i t s neighbors but well
behind the new EU member states and lower than 2006 and 2007 ratings). The key areas of
concern are: starting a business, dealing with licenses and permits, and registering property.
Licensing and permit requirements are also excessive, with both indicators worse in the Federation
BH than in the RS. Recent passage of the business registration and business inspection laws in both
entities offers a real opportunity to advance private sector development.
3.10
Levels of corruption are still high and “state capture” remains the biggest concern.
The World Bank study “Anticorruption in Transition 3” found that the highest level of state capture
in the ECA region was perceived by firms in BH. The impact o f state capture was also perceived to
have an increasingtrend in 2005 compared to 2002 figures. State capture refers to corruption in the
law-making process (powerful business elites influence decision and policy making of the state)
and can have a very negative impact to an economy and society as a whole, because it can
fundamentally and permanently distort the “rules of the game” in favor o f a few privileged
insiders”.
Accelerate EU integration
3.1 1
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) negotiations are technically complete
and BH joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace program. Furthermore, in July 2006, the B H
Directorate for European Integration (DEI) developed the “EU Integration Strategy of Bosnia and
Herzegovina”, a comprehensive document which reviews the situation in BH, the situation in the
EU and necessary measures to be taken in the process of EU integration. Seven consultative
working groups composed of 124 civil servants from State and Entity ministries and institutions, as
well as external national experts, developed this Strategy, which i s a comprehensive document
covering the period right up until full membership in the EU. The fact that B H opted for
developing an EU Integration Strategy at such an early stage reflects i t s intention to accelerate and
assume full ownership of the integration process. However, B H did not manage to initial i t s SAA
during the CAS period due mainly to the failure to agree on police restructuring measures.
Revised MTDS
3.12
Implementation o f the MTDS could be significantly improved through better
prioritization and more realistic planning. B H revised i t s MTDS in 2006. The revised strategy
reaffirmed BH’s commitment to the three main objectives outlined in the original strategy.
However, it recognized that the implementation and impact of reforms could have been
17

48

Annex 2

considerably improved through better prioritization. The revised MTDS, that was approved by the
Council o f Ministers and both Entity governments and subsequently presented to all three
parliaments, disaggregated the three main objectives into the following six general development
priorities in BH:
0
0

0

0

Maintain macroeconomic stability;
Increase private investments;
Restructure the economy;
Increase employment and strengthen connections between human resources and the labor
market;
Improve the system o f social protection; and
Increase transparency and capabilities o f BH society.

3.13

The revised MTDS i s an improvement to the original document but it requires
stronger linkages to the budget and medium term expenditure framework (MTEF). As
outlined in the Joint Staff Advisory Note on the Revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IMF
and IDA, June 2007), further improvements could be made to the strategy, including:

The development of a costed strategy integrated with annual budgets, the MTEF and the
Public Investment Program (PIP), and consistent with the fiscal revenues and foreign
assistance likely to be available.
Greater prioritization focusing on and clearly linked with poverty reduction and growth
enhancement, specifying realistic implementation timeframe.
An improved set of monitoring indicators, related to overall objectives and inputs that can
be controlled by the government. .

4. CAS OBJECTIVES
The FY05 - FY07 CAS was anchored in the MTDS and was structured along three mutually
reinforcing pillars, mirroring BH’s principal challenges:
0

Improving public finance and strengthening institutions, through:

(i) a leaner and more efficient public administration and civil service;
(ii) institutionalization o f fiscal coordination between various levels o f government;
(iii)
more efficient and higher quality education administration;
(iv) better-targeted and more efficient social safety nets; and
(v) greater transparency and accountability o f public resource management.
Promoting sustainable private sector led growth, through:

(i) lower barriers to business activity;
(ii)more competitive, investment-friendlyenterprises;
(iii)improved corporate sector operations;
(iv) more robust private sector financing services;
(v) increased efficiency and access to core economic infrastructure; and
(vi) more efficient and sustainable natural resources utilization.
0

Investing in key social and economic infrastructure, through:
(i) promoting effective protection o f the vulnerable through a fiscally sustainable social
safety net, including rationalized veterans benefits;

49

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

Annex 2

(ii)improved health sector management and better access to quality health care;
(iii)
improved service quality in water and sanitation, electricity, and local roads;
(iv) a higher quality and more equitable education system;
(v) greater rural agriculture productivity and profitability; and
(vi) conservation of critical forests and mountain ecosystems.
5. CAS RESULTS

5.1
The CAS was result oriented. While not formally a results-based CAS, since such CASs
were mainstreamed only in January 2005, the BH CAS was still results oriented. The CAS
contained a monitoring and evaluation system starting from a “results framework” (which lays out
the logical relationships between interventions and outcomes) with measurable indicators to track
progress.
The CAS has been generally well aligned with the MTDS and i t s moderately
5.2
satisfactory results reflect BH’s moderately satisfactory overall performance against the
MTDS targets. The three pillars o f the CAS closely mirror the objectives of the MTDS. Of the
three CAS Pillars, Pillar 2 “Promoting sustainable private sector led growth” has had the best
progress. Pillars 1 and 3 - “Improving public finance and strengthening institutions” and
“Investing in key social and economic infrastructure” made less progress because of the slow
implementation of the reform program and the delayed start of several projects. The matrix which
outlines progress against agreed outcome indicators i s attached as Annex Ito this report.
Results under Pillar 1 “Improving public finance and strengthening institutions”
5.3
were seriously affected by the lack of progress in implementing structural reforms. Despite
progress in strengthening budgetary practices, and rationalizing intergovernmental transfers a large
number of results under this pillar were not achieved. Overall, 8 out o f 23 outcome indicators under
General government spending was reduced to
this pillar were not accomplished (see Annex I).
about 48 percent o f GDP in 2006, but it i s still much larger than most other countries in emerging
Europe and faster growing economies in other parts o f the world. There was little progress in
improving the efficiency o f the education sector administration. Only limited progress was made in
ensuring better management o f the social protection system. New legislation on veteran benefits
was adopted but annual budgets in the Federation far exceeded the targets agreed in the CAS (i.e.
the legislated nominal freeze at the 2005 level was not maintained). The pension reform strategy
has not been formulated. The PEIR, as the key piece of analytic work underpinning this pillar,
provides recommendations on improving the composition, quality and effectiveness o f public
spending to help shift to a more growth-oriented fiscal policy. The PEIR recommends reducing
general government spending by 7 percent o f GDP by 2010 to help reduce the government burden
on the economy and help accommodate fiscal pressures, including those related to settling
domestic claims and restitution and strengthening public institutions as EU accession i s advanced.
Progress under infrastructure projects and continued strong performance in the
5.4
financial sector contributed to satisfactory performance under Pillar 2 “Promoting
sustainable private sector led growth”. There has been continued progress in developing core
infrastructure in support o f economic growth. Projects supporting investments in solid waste, the
power sector, urban infrastructure and road management and safety maintained satisfactory
performance throughout the CAS period. A l l outcome indicators related to “private sector
financing services”, “core infrastructure” and “growth based on more efficient use o f natural
resources” were either fully or partially accomplished. In the financial sector, banking has
remained strong and has further improved performance. The Financial Sector Assessment Program

50

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO&FYll

Annex 2

provided recommendations on additional steps that need to be taken to ensure the long term
soundness o f the financial sector in BH. The Bank-supported microfinance operation (Second
Local Initiatives Project) met the objective o f ensuring sustainable access to credit services for
micro and small enterprises. Legislation on business registration and inspections has been adopted
in the two entities in an attempt to improve the overall business environment. However, a lack o f
progress in corporate restructuring and privatization negatively affected results under this pillar.
The Bank’s Policy Development Programmatic Credit and Privatization Technical Assistance
Credit operations failed to trigger appropriate actions on these two fronts.
Pillar 3 “Investing in key social and economic infrastructure”: access to basic services
5.5
has improved but the social sector still does not provide adequate services to the vulnerable
population. Large inefficiencies in the health and education sector are yet to be addressed. There
was modest progress in improving efficiency, quality and access to health care. Education system
remains poorly aligned with the changing needs of the economy. The social protection system i s
also inefficient and requires the introduction o f better targeting mechanisms to benefit the poorest
and the most disabled. The PEIR provided an assessment of inefficiencies in these sectors as well
as recommendations on actions that could be taken to address the identified weaknesses. On the
other hand, Bank supported infrastructure projects, as well as efforts made under the Community
Development Project and Small Scale Commercial Agriculture Development Project, have helped
improve access to basic services across the country. Agricultural productivity has increased and the
Bank financed operations contributed to notable improvements in the quality of and access to basic
services in water and sanitation, solid waste, electricity, and transport.

5.6

The modestly satisfactory reform performance resulted in a reduced lending program

- between low and base case. Base case lending triggers required satisfactory macroeconomic
performance, satisfactory MTDS implementation, satisfactory progress in improving the business
environment, satisfactory performance towards a reformed public administration and private sector
wage determination mechanisms, and a reduction in the public sector wage bill as a share of GDP.
As discussed in the previous sections, these triggers were only partially met. Consequently, the
Bank lending program was between low and base case. The base case lending envelope was
projected at US$152 million while the actual lending program was US$123 million (81 percent of
the base case). In light of the adjustment operations not moving ahead, the Bank’s teams responded
quickly and redirected resources to areas where further investments were needed and would have
positive development impact. Additional financing was approved for four investment operations,
while new operations were designed to meet demands in the agriculture sector, land registration
and to help the country prepare a response in the case o f avian flu outbreak.
At the same time, progress has been made against the high case (IBRD) lending. An
5.7
assessment o f BH’s progress i s presented in Table 1.
Effectiveness delays - the key cross-cutting portfolio issue. Complex signing and
5.8
ratification procedures in three levels of government caused significant delays in project
implementation.A l l the projects approved in this CAS period experienced significant effectiveness
delays’’ and required several extensions of the effectiveness deadlines. While effectiveness delays
may be another indicator of the poor ownership of the projects, procedural (rather than substantive)
issues were the main reason for delays in the complex administrative set up o f BH. Delays in
forming parliaments and governments after the October 2006 elections blocked every activity on
this front for several months. However, the State level Council o f Ministers recently expressed

6. IDA PERFORMANCE
Satisfactory performance was maintained under most of the investment credits.
6.1
Projects aimed at strengthening the financial sector were well designed and effective, with Private
Sector Credit playing a role in strengthening the banking sector in the RS while the Second Local
Initiatives (Microfinance) Project continued with successful development o f the microfinance
sector in BH. A In the agriculture sector, Small Scale Commercial Agriculture Development
Project has been successful in developing sound agriculture practices and building capacity o f
financial intermediaries to extend financial services to farmers. Bank teams designed effective
operations in the area o f infrastructure and energy. These operations maintained satisfactory
performance throughout the reporting period (see Annex 11). Similarly, adequate design and
supervision of projects aimed at strengthening local governments and improving capacity o f the
local utility companies (Solid Waste Management, Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery, and
the Community Development Project) lead to a positive effect in stimulating local economic
development.
Performance under most of the adjustment credits and technical assistance credits
6.2
was less than satisfactory. Poorer performance was found in the three structural adjustment
credits (Second Social Sector Structural Adjustment Credit - SOSAC 11; Economic Management
Structural Adjustment Credit - EMSAC; and Business Enabling Environment Structural
Adjustment Credit - BAC), and related technical assistance projects (Social Insurance Technical
Assistance Project - SITAP; and Privatization Technical Assistance Project - PTAC). These
operations were designed during the previous CAS period (CAS FY02-FY04) with the objective to
tackle a backlog o f tough structural reforms. The BH authorities were not able to achieve all the
requirements for tranche releases under the structural adjustment credits, resulting in these
operations experiencing serious delays. While there has been continued, although slower than
expected, progress under BAC and SITAP, poor performance under SOSAC 11, EMSAC and
PTAC led to cancellation of these operations.

SOSAC I1 - the credit was intended to cap, in nominal terms, very high war veterans’
benefits and to redirect social transfers to the most vulnerable groups in society. Although
the RS has come some way toward meeting the conditions, political pressures have led to
back-tracking by the Federation BH, which instead substantially increased total spending
on war veterans. Despite extensive discussions, the Federation B H authorities have proved
unable to undertake a minimum credible package o f reforms that would allow a
restructuring o f the credit. The VAT revenue surge has encouraged significant fiscal
expansion in both the RS and the Federation B H in the lead up to October 2006 elections.
As a result, two years after the Board approval the credit could not be declared effective
and finally US$5 1 million o f the IDA credit lapsed on June 30,2006.

-

PTAC lapsed on August 16, 2006 with less than US$4 million of the US$23 million
disbursed five years after the credit was approved. This primarily reflected a lack o f
enthusiasm on the part o f the authorities, especially in the Federation, to borrow for
technical assistance despite the concessional nature of the credit. Government officials
have suggested that their reluctance reflected high prices charged by international
consultants, but have been unable to hire even (lower-priced) local consultants, making this
argument untenable. In the Federation, the key underlying reason for the unsatisfactory
performance under the credit reflects lack of political consensus on the pace o f
privatization. In the RS, progress has been somewhat better and the credit helped finance
consultants for the largest privatization in the country to date (RS Telekom).

53

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

Annex 2

EMSAC - lapsed on December 3 1, 2006 with U S $ l O million disbursed in December 2004
and an undisbursed second tranche of US$24 million. The decision to let the second
tranche o f the credit lapse was due to lack o f progress in meeting the agreed conditions.
Namely, attempts to advance higher education reform failed; no progress was made in
advancing reforms o f public wages, and internal audit laws were not passed (the three
remaining EMSAC conditions). Six months after the credit lapsed, the authorities enacted
a version o f the higher education law that has been under discussion before the credit
lapsed, but the law lacks many o f the provisions that would have made it acceptable to the
Bank. Similarly, eight months after the credit lapsed there i s no progress achieved on
public sector wages, and only the RS has enacted an internal audit law.
BAC -while slower than originally anticipated, progress continues to be made in the areas
o f business registration and inspection reform. Although the closing date o f this credit has
been extended ten times, each time it was clearly linked with progress against a certain
benchmark. The Bank team has received a “highly satisfactory” QAG rating for the quality
o f supervision.

6.2
A Policy Development Programmatic Credit (PDPC) that was planned to account for
40 percent of the CAS base case lending program was not delivered. The Bank team identified
corporate restructuring as the critical issue to be addressed during this CAS period and Government
counterparts repeatedly stated the need for an operation in this area. However, during PDPC
preparation the Government demonstrated little actual commitment to corporate restructuring. At
the same time, the Bank team was unable to identify an “entry point” to develop a coherent
corporate restructuring policy program. The proposed approach that would link significant
payments to fictitious and redundant workers to encourage them to leave companies, with
enforcement o f changes in ownership and management practices in state-owned companies, proved
to be overly complex and ambitious. Finally, given the performance o f other adjustment credits and
the lack o f BH’s commitment to structural reforms, it was decided that PDPC should not proceed.
6.3
The lack of government commitment to undertake structural reforms and overly
complex operations, resulted in less than satisfactory performance under adjustment
operations. A combination of several factors led to this result. First, the Bank overestimated
government’s capacity and commitment to pursue structural reforms in the complex political
environment o f BH. After the 2002 elections, for the first time since the war, BH had a government
with a four year mandate. The impressive results o f the post-conflict reconstruction and the relative
lack o f political tensions suggested that the international community may be successful in
supporting the newly elected governments to pursue a more dynamic reform agenda. However, the
Government’s ownership of the reform agenda proved to be weak and the key reason for the lack
o f progress. Second, some of the projects supported by the Bank were overly complex. The targets
to be achieved under the above mentioned adjustment credits were numerous. Further, the reform
scenario was based on the available data that proved to largely underestimate the size o f GDP and
overestimate the current account deficit. For example, IMF projected a fiscal deficit o f 5.8 percent
o f GDP in 2003 and three percent of GDP in 2004 while the outcome was substantially different
with a fiscal deficit o f two percent of GDP in 2003 and 0.4 percent o f GDP in 2004. As the global
economy entered into a period of robust expansion with metal prices surging, the pressure to secure
external funding for the budget and to reduce the current account deficit eased. Finally, the VAT
revenue surge in 2006 and the prospect of new elections, which were held in October 2006, further
reduced the appetite to secure budget funding by pursuing tough, although much needed, reforms.

54

Annex 2

6.4
I D A was proactive in trying to improve the Government’s ownership of the reform
agenda. The Bank consulted very closely with the BH governments as well as with key
development partners regarding cancellation of these loans. In January 2006, a high level retreat
was held between the Bank team and the key government officials including the Chairman o f the
Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister of the Federation BH and the Ministers of Finance from
both entities, to discuss next steps in moving the reform agenda forward. On this occasion
government officials confirmed their commitment to the reforms envisaged under the adjustment
credits and the Bank expressed readiness to restructure some operations, subject to demonstrated
progress over the short-term. However, there was little evidence of such progress in the following
months and it was finally jointly agreed that allowing these credits to lapse was the most
appropriate course o f action in the given circumstances.

6.5

The Bank team demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in allocating I D A
resources to the sectors and operations which demonstrated capacity for further progress.
Poorer performance in areas of structural reform and the lack o f Government’s willingness and
capacity to engage in corporate restructuring reform might have suggested that IDA resources
allocated in this CAS would not be used. Instead, the Bank’s teams identified sectors where new or
additional financing may be used productively. While such flexibility was welcomed by the B H
Government and ensured maintenance o f a good relationship between the Bank and i t s client, this
carried a risk o f abandoning certain projected outcomes. Nevertheless, all new and additional
financing was in line with the MTDS and CAS objectives.

6.6
The Bank maintained a strong relationship with the BH Governments and i t s services
are still considered as highly valuable. In spite o f the problems encountered with adjustment
credits as discussed above, the Bank maintained a strong relationship with the client. The client
survey, carried out in October - November 2006, interviewed about 250 stakeholders, two thirds o f
whom were Government officials at different levels. The client survey indicated high level o f
satisfaction with the Bank. In terms o f the Bank’s effectiveness in BH, clients have had a favorable
impression with an average rating o f 7.52 on the scale from 1 to 10. This compares favorably to the
World Bank global average o f 6.4. Interestingly, almost 60 percent o f respondents wanted more
Bank involvement and only about five percent thought that the Bank should be phasing out and be
less involved than before. The Bank’s knowledge combined with i t s financial resources still
seemed to be highly (and equally) valuable. Limited use of local experts and bureaucratic policies
and procedures were identified as the two greatest weaknesses. Government’s commitment and
weak capacity were assessed as the most significant factors inhibiting future sustainable growth
and development in BH.

6.7
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) carried out during this CAS period have
provided strong input for the current and future policy dialogue. The key pieces of analytic
work included: Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR); Labor Market Update;
Financial Sector Assessment Program; Debt Sustainability Analysis; and Fiduciary Update.
Although these pieces of analytic work, and the PEIR in particular, triggered some important
policy dialogue during this CAS period, the contribution of these reports will extend beyond this
CAS and will form an analytic basis for the next CAS. In addition to providing an excellent
analysis o f public expenditures that informed and triggered policy dialogue on this subject, the
PEIR dissemination was also highly satisfactory. PEIR dissemination and discussions on particular
sector issues involved sector teams and has contributed to broader understanding o f problems
related to public spending in BH. The PEIR dissemination i s summarized in Annex I11 to this

55

report. In addition to these, the Bank provided a set o f ten Policy Notes2’ to the newly elected
governments. These policy notes provide a summary assessment of the areas that require actions
over the next four years and provide recommendations about priorities.
Overall, BH’s portfolio performance indicators compare well with ECA and Bank
6.8
averages (see Table 3 below). The average age o f projects at the end o f FY07 was 3.3 years and
the overall disbursement ratio was 15.4 percent. In ECA, the average age was 3.2 years and
disbursement ratio was 18.8 percent while for the Bank as a whole the average age was 3.4 years
and the disbursement ratio was 22.8 percent. Effectiveness delays were the main reason for the
lower disbursement ratio in FY07. The percentage o f commitments at risk was 3.3 compared with
10.1 in ECA and 14.7 for the Bank.

This CAS marked the end o f exceptional post-conflict levels o f I D A for BH. IDA
6.9
commitments were reduced from an average o f over U S $ l 00 million per year during the immediate
post conflict reconstruction (FY96 - FY03) to an average o f about US$40 million per year during
this CAS period. The number o f projects has been reduced from 20 at the end o f the last CAS
period to 16 at the end o f FY07. The active portfolio of Bank financed operations at the end o f
FY07 amounts to about US$300 million. About 37 percent o f the committed amount has been
disbursed (US$112 million). The l i s t of projects i s attached as Annex I1 to this report. BH’s
continued exceptional access to IDA, despite a per capita income now three times higher than the
IDA threshold, was justified given i t s lack o f access to IBRD or capital market finance. However,
in the next CPS, B H will need to graduate to IBRD terms, which may also improve the
Government’s ownership and planning of the use o f resources borrowed on less concessional
terms.

chemical company to facilitate FDI and the transfer o f modern technology, and support to a
producer of generic pharmaceutical products to substantially increase variety o f domestically
produced drugs and replace expensive imported medication. In particular, support to further
development of the microfinance industry in BH represents a success story of complementarities
between IDA and IFC. The microfinance industry which had been initially launched and
developed with support of IDA continues to develop into a commercially viable industry with
support from LFC. Also, IFC has been closely following opportunities to support private sector
participation in infrastructure. However, slow progress on privatization prevented IFC from
engaging with financing and advisory services in infrastructure projects. In addition to B H specific
investments, IFC has also invested in one regional project and two private equity funds, which
operate in Southeast Europe, including in BH.
I F C Advisory Services in BH are provided through PEP-SEt4and have been focused
7.2
on specific programs covering four business lines:
0

Value Addition to Firms: which seek to increase knowledge and improve practices
through a combination o f direct company-level assistance, public awareness campaigns
(combination of trainings, seminars, workshops), and in-company consultancies. Expected
impact o f the programs are: (i)improving management practices in both financial
institutions and industrial companies, with the objective of attracting more investment; (ii)
increasing competitiveness o f local companies looking for export opportunities in the EU
as well as global markets; (iii)improving supply-chain practices in scrap metal, plastic and
glass recycling industries and increasing collection and re-use o f recyclable materials.

0

Business Enabling Environment: with programs on alternative dispute resolution, and
sub-national competitiveness. The alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program has been
active since 2003 and seeks to introduce quicker, cheaper and better access to justice for
companies and individuals through mediation. In cooperation with FIAS, IFC has been
streamlining regulations related to business inspections, permits and licenses, and
increasing the efficiency o f regulators. The program i s expected to increase private sector
investment and reduce the cost o f doing business in selected municipalities.

0

Access to Finance: with programs on housing finance, micro-finance, and sustainable
finance. IFC has supported the development o f micro-finance institutions, through a
combination of financing and advisory services, to develop new products such as energy
efficient home improvements. IFC has also supported the transformation o f microfinance
institutions into fully regulated financial institutions. Current investment and advisory
services clients include MI-BOSPO and EKI.
Infrastructure: promoting private sector participation in all infrastructure sub-sectors.
Slow progress on privatization has prevented IFC from engaging in a more active advisory
role in the privatization o f key infrastructure projects and in attracting private sector
participation.

Annex 2

8. LESSONS FOR SUBSEQUENT CPS DESIGN
8.1
Tailor the Bank supported program to the level and areas of Government
commitment and capacity to deliver on reforms. Government capacity and commitment to
reforms i s the key. While rather obvious, such a principle has proven its full value in BH. The Bank
seemed to misjudge the political complexity of B H and i t s Government’s expressed commitment to
pursue structural reforms was taken at face value. Identifying areas o f intervention that would have
unconditional ownership by the Government and would have the greatest development impact will
be the key challenge for the next CPS. The Bank team should involve counterparts in the early
stage of the CPS preparation.

8.2
Improve political economy analysis when deciding about the instruments to pursue
development priorities. Recent experience with structural adjustment loans and technical
assistance operations should not be interpreted as failure to recognize the country’s main
development challenges. On the contrary, in the design o f both SOSAC I1 and EMSAC the
priorities that should be urgently addressed were identified by the government, but frustrated by
political factors. However, while developing the reform agenda to be addressed under these two
credits, the Bank teams also overestimated capacity o f the Government to deal with several parallel
reform processes (military and police reduction, constitutional changes, EU integration, public
administration reform, social sector reform, education reform, investment climate, privatization
etc.). Better analysis o f the political economy in the BH should be applied during the preparation of
the next CPS.
8.3
Pursue reforms through investment lending and, provided there i s political
commitment, very focused DPLs in the outer years. A substantial and tough reform agenda i s
ahead o f the recently elected governments at all levels in BH. The Bank has tried to assist with a
combination of structural adjustment credits (containing conditions related to progress in almost all
key areas), investment loans, technical assistance operations and ESW to strengthen BH’s capacity
to implement needed reforms. The results o f such a multi-faced approach were not encouraging.
On the other hand, several investment operations helped move the reform in their respective sectors
forward (health, energy, roads, solid waste management). Efforts should be made in the new CPS
to recognize potential of investment operations to speed up the reform processes. Development
Policy loans may be a feature o f a future high-case scenario, should the appetite for reform change.
8.4
Consider project design, which allows for performance-based flexibility, while at the
same time deepening the single economic space, strengthening the State, and fostering social
cohesion. Recent experience suggests that there may be a need for greater flexibility in the project
design to support reforms and investments where they can make the greatest development impact
using performance-based allocation o f some project financing. However, care will be taken to
ensure that such flexibility does not exacerbate divisions between the two Entities. Such an
approach would be exercised only if it i s requested by the authorities and if it will not undermine
efforts to deepen the single economic space and foster social cohesion in BH.
Focus on results and importance of monitoring and evaluation using Bank financed
8.5
operations to impact sector-wide monitoring o f results by the authorities. The Bank teams
should assist the Government to set up mechanisms to monitor i t s own performance and be on top
of the agenda, including enhancement o f the country’s overall statistical capacity. The focus on
results should clearly go beyond Bank financed operations. The Bank teams should help their
counterparts develop appropriate results framework for all operations.

58

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYO8-FYI1

Annex 2

8.6
Create an enabling environment for CPS implementation. As discussed in section 6.3,
the Bank overestimated the capacity and ownership o f the Government to pursue structural
reforms. At the same time, the Bank should have recognized that even with the stronger
Government’s ownership such an ambitious reform scenario would have required a carefully
tailored communication strategy that would help the Government explain the benefits o f reforms
and the costs o f inaction. Discussion about the main pillars of the next CPS should be followed by
a discussion about a broad communication strategy that would help the Government better
communicate the potential benefits of the proposed operations.

8.7
Improve internal communication and greater synergy between the Bank teams from
different sectors should be encouraged. Greater synergy between the Bank’s sector teams, and
across the World Bank Group, may lead to better outcomes and help the Government effectively
respond to cross-sectoral issues. Internal communication between the teams should be improved.
The PDPC experience showed that poor communication between sector units resulted in an overly
complex and ambitious operation for which there was little interest among the counterparts.

8.8
Continue to use AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and formulation of the new CPS
program. During this CAS period, the Bank produced several important documents that should
form a basis for CPS consultations. The PER and policy notes in particular will be useful in
informing policy dialogue. Finally, regional studies (Doing Business, Anticorruption in Transition,
L i f e in Transition Survey) attracted a lot of interest among the policy makers and opinion formers.
These studies provide clear evidence about the trends in BH in comparison with other countries in
the region and should be used strategically to develop domestic “champions” o f reforms.
8.9
Reduced IDA allocations, and a likely small IBRD lending program, will necessitate
concentration on fewer operations and a less ambitious reform agenda. This will also require
closer collaboration with other international partners to leverage World Bank Group resources. In
particular, the Bank should complement the EC and support BH’s EU integration efforts.
CONCLUSION

The results o f the previous CAS and the Bank’s overall performance were moderately satisfactory.
Most o f the investment credits maintained satisfactory performance throughout the CAS period,
and infrastructure projects in particular continue to make positive development impact. Although
based on stated commitments in the MTDS, the reform scenario pursued by the Bank during the
FY05-07 CAS was complex and overly ambitious. The Bank also misjudged Government’s
capacity and readiness to pursue such an ambitious program o f reforms. However, the Bank
remained proactive and flexible in resolving identified weaknesses and has maintained strong
relationship with the client. The Bank Group’s analytic and advisory activities remain highly
valuable in informing policy dialogue and will play an important role beyond this CAS period.
Finally, portfolio performance indicators suggest that the appropriate actions were taken to ensure
that a healthy portfolio i s carried forward into the next CPS period. Important lessons can be drawn
from this CAS that should influence design o f the future program. The importance of the
Government’s demonstrated commitment and ownership i s obviously the key. However, better
assessment o f the political economy, complexity of the environment and well defined
communication strategy are as important in developing a sound program.

Annex 5

Annex 5: Relationshipwith the EU and Progress Towards EU Accession
1) Stabilization and Association Process (SAP)

The Stabilization and Association Process (SAP) i s a special regional approach o f the European
Union (EU) that has been designed exclusively for the Western Balkan countries to pave their way
for membership o f the EU. SAP i s the cornerstone o f the EU’s policy towards the region, aiming to
promote stability and to facilitate closer association with the EU. The credible prospect o f
membership o f the EU i s the main motivator for reform in these countries; each country moves
towards the EU at i t s own pace.
A key element o f the SAP i s a formal contractual relationship in the form o f Stabilization and
Association Agreement (SAA) entailing mutual rights and obligations. The S A A i s signed with
countries that have made sufficient progress in terms o f political and economic reform and
administrative capacity. Once the S A A has been signed and ratified, the country in question
officially becomes a candidate country -the next step in the EU accession ladder.

The SAA foresees the establishment o f a free trade area between candidate countries and the EU by
the end o f a five-year transition period, enhanced cooperation in the economy, environmental
protection, justice and security. The main benefits o f the S A A are:
Economic development through enhanced trade and economic cooperation and the creation
o f a business environment facilitating investments;
Enhanced political stability and security due to good relations with neighbors, regional cooperation and deeper integration into the EU; and
0
Political and economic reforms, including in institution building, public administration
reform, respect o f human rights and the rule o f law.
0

2) Current status o f the SAPISAA process in Bosnia Herzegovina

The EU Council established political and economic conditionality for the development o f bilateral
relations between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1996. At the same time Bosnia and
Herzegovina started to benefit from EU financial assistance for reconstruction efforts after the war.
A feasibility study assessing Bosnia and Herzegovina’s ability to launch S A A negotiations with the
EU was presented by the EU Commission in November 2003. The study specified 16 areas in
which Bosnia and Herzegovina needed to make substantial progress before negotiations could start.
In November 2005 the EU Commission recommended to the EU Council the opening o f SAA
negotiations with BH. Technical talks on the S A A were concluded in December 2006. However,
the report to the EU Council of November 2007 notes that the process can not be formally
concluded due to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s lack o f progress in implementing the necessary
reforms.25

According to the EU, the S A A will be initialed as soon as Bosnia and Herzegovina has made
sufficient progress in addressing key outstanding requirements, notably police restructuring.
Despite several attempts to break the deadlock, agreement has not yet been reached.

’’ European Commission Bosnia and HerzegovinaProgress Report, 6.11.2007

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategyfor FYOI-FYI1

Annex 5

The signature of the S A A will require evidence that the police restructuring i s irreversibly on track,
as well as full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
(ICTY). Progress in the areas of public broadcasting and public administration reform will also be
required before the SAA i s signed. Furthermore, B H needs to address key economic issues, in
particular improve fiscal sustainability through increased revenue collection and efficient control of
expenditure; resolve satisfactorily restitution and internal debt-related issues; establish a framework
favoring private and foreign investment and promote enterprise development.
Top EU and OHR officials have called for a responsible and constructive approach from the
politicians and warned that if the stalemate continues, the European perspective for Bosnia and
Herzegovina will be delayed or even suspended, which would leave the country trailing far behind
the rest of the former Yugoslavia in i t s efforts to integrate with Europe.

3) EU financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina
Despite the absence of a signed SAA the majority of products from Bosnia and Herzegovina can
enter the EU duty-free, thanks to a preferential trade regime adopted in 2000. The regime i s valid
until 2010 in i t s current form. Trade with the EU represents over 50 percent of Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s total trade.
Between 1991 and 2006, the EU has given B H approximately EUR 2.6 billion in financial
assistance. In the immediate post-war years funds were focused on refugee programs and
reconstructionprojects and were distributed through the EU’s humanitarian aid arm ECHO.
Since 2001 Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a beneficiary of the CARDS program, with aid
shifting from post-war assistance to institutional capacity-building and economic development. In
2001-2006, the total EU assistance to Bosnia has been in the region of EUR 600 million. Key
CARDS target areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been public administration reform (including
customs and taxations), issues related to justice and home affairs (police restructuring, border
management, and judicial reform) and improvement of investment climate (including trade,
education, environment and infrastructure).
In order to simplify and harmonize the different external aid components, to facilitate coherence
and improve consistency and to achieve better results, the EU i s currently adopting a new financial
aid mechanism called IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) to replace all previous
external assistance programs for candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkan
region. In i t s current form, P A will cover the period 2007-2013. The overall financial IPA
envelope for Bosnia and Herzegovina amounts to EUR 226 million in 2007-2009. Assistance
under the 2007 IPA program totals EUR 62.1 million. P A will support B H in strengthening the
rule of law, human rights, social inclusion and the protection of minorities. Support will be also
given to the reform of the media sector, public administration improving the functioning of the
judiciary, overcoming high unemployment, and reform the education and public health systems.

Annex 6: Governance Assessment
The Dayton Peace Agreement created a complex institutional structure in Bosnia and Herzegovina
that laid the foundations o f the current governance26environment. This structure was designed to
promote peace and stability, which it has achieved remarkably well, however, it has also had
unintended consequences, such as undermining governments’ efficiency, transparency and
accountability. Complex and opaque institutional structures allow entrenched interests and
informal networks along ethnic, professional and economic interests to thrive.
An international presence under UN auspices has been in place in B H since 1995. The High
Representative has executive powers to impose legislation and remove officials (known as the
“Bonn Powers”), which have been used extensively.
Legislative work in Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s Parliamentary Assembly has been adversely affected by voting along ethnic lines
and insufficient administrative resources. The election of BH’s tripartite Presidency continues to
be in contravention o f European human rights protocols as it does not allow citizens not belonging
to the three constituent people to stand as candidates and determines the ethnicity o f each candidate
elected from the Entities2’. According to the European Commission, on a number o f occasions,
political parties have led negotiations on reform issues for which the government would normally
be responsible2*. Policy-making between the State and the Entities remains fragmented and Statelevel government structures have sometimes been unable to overcome internal conflicts and
gridlocks, which has delayed reform implementation.
Several positive aspects o f governance and recent progress should be noted, including the
functioning o f the supreme audit institutions, adoption of the new law on public procurement, a
free and vibrant press and democratic elections. B H has recently ratified the UN Convention on
Fighting Corruption and a National Anti-Corruption Strategy and action plan was adopted in 2006.
However, implementation o f anti-corruption measures has been slow, due in part to a lack o f
resources. Transparency International’s index o f corruption perception2gfor the past three years
shows a high level o f perceived corruption in BH. Strategic direction and commitment to tackle
the governance agenda in a comprehensive manner appear to be lacking. Strategies and action
plans are in place, but they are not properly implemented.
According to the World Governance Indicators, BH lags behind the averages o f its income group in
several aspects o f governance and behind new EU member states in every aspect. Government
Effectiveness and Regulatory Quality are very low (just above the 25‘h percentile), but have
improved steadily since the end o f the conflict. Voice and Accountability has also improved and i s
now near the midpoint o f countries worldwide. Political Stability and Control o f Corruption remain
at levels found immediately after the war (the former near the 25‘h percentile, the latter just under
the 50thpercentile. Considerable and focused efforts will be needed to prevent B H falling behind
its peers and to bring BH to levels acceptable to the EU.

In the analysis o f governance, B H appears an outlier in ‘state capture’ which i s captured by BEEPS
surveys as: To what extent have unofficial payments to influence a) parliamentary votes; b)
government decrees; c) local government votes and decrees had a direct impact on your business?

The World Bank defines governance as “the manner in which the state acquires and exercises its authority to provide public goods and
services” and corruption as “misuse o f public office for private financial gain.” Corruption i s a result o f poor governance and a failure
o f accountability relationships in the governance system (Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy, 2006)

Annex 6

One possible explanation for this finding i s the need to find balance between the various
constituent peoples in BH. Transparency International (2007) writes, 'a disturbing fact i s that the
key positions in privatization agencies as well as in managing boards in public companies are held
by persons whose most important qualifications are that they belong to a specific political party.'
Obfuscation o f accountability lines and low transparency allow this partial reform status quo to go
unchallenged.
Both citizens3' and business3' consider state capture and dysfunctional and corrupt judiciary as
major obstacles for good governance in the country, as well as revenue systems (tax and customs)
and police. Citizens are also highly dissatisfied with the social benefits system and believe that
education and medical systems are corrupt. A corruption barometer survey conducted by
Transparency International in 2005 finds political parties, parliament, the legal system, police and
customs to be perceived as the most corrupt institutions in BH.
Despite pinpointing the corrupt institutions in society, civil society i s not well organized or strong
in acting as an accountability mechanism to the government. There i s little pressure from civil
society to institute governance reforms. The Council o f Ministers has signed an agreement on
cooperation with the non-government sector. Civil society organizations tend to register at Entity
level and few are therefore active country-wide. The World Bank has supported the Youth Voices
group to engage on policy matters for some years. The Community Development Project with
WBI support facilitates participatory budgeting at the local level.
The Doing Business survey implies that B H i s a difficult environment for private enterprise to
function. Starting a business, registering a property, paying taxes are all much more difficult than
in regional comparator countries. BH's overall rank has fallen in the past two years from 91 in
2005 to 105 in 2007. While there has been no backsliding on reforms, there has been little progress
either and other countries are reforming faster. Again, the ability o f B H to implement reforms i s
hampered by the complex governance structure.
The Bank-supported Business Adjustment Credit has played a significant role in improving the

inspection and business license regime, which has reduced the burden on business. In the next CPS
period, the Bank will support implementationo f BH’s Strategy and Action Plan on enhancing the
corporate financial reporting environment.

EU accession i s one o f the key entry points for the Bank on governance reform in BH. To move
towards EU accession, B H will need to create European administrative space, characterized by i)
distinct separation between politics and administration; ii)clearly set accountability lines for the
professional civil service, iii) clear administrative procedures, iv) solid management control o f
public funds, and v) overall strength o f administrative and judiciary systems in applying and
enforcing these arrangements. To do so will involve B H addressing major governance challenges.
However, current EC governance interventions are concentrated on public administration reform to
prepare the administration for particular tasks relating to EU accession. Other bilateral donors are
also involved in governance-related areas in BH, including: SIDA, USAID and the Netherlands
involvement in the Government Accountability Project; USAID’s support for the Center for
Investigative Journalism and tax administration reform; and DFID, SIDA and the Netherlands
collaboration on public Administrative Reform.
In applying the Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption strategy in B H during this CPS, the World
Bank will identify sectors where governance reforms are possible and visible so as to create a
demonstration effect, while also stimulating demand for good governance through local level
accountability interventions and strategic communication. The Bank will work with the
international community to agree on the key principles and priorities for supporting governance
efforts in BH. As governance reform i s not explicitly part o f the governments’ agenda, the Bank
will approach reform directly through sectoral initiatives in the core lending program and through
advocacy and communications in the non-core part o f the program.

Annex 7

Annex 7: Private Sector Annex
Key opportunities and challenges

BH i s making steady progress in i t s economic recovery from an aid-dependent to a selfsustaining economy. Economic expansion and growth have remained robust over the last few
years, despite slow reform implementation. However, much remains to be done in order to
achieve long-term, sustainable, private-sector led growth.

The private sector’s contribution to GDP stands at 55 percent in BH, which i s below regional
averages. Serbia had an equivalent private sector contribution to GDP in 2005, Croatia’s 60
percent and FYR Macedonia’s 65 percent are relatively close, but Bulgaria and Poland with 75
percent or Hungary and the Czech Republic’s 80 percent o f GDP produced by private sector are
far ahead. The current high share o f public expenditure to GDP i s crowding out private sector.
Privatization, restructuring and bankruptcy

According to the 2007 WBG enterprise survey, there were some 34,000 companies registered
in BH in 2005, with a further 800 yet to be privatized (of which, some 130 are strategic
companies). In 1999, the Government adopted a voucher privatization program, supported by
the international community, resulting in large numbers o f privatized SMEs. However, the
program resulted in fragmented ownership and did not introduce new management or new
capital. Many o f these companies need further restructuring to make them commercially viable
and to make them attractive to private buyers. Public and private companies alike have poor
and deteriorating business performance. Productivity and capacity utilization i s relatively low,
export levels are still significantly below that o f imports and many companies are indebted.
Privatization and corporate restructuring are urgently needed to release the productive assets
tied up in these companies into the economy.
Some key strategic companies s t i l l awaiting privatization are the large utilities, including
power, telecommunication, railways etc. In addition to restructuring, successful privatization
w i l l also require sound legal and regulatory frameworks, tariff reform and improved corporate
governance. The private sector should also be encouraged to participate in major infrastructure
investments through public-private partnerships.
Financial sector

Reforms o f the banking sector have advanced reasonably well, compared to other sectors. The
banking sector i s now majority private- and foreign-owned. However, progress in advancing
non-bank privatization has been slow, particularly in the Federation. A consolidation o f the
banking sector might be appropriate.
Business Environment

The business environment in BH i s not perceived to be conductive for investment, due to: a
small and fragmented market; fragmented ownership structures; the slow pace o f privatization;
and perceived risks o f regional instability. As part o f the former Yugoslavia, B H specialized in
raw materials, semi-finished products, heavy industry and energy production. The drivers of
export growth are food processing, base metals, textiles, wood and chemicals.
Creating an investor-friendly business environment and attracting F D I will be o f particular
importance given the large trade and current account deficits. Some progress has been made
through the last CAS period. First stage reforms have been completed or are being

83

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYOI-FYI 1

Annex 7

implemented, including, but not limited to: improved access to financing through a pledge
registry (BH i s ranked 13” on “Getting Credit” indicator, due to the reforms done in this
sector); modern and transparent bankruptcy system that improved the bankruptcy process;
reform o f the inspection regime that reduced the burden on business and improved the
efficiency and effectiveness of inspections (the Bank’s own survey showed that the inspections
reform succeeded in bringing down the average number of inspection days per company to less
than 9 days countrywide);.a new business registration system that already influenced some
reduction in number of days and aims to further reduce the number of days required to register
a business; strengthening of the legal framework for financial sector, in particular insurance and
banking.
Overall, the business environment improved somewhat, but more remains to be done. There i s
an urgent need to speed up the pace of the reforms. With little reform changes recorded in the
Doing Business reports, BH’s relative rank in the Ease of Doing Business table has stagnated
(ranking unchanged at 150) as other countries’ reforms outpace those in BH. BH made
im rovements in the category “Trading across Borders”, where the ranking improving from
67 to 53rd place i s due to continued improvement in facilitation o f cross-border flow of goods.
But the report also identified problems with licensing, where BH i s ranked very low.

IR

BH should now move to second-stage reforms including: strengthening bankruptcy courts and
capital markets; reforming licenses and permits; and reviewing and rationalizingdifferent taxes
and levies imposed on businesses by various levels of government. BH has to be able to attract
more “brown-field” investment in order to fuel private sector growth. To do so, stronger and
more regulated capital markets and better corporate governance are needed.

SMEs
According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) 2005 report,
B H i s at the bottom o f South-East Europe (SEE) countries together with Serbia in fueling
private sector development through strong SME growth. SMEs are likely to be the vehicle for
short-term growth and employment. The introduction o f VAT in 2006 has helped to formalize
many small businesses.
Labor market

BH has high levels o f unemployment and a low labor force participation rate. High taxes on
wages raise the cost of formal sector employment, resulting in a large (perhaps one third of all
jobs) informal sector. Wage-bargaining mechanisms are figid, contributing to low job creation
and low worker mobility. Labor mobility i s further hindered by the lack of harmonization of
labor policies between the two Entities.
Modernized and harmonized corporate (CIT) and personal income tax (PIT) laws were enacted
in 2006 in the RS and in late 2007 in the Federation, setting the CIT rate at 10 percent and the
PIT rates at 10 percent and 15 percent. This represents a major improvement over previous
legislationand should help to start improving the demand for labor.
In summary, BH i s faced with the following challenges in promoting sustainable private sectorled growth:
A small and fragmented market;
Serious indebtedness and low capacity utilization o f enterprises, which seriously
undermines real-sector competitiveness and corporate governance in the country;

84

Bosnia and Herzegovina Country Partnership Strategy for FYO8-FYI1

0

Annex 7

Enterprise assets that are not being released into productive use; this could be done
either through privatization, restructuring or bankruptcy;
Incomplete institutional and legal frameworks to promote private sector participation in
infrastructure and to select investors through transparent, open and competitive
processes;
Poor corporate governance in the real sector, in particular lack o f ownership
concentration in voucher-privatized enterprises;
A financial sector, which needs to be streamlined, strengthened and unified, including
leasing, insurance, banking and financial markets; and
Regulatory burdens on business operations (such as non-harmonized taxes, extensive
time/cost/processing for obtaining certain permits and licenses, lengthy court
enforcement time);
Labor market rigidities and social pressures stemming from any adverse side-effects o f
large scale restructuring o f enterprises.

The World Bank Group’s role

The World Bank Group provides assistance on several o f the challenges identified above.
Through the last CAS period, the Bank supported a Business Enabling Environment Credit
(BAC) that yielded several notable results, including improved access to finance, faster
bankruptcy and a more efficient inspection regime.
However, another adjustment credit that focused on corporate restructuring was dropped due to
a lack o f commitment by the authorities. In this CPS period, an Enterprise Restructuring Grant
from the European Union, administered by the Bank, w i l l aim to move the corporate
restructuring agenda forward with a restructuring o f over a dozen Voucher-Privatized
Enterprises and will pave the way for further corporate restructuring. In response to stated
demand, technical assistance by the Bank will also be provided to strengthen financial markets,
as well as to insurance sector. W B I and the Bank are cooperating on a joint project which
promotes private sector led-growth through focusing on ICT and competitiveness.
Bank projects on labor redeployment and assistance to labor and social sectors can help to
alleviate some problems in these sectors. Instances o f such activities could involve dealing
with the existing pool o f ‘fictitious’ or ‘waitlisted’ workers and implement measures that would
systematically resolve this issue in a financially prudent manner that does not create imbalances
elsewhere in the economy. Similarly, the Bank could support efforts to reform the system o f
payroll contributions to strengthen both supply and demand-side incentives in the labor market.

The World Bank Group anticipates playing an important role helping the government to
structure possible PPP transactions. During FY07, the Bank held a training seminar on PPPs
that was very well attended by a cross-section o f regulators and officials from BH. Follow-up
activity has been requested and will be implemented through the CPS period. In addition, IFC
i s seeking opportunities to support private companies that would consider investing in the
infrastructure through long term financing, including PPP in the road and energy sectors. In
addition, FIASIIFC’s advisory services will continue to focus in 4 business lines: SMEs and
linkages; business enabling environment; access to finance; and infrastructure advisory
operations. In particular, sub-national competitiveness will focus on reducing burden to
business in terms o f obtaining some permits and licenses, while Alternative Dispute Resolution
(ADR) program will somewhat address the stock o f outstanding disputes, thereby releasing
additional capital for investment.
