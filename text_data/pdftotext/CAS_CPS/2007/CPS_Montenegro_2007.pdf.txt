COUNTRYPARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR
REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.
Background. Montenegro has made significant strides in the past year, becoming
independent in June 2006, and initialing a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with
the European Commission in March 2007. Recent gains have built on a solid record o f transition
and reform over the past decade, and since the conclusion o f regional conflicts during the 1990s.
Montenegro has successfully laid the foundations for a market based economy, strengthened
democratic institutions, and gradually built capacity in public administration to cope with
political and economic transformation. These efforts have restored macro-economic stability,
and encouraged a rapid increase in growth, which i s now the strongest in the Western Balkans.
Nonetheless, further reform efforts will be required to ensure that there is a soft-landing to the
current economic boom, and to continue to move toward full integration with Europe.

..

EU Accession. Eventual membership o f the EU is Montenegro’s central priority. The
signing o f the S A A was the first formal step in the accession process. European Foreign
Ministers have reiterated that Montenegro has a European perspective, although the pace o f
progress will depend not only on Montenegro’s ability to harmonize with European standards but
o n the EU’s absorptive capacity. Particular challenges for Montenegro identified by the E C
include: (i)
reinforcing democratic institutions, including adopting a Constitution in line with
European standards; (ii)
comprehensive reforms to harmonize policies and legislation; and (iii)
strengthening limited administrative capacity to implement legal and regulatory framework.
11.

iii. The World Bank Group has actively supported Montenegro’s transition since 2001.
While Montenegro joined the World Bank Group only in January 2007, the Bank has had a
discrete program o f lending and analytical work for Montenegro for most o f the period since
Serbia and Montenegro became a member in 2001. Total IDA credits committed to Montenegro
during this period amount to almost SDR 60 million (roughly U S D 90 million). As well as IDA
support, the Bank Group provided technical assistance from both I F C and MIGA to improve the
business environment, while I F C continues to hold financial sector investments in Montenegro.
Bank Group support, including both financing and advisory services, has assisted the
Government to undertake reform to encourage strong private sector led growth (incomes over
this period have almost doubled in U S D terms to just over $3,900 in 2006). Bank support has
also helped the Authorities to streamline public expenditure while maintaining or improving
service quality in key sectors such as health and education, and helped to ensure that some
inroads have been made in reducing persistent poverty, although real gains o n this front appear to
have only been relatively recent.
iv.
The new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). This first CPS for Montenegro outlines
potential assistance across the Bank Group. Bank Group programs will be mutually reinforcing
and complementary. Interventions from IDA/IBRD, I F C and MIGA will also be coordinated
closely and are expected to have strong synergies - although it also needs to be recognized that
I F C and MIGA are to some degree driven by private sector demand. The strategy i s designed to
coincide with the political cycle in Montenegro and support the Government formed in

i

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

November 2006 through i t s four-year term. Within the over-arching framework o f European
integration, the CPS reflects the Government’s three identified key priorities:
0

0

enhancing sustainable economic growth, through increasing economic freedoms and
strengthening the role o f the private sector;
building institutions and the rule o f law; and
improving the standard o f living o f citizens, through efficient education, health and
social protection systems.

A focused program o f investment operations i s planned. This strategy will mark
Montenegro’s graduation from IDA to IBRD lending. In total, $19 million in IDA lending i s
planned in FY07. This will fully utilize the IDA allocation envisaged for Montenegro in outlined
for FY05 to FY07 in the CAS for Serbia and Montenegro discussed by the Board in late 2004.
Given improvements in creditworthiness, new IBRD lending o f $50 million over the three year
period from FY08 to FYlO i s anticipated in the base case scenario. IBRD financing i s expected
to focus o n supporting the Authorities to put in place systems and structures to strengthen
environmental management; move toward compliance with European standards; access potential
E C regional and rural development funds - particularly for the poorer northern regions - should
Montenegro become a candidate country in future; strengthen the cadastral agency and
streamline municipal licensing and permits for businesses; and continue to strengthen social
service delivery. Additional financing may also be offered to support transport sector
investments , should Montenegro’s creditworthiness continue to improve, and subject to W h e r
efforts by the Government to ensure that the significant benefits o f public-private partnerships
for infrastructure are also managed with due respect for the significant r i s k s that are also
involved. In total, the portfolio i s expected to decline to a steady state o f about four activities.
v.

Partnerships. The Bank Group will work closely in partnership with the authorities and
other members o f the international community. Given the over-arching role o f the EU, all
programs will take European standards into account. Specific rural and regional development
investments will also be undertaken in close coordination with the EC. The Bank i s also
working closely with the IMF. Montenegro is currently considering an IMF program in order to
gain the imprimatur o f good economic management. Given the importance o f structural issues
such as the energy sector and greater labor market reform to Montenegro’s long-term macroeconomic situation, Bank analytical support for the IMF provides an opportunity to take forward
discussion in these areas, particularly given the limited need for World Bank development policy
lending. The Bank also continues to work closely with the range o f bilateral donors active in
Montenegro.
vi.

Risks. The program i s designed to mitigate risks that could limit the effectiveness o f
Bank interventions and impede achievement o f outcomes. Risks are particularly associated with
the scope for regional instability, the possibility o f Montenegro suffering a “hard landing”, and
the potential for limited capacity to adversely affect portfolio performance. Strong political
commitment to EU integration throughout the region may help to mitigate risks, although
Montenegrin Government commitment to pursue needed but sensitive reform will also be
required. The Bank will be prepared to respond flexibly to circumstances. An enhanced Bank
presence in Montenegro will also support even stronger engagement in portfolio management
and policy dialogue.
vii.

viii.
Issues for discussion by the Board. Guidance from the Board would be appreciated on
the overall direction proposed for the CPS including, inter alia:
0

Are the proposed mix o f interventions, including lending, analytical work, possible
investments and guarantees for the private sector, and partnerships with other
members o f the international community (particularly the EU and the IMF)
appropriately structured to allow the Bank Group to best use i t s comparative
advantages to support Montenegro’s priorities?

0

I s the proposed high case focus o n transport investments linked to improved
creditworthiness a strengthened framework for managing concessions and publicprivate partnerships appropriate?

0

I s the CPS sufficiently flexible to allow the Bank Group both to respond to risks, and
to remain relevant in a rapidly changing environment?

OF IDA, IBRD AND IFC
COUNTRYPARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Montenegro has made significant strides in the past year, becoming independent in
June 2006 and initialing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in March
2007. Recent gains have built on a solid record o f transition and reform over the past decade,
and since the conclusion o f regional conflicts during the 1990s. Montenegro has successfully
laid the foundations for a market based economy, strengthened democratic institutions, and
gradually built capacity in public administration to cope with political and economic
transformation. These efforts have restored macro-economic stability, and encouraged a rapid
increase in growth, which is now the strongest in the Western Balkans. Nonetheless, further
reform efforts will be required to ensure that there i s a soft-landing to the current economic
boom, and to continue to move toward full integration with Europe.

2. The proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on the experience of the
World Bank Group’ in Montenegro since 2002. While Montenegro joined the World Bank
Group only in January 2007, the Bank has had a discrete program o f lending and analytical work
for Montenegro for most o f the period since Serbia and Montenegro became a member in 2001.
The CPS aims to hamess the contributions o f all parts o f the World Bank Group, including I F C
and MIGA, to support Montenegro build on the progress o f the past few years. The CPS will
also mark Montenegro’s graduation from IDA to IBRD financing. The CPS aims to assist the
Montenegrin Government’s over-arching strategic goal o f integration with the European Union.
Within this framework, the CPS will be focused around the Government’s three key priorities*:
(i)enhancing sustainable economic growth, through increasing economic freedoms and
strengthening the role o f the private sector; (ii)
building institutions and the rule o f law; and (iii)
improving the standard o f living o f citizens, through efficient education, health and social
protection systems.
11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A. Political Background and Recent Developments

3. Montenegro officially declared independence on June 3, 2006. This followed a
referendum in May, 2006, as allowed under the Belgrade Agreement, o n which the State Union
o f Serbia and Montenegro was established in 2003. Nationally, the pro-independence vote
slightly exceeded the agreed threshold o f 55 percent required for the success o f the referendum.

for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Parliament, and the Council o f
Europe Parliamentary Assembly, concluded that the referendum “provided a genuine opportunity
for Montenegrin voters to determine their future” and that “overall, the referendum was
conducted in line with OSCE and other international standard~”~. Referendum results were
widely accepted internationally.
4. A degree o f continuity in Government policy can be expected over the coming four year
Parliamentary session. Montenegro conducted Parliamentary and municipal elections
(elections were held in 14 out o f 21 municipalities) in October 2006. At the national level, the
governing and pro-independence coalition o f the Democratic Party o f Socialists (DPS) and the
-Social Democratic Party (SDP) won a majority o f 41 seats in the 81-seat Parliament. The same
coalition w o n in 11 out o f the 14 municipalities at the local election. The other party gaining a
significant number o f Parliamentary seats in the elections was the economically liberal
Movement for Change (PZP). Following elections, former Prime Minister Djukanovic stepped
down as Prime Minister, and was replaced by former Minister o f Justice Sturanovic. The new
Government has moved to streamline machinery o f government arrangements.
5. The Government, with strong popular support, i s making progress toward European
integration. Montenegrin Prime Minister Sturanovic initialed a Stabilization and Association
Agreement (SAA) in March 2007 with European Commissioner for Enlargement Rehn. This i s
the first formal step in the EU accession process. With this, Montenegro has joined Albania in
the S A A process and i s only a step behind neighbors such as Croatia and FYR Macedonia, which
have been granted candidacy status. Following Montenegro’s independence, the Austrian EU
Presidency reiterated that Montenegro’s future, as with all the Western Balkans countries, i s
within the EU, in line with principles laid down by EU Foreign Ministers at the Thessaloniki
Summit. Nevertheless, Ministers also stressed in Salzburg in March 2006 that the European
perspective for all o f the countries in the region needs to be considered in light o f the EU’s
absorption capacity. Particular challenges for Montenegro identified by the E C include: (i)
reinforcing democratic institutions, including adopting a Constitution in line with European
standards; (ii)comprehensive reforms to harmonize policies and legislation; and (iii)
strengthening limited administrative capacity to implement legal and regulatory framework.

6. Montenegro became a member of the World Bank Group on January 18, 2007,
immediately following membership in the IMF.
7. The Government recognizes that inclusion efforts will be required. Despite the success
o f the referendum, voting patterns suggest that the electorate i s to some extent split across
regional lines. Many o f the population identifying themselves as ethnic Serbs, particularly in the
poorer northern region o f the country, remain skeptical o f the benefits o f independence. The
adoption o f a Constitution that gives appropriate recognition to minority rights in line with
European standards will be important to ensure that the range o f minority groups in Montenegro
feel included in the new state. The Government anticipates that a Constitution will be in place in
late 2007, although the drafting process has proven protracted, and the ratification process has
not yet been determined.

8. Encouraging greater inclusion will be especially important given risks o f regional
instability. Negotiations o n Kosovo’s status are, perhaps inevitably, proving highly sensitive.
Although clarity on this issue i s potentially important for longer-term regional stability, the
determination o f KOSOVO~S
status has significant potential to exacerbate nationalist tendencies
throughout the region. Montenegro i s to some extent a little more insulated than other countries
in the region where ethnic and political differences are more pronounced, as a result o f history
and conflicts during the 1990s and the early 2000s. But no country in the region i s likely to be
completely immune. Depending on the outcomes o f Kosovo negotiations, there i s also potential
for movements o f people into northern Montenegro that will need to be carefully managed and
may test both Montenegro’s capacity to respond and willingness to accept displaced people.

B. Recent Economic Developments
9. Montenegro i s a small, open, middle-income economy. Total GDP is approximately $2.4
billion. GDP per capita o f just under $3,900 is comparable to or higher than other Western
Balkan countries. Still, per capita incomes remain well below recent EU members except for
Bulgaria. The economy is open, with total trade making up approximately 130 percent o f GDP.
Montenegro i s in the process o f joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), and has joined the
Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), which was expanded in late 2006 to include the
countries o f South East Europe, and which guarantees free trade for approximately 90 percent o f
industrial products. Reflecting its small size, the economy i s very narrowly based. Services
make up about 60 percent o f economic activity. Although only making up perhaps a quarter o f
the services sector, tourism i s a key component o f the economy, and a major source for growth,
especially along the Adriatic coast. Manufacturing, particularly the aluminum industry, makes
up about a quarter o f the total economy, and over h a l f o f exports. Agriculture comprises about
15 percent o f the economy. Agriculture is, however, a significant source o f income for many
people in the poorer northern regions o f the country.

10. The Montenegrin economy has recently started to grow strongly, following a weaker
performance in the early part of the decade. Over the past five years, growth has picked up
from 2 percent to 6.5 percent in 2006 (figure 2). Montenegro is currently the fastest growing o f
all the Western Balkan countries, although growth has not matched the strong performance o f the
very fast growing Baltic states. Recent growth has been driven by very strong foreign
investment, particularly in the tourism and real estate sectors. Montenegro is among the fastest
growing tourism markets in the world.
Nevertheless, significant efforts to maintain
Montenegro’s natural environmental beauty will be critical to ensure continued growth in this
sector. Montenegro has also benefited from strong global demand for metals, reflected in
aluminum prices.

11. Strong economic performance has been underpinned by the restoration of macroeconomic stability. Regional conflicts during the 1990s crippled the economy, and delayed the
start o f the transition process. Since 1997, however, Montenegro has embarked o n an ambitious
program o f macro-economic stabilization and market-oriented structural reforms. Although the
agenda remains incomplete, significant progress has been made.
12. Monetary policy has been anchored by the “Euroization” o f the economy. Inflation has
fallen from over 20 percent in the late 1990s, to approximately 2 percent in 2006. While credit
growth has been very high, this has been from a l o w base (private sector credit i s equivalent to
just over 40 percent o f GDP) and has been financed from growing domestic deposits rather than

4

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

foreign borrowing.
policies.

The Central Bank has generally applied appropriately strict prudential

13. The Government has pursued conservative fiscal policies, with the overall fiscal
balance moving from a deficit o f 5 percent o f GDP in 2003 to a surplus of 3 percent o f GDP
in 2006. The fiscal resolve o f the Authorities i s reflected in the fact that such a surplus was
achieved despite inevitable spending pressures during the referendum and subsequent
Parliamentary election. At a time when Montenegro i s in the midst o f a cyclical upswing,
however, surpluses should be expected. I t will be important that fiscal discipline i s maintained.
Efforts to improve fiscal data and control for state owned enterprises and municipalities will be
required. Government efforts to resolve restitution claims in a fiscally sustainable fashion will
also be critical to ensure that fiscal discipline can be maintained.
14. Despite prudent macro-economic policies, some signs are emerging that the economy
may be starting to overheat. Asset prices have soared. Real estate prices have increased
dramatically, and partial data suggests prices in tourist areas are already comparable to those in
Croatia. Similarly, the market capitalization o f both Montenegrin stock exchanges has jumped
extremely rapidly over the past few years. After weak growth in formal employment for several
years, the unemployment rate declined significantly in 2006 from about 19 percent to about 14
percent. Correlated with the decline in unemployment, rapid wage growth is perhaps the clearest
sign that strains are increasing. Across the economy, wages grew by 16 percent in 2006, and
have clearly outstripped productivity gains for several years. Wage growth i s most evident in the
construction, tourism and energy sectors. Public sector wage restraint has been lax, with raises
close to those across the economy as a whole - although strong growth and some layoffs have
still ensured that the total public sector wage bill has been reduced from slightly over 13 percent
o f GDP in 2003 to about 11 percent o f GDP in 2006.
15. The strong economic upswing i s especially evident in a widening current account
deficit. Yet while the current account deficit reached almost 29 percent o f GDP in 2006, this
should not necessarily b e a cause for undue alarm. Large current deficits are not unusual for
small, open economies during boom periods. Notably, Montenegro’s current account is fblly
fhded, and appears largely driven by foreign direct investment equivalent to over 34 percent o f
GDP. Very high investment, particularly in construction, has sucked in imports, while the
wealth effects o f real estate investment has encouraged high domestic demand. The Euroization
o f the economy also removes risks o f a currency crisis, although with the corollary that any sharp
decline in foreign investment will directly impact o n growth.
C. Poverty

16. Poverty in Montenegro appears limited, but remains a persistent problem. Annual
living standard measurement surveys (LSMS) in Montenegro between the period 2002 and 2004
suggest that between 9 and 12 percent o f the population live in poverty. Figures suggest that
4

As is standard in most Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries, t h i s is based o n a poverty line o f $2 per day in
2000 prices. The use o f the $2 figure reflects increased heating and other costs associated with cold weather
climates.

5

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

poverty has remained relatively stable over the period. Data from a 2005 household budget
survey (HBS) i s currently being analyzed. Poverty also appears relatively shallow, with an
average consumption deficit o f those living in poverty varying between 14 and 20 percent o f the
poverty line. On the other hand, a larger percentage o f the population is vulnerable to shocks; a
20 percent increase in the poverty line would double the number o f people considered to be
living in poverty.
17. Strong 2006 growth and job creation suggests that some further reductions in poverty
can be anticipated, but growth alone i s unlikely to assist all of those in poverty. To date,
growth has been concentrated particularly along the coast. Growth in the poorer northern
municipalities, where up to 20 percent o f the population lives in poverty, has been more limited.
The incidence o f poverty i s also especially high in many groups that have fewer opportunities to
f i l l y participate in and benefit from growth: the Roma population, those with only primary
education, and rural households. Analysis suggests that, without transfer payments, poverty in
Montenegro would increase by approximately one third. The Montenegro Government is
currently preparing a revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which will support the
Government’s overarching EU accession strategy as w e l l as a broad Economic Reform Agenda
2007-1 1, which is anticipated will be completed in 2007.
D. Governance Issues

18. Good governance across a broad spectrum of policy, administrative and institutional
dimensions i s now widely recognized as a key factor in attracting investment, increasing
growth, and reducing poverty. Partly given the history o f smuggling through Montenegro
during the upheavals in the Balkans during the 1 9 9 0 ~corruption
~
i s widely perceived as a
problem.
19. The Government has undertaken a wide range of recent reforms to improve
governance. Montenegro has adopted the Stability Pact Anti-Comption Initiative (SPAI)
Compact and Action Plan; and strengthened the legal framework through the adoption o f the
Public Procurement A c t (2001), a criminal code (2004), a L a w on Money Laundering (2004), a
L a w on Conflict o f Interest (2005), which requires high-ranking state officials to report their
assets before taking office, and a new Public Procurement L a w (2006). The government has also
set up several independent bodies in an effort to reduce corruption, including: an Anti-Corruption
Initiative Agency to promote transparency and integrity in government, the State Revision
Institute, the Unit for the Fight against Organized Crime, the Commission for Observing the
Privatization Process, the Office o f the Ombudsman, and the Commission for Public
Procurement. Particularly notable among recent efforts i s the streamlining o f customs
administration: a June 2006 survey conducted by the Bank indicates that significant progress has
taken place from 2002 to 2006. Customs users’ ratings in all categories (transparency, equality,
standardization o f procedures, ability to lodge a complaint) improved markedly, and overall
corruption in Montenegro customs was assessed by respondents as low-medium [2.26 o n a 1
(good) to 5 (poor) scale].
20. But additional efforts to improve the enforcement governance related legislation will be
required. Despite considerable legislative reform, enforcement remains limited. Vigorous

6

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

efforts to implement the new legislative framework and build institutional capacity will be
needed. An EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) shows that corruption continues to be a problem for doing business in Montenegro, as
it i s throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The latest BEEPS survey, from 2005, must be
treated with some caution as results from Serbia and Montenegro are combined. The results
suggest, however, that corruption in Serbia and Montenegro i s broadly comparable to that in the
rest o f the Western Balkans. Nevertheless, a marked increase in the overall number o f f i r m s
reporting that corruption is a problem doing business in S a M (from just over 30 percent in 2002
to about 50 percent in 2005) reinforces the need for constant vigilance. Data on Montenegro is
limited, with only 18 o f the 250 f i r m s surveyed being from Montenegro. Results from this very
small sample, however, suggest that trends in Montenegro appear to be broadly consistent with
those in SaM. The frequency o f reported bribes i s common, although the overall cost and impact
on firms’ operations appears slightly less than for SaM as a whole. Montenegro specific surveys
will be conducted in the next round o f BEEPS, expected in 2008. The Montenegrin
Government’s own Anti-Corruption Initiative Agency will also be undertaking analytical work
in this regard.
1II.MONTENEGRO’S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, VISION AND PRIORITIES

A. Montenegro’s Economic Outlook

21. The near-term economic outlook for Montenegro i s highly favorable. IMF estimates
suggest that growth could accelerate to 7.5 percent in 2007, before gradually slowing to about 5
percent (Figure 4). Growth is likely to be driven primarily by a continued expansion in tourism.
Reports from the World Tourism Organization and operators are optimistic, with major tourism
investments - such as the recent agreement to refurbish Sveti Stefan - expected to come on
stream over the next few years. Continued strong global metals demand should also help to
underpin growth, although assumptions are based o n a gradual decline in the aluminum price.

22. Over the medium-term, growth i s prqjected to moderate to a still stron but m
sustainable level as the current FDI boom unwinds gradually. Over time, IMF and
Government estimates suggest that exports are projected to gradually become the main source o f

7

growth (reflecting the export focus o f much current FDI), with the current account deficit and
large FDI both declining in tandem.

23. While a “soft landing” i s likely, continued prudent macro-economic policies and
renewed structural reform efforts would help to reduce risks. The Government has made
significant progress in the past five years in efforts to create a business friendly, open economy
with l o w taxes and minimal state interference. But the unfinished reform agenda remains
substantial. A “soft landing” scenario presumes a continued consolidation o f Government
finances, and a bold push o n structural reforms.
B.

Montenegro’s Long-term Vision and Policy Priorities

24. The over-arching strategic goal for the new Government i s Euro-Atlantic integration,
particularly greater integration with the European Union. Within this framework, the
Government has identified three key priorities5:

(i) enhancing sustainable economic growth, through increasing economic freedoms and
strengthening the role o f the private sector;
(ii)building institutions and the r u l e o f law; and
(iii)improving the standard o f living o f citizens, through efficient education, health and
social protection systems.
25. Overall Government policy i s set out in the EU Stabilization and Association program
and a new Economic Reform Agenda 2007-11, currently being prepared to replace the
previous 2002-07 plan. A new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) i s under development
by the Ministry o f Health, Labor and Social Welfare to support these broader plans, and a range
o f sector strategies and plans are in place or being prepared. Linking these strategies with a
Economic Policy of Montenegro for 2007: Government o f Montenegro, December 2006.

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-I 0

strengthened medium-term expenditure framework and the annual budgetary process, however,
presents a continuing challenge.
1.

Enhancing Sustainable Economic Growth

26. I n order to encourage growth, the Authorities intend to consolidate further the size of
Government. The size o f the public sector in Montenegro has declined f r o m 45 percent o f GDP
in 2003, but still remains relatively large, with expenditures just under 42 percent o f G D P although this does not take into account a large informal economy estimated at approximately 30
percent o f GDP. The Authorities have a stated commitment to further reduce the economic drag
o f the public sector, and to reduce overall public debt from 40 percent to 30 percent o f GDP by
2012. In order to encourage investment and growth, the Government reduced the personal
income tax rate in 2007 to 15 percent, and i s reviewing some labor and other taxes. At the same
time, the Government i s anticipating an increase in capital spending, particularly to improve
transport links and road maintenance. Recurrent expenditures currently make up a very
significant portion o f total spending.
27. Additional reductions in current outlays will be required to meet Government policy
priorities, while maintaining a prudent fiscal position. A fiscal surplus o f 3 percent, as
achieved during 2006, appears broadly appropriate at this stage o f the economic cycle. I f a
prudent fiscal position i s to be maintained at the same time that other p o l i c y goals are met, the
Government will need to consider carefully the scope for savings on recurrent expenditures. In
particular, a lid will need to be kept o n public sector wage growth, which averaged 16 percent in
2006, and which the Government is anticipating could increase by a further 10 percent in 2007.
Ultimately continued wage growth o f this magnitude has the strong potential to put other policy
goals at risk. Restraint on .recurrent expenditures and wages will also b e crucial to allow the
fiscal space for the Authorities to deal with restitution claims in a fiscally sustainable manner,
and to strengthen capacity to implement EU standards.
28. Effective planning, landscape and watershed management, and environmental
investments will be key for the sustainable development o f the higher end tourism market.
The Government, with support from donors, is moving to harmonize the L a w on Environment
with EU standards and regulations. The Government i s also developing a Spatial Plan for the
Republic o f Montenegro to 2020, a Tourism Development Strategy t o 2020, and National
Strategies for the Sustainable Development o f Montenegro and for the Integrated Management o f
Coastal Areas o f Montenegro. The Government also ratified the Kyoto Protocol in March 2007.
Strong political commitment will be required, however, for effective enforcement o f
environmental legislation and plans. Improving the sustainable management o f the environment
will particularly require further strengthening o f institutional capacity, and greater efforts by
municipalities to reach agreement on the location o f shared solid waste and waste water
treatment sites than has been demonstrated to date. Significant environment investments will
also be required to overcome air, water and soil pollution by a few large “hotspot” industries,
currently poor waste and water management, and unsustainable natural resource and coastal zone
management.

9

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

29. Further privatization o f state-owned enterprises could help to improve economic
performance, and provide an opportunity for the Government to raise further revenues to
reduce debt. Montenegro has made considerable strides in privatizing state owned enterprises
in recent years: the sale in 2005 o f Montenegro telecom, the Aluminum plant (KAP), Podgoricka
Banka and a range o f other companies generated receipts o f approximately Euro 200 million, and
almost the same again in commitments for further investment. Remaining companies include,
inter alia, Montenegro Airlines, residual financial sector holdings, Plantaze wines, shipyards and
the Port o f Bar.
30. The Government recognizes that reform of the energy sector i s the key remaining issue
in terms o f reforming state-owned enterprises. Continued energy sector reform will be
especially important given the importance o f this sector in economic activity. Montenegro
currently imports approximately one third o f i t s power needs. The power supply situation in
Montenegro, as with much o f the Western Balkans and Europe more generally, i s anticipated to
tighten significantly. Significant capacity additions will be required, and are consistent with the
least cost generation study supported by the World Bank and the EC, as will generation and
transmission investments. While electricity demand i s growing fast, production i s hampered by
old structures, limited investment, and the running down o f assets in the state-owned electricity
company, EPCG. EPCG has reported annual losses o f about 1 percent o f GDP since 2002.
Participation in the South East Europe regional energy market offers considerable potential for
Montenegro. This will, however, require further market oriented reforms; including giving
scope to the independent regulator to establish tariff prices that cover costs and which minimize
cross-subsidies between different groups. In particularly, tariffs for residential consumers and
for the very largest industrial consumers, such as the recently privatized aluminum plant KAP,
will need to continue to increase. In addition, required tariff increases will also require welltargeted and adequately funded offsetting social safety net programs to minimize the impact on
the poor. The unbundling o f energy generation, transmission, and distribution components o f
EPCG, the privatization o f distribution assets, and the further commercialization or privatization
o f generation assets will also be important to encourage new private investment, and to
encourage the efficient functioning o f the regional market. Improved energy efficiency, in both
the public and private sectors, will be needed to reduce demand.

31. Renewed efforts to improve labor market flexibility will be needed to ensure
Montenegro remains competitive. Despite reforms to the Labor L a w in 2003, Montenegro’s
labor market remains characterized by excessive employment protection, a relatively high tax
wedge, and l o w wage flexibility. Rigidities result from the legacy o f the “self-management”
system for enterprises common throughout the former Yugoslav countries. The perceived
rigidity o f labor laws i s a key reason for a relatively large informal sector. Although labor
market reform tends to be politically sensitive in all countries, there appears to be a window o f
opportunity to tackle these issues following independence and during the current upswing. Such
reform will help to ensure that Montenegro is able to remain competitive, and that the economy
will be able to respond flexibly once current strong growth cools. Greater flexibility will also be
important as the Euroization o f the economy, while bringing macro-stability, restricts scope to
maintain competitiveness through exchange rate policies.

10

County Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

ii. Building Institutions and the Rule of Law

32. Perhaps inevitably given the relatively small size of the country, the capacity o f the
public administration i s limited. The Government recognizes the need to modernize public
administration, and the recent consolidation o f ministries at the time the new Government came
to power in late 2006 demonstrates a degree o f commitment. Further efforts to strengthen the
central C i v i l Service Agency and to link pay to performance will be essential. The Government
will need to focus particularly on strengthening the capacity o f public institutions critical for the
EU accession process, such as intellectual property rights, standardization and accreditation,
to improve
national statistics, border management and customs. Other key priorities will be: (i)
the implementation o f business regulations, particularly at the municipal level, and; (ii)to
continue to push ahead with efforts to improve overall governance, including procurement
reform and, perhaps most importantly, management o f very large public-private partnerships and
concessions.
33. There have been significant improvements in the business environment in Montenegro
over the past few years, but more could be done. The Bank’s Doing Business survey for 2006
indicated that Serbia and Montenegro was one o f the top reform performers durilig 2005:
reducing business registration from 5 1 to 15 days by moving registration for business start-ups
from the courts to a new administrative registry; and halving the time to enforce a simple
contract in the courts. The latest survey, from 2007, which provides Montenegro specific data,
suggests that the ease o f doing business in Montenegro compares favorably with the Western
Balkans region, but still falls behind other countries in the wider Balkans region, such as
Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia. K e y remaining difficulties appear to be primarily located at
the municipal level, and with the hnctioning o f the judiciary. In particular, licensing and permit
requirements remain complex (180 days to build a warehouse), contract enforcement continues
to be difficult, despite improvements (49 procedures and 18 months), and procedures for
registering property are cumbersome (8 steps and 86 days).
34. Plans by the authorities to explore the scope for significant public-private partnerships,
particularly concessions to construct and operate major highway investments offer
opportunities, but also present serious governance risks. Limited infrastructure is a
constraint to development in Montenegro. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) provide significant
opportunities to encourage major investment, and to strengthen infrastructure throughout the
country. Pursued appropriately, PPP and concessions can bring real benefits, and are to be
encouraged. At the same time, however, PPPs need to be pursued within a competitive and
transparent framework in which individual investments are appropriately prioritized. Although
the Authorities are considering options to strengthen the current legislative framework for
concessions, any new Concessions L a w will need to be rigorously examined to ensure that it i s
consistent with such fimdamental principles. Independent, extensive and rigorous feasibility
studies will also be required to ensure that investments are viable, and that the Government does
not wind up holding significant contingent liabilities - or, at least, that such liabilities are
quantified in advance and reflected within the overall budget framework and priorities. This i s
especially critical given the very large size o f some the investments being considered:
preliminary estimates, for instance, suggest that the total investment required for an Adriatic

11

County Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

highway in Montenegro and a North-South highway connecting Belgrade, Podgorica and the
coast, could total as much as 150 percent o f Montenegro’s annual GDP.

35. Continued implementation of financial sector reforms, as suggested by the joint World
Bank-IMF financial sector assessment program (FSAP) will be important. The Central
Bank o f Montenegro has prepared an action plan focused o n strengthening supervision, similar to
the approach adopted in addressing internal control issues identified by the previous 2005
fiduciary assessment. The Central Bank acted responsibly in requesting a recapitalization o f one
institution following the FSAP. Among other measures to be adopted, an emergency liquidity
support arrangement will be developed. The Central Bank will also undertake intensive
surveillance o f those banks experiencing the most rapid credit growth, to ensure credit risk
mitigation practices are consistent with agreed limits. Tightening prudential ratios to fully reflect
macro-economic risks and offset the impact o f higher asset prices on credit ratios will be needed.
Guarantees o f appropriate Central Bank independence in the Constitution would also be an
important signal.
iii. Improving the Standard of Living of Citizens

36. Ensuring that growth i s inclusive, and that all citizens have the opportunity to benefit
from an expanding economy, i s recognized by the Government as a continuing challenge.
37. The EU accession process provides significant opportunities for rural and regional
communities in Montenegro, particularly in the poorer northern regions, but this will
require institutionalinvestments and regulatory adjustments. The EU accession process has
the potential to increase scope for niche agricultural exports to the EU market, as well as to
modernize the agricultural sector and promote regional and rural development through the very
sizeable funds that can potentially be made available as Montenegro moves through the
accession process. Should Montenegro become an EU candidate country, it will become eligible
for financing through the Instrument for Pre-Accession (PA) rural development and regional
development programs, which are to some extent comparable to the support provided for EU
members though the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Ensuring that Montenegro i s able to
make full use o f the opportunities available, however, will require significant capacity
improvements as well as efforts to harmonize legislation and agricultural incentive measures in
line with C A P requirements. In large part because o f the strict eligibility requirements, many o f
the new EU members states previously found i t very difficult to make full use o f the
opportunities available when they first became eligible as candidate countries. Montenegro n o w
has a window o f opportunity to put in place structures and institutions, prior to potentially
becoming a candidate.
38. Improving the quality and relevance o f education will help to ensure that people have
the skills to participate in growing industries. Poverty in Montenegro, as in many countries, i s
closely linked to education attainment: with households headed by people who did not receive a
secondary education three times more likely than average to be living in poverty. Montenegro is
on track to meet millennium development goals (MDGs) related to education, with a primary
school enrolment rate o f 96 percent, and with girls making up over 50 percent o f pre-school and
secondary students, and 48 percent o f all primary students. Secondary enrolment rates o f 85 to

12

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

90 percent are reasonable, but could be improved further - particularly among Roma
communities. Nevertheless, just over two thirds o f secondary students are in vocational or
technical programs that do not appear w e l l linked to labor market requirements. Compared to
Western Europe, educational expenses are not high in actual terms, but comprise a significant
proportion o f GDP (about 6 to 7 percent, compared to an OECD average o f just over 5 percent)6.
O f this, recurrent spending makes up a high proportion - about 75 percent - o f the total budget.
Despite efforts to improve school infrastructure, i t remains constrained and poorly used, with
many urban schools operating on multiple shifts, while smaller rural schools are underutilized.
Recognizing this situation, the Government has embarked o n a reform program to reinvigorate
the education sector, introduce new curricula, overhaul vocational and technical education,
improve teacher training and more closely link pay to performance, and to reorient expenditure
toward infrastructure and the provision o f textbooks and other materials. Although well
designed, strong efforts will be needed to implement this program.

39. Reforms to improve the health system and strengthen financial sustainability are
continuing. Health outcomes in Montenegro are comparable for other middle income countries,
and health sector MDGs will be met: almost all births, for instance, are attended by skilled health
professionals, maternal mortality is very low, and under-5 mortality o f 16 per 1,000 live births i s
l o w and declining. The Government i s focused on strengthening health sector financing. L i k e
education, health sector costs are not high compared to Western Europe in euro terms, but make
up a relatively high share o f GDP (almost 7 percent), not including additional out-of-pocket
payments that appear to be a common practice in the health sector. On the revenue side, the
health system is funded by high payroll contribution rates. On the expenditure side, very high
pharmaceutical costs (well above international prices) have historically been a feature, as i s
common in most o f the former Yugoslav states - due in part to limited international competition.
The Authorities and the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) have moved appropriately in recent years
to strengthen HIF’s financial situation and reduce arrears. The Government plans to allow
additional voluntary private health insurance options to be offered to the population. The
Authorities are also increasing the focus o n primary health care, including through pilot efforts in
Podgorica to give individuals greater scope to choose their doctor, with public financing
following patients’ choices.
40. Pension payments and social transfers to households are an important element in
minimizing the number of people in poverty in Montenegro. Estimates suggest that poverty
could increase by approximately a third without such transfers. The Government is anticipating
an increase in social transfers in 2007, in part to offset needed energy tariff increases. Spending
on pensions i s equivalent to about 10 percent o f GDP. In order to improve the long-term
sustainability o f the pension system, the Government has completed a parametric reform o f the
existing pay-as-you-go system. Also, the L a w o n Voluntary Pension System has recently been
enacted and the regulatory and supervisory framework i s currently being built to support the
successful operation o f the voluntary “third” pillar. In addition, the Government i s considering
the option o f introducing a mandatory “second” pillar retirement savings scheme. While the
Government should be complimented o n its readiness to analyze potential future reform options,
If GDP i s adjusted for the informal economy, however, education spending in Montenegro i s broadly comparable
to regional and OECD average.

13

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

international experience suggests that prior to the introduction o f the “second pillar” a rigorous
legal framework needs to be developed, administrative infrastructure put in place, supervisory
capacities built and appropriate investment opportunities existent for the second pillar finds. In
this light, Montenegro should consider introducing a second pillar only over time, and in
association with firther regulatory strengthening, deepening and broadening o f the financial
markets, and the introduction o f government t-bills with longer maturities.
IV. WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR MONTENEGRO
A. Past Bank Assistance and Quality and Management o f the Current Portfolio

41. Montenegro became a member of the World Bank Group on January 18, 2007,
immediately following membership in the IMF. Montenegro became the 185th member o f
IBRD, the 166th member o f IDA, the 179th member o f I F C and the 170th member o f MIGA.
Montenegro has not at this stage decided to j o i n ICSID. With the endorsement o f the Board,
Bank Group activities continued in Montenegro during the interim peeod between independence
and membership, although no new loans or grants were committed for Montenegro during this
period.
42. While Montenegro’s independence i s recent, the Bank has since 2002 identified discrete
operations and a separate program of analytical and advisory work for Montenegro, within
the framework of the overall Serbia and Montenegro program. In total, $42 million in IDA
credits will be provided for Montenegro over the period from FY05 to FY07, broadly in line with
the base case financing scenario set out in the last CAS7. This included a development policy
credit to support the Government’s overall reform program, as well as investments in key areas,
including the energy sector, solid waste management, and reform o f education, health and
pension services. O n the analytical side, a separate Montenegro Economic Memorandum and a
separate Montenegro Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PER) were conducted, along
with a separate Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and associated Report o n
Standards and Codes (ROSC), as well as more focused analytical pieces. Full details o f
activities supported through the previous CAS period can be found in the CAS completion report
at Annex 2.
43. World Bank Group support under the previous CAS was able to assist the Montenegrin
Government to undertake reforms under three broad, inter-related, medium-term goals:

(i) Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector. The Government
made good progress in the area, with total public expenditure falling from 47 percent
o f GDP in 2003 to 42 percent in 2006. The Bank’s SAC 2 adjustment operation
supported Government efforts to modernize the civil service, reduce health and
pension arrears, and strengthen the financial position o f the large state owned energy
company (EPCG). This was supported by specific energy, health and pensions
Despite income levels, Montenegro has been eligible for exceptional access to IDA on hardened terms. While
Montenegro became creditworthy for IBRD lending in FY07, the Government has requested that IBRD financing
opportunities identified in the last CAS be rolled over to FY08, in order not to exceed i t s strict borrowing l i m i t s
set out in the 2007 Budget.

14

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

investments current through most o f the CAS period, as well as a more recent credit
for education reform. Analytically, the PEIR was a useful tool to provide detailed
and specific advice to the Authorities o n additional measures to strengthen public
administration and reduce heavy recurrent costs.

(ii)Create a larger, more dynamic private sector. Good progress was also achieved,
with growth surging during the CAS period to 6.5 percent in 2006. The Bank Group
was especially engaged in supporting the restructuring o f the financial sector: SAC2
support for the privatization o f Podgoricka Banka, the last major bank in public
hands, was complemented by I F C restructuring investments into equity in Podgoricka
Banka prior to privatization, as well as new investments to encourage SME financing
by Opportunity Bank. A trade and transport facilitation program for both Serbia and
Montenegro had considerable success reducing customs processing times and costs.
Environmental investments, particularly in sold waste, were also designed to help
encourage tourism. Analytical and technical assistance by IDA, I F C and MIGA also
supported Montenegrin efforts to strengthen the Investment Promotion Agency,
expand export finance and insurance, and revise k e y legislation.

(iii)Reduce poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public
services. More limited progress has been made in reducing poverty, with the poverty
headcount between 2002 and 2004 remaining fairly constant between 10 and 12
percent o f the population. Nevertheless, recent strong growth and a significant
reduction in unemployment suggest that further gains may have been made over the
past year. Bank support through SAC 2, backed up by health and pensions
investments, as well as a more recent education credit, i s helping further
improvements in social service delivery.
44. Capacity constraints have hampered the implementation of the World Bank program,
but the portfolio i s now performing relatively strongly. Almost all investment operations
have run into difficulties soon after beginning, and the reform program supported by SAC 2,
while completed, was delayed. A joint portfolio performance review in June 2006 suggested that
three o f four investment operations were not performing at that time (although with the education
project performing strongly). The Government has undertaken significant efforts to improve
portfolio performance, supported by strengthened supervision from Bank teams. The portfolio i s
now performing well, with only one operation not satisfactory. Problems are still being
experienced with the Montenegro Environmentally Sustainable Tourism Project, which has been
designed to help address the significant problem o f solid waste in coastal municipalities.
Squabbling between municipalities about the location o f waste sites resulted in landfills not
receiving necessary permits. The lack o f properly managed landfills i s likely to increase the
practice o f “wild dumps”, and could potentially hurt Montenegro’s ability to attract higher end
tourism. The Government has requested additional time to restructure this operation, but unless
this i s done quickly, financing may unfortunately need to be canceled.

15

B. Lessons Learned from the CAS Completion Report

45. The CAS Completion Report (Annex 2) identified a number o f lessons that formed the basis
o f this CPS. These lessons include:
The areas o f focus in the CAS were appropriate and the mix o f interventions
supported the objectives well. Given the substantial progress Montenegro has made
and the contributions that the Bank program made to that progress, the interventions
appear to have appropriately reflected priorities. Activities all contributed to the
desired outcomes.
Bank support should increasingly focus on Montenegro’s integration with the EU,
and assist in building the capacity of state institutions for better utilization o f IPA
funds. With the initialing o f a SAA, the support to EU integration process must take on
a sharper focus. As lack o f capacity i s one o f the key constraints o f Montenegro, the
Bank and other donors must ensure that capacity building i s a key element o f the
forthcoming strategy.
Encouraging sustainable economic growth should be a key focus for future
support. Montenegro has successfully maintained macro-economic stability during the
past few years. Structural reforms and efforts to maintain and improve the environment
will be critical to ensure that growth i s able to continue. At the same time, future
assistance will also need to pay explicit attention to efforts to ensure that the benefits
from growth have a wide impact.
Engagement across the Bank Group, while strong, could be strengthened even
further. There i s scope for new I F C investments over the short to medium to exceed
new IDMIBRD investments - especially as the Bank moves to IBRD lending and in an
environment where the Government i s seeking to reduce overall public debt. There i s
considerable scope to ensure synergies in the. provision o f technical assistance,
particularly in the transport, tourism infrastructure, and electricity sectors.
The Bank’s knowledge and expertise must be integrated fully into future
assistance. The Bank’s comparative advantage in Montenegro i s offering bundled
lending and financial products. Bank expertise, along with financing, can be especially
u s e h l to assist Montenegro given capacity constraints. Support in critical sectors, such
as tourism planning, energy reform, improving the business environment, streamlining
and improving social service delivery, and appropriately managing major PPPs/
concessions will require advice as well as financing. Similarly, Bank advice will also
be crucial to support any IMF program, which i s likely to have a strong structural
element.
Donor coordination has to be intensified. Given the strong need to focus the
assistance for Montenegro, the Bank needs to put more emphasis on donor
coordination. Stronger coordination with the EU could especially help to integrate Bank
investments with the considerable E C fhding for technical assistance. Coordination

16

County Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-I 0

with other major financiers, including the IMF, EBRD, and EIB will also be crucial, as
will even stronger engagement with significant bilateral donors.

(vii) The next CPS needs to be realistic about implementation capacity. Lending
preparation could be assisted by undertaking appropriate analysis to ensure ownership
and gauge commitment before developing operations, and with greater attention to the
readiness for implementation o f the projects. At the same time, however, the Bank
should not look only at “easy” activities: shareholders and other donors are looking for
the Bank to engage o n more complex and sensitive issues, where the institution’s
ability to bundle knowledge and lending services provides a comparative advantage.
C. Montenegro’s Country Financing Parameters

46. Separate country financing parameters for Montenegro were established in M a y 2007
(see Annex 6)’. Country financing parameters (CFPs) had previously been established for Serbia
and Montenegro in March, 2005. A s with CFPs for other regional countries, the CFPs for
Montenegro provide for added flexibility in allow Bank financing o f up to 100 percent o f project
costs, although the actual level o f Bank financing will be determined o n a case by case basis and
the Bank will s t i l l in most cases encourage cost sharing as a demonstration o f country ownership.
The CFPs also allow for recurrent cost financing on a selective basis, and Bank financing o f
local and foreign costs in any proportion. The CFPs have greatly facilitated Bank operations,
and reduced the transaction costs o f implementing Bank-financed operations by reducing
complexity. The additional flexibility provided will support project implementation, and i s f i l l y
consistent with the approach o f the CPS in emphasizing Government ownership o f underlying
project objectives. The maximum flexibility allowed by the CFPs, however, will be applied
selectively, and with due regard to sustainability issues and fiduciary oversight.
V. THE WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY07 TO F Y l O
A. Key Features and Themes of the Partnership Strategy

47. A program o f support until F Y l O i s designed to ensure that the World Bank
programming cycle i s consistent with the political cycle in Montenegro. The program will
support the identified Government policy priorities for i t s term until 2010. A new CPS in early
FY11 will allow the Bank program to be refined to reflect the priorities o f any new Government
that may be formed following Parliamentary elections scheduled for late 2010.
48. The World Bank Group will support Montenegro in its efforts to join the European
Union. The proposed program reflects the priorities defined in the Stabilization and Association
Agreement initialed by Montenegro, while also reflecting the Bank’s comparative advantages in
providing assistance and the Government’s broader economic reform program. The road to
Europe not only involves Montenegro designing and adopting EU compatible standards and
regulations, but will also require building the capacity to implement them. The World Bank

’ Pursuant to the Bank’s policy on financing for investment projects (OP/BP 6.00 Bank Financing)
17

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Group program can play an important role in this process: EU accession requirements will be
integrated into all aspects o f the program,.and the Bank can also work with the Authorities and
the E C to assist Montenegro to put in place the structures and systems to take full advantage o f
the opportunities offered by EU instrument for pre-accession (PA) financing, once Montenegro
progresses to candidate status in future.

49. Within the framework of European integration, the World Bank Group program will
reflect the Government’s three identified key prioritiesg:

(i) enhancing sustainable economic growth, through increasing economic freedoms and
strengthening the role o f the private sector;

(ii)building institutions and the rule o f law; and
(iii)improving the standard o f living o f citizens, through efficient education, health and
social protection systems.
50. World Bank Group support will be coordinated, integrated, and increasingly focused
on key challenges. While investments and analytical work are structured around the three key
priorities outlined above, Bank Group programs will be mutually reinforcing and
complementary. Interventions from IDNIBRD, I F C and MIGA will also be coordinated closely
and are expected to have strong synergies - although it also needs to be recognized that I F C
financing and MIGA guarantees are to some degree driven by private sector demand. The
IDNIBRD program will also be focused closely o n key objectives and increasingly streamlined.
The base case program envisages one new investment per annum, as w e l l as the scaling up o f
some additional activities - compared to about two per annum in the previous CAS. The overall
portfolio i s expected to decline from six current activities to a steady state o f four. The program
will also be designed to reinforce and support the efforts o f other donors: not only will efforts to
move toward the EU be factored into all activities, where relevant, but the interventions are
aimed at supporting a potential IMF program, and working closely with donors such as the EC,
EIB, EBRD and UNDP, as well as bilaterals such as the German, US, Japanese, Canadian and
Finnish Governments.
i.

Priority 1: Enhancing Sustainable Economic Growth

51. Given the centrality of sustainable tourism to the Montenegro economy, the Bank will
provide assistance for tourism planning, critical infrastructure, and environmental
improvements. Considerable potential for tourism along the Montenegrin coast i s associated
with growing environmental pressures that will need to be carefully managed to ensure that
Montenegro’s environmental beauty i s preserved and to attract higher value added tourism.

52. A new sustainable tourism development investment will help to improve the environmental
management o f the Bojana-Buna delta in southern Montenegro. The Bojana-Buna delta i s
known for its beauty, with 13 kilometers o f almost unobstructed beach, and with the dunes and
hinterland a habitat for several endangered bird species. Bank support will assist the
Government to grant protected area status to the delta region, as w e l l as strengthen
9

Economic Policy of Montenegro for 2007: Government o f Montenegro, December 2006.

18

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

environmental management structures, including the capacity to reduce the threat o f uncontrolled
construction. Associated with strengthened environmental management o f the region the project
will finance investments to improve water supply from L a k e Skadar, initially to the municipality
o f Bar, and subsequently to Ulcinj and the tourist areas o f Velijka Plaza and Valdanos. Water
supply i s emerging as a particular constraint to tourist development along the coast. In addition,
associated waste water investments are anticipated. W h i l e there appears to be strong support
from relevant municipalities for the new sustainable tourism operation, previous Bank financing
for solid waste sites, including for a landfill to service Bar and Ulcinj, has encountered
difficulties due to squabbling between municipalities. This activity may s t i l l need to be
canceled. Despite the delays and difficulties with the solid waste project, however, additional
investments to strengthen environmental management and improve water supply appear to
remain warranted. Should issues regarding landfills be resolved in future, additional support for
solid waste investments throughout Montenegro could be included either as part o f the
environmental investments in a proposed rural and regional development investment focused on
helping Montenegro meet EU standards (discussed below), or as part o f a series o f GEF-grants
for to improve environmental managements. The new sustainable tourism operation was
planned for FY07 in the last CAS. I t i s anticipated that the Bank investment will be divided into
two components: the first, in FY07, will be o n IDA-only terms, while the second, scheduled for
FY08, will be financed from I B R D ' O . The operation has been divided into two components at the
request o f the Montenegrin Government, in order to ensure that the Government remains within
i t s own strict fiscal borrowing limits for 2007.

53. The proposed sustainable tourism investment has been prepared in close coordination with
other donor partners. Tourism and environmental planning support will be coordinated with the
extensive support provided in this area at the national level by the German Government and
UNDP. Bank investments on water supply will also be coordinated with EB, EBRD, which are
finding an extension o f the regional water supply system along the northern coast, and with the
German Government, which i s financing improvements municipal water supply and efforts to
improve conservation and reduce water system losses. The Bank i s also preparing associated
investments, for possible financing by the Global Environment Fund, to strengthen regional
management structures in both Montenegro and Albania for the management o f Lake Skadar and
the associated watershed.
54. The Bank will support selective investments to support the Government's energy sector
reform strategy, in line with the South East Europe Energy Community Treaty. The Bank
will provide analytical and advisory support, as well as financing, to assist restructuring o f the
energy sector in order to strengthen long-term energy supply in Montenegro and improve energy
efficiency. Through the emergency stabilization o f energy supply project which i s currently
concluding, the Bank has helped the energy company EPCG to improve billings and collection
and reduce technical and non-technical losses, which are already reasonable compared to
regional standards. A new energy investment in FY0711 will assist the development o f a strong
lo

The Energy Community for South East Europe operation was initially approved in FY06, but did not become
effective prior to Montenegro's independence. This project has consequently had to be canceled and re-approved

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

and sustainable energy sector that can provide households and businesses with a secure, reliable,
efficient and high quality energy supply. Bank investments will be coordinated closely with E C
support to assist Government efforts to unbundle EPCG, and encourage greater private
investment in the energy sector. IBRD investments will focus especially on strengthening the
transmission system, which i s likely to remain Government owned. Bank investments will be
undertaken at the same time as the Authorities move to introduce required increases in energy
tariffs for households, as well as the largest consumers, such as the aluminum complex KAP.
Bank support will assist the authorities in efforts to introduce appropriate social programs to offset the impact o f electricity price rises on low-income households. Bank engagement will also
be coordinated closely with the IMF, as increasing the sustainability o f energy sector financing
and pursuing reform i s likely to be a key structural element in any IMF program. Energy
efficiency will b e encouraged as prices increasingly reflect full supply and import costs, as well
as inevitable distribution losses. In addition, an additional energy efficiency component i s
envisaged to be added to the new project in FY09. This i s likely to focus particularly o n
improving energy efficiency in schools, and health centers, as well as loss reduction in EPCG
transmission and distribution networks. I F C i s also exploring possibilities to finance private
sector energy efficiency project, given expected high demand in this area.
55. Bank investments in the energy and tourism infrastructure sectors will enhance
opportunities for IFC and MIGA’s possible sequential involvement for supporting private
sector investment in the energy sector. By offering finance and guarantees, I F C and MIGA
will help to encourage a wider range o f high quality foreign investors to consider opportunities in
the energy sector in Montenegro. IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership for South East Europe
(PEPSE) could also make a valuable contribution assisting the government to structure and
execute successfbl PPPs in the energy sector, as well as by supporting a transaction adviser for
the privatization o f distribution assets.

56. The Bank will continue to provide analytical and advisory products to the Government
on opportunities to maintain a sustainable growth path by improving the flexibility of the
economy. A series o f policy notes will provide a flexible mechanism for the Bank to respond to
demands from the Authorities as well as emerging priorities. Policy notes will initially be
focused on supporting structural elements in the IMF program, particularly on increasing labor
market flexibility, which will be crucial to ensuring Montenegro can maintain competitiveness in
the longer-term. This will build on the analysis undertaken in the 2005 Montenegro Economic
Memorandum, which discussed reform priorities for growth. A fiu-ther Country Economic
Memorandum i s envisaged for FY09, which could focus o n the remaining structural reform
agenda in light o f the possibilities provided by potential EU accession. IFC’s advisory services,
with MIGA, also anticipate providing additional technical assistance to strengthen the
Montenegro Investment Promotion Agency’s capacity to encourage reform and attract further
FDI to Montenegro.
ii.

Priority 2: Building Institutions and the Rule of Law

57. The EU Stabilization and Association process provides a clear framework for overall
efforts to build institutions and strengthen the rule o f law. Particular challenges for
Montenegro identified by the E C at the time o f initialing the S A A include: (i)reinforcing

20

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-I 0

democratic institutions, including adopting a Constitution in line with European standards; (ii)
comprehensive reforms to harmonize policies and legislation; and (iii)strengthening limited
administrative capacity to implement legal and regulatory framework. In many o f these areas,
the E C will, naturally, take the lead among donors in supporting Government efforts. The Bank
will focus on assisting the Government to respond to specific governance challenges, including
improvements in the institutional framework for the business environment, as well as
strengthened management o f major PPPI concession issues, which bring opportunities but also
risks. In addition, efforts to build institutions and the r u l e o f law and move toward EU standards
will be integrated throughout all interventions.
58. Strengthening the institutional framework for the business environment. Doing
Business suggests that the business environment in Montenegro i s comparable to or slightly
better than most o f the rest o f the Western Balkans, but with constraints still more evident than in
recent EU member states. Particular difficulties persist in land registration, and associated
municipal, planning, construction licensing and permits. Proposed Bank investments will assist
in strengthening the capacity o f municipalities to access data from the cadastral agency in order
to streamline and improve land titling, business licensing and permits, and enforcement o f
zoning and other regulations. This will be especially important given the very strong focus o f
current FDI in the real estate sector. The Montenegro Cadastral Agency i s technically
competent, with a good geodetic and technical base. Bank investments will focus o n building
more efficient and effective land and real estate markets, including firther improvements in the
overall transparency and accountability o f land administration institutions, systems and
processes, and the strengthening o f continuing registration services, reducing significantly the
time required to register transactions. Bank investments will also help to ensure that information
available concerning illegal construction is more readily available by municipalities in order to
better control development and prepare new development plans. In conjunction, support could
be provided to streamline the municipal building permit and licensing regime, the cumbersome
nature o f which currently presents major rent seeking opportunities.

59. The design and implementation o f a cadastre/ business environment investment will depend
on a fill analysis o f the situation in Montenegro, including a realistic assessment o f Government
capacity and commitment. Support will be provided in close cooperation with the German
Government, which i s already assisting in strengthening planning and cadastral issues, and with
which the Bank i s also working closely elsewhere in the Western Balkans. Support will also b e
coordinated with the Japanese Government and UNDP, which are active in the sector. Project
preparation will be closely informed by a proposed FIAS mini-diagnostic assessment o f the
investment climate in Montenegro during 2007, which will assess the legal framework for doing
business; identify the main administrative and regulatory impediments to private investment; and
consider options for FIAS technical assistance for regulatory simplification and implementation
assistance - focusing on business licensing, particularly at the municipal level. IFC’s advisory
services will also focus on business environment and investment in the tourism sector to improve
the competitiveness and level o f investment in this and related sub-sectors, such as construction,
real estate, and S M E linkages. In addition, IFC has been successfilly implementing different
standards, alternative dispute resolution, municipal simplification, and S M E tourism related
activities. IFC will extend selected Balkan-wide programs, such as the alternative dispute
resolution work, to Montenegro.

21

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

60. Opportunities and risks from large public-private partnerships (PPPs) and concessions
to finance infrastructure. Infrastructure concessions and PPPs provide an opportunity to
overcome key infrastructure constraints in Montenegro including, but not only, in the transport
sector. The Government i s currently considering options to finance the Adriatic ,highway along
the coast, and a north-south highway connected to the trans-European corridor system. At the
same time, however, it will be critical to ensure that such PPPs do not result in the Government
accepting large and unquantified contingent liabilities. This i s especially important as
preliminary estimates suggest that the major highways could cost as much as Euro 3 billion more than Montenegro’s annual GDP.
61. The Bank i s working actively with key members o f the donor community, including the
EC, the IMF, and the U S and German Governments to provide analytical advice to the
Montenegrin Government in their efforts to revise the Concessions L a w in accordance with
international best practice. In addition, the Bank anticipates providing a grant, through the
Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), to assist the Government in their own
efforts to undertake full, independent and comprehensive feasibility studies for major transport
corridors in order to determine the viability o f these investments, and the associated contingent
risks.
62. Advisory support could be complemented by investment financing for transport
infrastructure. Options could include support for a state guarantee to encourage concessions on
key road corridors that are considered broadly viable, or investment support for road sections
(either highways or local roads) that the Government may determine are best financed through
public investments, or road rehabilitation. I F C and MIGA also have a range o f potential
instruments, from direct financing to advisory support to political risk insurance, which could
support private investment in transport and other infrastructure. Should the Authorities move
ahead with concessions for viable infrastructure investments, I F C would have an increasing role
and will look for opportunities to support PSP and PPPs in the infrastructure sectors. Potential
projects where IFC might have a role through i t s advisory services include PSP or PPP for the
Port o f Bar (major expansion i s need in the container terminal to become a port for trans-modal
shipping), power generation projects, as well as water supply and waste water treatment projects
in the city o f Podgorica and several coastal municipalities. Investments will, however, need to
be dependent on completion o f current efforts by the Authorities to strengthen the regulatory
framework for PPPs and to undertake a full analysis o f the feasibility and viability o f these
investments. Investments from BRD, as opposed to I F C or MIGA, will also require a
continuing improvement in Montenegro’s overall creditworthiness sufficient to ailow the
headroom for additional sovereign borrowing under a high case lending program.
63. Financial sector strengthening. The Bank will provide technical assistance throughout the
Western Balkans to support implementation o f Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
recommendations. Following a joint Bank-IMF FSAP in 2006, the Montenegrin Government
has started to undertake reforms to harmonize financial sector legislation with EU standards,
further divest its holdings in the financial sector, strengthen the regulatory regime for capital
markets, hrther strengthen prudential oversight to mitigate credit risks (in collaboration with the
Central Bank), and to establish a systematic framework for providing emergency liquidity
support in the event o f a crisis. I F C will continue to look for opportunities to expand the reach o f

22

County Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

i t s microfinance programs through local banks, specialized micro-finance institutions, regional

funds, and advisory services, as well as explore the possibilities to support energy efficiency
projects working with local financial intermediaries.
64. Strengthening budget prioritization, planning and fiduciary management. Grant
assistance from the Bank managed, donor financed PRSP Trust Fund, will be provided during
FY08 to strengthen overall budget management and planning systems in the Ministry o f Finance.
This will be coordinated closely with support from the U S Government, which continues to be
the leading donor in this area. Programmatic Public Expenditure and Institutional Review
(PEIR) work during the CPS period will also allow scope for analytical advice to increase the
priority accorded in the budget for European integration needs and capital, as opposed to
recurrent, expenditures. The Bank will undertake a full program o f programmatic fiduciary
diagnostic work during the CAS period to assist the Government in efforts to further strengthen
procurement and financial management systems.
iii.

Priority 3: Improving the Standard of Living of Citizens

65. The Bank will support Government efforts to allow a wider range of citizens to
participate in, and benefit from, the opportunities provided by economic growth. The EU
accession process provides particular opportunities to assist poorer rural and regional
communities. Bank assistance in helping to streamline and improve the delivery o f health and
education services, as well as increase the sustainability o f the pension system, will also be
continued, although in a more consolidated manner. Investments will be supported through
programmatic poverty monitoring, and associated technical assistance.
66. The EU accession process provides significant opportunities to support regional and
rural development, and to modernize the agricultural sector. While agriculture comprises
only 15 percent o f GDP, i t i s a major source o f livelihood, particularly for many poorer families
in northern Montenegro. The EU accession agenda has magnified the importance o f agriculture
in Montenegro’s overall policy agenda. Bank investment support, in close coordination with the
EC, has the potential to assist the Government to access significant regional and rural
development financing from the E C,once Montenegro becomes a candidate country. Experience
among most other new EU members and candidates i s that investments and reforms have not
been sufficient to allow countries to make full use o f EU financing opportunities, even once
eligible. Investments can also help to improve farmers’ access to European markets. Specific
interventions could focus on creating the infrastructure to access potential EU financing,
refocusing assistance from subsidies to EU-compliant on-farm investments to improve
competitiveness, and helping producers and agro-processors meet EU veterinary and phytosanitary standards. The Bank is working in close collaboration with the E C in similar
investments elsewhere in the Western Balkans region. Environmental investments in northern
Montenegro, including both IBRD investments and potential GEF financing to strengthen the
environmental management o f the Tara and Lim river basin could also help to encourage greater
inland tourism, as well as support Montenegro’s efforts to meet EU environmental standards.

67. Continued support to improve and streamline social service delivery will be offered,
although in a more consolidated manner. Current education, health and pension investments

23

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

will continue through most o f the CPS period. These appear to have had some early success:
over 70 percent o f patients surveyed in the pilot site o f Podgorica consider that health reforms to
improve choice in primary health care provider have been a success, and Bank support has
assisted the Government to put the pension system o n a more sustainable footing, with parameter
changes and the expected introduction o f a voluntary “third pillar” retirement savings scheme.
Given the Government’s budget position and the relatively large expenditures already on social
sectors, at least as a proportion o f GDP, one option for fbrther Bank support would be a multisector operation to provide hrther technical assistance and advice as the Government moves
through the reform program. Alternatively, an investment could focus o n a particular sector
where there may be significant opportunities for gains, such as greater regional cooperation in
the provision o f specialized higher education programs. Final decisions o n the nature and scope
o f hrther social sector investments will be made during the CPS mid-term review. Although the
Bank i s the leading donor in supporting social sector reform efforts in Montenegro, assistance
will continue to be coordinated closely with other donors, including inter alia the Canadian and
Finnish Governments in the education sector, and the Japanese Government, which i s financing
the modernization o f the Clinical Centre in Podgorica.
68. Investments will be supported and guided by programmatic poverty analysis. Bank
managed donor trust funds also provide a mechanism to provide grant financing to undertake a
comprehensive household budget survey in FY08, as well as to support Government capacity to
analyze and respond to emerging poverty data.
B. The Financing Framework: Scenarios, Creditworthiness and Terms

69. Montenegro’s financing needs are limited, although the Bank’s ability to bundle
knowledge and lending products provides an opportunity for the institution to add value.
This will, however, require that the Bank remains highly responsive to Montenegro Government
priorities - while also offering impartial and robust advice where necessary. Advisory services
will need to be o f high quality to meet the needs o f a small but increasingly sophisticated client.
70. The CPS suggests a base case financing program o f $19 million in IDA and $50 million
in IBRD over the four year period. IDA financing will be limited to FY07, and reflects
uncommitted IDA funds remaining from the total IDA allocation o f $42million for Montenegro
outlined in the FY05 to FY07 CAS for Serbia and Montenegro12. IBRD financing i s equivalent
to $15 million per annum for FY08 to FY10, plus $5 million that the previous CAS envisaged
would be provided in FY07, but which has been rolled over at the request o f the Montenegrin
Authorities in order to fit within their own borrowing limits.

71. Higher lending support could potentially be offered, although this will depend on the
continuation o f the Government’s reform program. An additional $20 million as the upper
lending limit i s currently proposed in a high case scenario. High case lending will, however,

need to be dependent on strong policy performance in critical areas. Improved creditworthiness
(discussed below) will be particularly critical if Montenegro is to have greater scope for

additional IBRD borrowing. Further strengthening o f the legal and regulatory framework for
PPPs and concessions, as well as full analysis o f the feasibility o f major transport investments,
will also be critical to justify a significant infrastructure investment. High case lending triggers
are set out in Table 4. A final determination on high case lending eligibility and volume will be
made as part o f the CPS progress report, consistent with the Bank’s current policies and overall
policy o f strengthening engagement with M I C clients.
72. I n the event that current reform efforts stall or slow, the base case program will need to
be considered carefully. Should external events affect growth or the Government’s ability to
maintain macro-economic stability, continued Bank financing i s likely to remain important to

endogenous factors, however, lending levels will be adjusted downwards, to $5 million per
annum. If reform commitment proves insufficient to justify financing for reform initiatives, new
interventions may be focused primarily on support for social service delivery. Other proposed
operations will proceed only if the overall reform program ensures creditworthiness, and should
policy performance give confidence that they will be able to be successful.
i.

Development Policy Lending

73. Given the Government’s strong fiscal position, development policy lending i s not
expected in the current CPS. Nevertheless, there would be scope to introduce development
policy loans, within the overall financing limits set out, in the event that exogenous factors led to
Montenegro requiring fast disbursing lending, and provided that the implementation o f the
overall reform agenda remained appropriate to justify such support. Prime responsibility for
assisting the Government in responding to any potential macro-economic shock will rest with the
IMF, although Bank assistance could, if required, supplement support from the Fund.
ii.

Creditworthiness and Lending Terms

74. Montenegro has received exceptional access to IDA lending, on hardened terms, since
Bank programs resumed to the former Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (subsequently
Serbia and Montenegro) in 2001. Exceptional access to IDA was granted, despite incomes
well above the usual threshold, as creditworthiness considerations did not at that stage provide
scope for BRD lending.
75. Strong recent growth and reform performance, together with Paris Club and
associated debt rescheduling, has significantly improved Montenegro’s creditworthiness
position - although risks remain. Montenegro’s long-term credit rating was upgraded in
March 2007 by Standard & Poors to BB+. Montenegro’s public debt, at about 40 percent o f
GDP, i s l o w and declining. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains regarding the debt o f public
enterprises, which could become liabilities for the Government. In addition, while the
Government i s committed to a sensible strategy to limit restitution claims while providing
compensation for expropriated property, fiscal risks persist. IMF estimates suggest that the
planned package could increase debt stocks by as much as 10 percent o f GDP, at an annual cost
o f perhaps 0.5 percent o f GDP. A failure to implement the planned package could potentially
increase costs very significantly - to as much as 50 percent o f GDP. Since debt restructuring by

26

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FYO7-10

Paris Club and bilateral creditors in 2003, and a further debt write-off by Paris Club creditors in
2006, Montenegro’s external public debt has fallen to about 27 percent o f GDP. IMF baseline
scenarios suggest that Montenegro’s total external debt and overall public debt to GDP ratios
will both continue to decline to below 30 percent o f GDP over the next five years to 2012.
Standard stress tests also suggest a continued, although slower, decline in public debt levels.
Stress tests doubling the shocks, and adding 20 percent to debt stocks to reflect the effects o f
possible contingent liabilities and restitution, suggest that debt dynamics in this case would be
highly sensitive to changes in growth rates or fiscal policies, but less sensitive to interest rate
shocks.
Details are provided in Annex 7 . While confirming Montenegro’s overall
creditworthiness, this analysis reinforces the need for continued fiscal restraint as well as further
structural reform to promote growth.

76. Despite Montenegro’s reasonable overall public debt position, liabilities to the World
Bank are very large. Associated with i t s membership o f the Bank Group, for instance,
Montenegro assumed responsibilities for IBRD loans totaling Euro 270 million that had been
provided to the former Socialist Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia prior to the outbreak o f regional
conflicts in the 1990s. In addition, Montenegro assumed liabilities for IDA commitments
totaling SDR 59 million (not all o f which has been fully disbursed). The tripartite agreement
signed by the Governments o f Montenegro and Serbia, as well as the Bank, regarding
Montenegro’s assumption o f this debt i s currently before the Montenegrin Parliament. Given the
importance o f absolute clarity o n Montenegro’s debt position in determining creditworthiness, no
new IBRD lending to Montenegro will be able to be committed until Parliament has ratified this
agreement and it becomes effective. On a per capita basis, the Bank’s exposure to Montenegro i s
among the highest in the world. World Bank liabilities are equivalent to just under 40 percent o f
Montenegro’s total public debt, and about h a l f o f Montenegro’s external public debt. The
Montenegrin Government is considering pre-paying a limited amount o f inherited IBRD debt in
FY08. The Government may also decide to make additional pre-payments depending on
revenues that may be achieved from continued privatization.
77. Anticipated reductions in external public debt are likely to be offset by further
increases in private external debt. Data o n private external debt i s weak, although estimates
by the Authorities and the IMF suggest that private external debt jumped from about 16 percent
o f GDP in 2005 to 22 percent in 2006. Some o f this, however, may reflect hidden FDI, with debt
later converted to equity. While public sector external debt continues to decline, the increase in
private sector liabilities has resulted in Montenegro’s overall external debt increasing fi-om just
over 40 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 49 percent o f GDP in 2006.
C. Partnerships and Participation

78. Preparation o f the CPS was undertaken following consultations with a wide range o f
stakeholders (Annex 3). The CPS has been prepared in consultation with the Authorities, and
reflects the policy priorities o f the Government. A workshop was held to discuss the proposed
strategy with a wide range o f civil society stakeholders in Podgorica in April 2007.
79. The EU accession process plays a central role in defining Montenegro’s development
agenda. The Bank enjoys a close relationship with the E C in Brussels, as well as with the
European Agency for Reconstruction, which currently manages E C assistance in Montenegro.
This CPS was prepared in conjunction with the EC’s Medium-Term Investment Plan for
Montenegro. Activities are closely designed to support the accession program. The Bank and
the E C initiated annual “country day” discussions on Montenegro, focusing on coordination o f
overall strategic directions. The inaugural discussion in April 2007 focused especially on
coordination in the key areas o f agriculture, rural and regional development, and energy.
80. Close coordination with the IMF will be especially critical. The proposed IMF
precautionary S B A is likely to have a significant structural element. In the absence o f World
Bank development policy lending, the proposed program provides an opportunity for the Bank to
engage with the IMF in supporting policy dialogue with the Authorities. The Bank will work

28

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-I 0

especially closely with the IMF o n labor market reform issues, as w e l l as energy and pension
issues.
81. Coordination and harmonization with other donor partners i s an integral element in
both designing and implementing the CPS. Key multilateral institutions and donors in
Montenegro include, inter alia, the EC, EIB, EBRD and UN, as w e l l as the German and U S
Governments. Advice o f other donors was actively sought, the CPS outline was shared with
donors in April 2007, and the strategy incorporates an analysis o f other donor activities in
designing the specific interventions for potential Bank support. The scope to leverage technical
and financial resources provided by other donor partners, often o n a concessional basis, i s
crucial. In line with principles under the Paris agenda o n aid effectiveness, the Government i s
taking an increasingly active role in aid coordination, organized through the Secretariat for EU
integration and the Ministry o f Finance. This will also be strengthened by the preparation o f a
new Economic Reform Agenda.

82. The measurement o f results i s an essential component to improving accountability.
Table 5 aggregates the major results and outcomes expected to be achieved by the Government,
with Bank support, during the CPS period. A more detailed results matrix setting out the
expected outcomes o f individual interventions i s included in Annex 1. The Bank will primarily
depend on Government systems and agencies for the compilation and verification o f results and
milestones. While statistical data in Montenegro is weak, this will be strengthened by support
through the Bank managed PRSP trust fund, as well as the Statistical Capacity Building trust

29

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

fund. Technical assistance to the Montenegro Statistical Agency, MONSTAT, i s also being
provided by EUROSTAT, which has assisted with the development o f a masterplan for the
improvement o f economic statistics, and the Swedish Government, which i s supporting the
development o f a business register. The IMF has also provided technical assistance. The
Government i s also introducing Household Budget Surveys, with the first undertaken in 2005,
and national accounts data i s improving. The Bank will undertake a strategic program o f
macro-economic monitoring, (ii)
advisory work to ensure good tracking o f results, including (i)
programmatic poverty assessments, (ii)
programmatic PEIRs, (iv) FSAP follow-up assistance,
and (vi) a programmatic program o f fiduciary assessments.
VII.

R I S K S AND MITIGATION MEASURES

83. Regional stability. Montenegro i s striving to foster greater integration with the EU and with
its neighbors in the Western Balkans region. Nevertheless, efforts to resolve Kosovo’s status,
while important for the longer-term stability o f the region, have generated a degree o f regional
uncertainty and the potential for instability. Montenegro i s to some extent more insulated from
such risks compared to several o f its neighbors. The political consensus in the country on
fostering peaceful cooperation with countries o f the region suggests that such risks are
manageable. Strong political commitment across the region to EU integration may also serve to
mitigate political risks, as will initiatives, such as CEFTA and the South East Europe Energy
Community, to encourage regional cooperation. The Bank will monitor regional developments
closely, and will make necessary adjustments to the CPS as warranted. Internal political risks
are limited, although the development o f a Constitution in line with European standards and a
continued smooth transition in the political leadership will be key.
84. R i s k s o f a “Hard-Landing”. While a soft-landing from the current economic boom seems
likely, this can not be guaranteed. There are clear signs o f exuberance in the property and stock
markets, and the risk o f a sudden change in sentiment. Montenegro’s economic prospects are
also narrowly based and heavily dependent o n tourism and metals, both o f which depend to a
significant degree o n strong global demand. Emerging limitations o n energy supply across
Europe and the Western Balkans also poses risks. The euroization o f the economy, while a key
plank in recent macro-stability means that any slowdown in the global economy or foreign
investment will directly flow through to growth in Montenegro. While the risks o f a sudden
economic slow-down are low, Montenegro’s ability to manage a soft landing from current high
levels o f economic activity will depend critically on continued structural reform - particularly
greater labor market flexibility, continued financial sector reform, and the maintenance o f a
strong fiscal position through the cyclical upswing. Maintenance o f fiscal discipline will
especially require an appropriate resolution o f potentially very significant restitution claims. The
Bank will help the authorities to encourage public understanding o f the need for such reform. In
the event o f a sudden slow-down, development policy lending could be provided within the
overall financing envelope, if required and provided reform efforts warrant.

85. Continued economic exuberance reducing reform commitment. The current economic
boom provides a window o f opportunity for renewed economic reform, particularly given the
resolution o f independence and the establishment o f a new Government. Yet while reform i s
required for Montenegro to maintain strong growth over the longer-term, experience elsewhere
suggests that continued exuberance may reduce the sense o f urgency for reform. The Bank can
30

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

play an important role, through analytical and other products, in working with key Government
counterparts to encourage public understanding o f the importance o f further reform. Linking
reform efforts to European integration, which has widespread popular support, also provides
scope to ensure public understanding for continued efforts. Nevertheless, at a time when the
Government has an increasingly wide range o f financing options available, the Bank will need to
ensure that analytical support i s o f very high quality and closely correlated with Government
needs.
86. Capacity constraints and portfolio performance. Capacity constraints, particularly given
Montenegro’s small size, have hampered portfolio implementation during the past CAS period.
Despite significant recent improvements in portfolio performance, this remains a continuing risk.
Greater efforts will be made to gauge commitment and determine readiness prior to new
investments. Centralized procurement and financial management arrangements currently in
place for health, education and pension investments will be maintained, although transferred to
the Ministry o f Finance in order to build capacity at the central level. Grant support, including
through the PRSP trust hnd, will be used to build capacity. Greater efforts to link Bank
investments with E C and other donor grant financing for technical assistance should also
improve scope to manage capacity risks.
VIII. CONCLUSION

87. Montenegro i s well poised to continue its strong economic performance, and make
further progress toward its goal o f full European integration. Montenegro i s currently
enjoying a boom, resulting from a decade o f reform, the strong global economy, and the political
certainty generated by independence and progress toward EU integration. Ensuring a soft
landing, however, will require continued macro-economic stability, improved environmental
planning and investments, hrther structural reform, and renewed efforts to strengthen
governance and institutions. A key challenge will also be to ensure that the benefits o f continued
economic prosperity accrue equitably across Montenegrin society. The Government recognizes
these challenges. Inevitably, however, implementation efforts will be the key to success. The
Bank will continue to be a strong partner with Montenegro as i t faces these challenges, and i s
committed to helping the Government to achieve the results described in this CPS. A mid-term
review o f the CPS will take stock o f progress toward achieving outcomes and results, and
propose appropriate adjustments to support the strategy for FY09 and FY10.

Annex 2: REPUBLIC OF MONTENEGRO CAS COMPLETION REPORT

Country:

Date o f CAS: November 19,2004

Republic o f Montenegro

Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: November 2004 - April 2007
CAS Completion Report completed by:

Robert Jauncey, Senior Country Officer
Denis Boskovski, Operations Officer

IX. Introduction
1. This CAS Completion Report evaluates the impact and effectiveness o f the World Bank’s Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Serbia and Montenegro discussed by the Board o f Directors in November
2004 (hereafter referred to as CASOS). Given Montenegro’s independence and subsequent membership
to the World Bank, the Bank will prepare a new CAS for Montenegro covering FY07-FY 10 in 2007.
2. This CAS Completion Report will therefore evaluate the results from the previous Serbia and
Montenegro CAS that correspond to Montenegro alone. This i s feasible since the majority o f the lending
program in CAS05 was designed separately for Montenegro and Serbia, with the exception o f two
operations (a regional trade and transport project (TTFSE) and an export finance project (SMECA)).

3. W h i l e the CAS05 was not prepared using a Results-Based methodology, this report attempts to
retrofit a results-based. The retrofitted CAS05 Results Matrix has been prepared as if it had been done
when the CAS was originally prepared in FY05.
X. Country Context
A. Political Developments
4. Montenegro proclaimed independence from the Union o f Serbia and Montenegro (SaM) on June 3,
2006 after independence. Following independence, Serbia was declared the successor state to SaM and
succeeded to the membership in the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and other international institutions.
Montenegro became a new member o f the World Bank and the IMF in January 2007.

5. A degree o f policy continuity i s expected. In the short period since independence, Montenegro
carried out parliamentary and municipal elections (elections were held in 14 out o f 21 municipalities). At
the national level, the governing and pro-independence coalition o f the Democratic Party o f Socialists
(DPS) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) led by then Prime Minister Djukanovic won a majority o f
41 seats in the 81-seats Parliament. The same coalition won in 11 out o f the 14 municipalities at the local
election. After the elections, Mr. Djukanovic stepped down as Prime Minister, and was replaced by
former Minister o f Justice Sturanovic. The new Government appointed in November 2006 streamlined
the structure o f government, reducing the number o f Deputy Prime Ministers to two (responsible for
Economic Development and European Integration respectively) and the number o f M i n i s t r i e s from 15 to
13. These changes gave some early indication o f the Government’s commitment to continue with public
institutional reforms.

39

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

6. Advancing European integration i s a key policy priority for the Government, as emphasized during
the referendum and the subsequent election campaign. Ultimate accession to the EU i s an overriding
policy goal, enjoying broad public support. In i t s declaration o f independence the Montenegrin
Parliament ' I . . .confirmed as i t s strategic priority an accelerated integration into the European Union, and
i s determined to continue to efficiently fulfill the conditions and requirements included in the
Stabilization and Association Process". Following strong progress in technical discussions, Montenegro
initialed a Stabilization and Association Arrangement (SAA) with European Commissioner Rehn in
March, 2007.

B. Economic Developments
7. For nearly a decade following the breakup o f the former Socialist Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia,
regional conflicts and international isolation crippled the economy and delayed the start o f the transition
to a market economy. Since 1997, however, Montenegro, with the support o f the international
community, has been engaged in a long series o f macroeconomic stabilization, and market-oriented
structural reforms.

8. The authorities began implementing a program o f macroeconomic stabilization in the late 1990s,
anchored in the adoption o f the Deutsche M a r k (and then the Euro) as sole legal tender. As a result,
inflation has been reduced from 25 percent at the end o f 2000 to about 2.1 percent in 2006.
9. Fiscal retrenchment, supported by an IMF program, helped transform sizeable fiscal deficits (about 8
percent o f GDP in 2000) to a surplus o f 3 percent o f GDP in 2006. The fiscal consolidation i s
approximately equally split between expenditure reducing and revenue increasing measures and partly
reflects the economic cycle. The introduction o f VAT in 2003 has supported a relatively high revenue-toGDP ratio while reductions in transfers and interest payments helped lower public expenditures. Going
forward, further cuts in the wage bill, transfers to households and public enterprises, and interest
payments are needed to reduce aggregate demand pressures. Such cuts will also create the fiscal room for
increased public investment, efforts to strengthen capacity in EU related areas, and to ensure that the
Government has the capacity to respond to increased financing demands (such as for restitution), as well
as to maintain prudent fiscal policies through the economic cycle.

10. In parallel with the currency and fiscal policy reforms, the Government has also implemented a range
o f structural reforms, including price and trade liberalization, privatization, public administration reform,
financial sector reform, pension reform, and labor market and business environment reforms, which have
supported modest economic growth and transition. These efforts were supported by the first Structural
Adjustment Credit (SACl). The S A C l was in line with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (for
Serbia and Montenegro) prepared in June 2001 and updated in August 2002 and February 2004. The
S A C l focused on reforms to enhance fiscal sustainability and help create conditions for private sector-led
growth through reforms o f public expenditure management, pensions, the energy sector, labor markets
and the business environment. The SAC2 sharpened the focus o f Bank support in the first three o f these
areas, while including support for reforms in the financial sector and the public administration. The
Government i s in the process o f updating i t s 2007-2010 Economic Reform Program, to guide the
implementation o f the remaining structural reforms. The new strategy i s expected to be completed by
mid 2007.

11. Partly as a result o f reforms, recent macroeconomic developments have been highly favorable.
Following sluggish growth rates in the early 2000's, the Montenegrin economy grew by an average o f
around 5 percent over 2004-2006 with growth accelerating to 6.5 percent in 2006. I t s principal human
welfare indicators such as poverty, l i f e expectancy, and adult literacy have remained moderate and stable,

40

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

with a recent reduction in unemployment from a stabile level o f 19 percent in the past f e w years to 14
percent in 2006.

12. The recorded current account deficit (before grants) remains one area o f concern, although this needs
to be viewed in the context o f very high foreign direct investment. Though declining from about 20
percent o f GDP in 2002 to slightly below 10 percent in 2005, the current account deficit appears to have
again widened significantly in 2006 to around 28 percent o f GDP.15 Montenegro’s merchandise exports
are not diversified and remain largely dominated by the export o f aluminum, which accounts for over 50
percent o f merchandise exports. Imports increased to around 66 percent o f GDP in 2006 driven by strong
FDI but also booming domestic consumption. Nevertheless, unlike most other countries in the region,
Montenegro’s current account deficit has been fully funded, and in large part driven by, FDI - which in
2006 was equivalent to 34 percent o f GDP. While it i s not unusual for small transition countries such as
Montenegro to run a high current account deficit to facilitate capital replacement, there i s a need for
Montenegro to adjust over time to a lower current account deficit, especially in view o f a continuing shift
to non-concessional loan financing from donors. With regard to debt, Montenegro’s total public debt
levels improved considerably over the last few years due to large debt relief and limited new debt
issuance. As a result, public debt levels have fallen to around 40 percent o f GDP, with foreign debt
accounting for about two-thirds o f the total. Standard & Poor’s recently upgraded Montenegro’s credit
rating to BB+.

13. Looking ahead, Montenegro faces the challenge o f maintaining growth within the framework o f
“euroization”. The likelihood o f a “soft landing” following very significant current inflows will depend in
large part on continuing structural reform. Inadequate structural flexibility in the economy, including in
labor market, business environment, and infrastructure may limit further growth and reductions in
unemployment and poverty. Further structural reforms focused on these areas will therefore be crucial to
speeding up growth and reducing unemployment, while further enhancing macroeconomic stability
through a tighter and sustainable fiscal policy. The Bank programs will continue to support these goals.
14. Risks persist. The country has benefited from strong global metals prices, particularly aluminum.
Montenegro’s heavy reliance on tourism (a highly competitive industry internationally) as a source o f
growth makes the country vulnerable to sudden shocks that could easily downgrade the medium-term
growth prospects and worsen fiscal sustainability. On the other hand, even if tourism continues to
develop, the strong difference in the development o f the north and south could pose further challenges to
the institutions to balance the development. In addition, there are signs that strong capital inflows are
negatively affecting the economy’s competitiveness; wage growth exceeds productivity gains and real
estate prices have increased dramatically. In the absence o f an exchange rate mechanism to adjust for
these imbalances, fbrther structural reforms are crucial in order to ensure that the economy has o f the
necessary flexibility to be able to respond to shocks and also create conditions for diversifyingthe sources
o f growth. Rapid credit expansion in recent years - although fully funded from domestic deposit growth as well as the need to improve security o f energy supply, pose risks that will require the continued
attention o f the authorities.
XI. Montenegrin Government Priorities
15. The policy program o f Montenegro’s Government i s built on two complementary strategies: the
European Union Stabilization and Association Process ( S A P ) and the Economic Reform Agenda 20022007, o f which the Government’s Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (DPRSP) has been

l5Montenegro’s

Balance o f Payments data are of poor quality.

41

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

part. With a shared ultimate objective o f EU integration, these two strategies encompass a comprehensive
reform agenda.
A. The Stabilization and Association Process

16. The S A P outlines three key challenges for Montenegro:
0

Reinforcing democratic institutions, including adopting a Constitution in line with European
standards;

0

Comprehensive reforms to harmonize policies and legislation;

0

Strengthening limited administrative capacity to implement legal and regulatory fi-amework.

17. Within this broad context, the S A P process envisages the maintenance of macroeconomic stability
and a number o f economic reforms, including Public sector reform (effective functioning o f the state
institutions; public administration reform and implementing the tax reform package, including VAT;
establishing an effective public procurement regime; and developing reliable statistics) and Private
sector development (speeding up restructuring, privatization andor liquidation, developing a f h c t i o n i n g
real estate market, promote employment; abolishing export duties and import levies and modernize
customs; and improving business registration).
B. Economic Reform Program and DPRSP

18. The Government o f Montenegro laid out i t s development priorities in the Economic Reform Agenda
for Montenegro 2002 - 2007 which aims to transform the Montenegrin economy. The paper recognizes
that a wide range o f reforms (legal, regulatory, simplification o f administrative procedures and incentives)
are needed to create an enabling environment for business. Specifically, the Agenda calls for measures
that would promote both foreign and domestic investments, such as reforms in the judiciary, a
consolidated and regulated financial sector, tax reform, diminution o f the grey economy and reduction o f
administrative bamers. Competition, competitiveness and job creation are also central themes in the
Agenda. I t calls for inter alia ending subsidies and reconstruction o f state owned companies,
simplification o f procedures for businesses to enter and exit the market, a complete review o f existing
business regulatory and securities legislation, and adoption o f a market-based, flexible labor law.
19. Within the overall Economic Reform Program, the DPRSP lays out a strategy for poverty reduction
aimed at improving living standards for the poor through reforms focused on establishing the conditions
for dynamic, equitable growth. In addition to eventual accession to the EU and World Trade Organization
(WTO) membership, the DPRSP has i t s core objectives: (i)public sector reform consistent with
macroeconomic stability and development o f a market economy; (ii)
development o f the private sector
through further privatization o f financial and productive assets and improvements in the business
environment; and (iii)poverty reduction (based on strong poverty diagnostics), improvements in the
effectiveness o f social programs, and attainment o f the Millennium Development Goals.
XII.

CAS05 Objectives

20. The CAS05 committed the World Bank to support Montenegrin Government reforms under three
broad, inter-related, medium-term goals:

42

Annex 2

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FYO7-10

.
.

Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector, through: fiscal consolidation, leaner
and more efficient public administration, better delivery o f state services and improved financial
sustainability o f pensions, healthcare and education.
Create a larger, more dynamic private sector, through: continued progress on restructuring and
privatization o f real and financial sector assets, restructuring and resolution o f large loss-making stateowned enterprises, improved access to finance, particularly for the SME sector, energy sector
restructuring and, where appropriate, private participation in infrastructure.
Reduce poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public services, through
improvements in support for rural communities, the coverage, targeting, and reliability o f transfers for
social protection and the quality, access, and financial sustainability o f health and education for all
citizens.

21. These objectives were supported by IDA credits that have utilized the Bank’s comparative advantage
and experience, backed up by analytical and advisory support.
22. During the period from FY05 to FY07, the majority o f IDA operations active in Montenegro were
approved prior to the CASOS. These pre-CAS05 projects include both the trade and transport facilitation
program (TTFSE) and export finance facilitation (SMECA) credit working in both Serbia and
Montenegro, as well as discrete activities for Montenegro, including the emergency electricity
stabilization credit, the environmentally sustainable tourism (MESTAP) credit, the pension system
administration improvement credit, and the health sector improvement credit. Details are in Table 1.

23. N e w Bank credits identifiedoutlined during the CAS05 process focused on supporting the continued
structural reform agenda (through SAC 2), as well as complementary investments in education
improvement, energy reform consistent with the Southeast Europe Energy Treaty, and sustainable tourism
infkastructure, particularly waste water and associated environmental investments and planning. A
planned follow-up DPL3 operation did not proceed given Montenegro’s significantly improved budget
and economic situation by 2007. IDA funds were consequently reoriented to investment operations. The
full base case CAS envelope o f $42 million i s scheduled to be delivered during the CAS period, although
with some delays - in part caused by Montenegro’s independence in June 2006 and subsequent
membership o f the Bank in January 2007. Montenegro did not access IBRD, as originally envisaged.
The Bank determined in 2007 that Montenegro i s creditworthy for IBRD, but the Montenegrin
Government’s own annual borrowing limits led the Authorities to request that IBRD financing component
o f the blended sustainable tourism operation be delayed until FY08. This i s set out in Table 2.

Montenegro Economic Memorandum conducted in 2005, and the subsequent Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PER) conducted in 2006, with programmatic updates. Core economic work was
supported by a financial sector assessment and ROSC. Analytical work on poverty i s continuing, and will

25. I F C investments in Montenegro have been focused primarily in the financial sector. Investments
include financing in FY05 - subsequently prepaid - for Opportunity Bank Montenegro to expand i t s
micro- and small-business enterprise loan portfolio. In addition, in FY05 non-performing loans were
restructured into an investment in Podgoricka Bank Montenegro (FY05). In FY06 Societe General
bought the Podgoricka Bank, including IFC’s equity, although IFC remains as a lender. IFC i s
considering new investments particularly in the tourism, tourism infrastructure, energy/energy efficiency,
transport, municipal finance and micro-finance sectors. IFC also has scope to support the possible
privatization o f unbundled components o f the energy company (EPCG) and possible major new
public/private partnerships in the transport sector. IFC assistance could include both technical assistance,
and particularly the possible provision o f a transaction adviser through the Private Enterprise Partnership
for Southeast Europe (PEPSE), as well as potential financing for investors. As Montenegro graduates to
IBRD financing and moves toward European integration, it i s expected that IFC will play an increasingly
important role in the overall support that the World Bank Group can provide to Montenegro. Given
synergies between IBRD engagement and IFC, stronger collaboration will be critical in the forthcoming
period.
26. MIGA has also been active in Montenegro providing technical assistance and analytical work. On
behalf o f the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), MIGA provided technical assistance to the
Government regarding the establishment and capacity building o f the Montenegrin Investment Promotion
Agency (MIPA), which was established in April 2005. To that end the MIGA team, under a short TA
program, helped to develop a professional investment promotion agency with the requisite skills, tools,
resources and strategic direction to raise the profile o f Montenegro as a competitive investment location
and to stimulate and sustain a sufficient flow o f foreign direct investment to act as an effective catalyst for
economic growth. Although it i s s t i l l too early to draw any firm conclusions on the outcomes and impact
o f the program, it appears to have helped fortify the institutional status o f MIPA and helped enhance the
institutional capacity o f MIPA to more responsively meet the needs o f foreign investors. As with IFC,
greater engagement between MIGA and IBRD i s envisaged in the forthcoming CAS. M I G M I A S will
be undertaking a mini-diagnostic o f the investment climate, and providing TA for regulatory
simplification and strengthening the implementation capacities o f municipalities. This will be closely
coordinated and will feed into preparation for an anticipated IBRD lending operation to support
strengthening o f land registration, and streamlining o f the municipal permit and licensing regime. The
availability o f MIGA’s guarantees also offers scope to encourage a wider range o f reputable investors to
consider purchasing assets that may be privatized, as well as potential PPP/ concessions in the transport
sector.

XIII.

Retrofitting the Results Framework

A. Goal 1: Create a smaller, more sustainable, more efficient public sector
Performance: Satisfactory
27. Montenegro made substantial progress in this area. Expenditures were reduced from 47 percent o f
GDP in 2003 to 42 percent o f GDP in 2006. At the same time, with government revenues increasing to
around 45 percent o f GDP in 2006 reflecting measures to broaden the tax base and improve compliance
and the cyclical upswing, the fiscal sustainability o f the Montenegrin Budget improved significantly and
moved to a general government surplus o f 3 percent. Total public debt levels also declined from 50% o f
GDP in 2003 to around 40 percent in 2006. At the same time, ongoing reforms in education, pensions
and health have started to improve efficiency o f service delivery.
28. The CASOS’S Goal 1 was supported by the Second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC 2), a multisectoral project that has contributed to each o f the three CAS05 goals. The SAC2 supported the
authorities’ reform program in the energy, pension and health sectors and in revamping the public
45

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

administration. By strengthening the viability o f the energy company (EPCG), the SAC2 contributed to
the decrease o f budgetary transfers needed to cover any losses or contingent liabilities. In the area o f
health and pensions, the reforms under the SAC2 supported the government's effective implementation o f
the pension reforms introduced in 2003 and help advance the agenda further by drafting a new law on
voluntary pension funds. The government's health strategy supported by the SAC2, helped ensure the
financial sustainability, efficiency and improved governance o f health insurance and health care by
helping the enactment o f a L a w on medicinal products, adoption o f implementation plan related to the
L a w on Medicinal Products, the L a w on State Administration, Public Procurement Law, Health Care
Law, and Health Insurance Law, and other related laws, covering changes required in the organization
and operation o f the Ministry o f Health, Montefarm, and the Medicines Agency o f the Government o f
Montenegro, satisfactory to the Association. It has also ensured that the 2005 budget law provided
adequate budgetary transfers to the health and pension systems, and adopted an indicative three year fiscal
framework. In the area o f public administration, the SAC2 supported the authorities in adopting laws on
the civil service that brought Montenegro closer to European standards by clearly defining the boundaries
between political appointees and civil servants and establishing the main conditions for the development
o f a professional c i v i l service. The Law on Salaries o f Civil Servants was intended to foster
decompression o f public wages, but macroeconomic concerns and differing policy priorities have limited
i t s impact. The base salary compression ratio increased from 4.1 to 5.1 in 2005, but 2006 increases were
flat rate for all positions. The wage bill as percentage o f GDP declined from 13.2 percent in 2003 to just
over 11 percent in 2006. Nevertheless, the overall wage bill remains relatively high, and has increases in
Euro terms between 2003 and 2006, although declining as a proportion o f GDP. Recent increases in
public sector wage rates, although offset in part by redundancies, reflect both the strength o f the trade
union movement, as well as overall wage increases as a result o f the very strong economy.
29. The ongoing Pensions System Administration Investment Project seeks to improve the financial
sustainability o f the pension system by increasing tax and contribution compliance; restructuring and
modernizing the key institutions o f the pension system; and strengthening capacity for evaluation and
analysis o f the pension system and pension reforms. While the entire legislative framework for the
existing pension system and consolidated collection have been enacted, project implementation has been
slower than expected due primarily to initial problems encountered in procurement o f large packages. As
a result, the targets for the end o f 2006 have not been reached. W h i l e there are slight improvements in the
collection o f pension contributions (2 percent higher in 2005 compared to 2004), reaching the targeted
improvements both in the level o f compliance and in the administrative efficiency will only be achieved
once the new collection system i s fully implemented. The activities supported by the project in these
areas have recently intensified and i t i s expected that the system will be completed by mid-2008. One
area where progress i s really significant i s the development o f a long-term pension model and capacities
for its use. The model has been finalized and i t i s now regularly used by the MHLSW's Pensions
department to identify viable reform options for future modifications o f the pension system. Also, the
L a w on voluntary pension system has been enacted and the activities on the preparation o f the required
regulations, development o f the supervisory capacities and public education are intensifying.
30. The main objectives o f the ongoing Health System Improvement Project are to improve the financial
sustainability o f the healthcare system by strengthening institutional capacity and information systems
and to improve quality, efficiency, and access to primary healthcare services. T h i s has been particularly
important as both public sector spending on health (at about 6.6 percent o f GDP) and total spending on
health (at about 8.6 percent o f GDP) in Montenegro i s relatively high compared both to countries with
similar income levels and compared to health outcomes. With regard to the health financing component,
a new payment methodology was prepared and has been piloted in Podgorica since June 2006, resulting
in the introduction o f the new payment system with electronic invoicing.

46

Annex 2

3 1. Analytical, Advisory and Other Activities. The analytical foundation for both Serbia and Montenegro
for the restructuring o f public finances envisaged under Goal 1, i s provided by the 2003 Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) and Montenegro PEIR Update, and the 2002 Country
Procurement Assessment Report and Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Over the CAS
period, the Bank’s knowledge base has been strengthened through the Montenegro Economic
Memorandum (MEM). The MEM (completed in FY05) focused on macroeconomic issues (particularly
public expenditure), labor market reform, and the business climate. A Debt Sustainability Analysis
update for Montenegro has been completed in CY2007. Additional support for improving the efficiency
and effectiveness o f the public sector in Montenegro has been provided through an Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant that has strengthened the institutional capacity o f the Central Bank as
relates to governance, internal control, internal audit, risk management and ethics.

B. Goal 2: Create a larger, more dynamicprivate sector
Performance: Satisfactory
32. The economy responded positively to the bold privatization and liberalization efforts and the
consolidation o f the fiscal balance. Gross private sector investments surged to around 36 percent o f GDP
by 2006, up from below 12 percent o f GDP in 2003, reflecting record FDI levels o f around 34 percent o f
GDP in 2006, growing competition in the financial sector and efforts to promote the country as a tourist
destination. As a result the growth rate o f the economy accelerated to around 6.5 percent in 2006.

33. The Bank and IFC have provided substantial ongoing support for the privatization and restructuring
o f real and financial assets in the country. In general, the privatization process in Montenegro i s well
advanced, including the sale o f very large companies such as Montenegro Telecom in 2005, the
privatization o f the aluminum plant (KAP) in 2005, the sale o f 67 percent o f the Steelworks in Niksic, as
well as a range o f smaller sales. In 2005 alone, privatization receipts topped Euro 200 million (equivalent
to almost 10 percent o f GDP), with associated commitments o f almost the same amount again in new
investments for privatized industries. Privatization i s probably 80 percent complete - although some
major assets, including the energy company (EPCG), Montenegro airlines and others remain in majority
government ownership.
34. The Bank, together with IFC, has supported the financial sector reform through SAC 2, particularly
the privatization o f Podgoricka Banka and the subsequent resolution by the Ministry o f Finance o f bad
loan assets from several poorly performing banks. IFC has also provided $5.2 million through
Opportunity Bank Montenegro to expand i t s micro- and small-business enterprise loan portfolio. The
financial sector i s now largely owned by the private sector, although the Government still retains some
small stakes.

,

35. SAC 2 also helped to promote growth through increased (and increasingly efficient) financial
intermediation and energy sector reforms that have supported both growth and fiscal consolidation by
overcoming episodes o f supply shortfall and ensuring the financial self-sufficiency o f energy utilities.
With support under both SAC2 and the Emergency Stabilization of Electricity Supply Project, collections,
as a percentage o f billing, have improved considerably over the past few years, from 80 percent in 1997 to
90 percent in 2005, and are expected to reach 94 percent or more in 2008. Payment discipline by the
largest industrial consumer (Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica - JSAP) has also improved significantly
after i t s privatization in 2005 and as part o f the Bank’s SAC 2, EPCG and KAP have executed a multiyear Power Purchase Agreement for the supply o f electricity that provides for a phased increase in the
price o f electricity. Despite an improvement in collections, losses in EPCG’s distribution networks
remain very high at around 30 percent, o f which two thirds i s estimated to be commercial losses and the
remaining one third i s technical losses. As part o f the Bank’s Emergency Stabilization of Electricity
Supply Project, EPCG has been implementing a pilot program for loss reduction that includes the
47

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

Annex 2

introduction o f automatic meter reading in pilot areas to examine impact o f application o f advance
metering technology on reducing commercial losses. The installation o f the pilot system i s expected to be
completed by the end o f M a y 2007, and the assessment o f i t s results will assist EPCG in developing an
action plan for rehabilitation o f the distribution network and consumer meters. The action plan will be
part o f a three phase strategy for loss reduction in the distribution network that EPCG i s developing in
order to reduce the unacceptably high level o f network losses.
36. Further support for the energy sector will also be provided through the Energy Community o f South
East Europe (ECSEE) adaptable programmatic loan (APL). This project, initially approved by the Bank
just prior to Montenegro’s independence but never made effective, will be reapproved in 2007 now that
Montenegro has formally become a member o f the Bank. The regional energy project will support
Montenegro in implementing i t s program for power market liberalization and regional power market
accession. More specifically, the project will support necessary investments to help ensure the security
and reliability o f the electricity supply to the population while the market i s being liberalized and
integrated to an even greater extent with the regional power market. I t i s expected that this will reduce
energy costs for industrial consumers, thereby boosting competitiveness, and compel national utilities to
be more efficient by subjecting them to competitive pressures. Nevertheless, likely increases in
residential tariffs will require compensating social assistance for poor households, as the Government i s
doing. Bank support i s consistent with an unbundling o f the distribution, transmission and generation
assets o f EPCG, and the anticipated privatization o f at least the distribution and possibly the generation
assets.
37. In the area o f trade and export promotion, the Bank has provided support through two credits,
covering both Serbia and Montenegro. The Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project
(TTFSE) i s one o f eight parallel country projects under the regional Trade and Transport Facilitation
Program, which aims to lower non-tariff costs o f trade and transport, reduce smuggling and corruption at
border crossings, strengthen regional partnerships and expand trade. Originally designed for the Union o f
Serbia and Montenegro, TTFSE continues to support modernization o f the Customs Administration o f
both countries, establishment o f modem information systems shared across border agencies (with the
ultimate objective o f establishing a single electronic window for tiaders), transparency o f information on
official requirements, and implementation o f new customs procedures at selected border crossings. In
June 2006, a Customs Survey, camed out in the context o f project supervision, indicated that significant
progress has taken place regarding the efficiency o f Customs between 2002 and 2006. All aspects o f the
project (transparency, equality, standardization o f procedures, ability to lodge a complaint) improved
markedly. According to the survey organized by Montenegro Customs Agency in June 2006, corruption
in Customs i s assessed as Low-medium (2.26 out o f a 1 to 5 scale) in Montenegro by respondents.

38. The Export Finance Facilitation Project supports the efforts o f the Serbia and Montenegro Export
Credit Agency (SMECA) to facilitate and expand cross border trade by offering political r i s k insurance,
working capital loans and guarantees, and export performance and credit insurance. The credit insurance
part o f the SMECA project insured export transactions o f Euro 190 million at the end o f 2006. The
factoring facility o f the project, used in conjunction with credit insurance, i s providing clients with
working capital for enterprises that do not have adequate fixed assets to qualify for bank loans. Turnover
in factoring increased from Euros 3.9 million in 2005 to Euros 10.8 million for 2006.
39. In solid waste management, the Montenegro Environmentally Sensitive Tourist Areas Project
(MESTAP) supports the development o f the tourism sector by developing ecologically and commercially
sustainable solid waste collection and disposal services in Montenegnn coastal municipalities. At this
moment, half way through the project life, a landfill in Lovanje with an operational and financially
sustainable Municipal Joint Company has been created and two wild dump sites have been closed in an
environmentally sustainable manner. At the landfill, the project i s also piloting a recycling plant for

48

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-I 0

Annex 2

paper, plastic and aluminum. In total, 90 percent o f the solid waste produced in three o f the largest
coastal municipalities i s being properly disposed at the above mentioned landfill. This project has,
however, proved problematic. Municipalities have been very reluctant to have landfills in their territory,
despite the counter factual situation o f increasing unregulated wild dumps and the associated pollution
and despite financial arrangements that ensure neighboring municipalities subsidize solid waste collection
and processing for the municipality in which the landfill site i s located. The Prime Minister i s now
personally involved in efforts to reach agreements among municipalities. Nevertheless, without a quick
turn around, this project may need to be cancelled.
40. With financial support from the EAR, MIGA has implemented an initial capacity building project in
support o f the new Montenegrin Investment Promotion Agency. MIGA’s TA activities are feeding into a
new, regional FDI outreach and marketing initiative for the Western Balkans which MIGA launched in
summer 2004 (the European Investor Outreach Program for the Western Balkans).
41. Analytical, Advisory and Other Activities. The analytical base for activities under Goal 2, has been
provided by the Montenegro Economic Memorandum (MEM), which synthesizes the findings o f
supporting studies o f energy, and business environment constraints along with some analysis o f the labor
market.
42. In the period covered by CASOS, IFC has provided support through i t s well-established Southeast
European Enterprise Development (SEED) facility, which was later transformed into Private Enterprise
Partnership o f Southeast Europe (PEPSE) and into I F C Advisory Services (TFC AS) after that.
Following the success o f its Leasing Project in Serbia, IFC/SEED implemented a Leasing Project in
Montenegro which paved the way for the introduction o f a Financial Leasing Law.
43. FIAS has supported the private sector by working on improving the enabling environment for
business. In particular, FIAS has assisted the government with a self-assessment o f administrative
procedures for doing business, with a study on the general investment climate. The study titled:
“Analysis o f the Investment Environment in Montenegro” identified several major areas o f concern.
These are: complex procedures for registration o f enterprises, along with the lack o f funds to stimulate
SME development, as well as shortcomings in the legal framework for competition and management o f
public and private enterprises
C. Goal 3: Reducing poverty levels, and improving social protection and access to public
services
Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

44. Despite significant increases in per capita GDP in Montenegro, overall reductions in poverty over the
last several years appear to have been more limited. Estimates suggest that between 10 and 12 percent o f
the population are under the national poverty line o f Euro 2.15 per day. Poverty i s most evident in the
northern regions, where almost 20 percent o f the population may fall under the national poverty line.
45. Montenegro has two distinct data sources in terms o f monitoring poverty: Living Standards
Measurement Surveys (LSMS) for 2002-2004 and Household Budget Surveys (HBS) starting in 2005.
The L S M S s were conducted over one month each year and use different methodologies from year to year.
This makes the poverty numbers difficult to compare (e.g. the 2002 data are not fully representative o f the
population, the 2003 data provide insufficient number o f records to estimate the statistical precision).
Still, even in these conditions poverty remained approximately stable. For the period 2002-2004, the
estimated poverty rates (headcounts) from various sources are: 9.4 in 2002, 12.2 in 2003, and 10.9 in
2004. Nevertheless, the significant drop in unemployment in 2006, from about 19 percent to about 14

49

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

Annex 2

percent, can be expected to flow through to reductions in poverty, which i s closely linked to
unemployment. This effect i s likely to be most noticeable in the rapidly growing coastal regions.

46. Bank support for Goal 3 included SAC 2, which improved the reliability o f transfers to the pension
and health funds and assisted the Government in developing a medium t e r m financing framework for both
pensions and healthcare services. In addition, Goal 3 i s supported by the Montenegro Health System
Improvement Project. The main objectives o f this project are to improve the financial sustainability o f
the healthcare system by strengthening institutional capacity and information systems for health policy,
planning, regulation and management in Ministry o f Health, Health Insurance Fund and Institute for
Strategic Studies and Prognosis. The project i s piloting the improvement in quality, efficiency and access
to primary health care services in Podgorica by investment in the training o f staff, facilities and
equipment, reform o f the organization and financing o f primary care. The “My doctor” campaign has
been piloted in Podgorica, resulting in 72 percent o f the citizens registering with their chosen doctor.
47. Support for Goal 3 i s also being provided through the ongoing Montenegro Education Development
Project which supports the reform o f the education system, strengthening the capacity o f the education
system, especially in the quality o f teaching and learning in schools, and in the efficient use o f budgetary
resources. Although the project i s s t i l l in the early stages o f implementation, there i s ample evidence for
i t s support to education reform notably by expanding the number o f schools included in the reform
program, rehabilitation o f schools, curriculum reform, enhancement o f school staff professional
development, introduction o f a state (Matura) exam, Pisa participation, and progress in eliminating arrears
o f the education sector to the state. In addition, current efforts aim at the enhancement o f the budgetary
process and the development o f the most appropriate approach to education financing at different levels
o f the education system.
48. Analytical, advisory and other World Bank Group activities. The primary analytical base for
activities under Goal 3 i s the DPRSP, the 2003 SaM P E R , and the 2003 Poverty Assessment. This
analyhcal base has been widened by the Montenegro PEIR update and a Poverty Assessment Update and
deepened through regular poverty monitoring, as well as monitoring of, and reporting on, DPRSP
implementation.
49. Activities under Goal 3 have also reflected the findings o f the MEM, the Study on youth in SEE, and
on social protection for poor and vulnerable groups, including Roma, Internally Displace People and
refugees. Activities under the Roma Decade o f Inclusion, including the development and implementation
o f the associated action plans, have also assisted in meeting Goal 3.

XIV.

Overall Bank performance

50. Bank performance overall was satisfactory. In contacts with Bank staff, government officials
consistently state that they value their relationship with the Bank highly.

5 1. Overall CAS outcome indicators were generally met. In line with CAS Goal 1, public expenditure
declined from 47 percent to 42 percent o f GDP as projected in the 2007 budget, while the overall service
delivery outcomes in the key sectors o f health, education and pensions appear to have been maintained or
improved and expenditure patterns put on a more sustainable footing. In line with CAS Goal 2, growth
and FDI have strengthened considerably, significant progress was made on privatization, and electricity
tariffs and collections have improved. In line with Goal 3, poverty measures show some slight
improvement, although most noticeably in the fast-growing coastal regions, and less so in the north o f the
country. Under the new primary care package and “My Doctor” reforms, waiting times have fallen and
there i s widespread public support for the reforms. Although direct causality can be hard to determine, in
all cases Bank interventions appear to have contributed to these gains.
50

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

52. Nevertheless, implementation o f the CAS05 program suffered delays. These were caused in part by
the referendum and subsequent elections and the limited focus on reform that almost inevitably occurs in
such an environment. In addition, the very limited capacity o f many Government institutions also
contributed to delays. This was confirmed by the Joint Portfolio Review (JPR), completed in March
2006, which clearly emphasizes a number o f implementation problems, reflected in very l o w
disbursements. Although this l o w disbursement percentage partially reflects the relative young average
age o f the portfolio (about 2 years) it i s also due to low implementation capacity for implementation o f
reforms, which resulted in difficulties and delays with investments - reflected in the 4 out o f 5 credits to
Montenegro being rated Unsatisfactory following the JPR.
53. Significant attention. to portfolio issues, and supervision in particular, has helped to turn around
performance. A renewed push on the reform front in both Pension and Health projects, and especially
electricity pricing and the installation o f meters has ensured that both the SAC2 and Emergency
Stabilization o f Electricity Supply loans have turned around -with SAC2 disbursed in late 2006 after full
compliance, and the electricity investment expected to do so in early 2007. At the time this CAS
Completion Report i s finalized, Montenegro portfolio has only one project rated U on Implementation
Progress.
54. After initial difficulties in the implementation o f the Pension System Administration Investment
Project (PSAIP), the activities have recently intensified under all components o f the project. The
progress i s particularly evident with respect to capacity building for pension policy development in the
MHLSW, where the long-term pension model has been developed and the staff trained in using it to
identify possible future reform options for the pension system, and the public education campaign for the
voluntary pension system. Also, two major software development undertakings in the Directorate for
Public Revenues and Pension and Disability Fund have recently started. These should be followed by the
procurement o f hardware and implementation o f the new pension administration system.
55. The Montenegro Health System Improvement Project (HSIP), approved in 2004, has experienced
severe difficulties and delays in the beginning o f i t s implementation due to divisions between main
stakeholders in the health sector. These divisions were due to political tensions and the ongoing
redistribution o f roles and responsibilities betiveen the regulatory bodies (MOH, IPH), the purchaser
(HIF) and the providers (PHC). After the Mid Term Review mission in 2007, the project has been
refocused and some subcomponents were restructured to reflect a more logical grouping o f the activities
financed by the Credit. Even though the project did not progress with the planned speed, results achieved
so far mirror the overall commitment to health sector reforms. This i s particularly true for the
introduction o f Family Medicine in Podgorica, where for instance 72 percent o f adults have already
chosen their family doctor, the main Health Care Institution (Dom Zdravlja) i s implementing a new
system o f medical appointments, and family doctors are providing a well-defined basic package o f
services with a much stronger prevention focus. Most importantly, these changes are already producing
results and an increasing number o f patients report satisfaction with the reform.
56. The Montenegro Education Reform Project has fully benefited from the strong commitment o f the
Government and the close attention o f the project team. Although relatively new (it was approved in
March 2005), the project i s managing to realize i t s full potential. The project i s performing well under
both the first component, where it continues to expand the l i s t o f schools that participate in the project and
support the introduction o f Matura exam and curriculum reform. There has also been progress on the
second component, which supports the Ministry o f Education and Science in costing education reform
and defining efficiency gains e.g. by developing a sustainable and efficient model for education financing.

51

County Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-IO

Annex 2

57. As a result, at the time o f preparing this CASCR, only the MESTAP project remains in serious
difficulty.
58. The Bank has made good use o f the Economic and Sector Work and AAA. The analytical work
complemented the adjustment and investment projects particularly in the areas o f energy, labor market,
fiscal policy and private sector. The Bank’s understanding o f poverty issues in Montenegro will be
improved by the ongoing Poverty Assessment Update, and the work i s well integrated into the program.
The portfolio has also benefited from thorough analytical work on public expenditure, which has been
mainstreamed into the sectoral interventions, such as education and public sector management.
59. Delivery o f products. As Table 2 shows, by the end o f FY07, the planned IDA lending program
will have been delivered in full. The Development Policy Credit 3 was dropped because o f improvements
in Montenegro’s overall public finance position. Nevertheless, IDA funds have been reoriented to
increase the IDA portion o f the sustainable tourism operation. Stringent borrowing ceilings led to the
Authorities deciding not to proceed with IBRD borrowing in FY07, although a second component o f the
sustainable tourism project has been rolled over to FY08 at the request o f the Authorities.
60. The work o f different parts o f the World Bank Group has been mutually complementary, though IDA
has dominated. The IFC has only a small program in Montenegro and has had difficulties finding
industrial investments o f sufficient scale. Overall, IFC i s likely to become an increasingly important actor
in Montenegro, given the continued privatization process as well as opportunities in the fast growing
tourism, tourism infrastructure, retail and financial sectors, as well as the scope for private financing o f
major transport sector investments. Over the next CAS period, new investments by IFC are likely to
exceed new investments by IDNIBRD. IFC and World Bank technical assistance will need to be
integrated well, particularly given the scope for synergies in the electricity and transport sectors, where
IFC might be able to provide a transaction adviser for the potential sale o f electricity generation o f
distribution assets, as well as for potential concessions for major road infrastructure.

61. Montenegro has received substantial donor support o f around 300 million Euros since 2001. In terms
o f donor coordination, there were substantial and competing priorities for development assistance in
Montenegro. Accordingly, the Bank’s country program relied on development partners to take the lead in
some sectors, in particular those in which the S A A agenda and the complementary EU program were
focused. The Bank has worked closely with EAR, as the main implementation vehicle o f the EC, in the
energy sector, and with USAID in public sector reform. As anticipated, this approach resulted in a more
concentrated program and emphasized reliance o n the Bank’s partners. Further linkage o f Bank support
to EU priorities and improving coordination with the EU will introduce synergies between the two
institutions, facilitate the country’s move to full IBRD conditions and increase government commitment
to reforms. The Bank has also coordinated closely with the German Government, EBRD and EIB in the
preparation o f the sustainable tourism development project.
A. Overall assessment of CASperformance
62. The team judges the CAS05 performance as Satisfactory in those areas where the Bank influenced
results directly. Montenegro made progress towards all o f the planned CAS05 outcomes and the Bank
played a significant role in helping the country achieve these results.

XV.

Lessons for subsequent CAS design

63. The areas o f focus in the CAS were appropriate and the mix o f interventions supported the
objectives well. Given the substantial progress Montenegro has made and the contributions that the Bank

52

Country Partnership Strategyfor Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

Annex 2

program made to that progress, the team concludes that the goals were selected appropriately. The
activities all contributed to the desired outcomes and no activities were redundant. Given resource and
capacity constraints both in IDA and in the Government, i t i s hard to see what additional activities the
Bank should have undertaken.
64. Bank support should increasingly focus on Montenegro’s integration with the EU, and assist in
building the capacity of state institutions for better utilization of I P A funds. With the initialing o f a
SAA, the support to the EU integration process must take on a sharper focus. As lack o f capacity i s one
o f the key constraints o f Montenegro, the Bank and other donors must ensure that capacity building i s a
key element in assistance during the next CAS period.
65. Encouraging sustainable economic growth must be a key focus o f the next CAS. Montenegro
has successfully maintained macro-economic stability during the past few years. Structural reforms and
efforts to maintain and improve the environment will be critical to ensure that growth i s able to continue,
given continuing poverty. The future CAS will need to pay explicit attention to ensuring that the benefits
from economic growth have wider impact among the different parts o f the population.
66. Engagement across the Bank Group, while strong, could be strengthened even further. There i s
scope for new I F C investments over the short- to medium-termto exceed new IDNIBRD investments especially as the Bank moves to IBRD lending and in an environment where the Government i s seeking
to reduce overall public debt. There i s considerable scope tb ensure synergies in the provision o f
technical assistance, particularly in the transport, tourism infrastructure, and electricity sectors.
67. The Bank’s knowledge and expertise must be integrated fully into future assistance. The
Bank’s comparative advantage in Montenegro i s offering bundled lending and financial products.
Montenegro has benefited from several important pieces o f ESW during CASOS. Bank expertise, along
with financing, can be especially useful to assist Montenegro given capacity constraints. Support in
critical sectors, such as tourism planning, energy reform, improving the business environment,
streamlining and improving social service delivery, and appropriately managing major PPPsl concessions
will require advice as well as financing. Similarly, Bank advice will also be crucial to support any IMF
program, which i s likely to have a strong structural element.

68. Donor coordination has to be intensified. Given the strong need to focus assistance for
Montenegro, the Bank there i s a scope to put more emphasis on donor coordination. Stronger
coordination with the EU could especially help to integrate Bank investments with the considerable E C
funding for technical assistance. Coordination with other major financiers, including the IMF, EBRD and
EIB will also be crucial, as will even stronger engagement with significant bilateral donors.
69. The next CAS should be more realistic about the implementation capacity o f state institutions.
The lack o f implementation capacity took i t s toll in CASOS, with many projects running into difficulties
soon after approval. Lending preparation could be assisted by undertaking appropriate W E S W prior
to ensure ownership and gauge commitment before developing operations, and with greater attention to
the readiness for implementation o f the projects.

Annex 3: CPS Consultations and Outreach
I.

CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH

Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CPS. Internally, the whole
country team has been actively involved in the preparation o f the strategy including I F C
and MIGA members o f the team. Early consultations begun in October 2006, when the

members o f the country team got together for two day retreat in Montenegro and, jointly
with the Minister o f Finance and other Government representatives, discussed the
development priorities o f the country and the general framework o f the Country
Partnership Strategy.
I n Montenegro, the Bank team has embarked on focused consultations with
stakeholders. The team started the consultation process by meeting and consulting a
range o f stakeholders, which included the non-governmental sector and academia. This
consultation process was finalized by an organization o f a workshop in Podgorica, the
capital o f Montenegro, which included the CPS Core Team and representatives o f civil
society2'. The results clearly show overall endorsement o f the priority areas o f the Bank
and i t s effectiveness in delivering the support.
The Minister of Finance led the government counterpart team to guide the preparation
of the strategv. The Bank and the government teams discussed the Bank operations in
Montenegro, including the lessons drawn from the Bank support so far. They reviewed
government's challenges and priorities as presented in the Economic Reform Agenda.

The government team discussed and prioritized the draft CPS program as presented by
the Bank. The l i s t o f programs and projects has been jointly finalized in the second h a l f
o f April. The government fully endorses the CPS program.
Specific consultations were organized for donors for the CPS priorities and donor
coordination. On April 23,2007, discussions were held in Brussels between members o f

the country team and representatives o f the European Commission. The purpose o f the
meeting was to present the draft goals and program o f the CPS and to involve the
Commission early o n into the design, thereby coordinating Bank's assistance with those
o f EU. Discussions with a range o f donors present in Montenegro were held o n April 24,
200722. This followed a range o f informal discussions with major donors over a period o f
several months. All donors appreciated the role o f the Bank in supporting the process o f
socioeconomic development in Montenegro. They agreed on the importance o f
selectivity, complementarity and information sharing to avoid duplication o f efforts and
wasting financial resources.
2'

Civil society stakeholders invited t o participate included the main NGO groups in Montenegro:
Expeditio, Greenhome, M A N S and M O S T ; the U n i o n o f Employers and the Montenegro Business
Alliance, as w e l l as the Centre for Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development (CEED) and the
Institute for Strategic Studies and Prognoses (ISSP).

22

Present at discussions were representatives f r o m the European Agency for Reconstruction, the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), and representatives f r o m the Dutch, German, Italian, Swiss and U n i t e d States Governments.

Annex 3

The Country OfJice will continue to expand its outreach and communication to
strengthen partnerships in the implementation of the new CPS. Communication tools
include, but are not limited to direct contacts with all stakeholders and information posted
on designated web sites. The Bank will also continue to support civil society activities

through the small grant program as well as through direct involvement in project
preparation and monitoring.
11.

PARTNERSHIPS

I n addition to building strong partnership with Montenegrin stakeholders, the Bank
has built effective partnerships with development partners and donor organizations
active in Montenegro. The European Commission (EC) and UNDP are the Bank’s key
multilateral partners in Montenegro, with shared responsibilities in donor coordination.

Given the clear EU perspective o f Montenegro, the Bank has started to coordinate most
o f its activities with the European Commission both in the country and in Brussels and
specific meetings for CPS preparations have been undertaken to ensure better alignment
o f the CPS with the Acquis. Relations with the IMF have been very effective and strong,
and the Bank is working closely with the IMF to encourage structural reforms which have
a macro-economic impact. The Bank also works closely with the Global Environment
Facility and will implement several GEF financed projects.

Annex 5: Montenegro Relations with the EU
I.

Main steps towards the EU

Following the referendum held on M a y 21, 2006 and the subsequent declaration o f
independence by the Montenegrin Parliament, the EU Council adopted on 12 June 2006
Conclusions stating that Yhe EU and i t s Member States decided to develop fkther their
relations with the Republic o f Montenegro as a sovereign, independent state".
The Government o f Montenegro has declared European integration to be one o f the
strategic priorities for the Republic. In i t s declaration o f independence the Montenegrin
Parliament "Confirmed as i t s strategic priority an accelerated integration into the
European Union, and i s determined to continue to efficiently fulfill the conditions and
requirements included in the Copenhagen criteria and the Stabilization and Association
Process".
The idea o f a S A P as a tool o f anchoring the countries from the Western Balkans towards
the EU was outlined at the Zagreb Summit in November 2000, after the Feira Council o f
June 2000 that addressed the future o f the Balkans countries i s in
In Zagreb,
the Western Balkan countries made a pledge to abide by the EU rules and conditionality,
receiving in return the prospect for EU accession based o n the Treaty o f the European
Union (TEU) and the Copenhagen criteria as well as on assistance program to promote
and support this ambiti~n.'~
The countries o f the Western Balkans also agreed that, when
signed, the Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs) would be the principal
means to begin preparing themselves for the demands that the prospect o f accession to
the EU entail^.'^
Following independence, the EU has started to adapt the instruments o f the Stabilization
and Association process to the new situation. Thus, an Enhanced Permanent Dialogue
meeting with Montenegro was held on 24 July 2006 in Podgorica. On the same day the
Council adopted a mandate for the negotiation o f Stabilization and Association
Agreement (SAA) with Montenegro based on the previous mandate for negotiations with
the former State Union. The Council also adopted a decision extending political dialogue
The European Council in Feira confirmed that i t s objective remained h l l e s t possible integration o f the countries in
the region into the political and economic mainstream o f Europe through the SAP, political dialogue, liberalization o f
trade and cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs. httP://www.euoparl.eu.int/summits/fei1 en.htm.
24 The European Council in Copenhagen 1993 spelled out the Copenhagen criteria, by which candidate countries would
be judged for accession on: (i)
stability o f institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule o f law, human rights and
respect for and protection o f minorities; (ii)
existence o f a functioning market economy, as well as capacity to cope
with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU; and (iii)
ability to take on obligations o f membership,
including adherence to the aims o f political, economic and monetary union - i.e. the acquis communautaire.
25 Engineered similarly to the Europe Agreements that were signed between the EU and the 10 countries o f Central and
Eastern Europe at the beginning o f 199Os, the S A A s focus on respect for democratic principles and integration o f the
countries o f the region into the EU single market. They foresee the establishment o f a free trade area with the EU and
set out rights and obligations in areas such as competition and state aid rules, intellectual property and establishment,
which will allow the economies o f the region to begin to integrate with the EU. The conclusion o f such Agreements
represents the signatories' commitment to complete over a transition period a formal association with the EU, tailored
to the circumstances o f each country but based on the implementation o f the same core obligations.

to Montenegro. The technical part o f talks with the EU was completed o n 1 December
2006.

On 15 March 2007, the Stabilization and Association Agreement between the EU and
Montenegro was initialed by the Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Sturanovic and EU
Commissioner O l l i Rehn in Podgorica. They agreed that initialing the Stabilization and
Association Agreement was a major step forward for Montenegro. The Commissioner
called upon Montenegro to prepare solidly for the implementation o f the Agreement and
strengthen i t s administrative capacity. The signing o f he S A A i s likely to take place in
October 2007. Following this, the S A A will be ratified by the Member States, which
could take up to 2 years.
The Agreement foresees the establishment o f a free trade area between the country and
the EU by the end o f a 5-year period as well as enhanced cooperation in the economic
field. The agreement also foresees enhanced cooperation in the field o f environmental
protection and in the area o f justice and security. Once the Stabilization and Association
Agreement has been initialed, it will have to be officially signed and transmitted to the
parliaments o f Montenegro and the EU member states for ratification. I t should also be
approved by the European Parliament. The main benefits o f the S A A for the citizens are:
Economic development through enhanced trade and economic cooperation and the
creation o f a business environment providing for investments, encouraging
individual entrepreneurial initiatives and generating employment.
Enhanced political stability and security due to good neighborly relations, regional
co-operation and deeper integration into the EU.
Progress in the process o f political and economic reforms, including in the areas o f
institution building, public administration reform, respect o f human rights and the
rule o f law, which are necessary to improve significantly the quality o f l i f e for all
citizens.
In addition to the S A A an interim Agreement, covering trade and economic aspects, will
enter into force on December 1,2007. The EU also has a European Partnership
document, which defines expectations and was published in January 2007. On the basis
o f this Partnership document, the government has drafted an Action Plan, currently under
review by the European Commission, which should be adopted very soon.

E U assistance

In total, combining CARDS, macro-financial and humanitarian assistance, EU assistance
to the former State-Union o f Serbia and Montenegro has amounted to more than €2.9
billion since 1991 to 2002, o f which more than €2 billion since October 2000. The focus
and main objectives o f EU assistance have evolved since the 1990s, covering conflict
management, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization and paving the way for a
closer association with the EU. The support provided through CARDS in 2005 (22

Annex 5

million EUR for Montenegro) focused mainly on the European Partnership priorities,
taking into account the political and economic situation in Montenegro and the
requirements that the Republic will have to meet in order to be able to conclude the S A A
negotiations and successfully implement the agreement. In 2006 assistance i s following
the same pattern for a total o f 19.5 million EUR. Montenegro also benefits from the
regional and multi-beneficiary actions o f the CARDS program.
Programming has also been launched for the preparation o f the future P A (PreAccession Instrument program) o f which Montenegro will be a beneficiary together with
all other countries in the Western Balkans. The multi-annual indicative planning
document (MIPD) and the European Partnership for Montenegro are in the process o f
being prepared. Montenegro should expect to beneficiate from around 97 million Euros
between 2007 and 2009 in pre-accession assistance under the multi-annual institutional
financial framework. This will provide transition assistance for 4 k e y areas: i)Political
(Copenhagen Criteria, good governance, civil society, minorities and vulnerable groups);
ii)Socio-Economic (to prepare the country to be ready for structural reform); iii)EU
Standards (Infrastructure, Energy, Transport, environment etc); iv) Cross-border
programs (small scale, integration). Next challenges would include setting up a
Decentralized Implementation System (DIS) that will be responsible for administering
future assistance from the EU.

II.

Key findings of the progress reports on Montenegro

O n 8 November 2006 the Commission issued for the first time a dedicated Annual
Progress Report on Montenegro as well as a new distinct European Partnership for
Montenegro. The key challenge identified by the report i s the upgrade Montenegro’s
administrative capacity, particularly in order to implement the SAA. These and other
priorities for Montenegro are set out in the draft European Partnership.

IK

Political criteria

The Report notes that Montenegro made some progress in the area o f the political
criteria. I t managed smoothly the process leading to independence. The parliamentary
elections held on 10 September 2006 were conducted in line with international
standards. Efforts to increase the efficiency o f the government, parliament and public
administration have continued. Some elements for a political consensus o n key choices
have started to emerge. Willingness to fight corruption and to consolidate the rule o f
law, including judicial reform, has increased. In practice, however, weaknesses
remained. The judicial system i s weak, while corruption and organized crime remain
problems. The country needs to significantly upgrade i t s institutions and its efforts, to
achieve results on the ground. The Constitution to be adopted needs to be fully in l i n e
with European standards. The Report emphasizes that cooperation with I C T Y must
continue.

62

Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Montenegro FY07-10

V.

Annex 5

Economic criteria

The Progress Report outlines that the country has made some progress towards
becoming a functioning market economy. Montenegro maintained a broad consensus
on the essentials o f economic policies, including prevailing macroeconomic stability,
while economic growth gained pace and foreign direct investment remained high. Still,
growth remains dependent o n few sectors, and external imbalances widened. The labor
market remained rigid and unemployment high, while the business environment i s
hampered by regulatory obstacles. Reform efforts must be pursued to enable the
country to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the
future.

VI.

European standards

Montenegro made progress in approximating legislation and policies with European
standards. I t further advanced in strengthening its administrative capacity in particular
in coordination o f European integration matters. Nevertheless, Montenegro i s s t i l l at an
early stage o f preparations and considerable resources need to be allocated to deal with
the challenges o f introduction and full implementation o f legislation. This concerns
notably key areas o f the SAA, such as free movement o f goods, customs, competition,
public procurement, agriculture and social policy, and employment. Special efforts are
required in the area o f Justice Freedom and Security, including the fight against
organized crime and visa policy.

Annex 7

Annex 7: Debt Sustainability Analysis
Montenegro’s Overall Debt Position

Following significant recent improvements, Montenegro’s debt position i s moderate, and
compares favorably to neighboring countries in the region.
Montenegro’s public debt has declined from almost 90 percent o f GDP in 2002 to just
under 40 percent o f GDP in 2006. Measurements o f public debt are imperfect, however,
both because o f imprecise measurements o f debt held by public enterprises, and
contingent liabilities, including restitution. Particular risks are’ associated with restitution
claims. The Government has decided to compensate citizens for confiscated foreign
savings in Banks outside Montenegro and to assume i t s share o f wage arrears from the
former State Union. Most seriously, as the process o f restitution was being finalized in
2006, the Authorities realized that claims granted by independent municipal committees,
which estimates suggest could be as much as 50 percent o f GDP, could threaten overall
fiscal sustainability. The Government i s currently discussing options to cap such claims
at a maximum o f 20 percent o f the assessed market value o f property, in line with other
countries in the region. This could limit total exposure to 10 percent o f GDP, with annual
fiscal costs equivalent to about 0.75 percent o f GDP.
Paris Club restructurings and debt write-offs in 2003 and 2006 have particularly helped to
reduce external public debt, which now makes up about two thirds o f Montenegro’s total
public debt. Without debt relief, it i s estimated that Montenegro’s total public debt would
have declined by closer to 10 percent since 2002, rather than the decline o f over 50
percent experienced. The vast majority - almost 85 percent - o f Montenegro’s external
public debt i s “old” debt, inherited from the former Socialist Federal Republic o f
Yugoslavia.
While public and public external debt is declining, a surge in private external debt
warrants cautious monitoring. The data o n private external debt i s particularly weak.
Estimates by IMF staff and the Authorities suggest that external private debt jumped
from 16 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 22 percent o f GDP in 2006. As a result,
Montenegro’s total external debt has increased fromjust over 40 percent o f GDP in 2003,
to 49 percent in 2006, despite continuing improvements in the public external debt
position. Commercial bank debt accounted for just under h a l f o f this increase, with
financial institutions taking advantage o f improved access to capital markets.
Commercial bank financing o f the credit expansion, however, has been less pronounced
in Montenegro as other transition economies. The remainder o f the increase may partly
reflect hidden FDI, with debt later converted to equity.
Montenegro’s external indebtedness indicators, both for solvency and liquidity, compare
favorably to other countries in the region.

Source: World Bank, Global Development Finance, 2005; Montenegro Debt Sustainability Analysis (2007)

World Bank Exposure

Despite Montenegro’s reasonable overall public debt position, liabilities to the World
Bank are very large - equivalent to just under 40 percent o f Montenegro’s total public
debt, and about h a l f o f Montenegro’s external public debt. Associated with i t s
membership o f the Bank Group, Montenegro will assume responsibilities for IBRD loans
totaling Euro 270 million that had been provided to the former Socialist Federal Republic
o f Yugoslavia prior to the outbreak o f regional conflicts in the 1990s. In addition,
Montenegro will assume liabilities for IDA commitments totaling SDR 59 million (not all
o f which has been fblly disbursed). On a per capita basis, the Bank’s exposure to
Montenegro i s among the highest in the world. The Montenegrin Government i s
considering pre-paying a limited amount o f inherited IBRD debt in FY08. The
Government may also decide to make additional pre-payments depending on revenues
that may be achieved f i o m continued privatization.
Debt Sustainability Projections

Debt sustainability projections prepared by IMF and World Bank staff are based on
strong real growth slowing gradually, with the current account situation improving as
FDI also slows. Scenarios also assume a resolution o f restitution claims consistent with
the proposal currently being considered by the Authorities. Privatization revenues, which
have helped the authorities to reduce relatively expensive domestic debt, are also
projected to fall over time, as the privatization process moves towards completion.

Under baseline scenarios, public debt and total external debt are both projected to
continue to decline to below 30 percent o f GDP by 2012. Using historical averages, total
external debt declines even faster, although public external debt, while declining, does so
at a slower pace.
Regarding public sector debt sustainability, standard IMF stress tests result in a slower
reduction o f debt in the medium term, but not a reversal, and the debt path i s robust to
most adverse scenarios. The IMF, however, recognizes that Montenegro is facing large
risks due to external concentration in trade and uncertainties in real debt levels, and the
Euroization limits the economy’s flexibility to respond to a shock. Additional stress tests
accommodating such eventualities (a one time depreciation o f 30%, a 20% o f GDP shock
66

Annex 7

to contingent liabilities, growthhnterest rate/primary balance shocks) indicate that debt
sustainability is particularly sensitive to growth and fiscal shocks. However, under such
tests the public debt ratio continues to decline over time (in the case o f the contingent
liability shock after a sharp initial increase).
Public debt sustainability analysis by the World Bank assumes a base case scenario that i s
more conservative than that o f the IMF (more moderate growth, weaker structural
reforms, lower private sector investment, C A D and FDI). The Bank’s assessment
concludes that Montenegro’s public debt would be sustainable if economic reforms and
fiscal performance continue at the current pace, but i s more cautious in i t s conclusions
that the IMF. Under a weak reform scenario, a favorable downward trajectory o f debt-toGDP ratio is reversed (the resurgence in debt ratio id due to slower growth, positive real
interest rate, higher restitution debt, and a higher primary deficit). Additionally, stress
tests suggest that Montenegro’s debt dynamics are particularly susceptible to a sudden
recognition o f high restitution debt and to a negative growth shock.
External debt i s also sustainable under a “soft landing” reform scenario. The stress tests
show that external public debt dynamics would be adversely affected, however, by a
negative export shock or smaller volumes o f non debt-creating flows in the short term,
although the impact wears o f f over the medium term. The Bank’s analysis observes that
Montenegro faces little external vulnerability from changes in the exchange rate and
interest rates since external public debt i s 87 percent Euro denominated (with no
significant currency mismatch), the bulk o f Montenegro’s debts are in fixed interest rates.
Overall, the Bank’s analysis concludes “. ..with the continuation o f current
macroeconomic policies, and an acceleration o f structural reforms aimed at enhancing
growth and reducing export vulnerabilities, Montenegro can absorb an increasing share o f
non-concessional official financing andor gradually access market based lending without
major risks to i t s public debt and external sustainability.”
