EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.
By historical and regional standards Senegal has achieved good economic results
over the past decade even though its performance was weaker in 2006. N o t only did GDP
growth average almost 5 percent per year, but poverty in households also declined by almost 15
percentage points between 1994 and 2002. Nevertheless, Senegal remains a poor country, with a
GDP per capita o f US$710 in 2005, and major deficiencies in i t s infrastructure and human
development. It also failed to report major improvements in man-made outcomes such as
governance, ease o f doing business, and technology development, which are crucial for a country
that cannot rely on significant natural resources.
2.

The Government i s well aware that it needs to do more and better to reach its
MDGs and reduce poverty by half by 2015. The implementation o f the new Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS), as well as o f the Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS), i s expected to
lead to higher economic growth rates, and to greater equity through improvements in the delivery
o f basic social services and in the protection o f the most vulnerable population groups. The
Government has also announced i t s intent to improve governance and strengthen participatory
processes and decentralization. This medium-tern vision has been approved by stakeholders in
Senegal and i s aligned with i t s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

3.
The proposed outcome-based Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the period
FYO7-10 seeks to support Senegal’s effort in achieving its ambitious development agenda.
I t i s the result o f a participatory process through which the World Bank Group (WBG) aims to
(i)
optimize i t s experience in Senegal; (ii)align i t s support with the Government’s PRSP
priorities and the Bank’s Africa Action Plan (AAP);and (iii)
find synergies with partners. The
new CAS recognizes that more efforts are needed to address the challenge o f weak governance
in Senegal, and introduces a “governance filter” comprising four core principles to ensure that
governance considerations are mainstreamed into all WBG’s programs: (i)
improve transparency
and efficiency in the use o f public resources; (ii)increase public sector accountability; (iii)
strengthen and modernize the judicial system; and (iv) enhance mechanisms for private sector
governance. This focus should help Senegal to close the gap with successful emerging countries.
4.

The CAS program i s selective by focusing on three pillars:

a.

Pillar I:accelerated growth/wealth creation. Strengthening GDP growth to an
annual rate o f 7 percent, which is 1-2 percent higher than the historical average, i s
perceived by Senegal as one o f i t s prerequisites for reaching MDGs. WBG support
will include a series o f IDA and IFC instruments organized to achieve the six
following outcomes: (i)
promoting a competitive investment climate; (ii)
building
and maintaining basic infrastructure for growth; (iii)
facilitating access to financial
resources by small and medium enterprises; (iv) promoting a modern and
diversified agricultural sector; (v) fostering sustainable development and
management o f natural resources; and (vi) developing skilled labor and use o f
technology.

vi

b.

Pillar 11: human developmenthharedgrowth. Increasing access to social services
and creating opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups, as growth performance i s
improved, i s at the heart o f Senegal’s PRS agenda. Improved equity i s crucial, not
only to ensure social and political stability, but also to achieve long-term economic
growth. WBG assistance will include a m i x o f financial and analytical support in
the education and health sectors, as well as in the area o f the protection o f
vulnerable groups.

c.

Pillar 111: rural and urban synergies. The rapid pace o f urbanization in Senegal
-six out o f ten people are projected to live in cities by 2015-raises
a key
challenge for the authorities who will need to find the right balance between urban
and rural development. To support the Government, the WBG will shape i t s
program around three major outcomes: (i)
balancing the provision o f infrastructure

between urban and rural areas; (ii)reducing the vulnerability o f immigrants and
emigrants; and (iii)improving the quality o f life o f the population through better
management o f natural resources and improved access to water and sanitation.

5.
As a tangible step toward achieving these medium-term outcomes, the proposed
CAS recognizes the regional dimension of Senegal’s development as well as the importance
of enhancing gender development and building local capacity. Several regional operations
and analytical studies are envisaged in the energy sector, the promotion o f the Senegal River
area, the road sector, with the development o f corridors with Mauritania and The Gambia, and
social sectors through regional initiatives in health and education. Success in the development o f
Senegal will not only depend greatly on i t s capacity to provide women social protection and
equal access to social services, but also to secure for them more and better jobs. Last, but not
least, the focus on capacity building i s justified because Senegal’s progress will be shaped by the
quality o f i t s labor force and entrepreneurs as well as the effectiveness o f i t s public
administration.
6.
A focused lending program i s proposed, in the range of US$420 million over the
four-year CAS period, which will complement ongoing operations and seek to optimize
WBG assistance given government priorities and partner programs. The proposed CAS
program will aim at balancing WBG lending across the above three key pillars and the
governance filter. I t will seek to maximize Bank assistance in Senegal through: (i)
the use o f
various financial instruments such as budget support, single investment projects, and community
driven development initiatives; (ii)leveraging financial resources beyond the country IDA
allocation through partnerships and donor coordination; and (iii)
enhancing regional economic
externalities.

7.
The CAS includes a core program of AAA which aims at supporting the
Government’s vision, and focuses on three main issues: (i)
labor market and productivity; (ii)
protection o f vulnerable groups (notably youth and street children and activities in rural areas
such as in the groundnut basin); and (iii)
fiscal policies, expenditure efficiency, and civil service
reforms. In collaboration with IFC and WBI, other analytical studies are expected to be carried
out on the development o f the knowledge economy, the regional housing finance market, and a
review o f the fiscal regime o f financial operations.

vii

8.
The program i s designed to mitigate risks that could limit the effectiveness of WBG
support. These risks can be grouped into three main categories: (i)
lack o f governance and
vested interests; (ii)vulnerability to political and economic external shocks; and (iii)
weak
capacity for implementing reforms. The measurement o f results is an essential component o f
improving mutual accountability and mitigating risks. The WBG will primarily depend o n three
complementary channels to monitor CAS progress over time. The first channel is the current
PRSP institutional framework for the compilation and verification o f results and milestones. The
second channel consists o f periodic portfolio reviews, in close coordination with the authorities
and other partners. The third channel i s to ensure that the strategic AAA program and
intermediary outcomes (or milestones) help track results over time, including a CAS progress
report in early FY09.

INTRODUCTION

1.1
The proposed CAS activities are clustered around three pillars and one cross-sector
governance filter. The three pillars are: (i)fostering economic growth through support to
private sector development; (ii)
improving human development through better delivery o f social
enhancing rural and urban synergies.
services, notably to the most vulnerable groups; and (iii)
Transparency will be mainstreamed in all programs and projects supported by the CAS to help
improve public and private governance. The CAS will employ a selected m i x o f Bank and IFC
financing instruments and a targeted program o f WBG Analytical and Advisory Activities
(AAA).
1.2
The proposed CAS i s (i)based on the WBG experience since the early 1990s;
(ii)
oriented toward results; and (iii)
aimed at supporting Senegal's second generation Poverty

Reduction Strategy (PRS) with the ultimate objective o f attaining the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). I t reflects the various phases o f the consultation process within the WBG and in
Senegal.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL

BACKGROUND

2.1
Senegal i s located on the West Coast of Africa and i s part o f the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a population estimated at about 10 million,
i t s economy i s dominated by a few strategic sectors, including groundnuts, fisheries, and
services. The role o f the agricultural sector has declined over time, from almost 15 percent o f
GDP in 1960 to 7 percent in 2004. The informal sector accounts for about 60 percent o f GDP.
I t s rural economy frequently suffers from drought, and lacks access to basic services and
infrastructure, leading to low productivity, high emigration and higher poverty rates in rural
areas. As a result, i t is estimated that almost half o f the population lives in cities.' This ratio i s
projected to increase up to 60 percent by 2015.
2.2
Over the past decades, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has
remained largely unaffected by regional instability. According to a recent World Bank study,
every year one out o f eight countries will suffer from an internal political conflict in Sub-Saharan
Africa.2 By contrast, Senegal has shown a remarkable political stability since independence,
which was strengthened by the successful transition to a new President in 2000 and the
Casamance peace agreement at the end o f 2004. This stability i s viewed as the result o f a
relatively free and diverse media (with numerous newspapers and radios) and an active civil
society (with hundreds o f NGO), as well as the ability to preserve the historical social
equilibrium between modem institutions and religious communities. Several indicators used by
the international community such as World Bank Institute (WBI) governance indicators (Table
2.1) and the Freedom House ranking o f civil liberties and political rights reflect the relatively
good health o f Senegalese institutions, and show that Senegal compares favorably to most

African countries. However, the quality o f i t s institutions s t i l l lags with respect to that prevailing
in emerging and OECD countries.
2.3
The last few months have seen an increase in political activities linked to the
preparation of the Presidential elections in February 2007 and the legislative elections
scheduled in June 2007. Events such as shifts in the Cabinet’s composition, and disputes
between the President and one o f the former Prime Ministers, have led to some government
spending irregularities, weaker budgetary controls by the judiciary and legislative powers, and
fragile governance in public and quasi-public enterprises (see more details in para 2.6).
Furthermore, the Government is now perceived as less efficient than a few years ago (the
Government Effectiveness WBI indicator declined from 61.2 in 1998 to 49.8 in 2005). Helping
Senegal reverse this trend will be at the center o f the WBG agenda.

RECENT
ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

2.4
Today, Senegal i s viewed as a good performer in Sub-Saharan Africa with its
economy growing at a steady rate of about 5 percent since the devaluation in 1994. The
Government has shown a capacity to generate economic growth, in spite o f exogenous shocks
(such as droughts and natural disasters). Inflation has remained well under control, at around 1-2
percent per year. The fiscal position has been strong, with an unprecedented l o w indebtedness
and growing tax revenues. Similarly, the current account deficit has been over-financed by
official and private capital inflows, resulting in substantial foreign exchange reserves equivalent
to over 3 months o f imports at end-2006. The monetary and exchange rate policies have been
kept in line with regional agreements.
2.5
Senegal has received significant capital inflows over the past decade. I t has continued
to be one o f the most assisted countries in the world (the level o f official aid per capita exceeded
US$lOO in 2004). Furthermore, the growing number o f Senegalese living in industrial countries
(and the increasing facilities to send money across international borders) has generated a steady
increase in remittances, estimated at around US$500 million in 2004,3 which have helped to

This figure does not include non-official transfers.

promote economic growth and social protection in SenegaL4 Overall, these two sources o f
foreign capital are now estimated to be equivalent to about 25 percent o f GDP.
2.6
The weaker economic performance in 2006, with a GDP growth rate projected
around 3.3 percent (but likely to be revised downward to 2 percent) and a significant
increase in the fiscal and external deficits, i s to a large extent explained by two main
factors. First, Senegal has been hit by the surge in international o i l prices and by financial
difficulties in the electricity sector as well as the largest exporting firm (Industries Chimiques du
Sinigal- ICs). Second, the latest political cycle has led to significant increases in public wages
and investments, under the pressure o f lobby groups and politicians. As a result, the fiscal deficit
i s estimated to have soared from 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to over 5.5 percent in 2006. The
electricity company (SENELEC) i s also under financial distress (with an estimated gap o f around
US$200 million at end 2006), forcing the authorities to increase prices and revise their strategy,
with the assistance o f the Bank and other donors. I t i s worth noting that the revenue performance
exceeded expectations, increasing by over 8 percent during 2006, and that the level o f public
debt declined substantially owing to the MDRI and the prudent management o f the domestic
public debt (see more details in Annex 5). The recent economic performance has been
associated with a widening o f the current account deficit from 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 7.6
percent o f GDP in 2005 and over 9 percent in 2006. This gradual deterioration was driven by
strong domestic demand, mainly from the public sector, and lackluster export performance. In
2006, the increase in the value o f o i l imports also contributed to a large portion o f the surge in
imports. However, substantial private capital inflows, combined with debt relief, allowed the
Central Bank to maintain its level o f net international reserves. The gross official reserves
reached about 3.8 months o f imports at the end o f 2006.
2.7
Given the favorable initial macro-economic conditions, l o w debt levels, the absence o f
Central Bank financing, and the beginning o f a new political cycle, Senegal should be able to
return to a positive economic trajectory in the medium-term, as long as the risks identified in the
next section are well managed by the Senegalese authorities.

MEDIUM-TERM
OUTLOOK AND SUSTAINABILITY

2.8
The medium-term scenario i s based on real GDP annual growth of about 5 percent
and continued low inflation during 2007-11 (see Annex 9). This growth rate i s at about the
same level as the average growth rate since the devaluation o f the CFAF in 1994, and consistent
with the l o w base scenario presented by the authorities in the second Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP-11). I t s attainment would require the continuous implementation o f sound
macroeconomic policies, market-oriented structural reforms, and an efficient Government
investment program. Private savings should increase moderately, facilitated by rising real per
capita income and financial sector development. Reflecting these trends, the external current
account deficit (including official transfers) would decline marginally from the projected 12
percent o f GDP in 2006, to around 7.5 percent o f GDP by 2010.
The medium-term outlook i s subject to a number of downside risks, but could also
2.9
be upgraded under specific conditions. On the one hand, Senegal’s economy remain‘s
vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including higher o i l prices, severe droughts, locust invasion,
and severe political strife in the WAEMU region. I t will also be highly dependent on the ability
o f the authorities to address the current crisis in the energy sector and chemical industry (which
s t i l l needs to be properly evaluated). The relative fragility o f the current account deficit also
emphasizes the need to promote private sector development, especially export-oriented activities,
which i s at the center o f the new Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS).’ On the other hand, the
rapid implementation o f the AGS may accelerate economic growth to the range o f 7-8 percent
assuming i t creates better conditions for the development o f private sector activities and thus
stimulates higher private investment and exports. N e w private activities could also arise from
opportunities in potential sectors such as tourism, Information and Communication Technology
(ICT), and agriculture.

2.10 The second positive feature of the medium-term outlook i s that Senegal has exited
the recent enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI with a good basis for maintaining
sustainable external debt levels over the medium term, especially if borrowing remains at
concessional terms and the level o f the fiscal deficit remains below 4 percent o f GDP (see Annex
5 for details). The recent Debt-Sustainability Analysis (DSA) conducted jointly by the IMF and
Bank staffs has shown that the level o f public external debt was as l o w as 13 percent o f GDP at
the end o f 2006. Public domestic debt i s estimated at about 3 percent o f GDP, o f which twothirds i s long term. The DSA highlights the need for Senegal to continue to adopt strict fiscal

POVERTYPROFILE AND UNEQUAL
PROGRESS TOWARD MDGS

2.1 1 Senegal remains a poor country, with a GNI per capita o f US$710 in 2005.6 The
latest household survey indicates that the proportion o f the population living in poverty
decreased from 67.9 percent in 1994 (61.4 percent o f households) to 57.1 percent in 2001
(48.5 percent o f households), which represents a significant achievement by both historical and
A clear indication o f the concentration o f Senegal’s exports i s that in 2002, the top five exports at the 8-digit
Harmonized System level represented over 40 percent o f total exports (petroleum, crude vegetable oil, phosphoric
acid, lobster and shrimps).

regional standard^.^ This positive evolution needs to be qualified on three accounts: (i)the
absolute number o f poor households has nonetheless increased; (ii)
poverty remains concentrated
in rural areas as shown by the fact that the decrease was larger in Dakar and other urban centers
than in rural areas; and (iii)
perceptions o f poverty show that two-thirds o f households identify
themselves as poor and one-third o f poor and non-poor alike feel poverty has substantially
increased in their community over the last five years.
2.12 The probability of being poor in Senegal i s highly correlated with access to basic
infrastructure services. The regions with the highest levels o f poverty (Ziguinchor, Kolda,
Kaoloack, and Diourbel) are those with the lowest access to water and sanitation and electricity.
For the rural population, and for the poor in both the urban and rural areas, access gaps are large
and reinforce their vulnerability.

*

2.13 Unequal human development i s both the cause and the result o f poverty. The
average life expectancy does not exceed 56 years in Senegal, as both infant and maternal
mortality rates are high (even in comparison to developing countries). The level o f education i s
improving, notably in primary education, but secondary and tertiary education suffer from
numerous problems, leading to l o w rates o f return and high dropout rates.
2.14 Poverty in Senegal i s also linked to the difficulty in finding jobs. Today, four out o f
ten potential workers are unemployed or underemployed in Senegal, and this proportion i s even
higher for young people who lack skills and experience. Part o f the problem i s rooted in the lack
o f dynamism o f the private sector and the declining share o f the agricultural sector in the
economy (most notably the groundnut sector). Indeed, since 2000, private investment has
declined in proportion o f GDP and the number o f new enterprises remains limited, at least in the
formal sector, due to various obstacles such as the difficult access to electricity at a reasonable
cost, the lack o f transparency in the business environment, and the poor hnctioning o f the
judiciary system (as reflected by Senegal’s poor ranking in Doing Business).
2.15 Another determinant of poverty i s the vulnerability of the rural population to
external shocks (such as climatic conditions), which affects their income negatively. Such
vulnerability has led to higher emigration rates toward cities, in particular Dakar, contributing in
turn to the deterioration o f living conditions in urban areas and to the emergence o f new
vulnerable groups (e.g., street children, see B o x 2.1). These trends have created increasing
concerns regarding food and water security, notably in booming urban areas, and sustainable
economic growth in all regions. This situation has fueled higher illegal emigration flows toward
industrial countries.

Box 2.1: Street Children in Senegal
Most observers agree that the number o f street children increased significantly over the past two
decades, but no data i s available. Preliminary estimates o f a 2006 census o f street children in the
metropolitan Dakar area put their number at over 10,000, an
st as many are likely to be
found in other urban centers throughout the country and parti
Kolda, Kaolak). These children are among the most vulner
enabling environment providing the psycho-social support they need. Living in abje
they are often malnourished, don’t go to school, are victims o f violence and have no access to
health care. Barefoot, in rags and tatters, they are now part o f the urban landscape.
The vast majority o f street children, mostly boys o f 3-14 years, come from rural areas, and over a
third come from other countries (Guinea Bissau especially). They include children entrusted to
Koranic teachers by their parents (talibb) who are forced to beg for a living, children whose
families live in the street, and children who have broken up with their families (e.g., runaways,
victims o f family violence, abandoned children). The talibks are by far the most numerous and
visible group, easily recognized by the tomato cans they carry to collect alms. A 2006 survey
suggests they actually spend very little time learning the Koran, and there are numerous cases o f
child trafficking disguised as Koranic schooling.
2.16 Progress toward MDGs has been unequal due to the mixed performance of Senegal
in addressing the main factors behind poverty and inequalities. As summarized in Table 2.3,
Senegal i s l i k e l y to reach i t s goals in terms o f universal primary education and i t s combat against
H I V / A I D S at the current pace o f progress. Senegal i s also w e l l o n track t o achieve i t s MDGs in
the urban water sub-sector, even though challenges remain in rural areas where about 3 m i l l i o n
people s t i l l need access to water and sanitation services. Furthermore, recent actions in terms o f
nutrition and immunization programs (Diphtheria Tetanus Whooping-cough 3 (DTC3) coverage
reached almost 80 percent in 2005) provide some encouraging signs o f progress. The number o f
people utilizing H I V / A I D S voluntary counseling and treatment also increased significantly, f r o m
9,900 in 2002 to 94,000 in 2006. However, major concerns remain with respect to the long-term
objectives o f eradicating extreme poverty, fighting malaria, and reducing infant and maternal
mortality by 2015. Senegal i s off- track o n these goals.

SENEGAL’S MAIN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

3.1
Senegal has yet to fully live up to its development potential. At the current economic
growth rate o f 5 percent, i t would take Senegal more than 12 years to reach a per capita income
o f US$l,OOO (the level recorded today by countries such as the Philippines or Paraguay) or
nearly 25 years to move ahead o f Tunisia and Brazil (assuming that these countries were to
remain at their present levels). Senegal’s development is hindered by serious deficiencies in
terms o f both human and infrastructure development. For example, electricity consumption per
capita remains significantly lower in Senegal than the average in Sub-Saharan Africa. The road
network i s underdeveloped and o f poor quality. Senegal was ranked at the 156‘h position by the
United Nation Overall Human Development Index in 2006.

7

3.2
The international experience has revealed that one pre-requisite for success in a
country such as Senegal, with limited natural resources, i s to perform better than others
transparency and
through a combination of man-made achievements in four main areas: (i)
Government efficacy; (iii)
ease in doing business; and (iv) capacity to adapt and
governance; (ii)
adopt new technologies through innovation and human de~elopment.~
Senegal has not yet
reported significant improvements in these four areas (see Table 3.1). Today i t i s ranked at
approximately the same level as Ghana and Vietnam but lower than successhl emerging
countries in the world (Ireland, Singapore, and Estonia) and in Africa (Mauritius, Tunisia).

3.3
The recent economic performance provides Senegal with the opportunity to break
with its history of relatively mixed results in terms of growth, equity and poverty
alleviation. Seizing this opportunity will require determined actions in two key areas:
(i)
improving public service delivery; and (ii)
promoting private sector participation.
A.

IMPROVING
PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY

3.4
Senegal enjoys a historical opportunity to increase the role of its fiscal policy owing
to the sound public management of the Central Government's financial equilibriums in
recent years, strengthened by the recent external debt relief." It would nonetheless be
incorrect to believe that an expansive fiscal policy will necessarily trigger accelerated growth in
Senegal. Experience over the past two decades shows that public spending and economic growth
are not necessarily correlated or, at least, not as much as private investment because o f persistent
weaknesses in terms o f allocative and operational efficiencies o f public spending.' If budgets

'

These four dimensions reflect the current literature o n economic growth. The emphasis nowadays i s given to the
role o f the quality o f institutions (as reflected by Government effectiveness and transparency). This approach
complements the more traditional view that has stressed the role o f technology, human capital, and private
investment (which are captured by technology and the business environment indicators).
IO
Such an increase should stay within reasonable limits in order to avoid exaggerated pressures on the current
account balance, which could deteriorate in the event o f an overly ambitious fiscal policy. For details, see Public
Expenditure Review, June 2005.
I' Allocative efficiency refers to the consonance o f budgetary allocations with the strategic priorities o f the country.
Operational efficiency, on the other hand, refers to the provision o f public services at a reasonable quality and cost.

8

are misallocated and/or misappropriated, the services that people need (and presumably desire)
may not get adequate levels o f finding. And, i f funds are misappropriated, both the quality and
quantity o f services that are offered will suffer.
Improving the allocative efficiency of public spending

3.5
The Government has increasingly recognized that the lack of allocative efficiency o f i t s
spending i s one o f the main constraints to achieving i t s poverty reduction objectives. A recently
completed Bank study on the effectiveness o f public investment, prepared in close collaboration
with the authorities, presents a selected set o f areas for reforms.12

3.6
The first area i s to consolidate public spending on infrastructure so as to close the
infrastructure gap. Senegal lags in terms o f the development and quality o f i t s road and
electricity networks, which are lower than the average in sub-Saharan Africa. The inadequate
supply o f infrastructure services has also contributed to the l o w productivity o f the private sector,
notably by raising transport and energy costs. World Bank estimates indicate that by
modernizing the road network and electricity grid to the levels achieved by Botswana, Senegal
could increase i t s annual growth rate by almost 3 percentage points.13
3.7
In response, the authorities have allocated an increasing share o f expenditure to
infrastructure, accounting for 40 percent o f total investment in 2004 and 2005 versus 25 percent
in 2000-03. Building new infrastructure has also become the centerpiece o f the President’s
vision, with the planned construction o f a new airport and an industrial platform located about 30
kilometers from Dakar, which will help to decentralize activities away from the Dakar area. The
adequate provision o f infrastructure in rural areas will also help promote agricultural activities
and reduce poverty, which is highly correlated with access to water and energy service^.'^
3.8
Fundamental issues remain to be addressed to meet the investment challenge in the
infrastructure sector. N o t only an increasing share o f public resources needs to be allocated to
providing and maintaining these services but it will also be necessary to attract private finds to
preserve the fiscal space. Such an orientation has already been initiated in the energy and road
sectors, but with mixed results over the past few years. The recent adoption o f the BOT Law and
the creation o f the Infrastructure Council have provided the basic elements for boosting private
sector participation in infrastructure projects in Senegal. Lastly, the authorities will have to
improve their capacity to plan recurrent costs over time as well as to assess the expected impact
o f large infrastructure projects on the environment and land management.
3.9
Second, the Government will have to upgrade the intra-sectoral allocation of
resources within the education and health sectors. The share o f education and health
expenditure in total public expenditures has increased significantly over the past few years, up by
0.9 and 0.5 percentage points o f GDP respectively between 2000 and 2004. This effort has

Impact Analysis”, 2006.

begun to produce positive results as illustrated by the recent increases in primary gross
enrollment (up from 67 percent in 2002 to 77 percent in 2004) and in immunization coverage
(DTC3 rate up from 54 percent in 2002 to over 80 percent in 2005). Yet, this effort must be
enhanced to help these sectors meet their MDGs. In the health sector, the Plan National de
De‘veloppement Sunitaire, revised in late 2004, provides the roadmap for the next few years. The
Government will continue to improve access and utilization o f basic health services through the
strengthening o f outreach activities, the implementation o f i t s infrastructure development plan,
and the implementation o f the regulatory and legal frameworks for private health service
provision and funding. The Government will also need to reinforce priority actions in the areas
o f preventing infectious diseases and utilizing reproductive health services.
3.10 In the education sector, there have been important gains in achieving higher enrollment
rates and gender parity in primary schools, including a higher registration rate for girls than for
boys as first graders in 2005, with 91.5 percent admission into grade one (girls represented 51
percent o f those admitted). The ratio o f girls to boys has consistently improved, reaching 97.2
percent and 86.6 percent in primary and secondary education respectively in 2005. To
consolidate this progress in terms o f access to education, the Government must improve the
quality o f primary education. There is also a need to improve quality and performance o f
secondary education as well as to reduce inefficient expenditure policies (e.g., generalized
scholarships to all university students). The authorities have started to give more attention to
vocational training by developing new partnerships with the private sector.
3.11 The third area i s to increase and harmonize budgetary support to vulnerable
groups. In a country where about half o f the population live in poverty and are de facto
excluded from formal social protection systems, social inclusion i s at the center o f the
development agenda. However, vulnerable groups have only received marginal attention from
the Government, as recognized by the authorities in their last two PRSP Progress Reports. The
recent review realized by the Bank has revealed that the existing lack o f coordination across
programs reduces their effectiveness, most notably in rural areas.” As a result, the Government
has developed a new Social Protection Strategy that was adopted at the end o f 2005. I t stresses
three main objectives: (i)strengthening and extending existing social security systems; (ii)
improving the prevention and management o f major risks and catastrophes; and (iii)
increasing
social protection o f the most vulnerable groups. The document also calls for better targeting o f
vulnerable groups and understanding the factors behind their vulnerability and exclusion. At this
stage, the Government seeks to mobilize further internal and external funding so as to make
significant progress toward protecting the most vulnerable groups in the country.
3.12 The last area emphasizes the need to improve the allocative efficiency o f public
spending not only across sectors but also across regions. Inequalities in the delivery o f social
goods and infrastructure are rooted in the unequal allocation o f human and financial resources by
regions. For example, a large proportion o f teachers and health workers are located in the Dakar
areas, at the expense o f remote areas where needs are pressing. The Senegalese Government has
initiated the decentralization o f decision-making regarding the management o f human and
financial resources, including the strengthening o f local Governments’ capacities and the gradual
transfer o f a number o f responsibilities to local communities, especially in the education and

health sectors. Decentralized execution o f the investment budget was initiated in the 2006
Budget L a w for the health and education sectors. Nevertheless, Senegal remains a very
centralized country with limited tax revenues for local Governments and financial transfers
(FECL and FDD) equivalent to less than 1.5 percent o f the central Government budget in 2005.
Clearly, the decentralization process needs to be accelerated over the next few years.
Upgrading the operational efficiency of public spending

3.13 The lack o f operational efficiency o f public spending appears rooted in cumbersome
and complex administrative and financial procedures. As a result, in June 2003, the
Senegalese authorities approved two action plans supporting public expenditure management
reforms (following recommendations o f the Country Financial Accountability Assessmentand initiated their
C F A A and the Country Procurement Assessment Review-CPAR)
implementation with the support o f donors, including the Bank and the IMF. Senegal has made
significant progress in the areas o f budget preparation and execution, notably in the priority
sectors defined in the PRSP. However, significant upgrading i s s t i l l needed in the areas o f
internal and external controls and o f budget execution in agencies and state-owned enterprises.
Similarly, efforts must be made to increase transparency in procurement o f public contracts by
upgrading the legal and institutional framework. Those weaknesses were most apparent in mid2004, when a series o f irregularities in infrastructure spending in a secondary city came to light,
and seem to have been exacerbated by mismanagement and lack o f transparency in parastatals in
recent months, leading to the accumulation o f debt. Such improvements will have to include
local Governments (in view o f the expected increasing decentralization) and public enterprises.
3.14 As part of their objective to improve the quality o f public human resource
management, the authorities have initiated civil service reform. They have recruited almost
15,000 new civil servants (as agreed upon with the IMF and the Bank), with an emphasis on the
main sectors o f the PRSP, including education, health, justice, tax collection, and security.
Concurrently, the Government has initiated the implementation o f a series o f reforms in i t s
remuneration policy aiming at (i)
improving the competitiveness o f public wages with respect to
the private sector; (ii)simplifying procedures; and (iii)introducing performance-based
incentives. The recent audit o f the wage bill has revealed that the implementation o f a new
payment system i s required to modernize the management o f human resources in public
administration. The Government will have to continue to experiment with new pilot projects,
such as the one recently tested in 25 health facilities, to introduce performance-based incentives
in key sectors such as health and education. The Government will need to strengthen i t s civil
service by giving more attention to the development o f adequate training programs, including
training in partnership with the private sector. An effective fiscal policy requires an increase in
labor productivity o f the public sector over time,

11

Box 3.1 : Main Achievements in Public Financial Management and Remaining Issues
The Bank’s fiduciary risk assessment rated public financial management as “moderate” in Senegal, in line
with the result from the Government’s comprehensive evaluation o f the C F A A and CPAR action plans
carried out in June 2006. Overall, progress was judged encouraging, with 70 percent and 44 percent o f
the C F A A and CPAR actions respectively completed by end 2005. Major achievements were realized in
terms o f preparation and execution o f the budget, notably through the use o f programmatic budgets in key
ministries and the gradual decentralization o f budget execution from the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance to line ministries. The implementation o f the s o h a r e system SIGFIP was also perceived as a
major step forward. On procurement, the first ever audit was published at end 2005 and key Ministries
have started to develop annual plans to help streamline procedures and avoid concentration o f contracts in
the last quarter o f the calendar year. With regard to controls, it was noted that the Treasury had been able
to transfer all state accounts accumulated from 1997 to the Cour des comptes, eliminating the backlog
accumulated over the years. In turn, the Cour des comptes has evaluated the state accounts for 1997,
1998 and 1999 and i s on the pace to review remaining accounts during the next 18 months.

The evaluation report recommended that the authorities should focus their efforts in the following areas:
(i)
improve wage and human resources management; (ii)
harmonize procedures between projects funded
on internal and external resources; (iii)
accelerate the use o f programmatic budgets in line Ministries; (iv)
improve the preparation and execution o f the investment budget; and (v) strengthen internal and external
controls o f agencies, public enterprises, and local governments. The authorities, and partners, were also
encouraged to launch the Public Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA), as it should provide useful
benchmarks for measuring progress in Senegal over time and compared to other countries. Such an
exercise i s expected to be completed bv October 2007.

3.15 The Senegalese authorities need to be made more accountable for the use o f public
funds by strengthening checks and balances and by disseminating relevant information to
media and interested parties. The Government needs t o ensure that allocated resources reach
their intended final beneficiaries. A recent tracking survey has reported that.only 58 percent o f
teachers could be identified o n active duty, raising doubts about the efficacy o f the system to
educate children. Similarly, leakages and inefficiencies are numerous in the health sector. l6
Efforts to strengthen checks and balances are under w a y through the implementation o f the
C F M C P A R actions described earlier. The Treasury has finalized the consolidated state’s
accounts and recently forwarded them to the General Accounting Court (clearing the significant
backlog). The Court has reviewed these accounts for 1997-99 and a timetable was set up to send
i t s avis de conformitb to the National Assembly for the remaining years. The Court has
relatively limited resources and a Multidonor Trust Fund i s funding short term accountants to
assist in accelerating the review. There i s a need to strengthen the controls o f independent
agencies and public enterprises as emphasized in the recent Public Expenditure Review Update
and the ROSC o n corporate governance produced by IFC in early FY2007. The Government has
also established a number o f n e w institutions aimed at improving governance in b o t h the public
and private sector (e.g., Commission contre la Corruption, Infrastructure Council) but efforts are
needed to make them more effective. Finally, the authorities have taken the initiative to
strengthen information systems and further empower final beneficiaries, notably through the
development o f Community D r i v e n Development (CDD) initiatives supported by the Bank.

ENHANCING
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

3.16 The performance of the private sector has been uneven in Senegal as evidenced by
the decrease in private investment from 17 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 15 percent in 2004
and the relative stagnation of exports, around 27 percent of GDP. This lack o f dynamism i s
also reflected at the micro level since labor productivity o f manufacturing in Senegal, while high
compared to neighboring countries, i s estimated to have declined over the past two decades, and
is today equivalent to one fifth or one third o f those achieved in Korea and South Africa,
respectively.
Job creation has been minimal with the unemployment and under-employment
rates stagnating at around 40 percent o f the labor force. Such a performance needs to be turned
around so that the private sector can play i t s expected pivotal role in the PRS agenda.
3.17 Policymakers face major challenges to improve Senegal’s investment climate and
promote sector development. Streamlining bureaucracy and improving transparency are key
challenges as illustrated by Senegal’s poor ranking in Doing Business Indicators and the Bank’s
recent ROSC on accounting practices by the private sector.” While some specific initiatives
have been launched, a more concerted, broad based strategy is required. The Senegalese
Government finalized i t s new Accelerated Growth Strategy in January 2007, which i s part o f the
second-generation PRSP (see next section for details). This new approach i s expected to help
address hrther cross-sector issues related to the investment climate and promote five specific
clusters that are perceived by the Government to have the highest comparative advantage for
Senegal: (i)agribusiness; (ii)tourism; (iii)telecommunications and new technologies;
(iv) textiles; and (v) fisheries.
3.18 Many surveys, diagnoses and studies, including those emanating from the Bank
Group, have already helped to reach a consensus regarding the major constraints faced by
the private sector in Senegal (Box 3.2).” Building o n recommendations from the Presidential
Investors’ Councils, the authorities have improved the business environment by streamlining
regulations concerning business registration and taxation. In January 2004, the National
Assembly adopted reforms simplifying the corporate income tax and investment codes. The tax
basis was broadened by eliminating several tax exemptions, and a single tax replacing the
income tax, the value-added tax, patent contributions, and social security charges was introduced
for small enterprises. The new investment code broadened the scope o f eligible sectors to take
into account PRSP priorities and i t streamlined the system o f investment incentives.

3.19 Other efforts have been launched to improve access to finance for private firms, which i s
viewed as the most significant constraint for almost two-thirds o f private companies surveyed by
the 2004 Investment Climate Assessment. This constraint is especially significant for SMEs and
micro-enterprises operating in the informal sector, most notably in rural areas, because o f their
lack o f expertise and inability to provide guarantees. This diagnosis was confirmed by the joint
Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP). The Bank has supported reforms in the
financial sector through the ongoing Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) with the
restructuring o f the postal and the pension systems. The restructuring o f the postal system will
help mobilize savings and facilitate access to financing in rural areas through i t s extensive
regional network and the allocation o f remittances (both from Dakar and outside o f the country).
The reform o f the pension system will mobilize long-term savings and deepen the financial
market in Senegal. IFC i s considering investing in two microfinance institutions geared toward
lending to micro-enterprises.
3.20 To enhance private sector development, Senegal will need to: hrther increase
productivity; boost the quality and product m i x o f Senegalese exports; increase productive
innovations; promote supply chains integration; and expand human capital through education
achievements and the use o f expatriates in local production. The following l i s t suggests a series
o f priorities for both the short and medium terms.
3.21 The first priority i s to encourage competition in the formal industrial private sector,
which lacks dynamism and adaptability to the new international environment. In spite o f
the adoption o f the new West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) common
external tariff in 1999 which has streamlined Senegal’s tariff structure and reduced tariffs, this
sector remains protected by high tariffs and non-tariff barriers (such as in the agribusiness
sector). The 2003 Integrated Trade Report recalled that Senegal’s trade regime s t i l l deviates
a 20 percent surtax on imports o f onions,
from the WAEMU framework in important respects: (i)
potatoes, bananas, cigarettes, and rice and a 10 percent surtax on some cereals such as millet and
sorghum; and (ii)798 tariff lines (out o f 5,863) that do not have a tariff line in WAEMU’s
common external tariff. Some local products are further protected by differentiated excise taxes

14

o n imported and local products such as edible oils and cigarettes.20 In some sectors, collusive
behaviors by a few dominant firms have produced significant costs for local consumers, raisin
prices above their international levels (for example, sugar, transportation, and groundnuts). 2 f
Such behavior and weak governance have also led to financial mismanagement in key sectors
(ICs mining and SENELEC electricity). At this stage, the Government will push for the
elimination o f the remaining specific taxes and non-tariff barriers in the sectors mentioned above
and for improved governance in public and private enterprises.
3.22 To foster competition, the Senegalese Government has promoted the participation o f new
private operators, notably in the infrastructure sector. After two failed privatization attempts in
1995 and 1999, in March 2005 the authorities sold the groundnut processing and vegetable o i l
refining company (SONACOS) to the only bidder that made an offer. In the electricity sector,
the Government concluded the process o f selecting an independent private producer (PP) to
increase generation capacity by 67.5 Megawatts (MW) (equivalent to about 14.6 percent). In the
future, the Government will promote higher private sector participation in infrastructure sectors
(transports and energy). A necessary condition will be to improve the accounting and audit
systems for public (and quasi public) enterprises and regulated private operators when there are
residual monopoly powers. An effort will also be pursued to upgrade accounting and reporting
practices in the private sector, along the lines suggested in the recent ROSC produced by the
Bank.
3.23 The second priority i s to support micro and small and medium enterprises, which
account for more than half o f the Senegalese economy. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing
Senegal, as the country attempts to move from economic stability to accelerated growth with
equity, i s to generate sustainable sources o f opportunity for the marginalized groups in society.
This effort will require the expansion o f micro-enterprises and small and medium firms, which
are the main providers o f jobs. Such f i r m s face a variety o f constraints, including lack o f access
to capital, weak technology and labor skills, and poor integration within supplier and distribution
networks. Most small and medium-sized f i r m s do not have access to property rights (including
land) and to inexpensive conflict-resolution mechanisms, due to the lack o f efficiency o f the
judiciary system and complex administrative procedures. There i s no simple answer to these
challenges but they have to be at the center o f the new AGS.
3.24 The third priority i s to optimize the perceived comparative advantage of the
Senegalese economy in a few strategic sectors, and thus promote exports and/or job
creation. The business principle i s to push “what i s already moving” and to give priority to the
sectors that have contributed to two-thirds o f GDP growth in the recent past. Those are by order
o f decreasing importance: communications, trade and financial services, real estate and
construction, and agriculture and agribusiness (Figure 3.1). This focused approach has already
been adopted in the AGS (at least for two sectors) and should be strengthened over the next few
20

A recent Bank study indicates that the sugar sector in Senegal i s under the monopoly o f one company employing
approximately 3,000 permanent employees (plus 2,000 temporaries), which benefits f i o m relatively high protection
levels. As a result, the consumer price o f sugar is about US$1 per kilogram in Senegal, while it i s US$0.4 in Sri
Lanka and US$0.5 in The Gambia. Such a price differential has significant implications for poverty levels in
Senegal since i t i s estimated that the number o f people living in poverty would decline by 200,000 o r by almost 2
percentage points if the sugar price were cut by h a l f o r equal to the one prevailing in The Gambia.

years. Over time, success in these sectors will spread over the rest o f the economy, creating new
synergies and investment opportunities.

3.25 A stronger, more competitive agriculture sector combines the second and third priorities.
Assisting small fanners and entrepreneurs in rural areas is essential because they are among the
poorest segments o f the population and the most exposed to climatic and natural shocks. As a
result, these groups are the main sources o f emigration toward urban centers, especially Dakar.22
The emergence o f new exports (such as fresh vegetables o f which exports boomed by 130
percent between 2003 and 2005) appears promising and should help diversify production and
agricultural exports away from groundnuts. The recent increase in competitiveness o f the
agricultural sector in Senegal i s nonetheless limited to a few locations (Niayes, Senegal River
Valley, and Casamance regions) and products. It is also penalized by complex relationships
between traditional and modern powers that make difficult access to land and discourage site
development because o f the lack o f guarantees and financial resources. Furthermore, resource
degradation is a growing challenge for Senegal, ranging from deforestation to land degradation
associated with poor water resources management and the depletion o f fish stocks. The
Government has set out plans for addressing these issues and the Bank is currently finalizing i t s
Country Environment Analysis, in close collaboration with donors and civil society.
3.26 The fourth priority i s to increase the level of skills and technology used b y the
private sector in Senegal. As mentioned earlier, to be successful Senegal will have to boost and
diversify i t s exports, suggesting that i t s local production in key sectors (such as ICT, exports, and
agriculture) will have to be aligned with quality standards defined by consumers in industrialized
markets. The recent knowledge assessment produced by World Bank Institute (WBI) on Senegal
reveals that i t ranked poorly even among other Sub-Saharan countries (see Table 3.1). Senegal
has improved compared to 1995 but not as fast as other countries. Its main weaknesses appear to
be related to the poor quality o f i t s Research and Development (R&D) institutions and relatively
22

l o w education attainments. Fostering technological development will have to rely on a multifaceted approach involving education establishments and research institutes, partnerships with
private f i r m s (local and foreign), and the State. A specific effort, supported by the World Bank,
has been made by the Government to upgrade the National Fund for Agricultural Research
(FNRAA) and to foster the l i n k s between the education system and the labor market.
Concurrently, actions will have to be taken to upgrade the legal and institutional environments as
well as to promote new channels for information and knowledge dissemination (notably through
Senegalese expatriates, and partnerships with foreign universities and colleges).
3.27 The fifth and last priority i s to take advantage of the presence of many Senegalese
abroad (7 out o f 10 Senegalese families report having one o f their members living abroad).
Senegal already benefits from significant remittances sent home by migrant workers and
expatriates. W h i l e these funds help generate economic growth on a national scale by financing
the purchase o f consumer goods and real estate, they also represent a potential source o f
financing for more infrastructure projects and productive activities on a larger scale. A closer
connection with the local banking system has to be developed to help monetize the economy
since only 10 percent o f the population i s estimated to have a bank account today. The ongoing
reform o f the postal system and sustained growth o f microfinance institutions will help achieve
this goal. In parallel, actions should be taken to reverse the brain drain23 and to motivate
expatriates to bring back new skills and technology to Senegal. The Government has started to
focus on expatriates by launching a combined effort through the Ministry o f Foreign Affairs and
the Investment Promotion Agency (APIX).
4.

SENEGAL’S LONG-TERM V I S I O N AND MEDIUM-TERM P R I O R I T I E S

4.1
The Senegalese Government i s well aware that it needs to achieve more and better
to address the above challenges in the next few years, and thus increase economic growth,
create jobs, and reach the poor. This commitment i s reflected in the second generation
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-11), which was presented to the Board on January 30,
2007, through which the authorities offer their vision for the next five years. At the outset, it i s
worth underscoring that this vision i s well aligned with the MDGs agenda, and its formulation
has benefited from inputs from donors, local Governments and representatives o f the civil
society as well as from the private sector.
Senegal’s medium-term vision i s articulated around four pillars: (i)wealth creation;
4.2
(ii) access to basic social services; (iii)protection of vulnerable groups; and (iv) greater
transparency and participatory processes. The first three pillars were already included in the
first PRSP, while the last one has emerged as a new priority for the authorities. Below i s a
presentation o f the Government’s priority areas. These specific programs show what the
Government i s committed to accomplish.

4.3
B y placing the Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) at the center of the first pillar of
the PRSP-11, the authorities have rightly emphasized the need to encourage private sectorled growth and to expand and diversify exports. The AGS i s based on two key objectives: (i)
An IMF study shows that 60 percent o f African immigrants living in the U S have a tertiary education (source:
W i l l i a m J. Carrington and Enrica Detragiache, “ H o w Extensive I s the B r a i n Drain?, Finance and Development”.
23

17

improving the overall investment climate in the economy by focusing o n a series o f cross-cutting
issues (including in the areas o f justice, taxes, infrastructure, and administrative barriers); and (ii)
promoting the development o f five cluster sectors with a presumed good export growth and j o b
creation potential, including through measures to enhance sectoral competiti~eness.~~
In parallel,
wealth creation will rely on the implementation o f national sectoral strategies for the agricultural
and livestock sectors aimed at promoting activities in rural areas. The PRSP-I1 discusses the
large infrastructure projects that the Government plans to put in place over the next few years,
including the Diamniadio industrial platform, the Dakar-ThiBs highway, and the new airport.
These projects will not only provide the necessary basis for private sector development, but will
also help diversify economic activities away from Dakar and its suburbs (which account for
about 80 percent o f GDP on less than one percent o f the national territory).
4.4
The second pillar based on human development will continue to promote access to
basic social services by a growing share of the population. The implementation o f the national
strategies in the education and health sectors, as well as new commitments to enhance nutrition
and access to sanitization and water are the key elements o f the Government’s strategy.

4.5
The third pillar o f the PRSP-I1 emphasizes the need to improve the lives of
vulnerable groups, an area which has been neglected so far, and prescribes actions to ensure
that these groups benefit from wealth creation and have better access to social services.
Vulnerable groups are numerous and diverse in Senegal, including children, handicapped,
elderly, and refugees. The recent finalization o f the National Protection Strategy has helped build
a consensus on a selected set o f priorities, including the need to increase the coverage o f existing
safety nets, provide direct fillancia1 assistance to targeted groups, and improve the Government’s
capacity to respond to natural catastrophes and shocks. Such a concerted approach has helped
improve coordination between various stakeholders.

4.6
The fourth pillar on transparency and participatory processes i s justified by the
need to strengthen the effectiveness of public spending (through efficient budgetary
procedures and controls) as well as to promote private sector development (through less
distortion and better access to justice). Improvement in governance will be achieved through
reforms in the areas o f capacity building and financial management in the public sector. The
Government intends to pursue implementation o f two action plans supporting public expenditure
management reforms, as a follow up to recommendations o f the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR).
As part o f their objective to improve the quality o f public human resource management, the
authorities have initiated civil service reforms. They will strengthen civil servants by providing
training in education, health, justice, tax collection, and security. Concurrently, the Government
has initiated the implementation o f a series o f reforms in i t s remuneration policy aiming at: (i)
improving the competitiveness o f public wages with respect to the private sector provided
productivity increases and compatibility with macroeconomic stability i s ensured-particularly
in light o f the rapid increase o f the wage bill in recent years; (ii)
simplifying procedures; and (iii)
introducing performance-based incentives. The PRSP-I1 also proposes an agenda o f reforms for
the justice sector, in line with the national sectoral strategy endorsed by key stakeholders in the
country.
24

The five sectors include ago-industry, fisheries, electronic customer support services, tourism, and textiles.

18

4.7
The Senegalese Government has initiated the decentralization o f decision-making
with regard to the management o f human and financial resources, including the strengthening o f
local governments’ capacities and the gradual transfer o f a number o f responsibilities to local
communities, especially in the education and health sectors. I t will pursue the gradual
decentralization o f the execution of the Consolidated Investment Budget, and strengthening
capacity building at the local level, which i s a prerequisite for successful decentralization.
4.8
Beyond the four pillars mentioned above, the Government has based its strategy on a
number o f guiding principles that can be summarized as follows:
(a) Preserve macroeconomic stability and reduce vulnerability to external shocks. The
authorities recognize that maintaining fiscal and external balances is crucial for the
success o f their medium-term vision. They intend to pursue prudent fiscal policies so that
inflation and debt levels will remain in line with the IMF and WAEMU targets. At the
same time, they will continue to give special attention to the management o f external
shocks by developing preemptive instruments, by diversifying export revenues, and by
building up financial reserves to protect the agricultural sector and the most vulnerable
groups.

(b) Promote equity and protect vulnerable groups. N o t only will the authorities aim at
increasing the delivery o f basic social services (education and health), but also at
reducing existing inequalities in their access, which varies significantly depending on the
users’ income levels, gender and location. They will launch a new employment strategy
that should help promote jobs for youth and women. The protection o f vulnerable groups
will remain at the center o f the agenda, reflecting the need to broaden the coverage o f
existing social safety nets beyond five percent o f the total active population, and to secure
better living conditions for important groups o f children, women, elderly, and disabled,
most notably in rural areas.
(c) Balance growth between rural and urban regions. As o f today, most economic activities
(about 90 percent o f GDP) and a large fraction o f the population are concentrated in the
Dakar area, which represents less than 1 percent o f the national territory. Such a
disproportionate outcome has resulted in the deterioration o f living conditions and
infrastructures in the Dakar agglomeration, and has raised issues in terms o f food security
and the environment. The Government has launched a two-fold strategy that aims
simultaneously at improving conditions in the Dakar area and promoting economic
opportunities in secondary cities and rural areas. The delocalization o f economic
activities outside o f Dakar i s under preparation, through the construction o f a new
industrial platform, a toll road highway, and a new airport. The development o f new
investment opportunities in the agricultural sector i s being promoted in the Senegal River
and Casamance regions.
4.9
The Government has stressed the need to increase its capacity to monitor progress
and remove constraints that may emerge over time. The second PRSP, as well as the AGS,
provide the roadmap for the next few years. At this stage, this broad policy framework needs to
be translated into a strategic set of actions, with a precise timetable and clearly assigned
responsibilities, and a full set o f monitorable actions and results with an appropriate pro-poor
focus. The authorities will also need to clarify the link between their strategic choices and
budgetary processes and allocations, not only at the sector level, but also within sectors and
19

across regions. Improved prioritization o f actions, clear leadership by decision makers, and
continued dialogue with donors and stakeholders will be key to a successful implementation o f
the PRSP.
5.

WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE

5.1
The Government and the WBG share a common vision on the overall objectives to
be achieved in Senegal over the next few years. The WBG assistance program will therefore
support the Government’s key priorities identified in PRSP-11. This assistance will nonetheless
be selective and will focus on concrete actions where the WBG has a comparative advantage,
given i t s past experience and other donor programs. The specific activities o f support will be
clustered around one cross-cutting filter and three pillars to maximize impact, enhance synergy,
increase the efficiency o f WBG support, while avoiding fragmentation and providing flexibility
over the CAS period.
A.

LESSONS
FROM PAST EXPERIENCES AND CONSULTATION STRATEGY

5.2
This CAS capitalizes on lessons from the Bank’s past experience in Senegal and
from a series of directions derived from global and regional assessments. With regard to
past experience, the recent IEG evaluation suggests that WBG assistance should aim to:
(i)
strengthen the dialogue and consensus with the Government; (ii)
improve harmonization with
donors; and (iii)
promote synergies between rural and urban areas, notably in the infrastructure
sector. The CAS Completion Report has also identified a number o f lessons (for details see
Annex 2). First, Bank programs must be aligned with government objectives to alleviate
poverty, especially with the fourth PRSP pillar devoted to governance and the need to promote
further decentralization and participatory mechanisms. Second, Bank programs must give
special attention to the design and choices o f lending instruments, including clear, measurable
outcomes. Third, close coordination with the Government and partners i s important, since the
most successful Bank projects have been those that have demonstrated a clear ownership by the
authorities and synergies with other donor programs.
The CAS incorporates guidance from recent experiences at the regional level. For
5.3
example, Senegal has been selected as a pilot country in Sub-Saharan Africa to implement the
Paris Declaration agenda which stresses ownership, harmonization, ali
ent, results, and
mutual accountability as crucial ingredients to maximize aid effectivenesssyThe Bank plays a
key role in assisting the authorities in this regard (see Annex 6). This CAS also incorporates
lessons from the Africa Action Plan, including the promotion o f concrete results, quick wins for
demonstration impact, and a focus on economic growth.

5.4
This CAS accounts for progress made in the management of the existing Bank’s
portfolio in Senegal. The number o f projects and the portfolio composition have remained
relatively stable over the FY03-06 CAS period (about 20 projects under supervision in a given
fiscal year), with support to infrastructure (55 percent), agriculture and rural development (23
percent), human development (16 percent), private sector development (12 percent), and
economic management (4 percent). By end FY06, there were no active projects rated as
25

20

unsatisfactory and commitments at risk declined to US$65 million from a high o f US$210
million in FY03. The overall control risk26 for Bank-Funded projects was rated as “moderate” in
February 2006, emphasizing the need to (i)
address the project accounting and internal control
framework before effectiveness; (ii)update regularly the necessary actions to be taken during
implementation; and (iii)
improve the quality o f the audit reports transmitted (which remains the
main issue).
5.5
Consultation strategy. The Bank, in full coordination with the Government, held a
series o f consultations with various segments o f civil society and development partners in
Senegal (see Annex 6 for details). The consultations started at the end o f April 2006, and
culminated in a one-day seminar in Dakar in mid-June 2006. A preliminary version o f the CAS
was also presented in the quarterly journal published by the Bank’s office in Dakar and benefited
from a wide coverage from local media. In parallel, thematic consultations o n each specific
pillar were organized to encourage a discussion o f issues that are o f particular importance to a
wide range o f stakeholders, such as governance (notably through the G A C consultations). The
Bank, in close coordination with the authorities and in line with the Paris Declaration agenda,
also launched a survey o f donors operating in Senegal. The survey has helped to identify:
(i)
current and planned disbursements; and (ii)
ideas for strengthening cooperation with the
Government and coordination among donors. The results, summarized in Annex 7 have helped
shape the new PRSP and this proposed CAS program.

B.

PROPOSED BANKPROGRAMS AND EXPECTED
OUTCOMES

5.6
The proposed C A S platform for FYO7-10 i s based on one governance filter and
three main pillars. This platform aims not only at addressing the country’s challenges but also
at maximizing synergies with the Government’s PRSP and the Bank’s AAP by using the WBG
comparative advantage. The CAS seeks continuity with the ongoing reform programs, while
moving gradually toward a more programmatic approach. I t also promotes selectivity by leaving
aside some key aspects o f the PRSP agenda, such as support to the livestock sector, the banking
sector and telecommunications, which are likely to benefit from assistance from other donors
during the CAS period. The WBG i s expected to be engaged through active partnerships with
the private sector and other donors, including in the water and road sectors. In other sectors,
complementarities are sought in terms o f lending instruments with, for example, the Bank
providing budgetary support in the health sector, while other donors focus on investment
projects. The reverse i s planned in the education sector where the World Bank will carry
forward an investment project in FY07 and C I D A a budgetary support operation.
GOVERNANCE
FILTER

5.7
Strengthening governance i s widely recognized as an essential element for the
success of the development strategy in Senegal. Such a focus is crucial for improving public
service delivery --the first key challenge identified earlier. Weaknesses have emerged in public
financial management systems over the past few years, such as the growing use o f non26 Control risk i s the risk that the project’s accounting and internal control frameworks are inadequate to ensure that
project hnds are used economically and efficiently and for the purpose intended, and that the use o f h d s i s
properly reported.

21

competitive procurement procedures in public contracts (almost 60 percent o f projects funded by
domestic resources) and mismanagement in public and quasi-public enterprises (e.g., in the
energy sector and the largest industrial firm operating in Senegal) has led to the accumulation o f
substantial debt over the past year.27 Strengthening governance will also be crucial in the effort
to promote private sector development by strengthening the legal and institutional frameworks in
areas such as land, property rights, labor, and environmental policies.

5.8
The governance filter will work in two ways in the WBG strategy: First, the proposed
emphasis will help improve the efficiency o f sectoral operations and mitigate their risks. Some
examples o f the cross-cutting impact o f this filter are, inter alia: (a) fiduciary reforms o f the
State, by strengthening budgetary procedures and securing better financial transfers across
sectors, will help to improve the efficiency o f the Bank’s lending operations in the education and
agricultural sectors; (b) better involvement o f local governments, through the development o f
participatory processes, will help optimize the spending allocation and the delivery o f basic
infrastructures throughout regions; (c) improved functioning o f the justice system will impact
significantly the development o f the private sector, through better access to land and financing two major constraints in the current business environment in Senegal. Second, the inclusion o f
governance aspects in the design o f sectoral projects will contribute to improve overall
transparency in Senegal. Examples o f such an approach can be found in paras. 5.28 and 5.40.
5.9
Overall, the WBG will use three guiding principles to ensure that governance
considerations are mainstreamed into its programs in SenegaL
1.

Greater transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources

5.10 There are several constraints to achieving greater transparency in the use o f public
resources that will be addressed during the CAS period. The WBG will support the removal o f
these constraints through lending support, targeted assistance through the use o f trust Funds, and
Analytical and Advisory Work in key areas, in partnership with the Government, civil society,
and donors. These constraints and related Bank support are described below.
5.1 1 Ensuring transparent public expenditure management and procurement procedures
at both the central and local levels. The C F M C P A R action plans have been instrumental in
placing this item on the agenda o f both the Government and donors over the past few years.
Progress was realized in: (i)
budget preparation through programmatic budgeting in seven key
ministries at end 2006; and (ii)
budget execution through decentralization from the Ministry o f
Economy and Finance to line Ministries. Coordination between the Government and donors has
been enhanced by the creation o f the Multi-Donor Trust Fund which aims at improving capacity
building in the above areas. Coordination continues to be a key factor with the preparation o f a
new Public Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA), to be carried out jointly by key donors in
FY07. The Bank will continue to support this effort through a series o f ongoing and planned
budgetary support credits. Concurrently, a number o f initiatives have been undertaken to reduce
the risk for investment operations. These include: (i)
assistance to the accountancy and auditing
professions through an IDF grant (to be effective in FY07);28 and (ii)further collaboration
between the Bank and the Ministry o f Economy and Finance to improve the internal audit

function and evaluate better the need for closing risky projects. Over time, the gradual move
toward programmatic budgets in all key ministries, as well as a more rationalized preparation o f
the investment budget,29 will enhance coordination across sectors and will lead to a better
budgetary allocation across ministries and regions.
5.12 Strengthening control institutions for the sustainability of effective governance.
Although the preparation o f the budget and i t s approval by the Parliament come under scrutiny in
Senegal (the budget i s published on the Government’s website), ex-post controls by the judiciary
and the legislative power are deficient. The Bank will provide support to the Supreme Audit
Institution (Cour des comptes) to ensure that executed state accounts are examined in compliance
with international standards, including regional regulations. Concurrently, public accountability
will be increased through a sustained effort to strengthen the role o f Parliament and civil society
in overseeing and controlling the use o f public resources. In particular, these efforts will take
place through the WBI program. The involvement o f civil society will be further encouraged
through the establishment o f anti-comption hotlines in Dakar and in the regions. A special
emphasis will be given to strengthening compliance with the 2001 environmental law and
regulations. The outcome sought i s that investments in Senegal are systematically screened
according to existing regulations, and monitored for environmental compliance by the
Government,
5.13 Promoting higher quality of public administration. The effectiveness o f the
Government in using public funds will largely depend on its capacity to manage i t s human
resources and boost labor productivity. The Bank aims at providing both financial and analytical
support by placing this item at the center o f i t s next series o f poverty reduction support credits
and by making i t the central theme o f the Public Expenditure review planned for FY08. The
Bank will support pilot projects in the education and health sectors to provide performance-based
incentives and motivate key staffs to locate in underserved regions. Further reforms based on the
recent audit o f the wage bill will improve transparency and modernize the payment system.

2.

Increasing public sector accountability

5.14 Enhancing delivery of basic services through devolution to local governments and
empowerment of communities. Experience has shown that public sector accountability i s
increased when decision makers are closer to beneficiaries, thereby justifying the shift toward
greater decentralization in Senegal. Yet, the central Government s t i l l controls close to 90 percent
o f public resources even though significant spending responsibilities (especially in the health and
education sectors) were assigned to local Governments back in 1997. Clearly, the
decentralization process needs to be pushed ahead based on the need to: (i)
reinforce capacity o f
improve the relations between the central and local Governments.
local Governments; and (ii)
The first objective is and will be supported by several Bank-financed operations, including the
Participatory Local Development Program and Local Authorities Development Program that aim
to provide support to local governments in delivering a basic platform o f basic social and
infrastructure needs. The second objective i s part o f the PRSC program through two concomitant
actions: (i)
the decentralization o f the execution o f the investment budget; and (ii)
increasing and
more predictable financial transfers to local Governments, leading to the adoption o f a new law
29

See recommendation from the 2005 “Bank’s Public Expenditure Update”.

23

by Parliament in January 2007. In parallel, the gradual increase in' financial resources allocated
to local Governments should be accompanied by stronger financial management and
procurement procedures at the local level as well as reinforced independent controls and audits.
5.15 Strengthening institutions responsible for fighting corruption and promoting good
governance in the public and private sectors. Over the past few years, the Government has
established a variety o f public/private institutions with the aim o f increasing public sector
accountability. The Bank program will put special emphasis o n the Infrastructure Council
responsible for ensuring that all PPPs are in conformity with the BOT law. This would be in line
with IDA projected support to private sector participation in the Dakar-Diamniadio Highway
project and in the electricity sector. Strengthening the institutions responsible for implementing
the new procurement code will be supported by the Bank through technical assistance (IDF
grant) and will continue to be integrated into the PRSC agenda. The Bank and other donors will
also monitor the performance o f the Commission against corruption because i t is viewed as a key
channel to foster public-private partnership and to send a positive signal to local and foreign
investors about the Government's commitment to fight corruption. The Bank is also expected to
support the authorities in improving controls over public agencies and public enterprises, which
have suffered from lack o f governance over the past few years. This will be done through the
PRSC program and targeted assistance in infrastructure sectors.
5.16 Improved communication and information strategies. Monitoring mechanisms are a
critical element in improving accountability. The Government has given a new impulse to this
agenda by creating the National Statistical Agency in early 2006. The Bank and other donors
will actively support data collection through a new household survey and will help the
Government to improve its capacity to monitor PRSP implementation. In parallel to increasing
statistical monitoring and collection capacity, information and communication channels between
the public and private sectors as well as other stakeholders will be enhanced by distance learning
programs envisaged on critical issues such as PPPs, in close collaboration with the Government.
The Bank plans to enhance i t s outreach program, including the quarterly publication o f i t s
journal (Echos de la Banque mondiale) and periodic meetings with the media and civil society.
3.

Strengthening and modernizing the judicial system and mechanisms for private
governance

5.17 Encouraging respect for the law and access to justice. The PRSP has emphasized that
a better environment for justice will not only promote economic growth but also favor a more
equitable distribution o f wealth within the country. Aware o f the deficiencies in the current
system, the Government finalized a sectoral strategy at the end o f 2004 that calls for a long-term
capacity building program and greater financial resources, notably through the national budget.
The objectives o f this program include: improved performance o f courts, accelerated processing
o f cases and making judgments available to the general public to enhance consistency and
transparency. This program would also expand access to courts for the most vulnerable groups,
and thus generate greater empowerment o f the poor. As a result, the budgetary allocation to the
justice sector has doubled from 2002 to 2006. The Bank has supported this effort through the
ongoing PRSC series, leading to improvements in the institutional framework and the adoption
o f a new law that aims at streamlining legal assistance to the most vulnerable groups. The Bank
also plans to provide assistance to the Government through a judicial sector project starting in

24

FY08, which will build fuller capacities in this sector and foster synergies with other sectors. A
well functioning justice system will create a variety o f positive externalities in terms o f economic
growth, human development, and equity.

5.18 Strengthening commercial courts and conflict resolution mechanisms. The recent
Investment Climate Assessment conducted by the Bank revealed that the large majority o f f i r m s
operating in Senegal have little confidence in the judicial system and existing conflict-resolution
mechanisms because o f the lack o f transparency and slow decision processes. The Bank
supports the Government in addressing these issues through i t s Private Investment Promotion
Project, which provides assistance to the company’s register and to the development o f
alternative arbitration mechanisms through private sector associations. Technical assistance i s
and will be provided by the Bank and IFC, including on the issue o f land access that penalizes
severely investors in specific sectors such as agriculture and tourism.
5.19 Improving compliance with international accounting and audit standards. The large
majority o f f i r m s (mostly SMEs) operating in Senegal are reluctant to use standard accounting
practices because they do not have the internal capacity and the right incentives to use them.
Recent distress in public or quasi-public enterprises (such as ICs, the largest industrial plant in
the country) has revealed weak independent financial controls and audits. The WBG has already
conducted a ROSC on accounting practices that has identified several options for improvements
(simplified procedures, enforcement, and publication). The WBG has undertaken a ROSC on
corporate governance, including a section on State-Owned Enterprises, in coordination with the
authorities, that has recommended to draft a code o f corporate governance for Senegal and to
strengthen monitoring and controls o f public enterprises by reinforcing their board o f directors
and generalizing independent and periodic o f their accounts. Following these recommendations,
IFC will be designing PEP Africa programs to assist the authorities.

5.20

Encouraging competition in strategic sectors. WBG support during the CAS period
will focus on two interrelated outcomes. First, emphasis will be given to increasing private
sector participation in the electricity and road sectors. This support will be at the center o f the
planned Dakar-Diamniadio highway project and the central element o f the dialogue in the
electricity sector. Second, the Bank will continue to push the agenda for greater international
competition by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers in key sectors such as the groundnut and
sugar sectors. A more encouraging investment climate, by lowering entry barriers, will be
supported through assistance to the Investment Promotion Agency (APIX) and the
implementation o f the Accelerated Growth Strategy, notably through the PIPP project. WBG
assistance will be provided, not only through the country program, but also at the regional level
since these issues are largely dependent on WAEMU regulations.

TH
THE DRIVERS
OF GROWTH
5.2 1 Strengthening poverty reduction will require greater emphasis on the domestic
growth environment since an annual GDP growth rate of at least 7 percent i s viewed as one
of the prerequisites for reaching the MDGs. Such an emphasis is also at the center o f the
AAP, supported by the WBG. The CAS will seek to address Senegal’s growth constraints by
focusing on a series o f specific outcomes taking into account: (i)
PRSP and AAP objectives; (ii)
25

key challenges identified earlier for the promotion o f private sector development; and (iii)
WBG’s capacities and comparative advantages. These outcomes as well as the instruments
designed to support them are described below.
1.

Promoting a competitive investment climate

5.22 The CAS plans to support the implementation o f a competitive investment climate
in Senegal through a series o f analytical and financial initiatives. O n the analytical side,
I F C E I A S will support the authorities in addressing existing administrative barriers that f i r m s
face when they want to establish themselves and operate in the country. This will be done by
sharing the Doing Business methodology and indicators. The Bank will support the
implementation o f Senegal’s Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) through the ongoing Private
Investment Promotion Project (PIPP) and a planned new operation in FY09. A new Investment
Climate Assessment i s expected to be conducted in FY08, which will help to monitor progress
over time. Furthermore, the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) will focus on the current
constraints on employment and the development o f skilled labor in Senegal. MIGA is assisting
APE to target potential investors by conducting a benchmark study comparing advantages and
obstacles in key export sectors in Senegal. Over time, Senegal should be able to attract more
investors (local and foreign) as well as to boost and diversify its exports.
2.

Building and maintaining basic infrastructure for growth

5.23 Senegal lags in terms o f the development and quality o f its road and electricity
networks, which in turn reduces the competitiveness o f its private sector. The CAS will aim
at assisting the Government in i t s effort to upgrade the access o f f i r m s to these two basic
infrastructures through a series o f ongoing and planned projects. On the road sector, the Bank
and I F C will provide financial support to the Dakar-Diamniadio Project, which i s viewed as a
central element o f the Government’s program to promote private sector participation in this
sector. An integral part o f the design o f this PPP i s the provision o f an I F C Partial Risk
Guarantee, which will help mobilize private sector finding, and therefore limit
public/multilateral resources. Over time, the CAS will seek to enhance policy dialogue through
new sectoral projects (AGS, Transport 111, the Senegal River Multimodal Navigation Project, and
the Regional “Mauritania-Senegal-The Gambia” Integration Project), especially on the crucial
improve the quality o f the rural road network (through adequate maintenance); and
needs to: (i)
(ii)
develop road corridors between Senegal, Mauritania and The Gambia.
5.24 The Bank Group has been actively involved in the energy sector through ongoing
projects in the rural sector (electricity services for rural areas project) and in supporting the
construction o f a new generation unit as a means o f alleviating the overextended power supply in
the country (electricity sector efficiency enhancement project and I F C financing o f the
Kounoune project). This support is embedded in the medium-term sector strategy which sets
clear objectives in terms o f price regulations and restructuring o f the national electricity
company, SENELEC, including private sector participation. CAS support in this sector will be
strengthened to assist the authorities in implementing their strategy by developing a new project
(the final choice of the type o f instruments i s not yet determined) in FY08, subject to the
availability o f additional IDA resources. This new project will aim at providing budget support
to SENELEC , increasing power production, and supporting the institutional and legal reforms in
the sector. As noted in para 5.8, this will help support government efforts in strengthening the
26

environment for improved governance. At the regional level, the ongoing Senegal River Basin
Organization (OMVS) Felou Hydroelectric Project aims at increasing the supply o f l o w cost
hydroelectricity from the O M V S Power System to the national power utilities o f M a l i (EDM),
Mauritania (SOMELEC) and Senegal (SENELEC).
5.25 Access to modern information and telecommunications infrastructure i s viewed as
essential for Senegal’s future economic development, notably for the success of the AGS.
Over the past few years, this sector has led Senegal’s good macroeconomic performance,
accounting for about one-third o f GDP growth over the period 2000-03. The CAS will seek to
continue to support this sector through the ongoing PIPP, centering on policy, regulation and
institutional reforms.

3.

Facilitating access toJinancia1 resources by small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs)

5.26 T o support the reforms o f the financial sector, a close collaboration i s envisaged
between the Bank, IFC, and MIGA. To facilitate lending to SMEs, MIGA has launched a
Small Investor’s Program (SIP) that offers a three-point country risk package (Expropriation,
War & C i v i l Disturbance, Transfer & Inconvertibility) on a streamlined basis for investments
under US$5 million. Concurrently, MIGA, the International Development Association (IDA),
and the Agence Frangaise de Dkveloppement (AFD) are working towards implementing a joint
Guarantee Facility in the context o f the West Africa Capital Market Development Project, which
was approved by the boards o f the World Bank, and AFD in 2004. Such a facility i s designed to
be a catalyst for the private financing o f small and medium-sized infrastructure projects in
WAEMU countries, and to mitigate critical Government performance risks, which currently
constrain the interests o f investors. The Guarantee Facility seeks to speed up the processing, and
lower the cost o f access to these instruments for relatively small projects. The development o f
the financial sector will also rely on two ongoing regional projects: (i)
the regional payment
system project with the introduction o f the real time settlement system for large transactions and
the regional financial markets
electronic clearing has modernized the payment system; and (ii)
development projects will facilitate the recourse o f Senegalese f i r m s to the regional market by
significantly reducing costs (replacement o f obligation o f a 100 percent guarantee by the rating
o f issuers, reduction o f transactions costs) and contribute to the development o f PPP
infrastructure projects through partial guarantees. Senegal is the first country to benefit from
such a guarantee within UEMOA (for a rural electrification project).
5.27 One of the options contemplated by the Government for improving access to finance
has been the introduction of new financial instruments adapted to the needs of SMEs. The
Bank’s ongoing PPIP project has involved two local commercial banks for which I D M I F C PCG
i s provided on their new loan portfolio to SMEs. Similar facilities are being discussed with other
donors to cover SMEs in the education, housing, and agribusiness sectors. I F C funded a leasing
market study and seminar to determine the feasibility o f investing in a leasing company in
support o f SMEs. Senegal’s tax treatment o f financial operations has hindered the development
o f efficient private sector financing mechanisms and has no positive impact o n fiscal revenues.
A review and simplification o f the fiscal regime o f financial operations is under consideration by
IFC, as i t would encourage more efficient financing o f the economy.

27

4.

Promoting a modern and diversiped agriculture sector

5.28 The WBG has traditionally given special attention to the agricultural sector in
Senegal because it i s the major occupation of close to 60 percent of the active workforce.
However, declining productivity and lack o f diversification in production have led to rising
poverty, which in turn has fueled high emigration to cities over time. Bank support over the
CAS period will cover three major areas. First, the second phase o f the Agricultural Service and
Producer Organization project (PSAOP 11) will support the establishment o f a network o f
producer organizations and advisory services in all rural areas, facilitating producers’ access to
agricultural services and knowledge, with the ultimate goals o f increasing agricultural
productivity and diversification and improving household food security. Bank financing will
also help to prepare a medium term expenditure framework for the Ministry o f Agriculture and
the Ministry o f Livestock from year 2008, as part o f Bank support to Government efforts in
strengthening governance, as noted in para 5.8. Along the same lines, support to infrastructure
and basic social needs in rural areas will be provided through the Participatory Local
Development Program. In parallel, the Agricultural Markets and Agribusiness Development
Project will promote access to regional and international markets through the development o f
efficient supply chains in a few selected activities (e.g. horticulture and non-traditional products),
in line with the AGS. The planned regional project (Senegal River Multimodal Navigation) will
help finance the modernization o f St. Louis waterways, and entry o f agricultural exports from the
Senegal River Basin. Recent studies have indeed demonstrated that Senegal’s agricultural sector
is penalized by deficiencies in the logistics chain from the farm to consumer markets (in urban
centers and abroad).30
5.29 The second area will emphasize access to water and irrigation by farmers through the
ongoing Agricultural Markets and Agribusiness Development project and the regional Senegal
River Basin Multipurpose Water Resources Development project.
5.30 The third element seeks to improve the sector’s productivity by increasing the
quality of production, especially of groundnuts. Bank support i s provided through a variety o f
projects, including the ongoing Agricultural Services and Producers Organizations (PSAOP2)
and planned initiatives such as the GEF supplemental to the PSAOP under the S L M program as
well as the regional Biosafety project and West African Agricultural Productivity Program
(WAAPP). The Bank aims at helping Senegal to achieve the following two outcomes: (i)
reconstitute the groundnut seed capital to at least 50,000 tons by 2010; and (ii)improve the
quality o f non-traditional export products up to the standards o f consumers in industrial markets.

5.

Promoting sustainable development and management of natural resources

5.31 The fisheries sector employs 10 percent of the rural population and generates 30
percent o f exports. However, this source o f employment and revenue i s threatened because o f
declining fish stocks, resulting from overcapacity and overfishing. The Bank will provide
support over the CAS period through the ongoing Integrated Coastal and Marine Resource
Management Project (GIRMaC), to improve the management o f small-scale fisheries, in close
cooperation with partners (Japan, European Union, France, Switzerland, Spain). In parallel, the
GIRMaC will support a recasting o f the framework for protected marine areas and biodiversity
30

See for example, “Recent Development in Infrastructure”, the W o r l d Bank Group, Private Sector Unit, 2005

28

management around the principles o f co-management and the provision o f ecological services.
With supplemental financing under the Global Environment Facility (GEF) sustainable fisheries
management, the Bank will strengthen the regulation o f access to fish resources and implement
the presidential decision to establish 10 new marine protected areas. Finally, the Bank will
support the preparation o f a regional fisheries project in partnership with the West Africa
Fisheries Commission (WAFC), the European Union (EU), Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), and Department for International Development (DFID), to reduce illegal or “pirate”
catches, increase local landing o f catches and strengthen small-scale fisheries.
5.32 I n a country like Senegal, with relatively few natural resources, sustainable
development i s a priority. Such a priority is reflected in the Bank’s proposed program over the
CAS period. The ongoing Country Environmental Analysis will help to define better the issues
at stake and pave the way to closer collaboration with the Government and partners. In addition,
the Bank will provide support to the objective o f improving the sustainability o f agro-ecological
systems in rural areas, in close coordination with partners (Netherlands, France, Norway, UNDP,
TerrAfrica, etc.) and thanks to a GEF/Sustainable Land Management (SLM) supplemental to
PSAOP2, with a focus on reversing land degradation in regions such as Tambacounda,
Velingara, and Kolda. Finally, Bank support during the CAS period will also aim at establishing
community forest management units to f i l l y meet household wood fuel needs in the country by
2010. These efforts to develop sustainable energy sources in rural areas have already been
actively supported by the Bank through the Sustainable and Participatory Energy management
(PROGEDE) project, with a second phase expected to start in FY09.
6.

Developing skilled labor and use of technology

5.33 Developing a knowledge economy i s one of key objectives of the ambitious agenda
set up by the AGS. Bank support during the CAS period will be sequential, with a first phase
under the CEM, especially in terms o f the enhancement o f skilled labor and the capacity o f the
labor force to absorb and adapt new technologies. The second phase will be to integrate the
derived recommendations in the planned support to the AGS in FY09. This support will
complete the ongoing assistance provided through the PRSCs to improve the functioning o f the
labor market, with an emphasis on vocational training through private-public partnerships. I t
will also boost the research agenda in the agricultural sector, supported by the ongoing PSAOP2.

PILLAR 2: HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT/~OCIAL
SERVICES/SHARED GROWTH
5.34 Increasing access and opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups, as growth
performance i s improved, i s at the heart of the Senegal’s PRS agenda. N o t only is equity
crucial for ensuring social and political stability but i t i s also a key ingredient for achieving longterm economic growth as demonstrated by the Bank’s 2006 World Development Report. The
Bank’s contribution will include a m i x o f financial and analytical support in the education and
health sectors as well as in the areas o f the protection o f vulnerable groups.

29

I.

Improving quality of and access to basic education

5.35 Senegal i s in a good position to meet its MDG target of achieving universal primary
education completion by 2015. The Bank has had a long-term involvement in this sector, and
will continue i t s support through the ongoing Quality Education for All, Phase 2 project, in close
coordination with other development partners operating in this sector. During the CAS period,
the first main objective will be to improve quality and access to primary education, notably by
identifying and enrolling children currently not in school, and reducing gender and regional
disparities that remain prevalent in Senegal. The Bank program will also aim to reduce the
number o f repeaters and dropouts through an active collaboration with the Government and civil
society associations; a special effort will be made to expand access o f street children to
education, among other things. The second objective will focus on attaining higher enrollment
rates in middle schools, notably by ensuring a better allocation o f budgetary resources toward
this level o f education. Such an objective will complement the ongoing and planned efforts in
vocational training, and research and development supported by the PRSC program, which
ultimately aim at producing a better educated labor force in Senegal over time. Improving
financial and human resources management in this sector will be supported by the ongoing
sectoral investment project and the ongoing and planned PRSC series, both o f which give special
attention to: (i)budgetary procedures, including procurement; (ii)improved human resources
decentralization across sectors but with a special attention to the education
management; and (iii)
sector, which i s one o f the largest ministries in terms o f spending. All these activities will help
support Government efforts toward improving the environment for better governance, as noted in
para 5.8.

2.

Improving health services provision for women and children

5.36 The second phase o f the national health strategy aims at addressing current
constraints on both the supply and demand sides as well as improving accessibility,
effectiveness, efficiency, quality and sustainability of health services, including in remote
areas. These objectives have been fully integrated into the Bank’s PRSC series, and have and
will be complemented by other investment projects in this sector, including the ongoing MAP
and APL community nutrition projects 11. A series o f technical assistance projects and ESW are
also planned so that the Bank can share i t s experience and help build local capacities in this
sector.
5.37 During the CAS period, the Bank will aim at assisting the Government to achieve
five outcomes. The first outcome will seek to increase adequate financing, provision and
utilization o f health services by: (i)
achieving better service delivery through performance-based
contracts at all levels with specific emphasis on health districts; and (ii)increasing human
resource productivity in all facilities (notably through better human resource management).
the PRSC; (ii)
a study o n the effectiveness o f
Financial support will be provided through: (i)
health financing strategies (in FY08); and (iii)
technical assistance through a program conducted
by WBI on contracting and financing in the health sector. The second outcome, which i s at the
center o f the PRSC program, aims at reducing maternal mortality by increasing the number o f
assisted births, with an emphasis on the five poorest regions. The third and fourth outcomes are
to reduce two o f the main (current and potential) sources o f morbidity and mortality in the
country: maintain the rate o f HIV prevalence below three percent and reduce by one-third the

30

numbers o f malaria deaths. In addition to the PRSC series, the Bank has and will support the
authorities through the ongoing HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control project, the Senegal River
basin project, and the Nutrition Enhancement I1 project. The fifth outcome i s to reduce child
mortality below 13 percent during the CAS period through a series o f actions aimed at reducing
underweight malnutrition rates in children under 5 years old, in line with the MDGs and the
PRSP objectives.
3.

Improving protection of targeted vulnerable groups

5.38 The PRSP, which fully integrates the recent national social protection strategy,
emphasizes the need to improve the lives o f vulnerable groups, and i t prescribes actions to ensure
that these groups are effectively able to benefit from wealth creation and have access to social
services. The Bank will support the Government in this area through a variety o f programs.
First, the Bank has already integrated the issue o f vulnerable groups into the design o f sectoral
projects in the agricultural, health, nutrition, and education sectors. For example, support to
farmers contributes to the reduction o f poverty levels, as most o f the poor are concentrated in
rural areas. Similarly, a better educated and healthier workforce is more likely to be productive
and employed, thereby reducing their vulnerability. Beyond these sectoral projects, the PRSC
program i s and will actively help the authorities in developing specific programs in favor o f
(i)
the disabled, through community based rehabilitation programs; and (ii)
specific vulnerable
groups, through improved access to social protection and health insurance schemes. A Poverty
Update and a new Poverty Assessment are expected to be produced in FY07 and FY09
respectively. Last, but not least, as described in the next section, this support in favor o f
vulnerable groups will be complemented by fbrther assistance to help emigrant and immigrant
groups.
PILLAR 3 :RURAL
AND URBAN SYNERGIES: URBANIZATION/MIGRATION

5.39 At the current pace, it i s projected that almost six out of ten Senegalese will be living
in cities by the year 2015. This rapid pace o f urbanization raises a key challenge for the
authorities who will need to find the right balance between urban and rural development. To
support the Government, the WBG will shape i t s program along three areas, as summarized
below.

1.

Improving urban mobility, access in and out of Dakar, and promote
regional centers

5.40 Optimizing rural and urban synergies through the development of the road network
takes into account three key priorities: (i) improving urban mobility within Dakar; (ii)
facilitating access in and out Dakar; and (iii)developing rural roads. The WBG will assist
the authorities during the CAS period through a variety o f ongoing and planned lending
operations, in close collaboration with partners. First, improving urban mobility will continue to
be supported by the Local Authorities Development Program Project (PRECOL) and the second
phase o f the Urban Mobility Improvement (PAMU)/Transports I11project to be started in FY09.
Second, the challenge o f improving access conditions in and out o f Dakar will be supported by
the Bank’s financial assistance to the Dakar-Diamniadio highway and the provision o f an I F C
Partial Risk Guarantee. Third, Bank support in developing and maintaining rural roads will be
integrated in the planned PAMU/Transport 111, and through partnership with AFD in the Senegal
31

River Valley, and EU in Southern Senegal. They aim at promoting access to a minimal
infrastructure platform (health, education, and water, and roads) in rural areas through increasing
participation o f local Governments and communities. As part o f the Government’s ambitious
project to decentralize industrial activities outside o f Dakar, in close coordination with the above
mentioned highway project and the industrial platform to be funded by the Millennium
Challenge Account, analytical advice i s provided on the new airport project. The Bank will
stress that the above investment operations be carried out under conditions o f transparency to
help promote Government efforts towards improved governance.

5.41 The WBG also plans to provide support to the development o f regional centers,
especially in the regions o f the Senegal River through the regional project Senegal River Basin
Multipurpose Water Resources Development and the planned Senegal River Multimodal
Navigation Project. Support to the Casamance region is provided through the ongoing
Casamance Emergency Project. This latter project aims at rehabilitating social infrastructure
(health centers, classrooms, roads) affected by the conflict in the Southern part o f the country.
2.

Reducing the vulnerability of immigrant and emigrant groups with a focus on
street children in Dakar

5.42 Rural emigration has shaped Senegal’s economic and social development over the
past three decades. Massive emigration to cities has been the result o f the increasing
vulnerability o f the rural population, which has seen i t s income decrease significantly over time.
Support to farmers i s provided through two ongoing sectoral projects (Agricultural Markets and
Agribusiness Development Project; and Agricultural Services and Producers Organization 11).
The Bank will also provide analytical support to the Government by launching a series o f studies
aimed at identifying actions to reduce the vulnerability o f the rural population to major natural
risks (such as weather-based and crop insurance schemes) and to better understand non-farm
employment issues. Furthermore, the objective o f improving learning outcomes in rural
communities, especially in the groundnut region, has been stressed by the Bank’s project in the
education sector. The Bank, in close coordination with the authorities and partners, will also
address the growing phenomenon o f street children in urban areas through the PRSC series, a
national outreach program, and the Nutrition Enhancement I1project. The main outcome will be
to reduce the vulnerability o f street children, as measured by the decline in the number o f
working children in the Dakar area, by facilitating their insertion in schools and skills
development programs. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and a subsequent
employment strategy note will also help identify further directions in addressing the issues o f
unemployment and under-employment in Senegal, including for women.
3.

Improving quality of life through better management of natural resources and
access to water and sanitation

5.43 The concentration of the Senegalese population in urban centers raises multiple
issues in terms of environment and quality of life. Cities such as Dakar have become more
polluted, leading to higher environment-related diseases in children. There is a need to
strengthen compliance with environmental regulations in Senegal and monitor the Government’s
activities for environmental compliance. Further problems also arise, ranging from unsustainable
land management to waste management and provision o f food and water. During the CAS
32

period, the WBG will focus its assistance in the following areas: (i)
reducing environment
health-related diseases in children; (ii)improving the implementation o f environmental
regulations with a focus on the Baie de H a m that i s highly polluted as the result o f uncontrolled
reaching MDGs in terms o f access to water and sanitation services
industrial activities; and (iii)
by 2015, with a special focus o n rural areas. Senegal will receive both financial and analytical
support through the ongoing Country Environmental Analysis, the GIRMaC, GEF/SLM
supplementals to PSAOP2, and planned lending support in the water sector, including at the
regional level through the Water and Sanitation Millennium Program.
S U M M A R Y OF M A I N OUTCOMES TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE CAS P R O G R A M

5.44 For the WBG, overall success should be measured in principle by the contribution
o f the CAS to high order national goals: (i)
higher GDP growth in the range o f 7 percent; (ii)
reduction in poverty levels, notably in rural areas, along the lines o f the first Millennium
Development Goal; and (iii)
the capacity to generate more and better jobs, leading to a decline
by h a l f o f unemployment and underemployment rates. However, these goals are not directly
measurable over a short period o f time and are influenced by several factors that are outside o f
the control o f the Government and the Bank.
5.45 Table 5.1 summarizes the main outcomes that the WBG aims to achieve by the end
o f the CAS period and will help Senegal progress toward PRSP indicators and MDGs. I t i s
nonetheless worth underscoring that they were selected through an intensive participatory
process and are well aligned with PRSP objectives and MDGs. They also account for: (i)
areas
in which the Bank i s expected to influence results through its lending and non-lending programs;
and (ii)
interventions by other donors to maximize synergies. As much as possible the selected
outcomes rely on monitoring instruments used independently by the Bank (in the AAP such as
CPIA ratings, WBI governance indicators and PEFA benchmarks) and by existing projects in
Senegal. Additional details are in Annex 1, which describes the results framework.

from 65% o f the population in 2005 to 70% in 2009,
and to (ii)
sanitation from 19% in 2005 to 28% in 2009.

5.46 As a tangible step toward achieving these medium-term outcomes, the proposed
CAS recognizes the regional dimension o f Senegal’s development as well as the importance
o f enhancing gender development and building local capacity. Senegal i s a key player in
West Africa and i t s economic development will largely influence and be influenced by existing
and potential synergies with i t s neighbors. Several regional operations and analytical works are
envisaged in the energy sector, the promotion o f the Senegal River area, the road sector with the
development o f corridors with Mauritania and The Gambia, and social sectors through regional
initiatives in health (Malaria, Avian epidemic flu) and education (network o f tertiary education
and research institutes).

5.47 Success in the development o f Senegal will also greatly depend on i t s capacity to
promote women, not only in terms o f providing them social protection and equal access to social
services (education, health) but also in securing them more and better jobs (Box 5.1).
Box 5.1: Gender Development in the CAS
Gender development i s a key element o f CAS support in Senegal in various dimensions. First, the
WBG will support the authorities in their effort to promote j o b creation and s k i l l development for
women through the implementation o f the new national Employment Strategy (through the next
C E M and the PRSC series). It will also promote credits to women entrepreneurs and associations,
mostly in rural areas, through the IFC/IDA partial guarantees schemes. Second, the Bank
assistance in the education and health sectors will include specific activities targeted at women,
such as increasing enrollment o f girls in primary and secondary schools and improving maternal
health. Third, gender equity will be at the center o f the agenda aimed at increasing the protection
o f vulnerable groups through the restructuring and extension o f existing social security systems
and targeted financial assistance programs.

35

5.48 Last but not least, the focus on capacity building i s justified because, in the absence
of natural resources, Senegal’s future economic development will be shaped by the quality
of its labor force and entrepreneurs (training, education, knowledge dissemination) as well
as the effectiveness of its public administration (civil service reform, strengthening
institutions, decentralization, etc.). This focus i s envisioned in the following four dimensions:
(i)
development o f human resources that cut across several areas (e.g., education programs and
vocational training as supported in the Education for All I1project and the PRSC program); (ii)
enhancement o f specific skilled occupations (doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers, etc.) through
ongoing and planned projects in the these sectors, the use o f Trust Funds, and targeted AAA
work; (iii)
support to capacity building on governance issues including the justice sector (through
the planned Judicial Governance Project) and institutions recently built to enhance transparency
in both the public and the private sectors (such as the Cour des comptes, the Commission against
corruption, and the institutions responsible for the implementation o f the new procurement
Code); and (iv) support to local Governments through the ongoing and planned C D D operations.

c.

DELIVERY OF THE BANK’S
ASSISTANCEPROGRAM

5.49 The proposed CAS will aim at maximizing the impact of the WBG’s assistance in
Senegal through: (i)
the use o f various financial instruments such as budget support, single
investment projects, and community driven development initiatives; (ii)
maximizing synergies
within the WBG; and (iii)
leveraging financial resources beyond the country allocation through
partnerships and donor coordination.

5.50 Modalities and lending instruments. The WBG will use various mechanisms to deliver
i t s program o f assistance. Such a diversification i s consistent with the objective o f increasing
mutual accountability and aligning disbursement procedures with national systems. It i s also
effective in enhancing cross-sector externalities in areas such as budgetary and financial reforms,
decentralization, and the protection o f vulnerable groups. I t i s also key for improving the
performance o f social sectors, which are highly dependent o n factors that are not under their
direct control (for example, health-related issues in urban areas are related to the lack o f access
to sanitation and water, which are partly the result o f high immigration rates).
5.51 The WBG will continue to deliver investment projects for a variety o f reasons. First, in
spite o f recent progress and the central place given by the WBG to the improvement o f the
Government’s budgetary procedures, severe weaknesses remain, most notably in terms o f
procurement and ex-post controls. This explains the continued use o f implementation units, with
the view to gradually phasing them out. Second, investment operations are often considered as
more effective in financing infrastructure work (e.g., roads and energy) and in providing
technical support at the sectoral and local levels (e.g., justice and education). The Bank’s
portfolio will also rely on CDD-type operations, which aim at increasing empowerment o f local
communities and final beneficiaries, and strengthening the decentralization process.
5.52 To increase further the effectiveness o f Bank support, output-based approaches are being
piloted in the water and the rural electricity sectors. These will be evaluated during the CAS
preparation process and, based on their results, will be extended to other activities.

36

5.53 Synergy within the WBG. Following the recent trend, IFC/IDA joint projects will
continue to be privileged, notably in the areas o f infrastructure (energy and roads) and access to
finance. Reliance on alternative financial instruments will also reinforce the coordination within
the WBG since most these instruments are expected to be provided by I F C and MIGA, under the
form o f guarantees or facilities. MIGA can mitigate perceived political risks o f private sector
projects, and work directly with investment-promotion agencies, as it did with APIX during the
previous CAS period, to develop PPPs and increase FDI flows. Extensive collaboration with
IFC, which provides financing to the private sector and advisory services to Government and
private operators, including SMEs, will enable the Bank to increase its private sector
IFC
development impact. Such synergies will be developed through the following examples: (i)
program o f partial guaranty on banks bond issuance with local banks to provide medium-term
funding for on lending to SMEs; (ii)
MIGA Small Investment Program (SIP) provides guarantees
against risks o f expropriation, war and civil disturbances, transfers and inconvertibility; and (iii)
MIGA West African Development Bank (BOAD) facility for small infrastructure projects.
5.54 Partnerships and donor coordination. Because o f i t s strategic role, and i t s good
development outcomes, Senegal’s development program has benefited from large foreign aid
support. Most bilateral and multilateral development agencies have an active presence in
Senegal, with the Bank, the European Union, France and the United States being the largest
contributors. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in harmonizing development
assistance in Senegal. These harmonization efforts are consistent with the principles articulated
in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and in the AAP. It has led to a close collaboration
in the design o f budget support operations, including the Bank’s PRSC. Further coordination i s
expected through the adoption o f a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU), setting up common
evaluation processes o n the macroeconomic conditions, the PRSP progress, and public sector
management reforms. At the sectoral level, an explicit effort was made by the Bank’s to foster
joint projects with other donors in the infrastructure and urban renewal, the rural sector
operations and the Education SWAP. At the end o f 2005, 8 out o f 16 o f IDA-supported
investment projects were co-financed with other donors, which i s much higher than the average
in Senegal (one out o f four projects).
5.55 Nevertheless, as described in Annex 7, progress s t i l l needs to be made on several fronts,
including better coordination among donors that should lead to a reduction in the number o f
projects and improved alignment with respect to PRSP priorities. For example, the protection o f
vulnerable groups (PRSP third pillar) only benefited from marginal attention from donors. There
i s also a need to share information on current and h t u r e projects to improve the predictability o f
aid flows over time and maximize complementarities between donors and the Government as
well as among donors. Seeking partnerships will be at the center o f the Bank’s agenda over the
next few years. A s part o f the implementing the Paris Declaration agenda (of which Senegal has
been chosen as a pilot country), consultations within the donor community have been launched
on a formalized framework for Government-donor co-operation, including joint analytical work.
5.56 Promoting partnerships with the Government and local research groups will be
encouraged by the Bank’s program to facilitate ownership, sustainability, and dissemination o f
knowledge.

37

D.

LENDING
AND THE AAA SUPPORT PROGRAM

5.57 The CAS proposes a lending program which will aim to optimize the WBG’s
assistance given government priorities and donor collaboration (Table 5.2). The program i s
based on a total envelope o f IDA resources o f US$420 million over the four-year CAS period or
an average o f US$l05 million a year. Given that IDA-15 resources are yet to be determined, i t i s
assumed for simplicity, that the level o f IDA resources during the IDA-15 period will correspond
to the level under IDA-14. Actual allocations during the CAS period will be determined on an
annual basis and will depend on: (i)
total IDA resources available; (ii)
the country’s performance
rating3’; (iii)
the performance o f other IDA borrowers; (iv) the number o f IDA-eligible countries;
and (v) terms o f financial assistance (grants or credits).
5.58 The IDA financing over the CAS period will be constrained, partly as the result of
the recent multilateral debt reduction initiative (MDRI),32 justifying the search for
alternative channels to help increase the financial impact of the WBG lending program.
The first channel, as explained earlier, will be to conceive Bank projects in a way that
systematically maximizes scope for parallel or co-financing with donors as well as private
participation, especially in the infrastructure sector, including under the innovative toll-road
project, and for PPs. The second channel will be to explore the possibility to access additional
funding in FY08 through scale up initiatives in the Africa region..

5.59 The proposed lending program aims at balancing the WBG’s assistance across the
three key pillars and the governance filter. Support to the three CAS pillars is aggregated in
Figure 5.1, based on the existing portfolio o f operations and a tentative lending program for
FYO7-FY10. I t shows that the Bank’s portfolio will be equally divided between pillars Iand I11
(with a share o f 44 percent and 40 percent o f total lending respectively), while pillar I1 will
receive about 16 percent o f the Bank’s assistance over the CAS period. This allocation reflects
the capital-intensive infrastructure projects in the urban infrastructure, energy and water sectors
and not a bias against human development and shared growth. I t also takes into account (i)
the
growing Government’s financial involvement in human development; almost half o f the budget
i s now allocated to social sectors, and (ii)
the constructive dialogue to improve the efficiency o f
these expenditures. The WBG will continue to actively support the education and health sectors
and plans to be increasingly involved in the protection o f vulnerable groups through its
budgetary support and community driven initiatives.

5.60 The FY07 lending program includes PRSC-I11 and investment projects to support
infrastructure, decentralization, and social sectors. PRSC-I11 will continue to provide support to
five main priorities o f the PRSP: (i)
budgetary reforms; (ii)
decentralization; (iii)
health sector;
(iv) wealth creation with a focus on the labor market and reform o f the judiciary sector; and (v)
the protection o f vulnerable groups. The second phase o f Quality Education for All I1 and the

31

IDA country allocations are based o n the country performance ratings (CPR), which is based o n CPIA ratings,
country portfolio ratings, and governance indicators.
32 While Senegal benefited f r o m debt relief under the MDRI, this initiative has reduced the IDA envelope by about
US$20 m i l l i o n per annum. A second factor that limits financing in FY08 i s that IDA resources were significantly
frontloaded in FY06 and FY07 t o finance operations that had been planned under the last year o f I D A 1 3 (FY05) but
could not be funded due to resource constraints that year.

38

Local Authorities Development Program I1 have been launched.
project includes support to the regional Malaria Booster.

A nutrition enhancement

5.61 In FY08, the lending program will be limited due to (i)the strategic choice o f frontloading the Bank’s IDA 14 program in FY06 and FY07; and (ii)
lower than anticipated IDA 14
resources as the result o f the MDR Initiative. The Africa Action Plan stresses the importance o f
leveraging other sources o f financing. In that context, funding o f the Diamniadio-Dakar
highway project will be sought, including possibly through the catalytic fund (together with an
I F C guarantee o f about US$30 million). Funding for the Energy Sector Rocovery operation will
depend on continuing strong performance and availability o f additional IDA resources in FY08.
In the absence o f such additional resources, the FY08 lending program would be adjusted
accordingly and no lending would be possible in that year,
5.62 In FY09 and FY10, Bank assistance will include the start o f the second PRSC series,
which i s expected to become the key WBG’s instrument to sustain human development in
Senegal, including the protection o f vulnerable groups. In parallel, a lending operation should be
launched to support the Accelerated Growth Strategy, following the closing o f ongoing projects
(PIPP and PSAC). The alternative option would be to include such a support in the PRSC
program and thus consolidate the Bank’s portfolio in Senegal. This strategic choice will be made
following the first result o f the implementation o f the AGS and the finalization o f the Bank’s
analytical work to be carried out in the C E M (early FY08) and the Technical Assistance
provided by MIGA and IFC. The Bank will support the enhancement o f governance in Senegal,
by a sectoral support to the justice sector which will help build capacity and the development o f
infrastructure with planned projects in the electricity and sustainable energy, water, and
transportation sectors. These projects will seek to support the authorities in their efforts to
improve access to better infrastructure, especially in rural areas, and to achieve the geographical
diversification o f economic activities outside o f the Dakar area. The second phase o f the Urban
Mobility Improvement 11, to be launched in FY09, will help improve urban mobility and living
conditions in Dakar. A number o f regional operations would also be prepared aimed at
promoting transportation and integration between Senegal and i t s neighboring countries.
5.63 Non lending program. The CAS includes a core program o f AAA aimed at supporting
the Government’s vision as well as optimizing the WBG’s support over time. The Bank’s
labor
Economic and Sectoral Work (ESW) i s expected to be focused on three mains issues: (i)
market and productivity (including education and vocational training); (ii)protection o f
vulnerable groups (notably youth and street children and in rural areas such as in the groundnut
basin); and (iii)
fiscal policies, expenditure efficiency, and civil service reforms. Incollaboration
with IFC and WBI, other analytical studies are expected to be carried out on the development o f
the knowledge economy, the regional housing finance market, and a review o f the fiscal regime
o f financial operations.

Trust Fund should help finance new studies on vulnerable groups and systematic risks in the

carried out by all donors providing budgetary support.
5.65 An explicit effort will be made to increase local ownership and dissemination o f
knowledge in Senegal. Training provided by WBI will continue in the following areas: (i)
high
level policy seminar to mobilize leaders around critical issues and share international experience;
(ii)
parliamentary strengthening; (iii)
regulation and public-private partnerships in infrastructure.
Partnerships with local institutions will be encouraged along the lines o f the joint collaboration
between WBI and the Centre d’Etudes en Politique de Dbveloppement (CEPOD). The recent
MOU signed between the World Bank and the Regional Training Institutions in Financial
Management (CESAG) should help disseminate best practices in financial and human resources
management to public administration both at the central and local levels.

6.3
Poverty studies that became available after the completion o f the previous CAS indicate
that the degree o f poverty reduction was greater than had been estimated, but with greater impact
on the urban population than on the rural one. Nevertheless poverty in Senegal remains high and
there i s no room for complacency if the poverty MDG i s to be attained. Bank support o f the
growth agenda under the previous CAS constitutes an appropriate response, and benefits from
added emphasis under the new PRS and the proposed CAS. In addition, there have been notable
efforts to reinforce the impact o f public expenditures on the poor, notably through fiscal
decentralization and enhanced social protection, which will be sustained and deepened under the
proposed new WBG program.
6.4
The debt sustainability risk has been reduced to negligible levels. Having reached the
HIPC Completion Point in April 2004, Senegal now benefits from MDRI and enjoys a
significant fiscal space that has led to the financing o f core programs without excessive reliance
on foreign borrowing. Moreover fiscal expansion, mainly large infrastructure projects in the
Public Investment Program, are being financed through o w n resources, the private sector, and
grant and concessional financing. Future debt service is projected to remain l o w and at
sustainable levels.
Emerging Risks

6.5
There are several possible risks associated with the implementation o f the CAS and the
Government’s PRSP and AGS, which can be grouped into three main categories: (i)
governance
and resistance to policy reforms from vested interests; (ii)
vulnerability to political, economic,
and other internal or external shocks, and volatility o f donor support; and (iii)insufficient
capacity to implement reforms and sustain growth.
The challenges o f improving governance. Vested interests and rent-seekers have
6.6
formed significant obstacles to reforms in the past. Recent presidential and forthcoming
legislatives elections in the country have reinforced this tendency, as policymakers have been
more interested in their political survival than in implementing the longer-term economic reform
agenda. Influential groups have thus undermined policies, notably in the energy sector and
parastatals such as ICs, leading to a financial crisis in these two sectors and affecting the size o f
the overall public (and quasi-public) deficit. Funding o f political parties and election-related
expenditures have been longstanding unresolved issues in democratic nations, rich and poor.
The mitigating factors in place include parliamentary oversight over public expenditures and
stricter observation o f procurement rules. The application o f the Building-Operation-Transfers
(BOT) law also provides a transparent framework for private-public partnership.

6.7
Encouragingly, experience has shown that the first part o f the mandate o f a new
administration, much o f the CAS period, provides a good opportunity for bold reforms in both
policy and governance areas. The many dimensions o f governance range from public finance
management issues to enabling a good investment climate through public accountability and the
ability o f the judicial system to empower its citizens, by enforcing the rights and deliver fair and
consistent judgments. Based on ongoing dialogue in these areas, the proposed CAS supports
improved transparency and governance in Senegal by mainstreaming these issues in Bank
projects and programs, notably as a centerpiece for the PRSC. Improved monitoring and
evaluation systems ensure that the goals are being attained over time.
43

6.8
Vulnerability to internal and external shocks. Thanks to the robustness o f regional
monetary arrangements, the relatively comfortable fiscal situation, and Senegal’s other
geographic and other advantages, the risk o f significant macroeconomic slippage in the form o f
unsustainable inflation or sustained negative growth i s minimal. There is the more insidious risk
o f stalled growth and/or vulnerability to natural disasters and external shocks, such as the 2002
drought when GDP growth declined to 1.1 percent, the locust invasion in 2004, continued o i l
price increases, the recent flood in the Dakar region (August 2005), and the possible avian flu
pandemic. The Government and donors have been able to respond through the funding o f
remedial actions. While volatility o f donor support could also have a negative impact, this risk i s
not considered significant and i s largely mitigated by MDRI.
6.9
An internal risk concerns lack o f economic diversity. The limited formal private sector
also increases the vulnerability o f the Senegalese economy to terms-of-trade shock. The CAS
has placed an emphasis on channels aimed at reducing this risk by providing assistance to the
agricultural sector and vulnerable groups that are the most exposed to these natural shocks. I t
also puts a major emphasis on enabling private sector-led growth.
6.10 Senegal i s vulnerable to regional instability. In Casamance, with a minority o f rebel
groups s t i l l not signatory to the peace accord, military action picked up in MarcWApril 2006.
Nevertheless, the Government remains committed to seeking political and economic solutions.
Political instability in neighboring countries has and i s likely to continue to affect the economy.
There i s also a risk associated with deterioration in regional policies on key areas such as trade
policy, infrastructure projects, and financial and competition policies. Senegal’s progress will
depend on sustainable progress in these areas because o f the limited size o f i t s local market and
significant economic regional externalities within WAEMU and ECOWAS. To this effect, the
CAS supports further regional integration.
6.11 Capacity constraints. Achieving the CAS and PRS objectives could become more
difficult as a result o f insufficient administrative capacity in Senegal, shortages o f skills and slow
program implementation. This risk i s highest at the sectoral level and in local Governments,
even though the authorities have been allocatin more resources to this objective, especially in
their new PRS. To mitigate this risk, the WBG and other donors have increasingly given more
attention to this issue by consolidating their strategy toward local communities and providing
direct support to key sectors such as education, health, and governance. Pay and civil service
reform would also help in the retention o f expertise.

B.

PERFORMANCE
MONITORING
& EVALUATION

6.12 The measurement of results i s an essential component o f improved mutual
accountability and mitigated risks. The WBG will primarily depend on three complementary
channels to monitor CAS progress over time.
6.13 The first channel i s to use the current PRSP institutional framework for the
compilation and verification of results and milestones. This framework i s built around four
working groups representing the main actors operating in Senegal: (i)central Government
33

M o s t recently in the context o f work o n the capacity pillar o f the AAP.

44

ministries and agencies; (ii)
local governments; (iii)
civil society and the private sector; and (iv)
donors. These four groups are coordinated by the PRSP unit, which report to both a technical
Committee chaired by the Minister o f Economy and Finance and an Interministerial Committee
chaired by the Prime Minister. This framework has been operating for the past two years,
fueling the design and preparation o f the new PRSP. The WBG has played a central role in cochairing the donors’ working group.
6.14 The second channel i s to continue to review the Bank’s portfolio on a quarterly
basis, in close collaboration with the authorities and implementing agencies, to identify
current constraints and future issues. Such reviews are one o f the reasons explaining higher
disbursements ratios over the past few years, as pointed out in the CAS Completion Report
(Annex 2). Once a year, those reviews will be complemented by a more detailed evaluation
exercise o f the Bank’s portfolio, including with the participation o f major stakeholders operating
in Senegal.
6.15 The third channel i s to closely monitor the results framework proposed in Annex 1
in the areas supported by the CAS. A set o f intermediary indicators or milestones has been
identified that should help evaluate progress over time, including the CAS progress report
scheduled for early FY09. This monitoring will be reinforced by the series o f AAA defined in
Table 5.2.

7.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

7.1
The next four years will be critical for Senegal. The country has made significant
progress by achieving political and macroeconomic stability, maintaining a strong fiscal position,
and defining a clear medium-term vision in i t s PRSP strategy. The next step for Senegal will be
to reach the level o f emerging countries by taking full advantage o f i t s institutions and people.
This will require a sustained effort in man-made areas such as governance, Government efficacy,
ease in doing business, and the inclusion o f vulnerable groups to ensure that growth i s shared
over time. The WBG will continue to provide full support for Senegal’s efforts to these ends.

Annex 2: CAS Completion Report FY03-FY06
Period covered by CAS: June 2002-

Date o f CAS: March 5,2003
June 2006
Date o f Completion Report: October 2006

Prepared by: Ronnie Hammad

Introduction

1.
The Senegal CAS Completion Report assesses the impact and effectiveness o f the 2003
CAS in achieving i t s intended results between FY03 and FY06. W h i l e the initial CAS period
was FY03 to FY05, the Country Director agreed to assess, when possible, the impact for an extra
year due to finalization o f the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) only in October
2006. Furthermore, due to delays in the effectiveness o f a number o f projects and the extension
o f 10 projects, the availability o f information through ICRs only recently became available.34

2.
The 2003 CAS was based on three pillars that mirror those o f Senegal’s first PRSP: (i)
wealth creation; (ii)capacity building and promoting social services; and (iii)
improving the
living conditions o f vulnerable people. The fourth pillar o f Implementation o f the Strategy was
not evaluated since it was part and parcel o f each pillar and was presumably meant to emphasize
the country management priority. This CAS was prepared prior to the advent o f the results-based
approach and thus an attempt was made to retrofit the results matrix to assess progress.
Baselines were taken primarily from Project Appraisal Documents and ISRs, and outcomes were
obtained primarily from ICRs or ISRs for current projects. Sector data was inserted where
available, though no direet attribution i s being made that project interventions contributed to
sector or country outcomes or MDGs. This report benefited from internal consultations with
selected country team members and from a broader discussion with the full country team, the
Government, and project coordinators between June and October 2006.
3.
The CAS completion report concludes that the Bank’s assistance to the implementation
o f Senegal’s first PRSP through FY03-FY06 has been moderately satisfactory. Under the
wealth creation pillar, the Bank program supported the government’s good macroeconomic
performance where average annual GDP growth during the period was around 6 percent, tax
revenues increased dramatically, even while marginal income tax rates on capital investment
declined from 45 to 28 percent, significantly improving fiscal space. Progress in agriculture
exports and reforms in trade and price liberalizing have been mixed. Improvements in the
investment climate have been modest as evidenced by the lack o f progress in the score o f Doing
Business. The record o f privatization has also been mixed, succeeding in water and sanitation,
airline, railroad, but less so in electricity and the Port o f Dakar.
34 A number o f reports and diagnostic studies have informed the preparation o f t h i s report: the Independent
Evaluation Group (IEG) Country Assistance Evaluation FY94-FY04, (2006); IEG Project Evaluations;
Implementation Completion Reports, Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) o f projects that are
ongoing; the I M F Ex Post Assessment o f Longer-Term Program Engagement; Quality Assurance Group Reports;

Under capacity building and support for social services, the substantial investment in
water and sanitation provided much needed services, attracted private investment, and made the
sector more financially viable. This success story i s likely to help Senegal achieve i t s M D G s in
this sector. In the education sector, Senegal i s also likely to achieve its MDG o f primary
enrollment rates; though a number o f quality and equity issues remain in the sector. Major
policy reversal in higher education set back a key reform. Preliminary efforts to build the
capacity o f the Health and Education ministries to manage and implement reforms were not
successful but recent improvements occurred through the use o f the series o f Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs). Access to health services have not expanded as much as anticipated
and Senegal i s unlikely to achieve i t s MDGs in this sector. Progress in combating HIV/AIDS has
been mixed, with some success in setting up national institutions, but utilization o f V C T services
has been slow to meet expectations (even though significant progress was achieved in 2006).
The record for transportation and urban mobility has been mixed. A significant bottleneck,
Dakar and other major cities suffer from extreme congestion with long delays in road work.

5.
On support to vulnerable groups, the Bank has been successful in building the capacity o f
local governments and communities in implementing projects that have improved service
delivery and economic activities targeting the neediest. The nutrition program is a major success
story in Senegal, managing to exceed i t s key targets o f reducing malnutrition through a complex
multi-sectoral approach involving difficult behavior change interventions. I t places Senegal in a
very small league o f Sub- Saharan African countries likely to attain i t s MDG for nutrition.

6.
Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory and i t continues to play a key role in
policy discussions. Relations between the Bank and Government have improved over the past
two years, and i t s ability to bring disparate players together and create consensus in key reforms
continues. I t has also managed to mobilize and leverage significant amount o f donor resources.
Portfolio management has also significantly improved in recent years, with commitments at risk
and the number o f problem projects practically eliminated.

Context o f the CAS

1.

Senegal Medium term Strategy

7.
The finalization o f the first PRSP in June 2002 was an important step forward in
launching a comprehensive development strategy focused on poverty reduction in Senegal. The
strategy was built on four main pillars: (i)
wealth creation through economic reform and private
capacity building and development o f social services; (iii)
improvements
sector development; (ii)
in the living conditions o f the poor; and (iv) implementation o f the strategy and monitoring o f its
outcomes.
K e y strategic elements o f the strategy were:
Promote good governance and strengthen the rule o f law;
Reinforce local development by strengthening decentralization and good governance;
Accelerate the development o f basic infrastructure to enlarge access to services and to
develop human capital;
Increase investment and competitiveness o f the productive system, by investing in
infrastructures that support production;
Pursue regional integration and international cooperation;
Provide information for development and encourage the use o f modem research and new
information technologies;
Rational management o f natural resources and the environment for sustainable
development; and
Assist vulnerable groups and to reduce gender inequalities.
PRSP implementation.
_.
As summarized by the authorities in their two PRSP Progress
Reports in 2004 and 2005,35 progress in the implementation o f the strategy has been unequal.
The authorities emphasized the progress realized in strengthening the first pillar with appropriate
macroeconomic policies, improvements in the investment climate through tax, regulatory and
administrative reforms, and structural reforms in the groundnut sector. Yet, they also recognized
that further improvements are needed to foster a sustained rise in private investment and exports.
Concerning the second pillar, they pointed to progress in health and education, but at a pace
(especially in health) that might not be sufficient to attain the MDGs. The authorities also
emphasized their need to consolidate fiscal transparency, as well as strengthen internal and
external budgetary controls. Regarding the protection o f vulnerable groups, they reported that
increasing funds were allocated to support children and women, but that there were gaps in
programs supporting handicapped and elderly, as well as the development o f infrastructure
benefiting the poorest segments o f the population. The mixed performance o f Senegal i s
reflected in i t s uneven gains toward reaching the long-term MDGs (as reported in Table 2.3 o f
the main text).

Economic Developments, Growth and Poverty Trends

35 See www.irnf.org, www.worldbank.org,: “Senegal-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Annual Progress Report”
and “Joint Staff Advisory Note”, November 11,2005.

10.
Macroeconomic performance. Over the past decade, real GDP grew on average by
about 5 percent annually, marking the first sustained increase in average per capita growth in
Senegal since independence. Economic performance was strong in 2004 and 2005 but i s
expected to be weaker in 2006. W h i l e industrial activity slowed down as o i l prices rose, the
impact on the overall economy was limited due to the dynamism o f the telecommunication and
construction sectors. Inflation remained subdued, with the annual average CPI rising by about
0.5 percent in 2004 and about 2.0 percent in 2006, reflecting the l o w weight o f energy in the CPI
basket and limited rise in some food prices owing to abundant supply.
11.
Although the overall fiscal deficit increased to 3.3 and 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2004 and
2005 and i s expected to attain close to 5.7 percent o f GDP in 2006, the fiscal stance remained
consistent with the authorities’ goal o f preserving debt sustainability. The good revenue
performance has helped to compensate for higher than expected current and investment spending
as well as significant transfers to the energy sector.36 Recent economic performance has been
associated with a widening o f the current account deficit from 6.0 percent o f GDP in 2002 to
over 12.0 percent o f GDP in 2006. This deterioration was driven by strong domestic demand,
mainly from the public sector, higher than expected energy imports, and lackluster export
Performance. However, substantial private capital inflows, combined with debt relief, helped to
maintain the level o f net international reserves o f the Central Bank.
12.
Poverty trend. The latest household survey indicates that the share o f the population
living in poverty decreased from 67.9 percent in 1994 (61.4percent o f households) to
57.1 percent in 2001 (48.5 percent o f households), to 54 percent in 2004. This trend represents a
significant achievement by both historical and regional standard^.^' This positive evolution
needs to be qualified on three accounts: (i)the number o f poor households remains extremely
high in the country, notably in the rural areas where 2/3 o f the poor are located; (ii)
the decrease
was larger in Dakar and other urban centers than in rural areas; and (iii)perceptions o f poverty
show a disconnect with these results, since two-thirds o f households identify themselves as poor
and one-third o f poor and non-poor alike, feel that poverty has substantially increased in their
community over the last five years.
C.

Evaluating the Results of the 2003 CAS

13.
The 2003 CAS was organized to support three key PRSP pillars: (i)
wealth creation; (ii)
strengthening the delivery o f social services; and (iii)
improving the protection o f vulnerable
groups. While the 2003 CAS had a l i s t o f Results Indicators in Table 8, along with indicative
indicators in paragraph 159-161, most o f these indicators relate to M D G s or are high level
outcomes that by definition cannot be attributable to any intervention by either the Bank program
or project. This i s partly because Bank projects are often part o f a larger sector strategy and i t is
impossible to isolate each donor’s contribution to that strategy or result. At best, it can be said
that Bank interventions contribute to some o f the factors that influence these high level
36 The latest evolution of Senegal’s public finances i s analyzed in the recent “Public Expenditure Review Update”,

outcomes. While an effort was made to highlight sector level data in each o f the tables, one
should caution against making generalized inferences that project outcomes contributed directly
to sector outcomes or country outcomes such as MDGs.
14.
In early 2006, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) prepared a Country Assistance
Evaluation covering 1994-2004. The report concluded that “the Bank’s strategy during the
period was relevant to Senegal’s situation.’’ It added, however, that a significant shortcoming
was the assumption that urban-based development would spread into rural areas which did not
address the urban-rural inequities in access to health, education, water and sanitation. These
shortcomings, however, were mitigated in large part by the successful implementation o f PNIR
and the rural electrification project. W h i l e the issue o f governance was highlighted, the Bank’s
efforts focused largely on public financial management, procurement and judicial reform, which
as the report highlights are difficult issues to tackle and the Bank has limited experience in
addressing worldwide.
Pillar I:Wealth Creation

15.
Support to PRSP Pillar Iwas seen as essential to promote economic growth and diversify
activities as a channel to reduce Senegal’s vulnerability to external shocks. The emphasis was
given to the following outcomes: (i)
promotion o f agricultural/primary sector activities; (ii)
support to improving the investment climate/ business environment; (iii)developments o f
electricity infrastructure; and (iv) maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework. The overall
evaluation ranges from unsatisfactory (outcome 3) to satisfactory (outcome 4). The description
o f the expected CAS outcomes, progress indicators and lessons learned are summarized in Table
2 below.

Overall agricultural growth grew b y a modest 1.8 % per
year between 2000 and 2005, with a significant dip in
2002 and strong recovery in 2003. The overall share o f
agriculture to GDP, however, i s declining.

The development objective o f exporting 10,000 tons o f
fruits and vegetable has been exceeded. Senegal managed
to diversify i t s fruit and vegetable export base, product
lines and shipment modes. Studies conducted over the l i f e
o f the project (impact studies o f 2001 and 2003, and
economic and financial analysis in 2004) confirm the
importance o f the sector for the economy as a whole (e.g.,
in terms o f efficient use o f domestic resources) and
contribution to revenues and employment, particularly in
rural areas and among women.

satisfactory in education and health. In the last sector, the Bank initiated i t s assistance with a series o f
sectoral projects, followed i t s inclusion in the budgetary support (PRSC) which has contributed to
improve the performance in this sector. Improving governance has been at the center o f the PRSC series,

ISSUES
AND LESSONS

The overall strategy has been to establish a framework
for achieving universal primary education by: (i)
increasing coverage & equity through the expansion o f
primary & lower secondary enrollment, especially girls
and children in under-servedregions; (ii)
improving
quality & internal efficiency o f primaryhecondary
through the reduction o f dropout and repetition rates, esp.
in mayunder-served areas thru school grants, pilot
primary education in national languages, improving
teacher training; and (iii)
strengthening capacity for
decentralized management through improved financial
and budget management systems and programs for
teacher career management.
For the QEA, the objective to implement a framework
for quality education was achieved. Senegal was able to
maintain a sustainable increase in terms o f access to
education through constructing sufficient number o f
schools, recruiting required number o f teachers,
transferring enough responsibilities for managing the
education sector to decentralized departments. These
efforts were sustained by a favorable budget allocation to
primary education.
The objective in terms o f primary school enrollment
was achieved and will allow Senegal to reach its MDG in
this sector. Primary school completion rate improved
from 36.5% in 2000 to 53.9% in 2005 but remains l o w by
international standards. Enrollment in early childhood
development programs improved considerably, from
2.7% in 2000 to 6.8 percent in 2005. School construction
program was successful overall.
A t the secondary and higher education levels, few
significant results were in evidence. The main issue has
been slow and non-systematic implementation o f the
strategy. Progress has been uneven and masks
urbadrural and gender disparities.
Higher education project rated unsatisfactory due to
policy reversals after new elections in 2000 and 2001.
Highly political, strong vocal constituency for free
university and payment o f scholarships that favors a few
relatively privileged university students. The national
university was built for 5000 but now hosts over 50,000,
at the expense o f quality.

ISSUES
AND LESSONS

While four projects were prepared during the C A S period
t o address a-range o f health intervention, two o f them
were completed with unsatisfactory ratings.
In the first project ( the Integrated Health Project), clinics
and health centers were built, but access to health
services did not improve significantly and the rural poor
were not reached, partly because o f lack o f coordination
and leadership within the sector. Even though local
capacity remains a major constraint, using national
capacity rather than P I U worked well.
Second, the endemic disease project designed to alleviate
burden o f endemic & epidemic diseases among
populations ( malaria, schistosomiasis and
onchocerciasis) suffered because o f weak country
ownership and was designed in isolation o f the health
sector strategy.
The third project in the Bank program was aimed t o
prevent the spread o f H I V / A I D S by reducing
transmission among high risk groups; expand treatment,
care and support for PLWH. Universal access t o VCT
has almost been achieved, prevention and mother to child

regions was achieved; but utilization i s s t i l l limited. HIV
prevalence, though l o w in the general population (0.7% )
remains high among vulnerable groups such as
commercial sex workers (20%), tuberculosis patients
(10%) and m e n having sex with m e n (21%). Three
regions also continue t o experience the highest HIV
prevalence in the country (about 3% in Ziguinchor, K o l d a
and Tambacounda) and need continued attention and
specific strategies. The project succeeded in setting up
the structures (NAC) and (NAS) and in expanding
national response in key ministries (Health, Education,
Youth, Labor, Family, Armed Forces, Industry, and,
Women Entrepreneurship); Grants were allocated to over
600 c i v i l society projects.
The fourth project was the series o f PRSC-I and I1 that i s
supported the Government’s effort to achieve results in
the health sector. Immunization o f D T 3 (for chidren
between the ages o f 12-23 months) was a big success,
having increased substantially f r o m 40% in 2000, to 70%
in 2003 to 93% in 2005. A s such Senegal has already
exceeded i t s MDG for immunization o f 85% by 2015.

sector has maintained i t s

The Bank has made a substantial and long term
investment in the sector since 1998. The objective o f the
Water Sector Project (WSP) was the creation o f an
enabling management framework t o attract a private
operator, increase efficiency and improve service
delivery. The project included a capacity building
component targeting key institutions and institutional
restructuring.
By 1995, the g o d . established a regulatory framework
that put a private company (SDE) in charge o f water
service delivery under a 10 year lease contract, and a
public asset-holding company (SONES) responsible for
managing sector assets, investments planning and
financing. The Government also created the National
Office o f Urban Sanitation (ONAS) as an autonomous
public agency in charge o f operating and managing sewer
networks and drainage. The urban water reform which i s
regarded as a best practice model in SSA, has
significantly improved the overall management o f the
sector o n the quality o f service delivery, efficiency o f
operations and cost recovery. As a result, the lease
contract was extended for 5 years in April 2006. L o n g
term financial viability o f the water sector was achieved
in December 2003 through increased efficiency and
effectiveness. Sector revenues became sufficient to fully
finance operations including debt service. This was
achieved through gradual annual tariff increases that
matched improvements in the quality o f service,
accompanied by public awareness campaigns.
A $100 m i l l i o n Bank investment in the WSP
leveraged an additional $150 m i l l i o n f r o m partners. The
L o n g T e r m Water Project (US$ 1 2 5 M for IDA and U S $
lOOM for other partners) became effective in June 2001.
This project i s addressing the continuing need for an
increase in water production capacity, finance muchneeded investments in sanitation, and support f k t h e r
institutional reforms.

A long t e r m support and a substantial partner support, an
optimized investment program with an appropriate m i x o f
public and private financing, a strong govt. commitment,
and performance incentives for the private operators,
were key elements o f success. Bank was instrumental in
bringing all players together. Strong procurement track
record in sector, and substantial contract amounts
attracted a large number o f international bidders. This
allowed for significant cost savings which were
channeled in additional capital investment. Future
lending i s expected to focus on rural water and sanitation
through the Water Millennium Action Plan developed
with the support o f the Bank.

Pillar 111: Improving Living Conditions of Vulnerable Groups

Protection o f vulnerable groups was included in a variety o f Bank projects. It was first
16.
integrated in projects in education, health and agriculture and in FY05 into the PRSC. While it i s
difficult to assess the Bank's contribution because the protection o f vulnerable groups i s not the
prime target o f these operations, the success o f the Nutrition Enhancement Program and the
Social Development Fund are two examples o f targeted interventions that exceeded their targets
and implemented high quality monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress and measure
impact. In terms o f impact on beneficiaries, these two projects have proved that communities are
fully capable o f managing their own development and significantly improving key development
outcomes. While the integration o f the Social Development Fund into the fledging local
governments will take time, the track record to date i s likely to lead to sustainable effort to
successfully target and address the needs o f the poorest. The Bank support therefore is rated
both relevant and highly satisfactory.

Bank Performance in Portfolio management

17.
Bank’s Portfolio. The number o f projects has remained relatively stable over the CAS
period at around 20 projects, representing an average commitment o f $760 million during the
period. Although the CAS originally called for a consolidation o f the portfolio and a move
towards more programmatic lending, such an effort was initiated gradually during FY03-06, and
is expected to be accelerated in the next CAS. This share o f programmatic lending has remained
stable.

The portfolio’s composition remained relatively stable over the 2003 CAS period. Based
o n commitments, infrastructure (Energy, Water, large infrastructure and Urban Development)
continued to dominate the portfolio by an average o f 57 percent, followed by human
development at 23 percent, and agriculture and rural development and private sector
development both at 9 percent. The percentage o f commitments in the Human Development
sector declined from roughly 28 percent in FY03 to 19 percent in FY06 mainly due to the closing
of 3 health projects. Health interventions are now financed through the PRSC program.
19.
The average age o f the portfolio over the period FY03-FY06 was 6.6 years. At the end o f
M a y 2006, this average declined to 2.9 years, though this masks the high average o f 4.9 and 4.6
years for infrastructure and health respectively. This was in marked contrast to 0.6 years for
rural development programs, reflecting the board approval o f three new projects expected to be
effective in FY07. There were two main reasons behind the relatively long implementation
period. First, the average number o f months for projects to become effective was 7.7 due to
considerable delays in meeting effectiveness conditions. Second, 10 projects were restructured
or extended at least once during the period FY03-06.
73

20.
One characteristic o f the portfolio was the large share o f Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) operations. In FY06, they represented about 45 percent o f the portfolio, up from 30
percent in FY03. The data include two new operations in the agricultural sector that were
approved in FY06 but not yet effective by end FY06. The multiple phase design o f APLs tends
to lock in resources in the same sectorhbsector for extended periods o f time; preventing a
strategic shift in portfolio allocations should emerging needs arise.
21.
Total disbursements more than doubled between FY03 and FY05, due largely to most o f
the projects being under fill maturity and a steady improvement in portfolio performance. The
PRSC also disbursed in FY05, significantly increasing average disbursement amounts. The
sectors with the largest average disbursements were infrastructure and energy, due to the large
size o f the operations and the value o f goods procured.
Figure 5: Disbursements by Sector

Disbursements by Sector FY03-06

22.
Improvements in projects ratings over time. Over the period FY03-06, the Bank was
able to significantly improve i t s portfolio management. There were no active projects rated as
unsatisfactory at the end o f M a y 2006, compared with 4 projects in FY04. Disbursement rates
increased at a steady pace (reaching 26.9 percent at end o f M a y 2006) and commitments at risk
declined to US$65 million from a high o f US$210 in FY03.
23.
These improvements were largely due to the active involvement o f the C M U which
created additional structures and internal controls in the past two years. The first was a quarterly
half-day Country Portfolio Performance Review at which key ministers and project coordinators
convene to resolve any outstanding issues. These could be project specific or cross cutting (such
as M&E, the role o f Project Implementation Units (PIUS), or audits, etc.). Meetings were well
attended and provided a forum for immediate decision and follow-up. The second emphasis has
been on improving Quality at Entry (QER). The C M U has been deliberate in providing guidance
to task teams at decision meetings and appraisal, often insisting on outside reviewers to provide
feedback on project. There has also been an increased emphasis on improving the results focus o f
projects and programs and obtaining expert advice from within and outside the region. Finally,

74

the Country Director has taken an active involvement in meeting with, and occasionally
participating in missions, commenting on Aide Memoires, and providing input on ICRs, etc.
24.
By M a y 2006, 14 projects were closed and had ICRs prepared. O f these projects, 11
were rated High or Substantial for Institutional Development, representing, approximately 80
percent o f portfolio commitments. There was considerable evidence o f strengthened capacity in
the water, telecommunication and road sector, while slower progress in health and education.
On the issue o f governance, IEG cites a range o f stagnating or declining measures related to
“government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule o f law” all o f which have been the source
o f Bank support provided through the ongoing PRSC program.
25.
The three projects evaluated as unsatisfactory by IEG (Endemic disease, Higher
Education, and Integrated Health) were also deemed to be unlikely to be sustainable with
negligible institutional development impact. The keys reasons for unlikely sustainability were:
(i)inadequate government ownership; (ii))
lack o f a results focus which contributed to poor
choice o f indicators that had incomplete baselines; (iii)proliferation o f institutions with
conflicting interests and financial shortcomings hindering implementation o f projects; and (iv)
too little attention to implementation support and supervision compared with project preparation.

A key issue in Senegal relates to the significant number o f PIUs designed to manage
26.
Bank projects. The Bank’s Africa Region strategy has encouraged the eliminatiodconsolidation
o f PIUs arguing they reduce the Government’s own capacity to manage projects and are not
likely to be sustainable. A closer look at PIUs in Senegal has revealed that their type, size,
function and effectiveness vary widely. W h i l e some are clearly candidates for elimination, some
like the Nutrition program PIU, which arguably i s the consummate multi-sector program, operate
as highly effective coordinating unit which has delivered outstanding results. A study o f Project
Implementation Units i s underway to determine whether the proliferation o f investment projects
in Senegal has undermined the capacity o f Government’s agencies to implement projects.
Evidence to date indicates that the nature o f PIUs in Senegal i s different from that o f other
countries in Africa, as the relatively small number o f people employed and the services i t
provides are specific and focused. A pragmatic and case by case approach should be taken in
Senegal.
Mixed instruments. The bulk o f projects delivered over the 2003 CAS period were
27.
investment projects. Budget support in the amount o f $30 million in the past two fiscal years
constituted only about 10 percent o f total disbursements, or 5 percent o f commitments. The
relatively small share o f budget support reflected unequal progress in financial management by
the Government and the Bank’s reluctance to provide large amounts o f direct budget support
before the implementation o f a h l l y transparent system. This strategic choice o f lending
instruments was also made by other donors, which have also limited their budget support. As
mentioned earlier (see para. 20), another feature o f the Bank’s portfolio has been the high share
o f the Adaptable Project Lending (APLs), which increased from 30 percent in FY03 to 45
percent in FY06. The reliance on APLs i s expected to decrease over time as this instrument will
be increasingly replaced by PRSCs, notably in social sectors, requiring annual monitoring o f
progress.

75

E.

Lessons Learned - Implication for the new CAS

25.
The lessons derived from the implementation o f the 2003 CAS need to be interpreted in
light o f the recent research on aid effectiveness (Le., the Paris Declaration) and the experience
from implementation o f several CASs in Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. The following
are the seven key lessons that need to be incorporated into the design o f the new CAS (FY07FY 10).
26.
Stronger ownership by the Government. The Bank’s success in Senegal will be
determined by the actions and reforms undertaken by the authorities. I t i s essential that the
Bank’s lending and non-lending program be closely aligned to priorities o f the Government as
reflected in the second PRSP. Over the past two years, the relationship with the Government has
improved significantly both at the policy and operational levels. Country dialogue is more
constant, fluid and less tense. While there have been a number o f issues where the Bank has
publicly disagreed with the position o f the Government, there i s less room for mis-interpretation.
27.
Greater emphasis on governance. The authorities recognize the importance o f
governance and have designed a fourth pillar devoted to governance and to the need to promote
further decentralization and participatory mechanisms in the second PRSP. It i s proposed that
the Bank give special attention to governance in i t s new CAS, not only through specific
operations, but also through “a governance lens” that will help filter and monitor progress over
time.

28.
Greater emphasis on rural development. The Bank should support the Government in
balancing the provision o f infrastructure and social services across regions and across groups
(women, children, and disabled) and in i t s effort to decentralize economic activities outside o f
the Dakar area and through the development o f regional poles (e.g., Casamance, Senegal River
area).
29.
Sharpen results orientation. The new CAS should identify clear measurable outcomes
that determine success and are monitorable annually. This orientation should be reflected at both
the CAS and project/program levels. Many projects do not have key performance indicators that
are appropriate or can be measured. IDA 14 requires baseline data to be available for key
performance indicators by the 1’‘ Status report. N o t all performance indicators need to rely on
expensive household surveys and simple monitorable indicators can be prepared that give annual
progress. Finally, as implementation issues continue to be at the heart o f the portfolio, increased
emphasis should be placed on supporting the Government in managing for results, not just
measuring it.
30.
Design and choices of lending instruments. Effectiveness o f the Bank’s support i s
partially determined by the use o f appropriate lending instruments. The gradual shift toward
budget support and community driven initiatives should help increased ownership at the different
levels o f the Governments but i t should be accompanied by improvements in financial
management and procurement procedures. From the review o f the recent operations, it i s also
recommended that project design be simplified because they tend to rely on overly complex
conditionalities that have resulted in long delays for effectiveness and contributed to slow

76

implementation (as evidenced by the high number o f projects that had to be restructured or
extended). The number o f effectiveness conditions should not only be reduced but actually be in
place by Board date.
3 1.
Donor Harmonization. Seeking synergies with development partners will help increase
the Bank’s leverage and simplify procedures for the Government. The significant improvement
in the relationship with the donor community i s already bearing h i t , compared with from the
tensions in the earlier part o f the CAS period. This is evidenced by the increased co-financing o f
Bank projects. Senegal i s one o f the pilot countries for the implementation o f the Paris
Declaration and a number o f initiatives to push the agenda forward have started bearing fruit.
The Bank i s generally perceived as an “honest broker.” Many donors are more willing to engage
in a sector when the Bank i s involved, this is especially true in transport. When Government
ownership exists, the Bank can play a pivotal role in mobilizing resources and providing support
in areas few others can. The use o f alternative financial instruments such as MIGA, I F C and
Bank’s guarantees should be pursued, especially for infrastructure projects given the limited IDA
allocation.

32.
Communications. The Bank has made major strides in implementing a communications
and outreach strategy that i s beginning to bear fruit. The CAS consultations with the
Government, civil society, the private sector and donors were well received and appreciated.
The most successful projects have been those with clear ownership by the authorities o f the
reforms and outcomes, exemplified by the water and nutrition sectors. In both cases, leadership
was provided at the highest political level. This level o f coordination should exist not only
during preparation but during execution and evaluation. This i s particularly true for sectors
where the issues are complex, such as infrastructure and decentralization.

Implementation o f the Past CAS

2.
In the previous CAS 2003-05, IFC strategy was defined as: (i)
supporting the power
sector through additional investments in independent power producers to increase power
generation capacity; (ii)financing private infrastructure in other sectors such as telecoms
expanding regionally; (iii)providing support to investment climate initiatives such as the
Presidential Investment Council; and (iv) expanding activity in the financial sector, including
capacity building, establishing non-bank financial institutions, expansion o f micro-finance and
SME-oriented banks and financial institutions and local currency loan guaranties for lending to
private schools.
3.
During FY 2003-05, in a WBG initiative to restructure and improve Senegal’s electricity
sector, IFC was instrumental in developing and designing a new power generation project. On
April 25, 2005, the “Electricity Sector Efficiency Enhancement Project” was approved by the
joint I D N I F C Board including an IDA credit o f US$15.7 million together with an I F C A Loan
o f €17 million and a Partial Risk Guarantee o f up to US$7.2 million for the Kounoune I.The
IFC loan was committed in November 2005.
4.
In July 2005, I F C initiated a new program o f technical assistance under the title Private
Enterprise Partnership for Africa. This donor funded program replaces the previous APDF with
84

a more focused approach. PEP Africa will design and implement technical assistance programs
both at micro (enterprise) and macro (sectors o f the economy and business climate) levels, to be
complemented with financing. One such program, SME Enterprise Development Initiative has
already started.
5.
I F C has endeavored to develop projects during the past CAS following its strategic
orientation. However, project development has been extremely slow in light o f the challenging
business climate in the country and limited staff resources in the office. Indeed, Senegal ranks
146th in the 2006 Doing Business Report. IFC has taken an active role in the Presidential
Investor Council to assist in improving the business climate.
C.

IFC Strategy During FY07-FY10

Development constraints: Senegal has achieved 5-6 percent real GDP growth in the
6.
past few years and i s aiming at higher rates according to the Accelerated Growth Strategy o f the
Government. However, growth i s mostly achieved in the construction and property sectors,
financed by remittances from Senegalese abroad. Moreover, growth slowed to around 3 percent
in 2006 due to o i l prices but also due to unfavorable domestic circumstances. Despite some
progress in adopting new measures and simplifjmg procedures by the Presidential Investor
Council, the business climate remains challenging and is an impediment to attracting foreign as
well as domestic investment.

7.
The banking sector remains the main source o f financing for the economy but i s mostly
focused on the larger enterprises. The microfinance institutions are not able to meet the needs o f
their clients as they develop to become micro-enterprises. As a result, the SMEs remain
underserved, particularly for financing their growth. Furthermore, even for the larger enterprises,
medium- and long-term financing for their development i s difficult to find as banks are restricted
in transforming their short-term funding to finance longer term loans.

8.
In the past year, the credit quality o f the banks’ portfolios has deteriorated as a number o f
larger companies face financial difficulty. This has further reduced the banks’ appetite for risk
and their willingness to finance SMEs.
9.
At the same time, during years o f structural adjustment few investments have been made
in infrastructure projects. As a result, the country i s in need o f major investments to develop
roads, energy, means o f transportation and basic urban and rural infrastructure. Dakar remains
congested and needs urban planning.
10.
The Accelerated Growth Strategy could address some o f theses issues. The Government
enjoys significant fiscal space as a result o f recent debt forgiveness and potentially significant
funding through donors. In this context, IFC intends to implement a strategy that will address
the needs o f the country and supports the objectives o f the Government.
11.
IFC Objectives. During FY2007-2010, IFC’s strategy for Senegal, both in terms o f
investments and technical assistance, i s focused on: (i)
improving the investment climate; (ii)
building up the capacity o f SMEs and micro enterprises and that o f institutions that can support
them; and (iii)proactive support to project development in the priority sectors (tourism,

85

agribusiness, telecom and hi-tech and manufacturing) set out in the Accelerated Growth Strategy
o f the Government.
12.
Power. In line with the Energy Sector Development Letter issued by the Government on
April 9, 2003, the WBG advocated for the development o f new generation projects through
public-private partnerships, whereby the private sector would own and operate the project, and
the public sector would provide the required support/mitigation through guarantees (as i t i s the
case in the GTI Dakar and Kounoune IIPPs). The transmission and distribution systems,
however, would remain under Senelec’s ownership and control, and be financed by Senelec with
the support o f the donor community.
After a year o f hiatus in the dialogue between the WBG, Government and Senelec, the
13.
appointment o f a new director at Senelec marks a new beginning in the chapter o f collaboration
in this sector. The WBG i s working on a new package for the sector including WB budgetary
support to be earmarked for Senelec and IFC financing for a new 100 M W IPP to be initiated
during 2007. I F C could provide advisory services for a potential Public Private Partnership
solution for Senelec in the medium term. It was agreed that Senelec will pursue establishing the
Kounoune I1project (a new 6 0 M W diesel power plant), on i t s own balance sheet.
Financial sector

14.
Development o f the bond market. Discussions are well advanced with one bank to
provide a 10 to 20 percent IFC partial guaranty on T C N issues which would allow the bank to
raise up to 7 year funds. This i s an intermediary step in liberalizing debt markets and initiating
investors to credit analysis. The idea i s to move toward a guaranty free issuance o f debt
instruments.

15.
IFC and KFW will be investing in two microfinance institutions to be established de
novo. In line with the FSAP recommendations for Senegal, the IFC’s objective would be to
introduce greater coverage o f the micro lending sector and encourage the local banks to take an
active role in microfinance. Because o f the regulatory environment (taxes and interest rate
ceilings), the banks could not downscale to microfinance on balance sheet, but would need to
establish de novo microfinance institutions (in which they could invest only up to 25 percent
directly) in order to benefit from the appropriate legislation. One institution will focus on the
rural sector (the operator has been selected and local partners are being considered) and another
will serve urban clients (selection o f operator i s to be completed in the second quarter o f 2007).
The housing finance sector in the region has attracted much attention o f late, with both
16.
private and public sector players seeking appropriate approaches to developing the sector. I F C
has been working closely with the World Bank in this regard with a view to introducing guaranty
and liquidity institutions to work on a regional basis within the West African Monetary and
Economic Union.

17.
Global Trade Finance Program. The IFC has been marketing this program in Senegal
with great success. Three banks have expressed interest in signing up for the program and due
diligence missions are in progress.

86

18.
IFC’s commitment to the development of the West African capital markets. In
December 2006, I F C became the first non-resident international financial institution to issue a 22
billion C F A franc denominated bond in the WAEMU countries. Though this exercise, I F C
introduced international standards and market practices, as in all 33 countries i t has previously
issued, and provided institutional investors with the opportunity to invest in A a d A A A rated
securities. To distribute the issue, IFC worked with regional SociCtCs de Gestion et
IntermCdiation and involved 6 regional financial institutions as partner banks, three o f which
were from Senegal. As a result o f a comprehensive road show, the IFC issue was distributed in
all o f the 8 countries o f WAEMU and i t s proceeds were invested in 4 projects in the region. The
largest portion o f the proceeds went to finance SOCOCIM in Senegal to help i t improve
production processes to meet Senegalese and international environmental standards, build a
power plant for i t s internal use and an expansion to meet growing demand for cement. As a
result o f the success o f this issue, Conseil RCgional has given I F C authorization to bring to the
bond market one o f i t s clients with only a partial guaranty as a test case in the process o f removal
o f the 100% guaranty requirement for issuers, and the further liberalization o f the market. IFC i s
working on developing one such issue during 2007.
SME Access to Finance. In conjunction with IDA, I F C i s implementing an IDA-IFC
19.
Access to Finance Project, which aims at improving access to finance for SMEs in Senegal. The
project design i s similar to the other PCGs in Sub-Saharan Africa, with an IDA-IFC partial
guarantee o f up to 50 percent o f a new SME portfolio coupled with technical assistance for the 2
selected banks. The 2 banks are being appraised for the investment product. Inparallel, TA will
be provided to SMEs. I D M I F C would be considering an investment o f up to US$10 million in
this project coupled with $1 million o f IDA funds for T A for the banks, resulting in a total SME
portfolio o f US$20 million..
Infrastructure

20.
The Dakar-Diamnadio toll road. In cooperation with the World Bank, MIX has
developed a major toll road project connecting Dakar to Diamniadio. The objective i s to
alleviate traffic congestion in Dakar, relocate and rehabilitate a community that suffers very poor
living conditions in the outskirts o f the city and create a link to a platform o f commercial and
industrial activity in Diamniadio to be developed by M C C and to a new airport. The project cost
i s currently estimated at US$250 million o f which US$80 million is expected to come from the
private sector. The World Bank through i t s IDA window will be contributing US$50 million
with the remainder coming from other bilateral/multilateral and budgetary sources. Currently,
the Government has selected a strategic advisor to help in refining the parameters o f the project.
IFC’s active involvement will be sought probably in the second h a l f o f 2007.
The commerciaVindustria1Diamnadio platform partially financed by MCC. As part
21.
o f the Government’s infrastructure and public works development efforts and in the context o f
the accelerated Growth Strategy, the commercialhndustrial platform has been identified and
submitted to the M C A for funding. Discussions with M C C are far along and in July 2005
US$6.5 million were committed for technical and feasibility studies. In the event o f favorable
findings, the M C A could be providing financing o f US$300-400 million to rehabilitate land,
provide basic infrastructure, access roads and the like. Currently, the Government expects

87

private sector investment o f an equal amount on the platform. I F C has had discussions with the
officials, and has expressed support once a clearer definition o f projects i s available.

22.
Telecommunications. In the context o f the third global telephony license to be awarded
by the telecom regulator, IFC has expressed i t s willingness to provide financial and technical
assistance to the potential winning bidder.
Technical Assistance

23.
Agribusiness. IFC will provide technical assistance to a Senegalese and Spanish joint
horticultural venture to strengthen procedures and management o f the company. The project will
consist in: (i)
implementing an integrated Management Information system; (ii)
organizing study
tours for the New Manager; and (iii)
Certification o f their produce. A tomato growing/processing
project will receive TA for (i)
better structuring the business plan to be financed by IFC, and (ii)
an out-grower scheme to better train and organize i t s future suppliers.
24.
School facility. As tried in Ghana, the facility combines an I F C investment with
technical assistance to address challenges faced by private schools. IFC and AFD are currently
undertaking an assessment to understand the size and characteristics o f the private schools sector
in Senegal. This will determine the likely level o f demand for financing to allow I F C and the
partner bank to design a risk sharing facility on a new portfolio o f loans to private schools and
assess the technical assistance needs o f the schools.
Tourism. PEP Africa proposes the development o f an accommodation e-marketplace
25.
program to be implemented in partnership with the Tourism Association o f Senegal. Besides
developing and promoting a tourism e-marketplace (WorldHotel-Link.com) the program also
aims at capacity building in selected tourism associations that will run the site, develop and offer
training and capacity building to the hosted accommodation providers.

26.
ICT. PEP Africa proposes to develop a TA program for the enterprises in the sector to
provide (i)training for their staff, (ii)strategic and marketing advice benefiting from lessons
leant in other off-shoring centers where I F C has been involved, and (iii)
basic SME tool kits to
these companies to make them more bankable. I F C i s in discussions with other donors including
AFD to promote this promising sector that could be a promising generator o f employment. In
conjunction with this TA program, IFC could provide support to local banks to facilitate access
to finance for the SMEs in this sector.

Annex 4: MIGA’s Program (Cont’d)
MIGA has no active TA program in Senegal. However, a number o f recent TA activities
have been concluded, including:

MSP
Senegal was a participant in the MIGA-Swiss-Partnership Program (MSP) - an investment
facilitation program in four African countries, co-funded by the Swiss government. Under the
initiative, successfully concluded in the summer o f 20006, MIGA assisted the Senegalese
National Investment Promotion Agency (APIX) in i t s efforts to attract FDI into apparel, textiles
and call centers. Outreach activities were organized to target investors in these sectors and
resulted in a number o f investments.
Snapshot Africa

MIGA released a new regional report - Snapshoot Africa - in early 2006. The report displays
the results o f a study conducted by MIGA, comparing the operating costs and conditions for
investors in six industries in nine-sub-Saharan African countries: Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. The study-designed to help
investment promotion intermediaries in developing countries to attract foreign direct investmenti s the fifth in a series o f sector analyses under MIGAS’s Global Enterprising Benchmarking
Program.
The study identifies each country’s comparative advantage by capturing a snapshot o f an
industry in one location at a point in time from the perspective o f an investor. In total, nearly
300 investors, both foreign and local, were surveyed for the study. Snapshot Africa examines the
attractiveness o f six sectors from the vantage point o f investors - textile, apparel, food and
beverage processing, horticulture, tourism and call centers - which are incidentally sectors
attracting the highest level o f mobile FDI in sub-Saharan Africa. The study examines numerous
thriving investments, underscoring the untapped potential o f these sectors. For prospective
investors, Snapshot Africa provides hard-to-find comparable information on investor costs and
conditions in the above-mentioned sectors, and can assist them to develop their site selection
options.

MIGA I P A Performance Review
Senegal participated in MIGAS’s IPA Performance Review 2006. The 2006 Review i s an
ambitious global survey which has comprehensively measured P A performance in terms o f their
ability to provide investor information. Access to good-quality investment-related information is
critical to investors during the site selection process, and the results o f this study are now being
used to advise each participating agency o f i t s performance relative to that o f other P A Sand to
industry best-practice standards.
The Review consisted to two components: first, each IPA’s web site was reviewed from the
perspective o f private investor’s information requirements in screening locations as potential
90

investment sites. The assessments covered web site architecture and design, the quality and
relevance of information and content available on the site, and the use o f the site as marketing
tool. Second, the study undertook a survey o f each site, and the use o f the site as a marketing
tool. Second, the study undertook a survey o f each IPA’s ability to handle specific investor
enquiries. The study used a “Mystery shopper” approach, in which anonymous investor
enquiries were submitted to each P A , and the P A was assessed on the basis o f the quality o f i t s
responses.

91

Annex 5: Joint Fund-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
This analysis assesses the sustainability of Senegal’s external public debt and total public
debt. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was conducted jointly by the staffs of the IMF
and the World Bank, using the joint Bank-Fund framework for debt sustainability analysis
for low-income countries (LIC). The data in this DSA were updated by Fund staff and
Senegalese authorities during the October 2006 Article I V consultation mission.

1.
The risk of debt distress in Senegal i s low during the period 2006-26, given the
low current level of debt, and assuming the fiscal deficit remains below 4 percent of
GDP on the average, real interest rates remain below real GDP growth rate and the
inflow of concessional funds i s sustained at historical levels.38Under the baseline scenario,
which assumes fiscal deficit and inflow o f concessional funds aligned with historical trends,
the net present value (NPV) o f total (domestic and external) public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) debt-to-GDP ratio will remain below i t s policy-dependent threshold during the whole
projection period. The total PPG debt service-to-revenues ratio (including short-term debt
service) will nevertheless double to 30 percent in five years if the average maturity o f new
debt remains at the current one year. Debt burden indicators worsen significantly if
borrowing terms deteriorate or if the fiscal deficit remains high.
Background

2. Senegal’s debt sustainability indicators improved substantially after the enhanced
HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Senegal reached i t s
HIPC floating completion point in April 2004, when i t received debt r e l i e f o f about US$4SS
million in NPV terms (about US$S50 million in nominal terms).39 Debt r e l i e f under the HIPC
has been granted by Kuwait and all Paris Club creditors except Sweden. China has
committed to cancel all Senegal’s debt. In 2005, Senegal qualified for further debt
cancellation under the MDRI when the IMF, the International Development Association
(IDA), and the African Development Fund (AfDF) cancelled their claims on Senegal
amounting to about US$1.4 billion in nominal terms (19 percent o f 2006 GDP in NPV
terms).40 As a result o f these two initiatives, the NPV o f external PPG debt outstanding is
estimated to have amounted to 13 percent o f GDP at end-2006. Public domestic debt is
estimated at about 3 percent o f GDP, o f which two-thirds i s long-tern.
3.
The exposure of the private sector also appears limited. The International
Investment Position compiled by the B C E A O for end-2004 indicates that the stock o f private
external debt (net o f private external assets) i s only 9 percent o f GDP. The net private
external debt includes trade credit (2 percent o f GDP), currency and deposits owed by
38

The risk of debt distress i s considered low if all debt indicators are well below relevant country-specific debtburden thresholds and stress testing does not result in indicators significantly breaching thresholds.
39 See Senegal: Enhanced Initiative for HIPC-Completion Point Document (Country Report 04/130)
40
MDRI debt r e l i e f from the IMF became effective in January 5,2006, providing stock relief on debt disbursed
before end-2004 and still outstanding at end-2005. IDA and the AfDF started providing debt r e l i e f in July 2006.
The eligible debt covers IDA credits disbursed before end-2003 and AfDF credits disbursed before end-2004
that are still outstanding at the time o f qualification.

GDP).
Methodology and Baseline scenario

4.
Following the guidelines of the LIC DSA framework, staffs have analyzed the
evolution of the total public debt stock and debt service indicators for Senegal subject to
a baseline scenario and a series of stress tests.41 The stress tests are designed to assess a
country’s probability o f facing debt distress in the future.42 The analysis is guided by
indicative, country-specific external PPG debt-burdenthresholds, which take into account the
empirical finding that the external debt levels that a low-income country can sustain increase
with the quality o f i t s policies and institutions. The quality o f policies and institutions i s
measured by the World Bank’s 2005 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
according to which Senegal ranks as a “strong performer.” The indicative external debtburden thresholds for countries in this category are: (i)
an NPV o f external PPG debt-to-GDP
ratio o f 50 percent; (ii)
an NPV o f external PPG debt-to-exports ratio o f 200 percent; (iii)
an
NPV o f external PPG debt-to-revenue ratio o f 300 percent; (iv) an external PPG debt serviceto-exports ratio o f 25 percent; and (v) an external medium and long-term PPG debt serviceto-revenue ratio o f 35 percent.

5.

Broadly in line with the PRSP 11, the baseline scenario assumes that:

Economic performance will follow the trends observed during 2000-5 (Box 1 and
Table 3). Economic growth will recover from around 3.3 percent in 2006 and range
between 4.9 and 5.6 percent during 2007-26-3.8 percentage points higher than the
average real interest rate on public debt over the period. The projected recovery in
2007-8 will be induced by the decline in international o i l prices and the resolution o f
the financial crisis in Senegal’s largest company (Industries Chimiques du Se‘nkgal Beyond 2008, the reforms to improve the business environment will boost
private investment and sustain economic growth close to the trend level o f 5.1 percent
per year observed in 2000-05.44
The overall fiscal deficit (including transfers) will remain below 4 percent o f GDP
over 2007-26 on the average.
41
See “Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries-Further
Considerations,” M a r c h 28, 2005 (ivww.irnf.org). The new framework introduces some methodological changes
in the calculation o f the NPV o f debt compared to the H I P C methodology by using: (a) a fixed 5 percent
discount rate instead o f currency specific discount rates (under HIPC); (b) WE0 exchange rate projections
instead o f fixed exchange rates as o f the end o f the base year; and (c) annual exports instead o f a three-year
average o f exports as the denominator in the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio.
42 The standard stress tests conducted for Senegal for external D S A are listed in Table 2 and for fiscal D S A in
Table 4. The most-extreme stress tests (worst-case scenarios) depicted in Figures 1 and 2 and detailed in B o x 2
are those with the worst indicator in 20 16.
43 The price o f o i l is assumed t o decline t o U S $ 5 9 per barrel, at end-2006 f r o m U S $ 68 in mid-2006, and rise t o
U S $ 64 at end-2008. I t i s projected to decline again to US$59 at end-201 1 and stabilize at that level for the rest
o f the projection period.

,

The external current account deficit will decline during 2007-26 as export growth
exceeds that o f imports (Box 1 and Table 1). Growth in the exports o f goods will
outpace the growth in GDP in 2007-2026 as ICs, which accounts for about 10 percent
o f total exports, will gradually resume i t s activities during 2007-08, and structural
reforms expand the export base. Imports as a percentage o f GDP will fall in 2007-08
as o i l prices decline and the local refinery resumes i t s operations. Remittances will
grow slightly faster than GDP during the entire projection period, in line with recent
trends.
External borrowing on concessional terms will remain constant at trend level o f about
3.5 percent o f GDP throughout the projection period, with an average grant element
o f 45.3 percent (1.6 percent o f GDP). The authorities intend to borrow abroad only on
concessional terms. Financing needs o f the public sector beyond that level will be
covered almost entirely by short-term domestic borrowing o n non-concessional terms,
which i s consistent with the debt management policy implemented in recent years.

External Sustainability Analysis

6. Under the baseline scenario, Senegal’s external PPG debt-burden indicators
remain below the thresholds throughout the projection period. The NPV o f external PPG
debt-to-GDP ratio will rise slightly from 13 percent in 2006 to 15 percent by 2026 under this
scenario, below the policy-dependent threshold o f 50 percent for a strong performer such as
Senegal. Similarly, the NPV o f external PPG debt-to-exports ratio and the external PPG debt
service-to-exports ratio are projected to remain under 56 and 6 percent, respectively, during
the whole projection period, below their respective policy-dependent thresholds (Figure 1
and Table 2).
94

7.
External debt sustainability indicators remain below the thresholds in case o f all
standard temporary shocks, including the most extreme.45The most extreme stress test
for Senegal consists o f a combined two-year decline in GDP growth, export growth, capital
inflows, and a reduction in GDP in US dollars (Box 2).46 External PPG debt and debt service
will rise sharply as a result o f such a shock, but will remain below the thresholds during the
projection period (Figure 1, Table 2).

The debt indicators are sensitive to borrowing terms. If all new external borrowing
(3.5 percent o f GDP annually on average) i s concessional with an average grant element o f
45.3 percent, the NPV o f external PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will rise by only 2 percentage
points in the projection period. However, i t will grow by 21 percentage points and reach 34
percent in 2026 if all new external borrowing is non-concessional (Figure 1 and Table 2). In
this case, the debt indicators remain below the threshold during the projection period but
continue to grow and eventually breach the thresholds after the end o f the projection period.
If financing under the worst-case shock i s non-concessional, the NPV o f external PPG debtto-GDP ratio in 2008 will be 10 percentage points higher than if i t i s concessional (Figure 1).
These results underline the need for the government to adhere strictly to the policy o f
borrowing externally only on concessional terms.
Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

9.
Under the baseline scenario, the public debt indicators mirror the external debt
indicators. The NPV o f total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio and the NPV o f total PPG debt-toexports ratio will remain l o w during the entire projection period, even though the domestic
portion o f the total public debt i s non-concessional. The medium and long-term debt serviceto-revenues ratio will similarly remain l o w under the baseline scenario (Box 1, Figure 2,
Tables 3 and 4).

45 The effect o f fiscal slippages o n total PPG debt i s analyzed in the next section.
The tests assume that balance-of-payments gaps are financed by public sector borrowing. External PPG debt
indicators remain unchanged if the balance-of-payments gaps are financed by private sector borrowing.
46 The magnitude o f the shocks in the worst-case scenarios i s substantially more severe than the effect o f
delaying the resumption o f ICs for one year, in which case G D P growth rate w o u l d be around 1.5 percentage
point below the baseline scenario in 2007.

95

10.
The government may face rollover difficulties over the next 5 to 10 years owing
to the growing share of short-term domestic debt (Figure 3). I f the current policy o f
issuing short-term securities to close the financing gap continues in the medium-term, the
total PPG debt service-to-revenue ratio (including short-term debt service) will double to 30
percent by 2011 before stabilizing at a high level, around 42 percent, over the rest o f the
period.47 These projections underline the need for Senegal to extend the maturities o f public
debt securities and to develop a liquid primary and secondary market for government debt.

11.
Fiscal debt sustainability hinges on the reduction of the fiscal deficit to below 4
percent o f GDP on the average. If the fiscal deficit remains at i t s 2006 level o f 5.7 percent
o f GDP (equivalent to a primary deficit o f 5.0 percent o f GDP) during the entire projection
period, the NPV o f total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 50 percent in 2021. The financing
needs caused by the accumulated deficits could crowd out the private sector. The NPV o f
total debt-to-revenue ratio and debt service-to-revenue ratio (including short-term debt
service) will follow similar trajectories, reaching 268 and 197 percent by 2026, respectively.
This prospect highlights once again the need for the authorities to pursue a prudent fiscal
policy over the medium-term (Figure 2 and Tables 3 and 4).
12.
Temporary adverse shocks will require additional fiscal adjustment to reduce
domestic borrowing needs and stabilize public debt. The most extreme shock for fiscal
DSA, which involves GDP growth rate falling to 2.3 percent a year in 2007 and 2008
(equivalent to one standard deviation below i t s historical average), would raise the NPV o f
total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio to 50 percent by the end o f the projection period. The NPV o f
total PPG debt-to-revenues ratio would follow a similar trajectory and reach 200 percent in
2022. The realization o f a sizeable contingent liability equivalent to 10 percent o f GDP in
2007 i s less severe than the worst-case scenario. To insure that debt indicators remain within
reasonable limits in case o f a shock, the fiscal deficit should be reduced below the level
assumed under the baseline scenario (Box 2, Figure 2 and Table 4).
Conclusion

13.
The risk o f debt distress remains low. Debt indicators rise steeply during the
projection period only if the overall fiscal deficit remains at its 2006 level o f 5.7 percent o f
GDP, or the average maturity o f new domestic debt remains at one year or less. Beyond
2026, the debt distress may arise only i f GDP does not grow as projected, or all borrowing is
on non-concessional terms. In these cases, additional fiscal adjustment will be needed to
ensure that the risk o f debt distress stays low. This D S A highlights the need for Senegal to
continue to adopt strict fiscal discipline, a prudent strategy regarding borrowing on nonconcessional terms, and appropriate debt management policies.

Annex 6: CAS Consultations and Outreach

27.
The CAS consultation process was designed with the objective o f listening and
gaining a better understanding o f the concerns and motivations o f stakeholders as well as
to get feedback on the effectiveness o f Bank Group assistance. This annex describes the
main elements o f the process adopted by the Bank’s country team to reach out to the
Government, the private sector, civil society and the donors operating in Senegal.
Step 1: January-March 2006

-- the path to the CAS Concept note

28.
The consultation process started within the WBG with the organization o f a
brainstorming session at the end January 2006. This session benefited from a large
representation from staffs in Washington and in the field as well as from the WBG at
large (WBI, MIGA, and IFC). I t resulted in a preliminary agreement on the key
challenges faced by the WBG in i t s assistance to Senegal and the identification o f the
CAS core team, with representatives from the Bank’s Africa Region and technical units,
IFC, MIGA, and WBI. This agreement was transferred to the CAS outline that was
subsequently shared with the CAS core team, leading to the finalization o f the concept
note that was presented and endorsed by the Country Team on March 2 1, 2006.
29.
In parallel to the consultation process within the WBG, preliminary consultations
with Government officials started in February 2006, notably with the unit in charge o f
designing and monitoring the implementation o f the PRSP over time. K e y challenges
perceived by the Bank were shared by a group o f stakeholders (ranging from Government
officials, NGOs representatives, donors, and researchers) in a workshop o n poverty
organized jointly by the Government and the Bank in Dakar on February 27, 2006.
Dialogue with other donors began within the context o f the donors’ working group
organized around the PRSP, co-chaired by the Bank and UNDP. The primary purpose o f
the above consultations was to listen and increase common understanding o f country
conditions and concerns, and the role and interests o f diverse stakeholders. These
consultations helped define the basic structure o f the CAS.
Step 2: April-May 2006: From the Concept Note to the ROC Document

30.
The consultation process was intensified within the WBG with the goal to prepare
the outcome-based matrix presented in Annex 1. The process was sequential. The first
stage was to share the proposed results-based methodology with the entire CAS team
through a series o f video-conferences with the Dakar office, led by Ronnie Hammad
(AFTQK) and moderated by Susan Otis (HRSCE). The CAS TTL and a selected few
team members also participated in the CAS Academy training program organized by
OPCS. The second stage consisted o f four sessions devoted to drafting the outcomebased matrix around the Governance filter and the three pillars on which the proposed
CAS is built. The third and final stage helped finalize the draft matrix through an
iterative process involving the TTL and the core members o f the CAS team.
3 1.
Informal consultations continued in Dakar. A series o f meetings was organized
by the Dakar office to exchange information and opinions between the CAS team and
104

representatives from: (i)
the media; (ii)
civil society; and (iii)
the private sector. Followup meetings were organized with Government representatives, including the Minister o f
Economy and Finance, to share the World Bank’s vision and agree on a tentative
timetable for in-country consultations. On June 20, a one-day workshop was organized
in Dakar during which the CAS team shared i t s views and discussed the broad lines o f the
proposed CAS for the period FY07-10. This workshop included representatives from the
four working groups supporting the implementation o f the second-generation PRSP in
Senegal, including: (i)
central Government; (ii)
local Governments; (iii)
civil society and
the private sector; and (iv) donors.
Step 3: July 2006-March 2007

32.
A more formal consultation process was .iunchel in the country, followed
clearance from the R O C meeting. I t was principally managed by the Country Office
(under the responsibility o f the Information Coordinator) in close collaboration with the
TTL, and with the support o f HRSCE. I t i s worth under scoring that the consultations
were fully integrated in the participatory process surrounding the finalization o f the PRSP
by the Government. N o t only were key stakeholders identical in both processes, but the
Bank was also co-chairing the group o f donors involved in the PRSP. This opportunity
allows us to align perfectly the CAS with the PRSP priorities.
33.
The CAS consultations also benefited from the G A C consultations (December
2006-January 2007), which were an additional opportunity to go more deeply in some
complex issues on governance and corruption. Participants in all sessions welcome the
consultation as an opportunity to raise and to discuss on national issues, including (i)
the
role o f civil society; (ii)greater transparency and efficiency in the use o f public
economic growth and transparency; (iv) investment climate; (v) human
resources; (iii)
developmenthhared growth; (vi) public sector accountability; (vii) judicial system; and
(viii) mechanisms for private sector governance
34.
Last but not least, the consultation process included the presentation o f the second
PRSP to the Bank’s Board o f Director on January 30, 2007, which has allowed the
country team to account for the Directors’ concerns and comments.

Annex 7: CAS Harmonization and Coordination with Other Donors
A.

Background

35.
Aligning the WBG support with the PRSP objectives as well as harmonizing it
with the assistance provided by other partners i s at the hearth o f the CAS agenda over the
period FY07-FY10. This goal i s shared by the Senegalese authorities, who made clear
their willingness to increase aid effectiveness in accordance with their commitment to the
Paris Declaration. Inparticular, the decision to establish an action plan on harmonization,
alignment and aid effectiveness i s explicitly mentioned in the PRSP-11. The MEF has set
up an internal working group, chaired by the CSPLP, and tasked with the preparation o f
this action plan.
B.

Recent Developments

36.
Remarkable progress has been achieved by the government and its
development partners in recent years. Donors strongly improved their coordination in
the education sector, with better alignment o f project cycles and the preparation o f a
procedure manual. The complexity o f the sector and bottlenecks in implementation
capacity within the Government led to the decision that different types o f aid instruments
were s t i l l needed at this point in time. Some partners (France, Netherlands, EU and
Canada) are working on the implementation o f a sector budget support, and some decided
to jointly finance capacity building activities (World Bank and France). This increased
harmonization builds on Government achievements, particularly a sectoral MTEF, a
Government led policy framework, a unit within the Ministry o f Education designated as
a focal point for donor-Government relations, and a common matrix o f objectives.
37.
Similarly, donors active in public financial management reform jointly support a
Government led program. The World Bank set up a trust fund to harmonize the financing
o f this program. A M O U will soon formalize the strong existing coordination between
the donors providing general budget support, including the Bank through i t s PRSC series.
In decentralization and local development, the government designed with support from
the World Bank a national program (Programme National de Developpement Local PNDL) which i s designed to serve as a conduit though which all local development
activities will be channeled. The recently approved IDA Participatory Development
Project will support the PNDL, and all donors agree to participate in the PNDL as soon as
the existing projects are closing, thus progressively operationalizing a Sector-Wide
approach. In the water sector, all donors have agreed to use the integrated project
coordination unit set up within the Ministry o f Water Resources. In most sectors, donors
coordinate through sector working groups and have agreed to designate a lead donor for
discussion with the Government.
These achievements are encouraging but are still too limited. Donor38.
Government relations need to be substantially improved, with actions to be taken both by
the donors and by the Government.

106

39.
A survey o f the most important partners undertaken by the World Bank in the first
quarter o f 2006 confirms that many donors are very active in Senegal, with a total
portfolio estimated at around US$2.3 billions at the end o f 2005, including almost 500
projects. The largest donors are by decreasing order the World Bank, the African
Development Bank, the European Union, and USAID (Table 1).

This survey also points to a series of concerns. The number o f active projects i s
very high (474 by end 2005, for an average amount o f only 5 millions dollars), with a
small proportion o f co-financed projects (1 on 4). Some sectors have a strong donor
concentration (education, health, rural development, governance and decentralization,
private sector development), leading to increased coordination issues. Project
management activities (procurement, monitoring, financial reporting, auditing, etc.)
107

impose a strong burden on the limited capacities o f the Senegalese administration,
especially as harmonization efforts are s t i l l limited. Budget support accounts for only
10% o f all aid flows to Senegal. Aid alignment on the PRSP priorities i s unsatisfactory,
the third pillar receiving very little attention from donors. Within the four pillars, some
sectors receive a very small share o f financing, like energy with only 2 percent o f total
aid resources.
41.
The World Bank survey also revealed a strong gap between donors’
disbursements and aid flows reported in the TOFE. MEF’s data o n ongoing projects and
programs as well as on forecasted and effective disbursements is partial and not updated.
In many cases, donors don’t provide to the MEF the required data, or provide it too late.
The responsibilities within the MEF for aid program monitoring are unclear and spread
on a number o f units. Last, many donors, including important ones, don’t take part to the
joint discussions and work to increase aid effectiveness.

42.
The Monitoring survey o f the Paris Declaration points to very similar
conclusions. There are strong discrepancies between aid levels disbursed by donors and
the amounts they report to the government, as well as between previsions and effective
disbursements. In addition, the survey shows that donors maintain a large number o f
parallel PIUs (60) and coordinate a very small fraction o f their missions (only 22% o f the
307 annual missions are joint), and that major donors still have a long way to go to
undertake jointly their analytical work.
108

Besides, many bottlenecks within the Senegalese administration are slowing
the move towards program and budget support. A joint diagnostic o f these structural
obstacles should be quickly undertaken. The following elements, some o f which appear
in the PRSP-11, are likely to come out from such a study. Administrative capacities are
s t i l l limited, and many donors rely on parallel or independent project units to implement
their projects, which further weaken ministries’ capacities. The Government has not yet
formulated a national capacity building strategy, which would be reflected in the sectoral
policies, and on which donors would align and harmonize their support. Severe
limitations in the recruiting and remuneration policies o f the Senegalese Government
prevent the administration to deliver core basic services, especially outside o f Dakar.
43.

C.

Recommendations

44.
The harmonization action plan announced in the PRSP-I1 should aim at
overcoming these difficulties. Consistent with the mutual accountability promoted by
the Paris Declaration, the logic should not be to list a set o f conditions (on the charge o f
the Government or o f the partners), but to start a virtuous circle where donors and the
Government would jointly build the foundations for a more efficient aid. M a n y
countries, including in Africa, already have such action plans (Ghana, Ethiopia), or have
started a process to establish one (Mali, Rwanda, Tanzania--where the aid effectiveness
agenda encompasses a very rich and diverse set o f activities)

45.
Such an action plan could be based on the list of indicators o f the Paris
Declaration, and establish clear methodologies, stages and targets. It should form a
coherent set o f actions, each part building on the achievements in the other parts, and
with responsibilities shared between the Government and donors. I t s main axes could be:

0
0

0

0

Improving the quality o f Government-partners dialogue.
Improving aid management and monitoring by the Government (both MEF
and sector ministries).
Improving alignment o f aid on PRSP priorities.
Harmonizing capacity building activities around a strategy defined by the
Government.
Reducing aid dispersion.
Pursuing public financial management reform, and more broadly improving
governance.
Harmonizing donor procedures, increasing program and budget support.

46.
The drafting o f this action plan should build on the monitoring exercise o f
the Paris Declaration. The numerical targets in the action plan would be determined o n
the basis o f the 2005 baseline as it results from the Paris Declaration monitoring
questionnaire. The government could work to include in this exercise some important
donors who did not take part in the Paris Declaration monitoring survey or reply to the
World Bank questionnaire. Partners should make available the necessary resources for
the preparation and implementation o f this plan. Taking example o f achievements or
ongoing efforts in countries like Rwanda, Ghana or Mali, the Ministry o f Finance should

109

designate a focal point to lead the work, with active support from donors, and a dedicated
government-donor aid effectiveness working group should be established.

47.
The World Bank should take an active role in facilitating, and in some cases
leading, the joint effort to set up new program approaches for increased harmonization.
In sectors like agriculture development, transport or environment, or in the support o f the
Senegal River basin, donors and the government are actively laying the bricks for the
implementation o f sector-wide approaches, and in some cases have already agreed on
joint supervision and joint monitoring requirements. The Bank should be flexible and
adopt a proactive approach to project restructuring to support any new sector-wide
approach and reduce the administrative burden on the Senegalese administration.
Similarly, the Bank should strive to undertake in a joint manner all new Analytical and
Advisory Activities.
