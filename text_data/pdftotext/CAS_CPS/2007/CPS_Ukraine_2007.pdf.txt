EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. Ukraine i s a lower middle income country, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per
capita o f US$1940 in 2006. It i s the second largest country o f the former Soviet Union
with a population o f 46 million.

ii. Since 2000, Ukraine has enjoyed a strong economic recovery, with growth at around
7.5 percent per year o n average. Structural change has started but remains incomplete.
Ukraine continues t o lag behind the European Union (EU) accession in terms o f
economic reform. An important benchmark may be reached soon with the W o r l d Trade
Organization (WTO) accession.

iii.Rapid economic growth has facilitated a sharp decline in poverty in recent years.
Poverty has fallen sharply from 31 percent in 2001 to 8 percent in 2005. Ukraine has
enjoyed one o f the fastest rates o f poverty reduction in the Europe and Central Asia
Region (ECA) since the onset o f economic recovery in 2000. However, in spite o f this
achievement, the public’s satisfaction with their material well-being remains low.
iv. Ukraine’s macroeconomic framework o n the whole remains adequate, but the
authorities will need to be vigilant in the face o f potential external shocks or political
spending pressures. Under the Bank’s base-case medium-term macroeconomic forecast,
growth is maintained at around 5-6 percent per annum, with moderate inflation and
external as well as fiscal imbalances. External shocks would require policy adjustment to
safeguard Ukraine’s improvements in external creditworthiness.
v. Despite frequent government changes and significant political volatility, the basic
vision o f economic development for the country i s broadly shared between all main
political forces. The development vision includes a commitment to closer integration
with Europe and with the world economy at large.
vi. Ukraine i s receiving increased attention from international partners, in particular from
Europe. The EU has started negotiating a deep Free Trade Agreement with Ukraine, and
collectively the European institutions are now by far the largest provider o f financial
assistance.

vii.This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) builds on an analysis o f Ukraine’s key
development challenges. T o sustain growth into the future, specifically, Ukraine will
need to address three key challenges: (i)the improvement in competitiveness, (ii)
the
reform o f public finance and the public sector to improve service delivery and make
growth socially inclusive, and (iii)
tackling weaknesses in governance.
viii.
In response to these challenges, the CPS proposes a two-pillar framework o f
support. The first pillar will aim to improve Ukraine’s competitiveness through
investments in public sector infrastructure (in particular transport and energy efficiency),
advisory services and advocacy work to improve the business climate, technical

assistance and access to credit lines to strengthen the financial sector, and global
knowledge sharing to promote innovation and technology adoption, as well as to ensure
that Ukraine benefits from the framework for international carbon trading and makes a
contribution to emission reductions. The second pillar will seek to improve public
services by targeting greater efficiency in spending, and using improvements in public
sector financial management as an entry point into public sector reforms more generally.
i x . Governance and Anti-Corruption efforts will cut across both pillars o f the CPS. A
key problem for Ukraine i s the lack o f trust in public sector institutions, and the resulting
l o w expectations trap: the public expects little from the state, but is in turn not willing to
make much o f an effort to advocate for improvements either. The Bank’s approach will
concentrate on building demand for better governance, whilst continuing to seek
opportunities to strengthen public sector institutions where sufficient client ownership
and policy consensus exists.
x. The International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) activities will be a key element o f the
Bank Group’s strategy. The I F C will support the achievement o f target outcomes in the
first pillar through investments to support modernization o f the private sector, and
through selected investments in municipal and public infrastructure. The I F C will also
look for opportunities to help mobilize private funding for the modernization o f public
services. The IFC’s expanded advisory services will be a k e y component o f the Bank
Group’s non-lending interventions.

xi. Three principles underlie the operational approach in this CPS: (i)selectivity, (ii)
flexibility and (iii)
partnerships. These principles are directly derived from the lessons o f
experience in the previous CAS. The Bank will adopt a programmatic approach,
choosing a selected number o f areas for support, with the range o f instruments adapted to
the degree o f client ownership, development urgency and the Bank’s o w n comparative
advantage in relation to other donors. A selection o f programs across the two main
pillars has been identified for the first two years o f the CPS. Beyond this, the CPS retains
the flexibility to adjust both the selection o f program and the range o f instruments to
changing client demand, development needs and evolving development partnerships.
xii. The CPS lays particular emphasis on non-lending activities. Recognizing that in
several critical reform areas, there is not yet a national consensus around reform priorities
or a well-defined reform roadmap, the Bank will invest in advocating for and building
capacity to implement policy changes through non-lending activities and advisory
services. T o make room for this enhanced non-lending focus, the Bank will target
improvements in the performance o f the investment lending portfolio, aiming at fewer,
larger and more effective interventions.

...

xm.
The CPS proposes a lending range o f US$2-6 billion over four years, with annual
lending levels modulated by a series o f performance benchmarks. Specifically, the Bank
will monitor the maintenance o f an appropriate macroeconomic framework, overall
progress in structural reform, and progress in improving the implementation o f the

..

11

existing portfolio as key performance benchmarks determining the size o f financial
allocations. The maintenance o f an appropriate macroeconomic framework will be a precondition for access t o Development Policy Lending (DPL). Consequently, the share o f
D P L in the total allocation would increase from zero at the bottom o f the lending range
towards 40 percent in the middle o f the range and potentially higher at the top o f the
range.
xiv.
The Bank Group i s strongly committed to harmonizing its assistance with country
systems and coordinating i t s activities with other development partners. Although
collectively the donor community contributes only marginally to Ukraine’s own
investments, the transactions costs for Ukraine o f dealing with external donors remain
high. The CPS proposes to address this issue by continuing to work towards the greater
use o f country systems, where appropriate, and by advocating for policy change and
building capacity, where country systems fall short o f acceptable standards (e.g., in
public procurement). Over time, the Bank aims at channeling an increasing share o f its
resources through the Ukrainian budget, potentially against agreed performance targets,
and together with other donors (e.g. through Sector Wide Approaches - SWAPS).
xv. The CPS i s tied into a results framework which will serve as the main tool for joint
accountability during implementation. Annual Country Portfolio Performance Reviews
(CPPRs) are planned at which an annual results report will be jointly reviewed and
discussed. The Country Team i s investing considerable resources into strengthening
capacity for results, in particular to address the challenge o f h o w to adjust the results
framework to the principles o f flexibility, as well as h o w to reflect the role o f advocacy
work.
The Bank would appreciate guidance from the Executive Directors on the
xvi.
following questions:
Are Ukraine’s development challenges appropriately identified in the CPS and
does the two-pillar structure o f support provide an adequate response?
0

Are the principles o f the CPS o f selectivity, flexibility and partnership and the
resulting selection o f programs appropriate?
I s the lending range acceptable and are the benchmarks modulating between
the levels o f lending adequately defined?

0

I s the results framework realistic and provide for sufficient accountability?

A. ECONOMICCONTEXT

1. Ukraine i s a lower middle income country, with a GDP per capita of US$1940 in
2006. It i s the second largest country o f the former Soviet Union with a population o f 46
million.

2. Ukraine suffered one of the steepest declines of any of the successor states of the
former Soviet Union, with GDP falling to 45 percent of the 1991 level by 1998
(Figure 1). Structural reforms were initially hesitant with Ukraine lagging considerably
behind Russia in the liberalization o f markets, privatization o f state assets and the
foundation o f market-based institutions.

3. Since 2000, however, Ukraine has enjoyed a strong economic recovery, with
growth at around 7.5 percent per year on average (Table 1). The period o f recovery
was initiated by a sustained reform effort that began during the government o f Prime
Minister Yushchenko, n o w Ukraine's President, and continued under subsequent
governments. Macroeconomic stability was established, key industries were privatized
and the process o f legislative and institutional reform was begun. Economic recovery has
benefited from the significant excess capacity in industry, as well as from a favorable
external environment, and an initially strongly undervalued currency. Trade expanded
rapidly, while at the same time, its geographical orientation changed gradually towards
Europe and other markets outside the former Soviet Union. Russia remains Ukraine's
largest single trading partner, however.
4. Structural change has started but remains incomplete. The services sector has
become more important, while agriculture has declined as a share o f GDP and
employment. The industrial sector remains large and dominated by capital-intensive
branches such as iron and steel and industrial chemicals. However, catalyzed by the
steep rise in the price o f imported energy from Russia since 2005, Ukrainian
manufacturing i s undergoing a process o f investment-led modernization. A particular

feature o f Ukraine i s the size o f i t s government sector. A t over 40 percent o f GDP, it i s
uncharacteristically large for a lower middle income country. Over half o f total
employment remained in the public sector as o f 2004'.

5. Ukraine continues to lag behind the EU accession in terms o f economic reform,
although it has caught up with the ECA average (Figure 2). Since 2000, steady but
gradual reform progress has been made, but frequent government changes, and the lack
o f a strong external anchor have been important constraints. An important benchmark
may b e reached in 2007 with W T O accession.

6. Ukraine has one of the largest informal sectors among the transition economies.
The shadow economy i s estimated at around 50 percent o f official GDP2. This has

significant implications for economic diagnostics. For instance, ratios o f k e y variables to
GDP, such as government spending, or the size o f the financial sector, would tend to be
over-estimated. By the same token, trade data tends to suffer from under-reporting, due
to transfer pricing (for exports) and customs evasion (for imports). If the underlying
trade dynamics are different than officially reported, this would affect underlying GDP
growth rates as well. Furthermore, if the dynamics o f the informal sector are different
than those in the formal sector, real incomes may follow a different pattern than
suggested by official statistics. Aside from affecting the reliability o f economic
diagnostics, the large informal sector is a symptom o f pervasive governance problems
and reflects the significant obstacles businesses and individuals face if they seek to
operate according to the existing formal rules.

B. RECENT
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

7 . Rapid economic growth has facilitated a sharp decline in poverty in recent years.
Poverty has fallen sharply f r o m 3 1 percent in 2001 to 8 percent in 20053 (Figure 3).
Ukraine has enjoyed one o f the fastest rates o f poverty reduction in ECA since the onset
o f economic recovery in 2000. However, in spite o f this achievement, the public’s
satisfaction with their material well-being remains l o w (Box 1).

8. Generous increases in social transfers have significantly contributed to reducing
poverty. Real average pensions increased by 34.8 percent in 2004 and another 28.9
percent in 2005. Pension increases, and to a much smaller extent a rise in child benefits,
explain around one-third o f the decline in poverty over the 2004-2005 period. However,
these measures have pushed the size o f the Pay As Y o u Go (PAYG) pension system to 14
percent o f GDP in 2005, one o f the highest ratios in the world. Generous social transfers
are financed by high payroll taxes o f about 35 percent which burden businesses, stimulate
under-reporting o f wage income, and hurt Ukraine’s long-term competitiveness.

although the majority o f the population
remains dissatisfied with their current
standard o f living, a public opinion poll
conducted b y the Kyiv International
Institute o f Sociology, also suggests that
households are more able to buy enough
food to eat (see figure). Individual
perceptions o f well-being would seem to
lag behind falls in the poverty rate.
Nevertheless, the dynamics shown in the
chart are consistent with the Bank’s
findings that over recent years, Ukraine
made huge progress
in poverty
alleviation.

9. Households with many children are particularly vulnerable to poverty (Figure 4).
The incidence o f poverty i s close to 30 percent in households with six or more members,
more than three times the national average. In contrast, the incidence o f poverty i s not
higher than average among pensioners, confirming the positive effect that the recent
increases in pension payments have had. The numbers presented here differ from
Government estimates, according to which, overall poverty remained constant during
2001-2005, and poverty in families with many children, as well as among pensioners, fell

4

by 3.6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively.
Although the
unemployed have a higher incidence o f poverty, in absolute terms, the majority o f the
poor l i v e in households headed by the employed or by pensioners. Returns to education
have been increasing in Ukraine, and so the incidence o f poverty i s declining in more
educated households, an effect that has become steeper over time.

10. T h e doubling o f household energy tariffs between 2005 and 2007 has created a
significant social challenge. From January 2006, import prices for Russian gas
increased by 53 percent and by another 35 percent in January 2007. Consequently,
household tariffs for gas and power were also raised substantially (Figure 5). The size o f
the increase has raised concern about its potentially negative social impact. However,
calculations carried out by the World Bank suggest that because even the poor do not
spend a very large proportion o f their income o n energy, a doubling o f energy prices from
the levels at the end o f 2005 would raise poverty by only 1.7 percentage points.
Moreover, it would cost only US$63 million to restore all those that had become poor as

5

a result o f energy price increases to a spending level just above the poverty line, provided
social assistance was perfectly targeted.4.

11. Ukraine spends a high proportion of GDP on health and education and this i s
reflected in universal access to primary and lower secondary education and to basic
healthcare (Table 2). However, quality i s variable, and spending patterns are highly
inefficient. In education, inequality o f access widens significantly at the upper secondary
level, and is also prevalent in pre-school education, which negatively affects poor
children's educational outcomes. In health care, inequalities in access are determined
both by significant variations in the quality o f service between rural and urban locations,
and by the prevalence o f significant informal payments, which m a y reach a level similar
to total public spending on healthcare. Moreover, public health i s underdeveloped and
health risks from lifestyles, environmental hazards and communicable diseases are high.
Consequently, Ukraine scores l o w for i t s level o f income o n key demographic indicators,

12. A particular social challenge i s Ukraine’s demographic profile. Ukraine is
forecast to lose around 25 percent o f i t s population by 2025 as a result o f s t i l l relatively
high mortality rates and very l o w birth rates5. Moreover, because o f l o w retirement age,
employment rates are l o w in spite o f recent improvements in the labor market. As a
result, Ukraine’s dependency ratio (i.e., the ratio o f Ukraine’s non-working to i t s working
population) was already high at 44.6 percent in 2005. As Ukraine’s population ages, the
overall costs o f providing care to the elderly will also increase, perhaps by as much as 5.2
percent o f GDP by 2020. Ukraine will need to increase its retirement age, improve
employment prospects for those workers that have been discouraged from looking for
work through training and re-training, and potentially open i t s labor market to migrants if
it i s to stem the increase in the dependency ratio. Reforms o f the pension system,
professional training and old-age care, are also urgent to handle the rising costs o f an
aging society.

C. RECENT
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
13. Ukrainian politics in the recent past has been quite volatile. During the period of
implementation o f the previous CAS from 2003 to 2007, Ukraine had no fewer than four
different Governments. Presidential elections in 2004 led to a political shift, as the
chosen successor to former President Kuchma and current Prime Minister, Mr.
Yanukovych, lost against Mr. Yushchenko, who retains the Presidency to date. The shift
in power, often referred to as the “Orange Revolution”, was associated with a significant
increase in political freedom, reduced state control over the media and the emergence of a
vigorous national political debate (see Section I11 and Annex 2 o n the governance
agenda).
14. Important constitutional issues remain unresolved, which has given rise to
additional political tension. Part o f the political compromise that facilitated a re-run of
the 2004 presidential elections and the victory o f Mr. Yushchenko, were amendments to
the constitution that transfer significant powers to the Parliament. However, the
amendments leave considerable ambiguity on respective roles of the Government, the
World Bank. From R e d to Gray, 2007

7

Presidency and the degree o f independence o f the Judiciary. These ambiguities have
been a source o f tension between the Presidency and the Government, in particular,
following the return to power o f Mr. Yanukovych as Prime Minister, after his Regions
Party emerged as the largest party from the parliamentary elections o f March 2006.

15. Tensions came to a head in April 2007, with the President dissolving parliament,
leading to early parliamentary elections on September 30, 2007. The ruling coalition
o f the Party o f the Regions, the Communists and the Socialists was unable to retain i t s
majority. As o f mid-October 2007, n o decision had been taken on the formation o f a new
governing coalition, with many possible combinations actively discussed. Among the
more plausible options i s the return to power o f former Prime Minister Y u l i a
Timoshenko, backed by a coalition o f her party with the pro-presidential faction Our
Ukraine - National Self-Defense. Another government change would fit into the pattern
o f frequent government turnover observed in other Eastern European countries, where
incumbent governments have found i t characteristically difficult to stay in power.

16. Despite the continuous power struggles, the basic vision of economic
development for the country i s broadly shared between all main political forces.
The development vision includes a commitment to closer integration with Europe and
with the world economy at large, exemplified by the progress made in the WTO
accession, and to the further deepening o f structural reforms as the key to sustained
economic growth. This basic vision has survived the frequent changes in government
since the turn o f the millennium and i s reflected in the sequence o f government programs
adopted since the European Choice agenda launched by former President Kuchma in
2003.

17. Despite significant political risks going forward, a compromise remains more
likely than a protracted political stand-off. The economy has taken the recent political
uncertainty in i t s stride and the major business interests which are strongly represented in
all branches o f executive and legislative power have little interest in a drawn-out political
conflict. While it would be desirable for Ukraine to re-establish constitutional clarity and
work to strengthen the rule o f law and the trust in state institutions, the base case
assumption for the current strategy i s a continued muddle-through scenario, in which the
political system generates enough compromise to move forward gradually and sometimes
inconsistently, whilst avoiding reform reversals or a protracted crisis. The nature o f
political risks and mitigation measures i s discussed further in Section V I o f this
document.
18. Ukraine i s receiving increased attention from international partners, in
particular from Europe. The EU launched a new framework agreement with Ukraine
in late 2006, a key provision o f which is the negotiation o f a “deep” Free Trade
Agreement following W T O accession. This goal i s supported by all the dominant
political forces in Ukraine and i s likely to provide the strongest anchor to economic
policy during the period o f implementation o f this CPS. In the political arena, the EU
Ukraine Action Plan foresees the further strengthening o f the r u l e o f law, political and

8

media freedoms. The EU has evaluated progress o n all dimensions positively at the end
of the first year o f the Action Plan in late 2006. Taken together, the European institutions,
comprising the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Commission (EC) i s by far the
largest donor to Ukraine. Ukraine has also qualified for assistance from the Millennium
Challenge Corporation, although the size and timing o f support remains somewhat
uncertain. Russian commercial interests are developing strongly.
Overall, the
international environment is expected to remain supportive to greater economic
integration.

11. RECENT ECONOMIC D E V E L O P M E N T S AND RISKS

A. RECENT ECONOMIC
GROWTH
- DRIVERS
AND PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY
27. Ukraine has consistently exceeded expectations of economic growth over the
period 2000-2007. Growth averaged 7.5 percent, and per capita incomes in US$,
according to the Atlas method, increased from US$700 in 2000 to US$1940 in 2006.

28. T w o factors contributed to this phase of economic “recovery”. First, the financial
stabilization and introduction o f economic reforms in 2000 effectively hardened budget
constraints, bolstered confidence in the Government’s macroeconomic management and
in the country’s fledgling financial sector, and created the legal and institutional basis for
market-based exchange.
29. Second, the real exchange rate depreciation, following the 1998 financial crisis in
Russia and the availability of ample spare capacity in Ukrainian industry, created
conditions where the returns on investment and entrepreneurial initiative were
unusually high. B o t h factors together shifted the incentive structure towards formal
economic relations and away from the rent-seeking predominant in the 1990s. The result
was the emergence o f Ukraine’s particular brand o f capitalism built o n strong domestic
financial industrial groups, which originated thanks to close and often non-transparent
l i n k s to political power brokers, but which were increasingly acting as the motors o f
economic recovery and growth.

30. Ukraine’s transition path to date has two weaknesses: First, the sources o f
recovery and export revenues are highly concentrated in heavy industry, in particular
ferrous metallurgy. Ukraine’s economic performance i s thus vulnerable to a shift in
terms o f trade against the metals sector in particular. Ukraine’s high degree o f energy
inefficiency i s also a main source o f vulnerability. Unlike other Eastern European
countries, Ukraine’s trading patterns were s t i l l heavily oriented towards Russia and
commodity-based, whereas Ukraine’s peers are increasingly developing intra-industry
trade l i n k s with Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries, thereby gradually managing to move up the value
chain6.

31. Second, the political economy that has facilitated Ukraine’s recovery may be a
potential obstacle for further and deeper structural reform, if the dominant domestic
capitalist groups use their political clout to block further liberalization and competition
from foreign investors as well as domestic new entrants. However, to protect and further
grow their wealth, the domestic groups need to clean up their corporate act and might
thereby act as catalysts for a general shift towards greater transparency7.

32. Nonetheless, there are signs of diversification and modernization of production
that support a moderately robust outlook for Ukraine’s economy, at least over the
short- to medium-term. Among the most important developments in this regard since
2004 are:
The significant inflow o f Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2005 and 2006,
buoyed by the re-privatization o f the country’s largest steel mill (Khryvorizhstal)
to a strategic investor (Mittal Steel) and the sell-off o f strategic stakes in some o f
the country’s major banks by the financial industrial groups (Figure 6a). In
western business circles, the “Orange Revolution” put Ukraine o n the map and
investment interest i s significant, including in industries such as retailing, food
processing, light industry, car manufacturing and supplies.
The transformation o f Ukraine’s banking sector and signs o f improvement in
corporate governance practices in the large domestic financial industrial groups
has provided access to finance to a large proportion o f Ukrainian businesses and
households o n an unprecedented scale (Figure 6b). T h i s has relieved constraints
on investment and allowed companies to undertake long-delayed modernization
o f their plant and equipment. Access to capital has allowed Ukraine to adjust
very rapidly to the large energy price shock imposed by the two step increase in
gas import prices from US$62/tcm in 2005 to US$l3O/tcm today.
There i s also micro-economic evidence that Ukraine, during the past 6 years, has
undergone a significant degree o f restructuring, driven in particular by the entry
o f new firms, and that this has contributed to rapid productivity growth as i t did a
decade earlier in Eastern Europe’. M o r e work i s needed to understand the
implications o f these findings and the greater competition among large business
groups for Ukraine’s “insider economy” and the extent to which they are
reflective o f a greater degree o f dynamism and restructuring than had been
suggested by previous analyses.

33. Ukraine’s economy may thus b e more resilient and robust than had earlier been
anticipated. As GDP has recovered to only three quarters o f i t s 1991 level, there would
appear to be ample additional spare capacity that with some additional investment could
easily be brought o n stream. Ukraine’s l o w effectiveness in using i t s existing assets (both
physical and human) is at the same time an opportunity for entrepreneurs that promises

high returns even when the business climate remains far from perfect, as long as there i s
macroeconomic stability and sufficient certainty about property rights.
34. However, U k r a i n e will need to deepen structural reforms sooner o r later in order
to sustain growth at rates o f 6-7 percent per annum which would be required to converge
towards the income levels in Eastern Europe (where growth i s in the 5 percent range). In
the short run, structural reforms may not be a binding constraint on growth, but unless
reforms are accelerated today, growth over the medium-term will suffer. Box 2 below
illustrates the non-linear relationship between structural reforms and growth in an
economy recovering from a deep fall in output.

B. MAINTAINING
MACRO-ECONOMIC
BALANCE
27. W h i l e growth p r i o r to 2004 was export-led, since 2005, domestic demand has
been the main driver. This has led to deterioration o f the current account from a 10.6
percent o f GDP surplus in 2004 to a 1.5 percent o f GDP deficit in 2006. Such a massive
turn-around in the savings-investment balance has raised concerns that Ukraine may b e
pursuing unsustainable macroeconomic policies and needs a combination o f fiscal
tightening and greater exchange rate flexibility to allow external balance to be restored.
Pre- election promises o f further increases in public sector wages and transfers underline

11

the concern that Ukraine may be over-heating. Moreover, cost-push factors (including
the partial pass through o f higher gas import prices to consumers and higher food prices
following a poor 2007 harvest) and rapid monetary growth have lifted inflation to 14.4
percent year-on-year in September 2007. Even excluding energy price effects, the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) has increased significantly over the past year.
28. Domestic demand remains supported by high wage settlements, partially fuelled
b y the public sector. Private sector wage settlements remain high with annual increases
close to 27 percent in July 2007, and recent budget amendments will push the minimum
wage up by 20 percent in 2007. These high settlements m a y reflect growing inflationary
expectations. However, real wage growth has slowed considerably, particularly if
measured against producer prices, and with further increases in utility prices,
consumption growth i s likely t o further abate.
29. The widening current account deficit i s easily financed by private capital
inflows. In 2006, Ukraine attracted a total o f US$14 b i l l i o n in net debt inflows, in
addition to US$5.2 billion in FDI, together amounting to 18 percent o f GDP. Some o f
this money is flight capital returning from abroad and thus reflects the fact that Ukraine i s
now using some o f the savings it accumulated in earlier years. Indeed, given Ukraine’s
investment needs in order t o achieve income convergence, an excess o f investment over
domestic savings and the corresponding inflow o f foreign capital i s warranted. Given
current conditions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that Ukraine could
sustain a current account deficit in the range o f 4-6 percent o f GDP. Ukraine’s fixed
investment to GDP ratio is estimated at 24 percent for 2006, which is still too l o w to
allow incomes to converge.
30. Fiscal policy has been restrained in aggregate but the composition o f spending
remains biased towards consumption and transfers. Fiscal deficits have declined
from 4.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 1.3 percent o f GDP in 2006, staying well below
budget projections. While public consumption expenditures as a share o f GDP have
increased significantly since 2004, as wage and pension payments were hiked, tax
revenue has been equally buoyant, boosted by improved collections, the tightening o f tax
loopholes and strong import-related Value-Added Tax (VAT) performance. However, by
raising the tax burden on producers and redistributing the revenues to consumers, the
authorities have contributed to the fall in private savings.

12

Box 2: Recovery from the Transition Crisis and the Impact of Reform
The Figure below illustrates the interaction between initial output decline and the contribution o f
.eform to economic growth. A country has two available steady state growth paths, depending on
he depth o f structural reforms (which may be thought o f as raising both steady state income
hrough an increase in investment and the long-term rate o f productivity growth - i.e., shifting the
y o w t h path up and making i t steeper). Because o f an initial exogenous output decline, the
:ountry i s below both steady state paths at point A. Even if Ukraine accelerates reforms at that
ioint, the benefits become apparent only after point B.

Inc ne level

t

3 1. Ukraine’s macroeconomic framework on the whole remains adequate, but the
authorities will need to b e vigilant in the face o f potential external shocks o r political
spending pressures. The Bank’s base-case medium-term macroeconomic forecast
provides for a gradual slow-down in the pace o f expansion o f domestic demand and a
corresponding stabilization o f external deficits and declining inflation rates. This
assumes the absence o f a negative external shock and the continuation o f gradual, if
sometimes inconsistent, economic reforms.

32. G r o w t h i s expected at an average o f 5.5 percent p e r year in the medium-term
(Table 3). The k e y assumptions underlying these projections are as follows:

(i)

growth will continue to benefit fi-om bringing under-utilized resources into
production even if structural reforms proceed at modest pace;

(ii) a protracted political stand-off will be avoided;

c. K E Y R I S K S TO THE OUTLOOK
33. The key risk to the outlook i s the combination o f a larger external shock with a
significant tightening of Ukraine’s access to international financing. In such a case,
an exchange rate correction might be required, together with a significant tightening o f
fiscal policy. This would temporarily slow growth, as domestic demand declines and
exports respond with a lag to exchange rate adjustment. Under a malign external
scenario, there would also b e the need to deepen structural reform to return to current
growth rates, as Ukraine would need to reassure international investors that i t remains an
attractive destination for capital. The authorities would need to show determination to
force restructuring in the banking sector and prevent bank failures to translate into quasifiscal liabilities. Ukraine’s current reserves o f relatively “easy growth” would become
more quickly exhausted.

34. Developments during the summer o f 2007 have highlighted these risks.
Triggered by concerns over the fall-out from the sub-prime mortgage market in the
United States, liquidity tightened significantly in international markets between mid-June
and early August. This led to rising risk premia and falls in equity markets worldwide.
14

In Ukraine, too, equity markets have declined somewhat after record gains, and bond
spreads have widened, but reserve accumulation by the National Bank o f Ukraine (NBU)
has continued and liquidity in the banking system remains high. It i s too early to assess
the full implications o f recent developments, and while Ukraine boasts significant
strengths in terms o f i t s macroeconomic fundamentals, it would be vulnerable if a
protracted global downturn were to reduce metal prices at the same time as external
financing became more expensive. Negative developments in other financial markets in
the region, in particular in Russia, could also be a source o f contagion.

35. Second order risks to the outlook are rooted in Ukraine’s volatile political
environment and in the possibility that the authorities would react inappropriately
to a changing external environment. Following the dissolution o f parliament in April,
there has been a gradual re-pricing o f Ukrainian risk in international markets, which
accelerated over the summer. This reflects market perceptions o f political instability as
an additional risk factor, particularly if this was to lead to inappropriate policies, such as
rising fiscal deficits or delayed reactions to exogenous shocks. However, for reasons
mentioned in the preceding section, both risks are mitigated by the interests and political
influence o f big domestic business in the maintenance o f macroeconomic and political
stability.

36. Should Ukraine be faced with an exogenous shock, adjustment would be
complicated by the recent build-up of a strong foreign exchange exposure in the
economy, intermediated b y the banking system, While banking sector assets and
liabilities are reasonably well-matched, many borrowers, particularly Ukrainian
households, are not hedged against a possible exchange rate devaluation. The NBU’s de
facto peg against the U S dollar has arguably reduced these borrowers’ perceptions of
exchange rate risk and thus fuelled the process o f dollarization. This puts the NBU in a
dilemma: in case o f an external (or political) shock, there may be pressure on the
exchange rate, but a large correction would in turn cause difficulties for many banks.
H o w it reacts depends o n whether i t sees the shock as temporary and manageable or
whether i t is permanent and requires adjustment.
37. The NBU intends to move towards greater exchange rate flexibility but has left
the timeframe open. Central bankers point to the current political instability, the
potential negative implications o f initial exchange rate appreciation driven by balance o f
payments inflows on competitiveness, and to the need to develop further the market
conditions for an active monetary policy (including by increasing the circulation and
liquidity o f government securities and the development o f a yield curve) as arguments
against a rapid change in the monetary framework. However, in the event o f a negative
external shock, the NBU is expected to react.

15

38. I t i s also likely that fiscal policy would be supportive o f any required adjustment
and expenditures (most likely on capital spending) would be reduced to prevent an
increase in the fiscal deficit. Despite the risks Ukraine faces, the maintenance o f
macroeconomic stability remains the base case scenario. The present strategy modulates
lending levels and access to DPL against the maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic
framework as detailed further below.
1II.UKRAINE’S DEVELOPMENT C H A L L E N G E S

39. This CPS builds on an analysis o f Ukraine’s key development challenges. As
argued above, Ukraine’s impressive recent economic performance i s due to a
combination o f factors, including progress in key dimensions o f building a market
economy, the degree o f the country’s initial output decline, and the good fortune o f a
highly supportive international environment. T o sustain growth into the future, however,
Ukraine will need to address three key challenges: (i)the improvement in
competitiveness, (ii)
the reform o f public finance and the public sector to improve service
delivery and make growth socially inclusive, and (iii)
tackling weaknesses in governance.
These challenges are briefly outlined below. A more detailed assessment can be found in
Annex 1 (on economic development challenges) and Annex 2 (on governance
challenges).

A. SUSTAINING

GROWTH
AND IMPROVING
COMPETITIVENESS

40. The drivers o f recent growth in Ukraine are temporary - t h e foundations for
sustained growth over the medium- and long-term s t i l l need to b e laid. After 15
years o f independence, during which the country’s inherited capital stock has undergone
little modernization, the need for increased investment and depreciation o f existing assets
i s high. This poses significant challenges to both the private and the public sectors.

41. Moreover, given demographic trends, Ukraine will r e q u i r e large productivity
improvements if it i s to finance t h e costs o f an aging population. Growth in total
factor productivity has been the predominant source o f growth in all ECA countries since
the start o f reform and this i s likely to remain the case going forward. While to date total
factor productivity (TFP) growth has been boosted by rising capacity utilization and the
reduction o f hidden unemployment, particularly in industry, these relatively “easy” gains
from defensive restructuring are not likely to be available for much longer.

42. A combination o f challenges needs to be addressed to achieve growth and
improve competitiveness going forward:
0

Ukraine needs to become better at adopting new technologies and nurturing the
skills and institutional environment to promote innovation and technological
adaptability and thus shift production towards higher value added goods.

16

The business climate needs to b e improved to encourage private investment and
increase competition on the domestic market, including by reducing subsidies to
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and promoting a level playing field.
0

Financial markets need to deepen further and regulation needs to improve to
contain financial market risks.
Ukraine needs t o address behind the border obstacles to transit and trade in
order to benefit fully from recent progress in trade liberalization and the
prospect o f imminent accession to the WTO.
Ukraine needs to increase the energy efficiency o f i t s economy and thus reduce
its vulnerability t o further import price shocks, as w e l l as modernize the energy
sector itself to make it more efficient and competitive.

43. A new challenge, but also a unique opportunity to improve Ukraine’s image and
attractiveness for investors, i s the E u r o 2012 Football Championships, which
Ukraine was awarded to host jointly with Poland. This decision will have a major
impact on infrastructure investments in the country and has the potential t o attract
significant private investment for the modernization o f transport, municipal infrastructure

as w e l l as the tourism sector in the next five years.
organizational arrangements and k e y challenges.

Box 3: Euro 2012
Between 800,000 and 900,000 spectators are expected to visit Ukrainian stadiums for the Euro
2012. Around 200,000 tourists are anticipated and their additional spending may total UAH 1
billion (US$0.2 billion) or 0.2 percent o f 2006 GDP. Direct spending on the renovation of
stadiums and on additional security measures may amount to around UAH 10-15 billion (US$2-3
billion), with government spending needs estimated at around UAH 8 billion (mainly for security
and for the renovation o f the K y i v Olympic stadium).
In addition, Ukraine has to invest in infrastructure which i s not directly related to football, such as
creating 30,000-50,000 hotel beds, reconstructing airports, building roads and modernizing
railroads. The precise requirements imposed on Ukraine by the European Soccer Association
(UEFA) are not known, and reliable cost estimates are difficult to obtain. Nonetheless, it i s clear
that the Euro 2012 i s likely to swallow a considerable share o f the public investment budget and
may in addition catalyze significant private investment. The potential positive impact on growth,
private investment and the long-term modernization o f Ukraine i s important, but the risks o f
overly costly and misguided investments and o f macroeconomic imbalances resulting from the
surge in spending or implicit and explicit government guarantees are also significant.

B. PUBLIC FINANCE,
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND IMPROVED PUBLIC SERVICE
DELIVERY

44. While the private sector has begun the process o f modernization, public sector

macroeconomic stability and to harden budget constraints. I t also continues to generate
sufficient tax revenues to support a large public bureaucracy and deliver an important
range o f public services and social transfers. However, the scope and size o f government

17

comes at the cost o f a high tax burden, pervasive red tape, l o w quality in the delivery o f
public services, limited capacity to prioritize and the crowding out o f critical public
investments by the size o f government consumption.
45. Ukraine’s public sector i s one of the largest among other lower-middle income
countries, yet the quality o f service delivery i s regarded as highly deficient by i t s
population. As around 42 percent o f GDP, public sector spending in Ukraine i s around
twice as high as in comparable middle income countries in Asia and Latin America.
Education spending at 6.5 percent o f GDP i s above the OECD average. Public health
spending i s lower at 3.7 percent o f GDP, but may be twice as large again once out o f
pocket payments o f the population are taken into account. Yet, in recent survey
evidence, Ukraine ranks near the bottom o f all countries in E C A in terms o f public
perceptions o f the quality o f health and education services.’ Similarly, the P A Y G
pension system swallows around 14 percent o f GDP, but replacement rates are low, and
decreases with rising incomes, reducing compliance incentives.
46. In contrast to large and rising public consumption and transfer spending, public
capital spending i s low and badly prioritized and managed. Subtracting state
transfers to SOEs capital spending has ranged barely above 2 percent o f GDP in recent
years, less than h a l f the level in the new EU member states and around one fifth o f the
level in East Asia. High consumption spending and wasteful subsidies to SOEs crowd
out public investment, but even the limited investment that does take place suffers from a
highly discretionary, unpredictable and poorly executed capital budgeting process.

47. Ukraine has made significant improvements in public financial management,
but retains key weaknesses in public procurement, management of state-owned
enterprises and medium-term budget planning. A recent Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment found Ukraine outperformed many o f i t s
peers o n the credibility, predictability, and execution o f i t s budget. However, the same
assessment also identified k e y weaknesses in public procurement (see B o x 4),
management o f the quasi-fiscal activities o f state-owned enterprises, and the consistency
o f the budget with medium-term strategic priorities.

48, The strong performance o f Ukraine’s budget system nonetheless provides an
important entry point to the reform of public services, by emphasizing the potential
for quality enhancement at n o additional cost if current internal rules and processes are
reformed to allow for greater incentives to improve efficiency. This will need to include
strengthening the role, autonomy and accountability o f local government. lo

In 2005, Ukraine spent more than US$4 billion, around 5 percent o f GDP, on public procurement.
The existence o f regulatory framework that guarantees a transparent, competitive and thereby
cost-effective process i s thus o f considerable importance for the country.
Until late 2004, Ukraine’s public procurement system underwent a process o f gradual
improvements, with the number of tenders conducted on an open basis, increasing from 7 percent
Gust under 50 percent o f total value) in 2002 to 26 percent (69 percent o f total value). Solesource contracts were correspondingly reduced to 10 percent o f the total (15 percent o f value).

A series of amendments to the public procurement law in November 2004, June 2005, December
2005, and December 2006 have seriously diluted and fragmented government procurement
authority. Important functions have been transferred from the Authorizing Agency in the
Ministry o f Economy to the Center for Tender Procedures and Business Planning (CTP), a NonGovernmental Organization (NGO), not subject to the same controls routinely imposed on bodies
o f public administration. The CTP officially holds patents and copyrights for numerous bidding
documents, including standard bidding documents nearly identical to those o f the World Bank,
which it sells to bidders against a fee. Market participants complain o f pressure by the CTP to
use their copyrighted documents and to pay for questionable services, including commissions o n
successful bids. Moreover, the fully decentralized public procurement system has created
significant capacity problems among procuring entities. Market participants complain about
insufficient access to information, unclear bidding documents, insufficient time to prepare bids,
unjustified cancellation o f tender procedures, and frequent delays in contractual payments.
Such practices have discouraged competition and given rise to significant governance concerns.
Supervisory functions are another major concern, Supervisory functions were transferred by
legal amendments in 2005 from the Authorizing Agency to the control and revision unit o f the
M o F and the Accounting Chamber, creating conflicts o f interest, since the procurement entities
were now supervised by the same bodies that also audit them. In December 2006, further legal
amendments created a Special Control Commission. However, the decisions o f the commission
can be challenged by the CTP in court, further enhancing the powers o f this non-government
body.
The need for Ukraine to fundamentally overhaul the present system and return to the path o f
harmonizing its public procurement rules with acceptable international practice i s increasingly
recognized. I t i s a trigger in the World Bank’s DPL program and also a condition for Ukraine to
receive budget support from the EC. A new draft law has been prepared and it i s to be hoped that
it would be adopted soon in the new parliament, taking into account international best practice.

GOVERNANCE
AND PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR REFORM

49. Governance weaknesses are at the r o o t o f m a n y o f the r e f o r m challenges listed
above. Ukraine continues to rank poorly on comparative indicators o f governance,
although i t has improved notably since 2004. Transparency International’s Corruption
Perceptions Index ranks Ukraine 99th out o f 163 in 2006. However, improvements are
notable since 1998, a fact that i s also confirmed by enterprise surveys such as the
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS). Annex 2 contains a
more comprehensive governance diagnostic.

19

50. In part as a result of political instability and pervasive corruption, people’s
confidence in public institutions i s very low. Ukrainians display among the lowest
level o f trust in public institutions in ECA. At the same time, people’s expectations o f
what the state should deliver remain high - individual or collective initiatives to address
local issues such as the quality o f schools, health services, or municipal and housing
services remain hesitant, albeit growing significantly from a very l o w base. While most
people support the move to a market economy and democracy, in Ukraine this has not yet
translated into acceptance o f a reduced role o f the state and greater personal
responsibility’

’.

5 1. Strong vested interests have so far blocked serious administrative reforms, and
the judiciary does not serve as a guarantor of people’s rights. Byzantine bureaucratic
structures and a politicized c i v i l service in all important senior positions have tended to
slow down decision making processes, make them more opaque and subject to frequent
revisions when key personnel changes. This has complicated efforts to modernize public
institutions. The large World Bank portfolio in support o f these efforts has disbursed
slowly. The judiciary i s perceived to b e corrupted, while a lack o f investment and
training o f court staff further serve to undermine the credibility o f the courts. People and
businesses generally seem to have l i t t l e recourse to an objective third party if their rights
have been infringed upon, all the more so if the infringement has been committed by a
public official.

52. As a result, Ukraine finds itself in a low-equilibrium accountability trap.
People’s trust in the state i s l o w and their willingness to support the move towards greater
individual responsibility i s muted because they feel the state is not reciprocating with
efforts to improve the quality o f services. This creates a significant challenge for reform:
the analysis presented above suggests that improvements in public services will need to
come primarily from a reform in financing arrangements and greater local accountability.
Yet, these reforms are not priorities for the majority o f the population, while the
corresponding staffing and structural changes are likely to run into the resistance o f
interest groups.

53. This diagnosis suggests that efforts to improve Governance and Anti-Corruption
(GAC) will require advocacy to generate greater understanding of and demand for
reforms that increase the accountability of the public sector and stimulate greater
private initiative. The strategic implications for the Bank are that the attempt t o reform
state institutions, through investment lending projects with the central government, needs
to be complemented with greater efforts to stimulate demand for good governance. This
i s spelled out in greater detail in Annex 2.

IV. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
54. A broad political consensus exists in Ukraine around deepening international
integration, maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening the functioning of
markets, improving the quality of public services and broadening social inclusion.
This consensus has remained at the core o f government policy throughout recent political
changes. I t was reflected in the “European Choice” program o f President Kuchma, on
which the previous strategy was built, as well as in the “Meeting the People” program o f
the Tymoshenko government that assumed power following the victory o f President
Yushchenko in the elections o f 2004. The same themes are also articulated in the draft
medium-term program prepared by the coalition government between the Regions Party,
the Socialist Party o f Ukraine and the Communist Party o f Ukraine. Table 4 compares
the main pillars o f these three strategic documents by programmatic themes. This
demonstrates the consensus that exists around key themes, such as improving the
business climate and promoting innovation, international integration and trade, reforming
social assistance and pensions, and improving public services, in particular in the areas o f
health, education, and environmental protection.

55. M o r e recently the authorities have paid greater attention to the modernization
o f physical infrastructure. In this, the authorities are responding to the investment
needs and reacting to the dramatic increase in energy prices since the start o f 2006.
56. Maximizing Ukraine’s unique potential as a transit country i s a top government
priority going forward, Consequently, the government has provided ample room for
external borrowing by Ukravtodor (the State Road Agency) and Ukrzaliznytzya (the State
Railways) to finance upgrading o f roads, complete electrification o f the railway network
and purchases o f new rolling stock. The government also plans to upgrade several
airports, attract private investment into its sea ports, and modernize i t s power
transmission and gas pipeline network. The authorities are keen t o attract private
investment to these areas, and are working o n legislation to facilitate this. The European
football championship Euro 2012 i s expected to provide a k e y impetus in this area.
57. Energy efficiency has become imperative as Ukraine moves closer to world
market prices for imported gas. Apart from international financial institution (IF1)financed investments in the generation and transmission system, the government i s also
re-launching privatization o f distribution companies (initially by selling minority stakes)
and promoting private investment to increase energy efficiency through tax incentives.

58. The municipal and housing sector i s receiving particular attention. The
government created a dedicated Ministry for Housing and Municipal Utilities in March
2007, i s working on a new Housing Code, and has allocated significant sums in the 2007
budget and beyond for urgent rehabilitation and repair o f the housing stock. The budget
code continues to subject municipal borrowing to tight central control, but bond issues
and guarantees to utilities by municipalities (which are allowed under the budget code),
are nonetheless increasing in reflection o f this emerging priority.

59. I m p r o v e m e n t s in the investment climate h a v e b e e n delayed d u e to political
instability, but t h e agenda i s expected to b e resumed once a n e w government i s
formed. K e y laws at a fairly advanced stage o f preparation include a new Joint Stock
Company Law, changes to the banking law and law on financial services that would force
disclosure o f beneficiary owners and move Ukraine towards consolidated and in a second
stage risk-based supervision o f banks and non-bank financial institutions. The adoption
o f a new inspections law confirms the commitment to reducing obstacles to business
development. All o f these legislative initiatives have roots dating back to the Orange
Revolution and were in fact included in the matrix o f policy actions supported by the first
DPL. A second D P L i s being prepared in parallel with this CPS and confirms the
continuity o f the reform agenda. However, experience indicates that implementation of
this agenda i s likely to continue to be gradual and i t s sequencing not easily predictable.
This calls for a flexible mode o f support in policy-based lending going forward.

22

60. The authorities are aware o f the challenge to improve agricultural
competitiveness, but the establishment o f a functioning land market has been
repeatedly delayed. WTO accession and the subsequent negotiations over a FTA with
the EU are highlighting the need to modernize Ukraine’s agricultural and food processing
sector to be internationally competitive. However, a k e y reform in this regard - namely
the establishment o f secure and tradable property r i g h t s over agricultural land - has
stalled. l2
61. In the area of public finance and public sector reform, efforts going forward
are likely to concentrate on tax and pension reform, as well as improvements in
public financial management. The Government has adopted a tax concept that lays out
the strategic directions o f tax policy going forward and embraces the goal o f reducing the
tax burden over time through improved compliance. A tax code embodying these
strategic directives has been designed but i t s approval may be delayed. An additional
challenge in improving compliance i s pension reform. T h i s was initiated in 2003, when a
framework law introducing a second mandatory pillar to the pension system was passed,
but progress stalled as the government struggled to cope with the impact o f large
minimum pension increases. The second pillar introduction i s currently planned for
2009. Moreover, the unification o f pension and other social insurance contributions i s
also planned, thus reducing compliance costs. Both measures would over time serve to
increase compliance and allow payroll taxes to be reduced. In the area o f public financial
management, a key initial step will be the reform o f the state procurement system. A
concept paper o n public financial management reform has also been prepared and will
serve as a basis for the Bank’s support in this area. K e y policy measures are included in
the DPL program, prepared in parallel with this CPS.
62. In the social sectors, the authorities have yet to articulate their reform
strategies. Strategic planning capacity in the Ministries o f Health and Education i s
weak, and reform initiatives have largely concentrated o n improving working conditions
by raising salaries o f public sector employees. There i s a National Health Reform
strategy, which includes important concepts, such as the move towards preventive,
primary care and towards greater financial autonomy o f budget units in targeting health
outcomes. The introduction o f mandatory health insurance has also been discussed. In
the education sector, efforts have concentrated o n the introduction o f standardized
performance tests, and this may serve as a basis for a consistent effort to improve quality
throughout the education system. However, implementation capacity in the line
ministries i s weak, and progress will, to a large extent, depend o n changes in sector
financing.
63. Institutional reforms, including reforms of the judiciary and o f public
administration, are high on the political agenda, but implementation remains
uncertain. The weaknesses in Ukraine’s public administration and in the judiciary were
12

A legal framework for the establishment o f a unified registry o f rights in immovable property and a land
cadastre has been developed, but a consensus has yet to be reached over its implementation and the
moratorium on the sale o f agricultural land remains in place.

23

highlighted above. A c i v i l service law has been drafted in compliance with EU
standards, but i t s approval remains uncertain. T w o presidential decrees outline the
country’s vision o n judicial reform. Yet without a resolution o f the underlying
constitutional issues, a fundamental reform o f the judiciary seems difficult. Efforts are
more likely to concentrate o n improving material conditions in the judicial system, and
modernizing the courts so as to lay a basis for more efficient operations and increased
credibility in the eyes o f the public. M o r e generally, institutional reforms in the public
sector have tended to lag reform measures designed to support private sector
development. T h i s pattern m a y continue.

V. WORLD BANK GROUP S T R A T E G Y
A. LESSONS
LEARNED
FROM THE 2003-2007 C A S
The CAS Completion Report (CAS CR)
64. The C A S CR notes that the CAS was broadly aligned with the development
priorities expressed in Ukraine’s “European Choice” agenda developed in 2003
(Annex 3). The robustness o f this construction i s apparent in the fact that the authorities
and the Bank jointly agreed not to change the assistance framework during the mid-term
review in 2005, although the Government had changed in the meantime following the
“Orange Revolution” o f late 2004.
65. Ukraine, over the period o f the 2003-2007 CAS, achieved or even exceeded
many o f the long-term development outcomes set as targets under the CAS. Growth
exceeded projections, public debt levels declined, and Ukraine made significant progress
in trade liberalization and financial sector development. The political changes at the end
o f 2004 brought significant improvements in media freedoms and the expression o f
political voices. In the social dimension, progress was mixed, as the significant reduction
in poverty was not matched by similar progress in other social indicators.
66. The overall positive assessment notwithstanding, the C A S CR highlights the
variability o f results across pillars and areas o f engagement. Thus work o n
macroeconomic stabilization, financial sector development and international integration
was successful, whereas work to improve corporate governance and the environment for
private sector development, was less successful. While poverty reduction was achieved
as a result o f rising incomes, the much needed reform o f social assistance and insurance
systems advanced less rapidly than had been hoped for. Similar variability in outcomes
i s observed within the social sectors, with some progress in access to education but
limited advances in the reform o f health care, the containment o f the HIV/AIDS and TB
epidemics, or in improved quality o f municipal services. The public sector governance
agenda advanced in the area o f public financial management, but stalled in public
procurement and in the reform o f public administration.

24

67. This variability in outcomes i s also observed across instruments. M a n y o f the
results achieved during the CAS period can be attributed to adjustment lending (initially
the Program Adjustment Loan (PAL) program later transformed into the D P L program).
By contrast, investment lending contributed only marginally to the achievement o f results
during the CAS period, both because investment lending operations naturally take longer
to achieve results, but also because their implementation was highly uneven, with many
projects experiencing preparation, effectiveness and implementation delays.
The
integration o f investment lending into the results framework was incomplete.
Recognizing the implementation problems in the investment lending portfolio, the Bank
carried out an Investment Lending Review in 2005, the recommendations o f which are
being implemented (see B o x 5).
68. The authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to improve the
effectiveness of investment lending. Notably, a Working Group o n improving the
effectiveness o f lending by IFIs was set up in the government in 2006. The Chamber o f
Accounts has also issued a report reviewing IF1 lending. I t should be emphasized that
several investment loans were completed rapidly and successfully during the previous
CAS period, including Treasury-I, EDP-I, or Kyiv District Heating, to list a few
examples (a full l i s t i s provided in Annex 3).
69. The C A S CR draws the following lessons from the review of outcomes and
their variability during the 2003-2007 C A S implementation:
Institutionally capable and committed counterparts support effectiveness.
Weak institutions are less likely to implement agreements even if there i s a high
level o f formal “ownership.” However, the capacity to implement i s not fixed and
can increase through strong political mandates, good leadership and institutional
reform.
Linkages across themes reinforce the effectiveness of interventions. For
instance, improving payments and fiscal discipline has helped make further
progress in the financial and the energy sectors. Opportunities for further
strengthening o f linkages are in public financial management (including intergovernmental fiscal relations) and the delivery o f social services.
Clear objectives are not enough to achieve results. Effectiveness requires not
only a clear vision, including expected results, but an understanding o f the
remedies to remove the barriers to achieve them. The Bank must understand
political economy constraints to implementation and work o n reform roadmaps
that allow it to overcome these constraints.

A broad agenda risks wide variability of results. The 2003 C A S agenda was
broad because it endeavored to cover most aspects o f the government agenda.
The price has been a wide variability o f results. With hindsight, greater
selectivity would have helped improve the quality o f the overall delivery.
Selectivity requires putting in place rules o f engagement and enforcing them.
Flexibility helps move in areas o f opportunity and drop slow-moving agendas

25

Box 5: Portfolio Performance and the Investment Lending Review
During the CAS period, six new investment loans were approved and new commitments
amounted to US$629 million, around half o f the total. Disbursements however were only
US$241 million, or around 21 percent o f total disbursements. The total investment loan portfolio
remained steady at between 11-12 operations, o f which 3-4 were in problem status in each year o f
the CAS. Projects at risk thus accounted for around one third o f the total, with commitments at
risk rising through the CAS period to 46 percent in FY07 (largely because the single largest
operation - the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre Development project - moved into the risk
category in that year).
Ukraine’s portfolio has consistently been one o f the weakest in the region, with high risk levels,
l o w disbursements, long preparation times, effectiveness delays and a large number o f dropped
projects. Under these circumstances it i s not surprising that investment lending has not
contributed effectively to achieving CAS results. T o begin to address these challenges, the Bank
carried out an Investment Lending Review in 2005. The 2005 Investment Lending Review
proposed to: (a) restructure or cancel non-performing projects; (b) reduce the institutional
complication o f investment projects; (c) move to a greater use o f country systems; (e) encourage
the government to simplify its procedures, and (f) improve internal coordination within the Bank
teams.

The Bank and the government have advanced in cleaning up the portfolio o f Bank projects
through cancellations or re-programming. In addition, new operations have sharper objectives
and are less institutionally loaded, which should make i t easier to implement and evaluate results.
Greater use o f country systems i s making progress by skfting disbursements under all projects
with the central government to the treasury. Nonetheless, disbursement rates, although
improving, remain low, and preparation and implementation times are well above E C A and Bank
averages. The new performance standards developed jointly by the Bank and the authorities
during the 2007 CPPWCPS are designed to address the persistent problems in investment
lending.
0

Achieving results demands sustained efforts that combine the use o f various
instruments. Although there may be cases o f quick wins, in most circumstances,
progress came about through a combination o f intensive dialogue supported by
analytical work and adjustment, and, in a few cases, investment. While there
must remain room for exploration and innovation, this requires expectations to be
properly managed.

70. Going forward, the C A S CR recommends greater selectivity in the choice of
areas o f engagement, whilst arguing for a thematic approach that recognizes
synergies across interventions a n d directly addresses the trade-offs between client
ownership and development needs. It therefore recommends a combination o f
interventions in areas with strong delivery potential with a presence in key strategic
arenas, where progress has lagged and where this risks holding back development
progress as a whole.

71.

T h e report also urges the Bank to maintain flexibility, both across areas o f
engagement a n d across instruments, a n d suggests to p r o g r a m activities on a rolling
basis. It recommends the greater use o f Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) to
build ownership in areas where reforms are slow-moving, both as background for the
design o f development policy and investment lending. Such AAA should also reveal

26

potential implementation obstacles prior to embarking on new lending commitments and
thereby limit the variability o f results.

72. With regard to investment lending, the CAS CR suggests moving towards
clearer rules of engagement and performance standards to complement the
attention o n internal processes in project preparation on t h e Ukrainian side during
t h e 2003-2007 CAS.
73. Finally, the report strongly encourages greater cooperation both across the
W o r l d B a n k Group (WBG) and with other donors, and recommends the Bank to
intensify the dialogue o n the challenges o f transition with a broad group o f stakeholders
in Ukraine.

The Country Assistance Evaluation
74. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation o f the Bank’s support to
Ukraine f r o m FY99 through F Y 0 6 echoes many o f t h e findings o f t h e Bank’s CAS
CR. I t evaluates the Bank’s assistance across three broad pillars: (i)Sustainable
Economic Growth and Integration into the World Economy, (ii)
Public Sector Reform,
and (iii)
Poverty Reduction and Comprehensive and Harmonized Human Development.
The outcomes o f the Bank’s assistance are rated moderately satisfactory overall, with a
satisfactory, moderately satisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory across the three
pillars. Within each pillar, ratings also differ across activities, highlighting the variability
o f outcomes across a broadly-based program. While the overall assessment o f the IEG
report i s somewhat less positive than the Bank’s o w n assessment, the ranking of
outcomes across pillars and activities i s broadly consistent.

75. IEG further rates t h e institutional development impact o f t h e Bank’s
assistance as modest, in particular with reference to l i m i t e d progress in the r e f o r m
o f public administration and remaining governance problems. Risks are regarded as
significant and the report takes the view that Ukraine’s unexpectedly strong economic
performance may not be sustained without a deepening o f structural reforms and
improvements in public and private sector governance. The IEG report confirms the
positive impact that adjustment lending had o n advancing the policy reform agenda in
Ukraine, while noting that the breadth o f engagement in investment lending may have
reduced i t s effectiveness.
76. Going forward, t h e IEG evaluation makes the following recommendations.
The Bank’s response to these recommendations i s contained in Annex 4:

27

*

Strategy. The Bank strategy should strive for greater selectivity, focusing o n
public financial management, PSD, energy, and social protection, and within
these areas, on improving governance and institutional development.
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). The Bank should be placing greater
emphasis than in the past o n private sector development and infrastructure.
Investment lending. A tighter alignment i s needed between investment
projects and the government priorities. In addition, the Bank should simplify
investment projects and reduce their scale to match implementation capacity,
and ensure line ministries’ engagement in project preparation, and also their
more direct involvement in project implementation, avoiding off-line Project
Implementation Units (PIUs).
Adjustment lending. A shift from broad, multi-sectoral loans to loans that are
more narrowly focused and disbursed in a single tranche i s appropriate for
Ukraine, which would also provide the opportunity for follow up and deeper
policy and institutional reforms.

B. OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
Operational Principles

77. Three principles underlie the operational approach in this CPS: (i)selectivity,
(ii)flexibility and (iii)partnerships. These principles are directly derived from the
lessons o f experience in the previous CAS. They are also fully consistent with emerging
best practice in Middle Income Countries (MICs).
78. In preparing this CPS, the Bank, together with the authorities, has developed
an operational framework to select programmatic areas for i t s future engagement.
The operational framework i s presented in Annex 5 o f this CPS. The framework
proposes a typology o f programmatic interventions, including:

(i) core programs - where the Bank would support government reform efforts
through the entire range o f instruments at i t s disposal;

(ii) development programs - where Bank interventions would be targeted at
developing a reform path, or complementing the efforts already under way by
other donors (Annex 6 provides an overview over the activities o f other
donors);

(iii)advocacy programs - where there i s as yet insufficient ownership and public
support for the necessary reforms and Bank efforts would consequently focus
on creating greater consensus and demand for change.

79. The framework will be applied flexibly over the course o f the CPS. An initial
selection o f programs for financial years 2008 and 2009 i s proposed below. However,

28

the selection remains open to modification at a mid-term review, as reform priorities
evolve, as the consensus in support o f a reform path develops, and as the Bank
determines i t s particular role in the concert o f other donor support. The flexibility will
also extend t o support instruments, ranging from traditional investment lending, DPLs,
through more innovative instruments, including increasing focus on performance-based
budget support, and moving towards SWAPS.

80. A particular focus of the CPS will be on non-lending interventions, with
particular attention placed on timeliness, dissemination and communication to
achieve greater impact. Commensurately, the Bank will aim to deliver fewer, larger
and better financial support operations, in order to make room for greater non-lending
support in the Bank’s administrative budget. By implication, improvements in the
performance o f the existing lending portfolio will need to remain at the center o f the
Bank’s efforts during the CPS.

81. T h e framework also takes into account the specific role of the IFC. The IFC’s
ability to work directly with private sector clients and i t s expanding advisory services,
will allow it to provide significant support in areas where the private sector can act as a
catalyst for reform. The CPS thus integrates the different comparative advantages o f
IFC, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the Foreign Investment
Advisory Service (FIAS) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) into a coherent framework.
Lending Range and Benchmarks

82. Ukraine has greatly improved i t s external creditworthiness since the last C A S
was approved. The public debt to GDP ratio has fallen to less than 15 percent o f GDP;
growth has been maintained at high rates, and inflation has remained at moderate levels.
Fitch upgraded Ukraine’s Sovereign Long Term Foreign Debt Rating to BB- in January
2005 (upgrading the outlook to positive in October 2006), while Standard and Poor’s
followed in M a y 2005. The OECD transferred Ukraine from the sixth to the fifth risk
group in i t s classification o f export credit risk in January 2007. These improvements
have been reflected in growing international market access, and overall the appetite for
Ukrainian risk remains reasonably strong despite a gradual re-pricing o f Ukrainian risk in
the international bond market since M a y 2007, in line with developments in other
emerging markets.
83. T h e size of Ukraine’s economy in U S dollar terms has tripled since 2000 and i s
set to continue to grow further. As with many other transition economies, Ukraine,
over the medium-term, i s expected to experience further real exchange rate appreciation.

84. Taking into account Ukraine’s substantial investment needs (estimated at
US$lOO billion over ten years) and the significant growth of i t s economy since the
last CAS, the CPS proposes a lending range of between US$2 to 6 billion over a four
year period. The proposed lending range i s around 30 percent higher than that provided

29

for in the previous CAS, which is, however, considerably less than the expansion o f the
U S dollar GDP since 2003. At the same time, the Bank has not been able to fully utilize
the base-case lending envelope during the previous CAS, on account o f delays in meeting
key policy lending conditionality and in investment lending preparation. Therefore, this
CPS proposes a more flexible architecture with lending levels within the overall range
modulated by progress in reforms, maintenance o f an appropriate macro-economic
framework and improvements in portfolio implementation and project preparation. In
respect o f the latter, it i s expected that as the Bank consciously moves towards fewer but
larger projects, with fewer investments in complex institutional reforms, project
preparation and implementation will speed up considerably. Thus, in infrastructure,
disbursement rates have tended to be above 20 percent as against 3-5 percent in projects
supporting institutional reforms.
85. DPL i s expected to decline in relative importance during the CPS period from
up to half of planned total lending to around 40 percent. Access to D P L lending
would be contingent o n the maintenance o f an adequate macroeconomic framework, as
detailed below. Thus, at the l o w end o f the lending range, the share o f D P L lending
would be zero, increase to around 40 percent in the middle o f the range, and above that
level, subject to stronger progress o n reform and government demand. This implies a
target size for DPLs in the middle o f the lending range o f around US$300-400 million per
annum. The target size takes into account the current pace o f policy reforms, which
requires a re-calibration o f the D P L program in terms o f i t s ambition. Large but less
frequent D P L operations could also be considered, but the strategic orientation for the
CPS i s to design a D P L program that i s feasible to be implemented in annual sequences
in order to maintain momentum and avoid the long delays in the previous CAS. This
includes the possibility t o move towards thematic DPLs in support o f the two CPS pillars
respectively, which would allow support to be concentrated and bundled in a particular
area each year, with the two D P L series designed to alternate, but with the flexibility to
move faster in one area than in the other. At the top o f the lending range, two parallel
D P L series in support o f a comprehensive and deep reform program in both CPS pillars
could be envisaged.

86. K e y benchmarks to modulate the level of financial assistance would include:
0

0

Maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The maintenance o f an
adequate macroeconomic framework would be a pre-condition for access to DPL
lending. In the absence o f satisfactory macroeconomic policies, n o D P L lending
would be provided and the overall level o f assistance would drop to the bottom o f
the lending range.
For Ukraine to move towards the top o f the lending range, additionally, action to
address current macroeconomic risks, by gradually introducing a more flexible
exchange rate framework, improving financial sector supervision and reducing the
share o f consumption and transfers in the overall budget, while maintaining
overall fiscal discipline and l o w public sector debt levels, would be k e y
benchmarks.

30

Satisfactory progress in improving portfolio implementation. Reductions in
project preparation times and increased disbursement rates would b e k e y targets
to permit lending to expand towards the top o f the range. Conversely, should
portfolio performance deteriorate further from current levels, lending would
remain near the bottom o f the lending range.
0

The degree o f progress o n structural reforms (including governance), which
would be evaluated comprehensively, would also modulate lending levels.
Naturally, without overall progress measured against a set o f reform milestones
and benchmarks defined in the accompanying D P L I1 document, the D P L
program would not proceed and investment lending would also remain at the
bottom o f the range. Conversely, to progress towards the top o f the lending
range, successful implementation o f D P L I1 and D P L I11 would be an important
benchmark.

CPS PILLARSAND OBJECTIVES

87. I n response to the development challenges summarized in Section 111, this CPS
proposes a two pillar strategy of support. The first pillar has the overall objective to
contribute to sustained economic growth and improve the competitiveness o f Ukraine.
T h e second pillar’s objective is the reform o f public finance and administration and the
improvement o f public services. The choice o f a two-pillar construction reflects the aim
to maximize synergies across thematic areas and at the same time emphasize selectivity
in the choice o f programs.
88. The CPS emphasizes the strong links and synergies between increasing
investments in infrastructure on the one hand, and improvements in the investment
climate and in conditions for private businesses on the other. Improved infrastructure
services have a direct positive impact o n the investment climate. At the same time,
improvements in the investment climate facilitate the attraction o f private investment to
address key infrastructure needs.

89. Similarly, the CPS emphasizes the links between reforming public finance and
public administration and improvements in the quality o f public services. Only if
budgets are allocated in a way that rewards good performers, and spending units are
given the authority to decide h o w t o allocate money, and fiduciary controls are adequate
to prevent inefficient spending or leakage o f funds, can public services be improved. But
ultimately, it i s also true that only through improvements in public services will the state
regain the credibility and authority that i s key to reducing monitoring and enforcement
costs and thus making the public sector more efficient. However, the approach chosen in
this strategy i s to use the reforms o f public financial management and the administration
o f social assistance and insurance as entry points into a dialogue o n improving public
service quality. This choice reflects the lessons learned that only through strong
ownership at the level o f the MoF can interventions aimed at improving service quality
succeed.

31

90. Within these two broad pillars, ten programs have been identified based on the
Bank’s existing activities and matched to key government priorities. The ten
programs have been selected from a longer list with the help o f the framework
summarized above. Table 5 summarizes the resulting overall framework o f assistance by
each pillar and by grouping programs into core development and advocacy programs (see
Annex 5). Programs are listed under the heading o f the strategic goal underlying the
program.

91. The choice o f core programs reflects the basic storyline of the CPS: financial
assistance will be concentrated in areas where there i s strong government ownership
and demonstrated capacity to implement. This is the case in public infrastructure and,
as demonstrated by the successful dialogue o n fiscal stabilization and the creation of a
State Treasury, in the management o f public finances. In other areas, either government
ownership or capacity to implement smoothly along a clearly defined reform path,
remains to be fully developed. The specific activities planned over the next two years, as
explained below, reflect and substantiate the allocation proposed here. Most investment
lending i s concentrated in the core programs, while AAA activities feature prominently in
both development and advocacy programs.

92. In addition to the ten programs identified in Table 5, two additional programs
are listed as cross-sectoral at the bottom o f the table. The improvement o f governance
i s a core corporate strategy for the WBG and this is reflected across the design of all
l3Please note, as per discussion in Annex 5, paragraph 3, that “Promotion o f Innovation and Knowledge
Economy” and “Deepening Financial Markets and Reducing Financial Risks” under Pillar 1 w i l l be
considered core programs for IFC and utilize a range o f instruments, including investment lending.

activities in the CPS. B o x 6 summarizes the operational approach to governance in the
CPS. Details are provided in Annex 2. In collaboration with the IMF, the World Bank
will continues to exercise close macroeconomic surveillance and provide assistance as
required to maintain Ukraine’s solid macroeconomic record o f recent years.

93.
Several ongoing activities are not captured by the selection of programs
made but are integrated under other program headings. The Bank’s work in support
o f land reform and agricultural competitiveness has been included under the heading of
improved business climate and promoting innovation and knowledge economy. The
latter also includes advisory work, on-the-jobs agenda and skill upgrading. The Bank’s
support for judicial reform i s part o f the governance agenda, although this CPS i s careful
not to commit to ambitious outcomes in this area, given the lack o f a clear political
consensus.
D.

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES BY PILLAR

Pillar 1: Sustaining Growth and Improving Competitiveness

94.

T h e first pillar of the CPS brings together a diverse menu of interventions to
improve Ukraine’s international competitiveness. The basic underlying theme i s that
to sustain growth, Ukraine needs to move from extensive growth, relying o n cheap labor,
the existing asset base and a commodity dependent structure o f production and exports,
towards intensive growth, based o n improvements in labor productivity and growing
export diversification. The key driver o f this change i s likely to be the growth in
competition, through W T O accession,, improvements in the business environment,
improved management o f SOEs, and deepening financial markets to facilitate domestic
entry and business growth. However, additional supporting measures by the state are
required. These concern first and foremost improvements in infrastructure, in particular
improvements in energy efficiency and in transport infrastructure, to reduce costs. In
addition, the state must support economic diversification through policies that facilitate
product and process innovation and technology adoption and that ensure a sufficient
supply o f skilled labor to make technological upgrading feasible. K e y outcomes
supported by the first pillar include GDP growth above 5.5 percent per annum, labor
productivity growth in industry above 8 percent per annum, and growing export
diversification.

95. In support of the transition from extensive to intensive growth the CPS
gradually reorients frnancial and analytical support. Table 6 below shows the
transition from themes o f the previous CAS to the emerging new areas o f support. I t also
relates these to the main long-term development results targeted by the first pillar. The
diagnostic and analytical basis for the existing extensive growth agenda were developed
in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 2004 and the Trade Study o f 2005, as
well as in a series o f sector notes, in particular in the energy sector. The analytical basis
for the forward looking agenda i s yet to be fully articulated and a strong AAA investment
i s thus planned in the new CPS.

33

96. I n support o f this broad agenda, new investment lending operations in PYO8 and
FYO9 are planned in the transport and energy sector. A Road Rehabilitation and
Safety project (the k e y component o f which i s the rehabilitation o f the Kyiv-Kharkiv
highway) for US$400 m i l l i o n i s under preparation for FY08.
A further road
transportation investment is under consideration for FY09 with financing in the range o f
US$200-400 million. Both projects are expected to contribute to reduced transportation
costs, as well as improvements in road safety. A Power Transmission project (US$200
million) was approved in early FY08. Additional investments in Ukraine’s power
generation and transmission system are planned in the range o f US$200-300 million. The
investments in the power sector are linked to a programmatic engagement, which aims to
increase reliability o f supply and reduce costs through greater competition, support
growing integration o f the energy sector with Europe, and create the conditions for
increased private investment through improved financial sustainability. Investment
requirements at the municipal level and in the context o f the European Football
Championships in 2012 are also potential candidates for WBG financing in FY09 or in
future years o f the CPS.
97. Policy reforms in support of improvements in the business climate, in the
financial regulation, in the financial sustainability o f the energy sector, and in the
attraction of private investment into infrastructure, are supported by the DPL
program. D P L 11, under preparation, supports prior actions in the area o f trade
liberalization, the liberalization o f the telecommunications sector, the adoption o f a new
inspections law, the restructuring o f energy debts, and the reduction in quasi-fiscal
deficits in the energy sector. Future benchmarks and triggers in the D P L program
support the reform o f standards and technical procedures in compliance with EU
regulations (thus directly supporting the negotiation o f a FTA with the EU), the adoption
o f public private partnership (PPP) legislation to attract private investment in transport
and other infrastructure sectors, the adoption o f a new Joint Stock Company Law, the
move towards consolidated and risk-based supervision for banks and non-bank financial
institutions, continued efforts to raise energy prices and maintain collections in the face
o f import price shocks, and the enactment o f a law making the energy regulator
independent. Both loans are expected to be in the US$300-500 m i l l i o n range.
98. Improvements in governance are mainstreamed into pillar 1 activities. A
planned Judicial Support project (FY08 - US$40 million) focuses o n improvements in
the physical condition o f court houses and on the establishment o f automated case
management systems. While it i s not expected to contribute to major reforms in the
judicial sector, it m a y provide a basis to intensify the dialogue on judicial reform once
greater political consensus has been established. This would be a k e y contribution to
greater investor confidence. At the same time, a number o f demand-side initiatives under
the G A C agenda are planned. This includes the dissemination o f the Faces o f Corruption
Report in Ukraine and application to the Ukrainian reality. A key governance agenda i s
the management o f SOEs. Subsidies and non-transparent management practices are
distorting competition, creating significant quasi-fiscal losses and overall reducing

34

Ukraine’s competitiveness. While the Bank would l i k e to see privatization advance, this
may not be possible in the absence o f a broader political consensus. Against this
background, the management o f SOEs becomes all the more important and would be
expected to be an area o f engagement through both DPLs and non-lending.

99. Increasing energy efficiency i s also a key goal f r o m the perspective of reducing
carbon emissions, in the light of increased global attention to climate change. The
Bank’s current and forthcoming carbon funds, including the new Carbon Partnership
Facility will look for opportunities to support emission reductions under the Kyoto
protocol, Article 6, through the Joint Implementation framework, and Article 17, through
the International Emissions Trading framework, as well as any future agreements on
climate change. Because o f its initially highly energy inefficient structure o f production,
Ukraine i s one o f the largest potential beneficiaries o f international emissions trading,
and the resulting revenues could potentially make a k e y contribution to modernizing
Ukraine’s economy.
100. The objectives o f the pillar are also supported by a substantial portfolio o f
existing projects in the power sector, in the financial sector and in land reform. A
Second Export Development project i s a follow-up operation providing credits to
Ukrainian exporters through the banking system. In parallel, the Access to Financial
Services project provides credit lines to Ukrainian banks to reach smaller borrowers, in
particular, in rural areas and among smaller municipalities, as w e l l as providing technical
assistance t o the non-bank financial regulator. A Rural Land Titling and Cadastre
Development project is ongoing to assist in the creation o f a competitive market for
agricultural land and a State Tax Service Modernization project aims to reduce the costs
o f compliance for tax payers and thus improve the business environment.

Box 6: Operational Approach to Governance in the CPS
Weak governance and widespread corruption pose a serious developmental challenge for
Ukraine. However an internal review o f the degree o f vulnerability o f the Bank’s portfolio to the
country’s fiduciary r i s k s has found that these can be mitigated to acceptable project levels.
Three broad strategic recommendations follow: (i)
The World Bank response to the G A C
challenge must remain pragmatic and gradualist until new opportunities emerge; (ii)
given the
current implementation and institutional obstacles, as well as the lack o f a broad-based political
consensus, national-level governance reforms need to be addressed through efforts to strengthen
the demand for good governance in addition to standard investment lending instruments; (iii)
the
G A C agenda should be implemented as cross-cutting themes through the WBG’s policy lending
platform, and as design and implementation features in the investment operations for
infrastructure and public service delivery.
These strategic recommendations have the following operational implications for the WBG’s
engagement in Ukraine:

1) Adjustment o f the portfolio in the short- to medium-term towards capacity building o f civil
society and local stakeholders. The Bank will aim to scale-up successful pilots l l k e the People ’s
Voice project and develop further the synergies with other sectors (housing, utilities, etc.). The
Bank will propose new institution-building loans to the central government beyond those already
in the pipeline only when it judges prospects for successful implementation are reasonable, with
reference in the f i r s t instance to needed improvements o f existing lending interventions in t h i s
area.
2) A significant amount o f resources will be allocated to non-lending activities. The purpose of
this work will be to strengthen and broaden demand for good governance. Among the vehicles to
support this objective will be the tailoring to Ukraine’s context and dissemination of reports
distilling international policy lessons, as the recent ‘‘Many Faces of Corruption”, as well as
continuing work with NGOs and civil society.
3) The Bank will intensify i t s work with local governments, which are seen in some areas as more
effective counterparts. Given that most government-provided public goods are delivered at the
local level, such an approach may deliver results faster and propagate itself through
demonstration effects.
4) The Bank will intensify efforts to move towards SWAPSand disbursements through the budget
as a means to increase the effectiveness and efficiency o f its assistance. As implied by PEFA
indicators, disbursing through the budget in Ukraine appears to be relatively l o w risk and may
generate benefits o f greater country ownership, more efficient processing and ultimately deliver
results more effectively. However, developing a roadmap toward this approach will require
significant additional effort to strengthen strategic planning capacity in partner ministries and to
align World Bank and country processes.
5) To mitigate fiduciary risks in Bank operations, the strategy envisions strengthening existing
fiduciary standards, such as enforcing the Bank’s procurement rules, competitive bidding, as well
as adequate supervision and attention to capacity building among project counterparts.
Innovative ways to track money flows and build accountability mechanisms into project design
such as Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, stakeholder involvement in project governance or
independent technical audits will need to be explored o n a case-by-case basis taking into account
resource constraints and the need to avoid adding additional complexity to project design in the
Ukrainian context.

36

101. Under the first pillar, IFC will continue to invest directly in the real and
financial sectors and provide a range of advisory services. IFC would contribute to
the first pillar through direct investments targeting higher value added sectors as well as
sectors that require improvements in energy efficiency and overall modernization o f
production, such as manufacturing and services, agribusiness, and associated
development of logistics, freight, and warehousing industry. I F C would also contribute
to upgrading the companies’ managerial and corporate governance practices through i t s
advisory services on an individual company basis, where needed, and through a planned
Comprehensive Advisory project o n company internal controls. I F C would support the
development o f the financial sector by both investing in local banks and supporting the
entry o f regional players into the Ukrainian market, with a particular focus o n such
priority areas as energy efficiency, mortgage, SME, leasing, insurance and consumer
finance.
I F C would seek to develop innovative financing instruments that are
commensurate with clients’ needs and those o f the market as a whole, including potential
support for securitizations, provision o f partial credit guarantees and local currency
financing. Advisory work in the financial sector would promote the standardization o f
housing finance practices across the industry, develop energy efficiency finance, and
establish a framework for the development o f agro-insurance. Additional support for the
development o f agribusiness would be provided through linkages programs for
agribusiness supply chains. I F C i s also looking to engage in pilot PPP transactions in a
variety o f areas and potentially assist in the post-privatization restructuring o f the energy
sector (subject to this being done transparently). I F C would expand i t s provision o f subsovereign financing in Ukraine to address the development needs o n municipal level and
potentially contribute to the development of financial markets. T h i s will include work o n
new financial instruments, including local currency financing.
102. MIGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of
political risk guarantees. MIGA would support projects in the manufacturing and
agribusiness sectors which promote the modernization o f production and contribute to the
diversification o f the economy. Also, MIGA would contribute to the development o f the
financial sector by continuing to support foreign strategic investors. In particular, MIGA
intends to focus o n investments which: i)improve SMEs’ access to finance, ii)increase
the provision o f specialized banking products, including leasing and mortgage financing,
and iii)strengthen banks’ capitalization. The Agency would also explore opportunities to
support capital markets transactions in Ukraine, including asset-backed securitizations.
Further areas for potential involvement in Ukraine include the infrastructure and power
sectors. MIGA could also play a role in promoting foreign direct investment in
infrastructure at the sub-sovereign level.
103. Substantial non-lending assistance will complement financial support to the
first pillar. Ukraine’s competitiveness agenda will be developed under a new flagship
C E M to be delivered in FY09, but with earlier dedicated inputs on the Knowledge
Economy (Knowledge Economy Note and Assessment FY08) and Labor Markets and
Skills (Labor Market Policy Note FY08, TA and dialogue o n skills FY08). Additional
diagnostic work i s planned in F Y 0 9 in infrastructure, with policy notes o n the coal sector

37

and o n the development o f a gas market. A Trade and Transport Facilitation audit
(funded under a Trust Fund from the Dutch government) i s also planned in FY09, which
would lead to the establishment o f a performance measurement system along key transit
routes during the same year. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (F-SAP) update,
completed in 2007, takes stock o f the remaining vulnerabilities and development
challenges in Ukraine’s financial sector.
104. Significant technical assistance and advocacy work i s planned to further
improve the business climate. The IFC’s Business Environment project (FY07-1 l),
under the Private Enterprise Partnership, will take a leading role in advising the
government o n necessary changes in business regulations, including in the important
areas o f certification, permits and licensing and inspections reform. In addition, the
World Bank Institute (WBI), in collaboration with FIAS, will carry out a training
program for public officials on selected topics in promoting innovation and investment in
Ukraine. This will include detailed policy advice in the areas o f PPPs, the design and
implementation o f investment promotion regimes, including special economic zones.
105. The Bank’s regional studies and flagship reports will also contribute to the
policy dialogue in support of the first pillar. K e y reports in the coming year are the
E C A Productivity Study to be disseminated in FY08, the W o r l d Development Report
(WDR) o n Agriculture (FY08), and the BEEPS planned in 2008.

Pillar 2: Public Finance, Public Sector Reform and Improved Service Delivery
106. The Bank has in the past attempted to improve public services through
selected investment operations with individual line ministries. This approach has
delivered mixed results at best, as the underlying financial and structural problems have
not been resolved and insufficient drive and momentum from the M o F and other central
government agencies has slowed down implementation.
107. In reflection of this past experience, the CPS proposes a shift in approach in
support of the second pillar - using the reform of public finance as an entry point
for the improvement o f public service delivery. The aim i s to use the ownership o f the
MoF behind the agenda o f improving public financial management and increasing the
efficiency o f spending to structure a dialogue around changes in incentives,
accountability frameworks and budgeting processes at the line ministry and local
government level, without which improvements in service delivery will be difficult. In
parallel with this central strategic orientation, the Bank will strengthen i t s AAA activities
to stimulate demand for greater local accountability, encourage bottom-up initiatives, and
advocate the need for structural changes in the delivery o f public services, including a
reduced role for top-down state control.

38

108. The second pillar supports the achievement of the following long-term
development results:
Reduced overall size o f the government sector.
Reduced tax burden and improved tax compliance.
Increased public capital spending, and greater alignment o f public capital
spending with strategic priorities.
Improved social sector outcomes through increased efficiency o f social sector
spending.
Reduced environmental and health risks and increased social awareness o f these
risks.
Increased citizen satisfaction with the quality o f public services.
Improved employment prospects, reduced poverty and improved targeting o f
social assistance.

109. Unlike in pillar 1, where investment lending accounts for a large proportion of
the targeted CPS outcomes, in pillar 2, more emphasis i s laid upon non-lending
engagement and the results of the adjustment program. Maintaining high quality in
the policy dialogue in this critical area is therefore a pre-eminent challenge for this CPS.
110. New investment loans in the pipeline for FYO8 and FYO9 in support of the
second pillar include at the core a Public Finance Modernization project (PFM,
US$50 million, FYO8). The P F M project i s a k e y to the construction o f the second pillar,
since it will contribute to improve information systems across the entire P F M sector,
including the MoF, internal audit and the Treasury, with associated l i n k s to the State Tax
Administration and the State Customs service. This will facilitate budget preparation and
execution. Moreover, a significant technical assistance component is planned to improve
medium-term budgeting, debt management, and strategic planning. The project has been
closely coordinated with a large group o f donors providing additional technical
assistance. A Dutch Trust Fund is being mobilized to support improvements in capital
budgeting, including a large-scale training effort supported by WBI. In addition, Bank
technical and advisory services will continue in the context o f the Public Finance Review
and follow-on fiscal work.

111. Additional new investment lending will be provided for the Social Insurance
Administration project (SLAP, US$113 m i l l i o n FY09). This project lays the foundation
for a more efficient administration o f social insurance by unifying the current four social
insurance funds under the auspices o f the State Pension Fund. The project would also lay
the foundation for the introduction o f a second pillar to the pension system planned for
2009. The project i s closely linked with the Social Assistance Modernization project
(SAMP, approved FY06) which aims to reduce the cost o f administrating social
assistance.

39

112. The objectives of these investment loans are complemented and supported b y
the DPL program. The D P L I1 includes prior actions in the improvement o f public
financial management related to the overall fiscal envelope, the approval o f a public
financial management strategy, the management o f SOEs, and the introduction o f an
independent testing system for secondary education (Trends in International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMMS). Future triggers and benchmarks relate to improvements in
tax administration, inter-governmental fiscal relations, greater accountability and
transparency o f the state-owned enterprise sector, parametric changes to the pension
system to improve its financial sustainability and creating the legal basis for the
unification o f social insurance contributions. There is therefore a close link between the
core investment lending operations planned in support o f the second pillar and the
conditionality o f the DPL in this area, In addition, the D P L supports changes in input
norms in the health and education sectors, which would be key catalysts to improve
financing and introduce greater incentives for efficiency in these t w o social sectors.
113. The Bank has been increasing i t s financing support to the modernization of
municipal infrastructure with the approval in early F Y O S of a US$140 million
U r b a n Infrastructure project. This project aims to support investments into the
rehabilitation o f municipal utilities through a financing umbrella. Additional investments
with a similar construction (Municipal or Infrastructure Financing Fund) are planned in
future years. However, a key challenge in this area i s h o w t o ensure that top-down
allocations o f financial support are consistent with and support bottom-up initiatives to
improve municipal and housing services through the formation o f housing associations
and other citizen initiatives. There is also a great need to strengthen strategic planning
capacities at the level o f municipal and oblast authorities, which future projects at the
local level will need to address. An important pilot in demand-side initiatives in this area
i s the People’s Voice project funded through a Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA) grant, expiring at the end o f 2007. A follow-on initiative i s planned, and
the Bank will allocate non-lending resources to support this work. Going forward, the
objective i s to bring bottom-up initiatives together with the financial support the Bank
can provide through the central government. I F C i s also planning support in this area
through investments in PPPs at the municipal level and through i t s support to widen
municipal access to financing. MIGA may also help promote foreign direct investment in
infrastructure at the sub-sovereign level through the provision o f guarantees. The WBG
will collectively seek ways to expand the range o f instruments it can offer to
municipalities, including guarantees, local currency funding, pooled funding facilities etc.
The advice o f the Bank’s Treasury Department will be sought in this endeavor.
114. I n the health sector, the CPS proposes a shift towards greater emphasis on
advocacy to increase awareness of public health risks on the one hand, and a
gradual move towards targeted budget support on the other. The existing portfolio
includes a TB and HIV/AIDS Control project, which has faced significant difficulties in
implementation, without apparently contributing so far to reducing the rate of HIV
infections (greater success has been met by the aim to combat TB among the prison
population). Public awareness o f health risks from communicable diseases to lifestyle

40

and environment health risks i s developing slowly, and hence demand for fundamental
changes in the health care system is low. Most people seem to expect improvements
largely as the result o f more public spending. The CPS proposes to attack this challenge
from two fronts. On the one hand, a significant increase in non-lending and advocacy
work is targeted t o increase public awareness and to contribute t o a public debate about
the state o f health care and associated demographic and economic costs. On the other
hand, using the undisbursed balance o f the TB and HIV/AIDS Control project as a pilot,
the Bank will attempt to move towards targeted budget support in the health sector. Bank
financing would go through the budget and be directly linked t o government funding for
the H I V / A I D S action plan. Disbursements could be tied to performance measures,
thereby piloting the move towards SWAPSin the social sectors. T o make this possible,
significant additional technical work by the Bank’s Human Development, Fiduciary and
Public Sector Reform teams will be needed to develop corresponding procedures.
115. In the area of protecting the environment, the Bank’s approach will combine
advocacy work to highlight the economic and social costs of industrial pollution with
advisory services to support emission reductions and allow Ukraine to benefit from
carbon trading opportunities. In an innovative activity, the Bank initiated a local
environmental TA in the city o f Zaporizhzhia to work o n a local environmental risk
management plan together with businesses, representatives o f c i v i l society, the media and
the local administration. This model i s intended to be expanded to other cities and
potentially scaled up at the national level. In addition, the Bank will continue advisory
work to ensure that Ukraine benefits to the maximum extent from the opportunities under
the Kyoto protocol and any future international agreement o n climate change to sell
emission reductions and create an incentive for reduced industrial pollution.

116. In the education sector, the existing investment operation will continue to a i m
for improved access to quality secondary education. In addition, working with other
donors and WBI o n training o f education policy makers, the Bank will focus i t s policy
dialogue o n the importance o f reforming national standards and independent attestation to
improve the quality o f education. No new investment loans are planned in this area for
the time being, taking into consideration the substantial funds already allocated to the
sector.
117. T h e lending and non-lending activities for FYO8 and FY09 are summarized in
Table 7. Activities in future CPS years will be reviewed o n a rolling basis and confirmed
at the time o f the CPS Progress Report (PR) at the end o f FY09.
E. RESULTS, MONITORING
AND EVALUATION
118. T h e ultimate success o f the Bank’s strategy in Ukraine must be measured
against the economic outcomes or results achieved. Ukraine has in the past tended to
perform well o n macroeconomic results, even if crucial policy milestones were delayed.
At the same time, the extent to which this can be attributed to the Bank’s or other donors’
presence in Ukraine i s difficult to fully ascertain. The C A S C R points out that the results

41

framework in the previous CAS did not take sufficient account o f the investment lending
portfolio. It also points out that in many cases, the monitoring and evaluation
frameworks for individual lending operations need strengthening.

119. This CPS includes a results matrix (Annex 7), which will serve as the main
accountability framework during implementation. The matrix l i n k s the WBG lending
and non-lending activities to specific economic outcomes, and specifies target values for
each outcome. These are then related to longer-term country level outcomes and to the
obstacles that need to be overcome to meet these outcomes. There i s a close
correspondence between these obstacles and the analysis o f development challenges in
Section I11and Annex 1 and 2 o f the CPS.

120. The matrix emphasizes that in key areas, the main results are expected to come
from the implementation of the existing portfolio. Hence, continued attention to
improvements in portfolio performance will be critical to achieving the target CPS
outcomes. The greater selectivity o f the CPS i s expected to free up resources to help
increase the impact o f the existing portfolio - for instance by working o n the public
financial management agenda and thereby increasing attention o f spending inefficiencies
in the social sectors.
121. The need to remain flexible imposes modesty on the results framework. The
Bank, in several instances, may not be able to commit more than improvements in
selected enterprises or sub-sectors. This i s especially true for I F C investments, which
although intended t o generate demonstration effects, cannot quantify such effects ex ante.
The strong emphasis o n non-lending support also creates a challenge for the results
framework, although the cross-sectoral D P L program allows in many instances to link
key diagnostics with policy reforms supported by policy-based lending.
122. Weaknesses remain in the monitoring and evaluation frameworks of existing
projects and some changes will be necessary to align them more closely with the
CPS. Moreover, capacity for monitoring and evaluation i s weak, both in the central and
line ministries. T o support capacity building for monitoring and evaluation, the Bank can
draw o n one existing lending operation (STATCAP) and plans to apply for an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant.

F. CONSULTATION
PROCESS
123. The Bank team has conducted a series o f consultations with different
stakeholders on the design of the CPS. The basic principles o f the CPS were presented
to the authorities at the CPPR in March 2007, and the present draft was extensively
discussed and reviewed with the authorities. Roundtable discussions were held in Kyiv
during M a y and October 2007, with donors and with c i v i l society, and the full CPS draft
was posted o n the Bank’s external website for three weeks in September-October 2007.
The Bank also presented the same material to representatives o f all major political parties
and conducted five regional consultations in Donetsk, Kharkiv, Lviv and Lutsk and
Simferopol. In addition, the Bank team held informal discussions o n different economic
and political development scenarios and the role o f the international community with a
group o f independent political analysts.
124. The consultation process held to date has confirmed significant support for the
Bank’s approach. In particular, participants endorsed the principle o f greater selectivity
in the Bank’s interventions. The greater emphasis o n infrastructure lending in the
portfolio going forward was supported by other donors, although the Bank was requested
not to abandon the social and institutional reform agendas. In response, the Bank
clarified that i t would change the m i x o f instruments but not the degree o f engagement o n
social and institutional reforms and emphasized the importance o f close donor
collaboration in achieving impact f i o m its non-lending interventions. Representatives of

44

c i v i l society raised concern about governance and corruption in Ukraine and highlighted
that there was some disillusionment with the reform process, which they felt had not
translated into sufficient improvements in living standards and in the quality o f service
delivery. Civil society representatives strongly endorsed the emphasis in the CPS o n
stimulating demand for improved governance and urged the Bank to establish a forum
and a platform for greater national debate o n reform priorities, NGOs expressed great
interest to widen their collaboration with the Bank in the implementation o f the CPS and
some expressed a view that the CPS should adopt the strengthening o f civil society as a
key objective in i t s o w n right. The independent political analysts cautioned that
improvements in governance may continue to be slow given strong vested interests, and
argued for a pragmatic approach that failed to raise unrealistic expectations. There was
general agreement that financial support to the government, through lending operations,
was most effective in areas where a national consensus o n the need for reform had been
reached.

125. Consultations with representatives from different political parties confirmed
that there i s no fundamental difference in economic vision and the commitment to
reform. All those consulted welcomed the Bank’s continued engagement to support
economic reform in Ukraine and felt the principles established by the CPS were adequate.
A review o f sectoral priorities also did not reveal major differences o f opinion in relation
to areas o f focus for the Bank. A detailed summary o f the consultation process held to
date i s in Annex 8.
VI. RISKS A N D R I S K MITIGATION
A. IMPLEMENTATION
RISKS

126. Implementation risks in Ukraine are considerable. The track record of
implementation, particularly in the investment lending portfolio, is poor. Ukraine has the
lowest disbursement rates among any IBRD borrower, although there have been some
significant recent improvements.

127. The main sources of implementation risk fall into three categories: (i)lack of
ownership, (ii)cumbersome internal procedures which are inconsistent with W o r l d
Bank procedures, and (E)policy delays or reversals.
128. Ownership: The capacity o f Ukraine’s government for strategic planning remains
relatively weak.
The authorities have been making efforts to improve internal
coordination, but strategic prioritization remains a challenge. In this environment, it is
sometimes difficult to ascertain the extent o f client ownership for a particular
intervention. Yet, the Bank has in the past also been culpable o f preparing lending
operations at the request o f line ministries, without verifymg the extent o f support (and or
political resistance) by power brokers in the central government agencies (Cabinet o f
Ministers, MoF, Ministry o f Economy).

45

129. The current CPS imposes greater limits o n the number o f new projects being
prepared, thereby forcing the authorities to coordinate more effectively. This has already
been in evidence in preparation o f the CPS, when the Government internally agreed to a
clear sequence for the preparation and approval o f three institutional reform projects in
the lending pipeline:
Court Modernization, P F M Reform and Social Insurance
Administration Modernization. In addition, the Government clarified that they would not
consider asking for support for c i v i l service reform until 2010, which i s consistent with
Bank staff evaluation that the political consensus to push forward c i v i l service reform
does not yet exist. The recent improvements in coordination with W o r l d Bank assistance
by the authorities are part o f a general effort, as reflected in the elaboration o f a
Government Strategy for Cooperation with IFIs, adopted in 2006.
130. The CPS also aims for greater ownership o f the AAA work and the planned
Innovation Fund would be the strongest expression o f a new partnership where client codetermination o f the focus areas for Bank advisory services would result in greater
impact.

13 1. Cumbersome procedures: Ukraine has a bewildering array o f internal procedures
and every step in project preparation requires a consultative inter-ministerial process that
can last several months. Moreover, IF1 projects with the exception o f the DPL, are not
included in the annual budget and hence each project requires ratification by the Rada,
which again delays project effectiveness by several months.
132. The Bank and the government have started a dialogue o n simplifying national
procedures and moving towards the use o f country systems on a selected basis, where
fiduciary risks are thought to be manageable. A s an initial success o f this dialogue, the
government recently passed a resolution mandating the disbursement o f World Bank
funds through the National Treasury. Moreover, the 2007 CPPR has committed both
sides to clear service standards in portfolio monitoring and implementation (Box 7). An
improvement in the disbursement rate t o 12 percent and general portfolio performance
standards are base case conditions o f the CPS.
133. Policy delays or reversals: The pace o f policy reform in Ukraine has by and large
fallen short o f expectations. This has affected the sequence o f DPLs, which have tended
to take at least two years to prepare. The annual disbursement schedule foreseen in the
CPS may thus be regarded as ambitious.
134. The risk i s mitigated at least in part by a recalibration o f the D P L program.
Compared to close to 100 benchmarks and over 20 triggers in the P A L 2 program, D P L I1
contains only 8 prior actions and six triggers. Moreover, the D P L fiamework i s flexible;
triggers can be waived if reform progress i s delayed in one area, but this i s compensated
by greater progress in another area. The recalibration of the D P L program i s reflected in
the smaller share that adjustment lending takes in the overall CPS envelope, and in the
smaller size o f each D P L relative to the size o f the budget or the economy. Thus while
the economy has tripled in size in U S dollar terms since 2000, the average D P L size of

46

US$300-400 m i l l i o n i s not much higher than the average size o f previous adjustment
operations.

135. Delays in the implementation o f k e y legislation can also affect the preparation
schedule o f investment lending operations. To the extent possible, the D P L should
shoulder this risk by taking on policy conditionality important to deliver investment
lending results. However, in some cases, a legislative change i s a pre-condition for an
investment operation to be feasible. In such cases, a careful political economy analysis
will need to be conducted to understand the risks associated with this policy
conditionality and the preparation schedule may have to be adjusted or the project
abandoned.
Box 7: Portfolio Monitoring and Implementation: Agreed Services Standards
In March 30, 2007, the representatives o f the Ukraine central government agencies and the World Bank
liscussed the proposed new draft CPS for FY2008-2011 that w i l l be based on new principles and
ipproaches in cooperation as well as the World Bank project portfolio in Ukraine.

:he meeting reviewed the status o f the lending portfolio and agreed o n the need to improve its
ierformance. In order to achieve greater results o f the Bank-financed Investment projects, the parties will
nake every effort to apply to the investment projects the following performance standards:
From commencement o f work (decision o f the Government on the expediency o f a project) to signing the
minutes o f formal negotiations - 1 year; If there i s a delay in such Government's decision, the two sides
should discuss and decide whether there i s a necessity in project preparation;

The Ukrainian side w i l l facilitate the international project agreements to become effective within 6
months after their signing;
Projects under implementation but with insufficient implementation progress, and whose objectives are at
risk o f not being met, will be subject to consideration with regard to their restructuring, extension andor
closure by mutual agreement, without prejudice to the rights o f either side to make decisions individually
within the framework o f respective international project agreements.
2uarterly portfolio performance review meetings w i l l be convened by the Ukrainian side and the Bank
vhich will allow all project implementing entities and project implementing units involved in World Bank
irograms to discuss project implementation. The Government and Bank management w i l l meet at more
enior levels as appropriate to discuss systemic or urgent matters.
ireview o f progress in the Bank's CPS and the overall performance o f the Bank's programs will be held
luring an annual Country Program Review. The World Bank, working closely with the Cabinet of
llinisters and relevant ministries, will develop program- and project-level results indicators that w i l l be
nonitored and assessed as part o f the Country Program Review.

'he parties w i l l apply a systems approach to the country project portfolio, starting with the use o f the State
'reasury to service all investment projects executed by the central governmental bodies and other
budgetary agencies, which are approved by the World Bank after July 1, 2007 (World Bank's fiscal year
,008). In those cases when Special Accounts are s t i l l needed, such accounts will be opened exclusively in
he local commercial banks or NBU.
'he parties will continue to optimize the procedures and shorten the period o f processing documents by
loth the World Bank and corresponding central government agencies.

136. F i d u c i a r y risks a r e another i m p o r t a n t source o f risk f o r the CPS. However,
several recent diagnostic pieces allow the conclusion that these risks are manageable and
the standard assistance mode through the central government remains a viable model for

47

Ukraine. An internal review o f corruption risks was carried out in 2006 to analyze
governance problems in Ukraine and h o w they affected fiduciary risks in the portfolio.
This analysis came to the conclusion that although fiduciary risks in Ukraine were
recognized to be higher o n all important dimensions than in the EU accession countries or
other large middle income borrowers, in practice, fiduciary controls in investment
lending operations worked to acceptable standards. The Governance Annex (Annex 2) o f
the CPS explains h o w the Bank intends to go beyond standard fiduciary controls in
addressing governance risks, although it should be acknowledged that additional demand
side measures are likely t o take some time to take effect and will be applied initially o n a
selected basis. Stronger fiduciary controls, as developed in the context o f the Bank’s
GAC, will additionally be required.

137. The PEFA assessment revealed significant strengths in budget execution,
credibility and transparency. These achievements are encouraging and suggest that the
Bank should over time move to disbursing financial assistance through the government
budget. However, the PEFA assessment also highlights weaknesses in the capital budget
and in the state procurement system. These t w o weaknesses should therefore be at the
center o f the Bank’s efforts to move towards a greater reliance o n country systems as an
explicit risk mitigation strategy.
B. CREDITRISKS

138. Ukraine’s public sector debt levels are low and the country’s macro economy
at present i s reasonably balanced. Section I1 provided an analysis o f Ukraine’s recent
growth and macroeconomic performance and highlighted Ukraine’s considerable
macroeconomic strengths and good fundamentals.
139. Nonetheless, several important macroeconomic risks exist, which will need to be
carefully monitored in terms o f their implications for Ukraine’s overall creditworthiness.
The main r i s k s from a macroeconomic perspective include:
Adverse terms o f trade shock: With metal prices at record highs, the impact
o f rising energy import costs has been muted. Should this change, Ukraine
would face widening current account deficit, reduced corporate profitability,
and at least temporarily lower growth.
Reduced access to international financing: Ukraine has benefited from a
benign external environment in terms o f both export prices and access to
financing.
Should portfolio preferences shift against emerging markets,
Ukraine would be vulnerable both because o f the reliance o n external financing
o f i t s current account deficit, and perhaps more importantly, because o f
potential impacts on domestic financial sector liquidity. Liquid domestic assets
are well in excess o f scheduled private debt repayments, but a sharp curtailment
o f liquidity could expose underlying credit risks in the financial sector.
Rapid financial sector expansion and remaining weaknesses in regulation.
While banking sector supervision has improved, there i s s t i l l need for further

48

capacity building and greater transparency in the management o f banking sector
risks. In the non-banking sector, which has experienced fast growth from a l o w
base, regulation remains very weak. This could exacerbate risks should a
tightening o f liquidity or an unexpected sharp exchange rate devaluation expose
underlying credit quality issues.
Fiscal expansion driven by populist politics: Fiscal management t o date has
been conservative, but political instability has led t o election promises that if
fulfilled could be fiscally costly. Fiscal expansion would risk overheating the
economy, with further rises in inflation, growing external imbalances and the
potential risk o f a hard landing.

140. The above macroeconomic risks are mitigated by Ukraine’s past record of
macro-management, which suggests policy will adjust in the face of negative shocks.
Specifically, it i s likely that in the face o f strong negative terms o f trade shock, the
exchange rate would adjust, and fiscal policy would support the economic rebalancing.
Should external conditions deteriorate more gradually, the NBU would have time to
move towards a more flexible exchange rate regime, which i t has indicated it will do over
the medium-term. Ukraine’s experience at the end o f the 1990s has moreover engrained
a strong commitment to fiscal stability and aversion to too much dependence o n external
financing. Nonetheless, continued vigilance will be required to monitor Ukraine’s
macroeconomic balance and any possible impact o n creditworthiness o f large adverse
external shocks.

49

ANNEX 1: KEY DEVELOPMENT C H A L L E N G E S
A. SUSTAINING GROWTH
AND IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS
1. Ukraine needs to move up the value chain to gain market share in Europe and
other developed markets and reduce the exposure to terms of trade shocks
stemming from i t s current reliance on commodity-based exports. Ukraine’s exports
are concentrated in metallurgy, chemicals and food products. The share o f intermediate
inputs in the production o f these products i s high and their prices tend to be volatile in
international markets. The challenge i s to adopt new technologies, and improve the
quality o f products, all the more so, since Ukraine’s wage cost advantage i s likely to
erode in coming years. Ukraine produces a relatively high number o f patents and has a
well developed research and development capacity, but it fails to turn this capacity into a
significant stream o f product or process innovations at the enterprise level. The country
i s weakly integrated into global production chains because o f l o w levels o f FDI. Despite
high enrollment rates, university graduates struggle to find adequate jobs, while skill
shortages in manufacturing are increasing, as many skilled workers have sought
employment in Russia and Western Europe.
2. A variety of indicators highlight that much remains to be done to improve the
business climate. T h e World Bank’s Doing Business indicators in 2006 ranked Ukraine
128th out o f 175fh, with key weaknesses in the tax system, the protection o f property
rights and bankruptcy procedures. The OECD recently produced an index of product
market regulation - an indicator that captures the degree to which markets operate fi-ee
from state intervention and create conditions conducive to business development (Table
A1 .1). While considerable progress has been made in the regulation o f entry, the scope
o f government intervention remains very large. Ukraine must improve at fostering the
survival and expansion o f private businesses to generate the competitive dynamics that
would stimulate greater innovation and foster sustained productivity growth. The
continued dominance o f state-owned enterprises or companies with close connections t o
government officials in key markets i s one obstacle to greater competition. Although
survey evidence strongly suggests that privatization increases firm level productivity, the
privatization process has been effectively stalled in recent years. Corporate governance
practices also fall well short o f international standards, the antiquated company law dates
back to 1991, while contradictions between the c i v i l and commercial codes create vast
scope for discretion in the interpretation o f the legal fi-amework for private contracts and
property rights.

3.
The financial sector has undergone an important transformation over the
past two years with the aggressive entry of foreign strategic investors, but s t i l l
requires stronger regulation. Total banking sector assets have increased more than five
times since 2000 and with bank credit to GDP standing at close to 50 percent, Ukraine i s
catching up with the countries in Eastern Europe. Table 5 shows that this expansion has
happened at the same time as interest margins have come down and bank profitability has
increased, pointing t o the beneficial impact o f growing competition. However, the
financial sector faces important challenges. Regulation o f banks and in particular o f nonbank financial institutions, i s still weak and not risk-based; the disclosure o f ultimate
beneficial owners i s not mandatory for either banks, security issuers or non-bank
financial institutions; and the capacity o f the three financial market regulators needs
~trengthening’~. Moreover, loan books are not yet mature and the rapid pace o f
expansion i s likely t o hide underlying problems. Maturity mismatches and growing
foreign exchange exposure to unhedged households are concerns”.
Moreover, the
strengthening o f regulations o f non-bank financial institutions and o f the securities
markets are key conditions for the success o f a second pillar pension reform, currently
planned for 200916.

4.
A key step forward in structural reform have been recent legislative changes
(at the end of 2006 and again in June 2007) laying the foundations for the accession
to the WTO. With i t s accession to the W T O expected over the coming months, Ukraine
would lock in important advances in structural reform and accept important rules
concerning future policy, including:
0
Bind the import tariff reductions that it carried out during 2005-2007;
0
0

Reform o f customs procedures;
A l l o w foreign banks to establish branches in Ukraine, thereby further enhancing
competition in the banking sector;

l4See the Programmatic Technical Assistance Partnership (PTAP) position paper on the development o f
capital markets, World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), 2007.
These findings are echoed by a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Updated currently under
preparation.

51

Gradually reduce (or phase out) export duties o n scrap metal and selected
agricultural products;

0

Gradually shift the mode o f agricultural support from input and production
subsidies (“amber and yellow box”) to measures supporting agricultural
competitiveness, the environment and rural development (“green box”); this
includes changes to the VAT regime in agriculture which would considerably
reduce current tax expenditures in the sector;
Accept limits o n the kinds o f investment support trade-related investment
measures (TRIMS) that would be acceptable, including in the context o f setting
up special economic zone;
Accept a much stronger regime for the protection o f intellectual property rights
trade-related aspects o f intellectual property rights (TRIPS);
Reform i t s standardization, licensing and labeling regime to continue the
harmonization o f Ukrainian standards with International and European norms and
remove any discrimination against importers;
Adhere to the General Agreement o n Tariffs and Trade (GATT’s) Art. 24 in
joining any regional free trade area.

5.
In parallel with the WTO accession process, the telecommunications market has
been liberalized, penetration rates for mobile phones and the internet have increased
dramatically, and tariff rates have begun to converge to European levels.

6.
However, even after WTO accession, Ukraine will need efforts to reduce
behind the border obstacles to trade and modernize i t s transport and logistics
system to fully benefit from the opportunities of international integration. A recent
comparative exercise ranks Ukraine 73rd out o f 150 countries in terms o f the quality o f
i t s transport and logistics. The assessment shows that Ukraine lags i t s peers in the areas
o f customs, the quality o f transport infrastructure, the ease o f shipment and ease o f
tracking, and the quality o f logistics services. Timeliness and internal logistics costs are
rated more favorably (Figures A l . l and A1.2). Major physical investments will be
needed to improve the situation. Ukraine has passed a concessions law that lays the basis
for PPPs in the transport sector, but this framework remains untested and a
comprehensive law o n PPPs i s under preparation. The state-owned railways has also
embarked on a multi-year restructuring program that foresees corporatization, tariff
rebalancing and gradual disinvestment o f non-core assets over the next five years.

T h e initial adjustment to the hike in gas i m p o r t prices has been encouraging,
but reforms need to continue to attract private investment, improve the efficiency o f
the energy sector, and exploit the opportunities for greater energy trade with
Europe. Despite import prices rising by 53 percent, the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy
sector actually fell as a percent o f GDP in 2006, as a result o f strong domestic price
adjustment. Collection rates have declined in 2007 as expected, and m a y f a l l short o f the
levels achieved in 2005-2006. Ukraine's industrial sector has reacted to the price
increase by significantly increasing investment in energy saving, one o f the factors
behind the revival o f investment demand in 2006. W h i l e financial discipline in the sector
has been progressively strengthened, inherited debts are starting t o b e reduced, and
progress in transparency has been made with the move to cash purchases for gas and

53

auctions for power exports, and an ambitious reform agenda remains: Ukraine needs to
strengthen the independence of the energy regulator, persist with tariff adjustment, relaunch privatization in power distribution and create the conditions for the operation o f a
domestic wholesale market. Moreover, the coal sector urgently needs to be restructured
and privatized and greater transparency i s required in the gas sector. These reforms carry
significant political sensitivities and thus the pace o f their implementation is likely to
continue to be carefully sequenced.

B. PUBLIC FINANCE,
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM AND IMPROVED PUBLIC SERVICE
DELIVERY

8.
The tax burden i s high, tax administration i s cumbersome, and the structure
of taxation remains unbalanced. Tax compliance costs are high as reflected in a very
l o w ranking on the Doing Business Indicator for paying taxes, as well as in surveys o f
domestic enterprises, such as the annual I F C S M E (Table Al.3). The lack o f a risk-based
approach to tax administration imposes a high burden o f inspections o n all tax payers,
bona fide or not. The performance o f the VAT suffers on the one hand from a lack o f
control over fraudulent VAT registrants and o n the other from wide-spread arrears o n
VAT refunds for exporters that act as a significant tax o n foreign trade and as a source for
corruption. Significant scope for tax avoidance is provided by the simplified tax system,
introduced in 2003, while new tax expenditures in the form o f various investment
promotion schemes currently under preparation raise additional concerns 17. The current
government has been working o n a new Tax Code that would consolidate existing
legislation and that contains a number o f improvements but i t s future has been put in
doubt by the current political uncertainty.

half o f the total capital budget is accounted for by subsidies and transfers to SOEs o f
doubtful efficiency. N e t o f such transfers, public investment barely exceeded 2 percent
of GDP in recent years, just h a l f o f the level in the EU accession countries, and between
three and five times lower than public investment in the fast growing middle income
countries o f East Asia (Figure A3).

10.

While capital spending i s low and i t s strategic prioritization i s weak, other
elements of public financial management have undergone important improvements.
A recent PEFA report highlights recent progress, in particular, in the area o f budget
credibility and execution, comprehensiveness and transparency, and accounting and
reporting (Figure A4). The creation o f a treasury and i t s integration within the MoF, as
well as the incorporation o f all extra-budgetary funds into the national budget, were key
milestones in this respect. Ukraine also has a functioning and reasonably independent
external audit institution, the Chamber o f Accounts, which prepares regular and public
reports o n public spending. However, revenue and performance audits are not yet
common and internal audits, in particular within individual spending units, remains
underdeveloped. K e y additional weaknesses pointed out by the PEFA report relate t o
strategic planning and prioritization, the capital budget process, the management and
control o f SOEs, and the quality o f the public procurement system. The latter
experienced an important setback over the course o f the previous CAS which i s
summarized in Box 4.

T h e 2001 reform of the Budget Code transferred responsibility for the
management of social assets and the delivery o f most public services, including
health and education, as well as municipal utilities, to the local government level.
However, the tax system remained essentially centralized, and thus a formula based block
grant was instituted to equalize financial resources across regions. This reform in
principle laid the foundation for decentralizing accountability for service delivery to the
local government level.
12.
However, overlapping responsibilities and the complexity o f the intergovernmental financing formula have partially offset the potential positive impact o f this

reform. Ukraine has 24 oblasts, 2 cities with special status, 1 autonomous republic, 490
rayons and around 30,000 rural towns and settlements. The lowest o f these levels is
responsible for the delivery o f basic services, with some higher level responsibilities
located at the rayon level. But in many cases, responsibilities are overlapping.
Moreover, the formula determining the size o f the inter-regional equalization transfers
has grown more and more complex over time, reducing transparency and re-introducing
the scope for negotiation and discretion in the determination o f transfers. The lack o f
year-to-year predictability weakens incentives for multi-year planning and can result in
unfunded mandates.

13.

Rigid input norms have also limited financial and managerial autonomy in
public service delivery at the local level. In both health and education, service
providers are regulated by centrally imposed input norms, such as specific staff/student or
personnel/patient ratios, or the constitutional prohibition against the closure o f health
facilities. These input norms conflict with the formula-based approach to financing, but
take precedence, such that capital and operational maintenance budgets need to be
correspondingly adjusted. This undermines any incentives for cost savings and strategic
planning and leads to chronic under-spending o n non-wage costs at the local level. K e y
reforms, such as the move from in to out-patient and from secondary to primary care in
the health sector, are impossible without a revision o f these rigid input norms. The unit
costs o f service delivery are high, while staff motivation is l o w given l o w salaries (due to
overstaffing) and lack o f real autonomy.

An increasingly urgent priority for reform i s the housing and utilities sector.
14.
Most o f Ukraine’s housing stock i s old and in a state o f serious disrepair. The same i s
true for municipal utilities. Technical and commercial losses are considerable, while
inadequate tariffs undermine the utilities’ financial sustainability and incentives for
improved demand management. Few meters are installed, except for electric power. The
problems o f deteriorating housing and utility infrastructure are related. While most o f the
apartments were privatized during the 199Os, the housing stock itself typically remains in
municipal ownership. Municipalities contract with a public service monopoly (the socalled “Zheks”) to maintain buildings and undertake critical repairs. In the absence o f
competition, service standards are low, while apartment owners are provided with few
incentives to look after communally-owned assets. In this situation, the increases in
municipal tariffs for gas, district heating and water naturally meet strong resistance by
households, who have little opportunity to save consumption without improvements in
the state o f communally-owned infrastructure and the installation o f meters. Perhaps
equally if not more importantly, the sad state o f the sector is a cause o f significant health
risks due to l o w water quality and failing heating supply in winter, and at the same time a
cost t o business due to the unreliability o f supplies.

Ukraine suffers from serious environmental and public health risks but
people’s awareness of these risks remains low. Ukraine’s l i f e expectancy at birth has
remained stagnant through the process o f economic recovery at 62 years for men and 74
years for women. These numbers are around 11 years and 7 years below averages in
developed European countries and, for men, significantly below the average for MICs.
Ukraine suffers from high levels o f male mortality in particular, caused by increases in
cardiovascular diseases and external causes o f death (injury, accidents, and poisoning).
Industrial pollution, as well as stress and unhealthy lifestyles (including tobacco and
alcohol abuse), are chief causes o f high levels o f mortality. The costs o f pollution related
mortality and morbidity in Ukraine have been estimated at UAH 13 billion (around 2.5
percent o f GDP).” Moreover, Ukraine suffers from one o f the fastest rates o f increase o f
HIV/AIDS infections in Europe, while Tuberculosis (TB) i s also a significant concern.
The population has a relatively negative perception o f the quality o f treatment received in
the health sector (according to the L i f e in Transition Survey, 38 percent o f respondents
are either very unsatisfied or unsatisfied, compared to 25 percent in EU member states
and 33 percent in the CIS MICs. However, awareness o f public health risks i s s t i l l l o w
and improvements in Ukraine’s health status will require efforts to increase demand for
better protection from, and policy attention to, issues o f public health risks.

16.

The social insurance and assistance system i s poorly targeted and not
financially sustainable. While social assistance and, in particular, the PAYG pension
system has been successfwl in contributing to reduced poverty in recent years (see Section
I),
the targeting o f this assistance to the poor has been very weak. In 2005, around 35
percent o f all social transfers, including pensions, were received by households which
were not in the bottom t w o quintiles o f the distribution (Table A4). While in the case o f
pensions, at least 45 percent o f all payments were received by households in the bottom

quintile, in the case o f gas or housing subsidies, this percentage amounted to only 14 and
9 percent respectively. In other words, these two transfer payments were strongly
regressive. As argued further above, Ukraine could easily afford to compensate the poor
for the recent increase in energy prices and thus mitigate the social costs o f moving
towards cost recovery and financial sustainability in the energy and municipal utilities
sector. However, this would require reforming social assistance payments to improve
targeting. An important initial step has been the unification o f social assistance claims
into one application and the creation o f a unified database o f all social assistance
claimants. K e y reform challenges in the pension system are summarized in Box A1 .

BOX Al.1: K E Y CHALLENGES IN PENSION REFORM

Like many other countries in the region, Ukraine has a P A Y G pension system with several problematic features.
The Ukrainian system features a conventionally defined benefit formula with generous replacement rates, l o w
retirement ages (60 for men and 55 for women), the full old-age pension entitlement based on 20 years of service
for women and 25 years for men, and numerous early retirement provisions. H i g h contribution rates to finance
this system and caps imposed on maximum pensions to keep the system in balance have discouraged compliance
and led to almost flat benefits. In 2004, significant increases in the minimum pension hiked pension spending
from 9 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 15 percent in 2005 and the resulting pension hnd deficit, reached 3.3 percent
of GDP. Since then, parametric adjustments and a conservative indexation formula have reduced pension fund
spending and closed the deficit. Compliance, as measured by the share o f contributions collected from the
declared wage bill, has also improved. Nonetheless, the P A Y G system remains inefficient (due to incentives to
under-declare incomes), unfair (due to negative rates o f return for contributors over the long run- replacement
rates are expected to fall from the presently 45 percent to 27 percent in the long run, while the contribution rate
for wage earners i s 34 percent) and unsustainable over the medium-term (due to demographic developments)
In 2003-2004, a series o f legislation was passed introducing a multi-pillar pension system, with a mandatory fully
funded second pillar. However, introduction o f the second pillar has been delayed because o f a provision that it
can only be introduced if the first pillar i s in full balance. Specific arrangements, including contribution rates into
the second pillar, administrative issues, financing o f the transitional deficit, and the timing o f the reform, remain
to be clarified by additional legislation (the corresponding L a w “On Implementation o f Cumulative System of
Obligatory State Pension Insurance” was passed in first reading in April 2007). One concern i s that the Ukrainian
capital markets may not be strongly developed enough to absorb a large inflow o f pension fund investments. This
requires improvements in the regulation o f capital markets and increases in the supply o f low-risk domestic
government bonds in parallel with preparations for the introduction o f a second pillar. The government has also
reduced the planned rate for mandatory second pillar contributions to 2 percent, which will limit initial inflows
into the system.
In addition to ensuring the conditions for a successful introduction o f a multi-pillar pension system are in place,
Government faces the additional challenge to introduce parametric changes to the P A Y G system to ensure i t s
financial sustainability over the long-term and re-establish a connection between contributions and benefits to
improve fairness and compliance. Key World Bank recommendations include: (a) increase in retirement age for
women, (b) reduction o f eligibility for minimum pension for working pensioners, (c) better minimum pension
targeting, (d) differentiation o f the minimum pension level, (e) introduction o f regular contribution rates for those
on simplified tax regime, and (0 reduction in early retirement provisions. Implementation o f these measures
would provide the opportunity for a moderate reduction in the contribution rate and a more generous indexation
pattern in latter years. The Government foresees a gradual and sequenced approach to these reforms in parallel
with the introduction o f a multi-pillar system

ANNEX 2: GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTIONAGENDA

1. Executive Summary
1. T h i s annex takes stock o f Ukraine’s progress on governance and anticorruption,
formulates strategic recommendations, and draws operational implications for the Bank’s
engagement in Ukraine.

2. Extensive analytic work done in Ukraine by the World Bank and other development
agencies concludes that corruption poses a major developmental challenge for Ukraine.

Risks to the appropriate use o f Bank resource transfers are among the highest in the
region, but are also capable o f being mitigated.
3. In order to strengthen country outcomes in the area o f GAC, the Bank’s strategic
engagement will be guided by the following principles in the context o f i t s new CPS: (i)
The Bank response to the G A C challenge must remain pragmatic and gradualist, linked to
the emergence o f country-owned initiatives; (ii)
given the obstacles experienced by the
Bank in the implementation of institution-building investments, as well as the lack o f a
broad-based political consensus around G A C reforms, addressing national-level
governance reforms through full-fledged investment lending is, under present
circumstances, unlikely to deliver results; (iii)the G A C agenda should instead be
implemented as a cross-cutting theme through the WBG’s policy lending platform, and as
design and implementation features in the investment operations for infrastructure and
public service delivery.

4. These have the following operational implications for the Bank’s engagement in
Ukraine:

(i) Adjustment o f the portfolio in the short- to medium-term towards capacity
building of civil society and local stakeholders. The Bank will aim t o scale-up
successful pilots l i k e the People ’s Voice project and develop further the synergies
with other sectors (housing, utilities, etc.). The Bank will propose new institutionbuilding loans to the central government beyond those already in the pipeline only
when it judges prospects for successful implementation are reasonable; with
reference in the first instance to needed improvements o f existing lending
interventions in this area.

(ii) A significant amount o f resources will be allocated to non-lending activities. The
purpose o f this work will be to strengthen and broaden demand for good
governance. Among the vehicles to support this objective will be the tailoring to
Ukraine’s context and dissemination o f reports distilling international policy
lessons, as the recent “Many Faces of Corruption” as well as continuing work with
NGOs and civil society.

(iii)The Bank will intensify its work with local governments, which are seen in some
areas as more effective counterparts. Given that most government-provided public
goods are delivered at the local level, such an approach may deliver results faster
and propagate itself through demonstration effects.

60

The Bank will intensify efforts to move towards SWAPS and disbursements through
the budget as a means to increase the effectiveness and efficiency o f i t s assistance.

As implied by PEFA indicators, disbursing through the budget in Ukraine appears
to be a relatively l o w risk and may generate benefits o f greater country ownership,
more efficient processing and ultimately deliver results more effectively. However,
developing a roadmap toward this approach will require significant additional effort
to strengthen strategic planning capacity in partner ministries and to align World
Bank and country processes.
T o mitigate fiduciary risks in Bank operations, the strategy envisions strengthening
existing fiduciary standards, such as enforcing the Bank’s procurement rules,
competitive bidding, as well as adequate supervision and attention to capacity
building among project counterparts. Innovative ways to track money flows and
build accountability mechanisms into project design such as Public Expenditure
Tracking Surveys (PETS), stakeholder involvement in project governance or
independent technical audits will need to be explored o n a case-by-case basis taking
into account resource constraints and the need to avoid adding additional
complexity to project design in the Ukrainian context.

2. Governance and Anti-Corruption Challenges In Ukraine
(a) Governance as a Developmental Challenge

5. Ukraine has seen noticeable improvements in governance over time. The greater
degree o f political competition, improvements in government legitimacy and the
functioning o f basic checks and balances lay behind these improvements. However, not
all o f these improvements have been sustained, suggesting that some o f the
measurements recorded in 2005 may have been due to the initial high expectations o f
positive change in the aftermath o f the events that came to be known as the “Orange
Revolution”.
6. Nonetheless, the process of improving governance has been gradual rather than
radical even after 2004 and the results have been very uneven. While progress was
made in several areas o f government policy, including macroeconomic and public
financial management, and in the degree o f transparency and accountability o f the public
sector, improvements have been more limited in creating strong public institutions,
including a functioning and independent judiciary, and a meritocratic and efficient civil
service (see also C A S CR, Annex 3). As a result, such improvements have not translated
into notable development outcomes in areas such as the business environment or the
delivery o f public services, Overall, the quality o f governance s t i l l poses a major
developmental challenge.

7. Citizens desire anti-corruption reform from the state at high levels, but
personally are willing to do little to combat the status quo and uproot petty
corruption. The relatively slow and uneven improvements in governance since the
“Orange Revolution” have left an expectations gap with regard to the accountability o f

61

elected officials.” Politicians are seen as corrupt and disrespectful to the rule o f law;
legislators’ allegiance i s seen as mainly to their parties, and not to those who elect them;
civil servants, including judicial officials, are perceived to be self-serving, corruptible and
unaccountable to public interest. There is widespread cynicism and disrespect for public
office and public goods. Despite improved regulatory quality, the regulation o f the
private sector i s not perceived to be for public interest, or government policy to reflect
broad-based public preferences; the Government is distrusted as a public agent and i s
regarded as captured by the big domestic business groups.

8. While all the main political forces stress their commitment to fight corruption,
their incentives to undertake the political and institutional changes that would lead
to a radical improvement are more limited. Vested interests within the bureaucracy
but also among the domestic business groups are strong. These interest groups m a y
support the G A C agenda if it plays to their advantage (e.g., in access to international
capital markets), but have in the past resisted faster institutional changes. Therefore, a
continued gradual, muddle-through scenario i s considered most likely. Against this
background, the Bank’s G A C activities should not rely exclusively o n high profile topdown interventions, but should also seek to strengthen the demand for good governance
fi-om below.

(8) Dimensions of Governance and Anti-Corruption and Policy Initiatives
9. A comparison across dimensions o f governance reveals that Ukraine lags in
particular in the areas of control of corruption, the rule of law and the degree o f
political stability. By comparing the weight o f governance concerns in various existing
governance datasets2’, the areas which emerge as the highest priority for Ukraine are
control o f corruption, establishing property rights and enforcing contacts, and legal and
judicial reforms, followed measures to safeguard independence o f the media, public
administration and civil service reform, and further improvement o f the quality o f public
financial management (see Table A2.1).

19

Survey results o n people’s t r u s t in public institutions can be found in the Life in Transition Survey,
carried out jointly by EBRD and the World Bank. The Bank also commissioned a background analysis o f
recent public opinion surveys prior to preparation o f the CPS, on which the observations here draw.
2o A detailed comparison for Ukraine was conducted using World Bank Institute Governance Indicators,
Freedom House, Corruption Perceptions Index - Transparency International and Business Environment
and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) indicators.

(c) Public Sector Governance Assessment

14. The governance of Ukraine’s public sector i s hampered by limited capacity for
strategic planning, overlapping and extensive administrative functions, the lack of a
de-politicized, professional civil service, and constitutional ambiguities that have
contributed to repeated political crises. Ukraine’s bureaucracy i s large and the public
sector consumes almost h a l f o f official GDP. While Ukraine has maintained, through the
painful transition process a relatively strong state and capable bureaucracy, it has so far
failed to modernize most public institutions in line with the requirements o f a market
economy (with some notable exceptions such as the NBU). The c i v i l service i s poorly
remunerated, appointments are not always made o n a meritocratic basis, and frequent
changes in senior positions have hampered planning and policy-making. While key
public services are delivered at the local level, the framework for local government
autonomy and accountability is weak and implementation o f central policy decisions
uneven.
15. Despite overall institutional weaknesses, Ukraine’s public sector boasts some
notable strengths.
In particular, Ukrainian public financial management
institutions compare favorably with those of regional and lower middle-income
peers.23 The budget i s comprehensive and credibly executed, it i s adequately discussed
and reviewed by parliament, cash management i s strong and fiscal risks are o n the whole
managed well. Weaknesses relate to the control o f implicit fiscal risks in the nonbudgetary public sector, including SOEs, the management o f payroll, the auditing o f
revenues, and crucially, the management o f public procurement. In addition, the
government’s capacity for medium term budget planning, including prioritization o f
public investments, and the integration o f the budget into a medium-term macroeconomic
framework are under-developed. The coordination and management o f donor assistance
i s poor.
16. Centralized internal financial control i s adequately functioning in the present
public administration; however, it does not yet meet EU standards. At present, two
central institutions are involved in internal financial control: the State Treasury o f
Ukraine (STU) and the State Control and Revision Office (KRU). The STU carries out
ex-ante control and ongoing controls o n cash payments. These controls often do not
guarantee sufficient financial discipline and there are s t i l l many breaches o f laws and
regulations. The system does not stimulate managerial responsibility and annually the
KRU can only cover one-third o f the total number o f state budget entities.

17. External audit in Ukraine generally meets the requirements of international
standards, in particular with regard to independence and audit remit. For ten years
since it was established, the Accounting Chamber o f Ukraine (ACU) has achieved
substantial progress in all aspects o f i t s activity, in spite o f the difficult operational
environment. However, further reform will require transforming the role o f the body
from a controlling to a financial management one. This will require strong political
support at senior government level in a manner that will also assure i t s continued
independence from the executive.
23

See Public Financial Management Performance (PEFA) report, 2006.

65

18. A particular concern in the government’s fiduciary framework i s the
procurement system. As described in detail in the World Bank’s recent CPAR (2006),
following legal amendments in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the public procurement system has
become fragmented, beset by conflicts o f interest, and lacks oversight by the central
government. New legal amendments have been drafted to address the concerns raised
collectively by the donor community, but not yet adopted by the parliament.
3. GAC in the Bank Program and Fiduciary R i s k s Mitigation
(a) The Bank’s Governance and Institutional Reform Effort

19. The limited effectiveness of past interventions to help address the GAC agenda,
through assistance for institution-building, requires a recalibration of the Bank’s
approach.
The previous two CASs addressed key development constraintsinstitutional weaknesses and poor governance-and
were consistent with the
government’s objective^.^^ The Bank’s diagnosis about the centrality o f the governance
and institutional reforms was accurate and valid. The Bank’s effort reflected a broad
agenda, supporting the demand and supply side o f governance simultaneously, including
strengthening civil society and improving accountability and transparency o f the
government. Progress has been slower than expected, partially because efforts to build
new institutions take time, but also because the government’s willingness and
commitment to deliver faster progress in this area were overestimated.
20. This suggests that the Bank’s institution-building efforts should begin by
improving the implementation of existing lending operations and increasing the use
of non-lending instruments to build greater demand for improved governance. The
current portfolio in this area includes a State Tax Modernization project, and a Statistical
Development project, as well as a Public Finance Management project and a Judicial
Support project under preparation. In addition, there is one active operation and one
under preparation to reform the institutions providing social assistance and security in
Ukraine.
21. T h e progress achieved in public finance management to date may provide an
entry point for public sector reform and improved governance. The Bank program
supported significant P F M reform to improve budget operations and i t s outcomes have
been recognized as positive. Modern budgetary institutions and practices (treasury,
budget code) were established and the Bank’s effectiveness has benefited from the steady
relations with the MoF.
22. Building on these achievements, the second pillar of the current CPS i s built
around the theme o f Strengthening Public Finance. This builds o n key analytical
reports such as the CEM, a C F A A and CPAR (2006), the PEFA report (2006), and PFR
(2006). These reports provided policy recommendations on public sector governance that
were incorporated in subsequent lending operations. For example, PFR and the Public
Financial Management project under preparation will assist the Government o f Ukraine
24

Their consistent themes were: (i)
achieving sustainable economic growth and integration into the world
economy; (ii)
restructuring the public sector, and achieving improved transparency and accountability;
and (iii)
poverty reduction, comprehensive human development, and reduction o f regional imbalances.

The analysis confirmed that o n

anticorruption infrastructure,
Ukraine compares unfavorably with the new EU members and with the group o f large
middle-income countries, while compared to other CIS countries, Ukraine compared
favorably.
24. The Bank declared misprocurement only once, back in 1999, and one case has been
recently referred to the Department o f Institutional Integrity. Procurement post-reviews
have mostly revealed relatively minor issues. Some projects are judged to be more
vulnerable to corruption, and irregularities found in two projects appear to stem from bad
management rather than fraudulent intent. The relatively strong performance of
Ukraine’s public financial management in recent studies suggests that i t i s appropriate for
the Bank to continue the process o f increasingly aligning i t s project implementation
arrangements with country systems, provided those areas identified as weak are
addressed, and additional capacity i s deployed in selected areas. The policy reversals in
public procurement noted elsewhere in this report will prevent the Bank f r o m significant
use o f country procurement systems for the time being. As a risk mitigation measure,
all high risk projects identified by the fiduciary team will be subject to a joint
fiduciary review (Le., FM together with procurement and disbursement) once
during the lifetime of the project.
25. The Bank has supported the design of an internal control system, and i s
providing assistance to the G o U in redesigning the role o f the two agencies with an
external control mandate (the Accounting Chamber and the KRU) consistent with
accepted EU principles. The challenge is to move beyond compliance t o performance
audits, which will require improvements in the government’s internal monitoring and
evaluation framework and in strategic planning capacity.
Recognizing that
implementation i s k e y for developing such capacity, the Bank will invite the Accounting
67

Chamber to conduct performance reviews o n selected Bank financed projects during the
period o f implementation o f the new CPS.

26. Additional efforts to improve fiduciary controls at t h e country level are needed,
with a focus on public procurement, the governance and management o f stateowned enterprises, and in strategic planning and capital budgeting. The 2006 PFR
identified major constrains to proper capital budgeting in Ukraine. The Bank has been
increasingly emphasizing, as a strategic objective the building o f domestic ownership and
reducing transaction costs by a gradual integration o f i t s projects into country systems.
However, to do so effectively will require advances in public fiduciary controls as well as
the planning and execution o f the public investment.

27. The B a n k w i l l continue to strengthen the assessment o f procurement r i s k s
earlier in the project preparation cycle and mainstream participatory oversight in
t h e procurement processes (see section 4(a) below); however, i t s longer-term goal will
remain working with the Government and other donors o n improving the national
procurement system. This effort will be directed at meeting the internationally
recognized standards for efficiency and transparency such as adopted by the Baseline
Indicators Tool.25

4. Bank’s GAC agenda for Ukraine and Entry Points for 2008-2011
28. The overarching objective o f t h e Ukraine country GAC activities w i l l b e to assist
in developing institutions - national and local - which function on a participatory,
fair, transparent, accountable, and efficient basis. The immediate objective i s
formulated to underpin and strengthen the implementation o f the CPS (FY08 to FYI 1)
aiming t o sustaining high economic growth, improve competitiveness, public sector
reform and service delivery.
29.The main points o f e n t r y w i l l b e through further enhancement o f country
systems in particular public financial management, integration o f GAC in sectoral
projects and programs, and through strengthening of the anticorruption measures
in project design. Specifically, the Bank’s engagement o n the three levels - project,
sector and country - will be as follows:
(a) Project Level: Mainstreaming Project Anti-Corruption Plans

O n a project level, the G A C work will focus o n improved fiduciary controls in line
with the corporate G A C agenda; pilots o n using communications to address governance
concerns; and exploring new accountability mechanisms in project design and
implementation.

Improving existing fiduciary controls will begin by identifying each project’s main
vulnerabilities to corruption overall and separately for each major component. An
improved management review process for fiduciary risks within the E C A Region will be
25 E.g. see the World Bank / OECD D A C procurement initiative adopted by the “Johannesburg
Declaration” in 2004 and the 2006 OECDIDAC Benchmarking Tool under development which provides
the methodology for application o f the baseline indicators and associated compliance and performance
indicators.

68

applied. A Fiduciary Committee established at the level o f the country team a year ago
will continue to address fiduciary risks and concerns. Additional training will be
provided t o the staff o f implementing agencies. Opportunities will be sought where
appropriate for more detailed anti-corruption activities focused o n better standards, code
of conduct, improved financial management, transparency, and enhanced public
oversight. These activities will include greater transparency and accountability through
the publication o f project reports, and the active engagement o f c i v i l society and
community members.
N e w accountability mechanisms may include representatives o f civil society groups
attending public bid openings and contract signings; inviting c i v i l society observers from
local universities or other independent institutions; technical assistance to NGOs for
monitoring government anti-corruption efforts; or establishing a working group to
oversee progress o f the anti-corruption reforms. Moreover, the Bank will explore
strategic cooperation opportunities between project teams and EXT for the use o f
communication as an essential tool o f increasing transparency on the use o f Bank
delivered resources. An example o f innovative community monitoring mechanisms
which could be adapted to World Bank lending operations i s the People’s Voice project,
active in currently six cities in Ukraine (Box A2.1).

(b) Sector Level: A Focus on Risks and Opportunities for GAC in Infrastructure
Existing analytic work shows that the sources and nature of corruption differ b y
sector. Bank engagement will therefore be adapted to respond to each sector’s GAC
environment. In the area o f public service delivery, this will include local accountability
mechanisms, as appropriate. Pilot programs are planned o n advocacy work in health,
housing and environment, which could be also expanded to education in later CPS years.
Governance risks in infrastructure deserve particular attention, since the bulk of
additional lending during the CPS period i s planned in this sector.26 Corruption in
infrastructure and related services i s reported o n all levels, from meter readers, paying
extra for connections to jump a queue, to a “10-percent-rule” at ministerial level (grand
corruption). Corruption in infrastructure affects negatively the quality and cost of
infrastructure services; the public is robbed by being charged for l o w quality or nondelivered services or services i t does not need. In addition to collusion among bidders,
infrastructure projects are especially vulnerable t o change order schemes and the use of
inadequate and inferior materials. Efforts to mobilize private financing for the major new
construction projects may lead to collusion between private investors and government
officials and non-competitive solutions, adoption o f overly optimistic demand
projections, and the assumption o f excessive commercial risks by public entities.
Construction licenses and permits are among the biggest sources o f local-level corruption

The most common causes for the high incidence o f corruption in infrastructure are: (a) the scale o f the
fixed investments required; (b) procurement o f large contracts procurement; (c) the presence o f natural and
artificial monopolies generating large rents; (d) the management o f large equipment and civil works
contracts by government agencies (licenses, permits and registration requirements); and (e) fixed
investments vulnerable to expropriation.

BOX A2.1: PEOPLE’S VOICE PROJECT

The People’s Voice project i s a technical assistance project (funded by the Canadian
government) that has supported the facilitation o f citizen engagement activities in six cities in
Ukraine (Makiyivka, Chernihiv, Komsomolsk, Lutsk, Alchevsk and Kolomyya) with a focus
o n municipal governance and civil society development. The main thrust o f the project has
been to improve local service delivery by building the capacity o f municipal officials to
identify solutions to local problems that are identified through “citizen report cards”. The
project has sought to develop standards, procedures, structures, and s k i l l s o f local partners
through the facilitation o f a series o f project activities (training, regional workshops, research,
etc.) so that municipalities can become economically self-sufficient and so that various citizen
engagement mechanisms can be sustained over time, including:
creation o f project stakeholder committees so that ideas are shared, areas o f common
interest are identified and future project planning i s agreed upon by local partners;

building o f local research capacity o f NGO partners so that they can conduct their own
research and carry out the monitoring o f service delivery;
creation o f focal points for citizen engagement, such as community foundations and
condominium associations; and
development and distribution o f best practices, in the form o f guidelines and
publications, so that methodologies can be accessed as a resource throughout the country
and replicated in other cities.
Beyond the local results associated with the citizen engagement efforts, the project has
brought about change in local service improvements, with three main themes having emerged
involving both the vertical and horizontal integration o f project activities and trends: (1)
development o f I S 0 9000 systems; (2) reforms in the communal housing sector, and (3)
modernization o f the social assistance system. Many o f these efforts are now being integrated
in national policy efforts and adapted in other Ukrainian cities.

30.
Governance risks in infrastructure deserve particular attention, since the
bulk of additional lending during the CPS period i s planned in this sector.27
Corruption in infrastructure and related services is reported o n all levels, from meter
readers, paying extra for connections to jump a queue, to a “10-percent-rule’’ at
ministerial level (grand corruption). Corruption in infrastructure affects negatively the
quality and cost o f infrastructure services; the public i s robbed by being charged for l o w

government officials and non-competitive solutions, adoption o f overly optimistic (see

Box A2.2).

Box A2.2. ADDRESSINGGAC IN INFRASTRUCTURE
Moving beyond deterring corrupt practices and towards devising preventive safeguards
and actions, by improving client’s control frameworks, accountability environment and
ensuring adequate FM system for implementation. “Ring-fencing’’ project risks i s a limited
solution - it i s needed in particular cases but often i s not sufficient to mitigate risks emerging
from institutional weakness o f project implementing agencies and the authorizing environment.
The challenge here i s to mitigate the r i s k s o f working through the country’s systems (FM,
procurement, judiciary, property rights, contract enforcement) by strengthening these systems
in the process. One o f the key lessons from the Bank infrastructure program i s that achieving
this objective critically, depends on the selection o f the project implementing agency based on
its clear commitment to technical and governance excellence, and providing support under the
project for capacity building in project management, procurement and FM.
Finding innovative solutions in applying results-focused and participatory approaches
and third party-monitoring to project preparation and implementation b y working with a
broad array of stakeholders and civil society. Engaging civic groups in social accountability
mechanisms (control and oversight) in the sectoral policy reforms in energy and transportation
and project implementation will strengthen the demand side for good governance. Lack o f
competition i s one o f the root causes o f poor governance. In infrastructure, Government i s often
the sole provider o f infrastructure services. Therefore, i t i s all the more vital to engage citizens
in the decision-making process through feedback mechanisms such as citizens report carts
(CRCs) seeking feedback o n public service quality, policy formulation, specific projects and
alternatives. Innovative infrastructure projects would aim to build-in such demand-side
feedback mechanisms and provide technical assistance. A recent example o f such collaboration
i s the preparation o f the Urban Infrastructure Project in cooperation with the People’s Voice
Project (PVP), and piloting the integration o f G A C communication actions along the entire
project cycle o f the Dniester Pump Storage project. On the supply side, encouraging the project
implementing agency and the government agency responsible for project oversight to conduct
regular public consultations on key features o f the project (including use o f funds) would go a
long way in improving transparency and encouraging openness in the dialog between project
entities and civil society.
Apply integrated analytical (e.g., governance assessments and governance outcome
assessments) and advisory approach advocating sector-wide reforms and assist the
government with replacing corruption-prone and “rent-seeking” business models b y
providing empirical evidence; complement the work to be done through the D P L series, on
establishing checks-and-balances for institutional separation o f the government’s policymaking, regulatory, and ownership functions; strengthening the financial and administrative
independence o f the regulators (e.g., NERC); establishing arms-length relationships between
the government and infrastructure service providers; strengthening competition among
suppliers and thus reducing the bribe tax; advocating rule-based, transparent regulation limiting
the discretionary power o f regulators and regulatory “capture.” A broad dissemination o f the
analysis and advice in these areas i s an important element o f rising awareness and broadening
and consolidating support for the governance and anti-corruption agenda.

71

(c) Country Level: Bridging the Expectations Gap through Advocacy Work

3 1. Addressing the expectations gap in the relationship between citizens and the
state underpins the country-level strategy for Ukraine. T o bridge this expectation
gap, the Bank at the country level will emphasize activities that generate demand for
reform.
32. A shift to supporting demand for good governance will imply adjustment of the
portfolio in the short- to medium-term towards greater emphasis on activities
supporting such demand, w i t h relatively less emphasis o n investment loans to support
supply side improvements in public sector institutions. A significant amount o f resources
will be allocated to advocacy activities, such as disseminating and tailoring Ukraine’s
environment the recent “Many Faces o f Corruption” report and continuing work with
NGOs and civil society. Advocacy will be a prominent dimension o f the CPS.

33. Given that most government-provided public goods are delivered at the local level,
opportunities will be sought to w o r k directly with reform-minded local authorities.
Such an approach is expected to deliver results, including through demonstration effects.
The Bank will use non-lending services, such as the Zaporizhzhia environmental
technical assistance or the People’s Voice project, to help build capacity at the local
government level and strengthen accountability mechanisms by working with c i v i l
society. Where possible, this will be combined with investment lending for the
upgrading o f municipal infrastructure to achieve a maximum degree o f synergy. IFC
would play a particular role as a provider o f non-guaranteed funding to local
governments and private investors, and as an advocate for enhancing private investment
opportunities by improving local governance.

34. T h e private sector i s both a victim and an instigator o f bad governance. I t plays
an essential role in the development of self-regulatory and self-policing mechanisms
to eliminate malpractice and corruption. Recognizing this role, the CPS proposes t o
intensie the dialogue with the private sector o n G A C issues, seeking to build coalitions
for reform with those representatives for whom improvements in governance make good
business sense. Indeed, the further integration o f Ukraine into the global economy and
international institutions demands compliance with high standards o f transparency and
competitive rules and regulations. The business community can be an important
advocate o f harmonizing domestic regulations with international standards, particularly
those businesses for whom these regulations are already known from their international
activities.

35. T h e Bank will seek to highlight governance shortcomings through i t s diagnostic
tools and regular business surveys. The BEEPS (scheduled to go into i t s fourth round
in 2008) and the annual I F C SME surveys, are potentially useful tools t o reach out to
business representatives and to the public at large and demonstrate the costs o f corruption
and governance weaknesses.
36. Issues for Bank’s advocacy in support of private sector GAC are: (a) further
strengthening o f different international and national initiatives promoting private sector
integrity anti-bribery preventive mechanisms; (b) work with the State Committee o n
Financial Monitoring (SCFM) o n upgrading the technical capacity o f the A M W C F T
72

Center and i t s role in the Eurasian anti-corruption network; (c) assist the private sector
with initiatives to improve the business environment - e.g. ensuring competitive
conditions for infrastructure investments, regulatory reforms, urban local governance
reforms; (d) assist the private sector with self-evaluation and reporting in the absence o f
overarching control standards -- from voluntary company code o f ethics towards setting
up integrity systems and compliance programs in accordance with international standards
and approaches2*; (e) strengthen the corporate governance in SOEs, and the
implementation o f transparent accounting standards (such as IFRSs, IPSAS). The
Accounting and Auditing ROSC29has made targeted recommendations for reform, which
will be taken forward by a National Steering Committee, led by the MoF and supported
by the Bank.

37. The Bank will continue implementation of the existing portfolio and support
policy changes through the DPL program. The Bank will support efforts to reinforce
public sector efficiency, strengthen public finance management oversight and monitoring,
improve taxation and public administration, and reduce arbitrariness o f public policy
decision-making. Sustained reform in these areas i s central for making headway in
linked areas such as competitiveness, infrastructure policy, and public service delivery.
This engagement will need to be balanced with the need to recalibrate the D P L program
to take account o f the more gradual pace o f policy change (the D P L design had
anticipated decided acceleration in governance reforms in 2005).
38. As outlined above, the B a n k will continue to provide support to strengthen the
country’s own fiduciary systems through technical assistance and regular dialogue
and support key reforms, including public internal controls, oversight, improving SA1
roles and capacity. This engagement, begun under the 2003-2007 CAS, will continue to
align implementation arrangements for Bank supported activities with Ukrainian systems
and processes. Close coordination with other donors, including importantly the European
Commission, will be a feature o f this work.

5. Donors, Partnerships and Communication

39. Donors’ assistance in relative terms i s small3’, donor leverage over the Ukrainian
institutional environment i s quite limited and donor coordination requires
improvement. Donors face a major challenge in lending support to the Government,
before the emergence o f political consensus and stable institutions. The current
fragmentation o f government agencies engaged in development activities, and uneven

E.g. Social Accountability International ( S A I ) Principles for Countering Bribery; OECD Convention on
Combating Bribery o f Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions; the I C C Rules o f
Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery and the anti-bribery provisions o f the OECD Guidelines for
Multinationals; initiatives, such as “Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative” (EITI); the “Equator
Principles”, as a baseline o n environmental and social procedures; the “Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering
Principles” as international standards to fighting money laundering in the financial services sector.
29 The Bank has recently updated the Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance o f Standards and
Codes (A&A ROSC), which assesses the statutory framework and drivers o f quality for financial reporting
in the corporate sector.
30 Currently the size o f the ODA i s less than 3% o f total government expenditures.
28

73

coordination among the donor community limit the absorption capacity o f the country
and create costly duplication and overlaps.

40. M a n y donors have adjusted their assistance to the modest pace of change and
are emphasizing advocacy, capacity building of civil society, training of public
officials and the provision for national debate3'. The Bank's G A C agenda i s aligned
with the strategic priorities o f major donors, including the European Institutions (EC,
CoE, EIB, EBRD) and the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID). Table A2.3 summarizes current donor assistance in the G A C area.

national government, judiciary, and c i v i l society assisting these actors with anticorruption campaigns or supporting initiatives by civic groups which favor increased
transparency that reduces opportunities for corrupt practices and fraud. At the same time,
the Bank will increase the transparency o f i t s o w n activities by strengthening i t s website
and general EXT program.

6. GAC Results Monitoring and Reporting

42. The GAC results are included in the CPS matrix and will be monitored together
with the achievement of other CPS results. Thereby, as the matrix o f development
outcomes in Annex 7 makes clear, GAC goals to be contributed by the CPS have been
specified modestly with an aim to measurability and realism. Ukraine’s long-tern
development objectives include the harmonization o f i t s institutional framework with best
international practices and the country’s closer integration with the EU. The achievement
o f the modest CPS goals will be one milestone o n the path towards this endeavor.

ANNEX 3: CAS COMPLETION REPORT (FWO4-07)

I.

INTRODUCTION

1. This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) takes stock o f the
effectiveness o f the FY04-FY07 Bank assistance to Ukraine and draws lessons for the
preparation o f the forthcoming CPS. The review takes a medium term look at the
program, given the high degree o f continuity between the FY00-FY03 and FY04-FY07
CASs. For the preparation o f this CR, the team has:
Examined the alignment between the CAS design and‘the stated objectives o f the
government program;
Reviewed progress towards long-term development objectives o f the country;
Reviewed progress made with Bank support in the implementation o f the
program;
Reviewed documentation;
0
Interviewed staff; and
0
Drawn lessons.
2. This report benefited from discussions with the IEG team that worked o n the Country
Assistance Evaluation (2007) and several reviews undertaken during CAS
implementation, such as the CAS Progress Report (2005), and internal staff reviews o f
investment lending performance (2005), corruption vulnerabilities (2006) and political
economy and governance (2007). I F C coverage in this report draws upon the findings o f
the IEG-IFC Country Impact Review (CIR, 2007).
11.

LONGTERMDEVELOPMENT
OUTCOMES

3. Ukraine’s long-term development outcomes during this CAS period compare
favorably with the expectations set by the government program--“European Choice
(2003). ” The CAS put forth a summary set o f indicators to assess progress in reaching
the long-term development outcomes under the “European Choice” agenda. Table 1 of
this document compares them with the results achieved.32 The comparison shows that,
despite an ambitious program, the majority o f the long-term development targets have
been met.
4. Economic growth exceeded expectations. Economic growth, at 7.8 percent per
annum from 2003-2006, exceeded the expectation o f 5 to 6 percent set under the CAS.
Deterioration in the terms o f trade and curbed investors’ confidence, brought about by a
series o f political realignments and changes o f government, slowed down economic
growth in 2005 to 2.7 percent. Since then, economic growth resumed-it was 7.1 percent
in 2006 and i s forecast by Bank staff to reach 6.5 percent in 2007. Growth is likely to be
above 5 percent for the medium term. With hindsight, observers would seem to have
consistently underestimated the potential for economic recovery and growth in Ukraine.
32 Table A3.1 corresponds to Table 3, page 18 o f the CAS. This table itself i s a summary o f a broader set o f
results expected under the government program and presented in Appendix B-9 o f the CAS.

76

Often institutional reform has been linked too tightly with short-term economic
performance. In fact, the economy had sufficient room to grow despite the slow pace o f
institutional reforms overall, while key institutional bottlenecks, such as soft budget
constraints, the barter economy, and lack o f fiscal policy credibility, were removed by the
authorities in a timely fashion.33

5. The market has rewarded the strong fiscal position of the government. The
objective to reduce external public debt was met handsomely: at 15 percent o f GDP,
public external debt is n o w below the ceiling set by the government program (40 percent
o f GDP).34 A relatively tight fiscal policy, o n average, and rapid economic growth,
helped lower the external debt burden. The grading o f sovereign paper in international
financial markets has improved. Standard and Poor’s and Fitch both rate long-term
sovereign debt o f the government at BB-. Political stability i s the main concern o f
investors today. Moody’s recently increased i t s rating to B1 from Ba3, after conducting a
thorough review o f the banking sector.35 The government has easier access to
international financial markets. For instance, it placed in June 2007 US$500 m i l l i o n
dollars in five year bonds at 6.385 percent. The tight fiscal position and the stable
exchange rate have contributed to a reduction o f inflation. Recently, however, the sharp
increases in energy prices have pushed inflation back into double digits. The level o f
international reserves stood at around US$26 billion at the end o f June 2007, which was
equivalent to around four months o f imports.
6.Thefinancial sector is stronger and deeper, although there are still risks. The growth
and deepening o f the financial sector also proceeded at a pace faster than had been
foreseen. Credit to GDP went from 26.6 percent in 2003 to 48.4 percent in 2006. The
ratio o f deposits to GDP went from 17.1 percent to 33 percent. Competition, both
domestic and foreign, has made the sector stronger. A process o f bank consolidation i s
underway. The result o f this competition has been a decrease in the in the intermediation
margins for loans in local currency (from 9.9 percent in 2003 t o 7.2 percent in 2006.)
This said, however, there are concerns that the rapid growth o f credit in the economy may
be weakening bank portfolios and that the exposure o f the banking system in foreign
currency m a y be too high. However, the high level o f international reserves provides a
cushion to manage swings in financial investment preferences.
7 . Poverty dropped rapidly over the CASperiod. There has been a significant reduction
in the poverty rate; poverty levels now stand at 8 percent o f the population, l o w by any
standards.36 In addition, in line with the government program, poverty decreased among
critical groups like the elderly and the rural population. Salaries increased by 77 percent

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY08 through FY 11 presents this point in greater detail.
I t should be noted, however, that implicit public liabilities in the pension system as well as in the socalled lost savings o f the former Soviet Sberbank are considerable, if contingent - see Public Finance
Review (2006).
35 At the beginning o f the CAS period, the Fitch rating was B+, S&P B, and Moody’s B2.
36 Ukraine: Poverty Update, World Bank Report No. 39887-UA, June 2007. This Report measures poverty
against an absolute poverty line, calculated to provide the minimum o f calories plus an allowance for nonfood goods and services.
33

34

77

during the CAS period, above expectation^.^^ The real increase in pensions was 34.8
percent in 2004 and 28.9 percent in 2005. The rapid increase in salaries combined with
increases in social transfers (pensions and assistance) largely explains the decrease in
poverty rates.
8. There have been improvements in the education system although quality remains a
concern. The coverage of pre-school education i s much broader now, although it s t i l l
lags in rural areas. In addition, enrollment and completion rates in secondary and tertiary
education are higher. Around two thirds o f the 18-21 year cohort i s enrolled in higher
education. However, the educational system does not seem to be providing either the
skills or the quality needed by the labor market. That said, there i s keen awareness that
the country needs to improve education outcomes to sustain a pattern o f high productivity
growth.
9. Progress on health has not met national expectations. The country met the targets
the CAS set on maternal and child mortality. However, l i f e expectancy has not
recuperated from the substantial drop early during the transition process and the wedge
between male and female life expectancy i s well above EU or middle income country
averages. A key concern in health and education i s the emerging gap in the quality o f
service delivery between rural and urban areas. Regretfully, the fight against TB and
AIDS incidence has stalled; and indicators have actually worsened.
10. Ukraine is more integrated into the rest of the world. The growth o f trade (both
exports and imports) exceeded GDP growth over the CAS period. The EU and the U S
have declared Ukraine a market economy, Ukraine i s close to joining the WTO, for
which goal successive governments across the political spectrum have pushed through a
sometimes controversial legislative agenda. The objective o f joining the WTO has been a
key driver in achieving institutional change. However, Ukraine has made little progress
over the CAS period in the geographic diversification o f exports. The share o f total trade
with the EU has remained roughly constant at around 30 percent between 2002 and 2005,
while Russia’s share has recently been growing thanks to buoyant demand in Russia and
rising import costs o f Russian energy supplies.
11. There have been gains in governance in selected areas, in particular, voice and
accountability and transparency. Various international rankings (WBI, TI) register these
gains, although Ukraine stills ranks l o w o n governance for i t s level o f income. The
quality o f public financial management has improved. Progress towards the intended
objective o f moving Ukrainian public institutions to European standards, however, has
been slow. Even though Ukraine ranks above the mean within the CIS community, it
falls behind countries with similar incomes elsewhere in the world.

The rapid increase in salaries was supported by a high rate o f increase in labor productivity. Still,
competitiveness as measured by unit labor costs in foreign currency has decreased.

GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGIC

GOALS
AND CAS DESIGN

12. The 2003-2007 CAS supported the government program titled “European
Choice”--a commitment to European-like institutions in Ukraine. The Bank discussed
the content o f the CAS with the government, the Parliament and with civil society. In
addition, the CAS design took account o f the lessons derived from the previous CAS.38
The 2003-2007 C A S organized expected results around the seven pillars o f the

importantly, the emphasis on the demand and supply aspects o f institution-building
continued to be at the core o f the program. On the supply side, the CAS maintained the
focus on completing the institutional set-up needed to move Ukraine towards a market
economy and to ensure the basic welfare o f the population. The CAS added emphasis o n
the move towards European levels o f institutional performance and the accession to the
WTO as important drivers for the demand for institutional change, as indeed has been the
case. I t retained the commitment to work with c i v i l society.

institutions. The move to European institutions gained credibility as the program o f the
government focused o n improving public sector governance and transparency. The Bank
prepared the CAS P R after the inauguration o f a new President and appointment o f a new
government in 2005. It introduced adjustments to the lending and AAA programs, but
broadly maintained the results structure o f the original C A S program. The WBG
supported implementation o f the government program with adjustment lending (DPL),
extensive analytical work, and dialogue.
15.
Since the CPR, the Bank has gradually realigned its mode of assistance by
increasing focus o n sector agendas in areas such as infrastructure (to reflect the Bank
Infrastructure Action Plan approved after finalization o f the CAS, with a particular
emphasis on energy and energy efficiency), public expenditure management, social
protection, and reducing industrial pollution. Support for improvements in the business
environment and the climate for attracting private investment focused on key policy
constraints whilst increasing efforts to support capacity building in the private sector as
well as in regulatory bodies (including through IFC’s technical assistance). In addition,
the Bank team has been implementing the recommendations o f an internal review o f
investment lending undertaken in 2005 and various portfolio reviews. A significant
development during the period o f the CAS is the increased engagement o f the I F C in

CAS RESULTS
ASSESSMENT

17.
This section takes stock o f the contribution o f the Bank Group to the achievement
o f expected results under each o f the seven pillars o f the CAS. The Results Matrix at the
end o f this document summarizes the results obtained with the support o f the CAS
interventions, including dialogue. The presentation here follows the seven pillars o f the
government program around which the CAS was designed.
Pillar I:Supporting macroeconomic and financial sustainability

18.

WBG support under this pillar sought to help provide solid foundations for
economic growth, combining attention to improved macroeconomic and financial
sector outcomes with priority institutional reforms. The major contribution and
results came from an improved fiscal position o f the government, greater payment
discipline in the economy and a stronger financial sector. In addition, the financial
position o f the energy sector has improved and efforts are underway to refurbish installed
capacity and increase energy efficiency. On the other hand, progress in deregulating the
economy and lessening the regulatory burden in business although positive has remained
behind expectations and Ukraine's position lags in international rankings. Similarly,
there remain widespread concerns about governance and transparency in both public and
private enterprises.
19.
Overall the positive advances made in macro-economic and financial
stabilization have created conditions for sustained economic growth and some
diversification in the structure o f production. Under these improved conditions, the
country has been able to make better use o f existing resources and has begun a process of
capital modernization, in areas like agro-industry, steel, airspace and others.39
Investment as a percentage o f GDP stood at 24 percent in 2006-above the target set by
the CAS (22.7 percent). FDI increased from slightly over US$1 billion in 2003 to over
US$5 billion in 2006. In addition, the country has been able to absorb major increases in
energy prices and to meet the challenges posed by preparing for accession to WTO.
20.
T w o adjustment operations4'
provided the framework for the policy
dialogue and supported most of the key achievements. Major AAA work supported
and complemented the policy dialogue and the design o f the adjustment operations.
Technical assistance operations, l i k e a Treasury project (completed) and a State Tax
Administration Reform project (underway), have assisted the country in building
institutions that underpin macroeconomic performance.

A forthcoming ECA Productivity Study finds that the productivity o f the Ukrainian manufacturing sector
increased by 40 percent between 2000 and 2005-half o f this increase i s accounted for by reallocation of
labor from lower to higher productivity f m s as well as the entry o f new f i r m s and exit o f old ones. The
rapid growth in productivity helped support the increases in real wages.
40 The two adjustment operations were the second operation o f the P A L series and the first o f the D P L
series.

81

2 1.
Strong private sector demand for financing under improved macroeconomic
conditions have led IFC to expand i t s operations, in particular since 2005. During
the CAS period it invested over US$680 m i l l i o n in 20 companies across seven different
industries, representing a substantial increase from just US$40 m i l l i o n in investments in
the entire decade leading up to the C A S (FY93-03). In line with priorities laid out in CAS
Progress Report, IFC’s efforts were predominantly geared towards helping promising
local companies increase their competitiveness through a m i x o f technological,
managerial and governance improvements. In particular, many o f the companies in the
agribusiness and manufacturing sectors, which jointly received 55 percent o f I F C
investments, benefited from this type o f assistance. A number o f projects also supported
the entry o f foreign companies into the Ukrainian market, helping to stimulate investor
interest through a positive demonstration effect. As was planned in the C A S under
Pillar I,IFC’s programmatic advisory services have expanded as well, focusing o n a
broad range o f corporate governance, business climate, and agribusiness development
issues.
Fiscal and Financial Discipline and Financial Sector Development

22.
The Bank adjustment agenda contributed significantly to improved fiscal
and financial discipline in the accounts of the central government. The C A S set as an
objective to help the government improve the payment discipline o f government by
eliminating the generation o f new budget and tax arrears and reducing the existing stock.
That objective has been achieved; new arrears are under control and the stock o f arrears
has been reduced gradually although not eliminated. A second objective was to help
strengthen the fiscal position of government by keeping public debt as a percentage o f
GDP to below 40 percent, A prudent fiscal stance and rapid economic growth have
reduced the ratio o f public debt to GDP to 15 percent.
23.
Since the CPR, the fiscal position of the government has strengthened
further. Privatization revenues and reduced tax expenditures (in 2005) and buoyant tax
revenues in line with higher than expected GDP growth (in 2006 and 2007) have
contributed to limit public borrowing requirements. The concern n o w i s the increasing
absorption o f resources by the public sector-with total spending at 44 percent o f GDP in
2006, the increasing share o f public consumption in total spending and the
correspondingly limited resources allocated to public investment (around 2 percent o f
GDP). Nonetheless there i s n o w strong political consensus around the importance o f
price stability, payment discipline, a tight fiscal position and reduced levels o f public
sector debt. Politicians and bureaucrats have come to see the public debt ratio as a
strategic variable in signaling the strength o f the country to the international financial
community.
The contribution o f the Bank came through the two adjustment operations
24.
and analytical work. The focus on taxation informed the dialogue o n reducing tax
expenditures and set the basis for an agenda on tax reform n o w under implementation.
The Public Finance Review (FY06) explored further tax issues, fiscal risks and
highlighted the need to increase fiscal space for public investment, In addition, the Bank
maintained an on-going dialogue o n debt management.

82

25.
Bank assistance helped reduce systemic risks and contributed to improve the
quality of financial regulatory practices. At the beginning o f the CAS, the situation o f
the Savings Bank posed a systemic risk for the financial sector. The implementation o f a
Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) between the Bank, the Central Bank and the M o F
under the P A L and the D P L successfully neutralized this risk.41 Second, the Bank, with
involvement from I F C in selected areas, assisted the Central Bank and the government in
the drafting o f k e y legislation for the financial sector.42 Third, the adjustment dialogue
emphasized improvements in the regulatory framework and capacity to regulate in the
banking and non-banking financial sectors. The capacity o f the Central Bank to supervise
the banking sector has improved.43 Accounting practices improved as banks follow IAS
and conduct international audits with the aid o f top audit companies. However, rules on
disclosure o f ownership remain to be improved further and compliance with Basle I1
principles i s not yet complete. In an effort t o enhance the capacity o f the Central Bank to
perform i t s regulatory mandate, the government has proposed amendments to the
Banking Law, which are now before parliament. Fourth, progress on the non-banking
financial sector has been slower, although a regulator is in place and the required legal
framework i s being improved.44 The private sector has gained access to international
capital markets, and increasingly i s issuing bonds o n the domestic market, although the
limited presence o f the government on the domestic market has slowed i t s development,
due to the absence of a yield curve. A grading system i s in place to assess debt issued by
domestic enterprises. Further improvements in the grading o f the sovereign debt will
improve the rating of the enterprise sector as well. This creates an incentive for major
economic players t o advocate prudent macro-economic policy. The Bank prepared a
report o n “The Development of Non-bank Financial Institutions in Ukraine” (2006) that
outlines options for deepening the financial markets.
26.
Two self-standing operations are seeking to improve access to financial
services. T w o Bank operations, approved in 2006, will support further the institutional
strengthening of the financial sector, The Export Development Project 2 (FY07) builds
o n a similar and successful previous operation and provides funds and technical
assistance to the UkrEximBank to help develop a more effective system o f export
insurance and finance for small and medium companies. The Access to Financial
Services Project (FY06) supports efforts to improve access to financial services by
smaller companies in rural areas as well as building the institutional capacity o f
41

Although the objectives o f the original M o U were fully achieved, some observers point out that the
freeze o f operations during restructuring reduced i t s franchise value. Arguably, faster implementation o f
the MOU could have been accomplished with a clearer statement o f restructuring objectives. However, a
credible solution for the frozen saving deposits and commitment to privatize did not enjoy sufficient
olitical consensus to be supported by the government and the Central Bank.
A sample o f this legislation includes: Credit Unions, Banking, Secured Transactions, National Bank,
Deposit Insurance, Mortgage, Leasing, Warehouse Receipts, and Securities. The counterpart on the side o f
the executive has been the Ministry o f Finance. Also, the Financial Sector Policy Review Board, created in
2000, has played a role, much less so since 2003. But, i t i s s t i l l consulted o n major legislative initiatives.
43 The I C R o n the Programmatic Adjustment Loan I1 reports that by 2006 the National Bank o f Ukraine
was compliant with 20 o f the 30 core Basle principles o f Bank supervision. A recent draft Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) update demonstrates further improvements in banking supervision.
44
A draft Insurance law has been prepared and awaits approval.

municipalities to finance local high-impact communal projects. Implementation o f these
two operations i s just commencing. 45

IFC’s support for the development o f financial markets took the form of
27.
direct lending in the amount of almost U S 2 3 0 million to strengthen the banks’
balance sheets and provide credit lines for SMEs, leasing, mortgage, and retail
lending. This included work with such prominent regional players as Raiffeisenbank and
SociCtC Generale in the Ukrainian market. In addition, IFC sought to strengthen financial
institutions and diversify their product offerings though a number o f advisory programs.
The Banking Sector Corporate Governance project provided training o n corporate
governance for banks throughout Ukraine, worked with NBU to develop national-level
recommendations for improving corporate governance in banks, and with banking unions
and associations to promote self-regulation o f corporate governance in the industry. The
Leasing Development project supported the nascent leasing industry, and the Mortgage
Note Development project aimed to increase the liquidity o f the primary mortgage market
by introducing a standard mortgage note.
With the entry of strategic foreign investors, banking sector consolidation i s
28.
likely to accelerate. The financial sector has grown fast and inefficient loss making
operators are being driven out. Recent entry o f foreign banks has increased competition
and bettered the quality o f financial services. As o f now, the share o f foreign capital in
the statutory capital o f banks i s close to 30 percent, up from around 10 percent in 2002.
Future development o f the banking sector i s likely to see a strong consolidation and a
substantial reduction in the more than 160 commercial banks presently registered in
Ukraine.
29.
Despite the progress that has been made, the financial sector will require
continued vigilance and attention. Fast credit growth may hide underlying quality
issues and foreign currency exposure has been increasing. Regulatory capacity needs to
h r t h e r improve to better assess underlying risks, while the regulator will need to act
quickly and decisively to liquidate insolvent institutions if the going gets tough. Equally
importantly, Ukraine needs a much more diversified system o f financial intermediation
(including equity, debt, as well as derivative instruments to hedge and diversify risks) to
help enterprises mobilize resources for investment through innovative mechanisms.
Corporate Governance and Business Environment

30.
Although the CAS objective to reform the legal basis of corporate governance
did not materialize as expected, some progress was achieved on improving corporate
governance practices by the private sector. An objective o f the CAS was to help the
country set the institutional basis for better corporate governance. The last C E M (2004)
illustrated how more transparent governance practices, in the public and private sector,
would help Ukraine develop into a modem and sophisticated economy. The idea was to
help Ukraine’s legislation and practices move t o EU standards. Progress has been mixed.
45

Approval o f the UkrEximBank operation took place much faster than usual. UkrEximBank had
experience dealing with the Bank and appreciated previous technical assistance. See ICR o n the Export
Development Project 1 on the role and appreciation o f technical assistance.

84

First, as expected, some o f the large financial and industrial groups (FIGS) have initiated
governance reform o n their own, pressured by the need to operate in the global economy.
Some smaller companies have begun to recognize the need for proper corporate
governance as well and I F C has assisted a number o f them, including second tier banks,
in improving their practices, helping to access more than US$950 m i l l i o n in external
financing as a result. Second, several pieces o f legislation, such as a Stock and Stock
Market Law, are in place and accounting practices are under modernization. 46 Third, the
WBG, jointly with other donors especially USAID, focused o n the approval o f the o f a
new Joint-stock Company Law. This has not yet been enacted and remains in the
adjustment agenda. With hindsight, experience with legislative changes in this area
suggests that a gradual approach, building o n the existing legal framework and improving
it, may be politically more feasible than a wholesale renewal o f the legal base.
Towards the end of the CAS period, emphasis on improving the governance of
3 1.
public enterprises began to have traction. Progress made on the oversight on public
enterprises was limited; only recently did the parliament approve legislation o n State
Holding Companies as well as a framework law on SOEs signaling a renewed interest in
the governance o f public enterprises. The Bank has highlighted the importance o f
improving corporate governance in public enterprises through dialogue o n adjustment
and analytical work-including the Public Finance Review (2006.) The restructuring of
major enterprises, such as Naftogaz, did not materialize to the extent expected under the
CAS. Such restructuring was one o f the conditions for moving to the high case. Both
public and private corporate governance remain important items o f the broader
competitiveness agenda, where better governance and deepening o f the financial sector
need to develop in parallel.
Various WBG initiatives sought to help improve the regulatory environment for
32.
business. The Government program placed importance o n the growth o f SMEs. The
focus o f Bank assistance centered o n improving the regulatory environment for business,
and building o n the achievements under the previous CAS. The CAS C R for the 2000
CAS noted that substantial progress had been made since the end o f the 1990s. The 2005
CAS PR likewise noted progress, as did the I C R for PAL-11. The government that took
office in 2005 committed to de-regulation and introduced reforms in taxation, customs,
licenses, permits, etc. D P L - I supported these actions and the D P L series continues to
engage in a dialogue o n regulatory practices. In addition, tax compliance surveys carried
out as part o f the State Tax Administration Modernization Project (STAMP) report less
burdensome tax e n f ~ r c e m e n t . ~There
~
was significant reduction in tax expenditures,
which the Bank supported jointly with the IMF. The IFC, through the Business Enabling
Environment Project, has been providing assistance on critical issues such as streamlining
and simplification o f inspections and permits for SMEs, simplification o f technical

The country has made progress in areas like accounting, securities, etc. Here other donors have taken the
lead. Some progress has been made with legislation in areas related to corporate governance---for
instance, the approval o f the Securities and Stock Market Law. The government has adopted 11 pieces o f
legislation relating to corporate governance that were drafted or amended with the assistance o f IFC’s
Corporate Development Project.

regulations, monitoring the business environment through representative surveys, and
conducting outreach, information and advocacy work to ensure adoption and
implementation o f reforms. With the support o f these efforts, laws o n permits, licensing
and inspections have recently been approved. However, the Bank’s Private Sector
Development project, which included support to improve regulatory practices at the
regional level, could not be implemented and was ~ancelled.~’

33.
However, international rankings do not reflect these reported gains. In the
2007 Doing Business Survey, Ukraine ranks 139 - behind both Belarus (1 10) and
Moldova (92). Individual dimensions o f the Doing Business rankings show significant
variation, with the costs o f contract enforcement assessed as relatively l o w (rank 46),
together with access to credit (rank 68), while notable improvements were made with
respect to starting a business (improvement from rank 122 t o 109 between 2005 and
2007). Recent IFC reviews o f the quality o f the business environment concur that
Ukraine ranks l o w with respect to i t s neighbors and identified taxation, licenses and
inspections as the k e y challenges. The Corruption Perceptions Index for 2006 (TI) ranks
Ukraine 99 (out o f 163) countries, placing it among the most corrupt in Europe and below
i t s immediate neighbors. The dissonance between the internal reporting o f progress and
the external ranking calls for further analysis to identify whether it is due t o reporting
lags in international rankings or whether - while Ukraine has been making progress - i t
has lagged behind the pace in the rest o f the world. This said, i t should be noted that the
rate o f business entry was around 8 percent, a rate higher than the target set under the
DPL-I. Towards the end o f the CAS, the Bank prepared a Private Sector Development
Note (2007), which provides a comprehensive review o f recent progress and diagnostic
o f the main policy challenges facing Ukraine in this area.
Property Rights

34.
Concerns with transparency came to dominate the privatization agenda.
Transparent privatization, a CAS objective, proved controversial at the early stage of the
CAS as efforts at introducing transparency were grounded o n domestic procedures that
could not easily be evaluated a posteriori. Therefore efforts to evaluate transparency, as
those o f the Bank in the context o f PAL-I1 conditionality, were severely h a n d i ~ a p p e d . ~ ~
The government that came to power in 2005 questioned previous privatizations and
successfully reversed some, including that o f the large steel enterprise, Krivorizhstal.
The initiative that came to be known as “re-privatization” caused concern o n the sanctity
o f property rights and unsettled investors, as fears emerged that Ukraine m a y not have the
institutional infrastructure to determine which privatizations had been done fairly.
Nonetheless, there is now greater public attention to issues o f transparency and
competitiveness in privatization, which may have a lasting impact. In practice, the
process o f privatization will continue to be politically controversial and thus remain a
difficult area for Bank engagement. In the future, the Bank can still add value in the
privatization area by taking a sector rather than a general approach-for instance, i t can

86

help in critical sectors like energy, transportation, etc. IFC, o n i t s part, is considering
providing post-privatization support to selected companies in these sectors.
The FY04-FY07 CAS proposed to help the government modernize agriculture
35.
by helping develop the institutions for an active land market and providing access to
financial resources. The role o f the Bank in agriculture has not been as significant and
effective as the CAS expected. However, some partial achievements can be noted. Bank
assistance to agriculture centered o n helping to consolidate the process o f land
privatization as envisaged by the Land Code o f 2001. Land titling has begun but has not
yet been completed. So far, the government has issued around 6 million land certificates.
The Bank contribution through the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre System Development
Project will be around 1.5 m i l l i o n titles as opposed to the intended four milli~n.~'
However, a five-year moratorium o n the sale o f agricultural land introduced in 2001 has
been extended twice to January 2008 and may be extended again given slow progress in
the establishment o f a registry for property r i g h t s in land. The Bank supported, through
adjustment lending and the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre System Development
Project, the passage o f legislation o n the creation o f a single system o f land cadastre and
registry o f rights in real estate, bringing together separate land and urban real estate
systems. However, the law has not been implemented yet, against the background of
disagreements as to where the single registry should be located. Lastly, the passage of the
Secured Transactions L a w and the approval o f the Access to Financial Services Project
(FY06) should facilitate the financing o f agriculture. A project on rural development,
foreseen by the CAS, did not materialize.
Energy
The CAS helped strengthen the energy sector. The CAS focused o n improving
36.
the financial status o f the energy sector and o n investments to upgrade reliability. The
energy agenda evolved during CAS implementation, especially after the CPR, with
greater emphasis o n institution building, moving to European standards, a broader
investment agenda and leveraging impact on the environment.
Bank assistance contributed to improve the financial health and transparency
37.
of the energy sector. First, the emphasis adjustment operations placed o n financial

discipline in the energy sector produced positive result^:^' collection arrears o n electricity
and gas tariffs declined, and cash collection ratios were above 90 percent until the rise in
utility prices in late 2006. Higher payment discipline in the energy complex contributed
to higher payment discipline in the economy overall. Second, the government improved
transparency and reduced the opportunities for corruption by requiring direct cash
payments from Russia for gas transit fees through Ukraine (amounting t o around US$2
billion annually). Third, electricity and gas tariffs are closer to operational recovery
levels. A s a result, the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector has fallen from over 6
percent o f GDP in 2003 to 2.6 percent in 2006. In addition, the Bank has assisted in the

The titling o f the 1.5 m i l l i o n ha has not been completed yet, partly because the Bank project procedures
are more thorough than the procedures utilized to grant the other titles.
This is not the case always for municipal services, especially heat and water.

preparation of an action plan o n the financial recovery o f the energy sector under the
D P L agenda.

38.
Despite the improvements, major challenges remain. The backlog o f interenterprise debts in the energy sector remains high, limiting the scope o f private sector
involvement. While an energy debt restructuring law was enacted with the support o f the
P A L and D P L programs it remains to be fully implemented. The rising prices o f energy
are testing payment discipline-arrears
are beginning to reappear-and the pass-through
o f energy prices creates social policy challenges. So far, however, the country i s
adjusting rapidly to the increases and a process o f increasing energy efficiency i s
underway. Improvements in the targeting o f social assistance to cushion the impact o f
rising energy and utility bills are emerging as a policy priority.
39.
Bank Pnancial assistance has focused increasingly on refurbishing existing
infrastructure. Investment projects in the electricity sector have been good performers in
Ukraine. The K i e v District Heating Project was completed satisfactorily, following
successful completion earlier o f the K i e v Public Buildings energy project. A renewed
energy investment agenda i s linked to the refurbishment o f infrastructure and energy
efficiency. T o further support the rehabilitation and expansion o f the sector, the Bank
dropped the APL format foreseen in the CAS to allow preparation o f parallel investment
operations. The Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, approved after the CPR, is the first
operation in this series, followed by the Energy Transmission project, approved by the
Board in August 2007.
40.
Besides the emphasis on investment afler the CPR, the Bank is supporting
greater integration of the energy sector with Europe. As a first step to assist in the
integration o f Ukraine’s electricity complex to the EU grid, the Bank i s supporting
changes in domestic legislation required to the make the systems compatible.
Additionally, the support the Bank has been providing to Ukraine to qualify for the
benefits o f the Kyoto Protocol bears significance for the agenda o f increasing energy
efficiency and moving to “green investments.”
41,

Bank work on energy has combined well adjustment, investment and analytical
work The combination o f analytical work, technical assistance and dialogue helped
develop a credible roadmap for strengthening the energy sector. At the same time, the
approach was realistic, mindful that the energy agenda i s broad and that it takes time to
achieve all o f the desired results. The agenda ahead remains vast and stability o f the
sector is at risk from the rapid increases in gas import prices. Work o n an investment
pipeline o f energy projects has also helped to improve the capacity o f the energy complex
to evaluate projects.
The Knowledge Economy

42.

The Bank did not make the expected contribution to advancing the Knowledge
and Information agenda. The CAS foresaw a contribution to increase the sophistication
o f the economy and develop a knowledge-based economy. The Bank hoped to contribute
with a Knowledge Economy Assessment, which did not take place. In addition, poor
implementation performance o f the E-development Project led to i t s suspension, the
status in which i t remained at the closing date. Ukraine has a sizeable potential in

88

knowledge intensive activities given the existing research institutions, the highly
qualified personnel and the number o f patents. These resources remain under-utilized.
Pillar 2: Poverty reduction, mitigation of social risks and strengthening of middle
class

43.
The CAS supported an ambitious government strategy to increase the size of
the middle class, reduce poverty in urban and r u r a l areas and improve the social
security system. Rapid increases in wages supported by rising labor productivity
exceeded CAS expectations. The rapid growth in wages combined with mounting social
assistance accelerated poverty reduction throughout the economy (including in rural areas
and among the elderly) to one o f the lowest levels in the region.52 However, the intended
improvement in the targeting o f social assistance t o the poor and the structural reform o f
the pension system did not materialize, although in both cases there were clear blueprints
at the beginning o f the CAS period. Political pressure led to substantial increases in
social assistance and social security, but there has been little demand for structural
changes in the system to increase i t s financial efficiency and sustainability. So far, this
has been possible due to the rapid recovery o f labor productivity and the growth in real
wages from very l o w levels. Over the long-term, this strategy i s not compatible with
maintaining the competitiveness o f the economy.
44.
The B a n k helped develop capacity for poverty and social analysis: since the
CPR, three studies (PULSE I and I 1 and a 2007 Poverty Assessment Update) have
evaluated the evolution and status o f poverty. The Labor Study (2006) and the Public
Finance Review (2006) both examined the taxation o f labor, including social security
contributions, and concluded that reducing social security contributions (now at 4 1
percent o f gross salaries) should be a priority. However, while the Labor Study argues
that lower payroll taxes are key to improve the functioning o f the labor market, the Public
Finance Review cautions that a lowering o f tax rates should go hand in hand with
measures to improve compliance and close loopholes, including importantly in the
Simplified Tax System. The Non-Banking Financial Institutions Review (2006)
examined the synergies between the development o f the non-banking financial sector and
pension reform.
45.

The dialogue on pensions focused on the financial sustainability of the Pension
Fund; however progress on structural reform of the pension system has been limited.

The dialogue on pensions, especially after the CPR (2005), centered o n protecting the
financial balance o f the Pension Fund, the deficit o f which reached 3.3 percent o f GDP in
2005, following rapid pension increases that year. D P L - I helped bring this deficit down
to around 1 percent o f GDP. W h i l e the balance o f the Fund has improved, the
fundamental reforms to assure its long-term sustainability have been postponed.53 The
delays in increasing the pension eligibility age, reducing the social security contributions
52 The CAS target “ratio between average pensions to the subsistence level to reach 37 percent” has been
met.
53 The Bank carried out periodical analysis o f the financial sustainability o f the pension system. The recent
PFR examines both pensions and social assistance, pointing to the unfinishedagenda and i t s fiscal
consequences.

89

and introducing a second pillar are keeping Ukraine behind other countries in the
region.54 Political factors rather than the lack o f reform roadmaps explain the slow pace
o f reform.
46.

The WBG commenced providing assistance to simplijlj, and improve the
administrative capacity of the social assistance institutions. The Bank, as foreseen in

the CAS, supported improvements o f the administrative capacity o f the social security
institutions. Since the CPR, a database o f social assistance beneficiaries i s in place under
the Social Assistance System Modernization Project (2006). The project targets a
significant reduction in administrative costs for the government and beneficiaries. The
Social Insurance Administration Modernization Project (under preparation) plans to unify
social security contributions and improve their administration. The implementation o f
the Ukrainian Social Investment Fund (USIF) has picked up pace recently led by an
active Supervisory Board. It has completed 222 micro-projects (June 2006) o f good
engineering quality and with active community participation. Donors have also been
quite active (KfW, DFID, SIDA, EU, and CIDA). The project remains to have a
demonstration impact at the national level, however.
47.

Future attempts at reform should make better use of linkages across reform
initiatives in social security and assistance to facilitate implementation. For instance,

there are linkages between social assistance and pensions-well-targeted
social
assistance t o the elderly poor can help lower the pressure for increases in minimum
pensions. In addition, there i s a clear linkage between the reform o f social assistance and
pensions and opening fiscal space for investment. Also, the increase in energy prices and
the need to soften the b l o w on the poor open a window o f opportunity for reform, which
hopefully will lead to a more efficient targeting and open fiscal space for other critical
priorities. Lastly, it i s important t o keep in mind that given the political sensitivity of
these issues, the sector authorities m a y not be fully empowered to commit to reform and
often the dialogue has to go the highest level o f government.
Pillar 3: Comprehensive and harmonized human development

48.
Progress in increasing basic social indicators has been mixed despite major
increases in budgetary allocations. The CAS proposed to help improve access to quality
services-education, healthcare and water-and battle the TB and AIDS epidemics. The
quality o f some basic services has been improving. For instance, maternal and child
mortality levels reached the CAS goals. However, the decline in l i f e expectancy
continues and l i f e expectancy for women is 12-13 years higher than for men, compared to
an EU average difference o f 6 years. The biggest shortcoming, however, has been a TB
and A I D S challenge that remains unmet. Mortality from AIDS stands at 5.1 per 100,000,
while the CAS had targeted .7 per 100,000. HIV cases stand at 15.2 out o f 100,000,
while the CAS expected 14.1. TB incidence stands at 84.1 per 100,000 above the CAS
target o f 56.4

The recent PFR provides an in-depth analysis o f the status o f the pension system, the options for reform
and the linkage with labor market issues.

49.
I n education, a major gain has been increasing access of children under 5 to
pre-school education, now up to 78.7 percent in urban areas and 36.2 percent in rural
areas. At the outset o f the CAS, pre-school education was receding. Enrollment in
secondary education i s now 99.2 percent in line with CAS expectations. The absolute
number in post-secondary education has increased steadily. In addition, the government
i s implementing pilots to improve the quality o f education through the adoption o f
international standards. The government in early 2007 rolled out the Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS), which it piloted in 2005.
Resources allocated to education have increased to reach 6.4 percent o f GDP in 2006.
This said, however, upgrading the quality o f education remains a priority to equip the
country in advancing a strong competitiveness agenda.

50.
The Bank agenda supporting human development was cautious. Human
development issues did not figure highly in the adjustment operations as efforts to engage
in policy dialogue during the previous CAS found little traction. In addition, the
adjustment agenda was already quite overburdened. Analytical work has been sparse.
The Bank provided assistance for the development o f sector strategies and the analytical
work o n poverty examined access issues in health and education. In addition an analysis
o f the Socio-Economic Impact o f HIV/AIDS was carried out (2006) which had some
impact in re-energizing the public debate o n the need to contain both epidemics and may
lay the foundation to more effective engagement with the government in the future. An
analysis o f public expenditure in social sectors, currently underway, should add helpful
insights. Investment projects supported the fight against TB and AIDS, education reform
and improvements in water supply.
51.
The contribution of the Bank to arrest the TB and AIDS epidemic has been
modest. The CAS priority set o n supporting the government’s efforts to contain and treat
TB and H I V / A I D S was correct, but implementation o f the supporting Bank’s TB and
AIDS project has been unsatisfactory. Arguably, the availability o f significant grant
funding, including through the Global Fund reduced the attractiveness o f Bank resources.
Moreover there has been significant opposition to new alternative methods in dealing
with TB. Capacity in the Ministry o f Health to handle procurement and prioritize
spending strategically i s weak. The Bank and the donor community have rallied around
to press o n the government to act in the face o f these epidemics. The Bank project was
partially suspended for more than a year, and while the suspension was lifted in FY07
and the closing date extended by 18 months to December 2008, prospects for successful
implementation remain uncertain. Recently, as a result o f a broad stakeholder dialogue
(informed in part by the Socio-Economic Impact o f H I V / A I D S study), new agreements
have been reached o n the implementation o f the project, although the details remain to be
worked out. As a result o f the delays in implementation, the project has not made a
significant contribution on the ground. While a Health Sector Strategy was prepared, in
the light o f implementation difficulties in the existing portfolio, planned additional
investment operations to support the strategy’s implementation have not proceeded.
Recently, the Bank has begun t o support a pilot to explore ways by which to reduce the

91

impact of environmental hazards on the health o f the population and plans to expand this
approach under the new CPS.55

52.
The Bank's support in education is beginning to show some results. The
Access to Quality Secondary Education Project supports institutional strengthening,
curricula reform, education standards and rationalization o f the school network. Early
results include the establishment o f the Policy Planning Department in the Ministry o f
Education and attention to improving management and information practices. Pilots are
underway to improve quality and the country is beginning to set the basis for testing
educational outcomes and rank Ukraine among i t s peers.
Despite some initial

renovation o f municipal water and sanitation infrastructure; there are deficiencies in the
quality o f water and sanitation services and finances o f local utilities are weak. Providing
this support has proven challenging. Despite satisfactory completion, the Lviv Water
project implementation was often delayed as a result o f local political disagreements
affecting timely tariff increases and investments. Concerns o f central authorities with
borrowing by local governments led to a system o f required counter-guarantees, which
often are not easy to secure from local authorities with short-term interests. Similar
factors delayed preparation o f a multi-city project (Urban Infrastructure Project, UIP)
supporting improving water delivery in several cities. The project was, however,
approved in early FY08.
54.

Assisting Ukraine in human development, parh'cularly in health, requires a
revised approach. A revised approach should begin with greater emphasis on analytical
work and dialogue to develop a shared vision o n how the Bank can help. The challenge
in Ukraine is not resources, but increasing efficiency and focusing on results. One entry
point i s the link with public expenditure and decentralization. The country needs both to
reduce the absorption o f resources by the public sector and improve service delivery. In
addition, the Bank could try reaching out beyond the government to generate a broader
dialogue on the health and education challenges and the options for change.
Pillar 4: Protection of the natural environment

55.
The ambitious environment agenda of the CAS was scaled down during
implementation. Ukraine inherited substantial environment challenges, with energy
intensity among the highest in the world. Oddly, the economic contraction improved
some o f the key environment indicators, but as the economy recovers quickly, Ukraine
needs to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution to maintain i t s competitiveness
and prevent further environmental degradation. The CAS set an ambitious environment
agenda building o n the National Environment Strategy prepared during the previous

environment risk plan together with civil society and government.

92

CAS. Implementation o f the strategy fell short o f expectations, due in part t o institutional
weaknesses in the sector. Nonetheless, the Bank made some positive contributions.

56.
The goal to build effective environment institutions was not realized. The CAS
proposed an Environment Institutional Investment Loan to help strengthen the
institutional capacity o f the sector. The lack o f commitment o n the side o f the authorities
cut short the effort. Similarly, lack o f ownership by the central level o f government and a
very open-ended design led to the cancellation o f the Azov Black Sea Corridor
Biodiversity Conservation Project. More narrowly defined technical operations (such as
Ozone Depletion) fared better. In addition, P A L helped improve the finances o f the
environment sector through a revision o f the fee structure. The concern, however, is that
these funds are becoming part o f general resources and are not allocated to environment
uses as intended.
57.
Bank support Jtelped Ukraine to begin profiting from the provisions of the
Kyoto protocol. Given that it was not possible to carry out the Environment Institutional
Investment Loan, the focus shifted to the implementation o f the Kyoto Protocol. The
Bank signed, as Trustee for the Netherlands European Carbon Facility, an Emissions
Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) with UkrHydroEnergo. This is the first ERPA
in Ukraine. The cooperation o f the authorities in the energy sector was critical to achieve
this result. Still, Ukraine has yet t o make full use o f the international opportunities for
cooperation on environment issues.
Pillar 5: Integration into the w o r l d economic and financial system

58.
Over the CAS period, Ukraine significantly advanced its integration into the
global economy, as articulated in the Government program. The EU and the U S
declared Ukraine a market economy and the country i s now close to WTO membership
with the recent approval o f a large body o f required legislation and the completion o f
most bilateral agreement^.^^ The desire to j o i n the WTO proved to be an effective driver
for reform. Progress in reform in the context W T O accession covers issues such as: (a)
the reform o f the tariff system; (b) reform o f customs procedures; (c) reduction or
phasing out o f export duties o n scrap metals and selected agricultural products; (d)
reform o f the standardization, licensing and labeling regimes to remove bias against
importers; (e) adopting a stronger system o f property rights; and (0 allowing foreign
banks to open branches in Ukraine. The Bank, with the help o f a Dutch grant as well as
under the D P L - I program, provided effective and timely technical assistance to the
government in preparing for WTO accession. The EU i s ready to consider a Free Trade
Agreement with Ukraine, once i t joins the W T O .
59.
Ukraine has substantially liberalized its trade regime, especially since 2005. The
government reformed the customs authority (2005) and reduced the level o f import
tariffs, slashing the average tariff to 5.1 percent, significantly exceeding WTO
requirements. In 2005, a government program to reduce smuggling (“Contraband Stop”)

56 During 2005 and 2007 more than 70 laws and legal amendments were adopted to make Ukrainian
legislation compliant with the WTO. Most bilateral deals have been signed (except with the Kyrgyz
Republic).

93

initiated significant improvements in the function o f the State Customs Service. Support
for these initiatives was provided under the D P L I.However, successive governments
have o n occasion intervened in export markets through quantitative restrictions (on grain
in 2006-2007), and significant work remains t o be done to complete customs reform. The
Bank contributed a Trade Study (2004), which emphasized economic diversification to
improve the resilience o f the economy. The message o f diversification remains valid and
should be part o f any competitiveness agenda moving forward.
Ukraine also made considerable progress reforming the telecommunications
60.
sector. T h e government established a communications regulator supported by a new
legal framework. The Bank provided support through the D P L I.Since then, the
government has rebalanced telecom tariffs and liberalized the allocation o f mobile
licenses, frequencies and inter-connections. Mobile telephony has experienced high
investment, rapid growth, and competition, with national penetration levels now
approaching 100 percent. Thanks to greater competition and improved regulation, tariffs
for international calls have fallen from around 2-3 times European levels at the beginning
o f the CAS to within 30 percent o f the EU average. The D P L series will continue to
provide support in this area as part o f a broader effort to reduce logistics costs and
improve trade and transport facilitation in the country.

Pillar 6: Dynamic regional development and reduction o f regional imbalances

61.
Although regional development was and remains a key government prior&
this is not matched by the development of a clear roadmap or even agreement on the
objectives underlying this agenda. Regional development issues have been controversial
and political consensus has been difficult to come by, especially regarding the balance of
power between the center and regions. Lacking clear direction at the national level, the
Bank undertook isolated interventions.
62.
Still, the Bank helped advance various initiatives that promoted stronger local
institutions. First, continuing the agenda o f the previous CAS, the Bank, through the
P A L and D P L programs, continued to engage the authorities o n improving the system o f
inter-governmental budget transfers, an agenda that remains incomplete. T h e Public
Finance Review (2006) provided an analysis o f the capital budgeting system, which i s
being extended to the local government level in a second volume to be completed in
FY08.
63.
Second, the CAS continued to support greater local government accountability
and the capacity o f c i v i l society to organize locally through the People’s Voice project,
which helps organize citizens’ oversight over the delivery o f public services at the level
o f municipalities. T h i s program has been extended from 4 to 6 cities, and was favorably
reviewed by the Canadian government which finances it. However, the original intention
o f articulating a national strategy out o f the lessons from the pilot experiences remains
unfulfilled. Attention, therefore, is needed to assure the sustainability o f the efforts.
64.
Lastly, the Bank sought to set the basis to support regions and municipalities
through selected investment projects. The proposed Municipal Development Finance
project i s now part o f the Access to Financial Services (FY06) project, which will finance
local capital investments. Project implementation has j u s t commenced. The CAS
94

proposed to support regions in improving their business environment, but the cancellation
o f the Private Sector Development project cut short the initiative, and WBG support is
now largely provided by IFC, which has developed a strong regional presence. Local
deregulation continues to be critical to improve the quality o f the business environment.
Data shows great regional variation in the quality o f the business environment, with the
western regions generally showing worse performance than the east.

65.
The CAS originally foresaw a project to support European integration with focus
on regional development. The project, however, was not developed.
Pillar 7: Integrity o f public governance

66.

Public Jinancial management made signiJicant progress during the CAS, as
part of a general effort to improve g o v e r n a n ~ eThe
. ~ ~ management o f public finance is
now com rehensive and transparent building o n a modem Budget Code approved before
the CAS. An internal corruption vulnerability review, whilst highlighting that Ukraine
must be considered high governance risk, nonetheless concluded that risks to Bank
projects were acceptable and to some extent mitigated by the Bank’s fiduciary controls.
Analytical work in the PFR has provided a basis o n which to articulate future public
expenditure reform.

ps

67.

Developments of public administration and civil sewice, however, did not meet
the expectations set in the CAS of moving quickly to European standards. While key
government institutions are n o w stronger and more capable (Central Bank, Ministry of
Finance, and the Energy Complex), this progress has failed to extend to most line
ministries. Nonetheless, the authorities have shown skill in facing multiple challenges in
the management o f economic affairs in spite o f imperfect domestic institutions. M o r e
realistic expectations can help guide the future o f Bank assistance in public expenditure
and c i v i l service reform.

68.
Progress in improving public expenditure management was gradual but
positive. A first step was the completion o f the Treasury project, which helped put in
place a unified t r e a ~ u r y . ’ ~The Public Finance Management Reform (PFMR) project,
under preparation, seeks to complete the Treasury-I agenda and broaden the scope to a
more comprehensive reform o f government finances, including consolidation o f
information systems, budget planning, debt management, and audit. The implementation
o f the Budget Code, approved under the previous CAS, improved the comprehensiveness
o f the budget and transparency o f budgetary practices. A major recent improvement, as
already noted, was the collection in cash o f the transit fees for gas.
69.
I n addition, the Bank assisted with the design of an internal audit system. The
Control and Revision Unit (KRU) o f the M o F i s responsible for internal audit, while the
Chamber o f Accounts provides external audit functions for the government. The
57 As noted previously, the CAS retained emphasis o n the supply and demand for institutions. Hence, the
governance agenda (institution building) cut across the board.
58
See PEFA Report (2006). The PEFA reports strengths in the credibility and the predictability o f the
budget process and its comprehensiveness. As noted capital budgeting, control over public enterprises, and
procurement are weaknesses.
59 The systems developed under the project were deemed provisional. See Treasury ICR.

95

assistance provided by the Bank i s helping redesign the role o f the JSRU in line with EU
principles on internal control. The Cabinet o f Ministers approved a white paper
launching this initiative under the DPL I,although progress in implementation i s slow.

70.

The CAS foresaw improvements in capital budgeting, but initial efforts proved
timid and ineffective.6o A more forceful effort took place recently with the 2006 Public
Finance Review (PFR), which identified major constraints t o proper capital budgeting.
First, large increases in current expenditure have reduced the fiscal space for public
investment. In addition, capital allocations go mostly for transfers to public enterprises
and to repairs. Second, government lacks the capacity to identify and evaluate
investments reducing ownership for donor finance initiatives. In efforts to build domestic
ownership o f investment projects and reduce transaction costs, the Bank has increasingly
emphasized the increased use o f country systems for project implementation.

71.
The greater focus and coherence of Bank assistance on public finance
management issues provides a possible entry point to the reform of public services
more generally.61 A more coherent framework to the reform o f public expenditure can
help streamline expenditures and advance sector reform, especially o n social issues, and
help curb the rising levels o f public expenditure. The Bank work benefited from stable
counterparts at the M o F during most o f the C A S period.
72.
Progress on public procurement reversed. The CAS-supported implementation
o f the 2001 Procurement Law aiming to bring practices in Ukraine in line with WTO and
EU requirements.
Despite initial progress, vested interests in and outside the
Government and Parliament not only blocked fill implementation but sought and
obtained a significant reversal.
Moreover, capacity constraints at all levels of
government remain serious obstacles to the development o f a modern procurement
system. N e w legislation out-sources key oversight responsibilities to an NGO, with n o
effective public control, while fragmenting the implementation o f public procurement
across government agencies. The parliament overrode a Presidential veto on this
legislation by mustering more than the required two thirds o f votes (December 2005).
The Bank and other donors have actively sought amendments to the current law. The
Bank analyzed the current situation and the options in the Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR, 2006) and revisited the issues also in the PFR (2006).

73.

Progress in public administration and civil service reform has been slow. The
CAS supported the government in the intended effort to bring public administration and
c i v i l service practices in line with EU standards. But, the expected major overhaul o f
public administration and the c i v i l service did not take place. A technical assistance
operation to support this reform consequently did not materialize. A note o n public
administration included in the PREM Governance Review (dated February 2005)
proposed an Action Plan, which s t i l l awaits implementation. While a modern c i v i l

With hindsight, the early emphasis on perfecting transfers to the local level distracted attention from

broader public expenditure issues where attention was required.

96

service law aligned with EU principles has been prepared i t has so not been presented to
parliament and may be further delayed.

74.
Efforts took place, however, to reform important individual public institutions,
such as the tax sewice and the MoF. The government brought the State Tax
Administration (STA) and the Treasury under the Ministry o f Finance in 2005 and a
functional review o f the M o F was prepared. The Bank is supporting the STA, through a
direct technical assistance operation, to undertake a comprehensive modernization with
emphasis o n improving tax payer compliance, reducing costs and introducing
mechanisms o f accountability. A panel o f external reviewers was appointed to take stock
periodically o f progress in the reform o f the tax service. In addition, local boards
(Collegiums) with the participation o f civil society organizations provide oversight at the
local level. However, implementation delays and the nature o f the project as a long-term
institutional transformation, mean that i t s impact has so far been relatively limited. The
government that took office in 2005 also undertook efforts to reform the State Customs
Service with the aim to reduce contraband and in line with WTO requirements. These
efforts were supported under the DPL I.

75.

Despite the imperfect institutional environment, Ukraine has faced with success
the major challenges of transition to generate growth and reduce poverty. Arguably,
this success has limited the appetite for more thorough reforms o f public institutions. I t
remains a fact though that Ukraine would benefit from a more disciplined and
coordinated public administration and a modern civil service. The lack o f progress
lowers the capacity to carry out reform initiatives across the board. For instance, the
concentration o f policy decision power at the top o f the government limits the capacity o f
ministries to develop policy initiatives and to commit to their implementation.

76.

Some progress was made in improving the regulation of natural monopolies.
A s part o f WTO accession efforts, the country put in place a modern regulatory
framework for telecommunications. Also, the DPL agenda includes the strengthening o f
the
energy
regulator-NERC-and
the
continued
liberalization
o f the
telecommunications sector (tariff rebalancing, frequency allocations, mobile licenses and
interconnections).

WORLD BANKGROUP
PERFORMANCE

IBRD Lending

77.
Bank performance in lending over the CAS period was satisfactory as a whole,
although tainted by persistent problems in implementing the investment lending
portfolio. During CAS period the Bank approved 8 operations, o f which two were
adjustment loans and 6 investment projects. Adjustment constituted around h a l f o f total
commitments and t w o thirds o f disbursements. Major results from lending interventions
during the CAS therefore were achieved through adjustment lending. In investment
lending, the Bank overestimated both the ability o f the country to absorb and ability o f
the Bank to deliver a large lending program. In comparison with base-case lending
programmed in CAS and re-confirmed by the CAS progress report in the amount o f U S $

97

2.4 billion, actual commitments for the period o f FY04-07 were only U S $ 1.1 billion

Policy-based (adjustment) lending has played the leading role in producing
78.
results62. As the review o f effectiveness o f Bank assistance under each o f the individual
pillars shows, the policy reform agenda, supported by the adjustment operations,
delivered the main results expected and achieved under the CAS.63 K e y achievements
that adjustment supported included: (a) financial discipline in the public and private
sectors; (b) removing systemic threats to the financial sector; (c) setting the basis for
financial regulation and improving regulatory practices; (c) opening up the economy to
trade and finance; (d) keeping a prudent fiscal position; (e) improvements in property
rights; ( f ) partial de-regulation o f the economy to encourage entry and moving out o f the
shadow economy; and (g) improving the financial and technical performance o f the
energy complex. These reforms were enough to allow the Ukrainian economy to respond
to the demand stimulus from abroad and - as productivity and wages recovered - to the
domestic demand pull.

79.

Variousfactors explain the relative effectiveness of adjustment lending:
0

First, adjustment operations have helped Ukraine signal to international markets
i t s commitment to and progress in moving to a market economy. This signaled
strong ownership not just o f the government but o f k e y business interests.

During CAS implementation, the Bank produced a paper on lessons from experience with Bank
conditionality as a result o f which the Bank issued new guidelines for conditionality reflected in a change
in the name o f the main Bank instrument from Adjustment to Development Policy lending.
63 IEG rated PAL-2 and DPL-1 as satisfactory.

98

0

Second, the adjustment program helped the authorities coordinate implementation
of the policy agenda among different agencies. In this area, analytical work was
an important support and complement t o the adjustment dialogue. The policy
dialogue helped maintain continuity across different administrations.

Third, although budgetary support i s not as important in financing terms as it was
early on, the government continues t o appreciate that the Bank provides long-term
funds at competitive prices and these helped improve Ukraine’s debt profile.
Thus, even Ukraine’s most recent international bond issue at the peak o f favorable
emerging market sentiment achieved only a five-year maturity.

80.
Nonetheless, the broad agenda supported by adjustment moved at a pace slower
than expected. Adjustment was conceived as an instrument to tackle broad systemic or
thematic constraints. T o a large extent i t met this challenge with success by breaking k e y
constraints and helping move the economy ahead. The downside o f the approach was the
tendency to cover too many areas as adjustment became the predominant instrument o f
policy dialogue in areas where the Bank was engaged. Arguably, the broad canvas o f
topics covered under adjustment reduced the focus and m a y have reduced the Bank’s
e f f e c t i ~ e n e s s . ~In
~ addition, the institution-building agenda moved at a slow pace,
especially when it required legislative approval. Delays in the legislative agenda largely
account for the fact that instead o f the planned annual series, the gap between adjustment
operations was around two years o n average.
81.
Rapid economic growth and increasing creditworthiness reduced the urgency of
and commitment to broad-based reforms.65 The slower than anticipated progress did not
prevent Ukraine from achieving most o f the targeted CAS outcomes, suggesting that
these reforms, while critical to sustain growth in the longer term, were not immediate
roadblocks for economic growth and poverty reduction. Transition successes despite
partial reform efforts include:
0

The government was able to manage increases in pensions within a solid fiscal
framework-the lack o f pension reform was not a stumbling block.
The government was able to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy
sector, with a relatively weak regulator and without continuing the
privatization process.

0

The partial development o f the non-banking financial sector did not limit
access to financing by major groups as they had access to local banks or

The IEG Report (2007) also points to the wide range o f issues covered under the adjustment agenda.
Many important reforms or results were not accomplished as the CAS had foreseen: (a) pension reform;
(b) full compliance with Basle norms and an effective non-banking regulatory framework under
implementation; (c) legislation on private corporate governance; (d) more aggressive de-regulation o f the
economy; (c) public administration reform in line with European norms; (d) increased effectiveness in
social sector expenditure, etc. Lastly, as noted, the program in Ukraine did not move to the high case. The
triggers for a high case considered restructuring o f the main public gas company NAFTAGAZ, accelerated
reforms o f the Savings Bank, accelerated implementation o f measures to j o i n the W T O and accelerated
implementation o f measures to improve public sector accountability. Only regarding the WTO did the
64

65

country move in an accelerated fashion.

As a result of the above mentioned difJiculties, the resultsproduced with the
help of investment projects were modest There are several reasons for this:
First, projected results o f investment lending in the CAS relied heavily o n the
implementation o f seven key investment projects that were ready at the beginning o f
the CAS: the Social Investment Fund, the TB/AIDS Control Project, the Private
Sector Development project (PSD), the State Tax Administration Modernization

project, the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre project and the E-development project.
O f these seven projects, the PSD project was cancelled, while E-development,
TB/AIDS, and the Rural Land Titling and Cadastre project were all partially or
completely suspended for extended periods o f time. The projected CAS results did
not foresee the weight o f implementation problems in these key operations.
0
Second, most o f these projects sought a high degree o f institutional change, which
meant that, by design, the projects were not expected to produce results right away.
For instance, the State Tax Administration Modernization project was designed as an
APL-with an initial focus o n the design o f new processes and pilots and full
implementation in later APL operations.
0
Third, the rest o f the portfolio (five investment operations already under
implementation as the CAS was approved) also suffered from implementation
difficulties and several projects were restructured. This means that they may not meet
all o f the intended development objectives.
0
Fourth, the intended simplification o f country internal procedures for approval
and implementation o f projects did not take place. N e w projects-as opposed to
repeater operations-continue
to take long to develop, approve and reach
effectiveness.
0
Fifth, in a highly fractured public administration, the lack o f proper capital
budgeting has meant that investment projects are often seen as “owned” by the Bank
and not the government.

Lastly, projects implemented by central government agencies ran into severe
implementation difficulties due to the complicated procedures o f the central
government. Projects experienced lesser implementation problems in autonomous
spending units such as state-owned enterprises, especially in the energy sector.66

87.

The Bank was proactive in analyzing the causes of poor investment lending
performance and developing recommendations for improvement. An internal review o f
investment lending (2005) proposed to: (a) to restructure or cancel non-performing
projects; (b) to reduce the institution building components o f investment projects; (c) to
move to a greater use country systems; (d) to encourage the government to simplify its
procedures for the approval and implementation o f operations, and ( f ) to improve internal
coordination between Bank teams. These recommendations are under implementation.
The Bank and the government have advanced in cleaning up the portfolio through
cancellation or r e - p r ~ g r a m r n i n g . In
~ ~addition, new operations have sharper objectives

As result o f the difficulties experienced in the implementation o f investment operations (especially those
in place at the beginning o f the CAS), investment and adjustment operations were not as complementary as
expected. The investment operations were supposed to help build the institutions in areas critical for the
reform agenda-taxation, land titling, private sector development, pensions and social security, technology,
environment, etc. Cancellations, delays and restructuring meant delays in achieving results that would have
made the reform agenda more effective.
67
The following projects were cancelled: PSD, Azov-Black Sea (GEF), while E-development closed at the
end o f an extended period o f suspension. Loan amounts were reduced significantly in the Kyiv District
Heating and Land Titling and Cadastre projects, while two further projects were under partial suspension
for extended periods (TB and HIV-AIDS and Land Titling and Cadastre).
66

102

and are less institutionally loaded, which should make it easier to implement them and to
evaluate results. Greater use i s being made o f country systems, with the Social
Administration Modernization Project, approved in FY06, leading the way. Reducing the
complexity o f the design and focusing on the rules under which executing agencies
operate can help improve the performance o f investment operations.
88.
These efforts have yielded some improvements in performance, but Ukraine still
lags the region in disbursement performance. The ratio o f disbursements to net
commitments has been increasing, albeit slowly, from 8.4 percent in F Y 0 6 to 11 percent
in FY07, with initial indications in FY08 that it may increase further. It remains,
however, quite l o w by the standards o f the E C A Region and the Bank. The main impact
o f these delays i s less financial than o n effectiveness o f the program. The new CPS
establishes clear portfolio performance targets as one o f the benchmarks modulating the
level o f lending support and proposes to accelerate portfolio restructuring, simplify
project design, emphasize greater client ownership, and deepen the move towards country
systems in reflection o f the lessons learned during the FY03-07 CAS.

IFC Lending
89.
IFC lending provided an important source of financing for the private sector,
and early evaluations suggest positive development implications. During the CAS
period, I F C invested $681 m i l l i o n o f i t s own funds in private sector companies in
Ukraine and mobilized $263 m i l l i o n in additional private sector financing toward a total
o f 28 investment projects. This lending supported the implementation o f a broad range o f
greenfield, modernization, and expansion projects by IFC’s private sector clients in
agribusiness, power distribution, construction materials, retail, logistics, hotel, and steel
sectors worth $2.4 billion. The portfolio i s very strong with n o non-performing loans.
Although the majority o f the projects under this CAS have not reached operating maturity
for proper evaluation, the risk profile analysis carried out by CIR indicates that I F C took
justified risks in terms o f sector distribution but mitigated the sponsor, project type and
financial structure risks by prudent selection and sound structuring o f the deals. The few
projects that are mature enough to be evaluated show consistently high development
outcomes. IFC’s value added was particularly pronounced when i t supported emerging
strong local players in sectors where Ukraine has prospects for establishing a strong
competitive position.

Analytical and Advisory Activities
90.
The Bank delivered good, and sometimes outstanding, AAA products. The CAS
program for AAA was implemented satisfactorily, including amendments made during
the CPR.68 The themes covered by AAA work, such as competitiveness, fiscal space,
energy, poverty, and pensions, were highly relevant. The quality o f AAA was good or
outstanding, as the IEG Country Assistance Evaluation acknowledges. AAA products
facilitated the dialogue with government mainly around the adjustment agenda and
helped develop credible roadmaps in critical sectors like energy. The main areas that
received attention from AAA activities were:
See Table A3.5.

103

public sector management (PER, PEFA, CPAR; advice on debt management;
advice o n intergovernmental relations);
social sectors (pensions, poverty assessments, labor markets study, informal
reports o n education policy, review o f health sector and socio-economic
consequences o f HIV/AIDS), and
infrastructure and energy (transport study; coal sector note, reports on gas and
electricity sectors; note on impact o f increased energy prices; advice on
implementation o f Kyoto Protocol).
Analytical and advisory work was mainly utilized to (i)develop the dialogue w i t h the
government around certain policy areas and thus encourage its support in policy reforms
(pensions study, CEM, trade study, CPAR; GIS options study), (ii)inform the
government’s decisions (policy notes; note o n impact o f energy prices) and (iii)
underpin
lending (both adjustment and investment - e.g., in energy sector).

91.
A distinct feature of AAA program implementation during the previous CAS
was the shijit from core diagnostic AAA to more country-tailored and responsive
products. This included fast-response notes at the request from the government o n
selected policy issues, as well as informal reports (e.g., in the area o f intergovernmental
finance, education policy, and joint health sector review). In addition, the Bank
increasingly moved towards a programmatic mode o f AAA work, such as in the public
finance management area, or in the energy sector, in order to map out a sequence o f
reform measures with Bank support extended over the full period o f implementation.
92.
Table A3.5 shows the Bank mostly delivered its AAA program as was planned
in the CAS, although with some changes in terms o f topics covered (e.g., dropped TA o n
forestry and telecom; a planned development marketplace didn’t materialize). Moreover,
the AAA program experienced some slippages. Some activities completed over the CAS
period (poverty assessment, CPAR) were delivered much later than planned or have been
disseminated much later than completed (HIV/AIDS study; GIS options study).

Despite its overall high quality, AAA work could have had a greater impact.
The Bank used its AAA work mostly to enrich i t s dialogue with the authorities and to
improve the design o f i t s lending interventions. There is a need to make AAA work more
responsive to client demand, improve timeliness o f delivery and make the analytical work
more focused o n policy advice that can inform concrete decision making. In addition, the
Bank could use the results o f i t s analytical work to advocate for policy changes in areas
where there i s not yet a national consensus. With hindsight, more needs to be done to
reach out to a broader audience than the government.

105

94.
The Bank could also enhance its own learning from engagement with Ukraine.
As a large Middle Income Country (MIC) that s t i l l demands the full range o f Bank
services, Ukraine offers potentially important lessons for the Bank’s engagement in M I C
countries. The Bank should use opportunities for learning together with the client and
adjusting i t s service m i x accordingly more. Greater attention t o client needs and
demands would over time create opportunities to involve clients in disseminating lessons
from their experience o f working with the Bank to other M I C clients in the region and
outside.
95.
IFC’s advisory services performed well in addressing broad private sector
development challenges and specific client needs. IFC’s advisory operations under this
C A S that have been evaluated were found to be strong o n all performance indicators,
including development effectiveness and overall work quality. Success drivers included
project strategic relevance, timeliness, and structure. The majority o f these projects are
n o w leading t o a series o f follow-up operations that have built on their success and
expertise. Advisory services linked to particular I F C investments show high success
rates as well, addressing specific needs o f committed clients and logically lending
themselves to consultant engagements.
Results Framework

96.
The focus on results benefited both the design and implementation of the CAS.
The FY03-FY07 CAS helped pilot the results-based approach t o CASs in the Bank. With
hindsight, the road map presented in the results matrix was a useful guide for the policy
dialogue and adjustment. The linkage with investment operations was weaker. Future
designs may benefit from a stronger linkage between policy-based lending and
investment operations.
The design of the indicators was satisfactory. The drafting o f the expected
97.
development outcomes under the CAS was precise and most indicators were
benchmarked. The CPR took stock o f the path to results by mid-term. The advent o f a
new government raised expectations that the pace o f implementation would pick up and
therefore the CPR did not adjust the results matrix. With hindsight, perhaps this should
have been done. In some cases, the proposed indicators were not developed (governance,
technology, legal alignment with Europe, etc.) making i t difficult to track impact. The
next strategy should pay greater attention t o the measurement and tracking o f results. A
more direct dialogue on the tracking o f results with government i s also advisable.

Field Presence
98.
The increased presence o f the Bank in Ukraine has made it possible to provide
timely assistance to the government. This presence also permits to maintain a continuous
policy dialogue and make progress in the development and implementation o f sector
agendas, as has been the case in the energy sector. However, country presence is a
necessary but not a sufficient condition for effectiveness, as experience in other sectors
shows.

106

W o r k i n g with Successive Governments

99.
Political developments affected implementation of the reform agenda the CAS
supported. The CAS was implemented during the tenure o f four different governments,
and included periods o f substantial political change, including the events that became
known as the “Orange Revolution”. Arguably, political uncertainty diverted attention
from reform. Moreover, the move to European institutions i s not as powerful an
incentive in Ukraine as in Central Europe where there was a concrete accession
perspective. Deepening integration with the European U n i o n continues to attract broad
national support, including across the political spectrum, albeit more recently with a
greater sense o f realism and a sense that societal and institutional change in Ukraine will
take time.
100. Progress was made in areas where political consensus existed or was forged.
Across the political spectrum, there i s consensus o n issues such as fiscal discipline,
emphasis o n social expenditures, accession to WTO, and energy security and efficiency.
Shared priorities helped achieve results. The opposite has been the case in areas o f
discrepancy-for
instance, in privatization, pension and social assistance reform,
corporate governance, etc. In areas o f high consensus, the Bank can play a productive
role in providing knowledge and technical assistance as well as resources. In areas o f
limited consensus, the WBG can play an advocacy role supported by good analytical
work.

101. Overall the quality of governance has improved in the country, but still remains
a major development challenge. Indicators such as the World Bank Development
Institute Governance Indicators track major progress in government effectiveness, the
quality o f regulation and the control o f corruption. The intended Bank support to scale
up engagement with c i v i l society did not develo as expected. On the other hand, the
situation in 2006 is strikingly different from 1998.89 The political events o f 2004 brought
about improvements in voice and accountability-with
greater transparency (freedom o f
the media, economic policy, and government information). Thus, i t i s in the area o f c i v i l
engagement where the greater progress in the country was made, even if the agenda the
Bank intended to implement did not h l l y take off.

102. Still, there is the perception that governance issues represent a major constraint
in the use o f public resources, the environment for
in critical sectors-effectiveness
business, corporate governance, and corruption. In summary, while Ukraine ranks
relatively w e l l in the context o f CIS countries, i t lags peer countries in Central Europe
and at similar levels o f income.

69

Ukraine improved its ranking in all o f the six WBI governance indicators from 1998 to 2006. Still, i t ranks below
50 percent (amongst the sample countries) in all o f the six indicators. Of the six indicators, voice and
accountability provides the best performance, reflecting more freedom o f the press and a more active civil society.
By contrast, Ukraine ranks lowest-despite improvements-in control o f corruption and the rule o f law. In these
two rankings, Ukraine in 2006 scarcely ranks above 25 percent o f countries in the sample.

107

VI.

LESSONS

103. Institutionally capable and committed national agencies increase the likelihood
of implementation effectiveness. The Central Bank, the M o F and the energy complex
are capable, committed agencies that get things done. In such cases, although it m a y take
time to reach agreement, prospects for successful implementation are high. Weak
institutions are less likely to implement agreements even if there i s a high level o f formal
“ownership.”
This partly explains the difficulties with advancing progress o n social
issues and in the environment. Understanding the capacity o f country authorities helps to
realistically assess the likelihood o f implementation.
However, the capacity to
implement i s not fixed and can increase through strong political mandates, good
leadership and institutional reform. It can also deteriorate.
104.

Linkages across themes reinforce the effectiveness of interventions. This
review has shown h o w a keen understanding o f the linkages across themes can help
advance reform and produce results. Improving payments and fiscal discipline has
helped make further progress in the financial and the energy sectors. In addition, the
focus o n linkages between energy and the environment (Kyoto and “green energy”) has
already produced positive results. By contrast, the linkage between fiscal programming
and expenditure (“social sectors”) remains highly undeveloped. Likewise, the linkages
between delivery o f social services and fiscal approaches to decentralization, despite
some attempts, remain insufficiently articulated.

105. Effectiveness requires not only a clear vision, including expected results, but an
understanding of the remedies to remove the barriers to achieve them. This review has
shown that clear objectives are not enough to achieve results. The complicated and often
non-transparent political economy o f Ukraine stalled progress in several areas. These
include lending to municipalities, pension reform, governance o f public and private
enterprises, privatization, creation o f a unified property registry, social assistance reform,
service delivery, etc. In most o f these areas, those who hold formal mandates often do
not have the political mandate. This i s not surprising in countries o f the former Soviet
U n i o n where by design there was a divorce between policy decision making and
execution. The tendency to concentrate policy decision-making at the top will continue
in the absence o f a deeper reform o f the state.
106.

A broad agenda risks wide variability of results. The 2003 CAS agenda was
broad because it endeavored to cover most aspects o f the government program. The price
has been a wide variability o f results. It was simply not possible to deal with all o f the
issues thoroughly, with limited country and Bank resources. With hindsight, greater
selectivity would have helped improve the quality o f the overall delivery. Selectivity
requires putting in place rules o f engagement and disengagement and enforcing them.
Flexibility helps move in areas o f opportunity and drop slow-moving agendas.

107. Achieving results demands sustained efforts that combine the use of various
instruments. Although there may be cases o f quick wins, in most circumstances,
progress came about through a combination o f intensive dialogue supported by analytical
work and adjustment, and, in a few cases, investment. Marginal or exploratory efforts
without explicit disengagement after a trial period or persistent follow-through can lead

108

to inflated expectations o f Bank assistance and divert resources from areas with higher
potential impact.

VII.

MOVING
FORWARD

108. The Bank should adopt greater selectivity in its strategy approach, targeting a
limited set of thematic areas that exploit synergies and at the same time provide for
greaterfocus. The strategy for FY08 to FY 11 should focus on k e y themes that cut across
the board and avoid narrow sector approaches. I t should also be selective in the themes
for full engagement. Taking a long-term perspective helps achieve selectivity by
postponing interventions that are not ready. A selective and prioritized agenda helps
focus Bank and country resources o n achieving substantive results rather dispersed
incremental gains. Selectivity, however, i s a challenge because the pace o f progress has
differed substantially across sectors. Interventions are likely to be more effective in areas
with clearly defined agendas and with more solid institutions; however, lack o f progress
in lagging reform areas can drag down other agendas.70 A partnership with Ukraine
would best combine interventions in areas with strong delivery potential with a presence
in key strategic arenas where progress has lagged. An open dialogue based on quality
analytical work and a good understanding o f the linkages/synergies across initiatives
should help partners to evaluate trade-offs.
109. Allow for flexibility in program design. The Bank should follow a flexible
approach mixing adjustment and investment lending. Demand for adjustment i s likely to
continue into the medium t e r m as an instrument to signal the country’s commitment to
modern market institutions t o the international community. In this regard, adjustment can
be a powerful instrument to drive institutional change. Still, the demand may shift
overtime, depending o n the need for resources and shifts in priorities. Within the
adjustment framework, partners should keep an open mind as to whether to continue with
the broad umbrella operations as in the past or to target sector issues more narrowly to
provide the leverage needed to unblock persistent constrains. While policy-based lending
remains the best option to achieve institutional reform, care must be taken not to overload
adjustment operations. The potential contribution o f AAA work to drive reforms forward
could be better exploited, including through advocacy work. Lastly, the next strategy
should avoid rigid programming over time and follow instead a rolling business plan
approach. A two year program could be designed and then updated at mid-term review.

Lagging areas that need attention are: (a) private and public corporate governance; (b) regulatory
compliance costs for business; (c) public expenditure management-ntry
point to: fiscal space for
investment, social sector reform; and decentralization; (d) social sector reform, and (e) reform o f the state.
Poor corporate governance will slow down financial sector deepening, economic diversification, and the
competitiveness o f the economy. A lagging small and medium enterprise sector reduces the dynamism o f
the economy. Lack o f attention to budgetary issues and the need for increased effectiveness o f public
expenditures i s likely to delay service delivery improvements. Improved service delivery has to take stock
o f the role and performance o f the local governments. Shortcomings in capital budgeting w i l l cut short
efforts to open fiscal space. Hence, attention to the laggard sectors cannot be avoided.
70

109

110. Evaluate the likelihood of implementation before undertaking significant
commitments. Clarity o f objectives, direct evaluation o f ownership and technical
capacity o f implementing authorities, and a sense o f the political economy behind a
particular reform roadmap are essential if the Bank i s to be effective in contributing to the
country’s development objectives. In some cases, the emphasis should be o n capacity
building; in other cases, the Bank can play a positive role by tilting the balance o f
political interests towards reform.

111. Make investment interventions work Without functioning investment projects,
the scope for delivering results narrows. The recommendations o f the 2005 review o f
investment lending remain valid. Attention to improving internal procedures in Ukraine-the emphasis o f the last CAS--should be complemented by extending recent increased
discipline on the Bank’s side concerning preparation time, effectiveness delays, project
extensions, etc. A shift towards implementation agencies outside the central government
(e.g., energy companies) may favor implementation success, but such an approach leaves
open the question o f how to assist with building institutions at the central levels. In
addition, a tighter alignment o f investment operations with government priorities and
institutional and budgetary processes, and with the adjustment agenda helps bolster
ownership, as do improvements in capital budgeting and greater use o f country systems.

112. The WBG should strengthen cooperation amongst its agencies and with the
donor community. The expanding role o f the I F C calls for greater harmonization with
the Bank in achieving common results. Coordination between the WBG and other donors
is also critical to various strategic agendas. A competitiveness agenda requires not only
harmonization and cooperation within the WBG but working with others, like the
European institutions, which will also likely help advance the governance agenda. The
Millennium Challenge Corporation i s likely to become a more prominent participant as
well.
113. Broaden the dialogue on transition. The emphasis o n demand for institutions
and better governance continues to be valid. For the donor community to be effective the
dialogue must extend outside the government to include parliament, local authorities,
c i v i l society, interest groups and the poor. In this regard, the dissemination o f the results
o f economic and sector work should a priority. Ukraine has an open political system and
a free press, which can contribute to debates on strategic choices.
114. Enhance efforts for two-way learning. While the Bank aims to bring a
combination o f knowledge and lending services to Ukraine and Ukraine’s current rapid
economic development is likely t o make knowledge services more important during the
coming CPS, there are also opportunities for the Bank to learn from its engagement in
Ukraine, which need to be used more effectively. Greater attention t o client demand and
ownership would further enhance operational returns to such two-way learning.

2003-2007 EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSE

IEG Recommendation

Management Response

Strategy. The Bank strategy should strive for greater
selectivity, focusing o n public financial
management, PSD, energy, and social protection,
and within these areas, on improving governance and
institutional development.

ESW. The Bank should be placing greater emphasis

The new CPS will propose greater selectivity for
Bank interventions, as part o f a Bank Group (not
Bank-only) engagement strategy.
b Consistent with Ukraine’s M I C status, the focus
areas o f engagement w i l l be determined following
discussion with the government, and not by Bank
management alone.
1 The CPS will propose a more programmatic
engagement, with programs representing a flexible
mix o f policy-based and investment lending,
AAA, and partnerships.
b The CPS will build on the extensive work already
underway in GAC, and will articulate specific
additional cross-cutting initiatives.

than in the past on private sector development and
infrastructure.

Investment lending. A tighter alignment is needed
between investment projects and the government
priorities. In addition, the Bank should simplify
investment projects and reduce their scale to match
implementation capacity, and ensure line ministries’
engagement in project preparation, and also their
more direct involvement in project implementation,
avoiding off-line PIUs.
Adjustment lending. A shift from broad, multisectoral loans to loans that are more narrowly
focused and disbursed in single tranche i s
appropriate for Ukraine, which would also provide
the opportunity for follow up and deeper policy and
institutional reforms.

AAA work w i l l be determined by agreement with
the government, consistent with the overall CPS
approach noted above. I t will include provision to
respond to borrower demand, and w i l l be
programmatic rather than sectoral in definition.
Consistent with the increased emphasis on
infrastructure noted in the 2005 CAS Progress
Report, additional investment w i l l be made in
infiastructure AAA.
Broader programs aligned with government
priorities will drive the selection o f investment
projects. Investment project delivery w i l l be
increasingly aligned with Ukrainian institutional
processes, while carefully managing associated
fiduciary risks, Use o f PIUs i s declining, and this
w i l l continue.
The shift to more focused, single tranche
operations i s already underway. The CPS will
elaborate how this shift will continue within the
context o f more programmatic engagement that
seeks to balance the need for focus with the crosssectoral nature o f many o f the reforms that
remain.

ANNEX 5: CPS PRINCIPLES AND OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR SELECTION OF PROGRAMS

1. Three principles underlie the development of the CPS: (i) selectivity, (ii)
flexibility, and (iiipartnerships.
)
Selectivity

2.
I n moving towards greater selectivity in Bank activities in the next strategy
period, a framework for the selection of programs was developed as part of the CPS
preparation. Three criteria were established to inform the selection:
0

0

0

Client ownership: the Bank’s activities should respond t o the demands o f the
client in order to be effective.
Development urgency: to the extent that particular development challenges stand
out, the Bank should be willing to support measures to address these challenges.
This may or may not coincide with the priorities o f the client.
World Bank’s comparative advantage: this criteria encompasses the Bank’s
current capacity to address a specific issue, and the related potential needs for
investment in diagnostic work or in staff skills, as well as the role other donors are
playing in a particular area.

3.

In the implementation of this framework, the diversity of comparative
advantages among various W o r l d Bank Group institutions needs to be taken into
consideration. Because I F C responds to the needs o f private sector clients in addition to
the government and its comparative advantage may differ from that o f IBRD in meeting
their needs, the classification o f programs according to the criteria above may be different
for the two institutions. Specifically, due to a different set o f instruments at its disposal
(ability to provide direct financing to the private sector) and a vast experience focusing
specifically on private sector development, I F C may be better positioned to take the lead
o n addressing the challenges faced by the private sector clients, while IBRD would
predominantly apply i t s competencies in the public domain.

4.
Based on the rules for selectivity presented above, a typology of
programmatic interventions was developed depending upon which criteria they
fulfill (Figure A.4.1). At the intersection o f the three perspectives o f client demand,
urgency o f need and Bank capacity to lead are the “core programs”. At the intersection
o f client demand and urgency o f need, but where a reform path (or the Bank’s capacity to
lead) remains to be fully developed, are the “development programs”. At the intersection
o f urgency o f need and Bank capacity, where client demand i s limited are the “advocacy
programs3771.

71 The

notion o f client demand i s naturally quite subjective. Client demand may not be uniform depending
o n who in the Government one talks to. What matters for selectivity i s that there i s clear and expressed
demand for engagement from the central authorities, in particular the MoF, the Ministry o f Economy, the
Cabinet o f Ministers and the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for the Economic Block.

128

Figure A.4.1: Selectivity in the CPS
Urgency of Need
Development

Core Program

Comparative Advantage
Advocacy Program

5.
Core programs combine a range o f instruments, including investment and
adjustment lending, a n d AAA targeted towards specific needs that have already been
identified as part o f an overall reform patldagenda. Core programs are programs, where
basic strategic AAA has already been carried out and a reform path has thus been
developed. The Bank is therefore in a position to bring its full support to bear o n this
area and to do this based o n a reform strategy owned and supported by the client. Core
programs are also expected to benefit from synergies across different thematic
engagements and instruments.

6.
Development programs w o u l d typically n o t include investment lending
(although they might include one f i r s t “door-opening” operation). Development
programs would be expected to be AAA heavy, with significant spending on the
development o f a reform roadmap and investment into a sequenced policy agenda that
might be supported by adjustment. AAA may include basic ESW, but would be expected
to also include targeted policy notes, selected pieces o f advocacy work and the
mobilization o f technical assistance.

7.
Advocacy programs w o u l d n o t include investment o r adjustment lending a n d
w o u l d b e d r i v e n entirely by M A . Since the purpose i s to advocate for reform where
client ownership i s limited but the Bank judges development urgency to be high, these
programs would include substantial outreach efforts to society at large.
8.
T h e f r a m e w o r k f o r selectivity among thematic areas will b e complemented in
the new Strategy with a move towards fewer, larger a n d m o r e efficient investment
lending operations. The CPS foresees n o more than four lending operations each year,
o f which one is planned to be a DPL. The remaining three investment lending operations
are expected to be concentrated in the core programs o f the strategy. In addition, the CPS
aims to bring preparation and implementation times down from current high levels.
Success in doing so will be one o f the benchmarks modulating the level o f assistance in
the CPS (see below).
9.
IFC investments a n d advisory services will complement IBRD lending a n d
non-lending activities across a l l three types o f programs. In response to strong
demand from the private sector and the government, I F C is planning to scale up i t s

129

operations by i)extending direct loans to private companies, ii)exploring opportunities to
mobilize direct private investment as co-financing for public projects, and iii)providing
advisory services for broad-based improvements in the business environment, corporate
company practices, and supply chains. Through i t s operations, I F C would support the
demand for policy change and create positive demonstration effects in the private sector.
I F C would also aim to reach the relatively poorer regions in the west and south o f
Ukraine as well as underserved segments o f the private sector, where the availability o f
financing and expertise has been limited to date. Due attention will be dedicated to
ensuring to development effectiveness and long-term sustainability o f I F C interventions.

10.

T h e concentration on fewer lending operations and the reduction of
preparation and implementation timetables will set free administrative resources
for advisory services but also for advocacy and communication work. A key
principle o f the CPS is that the Bank’s engagement in Ukraine should become more
programmatic and less oriented towards the preparation o f investment projects. The
greater focus o n AAA activities will see investment in greater dissemination and
communication efforts. In this regard, a renewed engagement with c i v i l society will be a
key plank o f the Bank’s governance strategy in Ukraine and reflects the views o f nongovernment stakeholders, which have encouraged the Bank to provide a forum for debate
o n key development and social issues.

11.

An additional benefit of the increased focus on non-lending activities i s that it
generates positive knowledge spillovers for other B a n k clients. Ukraine’s experience
as a fast-growing middle income country and its need to innovate institutionally t o adapt
existing world practice to i t s specific circumstances could benefit other countries likely to
follow a similar path. The Bank’s global knowledge can help Ukraine, but Ukraine’s
specific experience will also enrich the Bank’s global knowledge. In reflection o f this
two-way learning, non-lending activities where possible will be carried out jointly with
local partners, and opportunities sought to share Ukraine’s expertise with other countries
in the region.
The cross-sectoral DPL will continue, but here too conditionality will become
12.
more selective. Policy conditionality will aim for a realistic assessment o f reform
progress and focus attention on those areas where reforms are most urgent but also
success i s most likely. The DPL-11, prepared in parallel with this new CPS, continues a
cross-sectoral focus in order to maintain a broad anchor for the policy dialogue during a
time o f increased uncertainty. The program contains reform benchmarks for one
additional policy operation in the series, which would bring to a close several important
reform agendas initiated under the PAL program in the 2000-2003 and 2003-2007 CASs.
Beyond the DPL 111, the CPS leaves open the possibility o f a move towards more
thematically focused DPLs if the government sees benefits in deepening the policy
engagement and support in a particular area (see Section V I on CPS pillars).
Flexibility

13.
As a MIC, Ukraine requires a flexible menu o f support. The current CPS does
not develop a full lending pipeline or a complete business plan for the entire four-year
period. Instead, consistent with Ukraine’s status as a lower middle income country with

130

significant implementation and fiduciary risks, and inherent country uncertainties, a twoyear lending and AAA program is specified, while activities in the outer years o f the CPS
would be discussed and finally agreed during the mid-term review o f the strategy after
two years.

14.
Flexibility in the CPS applies to both themes and instruments. The choice o f
programs can be reviewed at mid-term and some development or advocacy programs
may have matured enough to qualify for focused investment lending support in the
subsequent period. Other core programs may have failed to live up to expectations and
the scope o f the Bank’s support may be reduced. The decision whether to move from
cross-sectoral to thematic DPLs would also be part o f the review process at mid-term.
15.
The greater focus on AAA activities raises significant challenges to be
addressed in the course of implementation of this CPS, including:
(i)Increased responsiveness to client demand in the selection o f topics for AAA;
(ii)
Developing a results framework for AAA to strengthen accountability;
(iii)Cooperation and co-funding o f k e y analytical work with other donors;
(iv) Exploring fee-for-service arrangements with the Government at various levels
to allow AAA to be scaled up.
16.
One specific proposal s t i l l in the process of discussion with the authorities i s
the creation of an “Innovation Fund” that would bundle AAA resources and make
them available for demand-driven analytical and advisory services. The authorities
have so far not indicated interest in fee-for-service arrangements as in Russia or
Kazakhstan. However, the creation o f such an Innovation Fund that would contain
perhaps initially up to US$400-500,000 in administrative budget could lay the basis for
subsequent co-financing. Co-financing from other donors, including Ukrainian charitable
foundations, will also be explored.
Partnerships and Harmonization

17.
Since 2006, the WBG has been overtaken by the combined European
institutions (EBRD, the EC, and the EIB) as the largest provider of official
development assistance to Ukraine. The Action Plan agreed with the EU sets a
framework for reform in many areas o f interest for the Bank. Other large donors are
USAID (with a very significant program in the development o f capital markets and
financial services, for instance), the Millennium Challenge Corporation, C I D A (the
leading provider o f finance for the People’s Voice project), the Swedish International
Development Association (SIDA) (with a keen interest in environment), as w e l l as Dutch,
German and Japanese bilateral assistance (all currently involved as co-financiers or as
donors to Bank-managed trust funds in Ukraine). Close coordination is therefore
imperative. Annex 6 provides an overview o f donor activities by thematic area.

18.
Coordination with partners has implications for selectivity. On the one hand,
i t i s possible that the Bank may be asked by the donor community to take the lead in a
particular area because i t has the greatest expertise or because other donors are not
currently present in it. O n the other hand, the Bank may decide not to be active in a
particular sector because i t i s crowded by other donors and the Bank’s value added i s not

131

immediately obvious. But there are also many areas in which donors complement each
other and the presence o f partners may increase the returns to the Bank’s investments. In
deciding which areas to focus on, the Bank needs to take these considerations into
account.

19.
T h e importance of the donor community in influencing policy choices in
Ukraine should not be over-estimated. Combined donor assistance (including EBRD
lending to the public sector) may currently be in the order o f US$1- 1.5 billion per annum,
which i s around 1 percent o f GDP, or 2.5 percent o f total government revenues.
However, donor assistance i s a much larger proportion o f Ukraine’s capital budget.

20.

Compared to the size of financial transfers, the transaction costs for Ukraine
of dealing with the donor community are high. Despite a commitment to harmonize
aid procedures, coordinate o n policies, and avoid duplication, the donor community
remains relatively fragmented in Ukraine. M a n y donor assistance projects bypass the
budget, are implemented under special procedures from procurement to financial
management, and require the Ukrainian side to set up costly project management
functions which are not well integrated into existing government ministries and agencies.
A perceived high level o f fiduciary risks limits the extent to which donors are willing to
move fully towards the adoption o f country systems. However, the current parallel
processes are not only costly and fail to build adequate government capacity, but also
contribute to the fragmentation o f the capital budget system itself.
Individual
government agencies are given a license to chase after their o w n assistance projects
without these having been reviewed against a set o f strategic priorities.

21.
Improved coordination will require government leadership. But the Bank
will continue to explore avenues for greater harmonization o f i t s procedures with
those of Ukraine and encourage other partners to follow the same route as one of
the main tools to force greater coordination from the government’s side. Key
milestones o f the CPS in this regard include routing all project disbursements through the
State Treasury, including W o r l d Bank projects in the state budget, and improvements in
the state procurement system. Over the medium-term, the Bank will work on a
framework for assistance to specific sector programs through the budget and tied to
meeting specific performance benchmarks. The EU i s also working o n a framework for
sector budget support, providing a good opportunity for donor collaboration. This could
evolve into a series o f SWAPS in the outer years o f the CPS.

ANNEX 8: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS
1.
The goal o f public consultations in Kyiv and regions was to discuss the general
directions of the proposed Bank strategy for Ukraine, as well as specific programs and
instruments. Bank staff met with about 300 representatives o f NGOs, academia,
professional associations, think-tanks, business circles, parliamentarians, members o f
local governments and mass media. Background materials (briefing notes, presentations)
were prepared and distributed in advance o f the discussions. The draft CPS was
published o n the web to solicit public feedback and comments.

2.

The summary o f discussions and comments is presented below.

Progress of Reforms in Ukraine

3.

The implementation o f reforms in Ukraine was a thorough issue o f all the
discussions. Following are the main comments and messages received:
The participants felt that reforms are not yet noticeable, in particular in
improvement o f people’s lives.
There i s public disillusionment in the reforms process and decrease in public trust
in the authorities.
I t was noted that public involvement is not customary in Ukraine and c i v i l society
should be stimulated and encouraged to participate, especially at the local level.

There were also specific grievances expressed o n particular government policies,
including (i)the quasi exchange rate peg, which had led to the rising cost o f
imports (due to depreciation o f the UAH against the Euro), (ii)
the increase in
energy tariffs combined with a lack o f transparency over use o f the resulting
additional revenues and (iii)
the administration and lack o f transparency o f the

VAT.
Good Governance and Anti Corruption

4.
Good governance and anti-corruption i s a topic which cuts across themes and was
mentioned during all discussions, as i t i s perceived as the major obstacle to the country’s
development. Following are the main comments and suggestions received:
The causes for corruption are deeply rooted and further aggravated by l o w c i v i l
servant salaries, the fall in living standards o f the population, and the general
disregard o f the law. The laws are in place but their implementation i s lax and
there are many loopholes that encourage violations.
Another reason for rampant corruption i s said to be the apathy o f the population
and its somewhat indifferent attitude toward unlawful practices. Most people
would rather pay a bribe than report violations or file complaints.
Corruption is permeating through the whole bureaucratic state machinery. The
only way to reduce it is to reform the state bureaucracy according to the modern
standards.
Corruption i s spreading out in Ukraine because there are a number o f laws and
legal provision that are designed in such a way that behaving in accordance with

147

the law i s simply not possible and since a legal violation i s inevitable the
threshold for bribery i s correspondingly reduced.
0

The following issues need to be addressed in the fight against corruption:
regulatory reform; strict observance o f the existing laws; need to understand the
issue o f conflict o f interests, especially in business and politics; need for advocacy
and c i v i l education to make citizens aware o f their rights and voice in order to
prevent abuse by corrupt officials. The World Bank’s role i s mostly seen as
providing advice, public education and advocacy, and assistance in the structural
reforms, especially in the administrative and c i v i l service reform.

Human Development

5.
Participants o f the consultations pointed out that the CPS should put an emphasis
o n the improvement o f social services delivery. Reforms in education are also seen as a
priority area that could lead to the increasing competitiveness o f Ukraine. Following are
the specific comments received:
Improvement o f Ukraine’s education system i s the most critical issue for the
country and the WE3 should provide strong support in this area. Right n o w the
private sector development in Ukraine i s hampered by the lack o f well educated
and skilled professionals.
0

Youth unemployment i s increasing; university graduates do not have enough
necessary skills and knowledge t o enter the j o b market. The WB should help
Ukraine in improving standards in higher education.

0

In spite o f the proclaimed GDP growth, the l i f e o f Ukrainians i s not improving.
Public services do not reach those who need them. C i v i l servants have n o idea
h o w to serve people.

0

The WB should support development o f the non-state pension funds. For this
purpose, the mechanisms for the Ukrainian citizens should be developed in order
to accumulate funds for their pensions, and the relevant information campaign
should be launched. Maybe creation o f the regional funds is worth considering,
because they are more trusted by the local population.

0

The NGOs stressed that demand for reforms and for high quality services should
stem from the people and NGOs should help mobilize society to that end.

0

C i v i l society/government cooperation i s seen as imperative in the provision o f
social services and implementing the social reforms.

0

Improvement o f demographic situation is another area for possible W o r l d Bank
support through improvement o f quality o f health and heath services delivery.

0

Transition to healthy lifestyle should be one o f the national priorities. The W o r l d
Bank could contribute to this agenda by pushing the government to take serious
measures to address this issue especially among the youth.

Environment

6.
Environment was discussed at the regional meetings in Lviv, Kharkiv and Kyiv.
Some written comments were also received from the environmental NGOs. The N G O s

148

believe that Ukraine should bring i t s environmental protection policy and practice in
correspondence with EU standards. Following are the NGOs' recommendations:

As far as the new CPS is concerned, the NGOs would l i k e to see a greater
emphasis o n the environmental protection, linking it to the improvement in the
quality o f peoples' lives.
Ukraine faces the problem o f informing the public about the ecological situation.
The WB should initiate the full and free access to environmental information in
Ukraine.

The WB should support introduction o f the most ecologically safe technologies,
especially in small towns and push the government to allocate more funds for
nature conservation.
The WB could help by providing small grants for village and small town
communities to solve the waste management problems, also for construction o f
small electric power stations. Quite a few problems can be solved if communities
are energy independent.
0

The WB m a y help establish the institutions for environmental examination
without government's support since the government gains nothing from such
activity.

0

NGOs would like t o promote environmental education at schools and look to
support from the WB.

Agriculture

7.

Agriculture i s still suffering from the "Soviet Style" management. The financial
support form the Bank should go to these areas only after k e y political decisions are
being made by the new parliament and new government. The WB's involvement in the
agriculture sector would be very difficult as less economy but more politics are present.
Infrastructure

The Bank's involvement in infrastructure has been discussed during practically all
8.
meetings. Some participants see this issue as a top priority for Ukraine; others don't
believe that Bank support i s necessary as the sector already enjoys investments from the
private entities:
The WB should invest in development o f infi-astructure, including water supply
and sewerage systems, and construction o f solid waste storages, especially in
small towns.
0

0

Bearing in mind the specific geographical location o f Ukraine (between the East
and the West), it i s theoretically possible to earn millions o f dollars by means o f
transit. The WB should consider supporting this area.
One o f the priorities o f infrastructure development in the V o l y n region i s
construction o f the checkpoint o n the Polish border, including motels, relevant
services, etc. The building i s planned for the next 2-3 years, and it i s possible,
with the help o f the WB, to make a model o f this border corridor and t o make
forecasts o f the future cargo and human flows, amount o f investment required,
and the possible period o f investments return.

149

The proposed CPS envisages support to already “financially rich” areas infrastructure, energy, transport. They do not need such support and the
assistance should be targeted toward ‘socially oriented’ programs.
The water supply infrastructure in Ukraine i s in poor condition and suffers from
non-transparent and poor management. One o f the ways to improve it would be
the replacement o f the existing system with the private mini-water supply
facilities.

Business Environment

9.

This i s the area where the Bank, through the IFC, has been conducting extensive
consultations with the business community for several years. Regular meetings with
businesses and business associations, round tables and conferences, have helped to
develop the deregulation program supported by the Bank as well as to give a greater
voice to the business community in their demand for a better business environment.
During the CPS discussions, entrepreneurs mentioned that:
Removing obstacles for private business development i s essential to increase
Ukraine’s competitiveness and sustained economic growth.
Improvement o f the environment for doing business i s the only way to create a
real middle class in Ukraine.
The Bank should continue facilitating the dialogue between the government and
the business community in order to achieve stable business laws and good legal
protection o f businesses.
The legislative framework for business requires an in-depth analysis and adequate
systematic changes that will meet present-day challenges.
The Bank should pay more attention to training o f entrepreneurs and enterprise
managers; introduction o f innovations; elaboration o f the development strategy
and bringing the Ukrainian information standards in line with the European
norms.
The WBG m a y promote building partnership between authorities and business by
organizing forums and providing a platform for such a dialogue.
The W o r l d Bank and IFC should put some efforts in promoting positive image o f
entrepreneurship in the Ukrainian society.

Regional Development and Local Self-Governance

10.
During public consultations, irrespectively o f the topic and audience, many o f the
participants expressed a strong view that support to the regional development and local
self-governance reform should be in the center o f the WBG agenda in Ukraine. The k e y
views are presented below:
In addition to working with the central government, the Bank should support
programs at the local level. Such programs could produce tangible results as
people at the local level are much more responsible and have a very concrete
interest in achieving project success.

Village, settlement or district councils can not maintain themselves as they do not
have the budgets that would enable them to satisfy their needs by 100 percent.

150

With the tax legislation currently in force, it i s almost impossible t o change the
situation.
The WB has t o persuade the government that it is needed to extend the powers o f
local governments while trying to strengthen local budgets.
The WB should support public finance reform to allow local governments
borrowing money under regional guarantees.
The local government should not receive the reallocated funds from the state
budget. Instead, it would be better to establish a more efficient system o f local
budget receipts. The state should finance only the national programs essential for
national defense, security and transport. As far as the local programs are
concerned, they must be supported by properly defined financing sources.
The Bank should promote an introduction o f real estate tax that will be for the
benefit o f local government as this tax could provide additional local budget
financing.

The Role of the NGOs
11.
All NGOs expressed a desire to become partners o f the Bank. They specifically
mentioned that:
The WB should resume dialogue with the c i v i l society that was so active and
successful a few years ago, and should pay more attention t o the opinion and
views o f the c i v i l society.
The Bank should also provide a platform for c i v i l society organization for open
public debates o n the government policy.
0

The NGO could play a special role in “increasing public knowledge” about the
Government initiatives; in increasing public participation through public hearings,
information dissemination, and preparation and distribution o f printed material; as
well as in monitoring the implementation o f government policy decisions that
impact the society.
The civil society organizations should become major partners o f the World Bank
in implementing Governance and Anti-corruption agenda.

0

T o influence the authorities and the decision-making in Ukraine the civil society
organizations should have the respective rights. The World Bank role is seen t o
lobby for empowerment o f the c i v i l society in Ukraine.

0

The new CPS would benefit from introducing mechanisms o f public and c i v i l
society control over the implementation o f the Bank projects in Ukraine as well as
over the government policy decisions.
The CPS should envisage assistance from the WBG for the development o f the
capacity o f NGOs, through supporting the development o f their infrastructure as
well as supporting their program activities (especially their research programs and
programs directed at work with the public).

Advocacy and Public Informatiom

12.
The issue o f public understanding o f critical issues o f Ukraine’s development, as
well as public support to reforms, was highlighted during the consultations. The main
messages are summarized below:
0

The public has to understand reforms to make them successful. The WB should
initiate public information programs on various reform issues to build public
support to reforms.
The Bank should educate the media how to cover different aspects o f reforms
(e.g., in energy and infrastructure).
Within the new CPS cycle the WB should envisage broader dissemination o f
more comprehensible information about i t s projects, programs and development
issues as a whole.

Advocacy programs under the new CPS would be a critical tool to mobilize support o f
non-governmental stakeholders and stimulate public debates around issues urgent for the
development o f Ukraine; as well create public pressure on the government for delivering
on reforms.
