EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.

Honduras is a lower middle income country with broad macroeconomic, governance,
security and growth challenges. The country remains one of the poorest and most unequal
countries in Latin America. About half of the population of Honduras is rural, 80 percent of
which live in hillside areas practicing subsistence agriculture. The trend in poverty had been
one of gradual decline; however, poverty in Honduras may have risen by more than 150,000
people between 2009 and 2010 as a result of the economic contraction in 2009, before
starting to fall again slowly as growth recovers. Human development challenges persist,
particularly with regards to educational attainment, and a notable gender gap constitutes a
developmental imperative. Honduras is also one of the most at-risk countries to natural
hazards, and 1998’s Hurricane Mitch and subsequent storms have periodically battered the
national infrastructure.

ii.

On June 28, 2009, Honduras experienced a governance crisis when the Honduran
Supreme Court ordered the removal of President Zelaya. Porfirio Lobo from the
National Party won the November 2009 elections and, following a period of international
reconciliation, Honduras’ membership in the Organization of American States was restored.
The 2009 political crisis should be considered in the context of broader unresolved national
governance issues. Though Honduras has put forth several efforts in recent years aimed at
improving governance, progress has been slow and uneven.

iii.

The country is still recovering from the effects of the 2008-2009 global economic crisis
that negatively impacted the economy. The Honduran economy staged a moderate
recovery in 2010, with exports and public investment being the key drivers of growth. The
recovery was, however, accompanied by deterioration in the external balance and an increase
in inflation. The Government is committed to fiscal consolidation efforts and reducing public
sector vulnerabilities after the significant growth expenditures during the global crisis and the
period before President Lobo’s election.

iv.

Crime and violence is now one of the most important development challenges for
Honduras and the government has prioritized citizen security as its top priority. At
82.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2010 Honduras had the highest homicide rate in
the world. Weak governance, low growth, and poor social outcomes have contributed to a
more favorable environment for crime and violence that is attracting organized crime such as
narco-trafficking and youth gangs. The impact of these external stresses has been amplified
and exacerbated by the high prevalence of many of the risk factors that make individuals and
communities vulnerable to violence, largely a result of the weak and fragmented social safety
net system. The criminal justice system has been ineffective in its preventive, deterrence, or
punitive roles, weakened by the corrupting influence of organized crime, and thus
undermining good governance and the rule of law.

v.

An Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Honduras covered a 12-month period up to October
2011, following the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY07-10. The 2007-2010
World Bank Honduras CAS was executed under especially challenging circumstances. The
country experienced costly natural disasters, a food, fuel and global financial crisis, and
i

political conflict that was followed by President Manuel Zelaya’s removal from office in
2009 and a “pause” in the Bank’s portfolio while an assessment of conditions on the ground
was carried out in line with OP 7.30. Following resumption of the Bank’s assistance to
Honduras, an ISN was prepared and discussed by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors
on November 9, 2010. The ISN was completed successfully, setting the stage for moving to a
full Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
vi.

The World Bank Group has developed its 2012-2014 CPS to respond to the Honduras
Country Vision and National Plan, supported by the Lobo Administration. These
priorities center along the goals of: i) improving social investments and opportunities; ii)
crime and violence prevention; iii) social protection and reaching those in extreme poverty;
and iv) improving economic growth and modernizing state institutions.

vii.

The CPS will accompany the Government in developing actionable strategies aligned to
the national vision, through selective, strategic, and programmatic engagement. To do
so it will reorient the existing program toward key strategic objectives supporting the major
developmental priorities of the authorities, and will focus new engagement to reinforce these
objectives. Given the limited amount of IDA resources available to help address the
ambitious development agenda in Honduras, the implementation constraints that have been
observed over the years, and the lessons learned, this CPS will contribute to the national
development agenda in a strategic and selective way. Selectivity will be a major principle of
the CPS, with fewer, larger operations supported by programmatic approaches and
partnerships that leverage additional resources from other sources. Selectivity also means that
the CPS does not envisage new investment financing at this time in some areas where the
Bank has traditionally been providing financing, such as roads, education, or health.
The 2012-2014 CPS will focus on three strategic areas:

viii.

Strategic Objective One—Improving Citizen Security. The Bank’s proposed strategy
involves assisting the Government, within the Bank’s mandate, with building its capacity to
implement a multi-sectoral and integrated citizen security strategy at both the national and
local levels. First, the CPS aims to support the implementation of the National Citizen
Security and Coexistence Policy with a focus on social prevention programs and
strengthening the related governance structures. The Bank will also help build the antimoney laundering capacity of institutions and a base for better data on crime and violence.
Second, the Bank will help to develop and finance interventions to reduce the physical,
social, and economic exclusion of communities and municipalities where violence is high,
with the ultimate goal of making them more resilient to the consequences related to the
heightened levels of crime and violence. Third, key institutional capacity challenges across
Central America are impeding the implementation of an integrated approach to reducing
crime and violence. The Bank’s efforts in this area will be designed not only to increase
awareness, skills, and new implementation know-how, but also to inspire partnerships and
coalitions, and build consensus. The Bank will focus on developing approaches for raising
the skills of young people for improving employability and transition to the labor market.

ix.

Strategic Objective Two—Expanding Opportunities through Reducing Vulnerabilities.
This strategic objective defines both opportunities and vulnerabilities in an inclusive sense to
ii

comprise those of an economic, social, or climatic nature. While the CPS will support diverse
results contributing to this objective ranging from improved fiscal management, investment
climate, and competitiveness, to more effective disaster risk management, a large part of the
instruments will come from operations carrying over previous CAS period, especially in
terms of infrastructure investments. New lending envisaged under this CPS pillar at this time
will concentrate on a new programmatic series of DPCs. The CPS will also support actions
and results in the investment climate and creditworthiness that will help position Honduras in
the future for IBRD eligibility.
x.

Strategic Objective Three—Enhancing Good Governance. Though important reforms
were passed with support under the preceding CAS in the governance sector and projects met
their development objectives, many cross-cutting challenges persist, calling for a sustained
engagement in a broader framework on good governance. The Bank will continue to support
the modernization of public sector management systems and expects to continue its work and
contribute to results in several areas, including public financial management and service
delivery through municipal and other decentralized structures. This work will be
complemented by an effort to incorporate the findings of the 2009 IGR, including the need to
strengthen social accountability and the demand for good governance.

xi.

IFC will also continue to explore demand and expand its program in Honduras, focused
primarily on the financial sector, agribusiness, infrastructure, and more recently, engagement
with sub-national government entities. Possibilities will also be explored for assistance in the
creation of public-private partnerships for infrastructure and crime and violence prevention.

xii.

Possibility of transition to IBRD-IDA blend status. Honduras is positioning itself for a
possible transition in this CPS period from an IDA-only status to an IDA-IBRD blend status.
To this end, during the CPS period, IBRD will undertake a creditworthiness assessment
focusing on whether Honduras has built a consistent track record of macro management, has
developed a robust debt management capacity, and is committed and able to move ahead
with its core reform agenda. Should Honduras gain access to IBRD funds during the CPS
period, the Bank will return to the Board with a CPS Progress Report and modified strategy.

xiii.

Risks and risk mitigation. The CPS will face key risks in the areas of fiscal consolidation,
crime and violence, political economy, and the possibility of disasters. In each of these areas,
the Bank has identified approaches and instruments to help mitigate the risks. Nevertheless, it
is important to acknowledge that violence and crime are likely to continue to escalate. The
Bank’s approach will be to help the Government target impact through multi-faceted
interventions focused on prevention, and to bring about greater strategic coherence to bear on
this objective over time. Moreover, the Bank will need to closely observe the political
dynamics in the country and maintain an open dialogue with all political parties. The Bank
will also monitor implementation of its Program with attention to political economy
dimensions and periodically review with Government and others options in this regard.
Emphasis will be given to actions that support the enlargement of the pro-reform
constituencies with a focus on demand driven good governance initiatives.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
An Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Honduras covered a 12-month period up to
October 2011, following the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY07-10. The 20072010 World Bank Honduras CAS was executed under especially challenging circumstances.
The country experienced costly natural disasters, a food, fuel and financial crisis, and political
conflict followed by President Manuel Zelaya’s removal from office in 2009 and a “pause” in the
Bank’s portfolio while an assessment of conditions on the ground was carried out in line with OP
7.30. Following resumption of the Bank’s assistance to Honduras, an ISN was prepared and
discussed by the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on November 9, 2010 (Report No. 56405HN). The ISN was completed successfully, setting the stage for moving to a full Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS).
2.
The CAS Completion Report (see Annex 1) argues that despite these challenges, the
Bank’s performance during the preceding CAS and ISN periods was moderately
satisfactory, although the Program performance was moderately unsatisfactory. The Bank
undertook proactive action given the evolving political and economic conditions as well as
responding to a number of shocks, while also remaining focused on its engagement in several
strategic development areas, such as governance. The difficult economic, governance, social, and
political environment meant, however, that several of the CAS outcome targets were not
achieved and the impact of the CAS Program on the broader development outcomes of the
country has been mixed. Given limited local implementation capacity, moreover, greater
selectivity in identifying areas of Bank engagement under the CAS would also have likely led to
better performance of the lending portfolio.
3.
The proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) will cover the period FY12 to
FY14, a period likely to be marked with emerging opportunities and serious challenges, for
the following reasons:


Crime and violence. First, the citizen security agenda has acquired increasing significance in
Honduras as both a serious drag on economic growth and a socially destabilizing force.
Addressing it will need a strong, concerted and multi-pronged effort on the part of
Government, civil society, private sector, and the international development partners of
Honduras. This issue forms a cornerstone of the new CPS, with a package of Bank support
that will involve financing, knowledge products, capacity building, and convening services
within the international community. The Bank acknowledges, however, that while it has
relatively robust diagnostics and some experience and ideas of what to support, the Bank’s
work in this area is relatively new and concrete evidence of what works best in Honduras is
still being accumulated. Therefore the Bank will maintain a proactive monitoring policy in
order to make adjustments to the approach to citizen security in the CPS.



Political turmoil. The current administration has integrated actors from various political
factions under a “National Unity Government,” but challenges remain. The Government’s
success in delivering on national development priorities, as well as in conducting an orderly
hand-over of power through the electoral process in 2013, will be crucial to consolidating the
1

strength of Honduras’ framework for governance. The financial and technical assistance
under this CPS will be front-loaded to the extent possible to respond to both Government
demand and to increase the chance that projects initiate implementation promptly before a
new electoral cycle. In contrast, the latter months of this CPS are expected to be
overshadowed by the approaching political transition, constraining prospects of significant
institutional or legislative reform.


Possibility of transition to IBRD-IDA blend status. Honduras is positioning itself for a
possible transition in this CPS period from an IDA-only status to an IDA-IBRD blend status.
To this end, during the CPS period, IBRD will undertake a creditworthiness assessment
focusing on whether Honduras has built a consistent track record of macro management,
whether it has developed a robust debt management capacity, and whether it is committed
and able to move ahead with its core reform agenda. Should Honduras gain access to IBRD
funds during the CPS period, the Bank will return to the Board with a CPS Progress Report
and modified strategy.

4.
The proposed CPS is aligned with the Government’s development priorities and the
LCR and IFC Regional strategies. The strategic objectives of the CPS are to: (i) improve
citizen security; (ii) expand opportunities and reduce vulnerabilities (social, economic, and
climate); and (iii) enhance good governance. Lessons from the implementation of the previous
CAS have pointed to the need for greater selectivity in areas of lending engagement, a coherent
combination of lending and knowledge services which are programmatic, a more modest
approach in framing likely CPS results, and greater emphasis on communication and
partnerships with other development institutions, civil society, and the private sector.
II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

5.
Honduras is a lower middle income country with a per capita gross national income
of US$1,800 (2009 Atlas GNI per capita). It has about 7.5 million people and is the second
largest country in Central America, with an area of 112,492 square kilometers, and is the second
most populous. About half of the population of Honduras is rural, and 80 percent of the rural
population lives in hillside areas practicing subsistence agriculture. Increasing land degradation
and low agricultural productivity are major drivers of Honduras’ rural poverty. At 82.4
homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, in 2010 Honduras had the highest homicide rate in the world.
Political Context
6.
On June 28, 2009, the Honduran Supreme Court ordered the removal of President
Zelaya following his decision to conduct a referendum that, if won, would have allowed him
to convene a National Constituent Assembly to rewrite the Constitution and stand for reelection. An interim President was appointed by Congress the following day, to remain in place
until the November 2009 elections. Following these political developments, much of the
international community put aid programs on hold, although a number of donors continued
implementation of projects, particularly those focused on the poor. The Bank followed a process
consistent with Operational Policy (OP) 7.30, which included conducting an assessment of the
prevailing situation with respect to the de facto Government. During the assessment period the
Bank “paused” the implementation of the existing portfolio and no new lending was approved.
2

The situation remained fluid for much of 2009 and the Bank began to resume disbursements in
December 2009, once it was clear that the conditions of OP 7.30 were fulfilled.
7.
Porfirio Lobo from the National Party won the November 2009 elections with
55 percent of votes cast. International observers concluded that the elections were free and fair.
After President Lobo was inaugurated on January 27, 2010, the new Government quickly set
about a series of actions aimed at easing political tensions. Some of the most important steps
were naming a government of national reconciliation which included some political rivals;
establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission; working with Congress on important
Constitutional reforms; restoring diplomatic relations with partner countries; and prompt reengagement with the international community and development partners. The Government also
faced a major challenge bringing the fiscal situation under control (see below). In June 2011,
Honduras’ membership in the Organization of American States was restored, marking a
milestone in the country’s efforts to normalize international relations. Despite these advances,
however, there continue to be concerns of latent political instability and the widespread public
sentiment appears to be that change is not happening fast enough.
Governance Context
8.
The 2009 political crisis should be considered in the context of broader unresolved
governance issues in Honduras. As explored in the Institutional Governance Review, finalized
by the Bank during the first half of 2009: (i) the lack of transparency around decision-making;
(ii) the lack of available information to assess performance (which makes it difficult for citizens
to hold policymakers accountable); and (iii) the weak organizational capacity of groups
representing public interest, create conditions conducive to state capture and severely undermine
socio-economic and democratic development in the country.
9.
Honduras has put forth several efforts in recent years aimed at improving
governance conditions particularly focused on strengthening its institutional framework.
Progress, however, has been slow and uneven. Advances have been observed during recent years
in key reform areas, such as: the approval and implementation of the Law on Transparency and
Access to Information; the expansion and improvement of the use of a national e-procurement
system, as well as a public financial management (PFM) reform program based on SIAFI, to
address weaknesses in the areas of budget formulation, planning, management information
systems, internal controls, expenditure management, tax administration, external audits, and
procurement policies; and some progress in decentralization. Almost all of these areas, however,
were affected or set back as a result of the political crisis of 2009 and related events,
compounded by an environment of conflict, insecurity, deterioration of trust in public institutions
among Honduran society, and exacerbated social tensions.
10.
Honduras has advanced in the development of the Public Financial Management
systems by consolidating the SIAFI operation and further developing the UEPEX module
for project reporting. This has enhanced the fiduciary control environment by reducing the
amount of parallel systems, centralizing record management, and allowing a proper segregation
of duties and authorization levels through the system. The SIAFI system covers almost the
entirety of public administration budgeting, including SOEs and decentralized entities. The
system includes operations of Budget, Accounting and Treasury and has direct and automatic
3

links with Public Credit, Investments and Human Resources (SIARH) Systems. SEFIN is
planning to further develop this system by developing a SIAFI module for budget reporting at
the municipal level. Furthermore, payments flow from the Single Treasury Account directly to
beneficiaries’ bank accounts via wire transfers, ensuring that the beneficiary database is
permanently updated and granting traceability (audit trail) for government payments. Finally,
through the UEPEX Module, PIUs can report on the execution of externally-financed projects.
Currently, only the Bank and IDB are using this module, although it is expected that the donor
community will be adopting the system for their projects in the short term.
Recent Economic Developments
11.
The shocks that hit Honduras in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted the economy.
As the country struggled to cope with rising food and fuel prices, a tropical depression struck in
October 2008. Honduras was then hit particularly hard by the global financial crisis because its
economy is largely export driven, with high vulnerability to shifts in the global economy. Falling
tax revenues and growing expenditure pressures—amplified during the 2009 political crisis—
compromised the nation’s fiscal situation, with the combined public sector deficit increasing to
4.7 percent in 2009. As a result of these crises, the economy contracted 1.9 percent in 2009.
12.
The Honduran economy staged a moderate recovery in 2010, with exports and
public investment being the key drivers of growth. On the supply side, financial
intermediation was the most dynamic sector, growing 4.3 percent year over year, followed by
manufacturing at 4 percent. However, construction struggled for a second year, contracting 6.7
percent. On the demand side, public investment grew 19.7 percent year over year, followed by
exports at 6 percent. GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2010, a modest recovery after the decline in 2009.
13.
The recovery in 2010 was accompanied by a deterioration in the external balance
and an increase in inflation. The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent of GDP in
2009 to 6.2 percent in 2010. This reflects a jump in the merchandise trade deficit due to higher
oil prices. Inflation reached 6.5 percent in 2010, up from 3 percent in 2009. The surge in the
current account deficit was financed primarily by an increase in foreign direct investment and
long term public sector borrowing.
14.
Fiscal consolidation efforts started in 2010. The Combined Public Sector deficit was
2.9 percent of GDP in 2010, down from 4.7 percent in 2009 and well below the target of 3.7
percent under the IMF program. This improvement is mainly explained by a surplus from public
enterprises, tax reforms (which yielded 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP), and measures to control public
sector wages. In addition, the Central Government deficit reached 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010,
down from 6.2 percent in 2009. The Bank supported the country’s fiscal consolidation efforts
through a Development Policy Credit (US$76.4 million) delivered in November 2010, along
with the IMF program and similar budget support operations from the IDB, EU, and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration.
15.
The Government is committed to continuing its fiscal consolidation efforts. While the
fight on crime may need additional resources, the Government is taking the necessary measures
to secure them. In June 2011, Congress approved the Public Expenditure Efficiency Law, which
eliminates some tax exemptions and enforces new measures against tax evasion. In addition,
4

Congress approved the Security Tax Law in September 2011, which creates new taxes to finance
efforts to address security and social prevention programs. The new taxes are estimated to raise
government revenues by about 0.3 percent of GDP annually. Fiscal consolidation efforts also
include measures reducing the wage bill, increasing revenues through tax administration
efficiency, and addressing the contingent liabilities in pensions.

16.
The rapid rise in the public sector wage bill has been halted. Rising public wages
have been a significant fiscal challenge in Honduras over the past decade. The proliferation of
special pay regimes for civil servants, notably teachers and health workers, has led to the wage
bill representing about 75 percent of total tax revenues and more than three times the size of the
investment budget. To counter the trend, the Government introduced several measures last year
5

to freeze the wage bill at 11 percent of GDP, recently initiating additional reforms expected to
now lead to a decline of the wage bill to about 10 percent of GDP by the end of 2011.
17.
The public pension systems have important actuarial deficits, but the Government is
taking steps to reduce them. The Instituto Nacional de Previsión del Magisterio (INPREMA),
which serves both private sector and public sector teachers, has an actuarial deficit of about
US$4 billion and reserves have started to deplete. The Government has presented a Law to
Congress that puts the management of INPREMA in the hands of technical and actuarial
professionals to improve the management of assets as well as making several parametric
adjustments in the pension law to gradual changes in the retirement age and the minimum
number of working years. Similarly, the Instituto Nacional de Jubilación y Pensiones de los
Empleados Públicos (INJUPEMP), which covers Central Government civil servants, has an
actuarial deficit of about US$1.7 billion. The Government has submitted a bill to the Congress to
reform INJUPEMP as well.
18.
After weathering the crisis quite well, the domestic financial system is gradually
improving. Since the beginning of 2011, the Central Bank has reduced reserve requirements. As
a result, overall funding costs have decreased and stimulated credit demand, while a growth in
the banking system’s deposit base has helped maintain liquidity at adequate levels. The banking
system reported a non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of 4.5 percent in June 2011, which is lower
than the pre-crisis level (6.5 percent in June 2009), but still above the regional average. The
coverage ratio of provisions/NPL increased from 59 percent in 2009 to 84 percent in 2011. All
banks complied with the minimum capital requirements of 10 percent of risk weighted assets.
Supervision of the banking sector has also improved in the last year, due to the implementation
of an ambitious plan to strengthen the Banking and Insurance Commission's (CNBS) supervisory
capacity with the help of the Bank’s Financial Sector Technical Assistance Credit and the IDB.
Crime and Violence, Citizen Security
19.
Weak governance, political instability, low growth, and persistent poverty have
contributed to a fertile ground for crime and violence. Between 2005 and 2010, the country’s
homicide rate doubled from 37 to 82.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, moving it from third to
first place in Central America (see Figure 1 on next page), and indeed the world. Violence is
concentrated in urban areas. Among cities with more than 100,000 people, the most violent are
La Ceiba (158 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants), San Pedro Sula (148), Juticalpa (129), Puerto
Cortes (109), Comayagua (104), and Tegucigalpa and Comayaguela (93). Most victims of
homicides are males (94 percent), particularly those between 15 and 34 years of age (30 percent).
20.
In the past five years, violence against women has increased by 125 percent, and
women’s homicide rates have increased from 4.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005
to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010. In addition, according to the 2005 National
Demographic and Health Survey (ENESF), 15 percent of women were victims of some form of
violence at least once in the previous 12 months. The level of education correlates with the
probability of maltreatment; for instance, 20 percent of women with no education experienced
violence at least once in their lifetime, while the share was significantly lower for women with
tertiary education levels (12 percent).

21.
The economic costs of crime and violence in Honduras are very high. A recent Bank
study estimates that the economic costs of this violence are about 10 percent of Honduras’ GDP
(nearly US$900 million) per year. The report also finds that reducing homicide rates by 10
percent could boost annual economic growth in Honduras by 0.7 percent.
22.
The escalating levels of crime and violence in Honduras are partly the result of
external phenomena such as drug trafficking. The shift in drug trafficking routes between
South America and North America from the Caribbean to the Central America-Mexico corridor
has made drug trafficking the main single factor behind the rising violence level in Honduras in
recent years. There is a correlation between homicide rates and the country’s areas with high
intensity of drug trafficking, such as the Atlantic coast and the bordering areas with Guatemala.
23.
Similar to other countries of Central America’s Northern Triangle, the deportation
of transnational youth gang members from US prisons since the mid-1990s has contributed
to the proliferation of youth gangs in Honduras. It is estimated that about 112 youth gangs or
maras (36,000 members) are now operating in the country, and that 15 percent of homicides are
gang-related. While the role of youth gangs has tended to be exaggerated, its close links with
different forms of organized crime has made them a growing threat for citizen security.
24.
The impact of these external stresses has been amplified by the high prevalence of
many of the risk factors that make individuals and communities vulnerable to violence.
Studies show that violence does not result from a single risk factor but from the accumulation of
multiple disadvantages and risk factors. Violent individuals tend to experience disadvantages not
only at the individual level (e.g., low education, poor employability skills) but also in their
families (domestic violence, lack of parental monitoring), relationships (friends who are gang
members, violence against women), communities (living in violence hotspots with high presence
of guns, drugs, alcohol), and society at large (stigmatization of poor youth as criminals,
repressive and corrupt police). Territorial “hotspots” of crime and violence tend to coincide with
enclaves of urban inequality suffering from multiple disadvantages (e.g. high levels of poverty,
low social capital, lack of basic services, high exposure to natural disasters, urban decay).
25.
Honduras shows a high prevalence of many of these risk factors. For instance, for at
least the last two decades, Honduras has had high levels of outmigration in search of labor,
7

leaving dysfunctional family structures where young children and youth often do not have
sufficient parental supervision, rendering these children prey to the guidance and structure
offered by the maras. Another risk factor, for example, is that it has high levels of firearms with
weak enforcement of the regulatory framework. In 2010, around 151,000 firearms were
registered but the actual estimated number of total firearms was close to 800,000.
26.
The criminal justice system has been ineffective in its preventive, deterrence, or
punitive roles, weakened by the corrupting influence of organized crime, and thus
undermining good governance and the rule of law. As the ill-equipped justice and security
organs of the state struggle and often fail to combat organized crime, Honduran citizens’ trust in
the rule of law declines. Overall trust in criminal justice institutions and the police have declined
from 51 percent in 2004 to 41 percent in 2008, and from 57 percent in 2004 to 44 percent in
2008, respectively.
27.
To sum up, crime and violence is undermining Honduras’ growth potential and
investment climate, social progress, and efforts at good governance. Given the multiple
factors contributing to such high levels of crime and violence, any attempt to address this
through isolated interventions is not likely to succeed. Hence, there is need for a multi-faceted
approach which takes account of the individual, family, community, and policy dimensions.
Poverty, Inequality, Gender and Social Development
28.
Honduras remains one of the poorest and most unequal countries in Latin America.
Consumption-based poverty figures for 2009 indicate that about 44.5 percent of the population
were living in poverty and 20.1 percent in extreme poverty (Figure 2). Also, according to official
figures, the Gini coefficient measuring income inequality for 2007 stood at 0.57. These figures
are among the highest in Latin America. Income based poverty measures are even higher; INE
surveys indicate that for 2010 the population under the poverty line was at 66.2 percent, and
extreme poverty 45.3 percent (http://www.ine.gob.hn/drupal/node/123). Furthermore, according
to the Honduras Poverty Assessment (2006), indigenous peoples and other non-Mestizo/Ladino
groups account for 6.5 percent of the population, with 71 percent living below the poverty line.
29.
The poverty prevalence in Honduras was declining steadily in the early 2000s, but
this trend was halted and reversed due to the combined crises of 2009. Poverty in Honduras
may have risen by more than 150,000 people between 2009 and 2010 as a result of the economic
contraction in 2009, before starting to fall again slowly as growth recovers. The decline in
remittances constitutes an important transmission mechanism. Around a quarter of the poorest
20 percent of the population receive remittances, and this contributes around a quarter of their
total incomes. The recent crisis destroyed circa 35,000 jobs, of which 15,000 jobs were in the
labor-intensive export-oriented sector (or maquilas). The effects were felt more in urban areas,
where unemployment rose from 3.9 percent in 2008 to 6.4 percent in 2010. Rural areas were less
affected and even managed to sustain employment in the agriculture sector, but of a low-paying
and highly informal nature, acting as an “employment of last resort”.

30.
Despite an impressive 47 percent reduction between 1990 and 2008, the maternal
mortality ratio (MMR) in Honduras is still high for the Region (110 per 100,000 live
births). Thus, Honduras is one of the four LAC focus countries in the WB Reproductive Health
Action Plan (RHAP) that targets countries with high maternal mortality and high fertility. Most
of the reduction happened between 1990 and 1997 and is attributed to a combination of increased
skilled attendance and improved referrals of obstetric emergencies and high-risk women.
31.
Early childbearing in Honduras remains high, especially among the poor.
Adolescent fertility rates reached 93 per 1,000 women (WDI 2009). Data from the last available
Demographic and Health Survey show that 40 percent of women aged 20-49 who have had a
child did so before reaching 20 years age, and 23 percent before reaching 18 years. In rural areas,
these percentages increase to 47 percent and 28 percent respectively. Adolescent girls in the
poorest income quintile are three times more likely to become mothers than their richest
counterparts (31 percent and 10 percent, respectively). Education seems to have a huge impact
on whether or not adolescent girls become mothers or not: 46 percent of girls who are pregnant
or mothers (age 15-19) have no education; 42 percent completed primary school; 11 percent
finished secondary school, and only 2 percent attend tertiary education.
32.
Over the past two decades Honduras has devoted an increasing share of public
spending to the education sector, yet learning outcomes remain weak. Education spending
rose from an already high 5 percent of GDP to 8.6 percent of GDP between 1990 and 2007.
These increases facilitated an expansion in coverage, as a result of which in 2009, 83 percent of
15-19 year olds had completed at least 6 years of education compared to 78 percent for a cohort
5 years older. However, Honduras has not been able to increase student learning outcomes, due
in part to serious teacher absenteeism and a resistance to implement reforms by strong teachers’
unions. Bank analysis also shows high drop-out among 12 to 15 year olds and this has not
changed between 2000 and 2009. There is also a related problem of high repetition in grades 13, which contributes to low grade attainment and high drop-out. This situation also has serious
implications in terms of violence, given that dropping out of school is one of the primary risk
factors for the involvement of children and youth in crime and violence.

33.
Gender gaps persist. Over the last decades the government of Honduras has taken
decisive steps to strengthen the legal and institutional framework to promote women’s rights and
gender equality. However, laws do not automatically translate into reality and, thus, gender gaps
remain and persist (see Figure 3 and Annex 4 for a detailed analysis of gender issues).

Female labor force participation in Honduras is one of the lowest in Latin America.
In 2009 (WDI), it was 40.1 percent compared to 80.2 percent for male labor force participation.
However, women’s participation in the labor market is almost twice as high in urban areas. The
Central America Regional Gender Study (2011) shows that the gender wage gap in Honduras is
about 5.6 percent, and is 16.3 percent if controlling for age and education, placing it within the
group of LAC countries with the highest gender wage gaps. This inequality can be explained by
cultural or social factors such as differential preferences between men and women, formal and
informal systems of education that collectively result in the reinforcement of gender stereotypes,
and societal expectations that limit women’s access to the labor market.
35.
Gender and age-related issues have led to risky behaviors that may contribute to
violence as a major development challenge for Honduras. High teenage pregnancy rates,
especially among poor women leads not only to a large proportion of households headed by
women—at 35 percent in 2006 it is the highest for Central America—but also to higher drop-out
rates in this group, which makes it harder for young women to obtain quality employment.
Among boys, dropping out of school, compounded by the lack of employment opportunities,
may lead to their involvement in gangs as well as in crime and drug trafficking.
36.
These are complex dynamics that call for multi-sector approaches to deal with
gender and youth issues. For example, teenage pregnancy need not be part of a traditional
health project. Rather, it might be better addressed through social protection interventions, and
could also be connected with issues of youth at risk and youth unemployment.
10

Environmental Vulnerability
37.
Honduras ranks 9th among countries at relatively high mortality risk from
exposure to two or more natural/environmental hazards. In fact, the country is exposed to
hazards from various sources that include extensive deforestation and land degradation, tropical
storms, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Over the last 30 years, the 50 natural disaster events
that hit Honduras have killed 15,500 and affected 3.6 million people with losses valued at around
US$4.7 billion. In fact, as this CPS is being submitted, Honduras and its neighbors are assessing
the losses from the heavy rains and floods which engulfed Central America in mid-October 2011
(Tropical Depression 12-E). Climate change models have predicted that Honduras is expected to
endure increased-intensity rainfalls, more frequent heat waves and droughts, and rising sea
levels, as predicted for the rest of Mesoamerica.
38.
The 1998 Hurricane Mitch, considered the worst disaster experienced by the
country in recent times, highlighted to the Government and its development partners the
urgent need to move from a reactive to a pro-active, ex-ante approach to disaster risk
management (DRM). With support from the Bank’s Disaster Risk Mitigation Project, which
closed in 2010, and a series of grants, national capacity for DRM has been improved, including
the preparation and passage of the 2009 law establishing a formal disaster risk management
system (SINAGER) and strengthening of key agencies such as the Disaster Preparedness and
Response Agency (COPECO) and the Ministry of Environment (SERNA). These institutions
effectively coordinated the response to the heavy rains of 2011. Additionally, the consolidation
of flood early warning systems covering four main watersheds have also improved national
capacity to prevent loss of life. In order for these efforts to have a sustained impact, COPECO
will need to continue improving its internal capacity as well as leadership role among the
multiple stakeholders involved in DRM activities in Honduras.
Box 1. Better DRM with the Aid of the Honduras Disaster Risk Mitigation Project (closed 2010)
The legal and institutional framework for DRM was improved through support to the preparation
and passage of the 2009 SINAGER Law that established a formal DRM system for Honduras;
strengthening of key agencies such as the Disaster Preparedness and Response Agency (COPECO) and
the Ministry of Environment (SERNA); and implementation of a disaster awareness campaign.
National capacity for hydro-meteorological and geophysical monitoring, and for flood
forecasting was improved through consolidation of the original old and small-scale flood early
warning system covering four of the main watersheds in the country, which were destroyed during
Hurricane Mitch; adoption of early warning systems for landslides (8 municipalities); adoption of a
monitoring system for droughts (18 municipalities); establishment of community-based early warning
systems (7 municipalities); and production of close to 3,500 layers of geo-spatial information.
Local vulnerability was reduced through the establishment of 95 municipal disaster emergency
committees and 375 local emergency committees that actively engaged a total of 6,000 people;
completion of participatory DRM programs in 81 municipalities; preparation of engineering designs
for priority structural and non structural mitigation measures in 61 municipalities; completion of
structural mitigation measures in 58 municipalities which benefited over 500,000 people, including
close to 130,000 directly protected (according to the 2001 Census); and completion of drought
mitigation measures in 8 municipalities.

11

Medium-term Economic Perspectives
39.
The Honduran economy is expected to grow 3.4 percent in 2011, an improvement
from 2009-2010 but a low rate compared with those posted in the mid-2000s. On the one
hand, as the economies of Honduras’ major trade partners are slowing down, labor-intensive
exports have stagnated. On the other hand, as commodity prices remain high, the value of
agriculture exports such as coffee and bananas have increased. In addition, the economic
slowdown in the US is expected to result in stagnation in remittances relative to 2010. Total
exports are expected to grow 22.5 percent while imports are projected to increase 18.2 percent.
Foreign direct investment is expected to rise from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 5.5 percent of
GDP in 2011.
40.
In view of the global economic uncertainty, the authorities have cautiously focused
on fiscal structural reforms and a gradual tightening of fiscal policy to act promptly in case
an adverse scenario materializes. The Central Bank is also conscious of the need of continuing
to enhance its capacity to deploy counter-cyclical policy, if needed. In this regard, the greater
exchange rate flexibility introduced recently (see below) is part of the strategy to buffer the
likely impact of a more pronounced slow down. Under a double dip recession scenario in the
world economy, Honduras’ GDP can be expected to contract in 2012 similarly as it did in 2008
(about 2 percent) as exports and remittance flows slow down. However, on the back of the recent
structural reforms undertaken on the fiscal side, the central government deficit is not expected to
increase as much as in 2008 (6.2 percent of GDP), reaching about 4.5 percent of GDP. In
addition, although in this scenario exchange rate depreciation would increase the value of foreign
debt, Honduras has a relatively low debt to GDP ratio (27.8 percent of GDP) that could provide a
cushion and would allow the country to access additional financing from multilaterals and
domestic creditors if needed to sustain expenditure levels.
41.
Monetary policy has remained vigilant as headline inflation has picked up. Headline
inflation stood at 6.5 percent in July, and current projections suggest it will reach 8.2 percent by
end-2011, which is inside the Central Bank’s target range of 7-9 percent. The Central Bank is
committed to meeting its inflation target. To attain this goal, it will continue to mop up excess
liquidity through the placement of its own securities. In the near term, the exchange rate will
continue to serve as the main anchor for inflation expectations. In the medium term, commodity
and fuel prices are expected to decline and thus inflation is projected to follow a similar trend
and reach 6 percent in 2014.
42.
The Government introduced a crawling exchange-rate in late July 2011, ensuring
greater exchange rate flexibility. The crawl rate will be equal to the expected differential
between domestic and foreign inflation and changes in the nominal effective exchange rate. Over
time the exchange rate will be allowed to move freely within the crawling band.
43.
A debt sustainability analysis suggests that Honduras’ public debt is on a
sustainable trajectory. In the baseline scenario, the public-debt-to-GDP is expected to increase
from 26.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 28 percent in 2012 and gradually decline afterwards. The
trajectory of public debt is projected to decline even under the most pessimistic alternative
scenarios considered in the analysis.

III.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

Long-Term Country Vision and Nation’s Plan
44.
The Porfirio Lobo Administration´s development agenda fits into the Country
Vision 2010-2038 (Visión de País 2010-2038) and National Plan 2010-2022 (Plan de Nación
2010-2022). Different from previous Executive Branch-driven Poverty Reduction Strategies
(PRS), the Honduran Congress launched in early 2009 an initiative to develop a Country Vision
with a long term planning horizon, based on the previous 2003 and 2008 PRS documents. The
draft Vision and Plan received wide acceptance from the presidential candidates before the
November 27, 2009 elections, leading to Congress approving the proposed long term
development plans in January 2010, elevating the initiative as Country Law. While the Country
Vision 2010-2038 provides principles, national objectives, and targets for the referred period, the
National Plan 2010-2022 provides strategic guidelines, objectives and indicators derived from
the Vision applicable to the 2010-13, 2014-18, and 2019-22 presidential terms. Feedback from
civil society point to a need for greater Government effort at dialogue with civil society
organizations during the remaining period of the implementation.
The Lobo Administration’s Priorities
45.
In accordance with the Country Vision and Nation Plan, the Lobo Administration
has set up a set of targets defined as metas imperdonables or “targets which cannot be
forgiven”. Defined as commitments that the Lobo Administration has promised to deliver
before the end of its term, the Secretary of the Presidency has compiled a set of 115 targets.
These targets reflect social, citizen’s security, good governance and economic priorities, 19 of
them highlighted as political priorities. Targets can be organized into four groups.
46.
Improving social investments and opportunities. The Government has declared its
commitment to designing and implementing national policies oriented towards reducing the
vulnerability of youth at risk, promoting child nutrition, schooling and learning outcomes, and
increased health coverage, decentralizing services in 60 main cities covering about two-thirds of
the population while still providing direct services to the remaining population. Government has
made efforts, particularly in the education sector, to increase the number of schooling days,
increasing the quality and diversification of education, and increasing the state budget for this
sector. There is, however, political interference from Congress and powerful interest groups such
as teachers’ unions, hampering Government in its efforts to move forward.
47.
Crime and violence prevention. The second group of priorities is aimed at
strengthening crime and violence prevention. In September 2011 the Government of Honduras
approved a National Citizen Security and Coexistence Policy for 2011-2022. This is the first
time the Government has formulated a policy that combines the traditional emphasis on crime
control with a stronger emphasis on the prevention of crime and violence. The strategy’s three
pillars include: (i) strengthening national and local management of citizen security policy, (ii)
implementing programs on crime and violence prevention and social cohesion with a human
rights approach, and (iii) strengthening the infrastructure for security, alternative justice, and the
penitentiary system. The policy aims to address the main risk factors (guns, drugs, gangs, lack of
family and community cohesion) and protective factors (a culture of prevention, availability of
13

conflict resolution mechanisms, and greater opportunities for youth) that influence crime and
violence. Criminal law enforcement is a key element of the national strategy, and it will be
further developed through a specific policy aimed at strengthening coordination between justice
and security sectors. The Policy will also support the strengthening of national and local
institutions to address gender-based violence issues more effectively.
48.
Social protection and reaching those in extreme poverty. The third group of priorities
is aimed at strengthening the social protection network focusing on the most vulnerable,
providing access to conditional cash transfers to 600,000 families on an annual basis, access to
health and education, reduce child mortality, incrementing access to housing and to basic
medication, increasing access of public servants to the public pension system, establishing a
sustainable mechanism to adjust minimum wages.
49.
Improving economic growth and good governance. The fourth group of priorities has a
dual focus. In terms of facilitating economic growth, the Government envisages the development
of public private partnerships, strengthening the business climate, reducing government’s red
tape, and agribusiness development. It aims to provide better access to water for irrigation,
facilitating access to credit and technical assistance to the rural poor, and to small and mid size
entrepreneurs, particularly to women working in agriculture. Government has prioritized the
expansion of the Port of Puerto Cortés in the North, the Central Corridor Highway, and the
Atlantic Coast Highway system, as well as the expansion of telecommunications and
modernization of the energy sector. In addition, providing rural infrastructure and technical
assistance in agriculture is expected to increase opportunities for economic growth in rural areas
50.
The Government is also committed to completing the governance reforms that were
initiated during the previous administration but whose implementation was delayed due to the
political crisis. This includes reducing tax evasion, increasing tax collection, improving public
investment, and efficiency and transparency in public spending. Also in this group are:
implementing mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating public sector performance,
transparency in the acquisition of goods, works and services, and access to information for civil
society participation. The Government is developing an updated Anticorruption Plan (focused on
the Executive Branch of Government) to follow up on the first one drafted in 2007, which will
include the design and implementation of a National Policy and System of Integrity.

LESSONS FROM PAST WORLD BANK EXPERIENCE

Recent Bank Implementation Experience
51.
The FY07-FY10 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Honduras was aligned with
the broad framework of the poverty reduction strategy prepared during the Maduro
administration and priorities identified by the administration of President Manuel Zelaya.
The CAS identified four strategic pillars: (i) Equitable Economic Growth for Employment
Generation; (ii) Good Governance through State Modernization and Civic Participation; (iii)
Environmental Protection and Risk Management; and (iv) Development of Human Capital. A
CAS Progress Report (CPR), May 2008, delivered a positive message on progress towards
achieving results, but amended the program by ending a series of Poverty Reduction Support
Credits citing the challenges of delivering this in the buildup to a presidential election. It warned
14

of rising food and oil prices and also the potential impact of the forthcoming economic downturn
in the US, but its early preparation meant that it did not foresee the political situation that came
to be a dominant issue impacting the latter part of the CAS period.
52.
The WBG responded to the Honduran political and fiscal crisis of 2009 with an
Interim Strategy Note (ISN), approved by the Board along with a US$75 million
Development Policy Credit on September 29, 2010. The ISN was aligned with President
Lobo’s National Plan 2010-2022, and enabled the Bank to convert the remaining IDA 15
allocation into an important fiscal tool to help the administration gain fiscal control, as well as
support reforms in public financial management and energy.
53.
As of October 31, 2011 the Bank’s IDA-financed lending portfolio in Honduras
consisted of 12 operations and an undisbursed amount of US$253 million1 (see Table 2). In
addition to IDA resources, the Bank has also mobilized donor-financed Trust Funds for a range
of activities in Honduras, with an undisbursed balance of US$10 million as of this date.

At the same time, the IFC has been scaling up its involvement in Honduras, with
investments rising from US$38 million in FY08, to a committed balance of US$250 million at
the end of June 2011. The bulk of IFC activity over the past two years has been in the financial
sector, telecoms, and agribusiness. Loans accounted for US$135 million of FY11 commitments,
whereas trade finance and risk guarantees accounted for US$82 and equity US$34 million
respectively. (See Annex 3 for further details on IFC’s engagement in Honduras.)
55.
Following the removal from office of President Zelaya, the Bank “paused” its
operations while it carried out an assessment in line with OP7.30. Before resuming
disbursements the Bank carried out individual project supervision in line with its fiduciary
responsibilities. Despite normal operational engagement being achieved by February 2010, the
political transition affected project implementation. Several projects have required some time to
1

This includes one GEF operation for Honduras and does not include a Regional GEF operation (Corazon
Transboundary Reserve) for Honduras and Nicaragua jointly.
15

review and develop their procurement plans and are poised to accelerate disbursements in FY12.
At the request of the Government, the Bank has also restructured a part of the existing IDA
portfolio to release approximately US$15 million in IDA resources from activities that are no
longer a priority or achievable by their closing date, with the intention of directing them towards
activities that it considers higher priority.
56.
While the “pause” provided the country team with an opportunity to address some
implementation challenges, disbursement ratios have not yet recovered to pre-pause levels.
The disbursement ratio of the portfolio fell dramatically from 36.7 percent at the end of FY 2006
to just 16.1 percent in FY2009 (just before the pause in operations), followed by 12 percent in
FY10 and 15.1 percent in FY11.
Key Lessons
57.
The following implementation experiences and challenges are based on the findings
described in the CAS Completion Report (see Annex 1) and provide key lessons for this CPS.
On Strategy


The impact of the CPS will be circumscribed by both the limited implementation capacity
across the Government and the limited resources of the Bank, financially (IDA/IBRD) as
well as administratively. In order to make a meaningful contribution to the broader
development outcomes of the country, the Bank’s CPS should define areas of engagement
selectively. Selectivity can best be exercised by focusing on those sectors where Government
has demonstrated strong demand and commitments, which are of major development
importance, and where the Bank is prepared to deliver. Similarly, analytical work through
TA or policy dialogue also needs to be focused and sustained over time to have impact. This
argues for a programmatic approach, instead of moving from one discrete area to another.



A focus on selectivity also points to the need to rationalize the existing lending portfolio to
improve potential for impact. To this end, part of the portfolio was restructured in
September-October 2011 to release approximately US$15 million in IDA resources for reallocation to other, higher priority activities in the Honduras program.



The CPS will also explore options for building synergies across a cluster of
interventions. One way of creating synergies, for example, would be to target communities
that are vulnerable to multiple risks (such as high rates of crime and violence, natural
disasters, and road safety, in addition to high rates of poverty and inequality), by utilizing the
concept of ‘urban risk reduction.’ Integrated information systems (that include data on these
risks, ideally GIS mapped) can be a tool developed to enhance planning efforts. Another area
for synergies lies in improving the delivery of social payments through the financial system.
The Bank is providing technical assistance to these efforts, which aim to reduce the costs of
delivery while providing incentives for the expansion of the formal financial system and
greater financial inclusion of the population in hitherto underserved areas.



Greater selectivity in lending and analytical engagement will also mean that the Bank may
gradually withdraw from areas where it has been involved or change its modality of
16

engagement (e.g. from direct investment lending in the education sector to programmatic
non-lending AAA and policy dialogue). It also implies that the new CPS should place
greater emphasis on partnerships with other institutions to assure their presence in those
areas where the Bank is scaling back.
On Implementation


Capacity challenges in the civil service are a binding constraint to portfolio
performance. Projects across all sectors struggled with implementation capacity constraints
in planning, procurement, and financial management, further compounded by the endemic
phenomenon of civil service and project management turnover which accompanies each new
administration. For this reason, institutional strengthening has to be part of every operation
and kept appropriately simple. Regular CPPRs are essential to keep the government engaged
in this process, supplemented by regular training for counterparts in procurement, financial
management, and monitoring and evaluation. Clear and simplified results frameworks can
help implementation of even multi-sector engagements.



Working directly with municipalities can help bypass some of the difficulties
encountered at the central level. Some success stories show that working with municipal
governments can improve implementation because of stronger citizen accountability even if
their capacity is weaker. The Bank Group can further explore this form of engagement. The
2009 IGR lays out specific recommendations for building confidence in municipal
institutions, developing municipal institutional capacity, and incentivizing good municipal
reporting and transparency. In the area of crime and violence prevention, for example,
working at the local/municipal level has proven to be one of the most effective approaches
for addressing crime and violence.



Use AAA strategically to respond to government demands towards the implementation
of its strategic goals. During the last CAS a good part of the AAA was not delivered, or if
delivered was poorly disseminated. While the extraordinary circumstances explain the weak
AAA delivery, the Bank should more clearly agree with Government the priority areas of
focus for the knowledge products and services in the CPS.

Stakeholder Consultations
58.
A number of stakeholder consultations have been undertaken around the proposed
CPS. In all, close to 250 people from different groups, including government, civil society
organizations, private sector, and donor agencies, participated in the consultation process.
Overall, the participants of the consultations agreed with the proposed focus of this CPS, which
is laid out in Section V below. The feedback from the civil society consultations was particularly
rich, both on past performance as well as suggestions on how the Bank’s engagement can be
strengthened going forward. The topics that were raised most frequently in these discussions was
that the Bank should continue its engagement in the promotion of governance and transparency
in Government policies and performance, as well as a strong desire that the Bank should also
make its own studies and analytical work more open and accessible to the public in Honduras. A
detailed account of the consultations for the CPS can be found in Annex 5.

V.

WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR HONDURAS

Country Partnership Strategy Overview
59.
The World Bank Group Program. This CPS proposes an IDA lending program in the
order of SDR 109.5 million or at current exchange rates approximately US$171 million over
FY12-14 (which coincides with the IDA 16 cycle). In addition, IFC will continue to pursue its
active strategy of support for private sector-led growth. IDA resources are proposed to be frontloaded under the CPS to enable a strong start to implementation well before the build-up to the
next elections. Close coordination between IDA and IFC will be maintained.
60.
IBRD creditworthiness. Should Honduras achieve a blend IDA-IBRD status in the
course of this CPS period, IDA and IBRD resources would be utilized in complementary ways.
A CPS Progress Report and modified strategy would be discussed with the country authorities
and the Bank’s Board.
61.
Strategic orientation and selectivity will be major principles of the CPS. Given the
limited IDA resources available to help address Honduras’ ambitious development agenda, the
persistent implementation constraints, and lessons learned, this CPS will contribute to the
national development agenda strategically and selectively. It will reorient the existing program
toward key Strategic Objectives supporting the major development priorities of Honduras, and
will focus new engagement to reinforce these objectives. Selectivity will mean fewer, larger
operations supported by programmatic approaches and partnerships that leverage additional
resources from other sources. Selectivity also means that the CPS does not envisage at this time
new investment financing in some areas where the Bank has traditionally been providing
financing, such as roads, education, or health. Greater attention will be paid to design
simplification to improve project disbursement ratios and development effectiveness.
62.
CPS results need to be defined with realism. The WBG is aware of the high risks and
the limited scope of the proposed engagement as compared to the size of the financial needs of
the country. It will be important to manage expectations both within Honduras and within the
Bank team as to what is achievable and attributable to Bank support under the CPS. Thus, while
striving to maximize the development impact of its program of support, the CPS will also define
its expected results in modest, pragmatic, and realistic terms.
Strategic Objectives, Results Areas, and Instruments
63.
Over the CPS period the WBG will contribute to achieving Honduras’ national
development goals by supporting three strategic objectives and selected results within these
three areas (see Figure 4). Strategic Objectives 2—Expanding Opportunities through Reducing
Vulnerabilities and 3—Enhancing Good Governance represent elements of continuity from the
preceding CAS, given the contextual analysis and consultations feedback on the importance of
sustained engagement in these areas. In sharp contrast, Strategic Objective 1—Improving Citizen
Security is a new focus area for the Bank program in Honduras. All activities to be supported by
the Bank under the CPS will be in accordance with the institution's development mandate as
defined by its Articles and the applicable legal and policy framework.

Strategic Objective One—Improving Citizen Security
64.
Overview. Given the importance of this agenda for the future development of Honduras,
the improvement of citizen security will be the first strategic objective of the CPS. By including
for the first time a pillar on citizen security, this CPS is following one of the key
recommendations of the World Development Report (WDR) 2011 on Conflict, Security and
Development, which promotes the inclusion of citizen security into country partnership strategies
as a way of helping countries promote peace and state-building. The impact of the CPS can only
be modest, however, given that this agenda is dauntingly difficult and the experience of the Bank
is also relatively new. Nevertheless, the Bank cannot retreat from taking action. Hence this CPS
puts forward a program of complementary and parallel interventions to help Honduras contend
with this extremely important challenge.
65.
Result 1.1 Strengthened national capacity to address citizen security. The Bank’s
proposed strategy involves assisting the Government with building its capacity to implement a
multi-sectoral and integrated citizen security strategy at both the national and local levels in
order to address some of the key underlying factors which contribute to heightened insecurity.


Via an improved policy environment. The CPS aims to support the implementation of the
National Citizen Security and Coexistence Policy with a focus on social prevention programs
and strengthening the related governance structures. The Bank will also help build the antimoney laundering capacity of institutions and a base for better data on crime and violence.
Accordingly, the programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities to Growth DPC series, which has
citizen security as a pillar, will support the coordination function of the Citizen Security
National Council; ensure that grievance mechanisms and other forms of civil society
oversight are put in place to promote accountability in policy implementation; assist
developing transparent, effective budget allocations as well as an action plan for social
prevention activities; and carry out a public expenditure and institutional review of the
security sector as part of the PER. The Bank’s assistance to improve implementation of
Honduras’ anti-money laundering regime will continue. This includes assistance for a
national risk assessment on proceeds of crime to detect the critical vulnerabilities, address
the related regulatory, institutional and other deficiencies, and specification of an action plan.
19

Capacity-building assistance is envisaged for financial sector supervisors as the first line of
defense against the recycling of criminal money in the economy. The Prosecutor’s Office
(Fiscalia) could also benefit from capacity building to better use all “follow the money”
tools, particularly towards transnational crime. Moreover, the Bank has mobilized a Grant to
strengthen data/crime and violence information systems, i.e. the National Violence
Observatory, to develop a basis for monitoring and evaluation and informed policy making.


Via improved violence prevention capacity of local governments and communities.
Throughout Honduras neglected poor urban neighborhoods have higher levels of crime and
violence, further marginalized by weak infrastructure connections and lacking community
organization. The Bank will help to develop and finance interventions to reduce the physical,
social, and economic exclusion of communities and municipalities where violence is high,
with the ultimate goal of making them more resilient to all of the consequences related to the
heightened levels of crime and violence. This includes collaborating with other donors in the
implementation of the flagship Safer Municipalities Program/Municipios Mas Seguros,
aimed at developing local strategies for violence prevention and inter-sectoral interventions
“hot spots,” and building the capacities of local governments to lead municipal citizen
security plans, using the WBI’s Municipal Capacity Building Course on Urban Crime and
Violence Prevention.



The CPS will also contribute to strengthening the role of schools as strategic institutions for
community-based violence prevention. The Bank’s School-Based Violence Prevention
Toolkit includes a series of steps that schools and communities can take to design violence
prevention programs and to create ‘safe schools’ both in terms of violence and disaster risk.



In addition, efforts to capture and share emerging lessons learned from operations that are
currently under implementation and which include important crime and violence prevention
interventions, such as the Barrio Ciudad Project (Box 2) and its companion JSDF Grant on
Employment Generation in Poor Urban Areas, will continue. The multi-dimensional
approach of Barrio Ciudad has shown great promise for impact and is a potential area for
scaling up. Accordingly, this CPS envisages a new multi-sector Urban Vulnerability
Reduction Project (FY13) which integrates physical, economic, and social interventions,
including employment generation for youth-at-risk, to prepare for and address multiple
sources of vulnerability in violent hot-spot localities.
Box 2. Barrio Ciudad—Community-Based Prevention Activities Demonstrate Positive Results
Experiences from the Barrio Ciudad Project, currently under implementation, are especially
noteworthy. The design of Barrio Ciudad involved identifying neighborhoods that were hotspots and
focusing physical, social and economic interventions on the individuals, families and communities
living in these neighborhoods in order to enhance crime prevention. This design was based on world
experience on crime and violence prevention and the importance of multi-sectoral coordinated
interventions in areas that have high-levels of crime and violence.
As part of the new CPS, the Bank will work with the Government to consider extending these
approaches that address violence prevention through the combination of basic services provision
together with social prevention interventions, including the possibility of implementing this type of
operation in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.
20



The Bank will mobilize its expertise on social accountability and transparency to encourage
good governance of citizen security at national and local levels. Community participation in
policing activities and public outreach has also proven successful in local contexts, as
evidenced in Barrio Ciudad for example, since it has created bonds of trust, increased crime
reporting, and reduced police abuse. These initiatives also build upon decentralized
municipal approaches, a key new theme of engagement in the CPS.



Finally, the Bank will make a concerted effort to both mainstream crime and violence
prevention measures across its portfolio and promote synergies between projects,
particularly if they are being implemented in the same municipalities/communities.



Via employment opportunities for youth-at-risk. Youth unemployment and
underemployment is associated with a higher probability of youth engaging in risky
behavior, including crime and violence, given limited opportunities elsewhere. Honduras has
substantial experience in development active labor market policies, but coverage is low and
not well-targeted to priority groups such as youngsters. The Bank will focus on developing
approaches for raising the skills of young people for improving employability and transition
to the labor market. It will support initiatives that engage the private sector in the
development of multi-dimensional approaches to violence and crime, including employment
generation for youth at risk, job-skills training, among others. This will include
implementation of the Mi Primer Empleo component of the Nutrition and Social Protection
Project, which received Additional Financing in June 2011, as well as the JSDF for
Employment Generation in Poor Urban Neighborhoods accompanying the Barrio Ciudad
Project. The IFC may also finance technical training facilities provided through the private
sector. The Bank will also establish strategic partnerships with Government, business
chambers and federations, to disseminate its recently-developed Toolkit on Local Public
Private Partnerships in Crime and Violence Prevention.



Furthermore, the Bank will prepare technical policy notes to promote and operationalize
multi-sectoral approaches that address the key risky behaviors of youth, including: school
dropout during adolescence, participation in gangs and other groups, risky sexual behavior,
and substance abuse. The approach will be to adapt successful programs in the
country/region, such as the Mi Primer Empleo youth training program, the full time school
model, youth-friendly clinics, slum upgrading, etc., to the Honduran context.

66.
Result 1.2 Linking national interventions to Regional (i.e., across Central America)
approaches on citizen security. Key institutional capacity challenges across Central America
are impeding the implementation of an integrated approach to reducing crime and violence. The
Bank’s efforts in this area will be designed not only to increase awareness, skills, and new
implementation know-how, but also to inspire partnerships and coalitions, and build consensus.
A series of IDF grants will be used to strengthen the capacity of SICA and high-level entities
across Central American in the area of crime and violence prevention. South-South knowledge
exchange or peer-to-peer learning will also be deployed, with the support of the World Bank
Institute (WBI), tapping into a wide array of knowledge exchange instruments, including
dialogues, peer consultations, and study visits. These efforts would complement the South-South
Cooperation Program already put in place by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Honduras, which
focuses on Central America and the Caribbean, and on the specific issues of citizen security,
21

vocational training for youth at risk, community and rural development, and agricultural
development. This CPS also provides for an opportunity to explore a possible Central America
Regional operation for violence prevention, the specific scope to be defined at a later stage. A
Nordic Trust Fund on Links between Human Rights and Crime and Violence in Central America
will also support the Honduran program through the end of 2011.
Strategic Objective Two—Expanding Opportunities through Reducing Vulnerabilities
67.
Overview. Accelerating broad-based growth remains of fundamental importance for
Honduras, particularly as poverty remains high and growth has been low since the global crisis
of 2008-09. The second strategic objective of this CPS thus focuses on expanding opportunities
through reducing vulnerabilities grouped in three areas—economic, social, and climatic.
Economic Vulnerabilities
68.
Result 2.1 Improved fiscal consolidation. The CPS intends to continue supporting
Government efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability and to consolidate its fiscal position.
This will entail a number of related but distinct reforms.


Via tax administration policy reforms. These reforms are expected to lead to higher Central
Government tax collection by expanding the tax base and ensuring greater compliance,
measures to make customs and tax administration more effective, adoption of legislation on
transfer pricing and a tax procedural code, the creation of the office of control of tax
exemptions, and the application of rules of origin in customs.



Via pension reforms. A core reform this CPS supports relates to improving the financial
sustainability of Honduras’ contingent liabilities in terms of social security and pensions. The
financial situation of INPREMA and INJUPEMP, which are currently projected to run
massive deficits, are of key concern. The changes introduced in the laws are expected to
provide a solid base and cash flow consolidation, which in turn will substantially reduce the
projected deficits for both institutions and stabilize their net worth in real terms.



Via sustainability of wage bill. Achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill remains a crucial
challenge for Honduras. Steady increases in teachers’ pay and benefits in 2006-2009,
combined with ineffective controls over the creation of new posts and payroll management,
pushed personnel expenditures to 11 percent of GDP. The Bank will provide technical
assistance to develop and implement measures which provide improved medium term
predictability and control over the wage bill and avoid an upward spiral.



Via improving efficiency of utilities. The National Power Utility (ENEE) has massive
financial losses annually, an unsustainable subsidy system, and an outdated management
system. The Bank will continue to work with ENEE to help modernize the utility to enable it
to both reduce its technical losses and improve service quality.

69.
The main instruments that the Bank Program will deploy to achieve these results is the
two-part programmatic Reducing Vulnerabilities for Growth Development Policy Credit series in
FYs12 and 13 and the ongoing Power Sector Efficiency Enhancement Project.
22

70.
Result 2.2 Improved investment climate and competitiveness. The issue of
competitiveness and ability to attract foreign direct investment is prominent in the Government’s
development agenda. The Bank has been providing technical advice to Honduras over the past
year on key reforms on multiple fronts which can contribute to an improved enabling
environment for business.


Via support to business reforms. At the request of the Government, the FPD Investment
Climate Practice of the Bank Group (a joint IFC-Bank practice) will continue to provide
analytical technical services during the CPS. The planned business enabling environment
work will build on the results of the recently-closed Honduras Trade Facilitation Project.
The project made important gains in times and costs to start a business and obtain
construction permits. IFC Investment Climate Advisory Services and the FPD Investment
Climate Practice will continue to provide support to improve agribusiness trade logistics and
to facilitate the effective implementation of the competition policy framework initially
developed under the Trade Facilitation Project. Furthermore, the Bank’s Central America
Competitiveness and Integration Study, due to be completed in FY12, will contribute
recommendations on microeconomic reforms to improve export competitiveness, strengthen
value chains, foster rural productivity, and promote regional economic integration. IFC will
continue to explore demand for its financial as well as advisory services and tailor its
program of support accordingly over this CPS period particularly related to Public Private
Partnerships in infrastructure related projects and Doing Business Reform Advisory (DBRA)
– the latter aimed at reducing inefficiencies in the areas measured by Doing Business.



Via rural productivity. Given that the majority of the rural poor in Honduras work in the
agriculture sector, the Bank will continue to support the development of agricultural value
chains and productivity-enhancing initiatives for rural businesses through implementation of
the IDA-financed Rural Competitiveness Project and JSDF for Microenterprise Development
for the Poor and Indigenous People. In agribusiness, IFC is focusing on competitive export
sectors as well as processed foods and in addition to having approved loans in the palm oil
and sugar sectors, is pursuing opportunities in coffee, dairy, and beverages.



Via financial sector strengthening. The financial sector has improved significantly its
prudential indicators since 2008 and, as credit growth starts to pick up, strengthening the
sector becomes particularly important. The Bank will continue its support to help modernize
Honduras’ banking sector by providing technical assistance in the operationalization of the
new financial payments system through the ongoing Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Credit. Additionally, MIGA has supported a US$6.2 million risk guarantee to ProCredit
Holding of Germany to help capitalize its Honduran subsidiaries that provide SME loans, and
stands ready to continue guarantees in Honduras. IFC is contributing to strengthening the
local banking system by supporting the capital structure of systemic banks with equity and
subordinated debt investments. IFC will continue to deepen its ongoing engagement with
financial institutions with suitable investment and comprehensive advisory service programs
to enhance performance in risk management, strategic planning, SMEs and Sustainable
Energy Financing.



Via addressing logistics. Honduras struggles with both the quantity and quality of its
infrastructure. These types of logistics constraints and resulting poor connectivity hinder the
23

competitiveness of Honduran products in the international market. The Bank will continue
implementation of its Second Road Reconstruction and Improvement Project and Rural
Infrastructure Project to help meet the deficits in this area, while the Bank and the IFC will
explore opportunities for expanded Public Private Partnerships. IFC Investment Climate
Advisory Services and the FPD Investment Climate Practice plan to support greater regional
integration by developing a regional Central American Trade Logistics project, which will
start with a pilot phase between Honduras and El Salvador to harmonize requirements and
risk management products for trading across borders. The Bank will deliver its regional
Central America Logistics Study, which will explore the major factors that need to be
addressed to help Honduras and its Central American neighbors surmount the logistics
constraints to accessing markets.


Via energy investments. The Bank is finalizing a US$30m investment plan for the Scaling
Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) in conjunction with the IFC and IDB. The grant
facility–one of the Climate Investment Funds–will support (i) strengthening of the national
regulatory framework; (ii) the development of renewable energy connections to the grid and;
(iii) rural electrification through small-scale renewable sources. This complements ongoing
Bank lending in the energy sector, including the IDA credit for the Power Sector Efficiency
Enhancement (US$27.6m) and a US$13 million component for off-grid solar electrification
through the Rural Infrastructure Project. IFC is working alongside local banks to develop
mezzanine or risk-sharing facilities to reach small renewable energy projects, enabling it to
support directly projects greater than 10MW.



Via better land tenure security. Many Hondurans lack land tenure security. Weak property
rights have discouraged investments and restricted access to credit, constraining SME
development. The Bank has been engaged in strengthening the cadastral land registration
system for a decade given its important contribution to empowering the rural poor including
indigenous peoples. The Land Administration APL Program (PATH) and associated Trust
Funds provide vehicles to continue this long-term partnership.

Social Vulnerabilities
71.
Result 2.3 Improved quality of education. A key issue in the education sector in
Honduras is the poor learning outcomes of the children who attend school, improvement in
which would be an important requirement for Honduras to position itself as an economy with a
high quality labor force as it competes for international investments. Given that the constraints to
improving learning outcomes are institutional or policy-related, and that the Government is
attempting to undertake significant reforms in the area of teacher accreditation, numbers of days
of schooling, teacher census, classroom observation of the quality of teaching, etc., the Bank in
this next CPS period is expecting to support education through policy dialogue and reform. This
will be undertaken in the context of the proposed programmatic DPC and through technical
assistance (country and Regional). The ongoing Education Quality, Governance and Institutions
Project will continue to work to increase the coverage, quality, accountability and governance of
the basic education system. IFC also aims to begin investing in colleges and adult education
providers, building on its success in this sector elsewhere in Latin America which have focused
principally on low- and middle-income groups.

24

72.
Result 2.4 Consolidated and strengthened social protection system. The Government
has indicated its commitment to strengthen the social protection system of Honduras to address
its objective of reducing extreme poverty. The Bank is supporting the Bono 10,000 Conditional
Cash Transfer (CCT) program launched in 2010 by the current administration. The program,
supported by the ongoing Bank Social Protection Project, builds on successful experiences such
as Oportunidades in Mexico and Bolsa Familia in Brazil. The eligible population for this
Program ultimately comprises the approximately 600,000 extremely poor families with children
aged 0 to 59 months, children in primary school (grades 1 to 6), and pregnant mothers. These
families represent about 87 percent of all extremely poor families. Moreover, a large share of
households currently benefiting from the program has indigenous background. By end-2011, the
Program is expected to cover about 300,000 families living in extreme poverty.
Climatic Vulnerabilities
73.
Result 2.5 More effective disaster risk management (DRM). While other agencies (see
Annex 6) have programmed substantial resources for DRM in Honduras, the bulk of these
resources are for an emergency response. In contrast, the Bank will continue to focus on disaster
preparedness, at national and at local municipality levels, via ongoing Trust Funds for the
Regional CAPRA and CEPREDENAC initiatives to improve risk assessment capacity of national
institutions. Moreover, the frequent overlapping of different types of risks—climatic, crime,
poverty, and social exclusion—in the same localities suggest that there is need to consider an
integrated Urban Vulnerability Reduction Project. The proposed project would scale up the
Disaster Risk Mitigation Project (closed FY11) and Barrio Ciudad by deploying neighborhood
and city-based vulnerability reduction measures. It would likely entail small to medium
investments, local planning capacity building, and social interventions (see also paragraph 65,
seventh bullet). Discussions are also ongoing with the Honduran authorities on whether there
may be need for further restructuring of existing operations (e.g. Rural Infrastructure) to include
support for reconstruction efforts following the torrential rains of mid-October 2011.
Furthermore, ongoing and new operations will be reviewed to ascertain whether there are
simple, high-impact DRM measures that could be incorporated (e.g. flood-proofing of roads).
74.
In order to facilitate Honduras’ access to climate change resources, e.g., the Green Fund
and the Adaptation Fund, the Bank team will assist Honduras to identify and/or build capacity in
an appropriate implementing entity.
Strategic Objective Three—Enhancing Good Governance
75.
Overview. Though important reforms were supported under the preceding CAS in the
governance sector and projects met their development objectives, many cross-cutting challenges
persist, calling for a sustained engagement in a broader framework on good governance. Hence
the third strategic objective of the proposed new CPS is enhancing good governance, focusing on
improved capacity of state institutions, decentralized delivery of services, and demand-side
governance approaches.
76.
Result 3.1 Improved accountability in public expenditures. The Government has
confirmed its strong interest in continuing efforts initiated over the past few years in
modernization of public sector management systems, particularly public financial management,
25

procurement, and results monitoring and evaluation capacity. To support this area under the
CPS, a key instrument will be the new Improved Public Sector Performance Project. This
project represents the continuation of a long-standing engagement by the Bank in strengthening
core government institutions through successive operations (including the latest PRSTAC
operation which closed in December 2010). Support will also be provided via the JSDF Grant
for Improving Public Accountability and IDF grants Building Trust in Public Policies and Public
Institutions and Strengthening Congressional Oversight that are expected to become operational
in FY12. The Bank will also continue to support the Quick Gains Initiative on procurement
reforms that has already elicited significant returns to Honduras.
77.
Result 3.2 Stronger decentralized structures. One of the most important ways in which
the Government intends to strengthen the delivery and accountability of public services is by
strengthening decentralized administrative structures such as municipalities and
mancomunidades (associations of smaller municipalities). The assessment of implementation
experience under the Bank’s CAS Completion Report also highlights the potential gains to be
made by strengthening the capacities and role of decentralized entities. The Bank will contribute
to this overall effort by analyzing the fiscal, financing, and service delivery framework of
decentralized tiers of government in order to help address questions of value-for-money and
financial sustainability, as well as to help inform the development of an appropriate
decentralization strategy for Honduras. A key Bank instrument in this regard will be the Public
Expenditure Review for Honduras which will be focused on decentralization.
78.
A particular area of sustained Bank engagement in decentralized service delivery will be
in the water and sanitation sector. Recent advances in decentralized implementation of services
have been observed in this sector. Nonetheless, Honduras faces a number of challenges in
implementing effective policies, regulation, and financing of decentralized water and sanitation
systems. Accordingly, the Bank will provide support to this area through various means,
including its ongoing Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project, the associated Global
Program for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) project in Water, a Spanish Trust Fund (SFLAC) to
explore ways to strengthen integrated urban water management in the greater Tegucigalpa area,
and a Water expenditure analysis (Box 3).

Box 3. Expenditure Analysis for the Water and Sanitation Sector in Honduras
The Bank has initiated a Water Public Expenditure Review (WaPER) to evaluate how the country is
investing in the water sector and how the decentralization of water sector has had an impact on the
public expenditures, equity, and efficiency of the sector. In particular, it aims to answer the following
questions: (i) the absolute and relative allocations to the sector over time, including capital investment
as well as recurrent expenditure, different levels of government, urban versus rural and types of
investment, and sources of investment; (ii) the effects of public funding on the sector targets such as
coverage and quality of service; (iii) the level of cost recovery in the sector and the analysis of both
explicit and implicit subsidy; (iv) sector financing at the local government in the decentralized
environment; (v) the effects of decentralization of water sector on sector investment in selected sample
municipalities; and (vi) key findings and policy implication for the sector investment

26

79.
The Bank will also continue to strengthen the infrastructure base of municipalities as well
as their ability to manage core services through the ongoing Rural Infrastructure Project, the
Power Sector Efficiency Project, and the related GEF for Rural Electrification. The IFC has also
initiated support to Tegucigalpa through a risk-sharing facility with local banks to support the
city’s infrastructure needs. If this arrangement is found to have succeeded, it will show the way
to extend the possibility of IFC working with sub-national entities in Honduras.
80.
Result 3.3 Enhanced social accountability as part of demand-driven governance.
There is weak capacity of civil society to use available information to hold public service
providers and policy makers more accountable. In turn, this constrains efforts to strengthen trust
in public policies and institutions. The WBG, under the leadership of its Country Office in
Honduras, will support this agenda through small Civil Society Grants to CSOs in areas such as
participatory budgeting, developing community scorecards related to the provision of selected
services, etc. The Quality of Education Project and the JSDF on Piloting New Forms of
Community-Administered Education for Socially Vulnerable Communities in Honduras will
support community-based school management models as means to enhance citizen oversight
measures in the education sector. In addition, the WBG will ascertain how to better support
mainstreaming of demand-side transparency and accountability tools in its portfolio of
operations.
Proposed Program of Support
81.
There will be a strong degree of continuity from the preceding CAS and emphasis
on implementation of the existing portfolio. Given the delays incurred in portfolio
implementation due to the political crisis and subsequent pause, many projects are expected to
enter into their main activity cycle during the new CPS period. Thus, implementation of the
ongoing portfolio will be critical to achieving CPS results for the FY12-14 period. IFC will also
continue to explore demand and expand its program in Honduras.
82.
New loans will be frontloaded in FYs 12 and 13 to better respond to client demands
and facilitate implementation start-up before the start of the next political cycle. At the
request of the Government, IDA will frontload its support for Honduras for FY12 and FY13
given that the Government expects to require the most financing during these two years. Barring
any shocks and the emergence of new financing priorities, as the fiscal stabilization measures
mature over time lower financing needs are expected in FY14 (also a year of political transition).
83.
An indicative lending pipeline is presented (in Table 3). It is, however, subject to
change in the priorities of the Government within the framework of this CPS, and to the
occurrence of shocks which may necessitate a re-ordering of priorities.2 Furthermore, should
Honduras become eligible to receive IBRD resources, the financing pipeline of IDA and IBRD
combined will be updated to the Board.

2

The amounts shown in FY13-14 are indicative only. Actual IDA allocations will depend on: (i) the country’s own
performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources
available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; and (v) the amount of compensatory
resources received for MDRI.
27

84.
An emphasis of this CPS will be on programmatic analytical and technical services.
Given the long-term nature of several of the development challenges facing Honduras (e.g. on
governance, competitiveness, crime and violence), there is clear need for long-term engagement
that may or may not involve direct financing. The AAA program envisaged for this CPS is also
indicated in Table 3.

En-Gendering the Development Impact of the CPS Program
85.
The existing portfolio is addressing gender issues in most operations, although there
are opportunities to strengthen the focus going forward. An operation where the design is
gender-informed is the Nutrition and Social Protection project, which mentions indirect gender
differentiated effects on youth violence, and includes gender indicators to enable monitoring of
progress on children and youth in the project. The Project also incorporates a Participatory
Indigenous, Afro-descendant Peoples and Gender Plan (IPDP). Based on experience in similar
programs it is expected that the conditional incentives in the Social Protection Project will lead
to increased school enrolment among girls, reduced child labor, and increased use of primary
health care services. In addition, by providing the cash transfers directly to mothers, the Bono
Program will empower them to have more control over intra-household spending decisions as
well as enhance their financial literacy being exposed to innovative payment mechanisms (e.g.
mobile banking). The Barrio-Ciudad Project includes activities to reduce gender-based
violence, while the programmatic DPC, as part of the support to the prevention pillar of the
national citizen security strategy, will also foster initiatives to reduce gender-based violence. The
Road Reconstruction & Improvement II Project will conduct a study on female participation in
its micro-enterprise program. The Rural Competitiveness Project seeks to enhance women’s
participation in productive activities and decision making through its capacity-building activities,
particularly in rural areas of the project intervention.
86.
During implementation the CPS will further elaborate ways to support the focus on
gender issues. The Bank’s Country Office is participating in the Gender donor group in
Honduras and will work in collaboration with other partners to identify gaps where the Bank’s
input, whether technical or otherwise, may be most useful. Finally, the Country Team will
continue its review of operations in the Bank’s Honduras portfolio to assess where further
gender-sensitive design and/or monitoring and evaluation efforts are needed and support
restructuring of the operation if needed to address identified gaps and opportunities.
Box 4. Gender is Central to the Honduras Land Administration Program
The second phase of the Honduras Land Administration Program APL, PATH includes a Gender
Strategy, building on a Social Assessment and a Gender Audit. The Gender Strategy includes a plan to
promote Miskito women’s participation in the process of recognition of their communities’ collective
land rights. The strategy was prepared with support from the Gender Action Plan (GAP)-financed
initiative, Improving Land Tenure for Women in Honduras which aimed to improve women’s access
to land in Honduras by: (i) promoting greater attention to gender issues throughout Program activities,
(ii) developing a tool to facilitate and promote joint land titling, and (iii) providing capacity building
for PATH staff and for government agencies, local governments, women’s organizations and NGOs
working on land administration issues. Accordingly, 13 workshops were conducted across Honduras.
Gender is also reflected in Phase II’s Results Matrix: (a) total number of female beneficiaries; (b) At
least 50,000 families in rural and urban areas complete process to obtain new land titles through the
Project (of which at least 30% are women); (c) at least 70% of women rate modernized registry
services as "satisfactory"; (d) 80 Miskito community leaders trained on alternative conflict resolution
mechanisms (of which at least 20 are women); and (e) 80 community leaders trained on territorial
planning and natural resource management (of which at least 20 are women). Finally, Phase II will
include at least one impact study to measure the gender-equity impact of the program’s procedures.

29

Managing the Program
87.
The strategic objectives and key results of the CPS outlined above have been
elaborated into a full CPS results matrix (see Annex 2). Given the limited number of new
interventions under this CPS, the results matrix reflects in large measure the ongoing portfolio of
operations. Particular care was taken to avoid direct one-to-one or exaggerated attribution of
country results to the Bank Program per se. Rather, the matrix aims to signal positive movement
towards long-term development goals in areas of focus for the CPS. Regarding the new and
significant set of knowledge products outlined above, the Bank team will be working closely
with the Bank and LAC-wide Knowledge Task Forces to better define methodologies and
approaches to measuring impact.
88.
Quality assurance mechanisms for the implementation of the portfolio will be led by
the Bank’s Honduras Country Office, with full support from the CMU unit at headquarters. Key
tools will be close dialogue with Government and other stakeholders, CPPRs, tailored training
for government implementation counterparts, and selected individual task reviews conducted
proactively for projects where issues of concern are flagged during project supervision. The
CMU will continue to fully finance supervision budgets of all approved projects, together with
the requirements for their social, environmental, and fiduciary safeguards.
Fostering Partnerships
89.
There is an active international donor community in Honduras, with well-defined
areas of focus for each development partner. The Bank through its Country Office
participates in local sector coordination groups and the G-16 (group of 16 development
partners). Also, the Bank is an active member of the donor group “Friends of Central America,”
which seeks to coordinate donor activities in the area of citizen security in Central America.
Annex 6 provides a summary overview of the financing program of the four largest international
development partners in Honduras. In the context of this CPS’s focus on selectivity, the
significant financial commitments and technical engagement of these partners in core
development areas has helped the Bank to both coordinate its interventions and focus its new
financing in fewer areas. Other key partnerships that the Bank will continue to foster is with
civil society and with the private sector, through a mix of outreach mechanisms (e.g.
consultations, small grants for CSOs).
90.
It is also important to mention that the Bank manages significant amounts of
resources for other donors in the form of Trust Funds. These resources can be substantial and
for Honduras, as of October 31, 2011, they amounted to approximately US$10 million in
undisbursed resources. In the proposed CPS, consistent with the revised approach of the Bank,
all Trust Funds will be managed as essential parts of an integrated country strategy.
91.
Finally, the Bank will also support the development of broader partnerships. A key
tool in this regard will be South-South Learning, with the active participation of WBI.

30

VI.

MANAGING RISKS

92.
Managing fiscal risks will remain a challenge during the CPS period. While the
current Government has already demonstrated commitment to taking the difficult steps to rein in
the fiscal deficit, Honduras’ fiscal situation remains tenuous and vulnerable to shocks. The
Bank’s lending program going forward has at its core a programmatic DPC series which has
fiscal consolidation as one of its pillars, providing a framework for focused dialogue with
Government on pertinent areas. Furthermore, the Bank will maintain close dialogue with the
Government and the Fund to anticipate any adverse developments in this regard.
93.
Violence and crime are likely to continue to escalate. Given the strength of the
criminal organizations and the institutional weaknesses in Honduras, crime and violence is likely
to remain the top development challenge. The actions of the Government even if in the right
direction and well targeted will reasonably take time to have an impact. The Bank’s approach
will be to help the Government target impact through multi-faceted interventions focused on
prevention, and to bring about greater strategic coherence to bear on this objective over time.
94.
There is need to closely observe the political dynamics in the country and maintain
an open dialogue with all political parties. The ability of the current administration to deliver
on key priorities and to maintain its stance of national reconciliation will be important to help
consolidate the strength of state institutions. The Bank will monitor implementation of its
Program with attention to political economy dimensions and periodically review with
Government and others options designed to overcome constraints in this regard. Emphasis will
be given to actions that support the enlargement of the pro-reform constituencies with a focus on
demand driven good governance initiatives.
95.
Honduras is one of the most vulnerable countries to climatic shocks in the world.
The CPS recognizes this and proposes to mainstream disaster risk preparedness measures into its
portfolio in addition to providing key technical and financial support to Honduras in terms of
strengthening its capacity to engage in disaster risk management. In the context of a disaster, the
Bank will revisit its planned lending program and existing portfolio to ascertain how and where
adjustments need to be made to support the country’s reconstruction efforts.

Executive Overview

96.
The 2007-2010 World Bank-Honduras Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was
executed under especially challenging circumstances. The country experienced costly natural
disasters, a food, fuel and global financial crisis, and political conflict that was followed by
President Manuel Zelaya’s removal from office. At the culmination of this CAS period, the
Bank prepared an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) with an amended results framework, which
provided the new government time to focus its strategic priorities. This completion report
evaluates both the 2007-2010 CAS as well as the 2011 ISN based upon the amended results
framework.
97.
The delivery of the program is rated as moderately unsatisfactory as only some CAS
results were met, while others are on the way to being met. Delivery of expected CAS results
is notable in the areas of governance and transparency, strengthening of the business climate,
infrastructure investments, disaster risk preparedness and the establishment of a national social
protection program. Despite success in meeting expected CAS results, it is troubling to note that
key national development indicators, notably involving poverty, corruption and governance,
youth employment and crime and violence have worsened, indicating a need for renewed
reflection on how to best contribute to national development goals.
98.
Bank Group performance can be rated as moderately satisfactory given its
proactive response to the evolving political and economic conditions and its attentiveness to
portfolio supervision. The Bank worked with each administration to design suitable responses
to the shifting challenges using budget support, specific investment loans, grant facilities and
AAA. During each crisis, the Bank response to country needs as well as evolving government
priorities included delivery of operations not foreseen in the original CAS. Still, the Bank
remained focused on its projects in many strategic development areas. It also took steps to
protect its portfolio from external shocks which enabled progress towards CAS and project result
indicators in most areas of engagement.

II.

Development Outcomes

99.
The exogenous shocks that affected Honduras in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted
economic performance. A tropical depression struck on October 16, 2008 as the country
struggled to cope with rising food and fuel prices. Honduras was then hit particularly hard by the
global financial crisis, as its economy is largely export driven, with high vulnerability to shifts in
the global economy and oil prices. As a result of the crisis the economy contracted by 2.1% in
2009. The combined public sector deficit increased to 4.6% in 2009. The 2009 political turmoil
further compromised the nation’s dramatic fiscal situation.
100. However, the Honduran economy slowly recovered. Increases in commodity prices
and a slight increase in remittances stimulated economic recovery in Honduras in 2010.
According to the Honduran Central Bank, the economy grew by 2.9% in 2010. A Standby
Agreement with the IMF for $202 million was signed in October 2010 to support the country’s
efforts to restore macroeconomic and fiscal stability. Economic growth for the first quarter of
2011 was 2.4%, registering an increase in inflation at 6.5%. The fiscal deficit dropped to 2.9%
of GDP in 2010, and is expected to be maintained at 3.1% of GDP in 2011, according to the most
recent IMF projections. The Government’s medium-term fiscal framework aims to lower the
deficit to 2% of GDP by 2012. A Debt Sustainability Analysis, prepared jointly by the Bank and
the IMF suggests that Honduras’ public debt is on a sustainable trajectory.
101. The compounded effects of the global financial crisis and the domestic political crisis
stalled poverty reduction efforts. As a result of the various crises, the Honduran economy
experienced average real GDP growth of 2.8% over the past four years, slightly higher than its
population growth. The decline in remittances also negatively affected the poor. According to
the National Statistics Institute, extreme poverty increased from 36.2% of the population in 2008
to 36.4% in 2009 and 39.1% in 2010. In 2009, national unemployment rose to 38.7%, yet female
unemployment was notably higher at 48.4% and national youth unemployment reached 49.5%.
Progress towards meeting MDGs was mixed; the country is on track to meeting many goals, but
notably lacking with respect to education. While literacy rates improved from 88.9% in 2001 to
93.9% in 2007, there is a strong gender performance bias favoring women. In 2005, 35% of
Hondurans lived in urban slums.
102. The worsening state of crime and violence in Honduras became the primary concern
of the government and hindered the country’s economic development. In 2010, the homicide
rate in Honduras reached 78 per 100,000 inhabitants, up from 50 per 100,000 inhabitants in
2007. Honduras, like its Central American neighbors has seen these rates rise systematically
since 2004.4 The economic costs of crime and violence in Honduras represented about 9.6% of
Honduras’ GDP or $885 million dollars per year and the Bank estimated that reducing homicide
rates by 10% could boost annual economic growth by 0.7%5. Youth violence and youth gangs
remain a key problem, with over 30% of homicide victims aged 15-34, and with estimates of
approximately 112 gangs (with approximately 36,000 members) existing in Honduras.

A rate of more than 10 per 100,000 inhabitants is considered an epidemic by WHO.

103. Recent political events highlighted the magnitude of the governance impediments in
Honduras, despite some gains. In recent years, Honduras worked to improve governance
conditions, particularly by focusing on strengthening its institutional framework; however,
progress has been slower than expected.6 This was compounded further by an environment of
conflict, insecurity, deterioration of trust in public institutions among many sectors of Honduran
society, and exacerbated social tensions. The 2009 political crisis should not be understood as an
isolated event; rather, it can be considered to have been a reflection of the country’s deep-seated,
unresolved governance challenge.
104. The removal of President Zelaya from office tested the institutional foundations of
the country. President Manuel Zelaya assumed office on January 27, 2006. He ratified the
CAFTA-DR free trade agreement, maintaining the country’s strong trade ties with the US.
President Zelaya also signed the Transparency and Access to Information Law, which improved
openness in many aspects of Honduran government. President Zelaya was elected as a
moderately left-leaning candidate, but he moved to the far-left end of the political spectrum. On
June 28, 2009, President Zelaya was removed from office after he tried to conduct a national
survey that, if successful, would have created an enabling environment for him to conduct a
further referendum on whether or not to convene a Constitutent Assembly, possibly allowing him
to be reelected. Congress approved Roberto Micheletti as interim President through what would
have been the end of President Zelaya’s term. Along with most development partners, the Bank
“paused” operations in Honduras during the interim period, pursuant to Operational Policy 7.30,
resuming disbursements in December 2009.
105. On November 29, 2009, national elections took place and Porfirio Lobo, from the
National Party, won with 55 percent of votes cast. Following his inauguration as President on
January 27, 2010, Mr. Lobo named a Government of national reconciliation that included some
political rivals, and quickly set about reengaging with the international community and
development partners. The political situation remains a problem and the fractious nature of the
unity government has posed additional challenges to the implementation of national reforms and
certain government programs. However, this reconciliation has made progress and Mel Zelaya
peacefully returned to Honduras in May 2011.
III.

Program Performance

106. During this CAS period, the country experienced notable delays delivering on the
CAS agenda, but progress was made toward achieving most indicators. In each of the CAS
pillars, progress was achieved which set the basis for accomplishing CAS goals. However, in
certain cases, progress was underwhelming and certain indicators were not met.

6

Advances made in recent years include: the approval and implementation of the Law on Transparency and Access
to Information; the initial implementation of a Results-based Management System; the expansion and improvement
of the use of SIAFI, as well as a public financial management (PFM) reform program.
34

CAS Pillar One: Equitable Economic Growth for Employment Generation
Strengthening Fiscal Accounts and Competitiveness
107. This CAS pillar assisted in: (i) reducing public wage pressure and increasing fiscal
revenues, (ii) strengthening competitiveness and effectiveness in the areas of finance,
energy, water, sanitation, roads and business competitiveness, and (iii) increasing rural
incomes. After the political crisis, the Bank program helped balance the fiscal accounts and
addressed systemic macroeconomic challenges, including high public wage pressures and low
tax revenues. The $76.3m Emergency Recovery Development Policy Credit (DPC), approved in
2011, helped the government mitigate fiscal challenges while addressing underlying structural
issues. The Credit supported public sector human resource reforms, reform of the electricity
utility, ENEE’s tariff structure and eliminated much of its restrictive debt. These changes were
approved by the Honduran Congress and have already led to increased government revenue and
an expected reduction in government wages to below 10 percent of GDP.
108. World Bank TA and IFC interventions strengthened the resilience of the financial
sector.
The Financial Sector Technical Assistance project launched new institutional
arrangements within the Central Bank to control systemic risks and reduce the risk of moneylaundering. In financial markets, IFC supported banks with trade finance facilities, specialpurpose facilities to reach SMEs, housing finance, supported microfinance institutions and
selectively sought equity opportunities to further capitalize local financial institutions. MIGA
supported a $6.2m risk guarantee to ProCredit Holding of Germany to help capitalize its
Honduran subsidiaries that provide SME loans.
109. IDA and IFC interventions supported an improved business climate in Honduras.
The Trade Facilitation Project, which closed in FY10 and since March 2009, IFC Advisory
Services worked to further improve the investment climate. The reforms include the creation of
a one-stop shop to make foreign business registration more efficient, the simplification of
municipal licensing for starting a business and for requesting a construction permit. The
Government agreed upon a reform memo and action plans for prioritized investment topics with
IFC. The time to start a business indicator improved dramatically, from 44 days in 2007 to 14
days in 2011. The days to process a construction permit fell from 184 in 2007 to 106 in 2011,
while days to register property fell from 36 to 23 days between the same period. The Trade
Facilitation project’s support for the Competition Policy Law enabled more than 35 economic
concentration cases7 to be resolved by the new Commission for the Defense and Promotion of
Competition. In addition, Foreign Direct Investment promotion work led to 33 new foreign
investments of US$60m which created over 5,000 jobs. The establishment of national quality
institutions – the Office Accreditation, the Honduran Metrology Center and the Honduran
Standards Organization – led to the accreditation of 11 laboratories, 2,000 equipment calibrations
and the publication of 69 standards.

Infrastructure Sector Investments and Reforms
110. Infrastructure investments represent the largest portion of the Honduras portfolio,
with significant road, electricity, water and sanitation investments made in both urban and
rural areas, supported by a number of Bank instruments. WBG engagement supported
sector-wide reforms and investments in urban and peri-urban areas as well as in rural Honduras.
Some projects were multi-sectoral, such as the Rural Infrastructure and Barrio-Ciudad projects
that invested in the road, electricity, water and sanitation sectors in the rural and urban contexts,
respectively. The positive results achieved under Rural Infrastructure Project encouraged the
government to scale up the project (already supported with counterpart funding from the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration) as a national program. The ISN disengaged from the
telecom sector given significant roadblocks to the passage of key sector legislation (though the
PRS TAC project worked somewhat to influence the policy dialogue).
111. The Bank became the lead development partner in the water and sanitation sector
through investments and support to a systematic multi-year and multi-instrument reform
agenda. The 2006 PPIAF grant supporting the government with a plan to implement the 2003
water and sanitation decentralization law was followed by the Water and Sanitation Sector
Modernization Project (PROMOSAS) that has already supported decentralization of water and
sanitation utilities in 6 large municipalities. The PROMOSAS project was complemented by the
Global Program for Output Based Aid (GPOBA) $4.4m grant facility, which worked in
municipalities and with private providers to pay for results-based expansion of water and
sanitation services and has already expanded service to more than 10,000 households. The Rural
Infrastructure Project installed water connections to 26,000 persons and latrines to 12,000 rural
beneficiaries, while the Barrio Ciudad project ensured 100% access to water and sanitation
services in the three of the seven urban neighborhoods where the project has been completed. A
GAC-financed grant promoted stronger accountability mechanisms for municipal water
operators. An Spanish Trust Fund (SFLAC) grant was approved in 2010 to explore a municipal
management approach to Tegucigalpa’s water sector, which is not covered by the PROMOSAS
project, but whose aging infrastructure – which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Mitch in
1999 – urgently requires new investment. These impacts have been gradual, but built upon and
complemented one another, and provide a clear path for sector engagement going forward.
112. Investments in the road sector represented the largest percentage of the Bank
portfolio and financed the government’s highway fund, supporting maintenance of the
national primary road network and expansion of the rural network. However, because of
lacking government weight controls, road maintenance costs were much higher than originally
envisioned. Further, because procurement challenges in this sector, many of the major contracts
were not signed for the combined $73.6m project. The Rural Infrastructure project worked with
mancomunidades (groupings of several smaller communities under a single project
administration) across Honduras to identify and upgrade8 more than 150km of rural roads with
commitments for the remaining 250km to be upgraded by project closing in 2012. IFC also
worked with subnationals in the infrastructure sector and approved a $15.9 million risk-sharing
facility with local banks to finance Tegucigalpa’s 2010-11 $44 million investment program in
road infrastructure and public transportation improvement. If successful, this program could
8

Roads upgraded to improved gravel standard.
36

scale to other communities. This subnational support was in part supported by CMU-led grants
into subnational financial markets, which enabled IDA and IFC involvement in the sector.
113. In the electricity sector, the Bank supported the reform of the state-owned
electricity utility, ENEE, helped expand connectivity in off-grid, rural communities and
invested in public lighting as part of its slum upgrading initiative. The 2010 DPC moved the
electricity agenda ahead by supporting tariff structure reform which led to $5.6m in increased
revenues in 2010 and a reduction of ENEE’s debt. A GEF grant supported the installation of
thousands of off-grid solar panels in homes and schools. Barrio-Ciudad’s public lighting
investments led to measured improvements in perceived safety in communities across the
country. The PROMEF Electricity Sector project did not have an impact during this CAS
period, as it took 18 months to become effective and then struggled to define implementation
arrangements.
Rural Development and Productivity
114. Progress has been made toward improving property rights through an extended
network of property registration offices; and, broad efforts were put in place to support
rural incomes. The Bank has been involved in national land administration reform since 1995
and the Honduran Land Administration Program (PATH) project led to the registration of more
than 100,000 new land parcels. After a successful intervention of improved property rights by
expanding land cadastre in the PATH project, the Bank prepared a supplementary operation
(APL II) and after mobilizing $32.8m additional IDA 15 resources and the project was approved
by the Board on June 30, 2011.
115. The Bank supported agricultural productive projects through the Rural
Competitive Program (COMRURAL) and IFC investments. COMRURAL, approved in
2008, only became effective in 2010 and therefore the indicators involving rural productive
alliances were not met. Yet progress was underway, with more than 3,000 rural producers
participating in approved business plans. In agribusiness, IFC is focusing on competitive export
sectors as well as processed foods. IFC approved loans in the palm oil and sugar sectors, and is
pursuing opportunities with coffee, dairy, and beverages.

37

CAS Pillar Two: Good Governance through State Modernization and Civic Participation
116. Transparency and public expenditure modernization systems were launched, but
not yet achieving the scope expected, meaning that many of the reforms enacted lack
national impact. Implementation of the governance agenda has proceeded with some notable
achievements such as the passage of the Transparency and Access to Public Information law,
supported by the Bank, which is amongst the most progressive in Latin America. However,
enforcement of the law was limited. Despite reforms, Transparency International rated Honduras
among the countries in the Region with the highest corruption. The disconnect between project
performance and original project outcomes also suggests that the status of governance
achievements under the CAS is still frail and that it would be prudent for the Bank to revisit how
best to deliver support for the governance agenda in the new CPS.
117. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Technical Assistance Credit (PRS TAC), the
keystone of the Bank’s engagement on the governance agenda, and its predecessor, the
Economic and Financial Management Project were important tools for dialogue on
governance. PRS-TAC contributed to the upgrading of the Ministry of Finance’s SIAFI system
of public finance tracking and control, developing a web-based platform and its extension to
cover the entire central government, including modules on treasury and human resources,
resulting in the establishment of a single treasury account and automated payroll for civil
servants. The PRS TAC project enabled the Bank to stay engaged in the reform dialogue across
many sectors including: (i) the decentralization of the water sector (ii) the launching of
monitoring and evaluation programs and (iii) the audit of teacher posts allocation, which initiated
a debate on reform needs in the education sector.9 The consolidation of the Tribunal Superior de
Cuentas established the institution as an independent entity and contributed significantly to
audit-based monitoring of public resources. The project, however, fell short in delivering much
in efforts to professionalize the civil service – an important project goal and persistent
impediment to development. Additionally the Bank delivered “quick gains” procurement
recommendations to the government in 2009 and 2011. As a result of these recommendations,
the government transferred the responsibilities of the procurement agency ONCAE from
Presidencia to the Ministry of Finance.
118. Honduras was one of the Governance and Anti-Corruption Country (C-GAC)
pilots, and benefited from additional resources to support governance reforms. With these
resources, the Bank supported the Government’s efforts in the following areas: (i)
implementation of the access to information law; (ii) strengthening check and balance
institutions to enhance accountability of the Executive and providing support to the Legislature
to conduct its oversight role; (iii) supporting efforts to make performance information available
to the public and focus the policy discussion on performance in the sectors where the Bank is
engaged; (iv) supporting social monitoring activities and strengthening the voice of stakeholders
representing public interest in the sectors where the Bank is engaged, and (v) sector level
governance initiatives linked to projects. Several grants supported these initiatives including the
9

It is also worth mentioning, that the passing of the Transparency Law and the establishment of the Institute of
Access to Public Information – supported by PRS TAC –substantially advanced the transparency and accountability
agenda of the country, an example being that the law enabled Congress to use the Public Audience mechanism to
select Supreme Court justices.
38

Governance Strategy Note, Institutional Governance Review, Expenditure Tracking Survey, and
an Enhancing Transparency and Accountability IDF grant. The IDF grant was instrumental in its
support launching and financing the Access to Public Information Institute, an invaluable and
underfunded tool for civil society. These instruments provided a menu of options for engaging
and supporting civil society.
119. The Institutional Governance Review, completed in 2009, identified key areas and
policy prescriptions for Honduras to improve the state of governance. The key challenges
identified are (i) the lack of transparency around decision-making; (ii) the lack of available
information to assess performance (which makes it difficult for citizens to hold policymakers
accountable); and (iii) the weak organizational capacity of groups representing public interest
that create conditions conducive to state capture and severely undermine socio-economic and
democratic development in the country.
120. Judicial services improved and the Bank Judicial Reform program increased access
of justice to the poor, minority groups and women. The project helped to modernize
courthouses, giving access to the urban and rural poor, and provided for mobile tribunals in
urban settings and the transition to oral proceedings for criminal cases – both successful
achievements in a country that suffers from impunity and a low trust of the legal system. This
model is an important mechanism to increase the credibility of democracy and rule of law
amongst citizens.
121. However, crime and violence undermined good governance and the rule of law.
Overall trust in criminal justice institutions and the police have declined significantly in recent
years, from 51% in 2004 to 41% in 2008, and from 57% in 2004 to 44% in 2008, respectively.
The Bank already has an entry point into the area of crime and violence prevention in Honduras,
through the existing Barrio Ciudad slum upgrading project, which showed promising results in
its integrated approach to urban upgrading and social prevention interventions. Possibilities to
deepen this engagement include scaling the project up geographically or building upon it to
develop a broader community security program that incorporates criminal justice reform,
situational prevention and a wider set of social interventions. Crime and violence prevention
could also be mainstreamed into projects from other sectors including transport, social
protection, education and public sector reform. The Bank’s regional study on Crime and
Violence in Central America, published in 2011, provides a guideline for further donor support
in combating crime and violence in the region.
CAS Pillar Three: Environmental Protection and Risk Management
122. The Bang Group delivered uneven results in its efforts to improve disaster risk
management and manage environmental resources.
While Natural Disaster Risk
Management (DRM) schemes achieved significant results at a national and municipal planning
level, challenging institutional arrangements, and in the case of the Corazón project, an
international disagreement with Nicaragua, limited the effectiveness of environmental
management projects.
123. The Bank helped Honduras build national capacity for disaster risk management
and reduce vulnerability in 81 targeted municipalities. The Natural Disaster Mitigation
39

Project was especially well received for its participatory processes and community and municipal
planning approach in one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. This project also
generated 59 community-based public works, designed to provide poor communities with
mitigation from natural disaster and generated a large quantity of local jobs. It was
complemented by and IDB loan scaling up the program, the Central American Probabilistic Risk
Assessment (CAPRA) risk modeling TA and a larger portfolio of regional DRM TA.
124. The PATH Land Administration (Phase II APL)10 and Forests and Rural
Productivity Project made modest progress in demarcating protected areas and benefiting
families through sustainable natural resources management programs. Of the ten protected
areas intended to be demarcated, two were demarcated and a further six delimited. The Forests
and Rural Productivity project failed to address important policy issues and the underlying
institutional deficiencies with the implementing agencies, ICF and SERNA. The Corazón GEF
grant, designed to coordinate protection of the Corazón biosphere together with the Nicaraguan
government, suffered significant setbacks, largely because of the political crisis and
unwillingness of the Nicaraguan government to work with their Honduran counterparts. The
Honduran Fund for Protected Areas was established, though it has not yet been capitalized.
125. Honduras piloted two of the Bank’s first carbon finance operations, which were
challenging to supervise and provide lessons regarding the economic viability and
operational issues working with this instrument. The Pico Bonito Forest Restoration
BioCarbon project was ultimately cancelled because of safeguard issues. La Esperanza
Hydroelectric Project, a 12.7 MW rural mini-hydroelectric dam and one of the WBG’s first
Carbon Finance operations, was constructed in 2005 and continues to profit from sales of
certified emissions reductions. Supervision responsibilities between the CMU and the Carbon
Finance Unit needed to be better defined.
CAS Pillar Four: Development of Human Capital
126. The Human Development portfolio, which focused on social protection, health,
education and diversity initiatives, showed mixed results, with an emerging role for the
Bank in supporting the design of national social protection schemes. Institutional and
political challenges limited the effectiveness of education interventions and provide ongoing
challenges to efforts in this sector. Overarching issues with regards to access to reliable data and
monitoring of national human development statistics complicated the evaluation of Bank project
impact.
127. During this CPS period, the Bank played an important role in designing and
financing national social protection projects. 11 The GOH took steps to build a coherent social
protection strategy and launched a conditional cash transfer program, Bono 10,000. This
program targets the poorest communities in Honduras and aims to increase school enrollment
and maternal health check-ups as conditions for the disbursements. The World Bank supported
this project through a $43 million Social Protection Project which helps the government reach

PATH ICR, October 18, 2010.
Despite a multitude of small social programs and the creation of the Ministry for Social Development under the
Zelaya administration, effective social safety net programs to protect the poor and to help mitigate the impact of
shocks were largely absent.

the poor by using well-targeted, decentralized schemes. In addition, during the 2008 food price
crisis, the Bank delivered a Development Policy Credit in support of the government’s
emergency food acquisition. The ongoing Nutrition and Social Protection project, which was
supported with Additional Financing in May 2011, supports the government’s Mi Primer Empleo
initiative, giving more than 4,800 young Hondurans access to job training (nearly 60% of the
project goal).
128. Projects in the HD sectors made progress toward their development goals; however,
tracking their impact was complicated by the lack of adequate data collection systems. The
Community Education Project contributed to the Government meeting most of its primary
education targets. A follow-up to the Health project, which closed in 2010, was prepared by the
Bank but was ultimately financed by the IDB because of limited IDA resources. Many
government agencies lack adequate data collection systems (particularly in Health and
Nutrition), while some projects were overly complex or diffuse in design to effectively supervise
(such as Nuestras Raíces).12 The current education project has a TA component that is
supporting the Ministry of Education in its collection and tracking of data. Future education
projects need to be carefully considered given that the situation with the government’s impasse
with teachers unions constrains significant policy changes. In that context, targeted AAA may
have a more meaningful impact than investment lending. Issues in the health sector remain, but
given the need the need for selectivity and the IDB’s lead in the sector, it is unlikely to become a
priority for limited IDA resources.
Bank Performance and Rating
Program Design
129. The FY07-FY10 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Honduras was discussed by
the Board on November 30, 2006 and was aligned with the broad framework of the PRS
prepared during the Maduro administration and priorities identified by the administration
of President Manuel Zelaya. The CAS identified four strategic pillars upon which to focus the
new country engagement: (i) Equitable Economic Growth for Employment Generation, (ii) Good
Governance through State Modernization and Civic Participation, (iii) Environmental Protection
and Risk Management, and (iv) Development of Human Capital.13
130. The CAS Progress Report, May 2008, delivered a positive message on growth and
advances towards meeting its development objectives. The Progress Report amended the
program by ending a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits originally envisioned in the
CAS, citing the challenges of doing so in the buildup to a presidential election. It still committed
to executing a Development Policy Credit in 2009 to address important structural changes
(which ultimately were only pursued with the 2011 DPC). The Progress Report warned of
rising food and oil prices and the risks that they would pose for the country and therefore
provided for an emergency food price operation addressing agricultural technology and scaled up

safety nets (which was delivered and fully disbursed). The timing of its preparation did not
allow it to foresee and address the political situation that came to be the dominant issue
impacting this CAS period.
131. As a response to the Honduran political and financial crisis of 2009, the Bank Group
delivered an Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which was discussed by the Board along with an
approximately $75m Development Policy Credit on November 9, 2010. The ISN was based
upon President Porfirio Lobo’s National Plan 2010-2022, which laid out 11 strategic pillars,
including economic growth, employment generation, and expanded access to education and
healthcare. The ISN enabled the Bank to convert the remaining IDA 15 allocation into an
important fiscal tool to help the Lobo Administration gain fiscal control of national finances and
provide the government time to develop a comprehensive development plan in preparation for a
new CPS. The 2011 DPC was well designed to help achieve several CAS results in Public
Financial Management and Energy.
Program Implementation
Operational Performance
132. The Pause provided the country team the opportunity to address implementation
challenges; however, disbursement ratios have not yet recovered to pre-pause levels.
Although the number of projects remained essentially the same over the past six years, the
number of projects with more than one risk flag significantly diminished in 2010, as the pause
provided the country team a chance to take a close look at the portfolio and address
implementation issues. However, the disbursement ratio of the portfolio fell dramatically from
36.7% at the end of FY 2006 to just 16.1% in FY2009 (just before the pause in operations) to a
mere 12% in FY10. This could be explained by having a younger portfolio in place as the older
projects closed. The Lobo administration’s government of reconciliation struggled to agree upon
development priorities, which has led to delays in making operational decisions such as the
restructuring of projects and in defining emerging priority areas of engagement.
133. Complicated project design made implementation costly and diminished
development impact. Several projects lacked clear definition of all components at appraisal,
including technical assistance. Unnecessarily complicated implementation arrangements
similarly led to delays and slow disbursements, as demonstrated in Social Protection and
Community Education projects. 14 The country team failed to foresee risks that ultimately
materialized in approving projects with multiple, disperse sub-projects with unrealistic oversight
arrangements (such as Nuestras Raíces)15. Furthermore, overly ambitious procurement plans and
lacking capacity in a number of projects (e.g. Roads, PROMEF) significantly delayed
implementation. Institutional strengthening components must be incorporated into all “brick and

14

When designing the implementation arrangements, projects should consider the need for outside technical
assistance during the implementation stages to help develop managerial capacity within the implementing entities,
especially in the early stages of the project when the development of bidding documents take place. This technical
assistance should be foreseen and included at appraisal, and institutional strengthening should be designed in all
works projects.

134. The IFC and MIGA increased their portfolio in Honduras to support economic
growth. After relative inactivity during the previous decade, IFC invested $38 million in FY08,
$163 million in FY09, $100.9 million in FY10 and $177.1 million as of February 2011. The bulk
of IFC activity over the past two years has been in financial markets, telecom, and agribusiness.
MIGA supported just one project during the CAS period, a $6.2m risk guarantee approved by the
MIGA Board on November 23, 2010 to ProCredit Holding (PCH) of Germany. The investment
supports PCH’s 21 banks in providing SME finance to clients in Honduras.
135. The Bank delivered high quality, relevant ESW, especially focused on governance;
however, the bulk of this work was delayed, postponed or poorly disseminated.
Unfortunately, given the timing of their completion, the IGR and the PETS were only partially
disclosed in November 2010 and were poorly disseminated. A public expenditure review was
performed in 2008, but a 2010 follow up never took place. The expected Country Economic
Memorandum has likewise been postponed as priority was assigned to preparing the emergency
DPC. However, a procurement study focusing on the pharmaceutical industry was well received.
As shown in Annex 3, the majority of AAA planned were delivered. This builds upon a larger
challenge that the Bank needs to do a better job demonstrating and disseminating the results of
its portfolio.
Bank Group Responsiveness
136. The Bank was attentive to the evolving political economy, levels of government
transparency, and transition following the pause. The food crisis hit Honduras in 2008,
prompting the Bank to deliver an emergency credit not envisioned in the original CAS. After
heavy rains in October 2008, the Bank approved an emergency roads credit, which materialized
in the form of $25m additional financing to the Second Roads Rehabilitation and Improvement
Project. The Bank lost confidence in the government’s commitment to using budget support for
genuine developmental purposes, leading to a focus on specific investment lending. The
Emergency Development Policy credit and support for the Bono 10,000 CCT were important
responses to needs expressed by the Lobo administration. The preparation of the ISN provided
the government time to prioritize in preparation for the new CPS, to focus on restarting the
paused portfolio and to deliver results.

43

137. Consistent with Operational Policy (OP) 7.30, the Bank, like most development
partners, paused operations in Honduras as it evaluated conditions on the ground. The
situation remained fluid for much of 2009 and the Bank began to resume disbursements in
December 2009, once it was clear that the conditions of OP 7.30 were fulfilled. During the
pause, the Bank took a number of steps to keep PIUs in place so that the projects would quickly
resume disbursements once the political crisis passed. The CMU unilaterally issued noobjections for the extension of PIU staff contracts which ensured that the staff would be paid.
Significantly, project legal agreements limited the ability of the government to dismiss PIUs
without specific justification based on their Terms of Reference and Bank no objection.
138. The Bank played an important role in a number of donor working groups, taking
leadership roles in certain instances, with bilateral agencies leading on more politicallyoriented topics. The Bank remains active in the local G16 donor group and is involved in many
sector-specific working groups. A number of Bank projects were coordinated with and
supported by other donors, including PRS TAC, COMRURAL, Roads and Social Protection.16
139. The Bank experimented with alternative project delivery mechanisms, several of
which proved successful. There are several success stories in municipal level execution,
including the Natural Disaster Mitigation, Municipal Water and Sanitation, the Community
Based Education Projects, and IFC infrastructure investments.
The implementation
arrangements in the Rural Infrastructure Project – one central PCU under the Social Fund (FHIS)
at the national level and technical units at the "mancomunidad" level – proved to be relatively
effective and efficient – after a long initial gestation/learning period – reducing transaction costs
and allowing communities to be involved in developing and executing an integrated vision for
the provision of the infrastructure services.
IV.

Rating

140. The WBG program is rated moderately unsatisfactory because although it made
partial progress in most of areas it experienced shortcomings deriving from project
implementation. The program achieved significant progress in meeting those goals in most
cases. This progress took place despite the pause and other crises described above. Notable
successes were registered improving the business climate, expanding judicial services, reducing
natural disaster risk, and expanding access to nutrition and basic education. Shortcomings were
found in professionalization of the public sector and establishment of rural alliances, and more
significant progress should have been made in roads and electricity where large percentages of
the portfolio remain undisbursed.
141. The Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory on account of the Bank
Group’s notable responsiveness to the evolving country events, deteriorating economic and
political conditions, and attention to protecting PIUs while at the same time providing
institutional strengthening to implementing agencies. The number of problem projects
decreased as more attention was placed on supervision of the portfolio. A strong dialogue was
maintained with each administration and although projects were delayed, all were brought on
track, enabling them to meet or make significant progress towards meeting their objectives. The
16

Partner donors included the IDB, BCIE, DFID, GTZ, SIDA, JICA and SDC (Switzerland).
44

IFC is to be recognized for its dramatically increased presence in country, which in many sectors
directly complemented the Bank’s lending program. In a country with such instability, the Bank
stayed focused on the development of key national sectors; though it also remained responsive
enough to help the government deal with the number of crises which emerged over the CAS
period. A shortcoming was the weak dissemination of analytical work which is partly explained
because of the political circumstances.
V.

Lessons Learned and Recommendations

142. In Honduras, implementation challenges experienced in the previous CAS period
provide lessons to be incorporated into the new CPS regarding project design, selectivity,
and development impact. The Bank must consider how to improve project design so that
projects are implemented more smoothly and better accomplish their goals. A larger challenge
to address is the seeming disconnect between projects largely meeting their objectives, but static
or even deteriorating conditions in the sector nationally. It should also consider a comprehensive
dissemination strategy, to communicate the results achieved by the portfolio and the lessons
learned for the sake of country-level development partners as well as the Bank Group as a whole.
The new portfolio will need to leverage a wide range of instruments to deal with the country’s
over-arching development challenges involving governance, citizen security and climate change.
Strategic Recommendations
143. Though important reforms were passed in the governance sector and projects met
their development objectives, many cross-cutting challenges persist, calling for a broader
framework on good governance. The Bank should work with the government to develop a
strategy that tackles Public Financial Management and Transparency, incorporates the findings
of the 2009 IGR (including the need to strengthen social accountability and the demand for good
governance), strategically leverages GAC allocations and builds upon envisioned Improving
Public Sector Performance project. The IGR provides other useful lessons that can be
mainstreamed into the entire Honduras portfolio.17
144. Address crime and violence by fighting youth unemployment and strengthening
institutions. With San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa among the ten most violent cities in the
world in 2010, citizen security will be the Honduran Government’s most pressing challenge
during the next CPS period. The Bank needs to consider how its portfolio, even those projects
that do not directly address justice issues, can play a role in reducing crime and violence.
Projects need to address youth unemployment and ensure that students are incentivized to stay in
school rather than join gangs. This is particularly true given slow economic growth, imploring a
need for job creation and economic opportunities for young Hondurans. Strengthening weak
institutions will help the government to deal with impunity and ensure provision of better
services for citizens. Projects that address the quality of education and its ability to prepare
graduates for the workforce, and slum upgrading are all areas of engagement that the Bank has
experience implementing and can be scaled up.

17

Including an analysis of municipal accounting mechanisms.
45

145. Mainstreaming Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management in new SD projects,
including infrastructure, water and sanitation, agriculture and urban operations. Given
Honduras’ vulnerability to climate change and extreme weather phenomena, which have already
led the government to request emergency financing in the road sector and forced repairs of Bankfinanced works, preparing for climate change should be mainstreamed. Through the Bank DRM
engagement in-country, particularly with the CAPRA model, there is a means for this analysis to
be included in project design.
146. In an era of increased selectivity, the Bank portfolio should build upon the seeds
sewn in sectors where it has extensive experience and work to scale those initiatives up
using a range of instruments and influence. It is important for the Bank to evaluate and take
strategic actions to rationalize the existing portfolio, considering both the issues of portfolio
performance, evolving country needs and potential for impact. Though there is room for
engagement in a number of sectors, the Bank should focus on those sectors where conditions are
appropriate for sustainable, scalable impact. A portfolio of small, disperse operations, though
less risky, limits the impact of each individual project and is ultimately more expensive to
supervise. There are examples of sectors where the Bank has been engaged for many years in
Honduras, including Public Sector Modernization, Land Administration, Water and Sanitation,
the Financial Sector and Slum Upgrading. The portfolio should build upon this experience,
continue to support AAA where relevant, and encourage the government and other donors to
scale up initiatives with successful track records.
Operational Lessons
147. Projects should be sufficiently defined and focused at appraisal in order to avoid
implementation delays. Project indicators should be sufficiently narrow to be useful tools and
keep implementing agencies on track towards meeting PDOs. While multi-sector engagements
may take longer to launch and begin disbursing, if sufficiently simple and defined, they have
demonstrated that they can be effective models. Minimum conditions for multi-sector projects
should be i) client demand, ii) a history of inter-institutional cooperation and iii) sufficiently
simple project design.
While implementing arrangements should seek to strengthen
government’s institutional capacity, the separation of fiduciary management and technical
responsibilities in two different agencies proved to be an inefficient implementation arrangement
which often eroded ownership. Projects should be subject to close monitoring when early signs
of weak performance are detected and targets should be established so that if not met within an
agreed timeframe, project development objectives are adjusted to avoid extensions.
148. The implementation and developmental successes working directly with
municipalities can help bypass some of the difficulties encountered at the national level.
Municipal governments are known to have stronger citizen accountability; and while they often
lack strong capacity, they provide a level of institutional continuity as many mayors are reelected
and institutional experience retained. There is certainly a strong developmental prerogative to
strengthening municipal governance; however, it is worth reflecting on the realities that private
companies are only willing to bid on sufficiently sizable projects. This is an area for the Bank
Group to explore further as it develops its new engagement with the government. The 2009 IGR
lays out specific recommendations for building confidence in municipal institutions, developing
municipal institutional capacity, and incentivizing good municipal reporting and transparency.
46

149. Capacity challenges in the civil service diminish development impact, though a
results-based framework can help to mitigate implementation risks. Projects across all
sectors struggled with implementation capacity constraints due to the endemic phenomenon of
civil service and project management turnover which accompanies each new administration. For
this reason, institutional strengthening has to be appropriately simple and targeted to have
focused impact. Regular portfolio reviews with government is an essential tool to keep
counterparts engaged in this process and should be continued. The 2009 IGR underscored that a
results-focused portfolio can mitigate weak institutional capacity by focusing on specific
deliverables; however, results should be sufficiently narrow and realistic.

In 2010 and 2011 there have been advances in compliance with publication of de oficio information on web
portals, although there remains much to be done (in terms of quality, display and availability of information) in
order to reach expected results. Municipal Governments are in a weaker situation, and are more slowly complying
with the Law, as well as several Congresspersons (many of who are not delivering de oficio information, even when
it is formally requested).

Bank Program

Strategic Objective 1: Improving Citizen Security
Government Strategic Priority: Reduce the levels of criminality in Honduras to below international averages, adopt an integrated approach to
citizen security through policies aimed at preventing crime and violence, by strengthening the justice sector and ensuring the protection of human
rights.
Results Area 1.1: Strengthened National Capacity to Address Citizen Security
The Government lacks a
comprehensive and integrated
approach to citizen security that
combines crime control with
violence prevention and
coordinates the actions of key
ministries, levels of government,
and non-state actors. The
presence of organized crime and
openness of the financial system,
combined with weak anti-money
laundering supervision capacity
of financial institutions leaves
Honduras vulnerable to money
laundering.

Throughout Honduras, people’s
perceptions of insecurity are very
high. Neglected poor urban
neighborhoods have higher
levels of crime and violence,
further marginalized by weak
infrastructure connections and
lacking community organization.
In most cases, municipalities
need to take a lead role in
promoting activities necessary
for a safer environment but have
weak planning and
implementation capacity.

Outcome 2. Strengthened capacity of
communities and local governments
in social prevention of crime and
violence

rates for youth in urban areas is
currently estimated at 9.6
percent, with another 8 percent

rampant, with youth being both
perpetrators and victims. Given
the link between unemployment
and crime, as well other risky
behaviors, the country has placed
particular importance on

ANNEX 3 IFC Program
150. IFC has developed a very active engagement in Honduras. After relative inactivity
over the past decade, IFC committed investments for US$38 million in FY08, US$163 million in
FY09, US$100.9 million in FY10 and US$250.1 million in FY11. The latter amount includes
US$32 million in equity investments committed through the IFC Capitalization Fund. The
Corporation’s outstanding investments in Honduras totaled US$192.4 million as of June 30,
2011. In addition, there is an undisbursed balance outstanding of $57.7 million, bringing IFC’s
committed balance to US$250.1 million at the end of June 2011. The bulk of IFC activity over
the past two years has been in financial markets, telecoms, and agribusiness. Loans accounted
for US$134.5 million of FY11 commitments, whereas trade finance and risk guarantees
accounted for US$81.6 and equity US$34million respectively.
i.

In financial markets, IFC is supporting banks with trade finance facilities and special
purpose facilities to reach SMEs, housing finance, sustainable energy finance as well as
supporting SMEs through microfinance institutions. IFC has also been selectively looking for
equity opportunities to further capitalize local financial institutions. IFC relationships with
Honduran financial institutions are key to executing the Corporation’s strategic objective of
poverty reduction through their MSME, microfinance, and housing financing lines. The
Corporation has trade finance lines totaling US$75 million to four Honduran banks. Two of
these Banks Ficohsa and Atlantida are the most active in trade within the region. IFC has
invested US$32 million in Banco FICOHSA common stock through the IFC Capitalization
Fund (ICF). The transaction also entails a US$38 million subordinated loan through the IFC
Subordinated Debt Fund (SDF), to be committed in early FY12. IFC has also SME and
Housing finance loans with Ficohsa that have been complemented with advisory service
support in SME finance, housing, and corporate governance.

ii.

IFC is pursuing more opportunities in microfinance. The Corporation holds $1.9 million in
equity in Banco Popular, the country’s first and only microfinance entity to become a
licensed bank. In addition to its direct investment, IFC has supported Banco Popular with
advisory projects aimed at improving risk management and efficiency, and capacity building.
More recently IFC Advisory Services engaged with ODEF, a leading microfinance institution
targeting women and with a strong focus on rural and peri-urban micro entrepreneurs. The
advisory projects focus on risk management and strategic planning. IFC is also evaluating a
long term funding facility for ODEF.

iii.

Agribusiness clients currently accounts for about 12% of IFC’s total loan portfolio, for a
total $21.6 million. Investments in this sector have enabled the Corporation to advance its
poverty reduction strategy. The key partnership in this sector is with food processing concern
Dinant. This company, which focuses on the low- and middle-income consumer market,
provides jobs to 4,500 workers, one-third of whom are women. IFC has also made long-term
loans to La Grecia, part of Central America’s leading sugar conglomerate.

77

iv.

The Corporation has also been active in the retail and telecommunications industries, with
loans totaling $45 million to retail developer Grupo Roble and a $70 million loan to Digicel,
a cellphone provider focused on poor communities in low-income countries.

v.

IFC has also begun working with subnationals and infrastructure sectors. IFC
approved in early FY11 a US$15.9 million risk-sharing facility with local banks to finance
Tegucigalpa’s 2010-11 $44 million investment program in road infrastructure. If successful,
this program could be rolled out to reach other municipalities. IFC is also financing the
largest privately owned hydroelectric plant in Honduras (La Vegona), a 38.5 MW run-of-theriver project, expected to sell electricity to industrial clients as well as the state-owned utility
ENEE under long-term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”). Improved infrastructure is
critical to strengthening regional trade links. IFC is also evaluating a potential intervention in
water and waste water management sector with the private concessionary in the city of San
Pedro Sula.

vi.

Honduras was selected as one of six pilot countries to participate in the Climate
Investment Funds’ Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries
(SREP). The private sector-oriented Fund will give the country access to up to US$30
million in potential co-financing for projects to support energy efficiency, renewable energy,
and access to cleaner production technology.

151. The Corporation also has a successful Investment Climate program underway in
Honduras. The program favors MSMEs which opted to remain in the informal sector due to
complex and expensive business registration processes. The Investment Climate program was
launched as a pilot in 2005 in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula to help both cities simplify
issuance of municipal operating licenses. As a result, the average number of days needed to
obtain an operating license fell to one day from 35 days for most businesses. IFC then expanded
the program to cover issuance of operating licenses and construction permits in seven other cities
(Puerto Cortes, El Progreso, La Ceiba, Roatan, Copan Ruinas, Danli and Choloma). Tegucigalpa
and San Pedro Sula are also participating in this phase of project, to simplify procedures to issue
construction permits. This second stage of the program is expected to be concluded by June
2011. An estimated 16,000 SMEs will have benefited from the program, generating cost savings
of about $ 1.3 million. The municipal licensing simplification program was undertaken in
conjunction with the Bank’s Trade Facilitation Project.
152. The IFC and FPD are supporting trade and logistics in the rural and regional
contexts. At the end of April 2011, IFC Investment Climate Advisory Services and the FPD
Investment Climate Practice started the implementation of the Agribusiness Trade Logistics
Project which will implement short and medium term improvements in exports and import
procedures and is expected to improve the Doing Business Trading Across Borders indicators
and generate cost savings. In the medium term, it is expected to become a Central American
regional program. Furthermore, a Bank-IFC team is starting to develop a project that aims at
fostering competition in the markets of key agriculture inputs by removing entry barriers and
discretionary application of regulations in the fertilizers and pesticides markets. This project is
expected to contribute to the competitiveness of the agribusiness sector through lower input
prices and greater quality and variety of inputs.

ANNEX 4 Gender Issues
I.

Overview

153. This Annex presents an analysis of key gender issues and resources in Honduras to
provide initial guidance on gender integration in World Bank strategy areas in the country.
154. Gender refers to “the social, behavioral, and cultural attributes, expectations, and norms
associated with being a woman or a man. Gender equality refers to how these aspects determine
how women and men relate to each other and to the resulting differences in power between
them” (cited from: Upcoming WDR on Gender and Development). The integration of gender
considerations into World Bank engagement involves an understanding of the relationship
between men and women in society, in terms of the roles they play, the relationships of power
between them, their differential access to resources and their specific and often differential
development outcomes. Thus, understanding gender roles and relations can draw out key factors
that can improve Bank operations by (i) anticipating the impact of gender dynamics on the
effectiveness of operations and (ii) anticipating the impact of operations on the relative status and
well-being of men and women.
155. In recent decades the government of Honduras has taken decisive steps to strengthen the
legal and institutional framework aiming to protect and promote women’s rights and gender
equality. However, laws do not automatically translate into reality and thus, gender gaps in
several dimensions of development remain and persist.
156. In education, levels for women and girls have increased to the point that, on average,
women now have more schooling than men which results in an inverse gender gap in education.
However, girls’ successes in education do not translate into the labor market where men still
clearly predominate. Women's labor force participation has increased only slowly over the last
two decades and, with 40.1 percent in 2009, it continues to be one of the lowest in Latin
America. Also, the unexplained gender wage gap remains large when compared to other
countries in the region.
157. In terms of health, although the indicators for sexual and reproductive health have
improved over the last two decades, Honduras lags behind if compared to the region – the
maternal mortality ratio is still notably high, and similarly only 66.9 percent of the childbirths are
attended by skilled health staff on average with alarmingly low coverage for the poorest quintile
of the population.
158. Quantitative and qualitative information indicates that violence among young adult males
and male violence against women continues to be high. Men are the primary victims of
homicides, whereas both men’s and women’s homicide rates have increased lately and have
reached a level of serious concern.
159. With regards to gender and youths, males are more likely to drop out of school, and
engage in violent behavior. Both female and male youth’s risky behavior contributes to
Honduras’ major development challenges. Adolescent fertility rates are very high, especially
among poor women. Among boys, dropping out of school and the lack of employment
79

opportunities is linked to their involvement in gangs and acts of violence as well as in crime and
drug trafficking.
Legal and Institutional Framework24

II.

160. Honduras has ratified the CEDAW Convention,25 and in 1995, Honduras signed the
Action Platform approved at the Women’s World Conference in Beijing and ratified the InterAmerican Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against
Women, promoted by the Organization of American States (OAS).
161. The Constitution of Honduras prohibits all forms of discrimination and federal
legislation makes clear reference to equality for men and women. Honduras’ Family Code
upholds equality between the spouses in every aspect of everyday life, sharing equal rights to
parental authority. However, although both spouses are legally responsible for family matters,
socio-economic traditions recognize men as the heads of households.
162. Honduran legislation supports financial independence for women, but also here the law
does not yet translate into daily life. Concerning access to land, Article 74 of the Law on Equal
Opportunities for Women stipulates that women and men are equally entitled to benefit from the
Land Reform Law, yet women own only one-quarter of all plots in the country. There is no legal
discrimination against Honduran women in the area of inheritance. The law favors the surviving
spouse regardless of gender, provided the inheritance is necessary for their subsistence.
163. The government of Honduras has taken steps to strengthen protection of women’s
physical integrity, but violence against women remains a common problem (see also the
paragraph on Violence in this document). In 1994, the government established a judiciary
department specializing in violence against women. Family violence and rape were criminalized
in 1997, and the definition of violence was broadened to encompass psychological and economic
violence. The number of complaints resulting in convictions has increased in recent years, but
remains relatively low due to institutional weakness. Rape is criminalized under Honduran law
and considered a “public crime” and proceedings can be initiated even if the victim does not
press charges.
164. In recent years, particular pieces of legislation were passed or amended in order to
promote women’s empowerment and gender equality - three key laws should be mentioned
here: the Law against Domestic Violence (as explained above, 1997), the Law of the National
Women’s Institute (1999), and the Law for Equality of Opportunities for Women (2000).
165.

On an institutional side, the government has introduced
the Special Public Prosecutor’s Office for Women, in 1994;
special courts on domestic violence in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, in 2007;
the National Women’s Institute (Instituto Nacional de la Mujer, INAM), as the national
machinery for the advancement of women, in 1999.

166. INAM has an advisory role to other Ministries, and is responsible for providing technical
assistance in gender integration and acting as official coordinator for women’s issues. INAM
cites the following list of responsibilities:







educating Ministries about gender as a technical issue;
coordinating gender training and research;
incorporating a focus on women’s issues and gender equity in the decentralization
process;
institutionalizing the practice of gender mainstreaming into all government bodies;
articulating sector-specific gender issues;
acting as government liaison with the women’s movement; and
managing donor-funded projects to promote gender equity.

167. In November 2002, the Política Nacional de la Mujer was declared by President
Maduro to be a part of the official state policy. INAM is charged with providing assistance in
this task. The policy targets five specific areas of concentration: Health, Education and
Communication, Economy and Poverty, Violence, and Social Participation and Politics (USAID
Gender Assessment Honduras 2002)26.
168. Honduras’ government has established several laws and programs to protect and promote
women’s rights and gender equality so as to ensure that relevant constitutional commitments are
reflected in national legislation. However, despite the legal initiatives taken by the country in
recent years, the reality of many women in the country is still far from the goal of equality
between men and women. Patriarchal beliefs continue to influence the ideology of public
institutions and political parties, and represent the main obstacle to improving conditions for
women in the country (OECD Social Institutions and Gender Index).
III.

Demography – Social Inequality

169. Life expectancy at birth is slightly higher for females than for males (74.86 and 70.06
years, respectively). As in other Latin American countries, Honduras’ fertility rate declined in
recent decades: from 5.14 (1990) to 3.19 (2009) – but is still above the Latin America/Caribbean
(LAC) average of 2.2 births per women (WDI).
170. A significant number of households are female-headed: 26 percent (WDI 2006). This
pattern seems to be driven by a combination of male migration, divorce and spousal
abandonment or death (Vakis 2011). However, contrary to what has been observed in many other
economies, in the case of Honduras, poverty rates among female-headed households are a full
ten percentage points below those of male-headed households (42.1 percent compared to 53.2
percent and 16.1 percent versus 25.9 percent in the case of extreme poverty), the gap can be
partially explained by the fact that female-headed households are more likely to be located in

26

According to a recent gender assessment by JICA, a lack of timely and appropriate funding for INAM has limited
its technical capacity. INAM’s weakness increased with the departure of the Swedish Cooperation Agency in 2010.
In recent years, INAM had apparently depended largely on Sweden’s financial and technical support.
81

urban areas, to have migrants abroad and receive remittances (World Bank Poverty Assessment
2006)27.
171. Remittances from Central American migrants have been an increasingly important
source of income for families in origin countries. In Honduras, remittances account for a
significant share of GDP – US$2.8 billion, or 20.1 percent of GDP (Vakis 2011, Sources: U.S.
Census Bureau Foreign Born Profiles; World Bank Migration and Remittances Factbook 2008).
Given migrant women’s labor force participation rates of over 50 percent, a considerable
proportion of these resources come from women (Vakis 2011).
172. According to the CEPAL Gender Observatory, the percentage of the total population
aged 15 and above with no incomes of their own and who are not studying, in relation to the
total female or male population (aged 15 or above), is remarkably higher for the female
population (both rural and urban):
Rural population:
Urban population:

female:
female:

48.9%
30.6%

male: 14.5%
male: 10.5%

173. Data (from: The World’s Women 2010) show that 17 percent of girls aged 15–19 are
living in consensual unions. The incidence of early marriage is also very high. Adolescent
fertility rates are amongst the highest in Latin America: 90.08 births per 1000 girls aged 15-19
in 2009 (WDI) – compared to 72.27 on average for LAC.
174. Gender intersects with other social variables as all men and all women do not face the
same circumstances and barriers. As observed in other Central American countries, there are
remarkable differences between rural and urban areas and between indigenous and nonindigenous populations in Honduras. Nine indigenous peoples are recognized by the state.
Together with afro-Hondurans, they represent 7.2 percent per cent of the total population (FAO
2008 – based on data from the 2001 census). The indigenous population in particular seems to
face generally more precarious living conditions, higher poverty rates and greater discrimination.
IV.

Education

175. Women in Central America have not only closed the education gap but in some cases are
ahead of men. In Honduras, there is gender parity in terms of primary schooling. But although
attendance and enrollment rates are very close at younger ages, there is a sharp drop among boys
with increasing age. Ensuring parity for boys at secondary and especially at tertiary level, has
become a serious challenge:
Ratio of female to male

primary enrollment
secondary enrollment
tertiary enrollment

99.78
123.94
151.48
Data from WDI (refers to 2008)

27

While about half of all Central American migrants in the U.S. are women, the gender composition varies by
country of origin, as does the migrant households’ composition. For example, women comprise over 50 percent of
migrants from Honduras and they are more likely to form their own households without husbands (Vakis, 2011).
82

176. Girls are not only more likely to attend school but also more likely to graduate, and this
pattern is consistent from pre-school through secondary school:
Persistence to grade 5:

female
male

80.34 %
75.49 %
Data from WDI (refers to 2007)

177. In 2007, there was no significant difference in literacy rate between men and women
could be noticed, which was 83.45 percent for women and 83.75 percent for men (WDI 2007).
When it comes to youths, literacy rates are slightly higher among girls (95.05 percent versus 92.7
percent for boys (WDI 2007)).
178. The repetition rate is generally considered to be an indicator of the quality of education.
In Honduras, 5.3 percent of all primary students on average had to repeat in 2008 (compared to,
for example, 0.77 percent in Bolivia, 3.6 percent in Mexico and 12.44 percent in Guatemala).
And, also here, boys are in disadvantage: the rate of male repeaters is higher (6.03 percent) than
that of female repeaters (4.53 percent) (WDI 2008).
179. School attendance does not necessarily reflect knowledge acquired - qualitative issues in
terms of education are highly significant28: The fact that girls are more successful in school than
boys, but less successful in the job market, can partly be understood as a reflection of the
inadequacies in the educational system itself. This implies that even students who stay in school
do not achieve skills that prepare them for the workplace. It is necessary to explore whether
vocational training programs prepare young women for sectors that show returns to their
education.
V.

Labor Markets

180. Between 1997 and 2006, female labor force participation (FLFP) in Latin America
increased, reaching an average of 56 percent in 2009. By contrast, FLFP rates are slightly lower
on average in Central America. Notably, women’s participation in the labor market in Honduras
is one of the lowest in Latin America with 40.1 percent in 2009 (WDI), compared to a male labor
force participation rate of 80.2 percent. In addition, FLFP in Honduras has grown less than in
most other Latin American countries over the last decade (WDI).
181. According to the World Bank Poverty Assessment 2006, female labor participation is
almost twice as high in urban areas than in rural areas: around half the urban working age
women take part in the labor market, compared to only about a quarter of rural working age
women.

28

The JICA Gender Assessment 2011 mentions efforts by the Secretary of Education to address the promotion of
gender equity in education through approaches to improve the quality of education such as safe school environment;
elimination of discrimination in the learning materials’ contents; incorporation of strategies to deal with gender
discrimination in the classroom and curriculum into teachers’ training; issues related to boys’ and girls’ retention
and school performance; and teacher and non-teaching staff gender balance.

in the labor force. However, and to some

extent unexpectedly, Honduras is a very
good performer in terms of childcare: More than 40 percent of young children in Honduras
attend some form of childcare service (including public and private centers as well as intrahousehold provision). This is the second highest rate in the region - in Guatemala for example,
less than 18 percent of children attend childcare (Vakis 2011).
is available under the following link:

184. Part-time work29 is increasing in many countries around the world, particularly for
women. The World’s Women 2010 report cites Honduras as an outstanding case where the share
of employed persons working part-time (less than 30 hours per week) is 35 percent for women
and 16 percent for men in 2007. These levels are high, especially if compared to countries
outside Europe.
185. Not only low participation rates, but also the quality of Honduran women’s
participation in the labor force is a concern. According to Atal, Ñopo and Winder (2009) the
gender wage gap in Honduras stands at about 5.6 percent and at 16.3 percent if controlling for
age and education (data from: Encuesta Permanente de Hogares de Propositos Multiples
(EPHPM) 2007), which places the country within the group of LAC-countries that register the
greatest unexplained wage gaps, whereas Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico register the lowest.
In fact, Honduran women face a wage gap that is not accounted for by observable characteristics
(such as education or age) or choice of career. However, Vakis (2011) shows that earnings gaps
between men and women have decreased dramatically and Honduras (together with El Salvador
and Guatemala) are among the best performers in Central America in reducing the wage gap in
over the last decade, with particularly poor women experiencing the largest gains in earnings
(Vakis 2011).
186. Wage gaps may suggest cultural or social factors - such as differential preferences
between men and women, the implications for labor supply and training, discrimination in the
market and societal expectations that limit women's access to labor markets (World Bank
Poverty Assessment 2006). Generally, it seems that gender stereotypes have a strong impact on
women’s economic opportunities. Besides discrimination by employers, one major factor might
be that formal and informal systems of education collaborate to reinforce gender
stereotypes, influencing girls and boys in making specific choices in terms of sectors and
occupations. Those choices often represent an extension of domestic tasks and of the
traditionally reproductive role of women (sewing, cooking, caring) thus being both, a reflection
29

Defined here as employment of less than 30 hours per week.
84

and a reinforcement of culturally defined roles. The sectors chosen by girls often represent lower
incomes and less perspective for professional career. This is also demonstrated by the following
table, showing the highly segregated share of male and female participants in training courses
provided by the National Institution for Professional Formation (Instituto Nacional de Formación
Profesional, INFOP) in 2007:

187. Self-employment and microenterprise employment are the most important sources of
remunerated work for poor women in most Central American countries. Close to 40 percent of
employed women in Honduras is self-employed (Vakis 2011); female self-employment levels
have increased in the last decade and are higher than male self-employment rates. The
percentage of female firm owners is highest among firms with less than 5 employees (about 50
percent) (World Bank 2009).
188. The Duncan index for sectoral occupational segregation for Honduras is very high
(almost 0.5, Source: SEDLAC, data for 2006). In Central America only Nicaragua accounts for
(slightly) higher sectoral segregation (Vakis 2011). Gender-specific (occupational) segregation
in the labor market in Honduras is also high: more than a third of all employed women in
Honduras are employed in commerce whereas half of the employed men are in primary activities
(see Figure A4.1).

189. Despite its relatively recent origins, labor-intensive goods have become a leading export
sector in every Central American country except Costa Rica and Panama (Vakis 2011). The
maquilas are a major provider of employment. In Honduras, approximately 70 percent of all
maquila workers are women (Vakis 2011 – cited from: De Hoyos et al. 2009; Quintana et al.
2002; Gutierrez et al. 2008).
190. Another quality-of-work related issue is related to the (in)formality of employment: In
Honduras, women are somewhat more likely to work in the informal sector than their male
counterparts (61.4 percent vs. 53.7 percent for male30 – source: SEDLAS, based on INE 2007).
191. Youth unemployment rates are not at a particular high level if compared to other
economies of the region (female: 11.24 percent, male: 5.24 percent (WDI 2005)). However,
Cunningham et al (2008) show that LAC countries that have relatively low youth unemployment
also have relatively higher inactivity rates, and those with high unemployment rates have lower
inactivity rates. This is also the case for Honduras: The unemployment rate is very low, but the
inactivity rate is quite high, leading to a jobless rate that is similar to those of other countries in
the region. When it comes to adult unemployment rates, no gender gap can be noted (2.93
percent of female labor force being unemployed versus 2.86 percent of the male one in 2007
(WDI).
192. In Honduras, as in most other countries worldwide, women face a double burden of
employment and domestic and care work: This is evidenced by the fact that the amount of

30

Definition: Informal=salaried workers in small firms, non-professional self-employed and zero-income workers.
86

time spent in unpaid work by women is more than double that of men on average: 3.5 hours per
day (female) versus 1.4 hours per day (male) in 2009 (CEPAL Gender Observatory).
VI.

Health

193. Gender-specific health indicators have been improving in Honduras over the last decade.
However, Honduras clearly lags behind in terms of sexual and reproductive health, when
compared to regional averages.
194. The Maternal mortality of 110 deaths per 100,000 live births (WDI 2008) is remarkably
higher than the regional rate of 85.12. In LAC, only Haiti, Bolivia and Ecuador have higher
maternal mortality ratios. Half of these deaths occur during childbirth and postpartum and,
according to JICA (Gender Assessment 2011), their causes are preventable: hemorrhage,
hypertension during pregnancy, and infections. However, maternal mortality was reduced from
210 per 100,000 live births in 1990. Most of the reduction happened between 1990 and 1997 and
is attributed to a combination of increased skilled attendance and improved referrals of obstetric
emergencies and high-risk women (Koblinsky 2003).
195. Closely related to the above is the fact that only 66.9 percent of the childbirths were
attended by skilled health staff in 2006--22 percentage points below the regional average.
There is a huge gap due to the place of residence of the woman, as 90 percent of births in urban
areas take place in a hospital compared to only 50 percent in rural areas (PAHO 2009). Wealthy
and poor populations also have clearly different access to skilled health staff: only 33 percent of
women in the lowest income quintile have access to skilled health staff compared to almost
complete access (99 percent) among the richest quintile (WHO Health Profile Honduras 2008).
The percentage of births at home also increases among woman over 35 years of age (42 percent-PAHO 2009).
196. Antenatal care coverage also is lower than regional average (95 percent in 2009): 91.7
percent of women in Honduras were attended by skilled health personnel at least once during
their pregnancy (WDI 2006). The same is true for contraceptive prevalence, which at only 65.0
percent (WDI 2006), is 10 percentage points lower than the average in LAC.
197. The adolescent fertility rate (girls ages 15–19) also is very high with 90.08 (births per
1000) in 2009 (WDI). Similarly, CEPAL Gender Observatory states that Honduras accounts for
the second highest rate in LAC, with 18.3 percent of girls aged 15-19 being mothers (in 2001).
Early childbearing is especially common among the poor. Data from the last available
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS 2005) show that 46.4 percent of women aged 20-24 who
had a child did so before they were 20 years old, and 26.1 percent before they were 18 years old.
These percentages increase in rural areas to 54.5 percent and 32.2 percent respectively.
Adolescent girls in the poorest income quintile are three times more likely to become mothers
than their richest counterparts (31 percent and 10 percent, respectively). Education seems to have
a huge impact on whether or not adolescent girls become mothers or not: 46 percent of girls that
are pregnant or mothers (age 15-19) have no education; 42 percent completed primary schooling;
11 percent have secondary schooling and only 2 percent are in tertiary education (DHS 2005).

87

198. With regards to HIV/AIDS, with 0.7 percent of the population estimated to be HIV
positive, Honduras has a concentrated HIV epidemic, with particular populations showing
significantly higher prevalence rates than the general population (USAID Health Profile
Honduras 2010). Specifically vulnerable populations include MSM (4.8 to 9.7 percent of whom
are HIV positive), female sex workers (among whom prevalence rates are as high as 5.5 percent),
and the ethnic minority Garifuna community (whose rate is 4.5 percent). The percentage of sex
workers who use condoms with clients is high (97 percent) in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and
La Ceiba. However, the same sex workers reported only 41 percent condom use with casual
partners and 11 percent with regular partners (USAID Health Profile Honduras 2010).
VII.

Violence

199. Violence seems to be increasing in Honduras and poses serious concerns to policy
makers and citizens. Young men in particular are involved in gang activities. High patterns of
violence are evidenced by particularly high (and increasing) homicide rates: homicides increased
18.5 percent from 2009 to 2010, for a total of 6,239 victims, which causes strong concern
(numbers based on Policia Preventiva/ Observatorio de la violencia, which are somewhat
different from UNODC).
200. Among the homicides committed in the first six months of 2010, when analyzed by age,
the most vulnerable group is between the ages of 15-44 years (80.1 percent of deaths), with an
even higher prevalence between the ages of 20 to 29 years (1,069 cases). Disaggregating the data
by sex, men account for 93.8 percent of homicide victims (5.854 cases). The homicide rate for
men is as high as 147.6 (per 100,000) in Honduras while the homicide rate for women is 9.4 (per
100,000). There was a 6 percent increase in female homicide in 2010 compared to 2009, with
385 lives lost. Women between 25 and 29 years of age are most at risk: the homicide rate for this
age group reaches 20.4 (per 100,000) (IUDPAS 2010).

202. As in most societies with high general levels of violence and crime, violence against
women is common and represents a widespread social problem in Honduras. Violence against
women is the cruelest form of expression of discrimination of women. A specific form of
gender-based violence is domestic violence (based on the UN definition including physical,
sexual, verbal, psychological violence), which is widespread in Honduras, and a major concerns
of women’s organizations (USAID Gender Assessment Honduras 2002).
203. The Encuesta Nacional de Epidemiología y Salud Familiar (ENESF 2006) found that 15
percent of interviewed women had suffered violence once in their lifetime. The rate increased
with age: From 9 percent amongst women 15-19 years old up to 21 percent for women 40-44
years old. Rates were slightly higher for women in urban areas compared to women living in
rural areas (17 percent and 12 percent respectively). The level of education also correlates
disproportionally with the probability of maltreatment: One in five women (20 percent) with no
education experienced violence at least once in their lifetime, whereas the share was significantly
lower for women with tertiary education levels (12 percent). With regards to violence by an
intimate partner, 15 percent of interviewed women reported having experienced some form of
violence within the last 12 months – 9 percent either physical or sexual violence. Amongst
divorced or separated women, the share of physical violence within the last 12 months reached
16 percent. According to the same study, 32 percent of women who reported suffering some type
of violence within the last 12 months sought help – most likely from their family or friends. Only
18 percent addressed the police and only 11 percent went to court31.
VIII. Decision-Making, Political Representation and Participation
204. Traditional gender roles in Honduras place women in a subordinate position relative to
men, focused on the domestic sphere and related care work. Even in intra-household decisionmaking on purchases for daily household needs, women do not always participate, specifically

31

While it is difficult to obtain good data on GBV in general and domestic violence in particular, underreporting is a
serious problem – everywhere. Increasing ´numbers´ of DV cases might actually be a positive sign – implying that
women feel empowered to take the risk to speak out against their partners.
89

women in the poorest quintile of which only 59 percent report to do so (compared to 91 percent
of women from the wealthiest quintile (The World’s Women 2010).
205. Similarly, involvement, participation in decision-making and representation in the public
sphere and specifically in political life remains very minimal. The government has responded to
this issue by introducing a 30 per cent minimum quota for women candidates for publicly
elected positions in article 105 of the Law on Elections and Political Organizations. However,
measures to enforce compliance with this quota seem to be lacking as criticized by the CEDAW
Committee in its Concluding Comments (CEDAW 2007).
206. Thus women continue to hold less than 30 per cent of positions in all categories of
elected office:

Legislative power (Proportion of seats held by women in national parliament): 18%

Local power (share of elected women town councilors of the municipal government):
17.5% (2009)
Data: CEPAL Gender Observatory

207. Interestingly, Honduras was an outstanding example as having a large presence of
women in the judiciary: 8 women had been appointed as judges of the Supreme Court, out of a
total of 15 until 2008 (CEPAL Gender Observatory). However, in 2009, only 20 percent of the
judges of Supreme Court were women (CEPAL Gender Observatory).

ANNEX 5 CPS Consultations
I.

Introduction

208. The current CPS was developed through a participative consultation process, which
included Government representatives and non-governmental actors. This Annex provides a
summary of the main results from the consultations with the latter (particularly civil society
sectors, local governments and members of the National Congress), which were carried out
during the period between June and October of 2011 (see Box 1 for a description of the process).

Box A5.1: Overview of the Consultation Process for the Honduras CPS FY 2012-2014
The consultation process for the development of the new CPS in Honduras began with: the drafting of a
CPS Concept Note, which was based on the current priorities as expressed by the Government; an
analysis of the national development strategy (in this case, the Country Vision and National Plan) and
how support from the World Bank fits in to said strategy; as well as an evaluation of the previous CPS
period and lessons learned. Once the Government provided its comments on the Concept Note, a series
of complementary consultations were conducted with other donor agencies in the country (for example,
IADB, CABEI, EU, USAID) in order to ensure greater complementarity of support aimed towards
enhanced aid effectiveness; as well as with other stakeholders (particularly civil society sectors, local
governments and members of Congress, the private sector), in order to take into account a diversity of
perspectives that might strengthen the vision, orientation, and implementation of the new CPS.
Between June and October of 2011, a total of 9 formal consultation sessions were held with
representatives of civil society, local governments and members of Congress; 3 of these consultations
were particularly focused on issues related to citizen security, crime and violence. Sessions were held in
Tegucigalpa, as well as in other regions of Honduras (particularly, the Western, North Coast and Valle de
Sula regions), with 15 -20 participants each. The participants represented NGOs working in social
accountability, human development, environment, peace/justice, rights-based groups, etc., community –
based organizations, indigenous and ethnic groups, women’s organizations, social platforms/networks,
academia, private sector, think-tanks, as well as municipal authorities from urban and rural settings, and
members of Congress. Conducting a series of smaller meetings, as compared to a reduced number of
large forum events, allowed for greater quality of discussion. The sessions were conducted in a semistructured manner, in which the Bank presented progress and lessons learned during the previous CPS
period, as well as highlights of the emerging CPS. Participants were asked to openly provide their input
regarding the priorities identified in the new CPS; the major development challenges in Honduras; the
role of the Bank and any other element that should be considered during the new program.
In addition to the formal consultation sessions, a series of semi-structured meetings and interviews were
held during field visits to several parts of the country with stakeholders, including a sample of
beneficiaries of projects financed by the Bank. Finally, two additional consultation sessions were held
with civil society and government representatives (separately) regarding lessons learned and future plans
for the implementation of the second phase of the World Bank’s Governance and Anti-corruption (GAC)
strategy; these results have also been taken into account for the new CPS.
IFC’s EVP and CEO visited Honduras on 9th - 11th of August, 2011. The main objective of the visit was
to experience first-hand interaction with clients, private sector leaders and main authorities including the
Major of Tegucigalpa and the President of Honduras Mr. Porfirio Lobo. This interaction was enriching
and served as part of the consultation process for IFC’s strategy which entails a strong component in
regional integration.

94

209. Participants commended the consultation process on the CPS, expressed
appreciation of being able to engage with senior levels of Country Management directly,
and underlined the importance of maintaining similar periodic dialogue sessions
throughout the implementation of the CPS. Participants expressed that the World Bank has
been among the most open of multilateral aid agencies in consulting their assistance strategies
with civil society in Honduras. At the same time, they affirmed their strong interest in providing
social monitoring and follow-up to the commitments established in the CPS; both as a partner in
development, as well as a demand-side force to ensure accountability and results. Some
participants also expressed that it would have been helpful to the discussion to have had access to
the Completion Report of the previous CPS (or CAS), and more specific information of the new
CPS (at least in draft form). Participants conveyed general agreement with the thematic priorities
identified within the three pillars of the CPS, providing the following input for the Bank is taken
into account.
II.

Participants’ Opinions Regarding the Current Context and Recommendations

210. Participants expressed strong concern over the feasibility and degree of
commitment among stakeholders (especially politicians) to long term national development
strategies for Honduras, highlighting the need for enhanced dialogue mechanisms at local,
regional (sub-national) and national levels. Civil society expressed concern over the
“discontinuance” of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP) modality on the part of Government,
as well as on the part of aid agencies in Honduras. At the same time, there is a generalized
perception that although there has been some degree of progress in development indicators,
results have not met expectations, and the PRSP has largely failed to meet its objectives.
211. There is concern regarding the perceived limited buy-in of the current Country
Vision / National Plan on the part of ministries and other authorities, as well as civil
society, local governments and aid agencies; this is compounded by weaknesses in
coordination of interventions and limited local ownership of new dialogue structures established
by the new Plan, due in part to the limited scope of dialogue in its creation. There is potential for
improvement in this regard, and interest among civil society, but participants have doubts as to
whether this initiative will really become functional before the end of the current administration,
and fear that the recently created Regional Development Councils will not have substantive
impact on public administration and that the public will lose interest; thus generating uncertainty
as to whether the new national development scheme will survive the programmed change in
Government administrations (general elections are programmed for November 2013), as has
been the experience with previous initiatives. The broader concern is that this would, in turn,
foment increased frustration and lack of public confidence in national development plans that
would seem to change with each administration. The current political/economic/social postcrisis context in Honduras requires that lessons learned during the previous period be taken into
account by all stakeholders involved, and that substantive dialogue between Government and
civil society be urgently strengthened around results in development. There is a demand for the
Bank’s help in this sense, at national and regional (sub-national) levels, in supporting dialogue in
development.
212. In virtually all consultations, participants highlighted the centrality of governance
to aid effectiveness and development, and emphasized the importance of increasing support
95

in this regard in order to obtain sustainable impacts in development. Frustration was
expressed on the slow progress towards strategic development goals (including those of the last
CAS), despite large sums of debt relief and development aid received by Honduras during the
last decade. Civil society participants attribute this to a poor governance framework, lack of
political will, and to the perceived inefficiency with which projects are managed from the
Central Government. Civil society thus emphasized the need for enhanced “conditionalities” in
governance and anti-corruption in Bank projects, suggesting that this would be one of the most
important ways in which to ensure change, as well as a way for donor agencies to openly signal
their commitment to good governance and avoid perceptions that they might be turning a “blind
eye” towards corruption in the country. Without such provisions, participants question
Government’s capacity or justification to take on increased debt for development, in light of the
unmet expectations in results up to now, as well as the persistence of structural problems.
213. Participants also expressed broad agreement with the overall findings of the Honduras
IGR (World Bank, 2009); namely, that: there is a lack of transparency in the policy-making
process and lack of information regarding performance; there is a lack of effective mechanisms
for the general public to reward or punish good or bad performance by elected officials, and have
this serve as political capital; that broader-based citizen-interest groups are relatively weak in
their advocacy efforts, as compared to groups organized around specific or focalized interests
(such as teachers’ unions and business groups); and that work on these issues would represent an
important step forward for governance conditions in the country. Finally, participants were
adamant that governance reform strategies must include a focus on coalition-building (including
political parties/movements, as well as civil society) to ensure greater impact and sustainability.
214. Top priorities identified by participants broadly for support in governance
strengthening and reform include:
(i) Strengthening results-based management systems, linked to SIAFI, with improved access
to quality and detailed information for public expenditure tracking on the part of the general
public.
(ii) Strengthening transparency of public procurement systems, particularly in health and
roads. CSOs affirmed that although there has been some progress in transparency in the
public sector, this has been meager compared to what was expected when the Transparency
Law was passed.
(iii) Support to Government for operation with open/transparent budgets (nationally and
locally). The Bank should increase support for citizen-led initiatives in monitoring of public
budgets and improved dialogue with Government on budgets centered on results. The Bank
should also support the strengthening of oversight and analytical capacities of the National
Congress in public budgets.
(iv) Continued support for the implementation of the Transparency Law. The Government
needs continued support in reaching optimal implementation of this Law, creating a culture
of transparency and accountability in public administration, and help to avoid politicization
and capture of the structures designed to uphold this Law.

96

(v) Support to the Justice system: The Bank should support projects that not only strengthen
aspects of modernization and increased access to services in the judicial system, but that
also strengthen the independence of the Judicial Branch, dealing directly with causes of
corruption and capture by specific interests.
(vi) Civil service reform, nation-wide: an issue that has long been a priority, and should be met
with concerted, definitive and very public action, reaching a cultural change in attitudes
towards civil service.
(vii) Tax reform (starting with an improved organization and administration), enhancing
potential for budget programming, avoiding what is perceived as improvisation in tax
policies; generating a national “fiscal pact” among political actors and civil society.
(viii) Support in further developing sector-wide strategies for improvement in Governance
and Anti-corruption (GAC); and strengthening the cross-cutting focus on GAC in the public
sector.
(ix) Continued support is still required for key governmental control institutions, such as the
TSC (Supreme Audit Institution) and the IAIP (Institute for Access to Public Information),
as well as their linkage to citizen-led monitoring initiatives.
(x) Building up a National Anti-corruption Policy and System. There is a demand for the
Bank’s technical support for stakeholders in this regard.
(xi) Finally, in a general sense, the Bank should to take into account an important concern
among CSOs: to be careful to avoid having its projects further contribute to the
concentration of political and economic power within the country.
215. Strengthening citizen security and the fight against crime and violence were
identified as top priorities in development. Participants conveyed that this has become a
primary issue in development for the country, as it seriously affects entrepreneurship and
economic growth. Drug-trafficking continues to be a prime concern in this respect, having
heavily permeated the economic activity of certain regions (for example, the North Coast
region). Particularly worrisome has been the perceived increasing influence of drug-related
activity and organized crime among authorities at various levels; as well as increasing violence
against women. The citizen security situation is linked to impunity; there is thus a broadly
sustained call (among civil society and Government agencies) for increased support for reforms
in the criminal justice sector, as well as for more effective mechanisms to purge security forces
of corrupt elements. Participants argue that the Bank should be strategic in using conditionality
to ensure that budget support operations clearly define criteria for the allocation of resources for
citizen security; however, the focus should be on prevention, rather than repression or control (in
contrast to the focus on citizen security in the past, which civil society participants affirm has not
worked) -- including scaling up the Barrio Ciudad model and broadening its focus on programs
for youth, women and children. The Bank should support analytical work on citizen security,
particularly the facilitation of the exchange of global experiences that have shown successful
results in reducing crime and violence. More importantly, however, dialogue among civil
society organizations, local governments, government agencies, and the international aid
97

community on thematic issues such as citizen security (e.g., round table on citizen security)
should be strengthened; in general, support for more effective coalition-building. Finally, there
is a clear need for continued support towards the creation of economic opportunities and social
services as a means to fight crime and violence.
216. A civil society think-tank noted that there is need to verify the trend in national
macro-economic indicators, due to changes in methodologies for measurement. The interest
is in keeping Government accurate and “honest,” and ensuring quality data be used in policy
formulation.
217. The need for economic growth was recognized, and its inclusion as “increasing
opportunities” within the CPS applauded; however, participants also manifested the need to
ensure that this growth would contribute to improving living conditions for a wider sector of the
population, and not contribute to a further concentration of economic and/or political power
among elites. One participant reminded the Bank not to exclude support for smaller-scale
initiatives, especially small-entrepreneurship that incorporates eco-friendly elements (ecotourism, for example) and that could ensure more sustainable and more broadly shared wealthproduction. Regarding Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), one participant mentioned that they
agreed that they can represent an important mechanism for financing reliable infrastructure in the
future, recognizing that the private sector has a role to play; underscoring, however, that the
Government is still ultimately responsible for infrastructure investments, particularly in rural
areas, as the market would not naturally capture this type of need.
218. In measuring progress towards strategic development goals, the Bank should focus
its efforts and support on achieving lasting, sustainable results in development, rather than
focus on individual project indicators and/or disbursement ratios. While project/program
reports may claim satisfactory results in implementation, there is a perception that improvements
in living conditions among the population are limited, and that more structural problems remain
as obstacles to development within the sector in question. On the part of civil society, there is a
call for the Bank to take a stronger role in advising the Government on how to utilize the
development cooperation it receives, rather than simply focusing how much money it can
commit and disburse; ensuring enhanced governance conditions might better justify the amount
of development aid (especially debt) received by Honduras.
219. Decentralization is considered as a means for making public administration more
efficient, responsive, accountable, and less vulnerable to capture by interests that operate
in a more centralized manner. Decentralization is a shared mid-term goal among stakeholders
(decentralization, towards the municipal level, of 40% of public investment is key indicator of
the Country Vision for 2038). Fears persist among some sectors at the same time, that
decentralization is a “stepping stone” towards privatization of public services; however, given
the broadly shared frustration of persistent inefficiencies in public administration, in recent years
the demand for increased and improved decentralization has only stronger, even in more difficult
thematic sectors (as an example: the recently approved Law on Incentives for Community
Participation in Education). Among participants in consultation sessions, the urgency of this
demand is understandably more notable among stakeholders from outside of the capital city;
among these regional stakeholders, the decentralized resources of the PRSP, for example, had the
greatest impact and were the most visible interventions of the PRSP among their communities.
98

In this sense, municipalities and mancomunidades (associations of municipalities) seek direct
support from the Bank, both in capacity strengthening as well as in decentralized aid, claiming
they are more efficient and accountable than the Central Government. Civil society shares this
sentiment, and insists that a focus on decentralization and local capacity-building (among local
governments and civil society) can also contribute to improved conditions for the sustainability
of projects. More concretely, participants suggest that the Bank should support the development
of pilot initiatives in decentralization in development with enhanced measures for good
governance.
220. Recognizing progress in this regard, participants expressed that the Bank should
further enhance its engagement with civil society, in four areas specifically:
(i) Increasing Bank support to civil society organizations working in social accountability
processes. The Bank should increase its direct support to local monitoring and social
accountability processes as part of each of its projects, but in an independent manner (not
necessarily tied to Government’s budget or procurement processes), linked to enhancing
performance of the Bank’s portfolio. The Bank could also help CSOs with technical
assistance to enhance the quality of their work on the demand side of good governance.
This kind of support could include creating new facilities or windows for financing and
technical support that might better accommodate the capacities of CSOs, while at the same
time foment dialogue and constructive engagement with Government. The Demand for
Good Governance window of the Bank’s Civil Society Fund is an interesting start.
(ii) Enhancing dialogue with civil society in Bank projects. Participants recognized that the
World Bank has been among the most open of multilateral aid agencies in consulting their
assistance strategies with civil society; however, the Bank should make sure to enhance
involvement of civil society in the discussions of development policy and reforms that the
Bank will support as part of the new CPS, particularly those linked to new DPCs. For
example, participants lamented that while state modernization has been a national priority
for over a decade, the results obtained up to now are relatively poor. There is concern that a
new loan focusing on improving public sector performance might not be as effective as
expected, especially if civil society is not involved. The Bank should help enhance
involvement of civil society in the strengthening of the “supply side” of good governance
(that is, in fomenting linkage and accountability in projects).
(iii) Fomenting coalition-building for reform. The Bank has an important role to play in
providing support and/or technical assistance to ensure more meaningful policy dialogue
between Government and civil society on issues of national and local development.
Participants recalled the limited local buy-in and ownership of the Country Vision and
National Plan, and underscored the importance of coalition-building for progress on the
governance-related themes previously mentioned. The Bank also has played a strategic role
among aid agencies in Honduras, and has the potential to strengthen coordination among
donors in the country.
(iv) The Bank should be more proactive in actions related to its recently approved Access to
Information policy, and more widely disseminate information on projects and analytical
work. The Bank should disseminate more timely information on progress in projects it
99

finances in the country, as well as its work in GAC, not only through its website, but also
through mainstream media and alternative means (especially social media); this would help
facilitate more effective social monitoring. This would allow for a greater potential in
coordination of efforts, and would make civil society actors aware of certain commitments
made by their Government, in order to hold them accountable for results. There is also
demand for high-quality analytical work to serve as a contribution for public debate around
key issues. Participants’ expressed concern that there may be valuable studies undertaken
by the World Bank that are not published or shared with civil society in a timely manner.
Participants also called on the Bank not only to publish these documents, but also to make
their core messages accessible (more readily understandable) for non-technical audiences. I
response, the Bank team committed to step up efforts at public dissemination through a
variety of for a and media to ensure that it these studies are accessible and can contribute as
needed to the national policy dialogue on development.
221. There is interest in having the Bank scale up social protection programs; however, it
is evident that information on such interventions and strategies must be more widely
disseminated for an enhanced public policy debate. There is much interest in programs such
as Bono 10,000 and employment generation; however, concern was expressed over the strategic
focus of such interventions, as well as inclusion and exclusion errors in Bono 10,000 (including
the decision to expand it to families of police officers); many participants still see it as a handout
with challenges regarding sustainability and targeting. This program could have greater impact
and sustainability if it were to incorporate improved local monitoring, dissemination of results,
and ensure complementarities with other actions/strategies in development, such as
improvements in quality and access to public health and education services, youth
entrepreneurship programs, among others. Similarly, participants made a call to strengthen
engagement with civil society sectors for the development of a Social Protection strategy.
222. Participants expressed concern that in the case of investments related to the rural
sector, the Bank might not be as effective as it could be. When considering rural
infrastructure, the Bank should take into account the need to foment rural dynamism and
synergies that might leverage economic opportunities in each respective region. Also, with
regard to the PATH and related projects, the Bank could further consider the specific challenges
of land-titling processes among communities with varied backgrounds or contexts (for example,
the challenges in common/communal titling, and differences among ethnic groups). Finally,
there is concern: specifically regarding the case of IFC’s support for bio-fuel production (in
northern Honduras), given the social conflicts that have surrounded these issues, and considering
the recent cancellation of other related international credits.
223. There is clear demand for support in producing and obtaining reliable data in
development: Support is needed for ensuring the achievement and access to reliable and timely
data at municipal and national levels; this is a challenge for policy-formulation and social
accountability.
224. Some participants were concerned that infrastructure, including water and
sanitation projects (but with the exception of roads), was not reflected as a priority in the
new CPS. This continues to be a prime issue in development for Honduras.

225. There is a need to strengthen the focus of the CPS not only on education coverage
among the population, but also on the quality of education delivered. Participants noted that
focus has been lacking on ethics, morals and spiritual development in education, and were
concerned that negligence of individual transformation and development of personal human
capacities is seriously limiting the collective potential of human development at community and
national scales.
226. Demand was expressed for support for the new Secretariat for Afro-Indigenous
Development in Honduras, as well as the Fund for Afro-Indigenous Development, to be
taken into account in within the context of future Bank loans, perhaps as a percentage of overall
development resources.
227. Environment, climate change and renewable energy: There is a need to support
environmental protection (particularly forests and aquifers) and climate change mitigation
measures. Similarly, support is needed for renewable energy projects, and improved dialogue
around this issue, as some participants lamented that rapid progress in concessions has been at
the cost of sufficient dialogue with local stakeholders.
228. Infrastructure: Private sector leaders and Government highlighted the increasing need
for infrastructure development taking advantage of the newly created PPP framework that
facilitates private sector participation, but this requires greater knowledge and the structuring of
PPPs and the preparation of feasibility studies and seed capital.
