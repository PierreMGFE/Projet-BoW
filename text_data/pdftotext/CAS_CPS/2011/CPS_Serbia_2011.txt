EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Serbia has passed through a period of dramatic change. At the time the Board considered the
Progress Report for the FY08-FY11 Serbia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the country was
managing a rapidly changing political and economic environment. A new, reform oriented government
committed to European Union (EU) accession confronted the politically sensitive issue of Kosovo’s
unilateral declaration of independence and the unfolding of the global economic and financial crisis.
ii.
Despite these pressures, the Government has by and large advanced the reforms on which it
campaigned in 2008. Serbia has sustained fiscal discipline, including, beginning in 2009, a 15-month
IMF Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) which required difficult wage and pension freezes. In September
2011, it secured IMF support for a new precautionary 18-month SBA with potential support of €1.45
billion. Most recently, in October 2011, the European Commission (EC) recommended “candidate”
status, an important milestone toward EU membership. The authorities have also taken tough political
decisions, including the arrest and extradition of the last of the fugitive indicted war criminals. At the
same time, the Government pursued its opposition to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence
peacefully and within multilateral legal fora; and despite an adverse ruling continued to cooperate with the
EU and United Nations toward the continuation of talks with Pristina. Serbia has made significant efforts
to re-establish its place in the international community. However, escalating tensions with Kosovo over
customs and border issues, and the failure, to date, to make much progress toward a negotiated solution,
could affect the EC's formal granting of candidacy status.
iii.
Serbia has pursued these reforms while struggling to recover from the crisis which led to a
50 percent spike in poverty and a similar jump in unemployment. The country is also preparing for
elections scheduled for spring of 2012. Managing the former while preparing for the latter will place
increasing pressure on the Government. As in many countries, the challenge is translating tenuous
economic recovery into jobs and poverty reduction in a tight fiscal environment. Serbia needs to become
more competitive and increase productivity. As detailed in the 2012 Country Economic Memorandum
(CEM), this will require attraction and adoption of new technologies, which will in turn depend on a
supportive business environment, capable institutions, a skilled labor force and high quality infrastructure.
iv.
The CPS will support Serbia’s EU accession and help the Government strengthen
competitiveness and improve the efficiency and outcomes of social spending in the context of
severely constrained budgets. The CPS proposes targeted financing, knowledge services and
coordination with donor partners and an expanding partnership with the EC, with a focus on two pillars.

Competitiveness: New interventions in FY12 and FY13 would include a DPL series to reform
non-private enterprises; investments in road rehabilitation; reform of the judiciary, and a new partnership
with the EC on innovation. These would build on the current portfolio of road transportation, cadastre,
and irrigation projects. The recently completed CEM, prepared with the Government and with
contributions from the EC, will provide the platform for engagement in areas where the Bank Group may
not necessarily provide financing but are still critical to promoting strong, export-led growth. The focus of
IFC’s activities will be to create opportunities for growth through supporting the competitive sectors in the
country, investment climate, strengthening domestic financial markets, and facilitating private sector
participation in infrastructure. IFC will facilitate private sector involvement with fresh capital and knowhow to improve productivity, energy efficiency and environmental focus in the corporate sector.

Improved Efficiency and Outcomes of Social Spending: Assistance in the next two years would
come from: (i) a proposed Public Expenditure Management DPL, which will help reduce Serbia’s large
public sector while strengthening social assistance to cushion the impact of the crisis, and (ii) the current
portfolio in health, education, and social protection services. New interventions include a health project
for FY13. The EC has also asked the Bank to support Serbia in strengthening its capacity to monitor and
evaluate social spending. This is increasingly important in light of Serbia’s aging population and its
commitment, anchored in recently adopted fiscal responsibility legislation, to reduce budget deficits.

i

v.
These two pillars were arrived at following close consultation with the Government and are
consistent with the first two components of ECA’s Regional Strategy, as well as the EC’s Europe
2020 Growth Strategy. Indeed, the Bank’s interventions in Serbia are designed to advance the EU agenda
of Smart Growth, with its focus on education, skills, and innovation, as well as Inclusive Growth,
especially its emphasis on job creation for vulnerable groups and modernizing labor markets and welfare
systems. It should also be noted that while not a pillar of this CPS, the Bank Group will remain engaged
in support of the third component of the ECA and Europe 2020 strategies: environmental sustainability.
vi.

World Bank Group support will be guided by three principles of engagement.


Results: The two programmatic DPL series and the Policy Based Guarantee (PBG), underpinned by
high quality AAA, achieved their intended results of supporting difficult policy reform and institutional
strengthening. This CPS proposes to build on these operations. With respect to investment operations,
results were much slower to materialize than originally expected because of delays in project
implementation. Progress is underway, but continued effort is required to accelerate project execution.

Selectivity: The CPS will see a significant consolidation of the portfolio as Bank support shifts to
fewer, larger investment operations. At the same time, the Bank will expand its engagement with
European partners active in Serbia in sectors consistent with the CPS; where the Bank has a comparative
advantage, and where there is demand for Bank expertise in implementation, monitoring and supervision.
This will be particularly helpful in assisting Serbia in executing EC financed investments.

Partnership: Virtually all assistance will be designed to support Serbia’s EU accession; and the
Bank will continue to expand innovative partnerships with the EC, European IFIs and bilateral donors to
leverage external support. Ongoing cooperation in monitoring macroeconomic developments with the
EC’s DG ECFIN; Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) support for Bank implementation of EC financed
projects; and the Bank’s membership in the Western Balkans Investment Framework are key examples.
vii.
IBRD financing during the first two years of the CPS is expected to amount to US$340
million. The Government has asked for lending during the entire CPS period of US$800 million. The
Bank is sensitive to the challenging external environment for Serbia (and the rest of the Western Balkans),
as well as the importance of supporting the country during this critical period as it prepares for EU
accession. Management has indicated the Bank will be as responsive as possible to meet the
Government's borrowing needs. Final lending amounts will depend on IBRD’s lending capacity and
demand from other borrowers, as well as performance during the course of CPS implementation. The
lending program for the last two years of the CPS will be discussed at the time of an early CPS Progress
Report. The CPS envisions total lending to be divided evenly between DPLs and investment operations.
The first DPL, for FY12, is the last in a programmatic series of a Public Expenditure Management DPLs,
and FY13 would begin a new series focusing on the reform of non-private enterprises.
viii.
IFC expects to provide financing of US$600-800 million to the private sector during the CPS
period. The program will depend on the government’s support for the private sector participation in the
infrastructure sectors at the national and municipality levels, further improvements of the business
environment, and the growth outlook in Europe.
ix.
The CPS is subject to risks. Serbia’s overriding challenge is to consolidate macroeconomic
stability to strengthen its resilience against eurozone turmoil. The second risk would be a weakening of
commitment to policy reform as a result of the elections; this could slow EU accession and disrupt the
Bank’s programmatic DPL series. A related challenge will be to guard against deepening frustration with
the protracted waiting period for EU membership (which could last a decade) that now follows October’s
recommendation for candidate status. Third, there are implementation risks stemming from the lack of
capacity of public institutions responsible for the reforms under DPLs and executing Bank financed
projects. Failure to sustain improvements in portfolio management could lead the Bank to cancel or
postpone projects. These risks are mitigated by the current government’s strong record and the
recognition by major parties that domestic and external events will continue to demand prudence.
ii

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.

Political Context

1.
During the past five years Serbia has undergone a remarkable period of political and
economic change. In 2006, Montenegro narrowly voted for independence (which the Serbian
Government immediately recognized); Kosovo followed two years later with its own unilateral
declaration of independence (which the Government to date has refused to accept); the economic and
financial crisis hit Serbia in early 2009, returning hundreds of thousands of people into poverty and
unemployment; and throughout this period Serbian society generally endorsed the Government’s actions
as it captured the last of the high profile war criminals and turned them over to the ICTY1. These events,
which in earlier years might have been expected to strengthen nationalist or radical opposition elements,
have to date not deviated the center of Serbian politics from the agenda of EU accession, fiscal discipline
and structural reform. Serbia has left the past behind and is moving toward a new future.
2.
Nevertheless, eleven years after the democratic removal of Slobodan Milosevic and the final
disintegration of Yugoslavia, Serbia’s transition remains incomplete. Forging a new identity has not
been easy. A recent poll conducted by the World Bank and EBRD—A Life in Transition: After the
Crisis—revealed that only about 30 percent of Serbians are satisfied with their lives, well below the
average for other transition countries (42%) and the average for western Europe (72%); and the sentiment
is little better with respect to expectations for the future—only 30 percent of Serbs believe the next
generation will have a better life, which is again well below the average for all transition countries of 50
percent. Moreover, a large segment of the population is growing anxious for the rewards for their
patience. Polls show growing frustration with the slow recovery and continued high unemployment, as
well as growing fatigue with the reform process and the perceived “moving goalposts” of EU accession.2
3.
The elections scheduled for April 2012 are not likely to change Serbia’s fundamental policy
direction. Despite the current government’s solid economic management throughout the crisis, steady
progress toward EU candidate status, and deftly managed foreign policy, which has returned Serbia firmly
to the international community, growing frustration with “bread and butter issues” (jobs and poverty)
could result in a protest vote. Most observers, however, agree that a change in government is unlikely to
result in a material departure from the current policy orientation. All of the major parties likely to form a
coalition have expressed commitment to EU accession and recognize the need for continued economic
reform to boost employment. That the consensus around this policy direction is consistent with a
pragmatic reading of the electorate suggests both the ultimate resiliency of public support for continued
prudent macro-economic management, as well as the clear recognition that the current regional economic
reality limits the options for radical change.
B.

Economic Context

4.
Serbia is an open economy with unexploited export potential and a GDP per capita of
approximately US$5,150 in 2010. Some 55 percent of total exports go to the EU-27 countries; the main
sectors are: agriculture products, which make up about 20 percent of total exports (mostly grains, sugar,
fruits and vegetables, confectionary products and beverages); iron, steel and metal products (20%);
machinery and transport equipment (17%); and chemicals (9%). Serbia’s exports stalled in the aftermath
of the 2008-2009 economic crisis but have shown signs of rebounding, and are now well above pre-crisis
levels. Nevertheless, there is substantial room for improvement, as its exports as a share of GDP,

currently at about 25 percent, could be 2-3 times larger. Using neighboring Europe and Central Asia
(ECA) economies for comparison, all have export shares of GDP in the range of 60-80 percent. (e.g.
Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland).
Pre-Crisis
5.
The Serbian economy grew rapidly until 2008, fueled in part by new export dynamism and
largely by a significant boost in domestic demand, supported by significant economic reforms since
2000. GDP growth averaged 5 percent per year during 2001-2008, with exports growing at an average
annual rate of around 30 percent, albeit from a low base3. Output rose in real terms by nearly 50 percent
between 2000 and 2008, as the corporate sector started to post profits and the banking sector restructured.
The supply response also reflected increases in productivity and output in recently privatized and de novo
firms, as evidenced by the particularly rapid rates of output growth in those sectors which underwent
extensive privatization (e.g., steel, cement, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar and banking) or attracted foreign
investors.
6.
But the expansion was also driven by domestic consumption, large capital inflows and a
credit boom. It was accompanied by a widening current account deficit and increasing private sector
debt. While real GDP expanded by 47 percent in real terms from 2000 to 2008, domestic demand
expanded by as much as 71 percent. Although exports grew rapidly, consumption and imports also grew
very strongly and as a result the trade deficit reached 26 percent of GDP in 2008. Driven by widening
trade deficits, the current account deficit increased from 8.8 percent in 2005 to 21.6 percent in 2008.
7.
Fiscal policy contributed as well, with the general government balance moving from a
surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of 2.7 percent in 2008. Two ad hoc extraordinary
pension adjustments in 2008 increased spending on pensions from 11.4 percent of GDP in 2007 to 14.3
percent in 2009. Large wage increases were also granted in this period (e.g. wages of health workers
were increased by 24 percent in real terms in 2007). In parallel, revenues declined from 44.2 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 42.8 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower collection of Value Added Tax (VAT),
excises and personal income tax. Inflationary pressures also reemerged in the run up to the crisis, driven
primarily by supply side factors.
Impact of the Crisis
8.
The crisis led to a drop in real GDP of 3.5 percent in 2009. Industrial output declined by
about 20 percent between mid-2008 to mid-2009. Exports fell by nearly 30 percent over the same period,
while imports declined even more sharply. The reduction in the trade deficit paired with strong
unrecorded remittances resulted in a sharp correction in the external account, from 21.6 percent of GDP in
2008 to 7.1 percent in 2009. With decreased economic activity, and lower food and energy prices,
inflation pressures also receded (to about 4 percent). Credit activity fell sharply with the onset of the
crisis. The real year-on-year (y-o-y) growth rate of credit to the private sector fell from more than 20
percent in early 2008 to negative values in the second half of 2009.
9.
The authorities responded with determined fiscal adjustment. These efforts were supported
by the IMF through a new SBA and the Bank through its ongoing macro dialogue in the context of the
two DPL series and the Policy Based Guarantee (PBG), as well as the Public Expenditure Review,
entitled Doing More with Less. The IMF approved a 15-month precautionary SBA for Special Drawing
Rights (SDR) 350.8 million in January 2009. Spending was contained by a range of expenditure

The ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP increased from 20 percent in 2002 to 30 percent in 2008, still low compared
to regional peers.

measures, including most potently a nominal wage and pension freeze, and cuts in subsidies and capital
expenditures; but revenues fell sharply, reflecting the contraction in aggregate demand as well as lower
collection of trade taxes in line with the implementation of the Stabilization and Association Agreement
(SAA) with the EU. As a result, the 2009 fiscal deficit increased to 4.5 percent of GDP. In May 2009,
the IMF approved an augmented arrangement for SDR 2.6 billion (around €3 billion, or 10% of GDP).
The program period was extended to 27 months and the arrangement was made non-precautionary.
C.

Social Development Context

10.
Impressive declines in poverty achieved throughout the 2000s reversed abruptly with the
2008 global economic and financial crisis. Poverty fell from 13.4 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent in
2008, which translated into about half a million people moving out of poverty. The deceleration of
economic growth which resulted from the crisis halted this progress. Poverty jumped back to 6.9 percent
in 2009 and further to 9.2 percent in 2010, according to the Household Budget Survey (HBS). This is
equivalent to around 230 thousand people falling back below the poverty line since the beginning of the
crisis. Growing unemployment from already high levels has been an important result of the crisis,
reaching 20 percent in October 2010. The large unemployment shock might explain why, according to
the Life in Transition Survey conducted in 2010, almost three-quarters of respondents declared to have
been hit significantly (“a great deal” or “a fair amount”) by the crisis. This compares with about 50
percent for all of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.4 The labor market shock had an interesting gender
aspect: while male dominated sectors were harder hit than those in which females were more prevalent,
women found it harder to move out of unemployment and inactivity during the first year of the crisis.
From a wage perspective, women were less affected than men, though considering that their wages are
lower on average they continue earning less than men.
11.
The poorest and most vulnerable have been most affected by these trends. The largest
increases in unemployment were registered in the bottom consumption quintile. For this group, total
unemployment increased by 40 percent between October 2008 and October 2009, and total employment
decreased by 12 percent. A rapid crisis assessment in 2009 explored how the most vulnerable groups in
Serbia were affected by the crisis.5 For these groups the crisis exacerbated long standing challenges by
making it more difficult to find occasional and seasonal jobs in the informal sector, resulting in lower
wages and often delayed payments, causing losses of formal jobs for those who had them, and plunging
households further into debt for items such as utility bills which they postponed paying. Households had
few options to cope with the crisis. Many resorted to changing consumption patterns, and in particular
switching to cheaper foods and reducing the numbers of meals, and looking for additional work in the
informal economy. Not paying utility bills, buying on credit from the stores and resorting to informal
loans were other important strategies. Available evidence points to the positive impact that social
assistance programs had for those who receive it as a regular source of income, even if payments were
often considered insufficient to mitigate the additional pressures confronted by households.6

4

A recent ECA Regular Economic Report (RER) highlighted how in most ECA countries labour market adjustments to the crisis
happened mostly through lower earnings rather than through fewer jobs. Serbia was an exception to this regional pattern.
5
The report looked at the Roma population, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), single mothers and poor rural communities
and conducted focus groups and key informant interviews. IPSOS Strategic Marketing (2009) “ Crisis assessment” -background for the Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction Unit report on the crisis supported by the World Bank. Similar
findings on coping strategies for poor pensioners, another vulnerable group, were found by the “Qualitative assessment of the
pension freeze” -- background report for the preparation of DPL II.
6
In the LITS survey Serbia stands out in the whole region (together with Azerbaijan) as a country where more respondents
favour increasing spending on social assistance rather than spending on health and education as policy priority.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
On September 29, 2011, the IMF approved an 18-month US$1.45 billion Precautionary
Stand-By (SBA) for Serbia, just as the European and international environment worsened and
Serbia’s economic growth began to slow. As insurance in case of need, the SBA supports the
Government’s underlying economic program until end-2012 in order to maintain macroeconomic and
financial stability and improve the investment climate under unsettled global and regional conditions.
After 3.1 percent growth in the first half of 2011, the Serbian economy slowed to a 1 percent pace in the
rest of the year, reflecting the ongoing turbulence in the EU on trade as well as continued weaknesses in
domestic demand. With more than half of Serbia’s exports destined to the EU-15 countries, Serbia needs
traction from the EU to support its own growth; and the trade channel transmitting shocks from Europe is
particularly strong. Annual inflation, which had peaked at 14.7 percent y-o-y in April 2011, decelerated
sharply to reach 9.3 percent in September 2011 and remains on a downward trend, allowing the Central
Bank to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 250 basis points to 10 percent in the six months leading to
November. But high unemployment at 22 percent, continued restrictions on pension and civil service
wage increases, and sluggish credit growth continue to constrain domestic demand.

The Serbian banking sector has improved. Performance y-o-y through end-June 2011 has
strengthened, as total loans and deposits are both up about 5 percent, along with interest income and
equity. The combined capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for banks is near 20 percent. However, headline
NPLs remain unchanged, at about 17 percent. In response, banks continue to add to provisioning levels
(now in excess of 100 percent of classified assets), which should insulate them against credit losses. On
balance, Serbian banks are well capitalized and continue to demonstrate resiliency towards a slowing
4

domestic economy. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) views credit risk as a key near-term
vulnerability, exacerbated by the fact that most bank loans are Euro linked or denominated: thus, many
borrowers are exposed to higher debt service costs in the event of local currency depreciation.
14.
Going forward in 2012, the Government remains committed to the FRL fiscal targets,
recognizing that it will be a challenging year because of modest growth and more fiscal adjustment.
The Government’s fiscal difficulties are compounded by recently adopted amendments to the law on local
self-government, which mandate a significant shift of revenues from the central government to local
governments7 without a corresponding transfer of expenditure assignments. This alone is expected to
reduce the central government’s 2012 revenues by some 1.3 percent of GDP. Further, early Ministry of
Finance (MoF) plans included somewhat optimistic projections of revenues and expenditure cuts. In the
absence of further spending cuts, the consolidated deficit in 2012 would exceed 6 percent of GDP, more
than two percentage points over the target level specified in the FRL. The Government is fully aware of
this situation and is working intensively on a plan to reduce the fiscal deficits to levels foreseen in the
FRL, primarily through further cuts in non-priority expenditures, shifting expenditure responsibilities for
local projects and road maintenance from the central government to local governments, increasing
payment discipline in the public sector, and, possibly, implementing some base-broadening revenue
measures8. The IMF and the authorities discussed policy options during the first review of the new
program in November, 2011. The IMF mission and the authorities reached staff level agreement (subject
to approval by IMF Board in December 2011), and the IMF program remains on track.
15.
Over the medium-term, with prudent fiscal management and the ongoing shift towards
export-led growth, real GDP growth could average 4.5-5.0 percent with high but financeable
financing needs (Table 1). The current account deficit is expected to stabilize at around 7 to 8 percent of
GDP, in part because of sizeable exports of Fiat vehicles (the Government formed a strategic partnership
with Fiat to start production in Kragujevac early in 2012). Although a significant improvement compared
to pre-crisis levels, this is still above the levels seen in more successful new EU member states. External
financing needs will be high, but fully covered under the baseline scenario. According to the IMF
estimates, gross financing needs in 2011 and 2012 will be about €8 and €8.7 billion respectively, or
approximately 25 percent of GDP in each year. With the current account deficit much lower than the precrisis period, debt amortization will account for proportionally more external financing needs, largely due
to high private sector debt amortization of the corporate sector. Financing needs will be covered by
private inflows, including a combination of private investment inflows (FDIs and portfolio), modest net
flows to banks, and disbursements from international financial institutions (IFIs) and other multilaterals,
including IMF, EU and the Bank.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
16.
Given the unfavorable external environment at least over the near term, growth will remain
modest in 2012, picking up in 2013 and outer years, reflecting the gradual shift towards an exportled economy. Growth has been revised down to 3 percent for 2012 from 4.5 percent, with further risks,
7

In particular, the amendments stipulate that 80 percent of the collected wage tax revenues will be transferred to local
governments, significantly higher than the current 40 percent.
8
According to Governments Letter of Intent, the identified 2012 fiscal gap will be brought in line with FRL primarily through
cutting spending. According to the Letter, the fiscal package for 2012 is envisaged to include as the main measures: (i) shifting
spending responsibilities, particularly on capital spending and local road maintenance, from the Republican to local governments
(reducing gap by ¾ percent of GDP); (ii) cuts in subsidies at the Republican level (¼ percent of GDP); (iii) a sharp reduction of
net lending operations (½ percent of GDP); (iv) cutbacks in planned low-priority capital and goods and services spending (¾
percent of GDP); and (v), several minor revenue measures, including increasing royalties for mining rights and measures to
increase tax compliance (¼ percent of GDP).

reflecting gradual stabilization and slow recovery in consumption, and improvements in net exports,
including from the Fiat production. The process would accelerate to a more robust overall growth of 4.5
to 5 percent in 2013 and in the outer years, increasingly relying on exports and investments. This
medium-term growth requires continued fiscal and structural adjustment, consistent with the
Government’s reform program and the EU accession agenda. Higher exports and savings will drive
medium-term growth with improvement in the savings rate coming from public and private sectors.
Public sector savings will be aided by anchoring fiscal policy with the FRL9. Although certainly a
positive development, the FRL is facing “growing pains” – despite its adoption, changes to the law on
local self-government that clearly have detrimental fiscal impact have been passed by the Parliament. But
although not yet as effective in designing policy as hoped, the FRL has been instrumental in framing the
discussion regarding fiscal consequences and providing a mechanism to find offsetting adjustments.

17.
Under the baseline scenario, both external and public debt remains sustainable. External
debt is projected to decline from a peak of 82 percent of GDP to around 63 percent by 2016; in nominal
terms, external debt will increase modestly over the forecast period, but due to gradual recovery in growth
and exchange rate developments10 it will decrease as a share of GDP (Table 2). Despite this projected
improvement, Serbia’s external debt remains high, and as discussed in Box 1 very sensitive to exchange
rate developments; in the case of further significant depreciation external debt could potentially exceed
100 percent of GDP. Public debt is forecast to peak in 2011-12, at just under 45 percent of GDP, and

FRL was adopted in December 2010; it sets the medium-term deficit target at 1 percent of GDP, allowing for some cyclical
adjustment, and outlines wage and pension indexation formulae until at least 2015
10
With the exchange rate stable through 2011, and relatively high inflation, just in this year nominal GDP expressed in Euros
will grow by almost 14 percent (despite very modest real growth). Overall, from 2010 to 2016 external debt stock expressed in
Euros is forecast to increase by about 30 percent, while nominal GDP expressed in Euros is forecast to expand by about 70
percent.
6

then gradually decline to below 40 percent of GDP by 2015. Strong policies and structural reforms
(including those supported by Bank programs) will underlie higher growth rates and improved public and
external balances, underpinning the declining path of both external and public debt over the forecasting
period. In addition, other debt and debt service indicators do not point to immediate areas of concern.
Spillover Risks and Mitigation Mechanisms
18.
There remain considerable risks going forward, including from the spillovers from the
European debt crisis. Serbia has more than 30 percent of loans and deposits held by Italian and Greek
owned banks. With the late-October decisions by the EU, inter alia, to require leading European banks to
increase their capital, further stress on their respective parent banks’ funding may put pressure on local
subsidiaries to provide liquidity or dividends to their parents, which if realized could potentially cause a
credit crunch. However, the NBS has stepped up its monitoring of banks’ liquidity and other key
performance indicators in light of recent eurozone turbulence. Further mitigating near-term risks, the
local foreign bank subsidiaries currently are rather liquid and well capitalized, providing further assurance
that rapid unwinding of their positions is unlikely. Nonetheless, if there are adverse eurozone spillovers
into Serbia, this could create additional external financing pressures. Also, further major negative
developments in the EU could cause a major drop in exports, which was the driver of growth in 2010-11,
possibly triggering a new recession in Serbia. Under these circumstances, unemployment would remain
high for a protracted period, with attendant social risks.
Box 1: Sensitivity of the Debt Outlook to Shocks
Standardized debt stress tests point to sizeable risks if some assumptions do not materialize: the sustainability of
Serbia’s external debt depends on the stability of the exchange rate and the performance of net exports and growth.
External debt does not decline under scenarios in which exports and growth consistently underperform, thus
underlining the need for strong reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies. Also, there are risks from exchange
rate and other shocks. First, real depreciation of 30 percent would bring the external debt to GDP ratio to about 110
percent. While the debt to GDP ratio declines afterwards, gross financing needs remain elevated. However, further
large real exchange rate depreciation is considered unlikely. Second, a current account shock would see the external
debt to GDP ratio stop declining and stand at around 78 percent in 2016. In this scenario, external financing needs
would be around US$2 to 3 billion (around 3 to 5 percent of GDP) above the baseline in each of the forecast years.
Serbia’s public debt outlook is sensitive to underperformance of growth, delays in fiscal consolidation, and
exchange rate shocks. In the case of a growth rate shock, public debt would start gradually increasing again through
the forecast period and reach about 48 percent of GDP by 2016. Towards the end of the forecast period, gross
financing needs in case of such a growth rate shock would be some 6 to 7 percentage points of GDP higher than in
the baseline scenario. However, Serbia's track record under the IMF, the EU and the World Bank supported
programs, and it is macroeconomic and development policy programs provide comfort that the policy mix will be
adjusted to avoid such a scenario.
Moreover, with more than 75 percent of public debt denominated in foreign currency, a real depreciation shock of
30 percent would push public debt to around 55 percent of GDP. Public debt would then gradually decline.
Without policy change, public debt would increase through the forecast period and by 2016 it would stand at 53
percent of GDP. This further illustrates the need to adjust policies in accordance with the baseline. Financing needs
in this scenario would be significantly higher than in the baseline.

19.
The Government’s performance under previous SBAs and Bank DPLs provides
considerable confidence that external financial pressures will be managed. In addition, although
downside risks are clearly increasing, the IMF estimates that Serbia’s external position is able to
withstand new large shocks: the current account deficit, while still requiring substantial financing, is
much smaller than in 2008, and there is no significant exchange rate misalignment. Further assurance
comes from solid liquidity and capital buffers in the banking system, and a comfortable level of foreign
exchange reserves, significantly exceeding short-term debt. (As of August 2011, gross foreign exchange
reserves are at €10.4 billion, about 30 percent of GDP). However, if even more adverse financial
7

spillovers combine with a more pronounced slowing of global and regional growth, higher access may be
needed to cover external financing gaps. Under such an extreme downside scenario (which would likely
include disorderly resolution of the euro area sovereign debt and banking system), consideration could be
given to retooling the IMF program, as happened under the previous SBA, and also stronger support from
other IFIs including the Bank, combining appropriate policy responses with higher access.
III. SERBIA’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
20.
This CPS builds on an analysis of Serbia’s key development challenges. To achieve its EU
aspirations and continue to improve the quality of people’s lives, Serbia will need to address two critical
and interrelated development challenges: (i) restore strong, sustainable and job creating growth through
improved competitiveness; and (ii) strengthen social sector reforms to improve the efficiency of spending
the quality of outcomes. The Government has demonstrated commitment to address each of these
challenges. Sustaining this commitment in the face of continued, or even increased, economic headwinds
will likely be a key challenge during this CPS period.
Pillar I: Competitiveness
Investment Climate and Public Enterprise Reform
21.
Serbia’s regulatory quality has improved in recent years. Starting and closing a business has
speeded up, getting credit is easier, competition legislation has been harmonized with the EU, there is
greater labor market flexibility, the time needed to register a property has been cut by 40 percent and the
property transfer tax has been reduced. There have also been improvements in the judicial and court
systems, including, importantly, some increased reliability in contract enforcement. These and other
improvements are confirmed in surveys of perceptions by managers.
22.
Key regulatory reforms have contributed significantly to these improvements. The
Government adopted a Regulatory Reform Strategy to reduce administrative operational expenses,
simplify administrative procedures, and improve the legislative process. This goal was primarily
achieved through the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) and Comprehensive Regulatory Reform (CRR)
also known as “the regulatory guillotine”. In addition to identifying the costs of proposed legislation, the
RIA provides a framework for regular consultations with relevant stakeholders. Since 2006, a total of
413 RIA opinions were issued, with 111 opinions in 2009 alone (demonstrating the intensity of regulatory
activity in Serbia). Further, all RIAs were made publically available at www.ria.merr.gov.rs. Finally, a
detailed RIA was performed for several systemic new laws, including the new Law on Bankruptcy in
2009 and Law on Business entities in 2010.
23.
Based on the completed regulatory review, the GoS approved 304 (out of 340)
recommendations requiring the amendments of laws and regulations, and approved the elimination
of 192 regulations. As of end October 2011, 196 recommendations were implemented through
amendments of various laws and regulations, and it is estimated that this will result in annual cost savings
to businesses of around €121 million according to the standard cost model. Implementation of the
remaining 108 recommendations is expected to result in additional reductions in business compliance
costs, bringing the total estimated savings to about €183 million annually. It is important to note that all
regulatory reforms were designed and implemented by temporary bodies—the Secretariat of the Council
for Regulatory Reform and the CRR Implementation Unit—which were staffed with consultants. In order
to ensure sustainability of regulatory reform, the Government has established the Office for Regulatory
Reform and Regulatory Impact Analysis, which will be a first step toward institutionalizing regulatory
reform and RIA.
8

24.
However, in a world (and region) in which most countries are improving their business
environment, attracting investment is a competition. And despite the progress in absolute terms,
Serbia’s relative competitiveness has actually deteriorated. Serbia has dropped four places in the Bank’s
most recent Doing Business report (2012), with an overall ranking of 92 out of 183 countries. In
particular, Serbia continues to fare poorly in terms of dealing with construction permits, which are mostly
the purview of municipal rather than the national Governments (175th place); paying taxes (143); starting
a business (92); and (despite improvement) enforcing contracts (104).
25.
The Government will need to accelerate reforms in a number of areas. Given the findings of
Doing Business, one key area would be a detailed re-design of building permits, including approvals that
have to be provided by public utilities. This can significantly reduce the costs involved and shorten the
time required for businesses to invest and start operations. Regulatory steps can be reduced by taking an
inventory of all administrative procedures at the national level. The same can be done at the sub-national
level.
26.
To enhance its competitiveness and export potential while at the same time reducing the
fiscal burden, Serbia must improve the performances of its public enterprises. This includes further
reducing the presence of the state in the enterprises sector. While the privatization of socially-owned
enterprises11, pursued in the early 2000’s with the support of the World Bank, has achieved substantial
results and has allowed a significant influx of FDI, the agenda is far from complete. Privatization and
restructuring of large (and often problematic) public enterprises remains an unfinished part of the reform
agenda, while performance of municipal utilities needs to be monitored to ensure efficacy in the use of
public funds and quality of service provisions. Indeed, the 2011 EC Progress Report notes that overall,
“state influence on competitiveness through legal and financial mechanisms is substantial.”12 In this
environment such non-private enterprises (owned by all levels and parts of the government) are creating
and accumulating losses and are in need of restructuring, downsizing and much improved standards of
productivity, governance and accountability. This calls for the introduction of a transparent mechanism
for allocating direct and indirect state subsidies - also required by EC State Aide rules – as well as for a
redesign of the role of the state in the enterprise sector to reduce its scope and maximize its effectiveness.
There are governance reasons why the reform of non-private enterprises has slowed, including clientelism
and corruption, but also concerns over social issues arising from labor redundancies. As a result, attempts
to privatize them or to enforce harder budget constraints are often failing. This remains a significant
challenge to any future government as it moves forward in the reform of the public enterprise sector with
a view to improve economic competitiveness in the context of fiscal rectitude.
Governance and the Rule of Law
27.
In October 2011, the European Commission, in recommending Serbia for EU "candidate"
status, noted that “Serbia has a comprehensive constitutional, legislative and institutional
framework which overall corresponds to European and international standards.”
The
accompanying Progress Report observes that Serbia’s public administration is generally well developed at
the central level, though more needs to be done to establish merit-based recruitment and a career system
for the civil service. It also finds that independent regulatory bodies (IRBs) have been established in all
important areas. This was helped in early 2011 by the clarification of rules governing relations between
parliament and IRBs to provide for a parliamentary review of the regular annual reports of the

organization at the time.

Audit Institution, and the Equality Protection Commissioner.
28.
The EC notes that Serbia’s efforts in judicial reform intensified in 2009-2011. Specific steps
identified include the re-appointment process for judges and prosecutors, the introduction of a code of
judicial ethics, the re-organization of the courts, and the adoption of new Criminal and Civil Procedure
Codes aimed at increasing the efficiency of court proceedings. A new administrative court became
operational in 2010. Likewise, Serbia has strengthened the legal and institutional framework for fighting
corruption by establishing an independent Anti-Corruption Agency and a new law on funding of political
parties in line with European standards. Nevertheless, the Report finds that a stronger effort is needed to
significantly improve the performance in combating corruption, which will require more proactive
engagement of law enforcement and the judiciary and a more clearly defined separation of these functions
from politics to ensure independence. Serbia’s progress in strengthening the rule of law, especially by
tackling organized crime, was reflected in the EU’s decision to grant Serbia visa-free travel to the
Schengen area in late 2009.
29.
Still, Serbia needs to strengthen transparency and integrity. The most recent BEEPS13 survey
(conducted in 2008; published in 2010) showed that reported bribe frequency affecting firms remained at
somewhat higher levels than the South East Europe (SEE) and ECA averages, despite having declined by
half from 32 percent to 16 percent in the period 2005-2008. Reported bribe frequency in dealing with tax
administration, customs, and the courts also dropped by more than half during the same period, but
remained above the SEE averages. However, the bribe tax for firms that admitted paying bribes more
than doubled to 4.1 percent of annual sales in 2008, indicating a growing tendency toward grand
corruption. Reported kickbacks paid by firms that admitted to such payments stood at 15.6 percent of the
value of the contract, which was significantly higher than the SEE and ECA averages. The business
transactions most affected by unofficial payments were obtaining an electrical connection (29% of firms
reported that such payments were expected); obtaining a construction permit (19%); and obtaining a water
connection (17%), levels significantly above the ECA average.
30.
Reported informal payments in public service delivery also persist, distorting citizens’
equitable access to services. In the 2010 Global Corruption Barometer, a cross-country survey of
corruption experience conducted by Transparency International, 17 percent of respondents from Serbia
reported having paid a bribe in the past 12 months – twice that of neighboring Croatia, but lower than
Macedonia or Bosnia-Herzegovina.
31.
With its step toward EU candidate status, Serbia will need to accelerate efforts to bring the
performance of the public administration closer to EU levels. In particular, the country needs to
further increase the efficiency and professionalism of the judicial system, and reduce corruption. Toward
this end, it will be important for the Government to systematically monitor the performance of public
sector and regularly evaluate the results of reform efforts, especially those aimed at EU accession.

Box 2: World Bank-EC Regional Cooperation in Strengthening M&E
The EC has expressed interest in cooperating with the World Bank to provide technical support to countries of the
Western Balkans and Turkey to strengthen their institutional capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of
Strategy Implementation in sectors of focus for the EU. Over the last decade, the Bank has worked extensively
with Turkey and the Western Balkans to strengthen government functions associated with the monitoring and
evaluation of policies and programs (e.g. program budgeting, audit, statistical capacity) and is therefore well placed
to carry this work forward. The objective of the project is to increase performance monitoring and evaluation
capacity of IPA beneficiaries in selected sectors at both the level of sectoral strategies and IPA project proposals. In
terms of types of indicators, some will focus on institutional capacity (e.g. in the case of Public Administration
Reform) and others may focus on the quality or efficiency of service delivery. Higher-level goals include
developing sustainable institutional capacity; beneficiary ownership of M&E systems; and ensuring indicators are
useful for public officials in making decisions on policy/ program design and resource allocation. The Bank and the
EC are in discussions for a Bank-executed Trust Fund with a total budget of €1.2 million, including grant
administration fees. The project would begin in January 2012 and last for 18 months. The EC is especially
interested in strengthening its capacity to monitor progress in the social sectors, to track the progress in policy
implementation and evaluate outcomes against identified targets. This work will be particularly relevant given
Serbia’s emphasis on improving on the outcome of its spending on social spending.

Public Financial Management
32.
Improvements in public financial management have been significant since 2007 but there
remains considerable scope for further strengthening. The establishment of a modern, integrated
information system and single chart of accounts has facilitated better accounting and reporting used by all
budget organizations but electronic access to the system is limited to direct budget beneficiaries. The
State Audit Institution has become increasingly effective in auditing the financial accounts of the
Republic of Serbia as well as individual organizations and social funds but still lacks capacity and
experience needed to perform its full mandate. The Budget Systems Law was strengthened in 2009 and
2010 to incorporate many improvements in budgeting, accounting, financial control, internal auditing,
debt management, and fiscal responsibility but few of the changes have been fully implemented. In
particular, integrated strategic planning and medium term budgeting have not taken root, despite support
from the EC, DFID and IMF. The Government has launched an internal audit and financial control
strategy as part of its pathway to EU candidacy, but effective implementation has been difficult. Steps
have been taken to improve on debt and cash management but there remain challenges in monitoring,
coordination and efficient management.
Public Procurement
33.
There have been significant advances in the implementation of public procurement reforms.
Ten essential bylaws have been adopted and published on the Public Procurement Office (PPO) web-site
covering procedures and administrative arrangements since the establishment of the Public Procurement
Law (PPL) in 2009. In addition, the PPO has published a set of standard forms, templates and model
documents to facilitate better practices. The Republic Commission for the Protection of Rights in Public
Procurement Procedures (RCPR) has been appointed by the National Assembly and has been established
as an independent body with generous resources and provision for 75 staff, approved by the Parliament.
34.
Further improvements are necessary, however, to achieve public procurement
arrangements that fully reflect EU requirements and are comparable to international standards.
The current PPL does not fully reflect EU public procurement directives and recent amendments are
under consideration. The RCPR was appointed after considerable delay but it appears further work will

11

be required to meet SIGMA standards.14 The Government is preparing an amendment to the PPL
approved in 2009 to improve the efficiency of public procurement which would imply merging the Public
Procurement Office (PPO), which works as a relatively independent entity supervising public
procurement, with a centralized procurement entity under the Ministry of Finance (Central Procurement
Office). The Bank is working closely with the authorities to arrive at an appropriate outcome. Review of
this proposal, including by the EC, OSCE, UNDP and other external donors, is ongoing to ensure that
efficiency gains can be realized without compromising the transparency and political independence of the
public procurement function.
Box 3: Serbia Multi Donor Trust Fund for Justice Sector Support
Numerous legislative activities have been initiated and completed as part of the harmonization of legislation of
Serbia with the EU Acquis Communautaire and introduction of European standards in the area of the judiciary. A
National Judicial Reform Strategy was adopted in 2006, and a package of judicial laws was passed in the National
Assembly in 2008. The institutional set-up of the judiciary has been adapted and cooperation between the relevant
institutions in the field of justice and home affairs has been strengthened.
Serbia’s parliament provided the legislative framework for a new network of courts and prosecution offices that
became effective in January 2010. The laws on public prosecutors and judges reduced their number to align with
the new court structure. All judges and prosecutors were to be reappointed through open competition based on
qualification and competence, resulting in a 23 percent reduction of positions in the judiciary. Although the EU has
noted Serbia’s progress in a number of reforms and for demonstrating a high degree of consensus in making EU
integration a strategic priority, together with other international partners, the EU voiced “serious concern” in its
Serbia 2010 Progress Report, regarding how recent reforms to the justice system, including the reappointment
process, have been implemented.
The Multi Donor Trust Fund for Justice Sector Support (MDTF-JSS) was established in 2008 to support the
Government’s reform agenda and the EU accession process, and became effective in early 2009. The MDTF is
strengthening aid effectiveness and donor coordination in Serbia’s justice sector through implementation of a
coordinated work program, financed by pooled financial contributions from Serbia’s development partners.
The MDTF-JSS was initially established as a Bank-executed facility. During 2010, the trust fund was amended to
become a hybrid facility that is jointly executed by the Bank and the Ministry of Justice as it became clear the trust
fund could better achieve its objectives though execution of activities by the beneficiary as well as by the Bank.
Component 1 is Bank-executed and provides advisory services primarily through analytical reports, training of
relevant judicial staff, policy dialogue and surveys. Component 2 is Recipient-executed and provides technical
assistance through support to a Reform Facilitation Unit in the Ministry of Justice.
Bank-executed activities, which have largely been completed, include advisory services to the Ministry of Justice,
capacity building for an automated case management system, development of an MDTF-JSS website, a review of
the Serbian National Judicial Reform Strategy, support to a Partners’ Forum of key stakeholders and a trust fund
Management Steering Committee, completion of a Justice Sector Performance and Service Delivery Survey and a
Justice Sector Public Expenditure and Institutional Review. The MDTFJSS is in the process of delivering a review
of cost drivers in courts, a review of the criminal chain process, and support to the Ministry of Justice to develop
the next Justice Sector Strategy

Skills and Education
35.
Serbia is experiencing major labor market challenges. As noted, the economic crisis has
resulted in high levels of unemployment. By 2010, only 47 percent of the working age population (15-64
years old) was working; 11.7 percent were unemployed (equivalent to a 19.9% unemployment rate), and
the remaining 41.1 percent were inactive. Employment rates are particularly low for those with less than
a secondary education, among women, among youth and older cohorts, and among Roma. As such, there
14

EU candidates, potential candidates and European Neighborhood countries in their public administration reforms.
12

is considerable scope to promote economic growth and social inclusion through greater labor market
participation.
36.
Going forward, Serbia will likely experience a strong demand for skills which at present are
inadequately represented in the labor market. A 2009 Enterprise Survey on emerging occupations in
Serbia indicated that only one-third of Serbian firms consider that there is sufficient skills in the existing
workforce—shortages were observed in both specific technical competencies and the softer skills such as
flexibility and adaptability, problem solving and decision-making, communication and organizational
ability. Closing this skills gap will be frustrated by two factors. First, demographics—by 2025 Serbia’s
population is expected to fall by nearly a half a million people; and surveys show that many young people
are looking at emigration to enhance their opportunities. Second, while improving, student learning
outcomes are still low compared with other EU countries (indicated by the scores on international tests,
such as the Program for International Student Assesment) and the school curricula do not sufficiently
develop key competencies required for competition in the global marketplace.
37.
Sustained effort in the education sector is leading to improvements. Notwithstanding the
issues identified above, more of Serbia’s young people are enrolling in school—net secondary school
enrollment increased between 2001 and 2008 from 76 to 83 percent—and fewer are dropping out; today
some 25 percent of youth aged 18-24 are not involved in education or training, down from nearly 33
percent in 2008. The trends are also brighter for women—some 68 percent of women aged 25-34 have
completed upper secondary school, with notable improvements at the tertiary level. Recent initiatives,
such as the 2009 extension of mandatory preparatory pre-school programs, which has led to a significant
increase in preschool attendance, will help build on these gains.
38.
Nevertheless, Serbia confronts challenges in educating its citizens. First, when compared to
its neighbors (and competitors), still not enough of its young people are enrolling in school and too many
are dropping out before finishing. This starts in the earliest grades. In 2008, the net enrollment rate for
pre-school (3-6 year olds) was 52 percent. This compares with 75 percent for Bulgaria, 76 percent for
Romania and 89 percent for Hungary. Recent pre-school reforms are making a difference and these
efforts should continue. At the same time, only one-half (49%) of Serbians have completed at least upper
secondary school; the EU27 average is 71.5 percent. There are also issues of access, especially for more
vulnerable populations. Roma youth, for example, are especially disadvantaged, with only 11 percent
having a lower secondary education and 5 percent having reached upper secondary.
39.
The second challenge is eliminating rigidities which result in a mismatch between supply
and demand in curricula. Indeed, the EC in its 2011 Progress report noted that the ongoing skills
mismatch continues to act as a drag on the development of new segments of the economy and requires
further reforms of the education and training system that would respond better to labor market demand.
Despite the oversupply of schools and teachers for the number of secondary school-aged youth, many
students are not able to pursue the curricula of their choice. For instance, there is an abundance of spots
available to take courses in textiles, wood processing, agriculture and other vocational trades, while the
courses in healthcare, economics, law and general secondary education are oversubscribed. Serbia’s
system forces students to select narrow educational tracks at a young age; this has resulted in more than
76 percent of secondary school students attending vocational education (the second highest percentage in
Europe). Advancement to university education has been expanded, but almost a half of students entering
universities do not graduate. Despite efforts to better tailor vocational curricula to current labor market
needs, the result is a labor force ill suited to the flexibility and intellectual agility required in today’s
knowledge based economy. This mismatch in curricula is compounded by the lack of systematic adult
education and training. The proportion of adults attending formal training courses (of any type) is very
low in Serbia, and at 0.1% of GDP, Serbian expenditures on active labor market policies are considerably

13

below that of new EU member states. A concerted effort to establish a process of life-long learning is
needed.
Innovation
40.
Fundamental to Serbia’s efforts to become more competitive will be improving its ability to
innovate. At present, however, the country’s system of R&D institutions and funding is inadequate to
support its ambitious modernization agenda. Serbian R&D is dominated by the public sector, largely
inefficient, and most importantly de-linked from industry needs, particularly those of SMEs. Private
industry’s capacity, both in terms of human capital and financial resources for R&D and innovation, is
low. Brain drain remains a major concern, not only for the private sector, but also for the scientific
community.
41.
Serbia spends roughly €100 million annually (0.3 percent of GDP) on R&D, with a goal to
reach 1 percent by 2014. While R&D spending has increased from €28 million in 2001, Serbia still lags
significantly behind its neighbors. Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Croatia spend more than 1 percent
of GDP and the European average is 1.8 percent. In Serbia, the majority of R&D spending goes to basic
research, which accounts for 50 percent of all R&D funding. A significant shift from basic to applied
research is needed for the development of an innovative SME sector. This, along with developing
stronger connections between science and industry, will be key in raising R&D expenditures to 2 percent
of GDP by 2020, with a target of leveraging half of this from the private sector.
42.
The Government has undertaken efforts over the last two years to revamp the regulatory
and institutional framework governing science, technology and innovation. It has enacted a number
of laws to promote science and innovation and formulated the Serbian Scientific and Technological
Development Strategy 2009-2014. In addition, the Ministry of Education and Science was created as the
central body responsible for science and innovation.
Box 4: Improving Innovation: EU Partnership
Serbia is also looking for external support and ideas, and has turned to the Bank and EU for assistance. The recently
signed Administrative Agreement to create an Innovation Serbia Trust Fund is an important early contribution,
and the cornerstone of a novel partnership between the Bank and the EU in Serbia. It is, first, the product of the
Bank’s ongoing dialogue with the Government on how to ensure Serbia can create the conditions for a dynamic
entrepreneurial sector and, ultimately, job creation. The Trust Fund also reflects the growing relationship between
the Bank and the EU and the latter’s recognition of the Bank’s long expertise in the area of research,
entrepreneurship and innovation support. The Project will finance the capacity building of the newly established
Innovation Fund of Serbia, matching grant programs for the earliest stages of development in technology-intensive
start ups, and will pilot a technical assistance program tailored to the needs of select research and development
institutes in Serbia to promote technology transfer and commercialization. This work, financed by the EC’s
Instrument for Pre-Accession, is being complemented by Bank analytical work in the Western Balkans and across
the ECA region more broadly that looks at the impact of investment in science and technology on job creation.

Agriculture
43.
Agriculture is critical for Serbia’s development and EU accession. Primary agriculture
directly generates about ten percent of GDP and further contributes indirectly by providing raw materials
for the food industry. Its most significant products in the EU market are cereals and vegetables and fruit,
specifically raspberries, plums and soybean, as well as maize and peppers. Serbs, whether living in rural
areas or cities, see agriculture as the greatest development opportunity for the country. This has not,
however, always led to constructive sector policies. Indeed, because such a large number of the
population—including voters—are somehow connected to agriculture (44% of population lives in rural
14

areas), government policies have often been driven by political rather than economic concerns. The
potential for improvement is massive.
44.
As Serbia approaches EU membership, its farmers can look forward to benefiting from
support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). First, however, they will face the costs of
compliance with its extensive regulation, and experience both the opportunities and the competition of the
single market. Agriculture and farmers face the biggest difficulties on the road to EU membership but
they will also benefit the most upon joining. The SAA will progressively expose Serbia's market to
competition from EU imports. At the same time, the gradual harmonization of production, quality and
sanitary standards will increase the opportunities for trade in both directions. Implementation of the SAA
is already well under way, and by 2013 the average customs duty on agro-food imports from the EU will
have dropped to just 1.7 percent, with most products having no tariff protection at all. Serbia is therefore
under considerable pressure both to meet the conditions for export to the EU, and to achieve full
membership so that it can benefit from all the support of the CAP.
45.
Reforms are taking place, but there is much to do. In addition to the SAA, the Government
has signed an agreement with the CEFTA (Central Europe Free Trade Area), and numerous bilateral
agreements. Serbia is also approaching World Trade Organization (WTO) membership. These linkages
helped Serbia to become a net food exporter for the first time in 2005, with a surplus of about US$255
million; this grew to over US$1 billion in 2010, but still remains well below its potential. With an
average export value per hectare of €385 in 2009, Serbia has lower exports per unit of arable farmland
than every EU Member State except Romania; and the new member states achieve an average of €800/ha.
The sector is also becoming increasingly stratified, with commercial farms that have risen to the
opportunities and challenges of modern agricultural technology and markets improving competitiveness,
and the many small farms, which continue to produce in traditional ways, lagging behind.
46.
Changing agricultural policies in Serbia have created uncertainty. Serbian agricultural
policy has been redesigned in a two-year cycle since 2000, leading to an unstable policy environment. As
a result, even policies that improve the profitability of the agricultural sector may not stimulate additional
investment as expected, because farmers, food processors and input suppliers are not certain whether the
policy measure will remain in place for the lifetime of their investment. Public expenditure on agriculture
is also declining at a time when investment is most needed. The share of public expenditure devoted to
the agricultural and food sector, which has been small by international standards, has declined to 2.5
percent in 2010, and is no longer adequate. And the public investment that is being undertaken has not
been effective. Much of it is targeted to small farmers in specific regions, with little to do with the
country’s strategic objectives for the sector, including meeting EU requirements. Accordingly, more
urgent and more important than increasing the overall budget is reallocation of the existing resources, so
that they focus on the Government‘s priority goals of increasing agricultural competitiveness and
preparing the sector for the opportunities and challenges of EU membership.
47.
Determined policy efforts will be required, such as establishing an effective extension
service. Perhaps the biggest single need is to prepare the supply chains for exporting more and better
quality goods, in line with the issues and priorities identified by the EU’s rural development (IPARD)
sector studies. Priority should be given to those chains where the EU has demanding veterinary,
phytosanitary and food safety standards, which currently present major trade barriers for Serbian exports.
The approach to agricultural policy making must also be changed. This will require increased collection
and use of data by professional policy staff. Ex ante evaluation of proposed policy changes would help to
improve the efficiency of new government interventions, while regular ex post evaluations would ensure
that policies stayed on track and were improved and adjusted as necessary.

15

Land
48.
In Serbia cadastre and land registration functions relatively well. The Republic Geodetic
Authority (RGA) is fairly effective in processing the registration of properties and transactions, and the
RGA system will soon cover the entire country. If reforms proceed at their recent pace, the RGA can
hope to reach EU standards within five years.
49.
Nevertheless, the land sector is still constrained by insecure property rights. One particular
problem Serbia faces is with respect to questions of restitution of land seized by governments dating back
to World War II. Conversion and restitution issues undermine the security of property rights. The
Government has taken many steps in the right direction, including new legislation to resolve old land
rights disputes through restitution or indemnification. The new law on restitution has laid out a clear
process, methodology and timeline for dealing with this issue. The challenge that remains is to fulfill
these commitments with the very limited resources available to the government.
50.
Another fundamental area for strengthening competitiveness is reducing the cost of
construction permits. Due to a lack of urban plans, overly restrictive planning and permitting processes
and corruption at the local level, investors are having difficulty obtaining permits for construction. The
cost in percent of income per capita for obtaining a permit is much higher than in similar economies and
has resulted in Serbia having one of the worst rankings in the world in “ease of obtaining a construction
permit” (176 out of 180). Specifically, it costs more than 1,800 percent of per capita income to register a
property in Serbia; the next highest comparator country is Poland, at 121 percent and the Czech Republic
at 16 percent. Closing this gap is crucial to Serbia’s competitiveness.
51.
There are other areas of concern that the Government needs to address. Because of the
difficulty in obtaining building permits the population has often built without them. Estimates for the
level of informality vary between about half a million to a million buildings. There are proposals to
develop a full building cadastre in which every building, including those owned by the state, is recorded
and its status identified (whether formal or informal). The second is to launch an agricultural land
consolidation program. The benefits of such a program easily outweigh the costs of implementation, and
would include increased production and employment in the agricultural sector, increased market values
for consolidated properties, improved ownership conditions, improved infrastructure, and accurate
property registers and cadastral maps.
52.
All these are fairly new areas for the Government. Capacity to address them must thus be
built at all levels. The key areas for training are conversion, valuation and property management. It may
be beneficial to consider ways of bringing the private sector into this process, as well as to ensure a broad
public consultation process to keep decisions transparent.
Transport and Trade Facilitation
53.
The quality of Serbia’s transport infrastructure appears to be significantly lagging that of
its neighbors and competitors as a result of severe underinvestment and maintenance during the
“lost decade” of the 90s. This is a considerable problem for a country which hopes to capitalize on its
central position in Southeast Europe to be a transport hub for an expanding EU. A 2010-11 World
Economic Report survey indicates the poor quality of Serbia’s transport infrastructure: road infrastructure
ranked is 129th; the quality of rail infrastructure ranked 93rd; and port and air transport infrastructure both
came in at 124. Road safety is also a major issue. Based on 2008 data, the cost of fatalities and serious
injuries suffered on the country’s roads cost the Serbian economy upwards of two percent of GDP.

16

54.
The road sector has seen some improvement, but much of the existing road network
remains a bottleneck for transporters. A survey of the main and regional road network, conducted in
2008, revealed that only 37 percent of the network was found to be in good condition. While this was a
modest improvement, the design characteristics of much of the existing network are below European
standards. This further increases vehicle operating costs and reduces safety and competitiveness.
Maintenance, rehabilitation and construction activities should be planned in advance on a medium-term
development plan for the network.
55.
Railway infrastructure is aging and in poor condition. The average age of the network is 38
years.15 Line speeds do not exceed 60 km/hour on 57 percent of the network, and only 3 percent of the
network has a line speed that exceeds 100 km/hour—this, despite the fact that the average design speed is
94.5 km/hour. Insufficient investments in maintenance have reduced the operational effectiveness of
much of the network. This has led to safety concerns and the imposition temporary speed restrictions,
which further slow transport and, because of lack of maintenance, tend to become permanent. Achieving
EU levels will require a thorough analysis of the structure of the fleet in comparison with market
demands, which will mean real cuts in surplus capacity. Equally difficult decisions will need to be made
with respect to staff levels.
56.
Inland waterways remain a potentially important transport mode in Serbia. While the
potential for inland waterway transport along the Danube and Sava Rivers is significant, a number of
problems remain to be resolved including removing unexploded ordnance and sunken vessels. The
fairway of the Danube River is below the parameters required by the Danube Commission and leads to
restrictions on navigation and impacts adversely on navigation safety—the situation is much worse in the
Sava River, where there is little traffic, due to years of inadequate maintenance. Rehabilitation of the
Danube and Sava rivers is a government priority for the sector to make this low-cost and
environmentally-friendly mode of transport more competitive and reduce inland waterway transport costs
for imports and exports.
57.
Serbia’s performance in trade facilitation and logistics lags behind regional neighbors. It
ranks 74th in the world using the trading across border index of the 2011 Doing Business report, and 84th
in the world using the World Bank’s 2010 Logistics Performance Index (LPI). The LPI shows that Serbia
needs to improve significantly in the area of customs, where stronger integration of border management,
simplification of customs clearance procedures, establishing inland customs clearance, reducing the
number of physical inspections by improving the risk-management system, and mainstreaming
performance indicators are necessary reforms to facilitate trade movements and bring Serbia’s customs up
to EU standards.
Energy
58.
Serbia is well endowed with power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.
Some 55 percent of installed generation capacity is lignite-fired thermal power plants; 40 percent is
hydroelectric power plants, and natural gas participation is expected to grow in the future. While
impressive, Serbia’s energy capacity is coming under increasing stress. Most generation facilities are
more than 30 years old and operating beyond their designed life span. The last power plant was built 15
years ago, with others dating back to the 1960s and 70s. The age and poor record of maintenance has
severely impacted reliability and efficiency. This is also true for Serbia’s power transmission system.

15

Total network length includes 334 km in Kosovo and Metohija, 39 km used only as factory sidings, and 180 km
which are out of service.
17

59.
But lack of investment has left Serbia with twin challenges. The first is to ensure inadequate
power supplies do not stifle the country’s efforts to improve competitiveness. There is evidence that this
is a growing risk. Following five years of reconstruction and stabilization in the early 2000s, the power
sector stabilized. However, prior to the 2008 crisis, electricity supply had become a bottleneck, with
some 30 percent of firms surveyed identifying electricity supply as a major constraint to doing business—
doubling from the same survey in 2005; and many expect that continued shortages are inevitable if action
is not taken. Indeed, in 2008 generation capacity was not able to meet peak demand and the country had
to rely on imports. This suggests an impending supply crunch. The drop in demand resulting from the
global financial crisis has taken the pressure off temporarily, but as demand for power picks up with
recovery, the system could compromise growth for the entire economy. It also has regional implications
as Serbia is an important transit center for electric power transmission, with nearly half of the annual
electricity transiting through the country (2009) distributed to neighboring markets.
60.
The second challenge is to become more energy efficient. The economy uses two times more
energy per dollar of GDP than its neighbors in the Western Balkans and almost 2.5 times more than EU
countries. This is largely due to the composition of its main exports—metals and electrical machineswhich are highly energy intensive. Moreover, with some two-thirds of its electricity needs met by lignite
power plants, Serbia’s energy consumption is also highly carbon intensive, some 10 times more so than
OECD Europe. The country has embarked on a path to adapt its energy and climate policies to meet EU
accession requirements, and is making progress in this direction, but full compliance will be costly.
61.
Serbia can continue to produce adequate power supplies and do it more sustainably. But it
will require significant investments, amounting to a projected €16 billion by 2020, with some estimates
indicating that at least three-quarters of this will have to come from the private sector. Attracting this
level of private investment will require significant policy reforms. Here the first priority is tariff reform.
Despite recent hikes, current tariff levels do not permit the main electric utility to cover its costs, let alone
finance needed investments. The recent adoption of the Energy Law represents a major step towards
incorporation of key provisions of EU acquis, including transfer of tariff setting authority from the
Government to the independent energy regulator. The Government is also finalizing the preparation of a
new legal framework for public-private partnerships. Other steps would include improving the
distribution system, including bill collections, reducing commercial losses, unbundling of distribution and
supply and strengthening efficiency.
Pillar II: Improving Efficiency and Outcomes in Social Sector Spending
62.
As noted above, the 2008 crisis returned some 230,000 people back into poverty. This has
placed substantial stress on Serbia’s complex social protection system. The system, which is really a
collection of poorly coordinated components, has performed with mixed results. These components
include: (i) last resort social assistance for those who are lacking minimum resources; (ii) family and child
protection benefits; (iii) non-contributory disability benefits and; and (iv) benefits for war veterans and
their families. Spending on social assistance is at the average level for ECA countries, about 1.7 percent
of GDP. However, close to two thirds of this spending is allocated to programs which are regressive in
terms of targeting. These include veterans benefits and wage compensation during maternity for working
mothers. On the other hand, while accounting for a much smaller percentage of spending, the last resort
social assistance and the monthly child allowance programs are strictly means tested and well targeted to
the poor. The main drawbacks with these programs are their low coverage and low take up by those who
are eligible. During the crisis, both programs did expand to respond to the increased demand, but
remained too small to reach most of the poor.

18

Box 5: Impact of Crisis on Roma
The crisis has exacerbated long standing challenges for the most vulnerable in Serbia. Bank analysis provides a
vivid illustration of the challenges of the different Roma communities, with households living in slums and
collective centers (informal tent settlements where displaced people from Kosovo, Roma and non-Roma alike, live)
facing the worst living conditions, with precarious housing, no direct access to services such as water and sewerage,
and dilapidated infrastructure. Moreover, low skills, lack of official documents and “prejudice” among employers
remain major barriers to employment. This is borne out by quantitative data. While working-age Roma, (contrary
to public perception) are actively seeking jobs (Roma men participation rates at 72 percent are comparable to those
of majority men at 70 percent), the male employment rate for the Roma stands at 34 percent compared to 58 percent
for non-Roma men. For those who work, earnings are about half of those of non Roma men. The situation is even
worse for women, whose employment rate stands at 9 percent (against 43% for non-Roma women), and whose
earnings are less than one-third of their non Roma counterparts. Gaps in education are an important explanation of
the Roma population difficulty in finding jobs, with only 21 percent of men and 4 percent of women having at least
some secondary education (against 81% for the majority male population and 73% for females). A significant part of
the gap in earnings, however, remains unexplained by the quantity of education, work experience, and locational
characteristics, suggesting that, indeed, prejudice among employers might be playing an important role.
While these challenges remain difficult to tackle, the Delivery of Improved Local Services (DILS) project is
contributing to address some of the access to social services gaps faced by the Roma. In cooperation with the
Ministry of Health (MoH) and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), DILS has supported
the training and work of 75 Roma health mediators (all women) and the project directly funds the salaries of 15 of
them. Roma Health Mediators have helped some 3,600 children obtain vaccinations; more than 2,500 have
registered with a Doctor; some 600 pregnant and new mothers have received health checks and medical follow up of
pregnancy and child birth in hospitals; and more than 1,200 women are now able to choose their gynecologist. This
successful program is likely to be sustainable as the Government would like to institutionalize Roma health
mediators, and in 2012, their salaries will be paid through the national budget of the Republic of Serbia.

Marketing (2009) “ Crisis assessment”

63.
The authorities have taken important steps to address some of these targeting issues, but
challenges remain. Important reforms have been implemented aimed at increasing the coverage of the
poor with social assistance of last resort, while scaling back the categorical “rights based” programs. The
Government enacted a new Law on Social Assistance following an evaluation of its impact on targeting
accuracy, coverage and benefit adequacy of the last resort social assistance. As a result, coverage of the
last resort social assistance program reached 10 percent of the poorest quintile, up from less than 7
percent before. Nevertheless, important areas for improvement remain. In addition to problems in
targeting of cash transfers, the Government has indicated it wants to improve their coordination with noncash social assistance, such as social care and employment services, which are now institutionally
separated and poorly coordinated. Finally, the Government wants to review—and if necessary identify
measures to mitigate—the poverty impacts of specific reforms which necessitate price liberalization and
price increases. The authorities have asked for Bank support on a number of these challenges.

Health
64.
The Serbian health system has made significant progress over the last decade. Outcomes
have improved and more services are delivered at lower cost. Some measures to regulate medical
practices and improve quality of care have also been implemented. At the same time the system faces
major challenges. As in many health systems in Europe, Serbia confronts pressures for increased health
spending, due to the aging of the population, the introduction of new (and expensive) pharmaceuticals,
and the development of new technologies. These exacerbate the fiscal pressures already confronting the
system as a consequence of the global economic crisis. The increase in unemployment and poverty,
which has reduced the Health Insurance Fund’s (HIF) revenue base and increased the pool of vulnerable
groups who must be subsidized from the general budget. The Government will need to find ways to use
19

resources more efficiently, by improving management and furthering the reforms that will create
incentives to use resources more productively.
65.
Serbia now has an epidemiological pattern not unlike most countries in Eastern Europe. In
fact many indicators are equal or better than those in the most recent EU member states. Average life
expectancy, at 73.7 years, is almost equal to the average of new EU member states. It is higher than in
the Baltic countries and roughly equivalent to that of Hungary (73 years) and Slovakia (74 years).
Progress in improving the health status of the population accelerated particularly after the 1990s. For
example neonatal deaths decreased sharply in the period from 1999 to 2006 and its rate is now at a level
comparable to the average of EU member states that joined after 2004. Standardized death rates,
however, remain above the averages of both recent EU countries and older members. They are roughly
equal to the rates in the Baltic countries and Hungary and considerably above the rates in Slovakia.
66.
Government spending on health in Serbia has remained roughly constant as a percent of
GDP in recent years, rising from 6 percent in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2008. As this was a period of
rapid growth in the economy, the budgets of both HIF and MoH have been increasing over time. From
2003 to 2008 HIF spending increased 23 percent in real terms, while the budget for the Ministry of Health
(devoted mostly to prevention, purchase of equipment and infrastructure, and pay for health care for
vulnerable groups) almost doubled.
67.
Given the lingering effects of the crisis and the projected period of slow growth, this level of
spending is not sustainable. The Government has to improve productivity. Serbia spends too much on
hospital care (the percentage of health care spending on hospital care is roughly twice that of OECD
countries) and too little on out-patient care (Serbia spends 24% and OECD 31% of their respective health
budgets). Staffing levels and the mix of medical personnel are also at issue. What is clear is that Serbia
can realize significant efficiencies by reforming the way the system is financed. At present, the budgets
of health care providers, at both the primary and secondary level, are based on the costs of inputs. The
health insurance fund pays providers on the basis of annual contracts, which specify the amounts to be
spent on wages and salaries, utilities, medicines and other supplies. Allocations for staff are based on the
number of authorized staff and salary coefficients. Payments for other recurrent costs are largely based
on the number of beds. Consequently, providers have no incentive to economize on the use of inputs or
the quantity of services they provide.
68.
The Government has initiated reforms in payment mechanisms. For primary care, the
Government has opted for a capitation based payment system. Patients register with an individual doctor
of their choice who becomes the primary point of contact in the healthcare system. This helps limit the
need for referrals and creates a direct connection with the source of payment. To date, progress on this
reform has been stymied by the absence of enabling legislation. For higher level (hospitals) care, the
Government is moving to the DRG (Diagnose Related Group) model, an output-based system, where
hospitals are paid according to the average cost of treating a patient during an entire episode (paying the
average cost creates an incentive to minimize cost of treating a certain case). Many of these reforms are
being supported by the Bank’s PEDPL3.
Pensions
69.
Serbia has the second highest ratio of pension spending to GDP in the ECA region. The
immediate problem is that there are too many pensioners, with many people collecting benefits who are
below the retirement age, and with a level of benefits that is much higher than is affordable. The problem
was exacerbated by two extraordinary pension increases in 2008. With the onset of the economic crisis
later in the year, the revenues of the pension system declined just as the system’s obligations were
increasing. The Government addressed this problem by freezing pensions in nominal terms in 2009. The
20

pension freeze was extended in 2010, with the expectation that a new pension law would be enacted in
2010.16
70.
In 2010, a new pension law was enacted by the Serbian Government. The law reduces the
number of people receiving pensions, the level of benefits, special benefits and privileges for the Ministry
of Interior employees and the military; while at the same time increases minimum pensions. Some of
these reductions were politically difficult, including raising the pension eligibility age from 53 to 58
years; and for widows and widowers from 50 to 55 years. The law also reduces the 15 percent bonus
received by women to 6 percent. These changes faced severe opposition from unions and other politically
powerful groups. In January 2011, the Government raised the minimum pensions by 2 percent, as
required by the new law and has moved forward with incremental hikes during the year. Moving to a
system of indexation to inflation is expected to substantially reduce the fiscal burden of the pension
system in the next few years, with pension spending as a share of GDP set to fall from 13.8 percent in
2009 to less than 12 percent in 2012.
71.
While these changes are significant, further measures will be needed to ensure the
structural soundness of the system. Pension benefits are based on a point system as defined in the April
2003 law. Individuals accumulate personal points based on the length of their contribution history and
their contribution wage relative to the average wage. The Serbian system unusually links the value of the
general point (a measure of the generosity of the benefit) to the indexation that individuals are given postretirement. This de-links the benefits received from the wages on which contributions were actually paid.
Indexing pension contributions to inflation before retirement allows their value to erode over time in a
growing economy, which raises generational equity issues and implies that the younger cohort is
generally worse off. International best practice suggests that the level of contributions should be indexed
to wage growth, while pensions after retirement are linked to inflation. Given the high benefit ratio in
Serbia, moving immediately to the international best practice would be quite expensive, but at some point
the switch will need to be made.
IV. COUNTRY RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES
72.
This CPS builds on Serbia’s articulation of its own development goals and challenges. In
particular, it seeks to support the Government’s goals of becoming more competitive and to shift the precrisis model of growth largely driven by consumption to a model where export and investment become
greater engines of productivity-enhancement, growth and job creation. This goal is spelled out in detail in
a document still under preparation entitled, Strategy and Development Policy for Industrialization for the
Republic of Serbia17. In this paper, the authorities have set out a broad strategy to strengthen Serbia’s
manufacturing and industrial competitiveness while also ensuring environmental sustainability. Key
elements of the strategy include approaches to increase employment, industrial production, regional
development, labor productivity, exports of goods, investment and FDI. This is a comprehensive
document, which in addition to proposing greater emphasis on education and innovation, establishes
specific targets for improvements in efficiency in Serbia’s most important industrial sectors, including
agriculture, textiles, timber and wood products, and metals. The strategy incorporates the EU
requirements on clean production and pollution and carbon emissions. In addition, the Government has
set out a number of national strategies in specific areas, such as education, public procurement, science
and technological development, and telecommunications.

16

Higher-than-expected revenue growth in 2010 allowed the Government to allocate an additional RSD 5,000 to the lowest paid
pensioners (those receiving less than RSD 30,000 per month) as a one-off payment to help compensate for the recent inflation.
17
Government of Serbia, in progress.
21

73.
A second clear objective to which the Government has remained committed is sustained
fiscal discipline. Through engagement with the Bank and the IMF, the Government has made clear its
commitment to improving the allocation of public expenditure; strengthening public debt management;
and protecting social assistance to cushion the impact of the economic crisis and expand the coverage of
social spending. The adoption by Parliament of fiscal responsibility legislation in early 2011 and the
credibility acquired by the new Fiscal Council following its creation under this legislation are evidence of
the country’s commitment to fiscal discipline.
74.
Finally, the strategic setting for reforms in Serbia is defined by the Government’s
commitment to Serbia’s integration into the EU. As noted above, the overall direction comes from
Europe 2020. Country specific guidance is provided by selected monitoring reports, which outline a
roadmap for action. The Government’s latest strategic document that defines the agenda of EU
integration is contained in the 2008 National Plan for Integration. This detailed document explains the
Government’s priorities for the harmonization of Serbia’s institutional and legal framework with the
EU.18 Important progress on EU accession has been made in 2010 and early 2011. As noted above, in
October 2011, the Commission recommended Serbia for candidate status.
Indeed, in its
Recommendation, the EC notes that “Serbia has built up a positive track record in implementing its
obligations under the Stabilization and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement” and that
“Serbia would be in a position to take on the obligations of membership in the medium term, in nearly all
acquis fields, provided that the alignment process continues and that further efforts are made to ensure the
implementation and enforcement of legislation”. While EU membership is years away, Bank’s support
under the CPS is intended to support policy continuity.
V. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY
A.

Bank Program, Lessons Learned and Partnerships

75.
The FY12-FY15 CPS is designed to build on the strong policy reforms supported during the
previous CPS. First, it proposes DPLs in each year intended to deepen and expand upon important
reforms undertaken under previous Bank supported policy lending. This is particularly true with respect
to the third operation of the public expenditure management DPL series, which was launched in response
to the crisis at the Government’s request to help improve productivity and efficiency of public spending.
Significant reforms undertaken in recent years, including revised fiscal legislation and a more strategic,
efficient budget process, strengthened internal control and audit functions, and improvements in the
regulatory framework for procurement, have all been supported by the DPL Series. The proposed DPL
series on restructuring non-private enterprises will similarly build on the Private and Financial Sector
DPL series and the Policy Based Guarantee from the previous CPS, which supported improvements in the
business environment, strengthened financial discipline in the non-private enterprise sector, and assisted
in building a more stable and efficient financial sector.
76.
This CPS will see a greater focus on selectivity, with a shift to fewer, larger, investment
operations. The Bank will continue to work closely with the authorities to consolidate the recent
progress in accelerating project disbursements. New investment lending, which is back-loaded to later in
the CPS, will be for fewer and larger investment operations carefully targeted to support the CPS pillars.
This will help improve portfolio performance. It will also free up internal Bank resources for timely
analytical products, thus strengthening the ability of the Bank to engage in advocacy, knowledge
dissemination and dialogue in areas where it does not necessarily provide direct investment financing but
where other development partners look to the Bank to play a leading or complementary “Knowledge

22

Bank” role. In addition, it will enable the Bank to respond to requests from the EC and other donors for
project implementation assistance through an expanding agenda of externally financed trust funds.
77.
The Bank will continue to expand partnerships with the EC and other development
partners in Serbia to advance its EU accession. Trust Funds managed or implemented by the WBG
total US$25.8 million and provide additional financing to support the CPS goals. The EC has approved a
grant for innovation in the amount of €8.4 million, and is expected to approve a grant for justice sector
strengthening for €2.6 million and statistical analysis for €830 thousand. Among bilaterals, SIDA is a
particularly important development partner, with trust fund support in the justice sector. Recent TF
programs, such as the ones agreed with the EC and SIDA, were designed to cover the World Bank costs
to manage their implementation. In addition, Serbia is benefiting from a number of regional TFs,
including, public financial management, private sector accounting—through the Vienna based REPARIS
(Road to Europe Program of Accounting Reform and Institutional Strengthening)19 facility—and R&D
and innovation. Details of each of the TFs and the amounts allocated are included in Annex 3.
78.
IFC expects to provide financing of US$600-800 million to the private sector during the
CPS period. IFC seeks to improve Serbia’s competitiveness through its investment and advisory service
products, targeting competitive and export-oriented companies as well as the under-served segments of
the economy such as the SMEs and agribusiness sectors, energy efficiency and renewable energy, and
municipalities and rural areas. Also, through its regional programs, IFC will help Serbia to make further
progress in improving the business environment.
Current portfolio
79.
The World Bank supports a portfolio of 12 operations with commitments totaling US$841.8
million (November 15, 2011). These operations are financed by 8 IDA credits totaling US$217 million,
10 IBRD loans of US$620.3 million, and 1 GEF grant of US$4.5 million. The FY11 disbursement ratio
was 10.3 percent, and through the first quarter of FY12 reached 8 percent.
80.
The disbursement ratio throughout the CPS FY08-11 period was well below ECA and Bank
averages, and lagged behind Serbia’s own historical averages (see Table 3). This was to a great extent
caused by challenging internal political developments (presidential elections, the declaration of
independence by Kosovo, and parliamentary elections), and the global crisis in 2008-2009. These events
led to widespread political uncertainty for an extended period and contributed to an 18-month delay in the
ratification by parliament of five Bank operations approved at the end of the previous CPS period. The
same political and economic factors also distracted decision-makers’ attention from the implementation of
projects already in the portfolio. Moreover, the formation of the government by a complex coalition
comprised of 13 political parties frequently affected project implementation, most prominently in cases
(such as the Corridor X project) where it was necessary to reach agreement among government
institutions headed by officials representing different coalition partners with divergent philosophies.

81.
With progress already evident, it is anticipated that disbursements will accelerate
significantly under the new CPS. Indeed, less than half way through the fiscal year the disbursement
ratio of 9.2 percent is approaching the average annual figure for the preceding two years. Intense
engagement is paying off. Steady dialogue with the authorities, including regular and high-level joint
portfolio reviews have begun to lead to faster project disbursement. It is clear that strengthening the
Ministry of Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-à-vis the implementing agencies have
helped improve portfolio performance. In particular, and especially in the context of Serbia’s complex
coalition government, the recent efforts to engage the concerned ministers themselves in a regular
dialogue on the portfolio has reduced decision-making time, contributed to instill a sense of urgency in
Project Implementation Unit staff and eliminated some cumbersome bureaucratic steps. Continued
consolidation of the portfolio, moving toward fewer, larger projects, streamlining project components and
objectives, continued proactive management of the portfolio, including selected restructuring and
cancellation of projects, and, finally, moving forward on the large Corridor X project (accounting for
more than 40% of the total portfolio in US$ terms), now that most of the major contracts have been
signed, will help consolidate these promising gains.

IFC expanded its activities sharply in Serbia during the past CPS period (FY08-FY11).
Commitments rose to US$455 million (US$351 million its own account and US$104 million through
mobilization), from US$260 million in the previous four years. IFC’s committed investment portfolio in
Serbia stood at US$439.8 million (as of September 30, 2011), spread across 15 projects in the financial
sector (72 percent) and in the real sector (28 %), making it IFC’s largest portfolio in the Western Balkans.
IFC’s portfolio is concentrated in the financial sector helping with the capitalization of three systemic
banks, including the largest state owned bank and the second largest bank in the country. In addition, IFC
has financed US$104 million through mobilization with other financial institutions that sends a strong
positive signal at the time when the economic recovery in Serbia needs to gain momentum and
international demand outlook remains uncertain.
83.
In parallel with increased investment activities, IFC has been helping Serbia improve its
business environment through its advisory programs focused on: (i) strengthening sub-national
competitiveness in four municipalities; (ii) improving corporate governance; (iii) strengthening
24

international standards and technical regulations; (iv) improving access to finance with special attention
to energy efficiency finance; and (v) promoting private sector participation (PSP) in solid waste
management.
84.
The current net exposure of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) as of
August 31, 2011, amounts to US$401 million in 11 projects, which makes Serbia the Agency's third
largest net exposure country. The majority of these projects are in support of foreign banks' loans to
their Serbian subsidiaries, some of them in the aftermath of the 2008-09 global financial crisis. However,
the majority of the exposure comes from a series of recent reinsurance contracts supporting a foreign
retail operation in the country. MIGA’s continuing support to these projects signals the Agency’s efforts
to continue to underwrite projects in Serbia, encourage inward FDI, and add to the World Bank Group’s
strategy of encouraging private sector development in the country.
Lessons from the CPS Completion report
85.
World Bank Group support over the FY08-FY11 CPS was highly relevant under both
pillars of the FY08-11 CPS. The CPS Completion Report identified a number of lessons related to the
overall strategy, project implementation, and Bank and borrower performance that are helping to guide
the new CPS. Key lessons are noted below:
86.

Key lessons and recommendations for the new CPS can be summarized as follows:


The emphasis on reform areas associated with EU Integration should be maintained,
given the wide political and popular consensus on the EU perspective for Serbia.



DPLs underpinned by high quality analytical work are an important tool in effecting
change in the Serbian context, including by helping to define a comprehensive reform
program and to maintain the commitment of diverse actors.



Investment operations are most successful when relatively narrowly focused on a few
related objectives and when primary responsibility for implementation rests with a single
agency.



Institutional arrangements and implementing agencies’ commitment to project activities
should be carefully considered during preparation; additionally, attention should be paid
to the availability of dedicated staff resources to carry out implementation activities in a
timely way.



Steady consolidation of the portfolio with a focus on fewer, larger projects is likely to
help maintain focus and ensure attention from high-level officials; strengthening the
Ministry of Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-à-vis the implementing
agencies could also improve portfolio performance.



Close coordination with the EC, other International Financial Institutions (IMF, EBRD,
EIB), and bilateral partners is vital to maintaining the momentum of the reform agenda
and reducing strain on limited capacity.



The Results Framework, and monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened in the
next CPS and careful attention should be paid to the availability of appropriate
instruments to support the achievement of stated outcomes.



The Bank should continue to strengthen ties with development partners. With the EC and
IFIs (IMF, EBRD, EIB, CoEDB) in particular, but also with bilateral donors.

87.
Donor assistance in Serbia has come significantly from European institutions, including
assistance through the EU IPA mechanism. Under IPA 2011, EU pre-accession funds worth €178.5
million will be allocated to 23 projects in Serbia (plus an additional roughly €25 million for Cross
Border Programs). Key sectors include justice and rule of law; reform of public administration; private
sector development; agriculture, and rail modernization. Substantial sums are also being invested in
social development and reconciliation among peoples in the region and environmental protection and
combating climate change. This represents the fifth installment of grant funding, totaling €1.4 billion
allocated by the EU for Serbia in the period 2007-2013. 20
88.
European IFIs also play a major role in Serbia. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is
increasingly active in Serbia, with total approvals during 2001-2010 amounting to €3.1 billion, of which
€885 million was approved in 2010. Nearly half of EIB’s financing has been to support badly needed
upgrading of Serbia’s road transport network. The current portfolio also, however, includes projects
financing SMEs in the knowledge economy, energy, environmental protection, industry, health, education
and services. EIB is also investing in FIAT Small Cars Serbia for the modernization and expansion of
production capacity of the existing Zastava auto motive plant in Kragujevac. EBRD has been the
country’s second largest investor since 2001 committing almost €2.5 billion to the country. Its focus in
Serbia has been development of transport infrastructure, boosting small business and promoting
renewable energy. In 2010, EBRD committed €590.5 million across 24 projects in the following
categories - Corporate: 17 percent (agribusiness, manufacturing and services, property and tourism and
telecommunications); Energy: 15 percent (natural resources and the power sector); Financial institutions:
27 percent (includes investments in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises via financial
intermediaries); and Infrastructure 41 percent (municipal environmental infrastructure and transport).
Bilateral assistance from Germany (KfW and GIZ), USAID, Switzerland, Sweden and Norway is
significant, with a number of other donors also present. Bilateral assistance focuses on supporting the
Serbian government create democratic legal and state framework and institutions, as well as a modern
market economy.

Box 6: A successful partnership - EC and the WB in Serbia and the Western Balkans
The European Commission (EC) and the World Bank are cooperating productively in Serbia. Planned activities
include IPA financed trust funds to support work in innovation, described in Box 4, justice sector strengthening in
Box 3, a survey on income and living conditions, and for regional monitoring and evaluation of public spending in
Box 2. The EC has already supported the Public Expenditure Management DPL series under the previous CPS with
direct budget support and extensive TA in the area of PFM, and has contributed to the Delivery of Local Public
Services project and the Real Estate and Cadastre and Registration project. The Bank is also in discussions with the
Directorate-General for Employment (DG-EMPL) toward cooperation in the Western Balkans on poverty and
inclusion, Roma and pensions, and collaborates closely with the Directorate General for Economic and Financial
Affairs on Bank DPLs and analytical work, as well as EC macro financial assistance and country progress reports.
Finally, opportunities for deepening cooperation are regularly discussed with the EU delegation as well as by means
of an annual country coordination meeting with DG Enlargement in Brussels.
Further possibilities for cooperation between the EC, European IFIs and the Bank in the Western Balkans have been
opened by the agreement in June 2011 to grant associate membership of the World Bank Group to the Western
Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF). The WBIF is a financing mechanism designed to pool grants, loans and
expertise from the countries of the Western Balkans, the EC, IFIs and bilateral donors to prepare financing for a
common pipeline of priority investment projects. This framework provides for the possibility to allocate some of
the funding to analytical, policy reform and sector strategy work as well as capacity building. This new type of
project, called a "sector development project" would be complementary to the other types of support currently
provided by the WBIF (mainly technical assistance and co-financing). These grants would be linked to future
investment plans and open possibilities to finance projects through the blending of grants and loans. Similarly, the
policy based work and sector strategies funded in this way could also lay a solid foundation for sector based
approaches to be implemented under national IPA envelopes, such as in Serbia, as well as to improve the overall
policy, institutional and regulatory environment for all domestic and IFI investment projects. 21

89.
This CPS has been designed in close cooperation with Serbia’s development partners to
build on these investments and advance its EU accession. As noted, the CPS is closely aligned with
the EC’s Europe 2020 Growth Strategy. It has also been closely informed by the EC’s Annual Progress
Reports and the Multi-annual Indicative Planning Document (MIPD), the primary strategic planning
instrument for assistance to Serbia in the framework of IPA. Finally, it reflects expanding dialogue
between Bank Group and EC staff and management in Brussels and Belgrade. This is increasingly
important given, as noted above, the significant financial resources with which the EU is providing
Serbia. The EC monitors progress in each potential candidate country along three key areas: political
criteria; economic criteria; and ability to assume the obligation of membership in various sectors, and
issues annual reports on the progress achieved. The matrix in Table 5 illustrates where current and
proposed Bank Group assistance is supporting these three priority areas.

This CPS is the product of intensive dialogue with Serbian authorities, civil society, and
donor partners. The co-chairing (with the EU Delegation) of regular Informal Donor Coordination
meetings provided the World Bank office with a platform to exchange views with donor partners on
country priorities, strategies for assistance and discuss complementarity of efforts. Meetings were also
organized with civil society representatives, members of think-tanks and opinion-leaders and shapers to
hear their views regarding country challenges, the role of the World Bank Group and its areas of greatest
“competitive advantage”. In particular, knowledge acquisition and dissemination as well as “advocacy”
for overall economic as well as sectoral reforms were identified as critically important roles expected
from the Bank Group, going forward. Finally, it is planned to engage with members of relevant
Committees from Parliament, as soon as the parliamentary agenda permits to exchange views on the
proposed strategy, its rationale and objectives.

B.

Planned Lending and AAA

91.
With the overall objective of supporting Serbia’s European integration, it is expected that
this CPS will: (i) support economic growth by tackling some of the bottlenecks to improved
productivity and competitiveness; and (ii) strengthen the efficiency and outcomes of Serbia’s social
sector spending. The CPS recognizes that the goals of competitiveness and improved social sector
spending and outcomes are often fundamentally interrelated.
92.
Planned lending during the CPS period is underpinned by AAA activities carried out over
the past 2-3 years and new AAA activities (both country-specific and regional). Design of each of
the major lending activities foreseen for the CPS builds on recently-completed or ongoing AAA activities.
In particular, the entire CPS has been shaped by a comprehensive Country Economic Memorandum,
Productivity and Exports: the Path to Prosperity prepared with the Government and in collaboration with
the EC. Further, Public Expenditure DPL series has been shaped fundamentally by the Public
Expenditure Review carried out during the previous CPS.

Expected Outcomes
I: Competitiveness
93.
Serbia confronts a large competitiveness agenda. As noted at the outset, the focus of this CPS
on improving Serbia’s competitiveness through investments in productivity is consistent with the Bank
Group’s broader strategy for the entire Europe and Central Asia region, as well as that of the European
Commission, as detailed in Europe 2020. In this context, it reflects the continuation of the previous CPS,
which was developed and later refined with these principles central to the dialogue between the Bank and
the Serbian authorities. It is also the very specific product of the 2012 CEM, Productivity and Export: the
Path to Prosperity. This comprehensive analysis of the Serbian economy has been prepared in close
coordination with the Government and with important contributions from the EC, through the Directorate
General for Economic and Financial Affairs (ECFIN).
94.
IFC plans to expand its activities further during the CPS period. The corporate sector
continues to face difficult economic environment due to weak demand in the international markets and
limited growth opportunities in the domestic market, which are being exacerbated by scarcity of longterm borrowing. Companies have not yet started investing in new capacity as the demand outlook
remains uncertain and long-term capital has become more expensive, reflecting higher risk premiums. To
mitigate the negative effects of the economic slowdown, IFC will continue to establish long-term
relationships with competitive local and regional private sector companies that have strong fundamentals,
and are well-positioned to grow as the economic recovery gains momentum. IFC will look for
opportunities to increase its investments in agribusiness, one of Serbia's traditionally strong economic
sector. IFC will support cost competitive companies with export potential and strong business
fundamentals, especially those which have the capacity to become regional leaders. Through its financing
and advisory services, IFC will target the under-served segments of the economy such as the MSMEs,
energy efficiency and renewable energy, municipalities and rural regions in the country.
95.
In the financial sector, IFC has a substantial investment portfolio in Serbia’s financial
markets which represents a strong base for playing an important developmental role. IFC can
support privatization of its two portfolio banks (the second largest bank in the country and a small
regional bank). In addition, IFC will explore the opportunities to help Serbia develop local currency
financing to reduce exchange rate risks connected with increasing euroization of the economy. IFC will
also consider expanding its financing for regional insurance companies and supporting government efforts
to complete privatization in the insurance sector. IFC can play a critical role in WBG crisis response by
supporting Serbia’s systemic banks in achieving growth and sustaining liquidity. IFC would be able to
provide rapid and coordinated response that is demand driven and can be rolled out with active
coordination with other partners. IFC’s support could include: (i) short-term and trade finance to address
immediate liquidity concerns and maintain trade flows; (ii) mezzanine and equity investments to shore-up
capital, and (iii) SME funding through financial intermediaries.
96.
CPS Outcome: Improved Infrastructure: The 2011 EC Progress Report notes Serbia’s strategic
geographic location in South-East Europe and the important role it has to play in building trans-European
networks in the region. Other areas identified as requiring investment and policy reform included

agriculture and energy. While noting progress in these areas, the Report finds that Serbia will
have to make additional efforts to align the sectors with the EU acquis. 


The ongoing Corridor X Road Transport project will increase transport efficiency and
improve traffic safety on a major road corridor connecting Serbia with key markets to the north
and south. It will reduce the cost of transport for all goods, thereby reducing the cost of imports
30

and will also contribute to making exports more competitive. The project will facilitate increased
traffic, which itself will bring additional benefits to Serbia in the form of additional toll revenue
to maintain the roads. Expected outcomes during the CPS period include reduced user costs and
crash related deaths and serious injuries. The proposed Road Maintenance & Safety project
will be designed to improve connectivity and thus encourage economic development in regions
not directly linked to the new highways and improve road safety.


The Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation project, which is expected to close by end FY13,
is building capacity for increased agricultural yields through support to high priority rehabilitation
of drainage and irrigation infrastructure, and improving water resource management. Outcomes
expected during the CPS period include adoption of the Water Law, legislative establishment of
Water Users Associations (WUA); and developing irrigation schemes.



The Bank is supporting Serbia’s participation in the South East Europe Energy Market, and
eventual integration into the EU energy market, through the on-going ECSEE APL3 project.
The operation is improving electricity market access for consumers and suppliers through an
increase in the quantity, quality, reliability, safety, and efficiency of the bulk power transmission
system. Discussions are also underway for support later in the CPS for an Energy Strategy.

97.
IFC expects that infrastructure reforms will advance in Serbia. Such reforms would allow
IFC to play an important role by facilitating private sector participation in the infrastructure sector. Due
to the country’s limited borrowing capacity, the introduction of PPPs on a wider scale could finance
infrastructure development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability. IFC would support PPPs with
its Belgrade-based Infrastructure Advisory Team. In the municipal sector IFC will build on its experience
with an earlier Integrated Solid Waste Management advisory program which helped a selected group of
municipalities to prepare proper project documentation for the construction of a new waste management
center and financing of two regional landfills. IFC will seek other opportunities in the areas of landfills
and waste management, water and waste water management, road infrastructure, district heating and
urban transport.
CPS Outcome: Improved Investment Climate: The Government is committed to developing a better
understanding of policy actions that would be most effective in improving Serbia’s export performance.
The Bank is working closely with the authorities on a Country Economic Memorandum entitled
Productivity and Export: the Path to Prosperity. The comprehensive and highly detailed report (i)
provides a review of Serbia’s macroeconomic situation and its progress on structural reforms including
the political economy around it; (ii) presents the current status of Serbia’s exports, including a discussion
of its various regional trade arrangements and an analysis of which sectors Serbia has a revealed or
potential comparative advantage; and (iii) identifies obstacles to improved productivity in key sectors,
including power supply and efficiency, use of land, transport and logistics. Additional analysis and TA
will complement the CEM, providing a regional perspective on key issues of competitiveness. This
includes the ECA Region’s Regular Economic Reports and the Western Balkans Public Financial
Management TF.


One of the clear areas identified by the EC as requiring strengthening for faster growth and more
rapid EU accession was the justice sector. The Multi Donor Trust Fund for Justice Sector
Support project is addressing these and other key issues which are compromising the efficiency
and perceived integrity of the courts. Key elements of the project include facilitating Serbia’s EU
integration process and establishing justice sector performance benchmarks. The MDTF—JSS is,
among other things, supporting the introduction of an automated case management system and
mobilizing resources for a comprehensive information technology strategy.

South East Europe is increasingly vulnerable to climate related catastrophes, and would benefit
significantly from better insurance coverage for Serbian businesses and households in the event
of a natural or climatic disaster. Serbia’s participation in the Regional Southeastern Europe and
Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF) was approved in March 2011 by
the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors and is expected to become effective in January 2012.
The objective of the SEEC CRIF is to increase access to financial protection for the Government
as well as homeowners, farmers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from losses due to
weather extremes caused by climate change and relevant geo-hazards, such as earthquakes,
landslides, droughts, and floods.



Also, Serbia is a participant in the Road to Europe – Program of Accounting Reform and
Institutional Strengthening (REPARIS)22. This program is helping to adapt laws and
regulations governing financial reporting and develop institutions, and to bring the financial
reporting framework into line with EU requirements.



The 2011 EC Progress report notes the substantial influence Serbia’s large State presence in the
economy has on competitiveness, including state-controlled monopolistic structures in place
in energy, telecommunication, agriculture and tourism. The proposed Private and
Financial Sector DPL programmatic series proposed in this CPS, to begin in FY13, would
focus on identifying an irreversible time-bound process to resolve and/or improve the efficiency
of non-private enterprises. It would help establish a governance model of state-owned enterprises
and large conglomerates to create transparency on the support provided by the state and
investment decisions in a unified and coordinated manner, moving towards the corporatization of
the enterprises; and it would help ensure that companies remaining in public hands—including
ones for which government intervention is dictated by the nature of the industry (natural
monopolies)—deliver positive economic results for both shareholders and consumers.



The DPL will include a social pillar to address the potential effects reform of non-private
enterprises could have on employees and other stakeholders. This pillar will be informed by a
number of past and ongoing analytical efforts. Recent studies showed that the “regular”
unemployment benefit program will not be sufficient to meet the needs of workers in areas likely
to be hit the hardest (e.g. mining towns). And despite recent reforms, social assistance of last
resort reaches only a fraction of the poor and is not very generous, so it would not be able to meet
the needs of a large majority of dismissed workers. Active labor market policies will be needed.
A 2006 Labor Markets Study looked at the challenge of compensating and redeploying redundant
workers, following large number of privatizations and reforms undertaken earlier in the decade.
The study reviewed the Government’s efforts in 2002 and later in 2005 to strengthen a Social
Program which offered affected workers a choice of different severance options, including one
whose primary focus was labor market programs. The study showed that few affected workers
opted for these programs, and instead chose one of two remuneration options. Additional work is
ongoing, including ESW on Smart Safety Nets which is helping to identify how to link safety
nets and activation policies. Finally, Serbia has had some successful initiatives to build on. One
such program provides subsidies to employers for newly created jobs, as well as self-employment
grants. A rigorous impact evaluation found that this program has had a significant impact on
employability, with many beneficiaries still employed after two years.

22

REPARIS is a Bank executed (hybrid) multi donor trust fund currently financed by the governments of Austria, Switzerland
and Luxembourg, and managed by the World Bank Centre for Financial Reporting.

32



Together with the introduction of a social pillar, the Bank will conduct a Poverty and Social
Impact Assessment (PSIA) which will inform the preparation of the DPL over the coming
months. This will include ex-ante simulations of the reforms supported by the DPL; a qualitative
and quantitative analysis of the characteristics of the workers likely to be affected; their skills and
experiences; and their prospects for future employment. This analysis will be fundamental to the
design of the compensatory measures to be supported under this DPL. Moreover, to ensure
continuity throughout the programmatic series, a baseline analysis and follow up tracer studies
are planned to monitor the impact of the reforms and the compensatory measures. This consistent
monitoring should be very helpful, as it will help inform and adjust the design of successive
tranches of the DPL.
Box 7: The State as a better manager of its own public enterprises - New DPL Series

Serbia and the Bank have had a long and complex experience in restructuring thousands of SOEs. In the early 2000s
the Government took steps to reform its enterprise sector, primarily through the privatization of the majority of
socially owned enterprises. The Government successfully privatized nearly 2,500 companies, raising approximately
€2.6 billion. Further, to date the bankruptcy process has been completed for nearly 400 qualifying companies.
Despite the scale of the privatization efforts to date, the role of the state in the corporate sector remains pervasive:
there are some 250,000 employees still working in approximately 1,300 socially-owned, state-owned, and municipal
enterprises, representing nearly 14 percent of the formal workforce. The large presence of the state in the enterprise
sector has direct fiscal implications for state and municipal budgets. While direct subsidies from the National Budget
are circumscribed to only two large state-owned enterprises (the railways and a coal mine), indirect subsidization in
the form of tax, social contribution and pension arrears are significant, and government guarantees are a source of
potentially costly contingent liabilities. Based on a preliminary analysis, the Bank estimates that close to €290
million is allocated to direct subsidies, or close to 4 percent of government budget, while indirect subsidies could
represent double that figure. Additionally, in 2010, government-issued guarantees to state owned enterprises were
in the vicinity of €700 million.
The privatization efforts so far were primarily focused on resolution of socially owned enterprises, while large state
owned enterprises, including natural monopolies, as well as municipal utilities have largely remained in government
control, raising issues of accountability, performance management and quality of service provision. Although some
limited reform actions were taken in the past few years through restructuring, corporatization, and privatization of
state-owned enterprises on a case by case basis, there is a need to develop a comprehensive approach to target the
entire non-private enterprise sector.
The numerous fiscal, operational and competitive challenges of a large enterprise sector remaining in public hands
have prompted the Government to request World Bank assistance. The Bank proposes to help the authorities
through the reform of the remaining non-private enterprises to ensure that the role of the state is optimized and that
the performance of the assets in public hands is maximized, reducing fiscal burden and maximizing revenues. The
new DPL series proposed in this CPS would focus on:
- improving the performances and accountability of the management of large state state-owned enterprises by
enhancing corporate governance, improving transparency in performance setting and monitoring and separating
management appointment from the political cycle. This would include introducing a transparent mechanism for
allocating government subsidies compatible with the new Law on State Aid;
- developing a systematic, irreversible time-bound process to complete the resolution of socially-owned enterprises
and of the key non-core state-owned enterprises (i.e. pharmaceutical producers, mining, etc.);
- introducing performance monitoring tools for local utilities and enhancing the role of the private sector to co-invest
in infrastructure via an appropriate legal framework PPP;
- addressing with social safety net and active labor market programs the social issues potentially arising from labor
redundancies associated with performance improvements and privatization of state enterprises.
This programmatic DPL series would pick up on the DPLs and Policy Based Guarantee carried out under the FY08FY11 CPS, which focused on enhancing the business environment, strengthening financial discipline, and building a
more efficient and stable financial sector.



Through its regional Investment Climate advisory program, IFC will support the country’s
efforts in two areas: (i) reducing time and cost of international trade, and (ii) tax simplification
and decreasing costs of compliance and alignment with EU and OECD guidelines and
regulations. Reforms in tax and trade will decrease compliance costs and increase alignment with
EU and OECD guidelines and regulations. IFC will explore options to deepen its advisory work
in the agribusiness sector and increase competitiveness and investment.



In addition, IFC will support corporate governance improvement through implementing
company-level interventions and raising awareness of the importance of corporate governance.



Further, IFC will aim to contribute to improved governance through its work on public-private
partnerships (PPP) and setting industry standards in environmental and social practices.
Box 8: Building a Platform for Sustainable Investment Climate Reforms

IFC assisted the national and 10 local governments in establishing a regulatory governance platform, which is based
on tools following EU and OECD models. By linking the reform efforts of the national and local governments, IFC
contributed to the streamlining of 1,992 legal acts at the national level and 1,143 administrative procedures at the
local level. IFC contributed to the reduction of administrative burdens on the private sector by US$136 million per
year (direct and indirect costs). Following a series of reforms, the governments and other major stakeholders have
committed to implement sustainable regulatory governance tools. At the national level, most significant is the
creation of the Office for Regulatory Reform and Regulatory Impact Assessment within the Government. To scale
up and sustain sub-national regulatory reform, a partnership was established between IFC and the Standing
Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia under which the organization will train and provide regulatory
reform services to more municipalities.
The Alternative Dispute Resolution (the “ADR”) Construction Project in Serbia was a pilot project for IFC,
designed to assess dispute resolution in one sector, following the overall success of establishment and
implementation of commercial mediation system during the first phase (2005-2009). A group of engineers was
trained as mediators to mediate construction disputes. In cooperation with International Federation of Consulting
Engineers (the “FIDIC”) IFC also facilitated the official translation of the FIDIC’s harmonized Red Book (MDB)
and the FIDIC Guide to Practice, encouraging inclusion of FIDIC mediation clauses in new construction contracts.
IFC also supported the Ministry of Justice in drafting the new Law on Mediation that will provide for implementing
a better mediation system. The IFC ADR Construction project established the national legal framework and the
contractual basis for commercial mediation, while establishing sector-specific mediation capacity in Serbia.



CPS Outcome: Improved innovation capacity. The Bank and Serbia’s development partners are
providing complementary and well coordinated support in this area, including with a regional
perspective.
(i)

Serbian Innovation Fund: The Innovation TF financed by the EC supports the capacity
building of the newly established Innovation Fund of Serbia, matching grant programs
for the earliest stages of development in technology-intensive start ups, and will pilot a
technical assistance program tailored to the needs of select research and development
institutes in Serbia to promote technology transfer and commercialization.

(ii)

Western Balkans TA on Science and Innovation: The Bank and the EU signed an
agreement to implement a technical assistance program for the development of a
Regional Research and Development Strategy for Innovation in the Western Balkans.
The strategy will identify priorities in legal requirements, infrastructure, education and
training to be implemented by the beneficiary entities. The TA is financed by the EC
(DG-Enlargement) through a Multi-Country IPA Assistance Project in the amount of
US$2 million. The TA is focusing on (i) how to increase the economic impact of R&D in
the Western Balkans; and (ii) how to integrate education, research and innovation. This

34

analysis will form the basis of a report designed to inform research policies and promote
integration of the region into the European Research Area (ERA).
(iii)

Regional Study on Employment and Innovation: The Employment Through Skills
Trust Fund, financed by the Government of Austria, will support survey analysis of the
existing skills mix in selected countries, including Serbia, and compare this inventory to
similar benchmark analysis in selected OECD countries. The results of this project will
be disseminated at an international conference.
II: Improved Efficiency and Outcomes in Social Spending

CPS Outcome: Strengthened fiscal performance with sustained improvement in human development
outcomes through more efficient, effective social spending. Serbia faces twin challenges of meeting the
growing social needs resulting from the economic and financial crisis within tight fiscal constraints. The
Government recognizes the need to get more social impact per dinar invested in its social programs.
Moreover, the EC is increasingly concerned with its ability to monitor the impact of its support to Serbia,
particularly in the social sectors. In this context (as noted above) it is working with the Bank to develop
an IPA funded regional Trust Fund to strengthen national level capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) of Strategy Implementation. The Bank expects to work closely with Serbia, based on the
recently completed Public Expenditure Review and planned PSIAs, to identify areas for efficiency gains
while improving the reach and effectiveness of social spending.


The proposed third operation in the Public Expenditure DPL programmatic series will build on
the previous two operations which have supported the Government’s efforts to restrain growth in
public sector wages and pension obligations, while improving public expenditure management.
The objective of the PEDPL 3 is to reduce the size of Serbia’s large public sector and support
reforms that will improve the efficiency of public spending while mitigating the persistent social
impact of the economic crisis. It is designed to (i) increase the efficiency of expenditure in the
health and education spending; (ii) strengthen public expenditure and debt management; and (iii)
strengthen social assistance to cushion the impact of the economic crisis and expand coverage of
social assistance programs. As part of the operation, the Bank would carry out a PSIA Review to
look at the results of reforms to student financing and school and class rationalization, to assess
the effects on geographic coverage (in particular with respect to cuts in areas where more
marginalized groups live) and the impact of those who stand to lose their jobs.



The Bank will continue to support increased access, efficiency, and quality of local health,
education, and social protection services through the Delivery of Improved Local Services
(DILS) project. Expected outcomes in the education sector include testing central and local per
capita funding formulas; in social protection the project will improve the framework in the
Ministry of Labor for utilization of State disability funds in addressing disabled people's needs
and the social assistance registry; and in health increase the number of Roma children vaccinated
through Roma health mediators supported by the Ministry of Health, as well as the number of
accredited Primary health clinics. The Public Expenditure DPL series also supports policy
reforms in the health sector, specifically the introduction of performance-based payments.



Key to both CPS pillars is a more cost efficient and effective education system: The EC notes in
its 2011 Progress Report that the “ongoing skills mismatch continues to act as a drag on the
development of new segments of the economy and requires further reforms of the education and
training system that would respond better to labor market demand”. Ongoing Education TA will
contribute to increased capacity in planning and monitoring of education spending, as well as an
improved institutional framework for monitoring of outcomes in pre-university education.

35



The Government has taken steps to reign in pension spending, but its pension reform agenda
remains unfinished, leaving unsustainable pension deficits. The challenge will grow more acute
given Serbia’s aging population. The Consolidated Collection and Pension project will reduce
the administrative costs associated with the pensions system, reduce the reporting burden of
employers, and help bring down the total cost of the pension system as a percentage of GDP.

CPS Outcome: More informed and effective policymaking to reduce poverty and increase social
inclusion. Serbia’s recovery—and its efforts to reduce poverty to at least pre-crisis levels—will be held
back unless it addresses some key challenges.

23
24



The Bank is looking carefully at who has been hurt by the crisis and its continuing aftermath, and
what obstacles they face in finding employment. The Western Balkans Poverty Assessment
will support evidence based policy making through the timely provision of poverty analysis,
collaboration with local stakeholders to strengthen analytical and statistical capacity, and the indepth analysis of topical issues, particularly the distributional consequences of policy reforms.
This programmatic ESW will seek to monitor poverty, inequality and labor market trends;
continue providing analytical and statistical support to government counterparts; and provide
analytical work on emerging policy issues. An important task under this project during the new
CPS period will be to support the Statistical Office through the Social Inclusion and Living
Conditions (SILC) survey using National IPA funds. As the survey is the main tool adopted in
EU Member States to monitor progress towards the poverty and inclusion targets in the Europe
2020 strategy, this activity is an important element of the coordination of efforts in strengthening
the analytical capacity of local stakeholders for evidence based policy making in the field of
inclusion that we are developing with DG EMPL. The Western Balkans regional AAA on
Smart Safety Nets and Activation will advise on how to make the social assistance system
incentive-compatible, flexible and pro-active, and how to coordinate social cash transfers with the
provision of employment and social care services.



IFC will continue its efforts to address poverty and lack of access in the frontier regions in Serbia
through its direct financing to companies operating in these regions, including in the agribusiness
sector, as well as through providing credit lines to the banks.



Women face particular challenges in the labor market. Designing projects and reforms that
support gender equality requires identifying the barriers that prevent women’s participation. The
Bank has invested significantly in the Western Balkans in both gender and poverty analysis. The
recent dissemination of a report on the gender impact of the crisis23 has been an opportunity to
open a new forum for dialogue on gender issues with UNWomen24 and other donors as well as
academic and independent researchers on the analytical agenda on gender in the country. In
addition, an initial portfolio gender review has been conducted, and during the CPS period,
thematic reviews of how to mainstream gender in existing and future projects, to be conducted
under the Western Balkans Programmatic Gender Monitoring, will identify how to increase
the gender inclusiveness of the existing portfolio and inform the design of future lending
operations. One example is the DILS project, which will introduce incentives for cervical
screening in primary health care. This has led to a broader discussion with the authorities about a
future health project which would include monitorable targets for improving women’s health.
IFC will also explore ways to improve financial intermediation to SMEs, especially to womenowned businesses as a vital part of Serbia’s economy.

The Financial Crisis, Labor Market Transitions and Earnings: a gendered analysis, forthcoming
The event was an opportunity for launching a new closer collaboration with UNWomen, whose experience and
practical involvement on the ground in policy dialogue and projects on gender empowerment can help us
increase the relevance of the new Western Balkans Programmatic Gender Monitoring activity.
36

Box 9: Western Balkans Programmatic Gender Monitoring
As background for the CPS preparation, the country team has undertaken a Gender Portfolio Review for Serbia
based on a methodology developed by the LAC region. The objective of the review is to identify how to
mainstream gender into the existing Bank portfolio. This activity is a pilot in the region and was designed as a
learning experience whose lessons will be shared more broadly across the Region. The emerging findings for Serbia
will be addressed more systematically under the new Western Balkans Programmatic Gender Monitoring
activity, which is just starting. Out of the existing portfolio, six projects were selected for the portfolio review.
Three were selected as their closing dates in FY13 offer the greatest opportunity to mainstream gender. Three of the
projects in the portfolio due to close in FY12 were chosen to capture the spectrum of challenges and existing
experiences in streamlining gender. They include the health project to capture a more “mature” and relatively self
evident sector to mainstream gender; the land administration project to identify one sector in which the Bank has
significant knowledge on how to mainstream gender; and the energy project where the potential for mainstreaming
gender is much more difficult to assess and best practices are harder to come by.
The portfolio review is based on project-related information from PADs and supplemental project documents if
available. The information is analyzed along three dimensions25 to assess:
(i) Whether the project was informed by gender analysis and consultations as part of the social assessment. This also
includes discussing whether addressing gender disparities should have been included in the project objective.
(ii) Whether the project included gender-responsive design and targeting. Gender-responsive design indicates that
infrastructure, services, institutions, or policies accounted for different needs of men and women. This may lead to
identify the need for new institutional arrangements or partnerships to mainstream gender in the sector. The issue of
targeting of beneficiaries is also explored in detail looking for example at whether, if women were part of the social
assessment, there was any follow-up on targeting women as beneficiaries, whether there are social norms to be
considered in the targeting process, whether there particular concerns for female headed households due to conflict,
displacement, migration that require special consideration etc.
(iii) Whether the project included gender-responsive Monitoring and Evaluation. This part of the analysis is based
on a review of project indicators. The potential for including gender sensitive indicators is also explored.
Results from this Review are coming in and will be reviewed to identify whether follow up analysis and data
collection (e.g. through focus groups of beneficiaries) might be required.
Initial findings confirm there is scope for significant improvement in mainstreaming gender into projects. While
three of the 6 projects appear to have focused on gender in the social assessment, most projects did not specifically
have components targeting women and their needs and result frameworks were also not designed with gender
disaggregated indicators in mind

Environmental Sustainability
98.
As noted above, while not a pillar of the CPS, Bank supported projects are also helping to
advance Serbia’s environmental agenda.


The Bor Regional Development Project is supporting the Government’s efforts to assist this
large but underserved population in what was once a thriving industrial center with creating
employment opportunities and economic diversification. The majority of funding has been
allocated for the cleanup and remediation of large areas with mining waste disposal sites
remaining from historic mining operations. The Bor region’s economy is based primarily on a
large state owned copper mine, which, now at far lower levels of production, has left behind a
challenging ecological legacy.

The ongoing Energy Efficiency project will result in significant energy savings of retrofitted
schools and hospitals, including carbon emissions reductions of 42 percent on average for
hospitals. Other outcomes will be improvement in air quality through the reduction of emissions
at the Clinical Center; and financial savings for the Ministry of Health. IFC’s efforts in the area
of climate change are important in its strategy in Western Balkans. In Serbia, IFC will continue to
focus on climate change using its regional energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.
The CPS Financing Program

99.
A significant share of IBRD financing during FY12-FY15 will come from ongoing
operations approved during the previous CPS. Total remaining disbursements of the active portfolio
are expected to amount to some US$550 million.
100.
IBRD financing during the first two years of the CPS is expected to amount to US$340
million. The Government has asked for lending during the entire CPS period of US$800 million. The
Bank is sensitive to the challenging external environment for Serbia (and the rest of the Western
Balkans), as well as the importance of supporting the country during this critical period as it prepares for
EU accession. Management has indicated the Bank will be as responsive as possible to meet the
Government's borrowing needs. Final lending amounts will depend on IBRDs lending capacity and
demand from other borrowers as well as performance during the course of CPS implementation. The
lending program for the last two years of the CPS will be discussed at the time of an early CPS Progress
Report.
101.
IFC expects to provide financing of US$600-800 million to the private sector during the
CPS period. The program will depend on the government’s support for private sector participation in the
infrastructure sector at national and municipal levels, further improvements in the business environment,
and the growth outlook in Europe. IFC’s activities will focus on creating opportunities for growth
through supporting competitive sectors, deepening investment climate work, strengthening domestic
financial markets, and facilitating private sector participation in infrastructure.

VI. RISKS
102.
The chief risk to successful completion of this CPS would result from Serbia failing to
consolidate hard won progress toward macroeconomic stability. This would be particularly damaging
given what is likely to remain serious volatility in Serbia’s main export markets in the eurozone, as it
would likely undermine Serbia’s economic recovery and lead to increased levels of poverty and
unemployment. To help mitigate this risk, the CPS program includes a DPL operation designed to reduce
the size of Serbia’s large public sector while maintaining the quality of core public services and a new
DPL series aimed at reducing the role of the State in the market by resolving the status of non-private
enterprises. The CPS’ emphasis on removing some of the bottlenecks to competitiveness and
productivity can also help mitigate the risk of a sharp slowdown. The Stand-by Arrangement with the
IMF will also be central in this regard. Finally, the current Government’s track record of successful
implementation of Fund Programs and Bank supported DPLs provides important context in which to
consider this risk. As noted above, the recognition by all major parties that difficult steps toward EU
accession and continued fiscal discipline will be required going forward also help reduce vulnerability.
103.
The second and related risk is a weakening of commitment to policy reform as a result of
the elections. This would slow progress toward EU accession and disrupt advancement of the Bank’s
programmatic DPL series. Again, the consensus behind, and the overwhelming economic and financial
incentives to remain on track for, EU accession will help sustain the country’s focus on policy reform.
The emphasis of the CPS on supporting this progress will also help in key sectors.
104.
Third, implementation risks are significant. The public institutions responsible for the reforms
central to the DPL series and to executing Bank financed investment operations need strengthening.
Failure to accelerate implementation of investment lending could lead the Bank to cancel or postpone
projected operations in key areas. The Bank is working closely with the authorities on new approaches to
portfolio management, and will continue to consolidate the portfolio, including through cancellation and
restructuring of slow disbursing projects, to ensure more efficient and timely implementation.

Issues and Obstacles
The role of the state in the corporate sector
remains pervasive, with fiscal implications in the
form of direct and indirect subsidies and
consequences for growth and competitiveness:
(i) Large state owned enterprises (SOEs) have
largely remained under government control, with
poor governance and performance.
(ii) Socially owned enterprises, employing a
significant share of the workforce, also remain
unresolved.
(iii) Municipal utilities present heterogeneous
performance and are affected by lack of

there is a need to develop a comprehensive
approach targeting the entire non-private
enterprise sector to improve its governance and

Annex 2: Completion Report

SERBIA: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY08 – FY11
COMPLETION REPORT
1.
This report is a self-evaluation by the World Bank of the experience in implementing the
Republic of Serbia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering the period from FY08 to FY11.
The main objectives of the report are threefold:
i) examine the performance of the CPS program and progress towards achieving country goals;
ii) assess the performance of the World Bank in delivering the CPS program; and
iii) derive lessons from the implementation of the CPS program that will be taken into
consideration for the design and implementation of the new CPS for the period FY12 - FY15.

I.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

2.
Overall, CPS program performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory: the CPS was
well aligned with Serbian national development goals and addressed key developmental priorities,
but implementation was affected by unforeseeable internal and external factors. The CPS was –
appropriately -- designed within the framework of Serbia’s strategy for integration with the EU, a
widely-shared goal among Serbian political parties as well as the general public. CPS interventions
were focused on areas where the Bank could add value by virtue of its international and regional
knowledge or past experience in Serbia itself. However, while some aspects of the CPS program
were extremely successful (inter alia, the DPL program, real estate cadastre and energy efficiency
interventions), it was affected in a number of cases by a set of challenging internal political
developments which arose at the beginning of the CPS period, in turn, leading to implementation
delays. In the first instance, new presidential elections, the declaration of independence by Kosovo
(formerly a part of Serbia), and parliamentary elections led to widespread political uncertainty for an
extended period and contributed to an 18-month delay in the ratification by parliament of five Bank
operations approved at the end of the previous CPS period, which were key to the achievement of
some CPS outcomes. The same political factors also distracted decision-makers’ attention from the
implementation of projects already in the portfolio, thereby delaying the achievement of results in
some instances. Moreover, the formation of the government by a complex coalition comprised of 13
political parties frequently affected project implementation, most prominently in cases (such as the
Corridor X project) where it was necessary to reach agreements among government institutions
headed by officials representing different coalition partners with divergent philosophies.

45

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

3.
The impact of the global crisis in 2008-2009 also led to some setbacks and caused the
Government to turn its attention to emerging challenges and reorder some priorities, although the
overall goals and direction of reforms remained unchanged. Serbia suffered a deep recession
characterized by a 3.1 percent decline in GDP in 2009 and sharp drops in private investment,
consumption and public revenues. Policy-makers’ attention thus understandably shifted to
stabilization of the economy, principally through negotiating a Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF.
It also turned to the Bank for assistance with related structural reforms including public expenditure
management, further business climate enhancements and financial sector strengthening (including
crisis management). The Bank responded through a combination of new DPL lending and analytical
work for fiscal management-- undertaken in close partnerships with the EC, EBRD, EIB and the IMF
-- which was additional to the original CPS program.
4.
Despite the unforeseen developments affecting CPS outcomes in some instances and the
CPS program itself in others, the overall program is judged to have achieved moderate success
across each of the three pillars identified in the CPS and CPS Progress Report. While most
expected outcomes were only partially achieved, there was good progress with regard to several key
reform areas – notably, restructuring and privatization of socially-owned enterprises, energy
efficiency, cadastre/property registration, financial sector strengthening, capital markets development
and debt management, budget administration, pension system sustainability, and the reduction of
pollution flows to the Danube. On the other hand, the reform process faced significant obstacles over
the CPS period in some important areas such as energy sector reform, remediation of environmental
hazards in the Bor region, and the development of irrigation and drainage schemes (due to a four year
delay in the adoption of the underlying framework Water Law). Additionally, although works began
on the economically important Corridor X highway there have been some implementation delays.
Nonetheless, given that end-results were only planned to be achieved in the next CPS cycle, and most
implementation problems have been resolved, it is likely that project outcomes will materialize with
only a relatively short delay.
5.
The World Bank’s performance in delivering the CPS program is assessed as satisfactory.
Especially noteworthy was the Bank’s quick response to Serbian requests in the face of the global
crisis and the flexibility that it demonstrated in adjusting lending, including increasing the original
CPS allocation of US$600 million by US$300 million in November 2009. About half of the total
(revised) CPS allocation of US$900 million was directed towards budget support through two series
of development policy operations (DPOs) in order to support reforms in privatization and the
financial sector, as well as to strengthen public expenditure management. The sizeable Policy Based
Guarantee operation ($400 million) undertaken within the Privatization and Financial DPL series
also helped boost market confidence in Serbia during a critical period. During FYs09 and10 the
Bank approved three investment operations in social services, health and roads, totaling about
US$448 million – all important priorities in Serbia’s development agenda. More recently, the Board
approved a $5 million loan to support Serbia’s participation in the regional Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility, which should help protect individuals and businesses as well as reduce fiscal
pressures arising from natural disasters.

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

6.
IFC first focused its support in two major areas: (i) facilitating restructuring and
ownership change in the enterprise sector; and (ii) helping Serbia to improve its competitiveness.
In the CPS Progress Report, IFC has reprioritized its short-term objectives. The global financial crisis
led to a shift to the banking sector with a focus on supporting the systemic banks to survive the crisis.
Also, through its investments and advisory services to selected Serbian banks, IFC assisted critical
and most vulnerable segments of the economy such as micro, small and medium size enterprises and
agriculture sector. In the real sector, IFC focused on supporting its existing portfolio clients, low-cost
producers and regional market leaders helping them survive through the crisis and when possible
expand their operations. IFC supported 11 projects investing US$455 million (US$351 million its
own account and US$104 million through mobilization) including about US$209 million in the
financial sector and over US$246 million in the real sector.

7.

Key lessons and recommendations for the new CPS can be summarized as follows:


The emphasis on reform areas associated with EU Integration should be maintained,
given the wide political and popular consensus on the EU perspective for Serbia



DPLs underpinned by high quality analytical work are an important tool in effecting
change in the Serbian context, including by helping to define a comprehensive reform
program and to maintain the commitment of diverse actors



Investment operations are most successful when relatively narrowly focused on a few
related objectives and when primary responsibility for implementation rests with a single
agency



Institutional arrangements and implementing agencies’ commitment to project activities
should be carefully considered during preparation; additionally, attention should be paid
to the availability of adequate dedicated staff resources on both the Government’s and
Bank’s sides to carry out implementation activities in a timely way



Steady consolidation of the portfolio with a focus on fewer, larger projects is likely to
help maintain focus and ensure attention from high-level officials; strengthening the
Ministry of Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-à-vis the implementing
agencies could also improve portfolio performance



Close coordination with the EC, other International Financial Institutions (IMF, EBRD,
EIB), and bilateral partners is vital to maintaining the momentum of the reform agenda
and reducing strain on limited capacity



The Results Framework, and monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened in the
next CPS and careful attention should be paid to the availability of appropriate
instruments to support the achievement of stated outcomes

II.

PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COUNTRY GOALS

8.
The strategic setting for reforms in Serbia is defined in large measure by the country’s
goal of achieving integration with the EU. The 2008 National Plan for Integration (NPI) is the core
strategic document that defines Serbia’s agenda for achievement of integration with the EU – the
country’s overarching development objective -- and clearly lays out the key priorities for the
harmonization of Serbia’s institutional and legal framework with EU requirements. In December
2010, the Government also adopted an action plan aimed at gaining EU candidate status by end2011. Some progress towards the goal of EU integration was apparent during the CPS period. In
late 2010 the EU Council decided to forward Serbia's application for EU candidacy to the EC for an
opinion and provided the Serbian Government with its questionnaire -- responses to which will form
the basis for an assessment by the EU on Serbia’s readiness for integration into the EU. Shortly
thereafter, in January 2011, the European Parliament ratified the SAA (Stabilization and Association
Agreement) with Serbia.
9.
The Bank Group’s strategy for this CPS period was fully consistent with the Serbian
Government’s development strategy as set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), EU
integration strategy, and the 2008 Budget. The Government’s strategy laid out the key aims of: (i)
maintaining macro-economic stability, (ii) promoting dynamic private sector led growth through
accelerated economic reform, and (iii) increasing employment and living standards and encouraging
more balanced regional development. The CPS program seeks to further each of these goals directly
through Pillars I and II, aimed at promoting private sector-led growth and broadening opportunities
on both an individual and household basis. Its third pillar, aimed at better management of
environmental and disaster risks, is also recognized as a key component of sustainably accelerating
growth and reducing risks to in households and businesses.
10.
Despite the financial crisis, the government maintained macro-economic stability, thanks
to the adoption of appropriate fiscal and monetary policy and structural reforms in the financial
and public sectors. As in other Central and Eastern European countries, Serbia’s public revenues
suffered a sharp blow as a result of the global crisis. General government revenues in 2009 declined
by 9 percent in real terms compared to 2008, causing the fiscal deficit to jump from 2.6 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 4.3 and 4.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010 respectively, despite severe spending
cuts. The authorities responded with a fiscal adjustment package, supported by the IMF through a
new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and the Bank through its ongoing macro dialogue in the context
of the PE and PF DPL series and new analytical work aimed at containing expenditures (Doing More
With Less FY09). A large and balanced fiscal adjustment package formed the core of the reform
program and aimed to contain the deficit to sustainable levels through a number of bold measures,
including, notably, a freeze on wages and pensions in nominal terms and outright cuts in subsidies
and capital expenditures. In addition, Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL) enacted in December
2010, set the medium-term deficit target at 1 percent of GDP, and outlined wage and pension
indexation formulae up to 2015. The FRL also set numerical targets for the deficit for the medium
term, and placed a cap on public debt (currently 45% of GDP). To stabilize the financial system, the
48

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

Government and the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) -- in close cooperation with the banking
community, the Bank, other IFIs, and the EU -- mounted a coordinated response, which resulted in
strengthened deposits. Deposits now stand at over €6.2 billion, exceeding their pre-crisis levels.
11.
There were also notable improvements, albeit slow, in public financial management during
the CPS period. In 2009, the Treasury instituted a modern, integrated information system
incorporating a single chart of accounts used by all cost centers and now controls payments through a
single account in the National Bank of Serbia. The organic Budget Systems Law was refined in 2009
and 2010 to incorporate improvements in budgeting, accounting, financial control, internal auditing,
debt management and fiscal responsibility and many of these changes are now under implementation.
The Public Procurement Law has also been updated but considerable work is still needed on by-laws
+and administration as well as on strengthening of institutional capacity for procurement. The State
Audit Institution performed its first audit of the final accounts for the Republic of Serbia for 2008
with only limited success but has since improved its performance as evidenced by the completion of
a more comprehensive and thorough audit of 2009 final accounts. Work on 2010 accounts is now
ongoing. A step forward was made towards the use of country systems in the area of financial
management, since an assessment conducted in 2010 concluded that the Treasury system and the
National Bank as the agent are sufficiently effective and reliable to be used for flow of funds on the
World Bank supported project. The practical move towards this shift is envisaged in the short term.
12.
Although growth was negatively affected by the global financial crisis, the government
achieved satisfactory progress with respect to improving the business environment and reforming
the enterprise sector. The rapid pre-crisis growth of the Serbian economy (5% per year during 20012008) was followed by a sharp recession in 2009 (GDP decreased by 3.5%) in the wake of the global
financial and economic crisis. However, 2010 data indicate that GDP growth rebounded to 1.8
percent, suggesting that a private sector-led economic recovery is gaining momentum. This relatively
quick rebound is at least partially related to the actions taken by the Government over 2008-2010 to
improve the business environment. Key measures adopted include the following: (i) establishment of
a one-stop shop for business registration to simplify business entry; (ii) adoption of a new Law on
Business Entities to strengthen corporate governance; (iii) improvement of the legal and institutional
framework for competition through adoption in 2009 of a new Competition law; and (iv) passage of a
new Enforcement Law, thereby significantly improving the effectiveness of contract enforcement.
Further, a comprehensive regulatory review was completed on the basis of which the government
adopted 304 recommendations to amend laws and regulations and eliminate 192 unnecessary
regulations with the aim of reducing the regulatory burden on business. Implementation is underway.
Finally, the government is conducting regulatory impact analysis of new laws affecting business.
13.
Government also remained committed to improving transport and trade logistics, despite
the severe fiscal pressures deriving from the impact of the global crisis. For example, in order to
complete the missing links on a crucial highway, Corridor 10, the Government sought and obtained
financing of €1.58 billion, including US$388 million from the Bank. Finally, it should be noted that
there was considerable progress on the privatization agenda during the CPS period. A controlling
49

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

stake in one of the largest state-owned enterprises, the Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS - state oil
company) was sold, and two other large enterprises, the state telecoms company and Galenika, a
state-owned pharmaceutical company, were offered for sale. The government also moved forward
rapidly on its commitment to restructuring and privatize the entire portfolio of socially-owned
enterprises, leading to the privatization or other resolution of about 600 enterprises, despite setbacks
resulting from the 2009 drop in economic activity.
14.
Significant improvements were achieved with regard to building a more stable, efficient
and resilient financial sector. The Parliament enacted amendments to the Law on Banks, the Law on
Bankruptcy and Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, the Law on Deposit Insurance, and
the Law on Deposit Insurance Agency. Additionally, the Government approved new amendments to
the Law on Insurance with provisions which will result in converting the ownership of Dunav – a
very large insurance company with market share of 28 percent -- from social to state, and mandate
the commencement of Dunav’s privatization by 2013.
15.
Although neither employment nor living standards increased over the CPS period, there
was a strong push for fundamental reform of social assistance and pensions, as well as important
changes in the health and education sectors. The deceleration of economic growth that resulted
from the global crisis and recession led to an upsurge in poverty. Poverty increased from 6.1 in 2008
to 6.9 percent in 2009, and further, to 9.2 percent in 2010, equivalent to a total of 220 thousand
people sliding into poverty during the two crisis years, according to the Household Budget Survey
(HBS). Growing unemployment (from already high levels) has been an important transmission
channel; unemployment reached 20.0 percent in October 2010. However, the government ensured
that social safety nets programs for the poor and vulnerable were protected from the fiscal spending
cuts necessitated by the crisis. Furthermore, the newly- adopted Social Assistance Law contributed to
scaling up of the MOP (Material Support for Low Income Households program) and laid the ground
for improving the effectiveness and impact of social assistance by linking ‘passive’ cash transfers
with social care, employment and activation services, and putting employment integration at the very
heart of social policy. Some tough decisions were also taken to ensure the fiscal sustainability of the
pension system. These included a freeze on pensions in 2009 and 2010, and the enactment of
amendments to the Pension Law, which, on the one hand, decreased the number of benefits per
pensioner, and, on the other, increased the minimum pension to better protect the most vulnerable
elderly groups. Reforms in the health and education sectors had the impact of increasing health and
education coverage at the local level, rationalizing the schools network, and laying the groundwork
for implementation of capitation-based financing for health.

III. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
16.
The CPS was designed in a flexible way to maintain targeted, timely, and responsive
assistance to support Serbia’s transition to the EU and allowed for course adjustments to respond
to emerging needs (e.g. the global crisis). The main objectives of the CPS were three-fold, all fully
50

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

aligned with government priorities: (i) encouraging private sector led growth and EU convergence;
(ii) providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth; and (iii) managing environmental
and disaster risks.
17.
Serbia’s rapidly changing political environment affected CPS implementation. On January
20, 2008, two months after the World Bank Executive Board discussed the CPS, Serbia held first
round presidential elections. In February 2008, President Boris Tadic from the pro-European Union
(EU) Democratic Party won a majority. Two weeks after the presidential elections, Kosovo declared
independence, leading to the dissolution of Parliament and the scheduling of new parliamentary
elections for May 2008. On May 11, buoyed by broad domestic support for EU membership,
President Tadic’s Democratic Party scored a significant victory but fell short of an outright majority,
in turn. The President subsequently reached out to smaller parties (including the Socialist Party), and
assembled a pro-reform governing coalition by June. This resulted in substantial delays in the
ratification by Parliament of Bank projects, particularly five operations that had been approved by the
Board towards the end of the previous CPS period. As already explained, as a result of widespread
political uncertainty, these operations--Bor Regional Development Project, Transitional Agriculture
Reform Project, Additional Financing for Transport Rehabilitation Project, Additional Financing

Priority I: Encouraging private sector led growth and EU convergence
Rationalizing SOEs
19.
Despite the impact of the economic slowdown which caused some setbacks, positive results
were achieved with respect to the liquidation, restructuring and privatization of Socially-Owned
Enterprises (ScOEs) and (generally larger) State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) over the CPS period.
Government, supported by the Bank’s PFDPL program and related analytical work, placed high
52

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

priority on the divestiture of its extensive portfolio of some 1,000 ScOEs. Specifically, legislation
was passed requiring completion of the ScOE privatization process before end-2008, by mandating
that companies for which privatization had not started would automatically be closed. Consequently,
over 2008-2009, 430 were sold for about €362 million, and 162 ScOEs were sent to bankruptcy in
2010. As a result, by the end of 2008, virtually all of the country’s ScOEs had been readied for
privatization or publicly offered. Unfortunately, however, the timing of the latter stages of this
process coincided with the onset of the global financial crisis, depressing the uptake by the private
sector of the tenders. Moreover, throughout 2009, many previously-awarded privatization contracts
(about 91) had to be cancelled since private investors, hurt by the global recession, failed to fulfill
their contractual obligations. Most of these ScOEs were returned to the Privatization Agency’s
portfolio – and converted to SOEs in accordance with the law -- in order to undergo a new resolution
process. Nonetheless, the privatization/resolution of ScOEs continued since 2007 leaving the
Privatization Agency with a substantially reduced portfolio of about 450 ScOEs and SOEs in early
2011 (excluding 193 for which privatization contracts had to be cancelled). The Government also
began the process of corporatizing SOEs with aim of eventually privatizing selected enterprises (e.g.,
the national airline, the state telecoms company and several others) during the CPS period. Thus far,
a 51 percent stake in the state oil company has been sold to a foreign investor and steps have been
taken to ready the telecoms company and a state-owned pharmaceutical company for eventual sale.
In addition, the Government is moving forward with a plan to carve out the good assets of the
national airline and transfer them to a new company that it will offer for sale.
20.
Partly as a result of the steps taken to liquidate or privatize ScOEs and SOEs, the
government was able to make some headway in its effort to reduce the level of state budget
subsidies to SOEs and ScOEs. Subsidies from the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development
to state- and socially-owned enterprises, which stood at 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007, had declined to
0.8 percent of GDP by 2010, freeing up resources for other priority expenses. Subsidies to ScOE’s
amount to only about 15 percent of the total subsidies provided, reflecting the superior progress made
in the resolution and privatization of these businesses vis a vis SOE restructuring/privatization.

21.
The CPS program also helped introduce a new model of funding for Research and
Development (R&D), aimed at strengthening the role of demand in the choice of R&D priorities.
The main change is a shift away from direct financing of R&D Institutes to providing the funding to
companies, which, in turn, can then purchase R&D services from the institutes or other sources. In
addition, improvements were made to a number of laws and other framework documents – e.g., the
Law on Innovation, the Law on Science, and the Innovation Strategy -- in order to promote greater
innovation in Serbia. Moreover, with support from the Bank, the government is designing a program
of institutional capacity building for the Serbia Innovation Fund (SIF), piloting financial instruments
to stimulate innovative activity in enterprises, and piloting reforms in the research and development
institute (RDI) sector. The program is funded via the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA).

22.
Overall, Serbia has made substantial progress in reducing red tape for businesses and
creating a business friendly environment, although some areas continue to lag. With the
establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration within the Serbian Business Registration
Agency, the process of registering a business was significantly simplified, resulting in a reduction of
the time required to register a company to a maximum of 5 days by 2010. Furthermore, significant
progress was recorded with respect to reducing the overall regulatory compliance burden. For
example, the number of procedures needed to start a business was reduced from 11 to 7 procedures,
and the time needed dropped from 23 to 13 days (DBRs 2008 and 2011). Similarly, the cost of
registering property halved from 5.4 percent of the property value to 2.7 percent. The Bank
supported Government’s efforts to create a more business friendly environment, in part through the
conduct of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), of new regulations affecting businesses. In parallel,
the Government embarked on an ambitious comprehensive regulatory review exercise and has
already started implementing key recommendations. By end-2010 some 79 (of 304)
recommendations to amend regulations and procedures had been implemented and 192 unnecessary
regulations eliminated which are estimated to result in annual cost savings to businesses of around
€50.8 million. Finally, it is worth noting that Government has recently taken a decision to create a
permanent institutional framework for RIA. The Bank has played a significant role in supporting the
Government's efforts to reduce the overall regulatory burden compliance and to improve the business
environment through a SIDA TF and the PFDPL2, and continues to support further improvements
through an IDF grant. However, some processes, e.g., obtaining a construction permit, still need
improvement. According to DBR 2011 it still requires 20 procedures and 279 days to obtain a
construction permit, although the cost decreased.
23.
IFC supported this agenda through completion of the first phase of the regulatory
guillotine review at sub-national level to improve the business environment and sub-national
competitiveness in four municipalities. In addition, IFC has provided advisory services to 30
companies through its Supplier Development Program, as part of the Serbia Investment Promotion
Program. At sub-national level, IFC assisted 10 localities (with 0.7 million people, or 10% of the
total population) to improve, simplify, or eliminate some administrative procedures. As a result,
more than 98% of business related administrative procedures were abrogated or improved. More
specifically, in the construction sector, as a result of the adoption of Planning and Construction law
(September 2009), 60 local administrative procedures were improved or eliminated with an estimated
annual savings of US$ 100 million to the private companies.
24.
IFC enhanced corporate governance practices through implementing company-level
interventions and strengthening knowledge and awareness on the importance of corporate
governance at the corporate and institutional levels. IFC advised 18 local companies on how to
improve their corporate governance practices. In parallel, IFC assisted with the introduction of the
Corporate Governance Code for listed companies and provided institutional support to the Serbian
Chamber of Commerce and Belgrade Stock Exchange to promote corporate governance among listed
and unlisted companies throughout Serbia. IFC promoted assessment of corporate governance
54

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

practices among banking institutions. As a result of improved corporate governance practices, local
companies were able to raise US$ 72 million in financing.
Strengthening financial sector intermediation
25.
An area of notable progress during the CPS period relates to creation of a more efficient
property market through improvements in both registration and financing. With support from the
Bank-financed Real Estate Cadastre Project (FY04), the Government has designated cadastre
municipalities covering 88 percent of the country’s total physical space. The Real Estate Cadastre
(REC) is currently fully operational in 92 percent of cadastre municipalities (CM), and the remaining
8 percent will be covered by Dec 31, 2011. The process is already well underway in these remaining
municipalities since REC public display has already been initiated, implying that outdated land books
are no longer in use, and only REC can register transaction and issue ownership certificates. The
availability of secure land titles has already had a substantial effect on the use of mortgage backed
financing. In 2007, mortgage financing was provided for only about 5 percent of all property
transactions and that figure had increased more than six fold to 31 percent of all transactions by the
third quarter of 2010. The Bank was instrumental in achieving these positive outcomes through its
support for the Real Estate Cadastre project that was under implementation throughout the CPS
period and is expected to close in October 2011.
26.
The Government also made clear headway in restructuring the financial sector and
strengthening the regulatory regime underlying the banking, insurance, and securities sectors.
Partial success was realized in Government’s effort to fully privatize public financial sector holdings,
although the advent of the global financial crisis in late 2008 caused some setbacks to the original
plans. With support from the FY11 PFSPBG, the Government moved forward with consolidating the
majority state-owned banking sector. Of the four majority state owned banks, Credy Banka was sold
to a private foreign group, Postanska and Privredna Pancevo were merged, and Srpska Banka
remains as is. As a result, the number of majority state-owned banks is currently 2 (versus 4 at the
start of the CPS period). By Q3 of 2010 majority state-owned banks’ share had decreased to 1.9
percent. In addition, the state continues to have minority stakes (20-30 percent) in 5 banks. Efforts to
sell these stakes through the stock market proved unsuccessful in the wake of the economic
slowdown generated by the global financial crisis.
27.
The performance of the insurance sector has improved since 2008 thanks to improved
supervision that led to the exit from the market of loss making insurance companies and the entry
of foreign players. One large state-owned company, DDOR Novi Sad, was sold to the Italian
Fondiaria, which substantially improved the performance of the company. In addition, Dunav, a
state-owned insurance company accounting for 28 percent of the market, has initiated restructuring
measures to improve its performance. However, Dunav’s underwriting performance is still lagging
and some of its policies (e.g., substantial reductions in premium rates in the motor third party liability
business) continue to distort the market. In light of the possible market distortion, the Government
has committed to future privatization of Dunav, which will, inter alia, require transformation of the
company from a social-owned to a state-owned entity. To reduce the potential for systemic risk in the
55

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

sector, the Law on Insurance has already been amended to require the separation of life and non-life
insurance businesses by the end of 2011. Moreover, additional legal amendments to the Law are
underway, that will define the process by which this transformation (from social to state ownership)
can be achieved and commence the privatization of at least 20 percent of state-owned capital in
insurance companies by the end of 2013.
28.
The onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008 prompted the Government to request
the Bank’s assistance in developing and implementing an appropriate crisis management
framework. In response to this request, the Bank undertook both an FY10 FSAP update and FY10
Crisis Preparedness Assessment to ensure an adequate analytical basis for reforms. As a result of the
Crisis Preparedness Assessment and related TA, and supported by the Private and Financial Sector
Policy Based Guarantee (PFPBG) the NBS has supported a stress testing exercise for banks,
strengthened the deposit insurance, and enhanced the bank resolution framework. The Deposit
Insurance Agency now has: (i) access to adequate information to ensure a fast payout; (ii) up-to-date
payout procedures and tested software; and, (iii) swift access to emergency funding sources.
Moreover, a diagnostic methodology was developed through the FSAP update TA, and is being
applied regularly. Based on this methodology, the banking sector as a whole has a capital adequacy
ratio of over 20 percent (September 2010). Serbia, with Bank support, has also successfully put in
place all the legal amendments required to institute an effective, new bank resolution framework.
These measures, and particularly implementation of the activities related to Deposit Insurance and
bank assessment early in the crisis, clearly contributed to halting an incipient run on banks in the
wake of the global crisis, and subsequently, to the actual reversal of deposit outflows.
29.
The Bank also supported capital markets development and debt management over the
period of this CPS. The government established a Public Debt Management Administration and
initiated preparation of a debt management strategy to improve rates and maturities, increase the
proportion of debt denominated in local currency and smooth future repayments. Although progress
in developing the municipal bond market was hampered by the financial crisis, steps were taken to
strengthen the coordination mechanism between the MoF and NBS, resulting in improving the
issuance of government securities. Further, the maturity of T bills has been extended gradually from
3 months to 6, 12, 18 and 24 months in 2010. Finally, the CPS period saw improvements in the
procedures established by the Public Debt Management Administration and the IT system, risk
assessment methodology, and overall debt management strategy and borrowing plan were
substantially strengthened.
30.
The World Bank Group also responded in a coordinated fashion. With the EBRD and
EIB, it launched a joint action plan in February 2009 to support the banking and real sectors of
each of the European countries in which these international financial institutions operate. A
subsequent conference was held in March 2009 in Vienna among the Serbian authorities, the IMF,
IFIs, including IFC, and key European banking groups with the objective of developing a ‘holistic’
joint-IFI strategic approach to tackle the financial crisis in Serbia. Within this context, IFC focused
on supporting existing clients both with capital investments and term funding and developing and
56

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

implementing capital support programs for the major banks in the country to promote systemic
stability. Also, through investments and advisory services to selected Serbian banks, IFC assisted
critical segments of the economy such as micro, small and medium size enterprises and agribusiness
sector.
31.
IFC invested US$69 million in equity to support bank capitalization, including: (i) US$21
million in capital increase to a bank supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and mortgage
financing; (ii) US$11.7 million to strengthen the capital of another bank and support its lending
activities to the MSME segment; and (iii) US$36.4 million equivalent preferred share investment in
the largest state-owned bank to help capitalize the bank and extend support to the SME sector. Also,
IFC provided US$140 million loans to four other banks strengthening their financial capacity to
extend much needed term funding to the agribusiness and SME sector during the global financial
crisis. In addition, right after the financial shock in September 2008, IFC injected liquidity in the
banking sector by disbursing US$30 million to two financial institutions.
Infrastructure development
32.
Investments in the transport sector led to improvements in the condition of the road
network and better road safety over the CPS period. The Bank-financed Transport Rehabilitation
Project (FY04) made solid progress vis a vis its targets. Under the project, over three hundred
kilometers of priority sections of the primary and secondary road network were rehabilitated with the
impact of (i) lowering roughness to an average on the rehabilitated sections of 3.7 on the IRI scale
from the baseline of 5, (ii) achieving an average reduction in vehicle operating costs of 14 percent to
date, and (iii) addressing 15 accident black spots. Additionally, as a result of the introduction of
performance-based contracting in two pilot regions, there was a cumulative reduction of 40 percent
in the unit costs for maintenance activities. With respect to road safety, data are also encouraging:
road crash-related injuries dropped by about one-third in the two pilot regions. Measured results
with respect to road crash related fatalities are inconsistent across the two pilot regions. While a
reduction of 22 percent in road crash related fatalities was recorded in Kolubara region in 2010
compared to 2009, there was an increase of 10 percent in Macva. Given the relatively small numbers
of accidents and fatalities, however, it is difficult to assess the impact of the road safety
improvements over such a short period. Data will have to be monitored over at least a 3-5 year
period to better understand the outcomes achieved as a result of recent road improvements. In
addition to physical improvements to the roads, the Bank also undertook a comprehensive Road
Safety Management Capacity Review (FY08) to help Government identify the key elements of
regulatory and institutional reforms needed to support better road safety. Key recommendations of
this Review were fully incorporated into a new law on road safety, which was adopted by the Serbian
Parliament in December 2009, and a new lead agency established to better coordinate and deliver
road safety improvements. Technical assistance is now being provided through the Corridor X
Highway Project (FY10) to assist in the establishment of a Lead Agency and develop a results
focused road safety strategy.

57

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

33.
Construction of Corridor X, a crucial highway connecting Serbia with Bulgaria and
Macedonia, faced some start-up delays but is now back on track; the project is likely to achieve its
results in the next CPS cycle, as planned. Although the highway is an extremely high priority for the
Government from the standpoints both of creating employment as well as lowering the costs of, and
promoting, economic activity, substantial delays were encountered in implementation, reflecting
initial uncertainty within Government about institutional responsibility for the project and whether
the establishment of a free-standing unit was warranted. Moreover, delays were encountered in
finalizing technical aspects and related procurement documents, reflecting the delay in the
operational establishment of the new unit, a lack of institutional coordination in Serbia, and
inadequate resources (both within the Bank and in Serbia) in dealing with the volume of work
involved. At this point, all detailed designs for the highway have been finalized, procurement of
major contracts has been processed, and Government has addressed most expropriation issues In
light of these developments, works are expected to begin shortly and last for about two years.
34.
Progress in the energy sector was very limited over the CPS period, and further structural
reforms of the sector and investments in generation capacity are needed. Although the electricity
markets in Serbia are liberalized in accordance with the ECSEE treaty, and the quality and efficiency
of the bulk power transmission system were improved (three new 110 kV substations and
interconnecting transmission lines have been constructed and are in full operation through the Bankfinanced ECSEE APL2 project), there was little progress on restructuring of the electricity supply
company (EPS) and on efforts to attract private investments in new generation capacity. Though
collection rates (around 94%) are reasonably robust, tariffs in Serbia remain well below full cost
recovery and investment needs and about one-third of EU27 average prices. It is worth noting
however, that although the CPS sought results with respect to EPS restructuring and private
generation capacity that were important for Serbia’s development, no appropriate instrument was
included in the program to support the achievement of these outcomes. The Bank’s role in electricity
was relatively narrowly limited to the construction of power lines to facilitate the development of a
regional electricity market, thereby limiting its influence on broader sectoral reforms.
Priority II: Providing opportunities and broadening participation in growth
Improving efficiency and accountability in public spending
35.
In parallel with its efforts to control expenditure to respond to fiscal pressure, the
Government also made some progress in improving the quality of budget planning/management
and rationalization of social sector spending during the CPS period. One outcome foreseen in the
CPS – which has not yet materialized -- was a move from an annual to a three-year budget.
Nonetheless, a number of steps were taken to improve public fiscal management including: (i) reform
of the Budget Systems Law; (ii) improvements in financial control, accounting and reporting; (iii)
strengthened debt management; and (iv) institution of a medium term focus for fiscal planning and
budget preparation. Moreover, building on recommendations of AAA on pensions undertaken by the
Bank as part of the Public Expenditure Review, Doing More with Less (FY09), a new Pension Law
was enacted to introduce parametric changes to the public pension system, which will put pension
58

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

expenditures on a more sustainable path. As a result of the reforms, transfers to the pension fund are
projected to decrease gradually, falling below 5% of GDP by 2015 (from 7.3% in 2010). A new
Social Assistance Law was also adopted by the parliament in March 2011. The new law would
improve the access of vulnerable groups to social assistance by applying equivalence scales for MOP
(Material Support for Low Income Households Program) in accordance with prevalent EU and
OECD practices. Budget allocations for the MOP have been adjusted accordingly. To increase
efficiency in health, Government has approved, and submitted to parliament, an amendment to the
public sector wage law that would allow health care staff to be paid, in part, on the basis of the
number of patients they serve. PER recommendations with regard to the education sector focused on
rationalizing school size in line with the students served. Following on the recommendations of the
analysis, Government closed 658 classrooms (1.4% of the total) for school year 2009/10. A further
533 classes have been closed thus far in 2011
36.
Virtually no headway was made on the CPS goal of increasing economic opportunities in
the depressed areas of Bor and Resavica. Due to significant delays in gaining parliamentary
approval of Bor Regional Development Project and a subsequent suspension of the project due to
Government’s inability to upgrade an outdated smelter, implementation activities began only towards
the end of the CPS period, so that results will only materialize in 2-3 years. The planned Resavica
Restructuring Project was dropped as Government was unable to proceed with restructuring and
privatization/resolution of the Resavica Coal Mining Enterprise, particularly given the 2009
recession. More generally, however, IFC supported more balanced regional development through an
Investment Climate Advisory Project on Sub-National Competitiveness, which addressed the
business enabling environment in four municipalities. Regulatory reform yielded savings in cost and
time of more than US$95 million in all localities. Cities were included in each region, and three of
the ten partner localities were in frontier regions.
Agriculture sector strengthening
37.
Substantial results were achieved in reducing and rationalizing agricultural subsidies.
Spending on agriculture market support – including for milk, exports and warehousing -- fell sharply
over the CPS period, declining from 30 percent of the MAFWM budget in 2007 to just 10.6 percent
by 2011. Currently the largest form of agricultural subsidies (33.7% of the MAFWM budget)
consists of the so-called “de-coupled area payment” which mirrors EU practice under the EU‘s
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The decoupled area subsidy consists of a standard payment
(equal to €120 per hectare) to every registered farmer, up to a maximum of 100 hectares. As of 2008,
full time farmers are eligible to receive the subsidy only if they contribute to the pension system.
38.
Delays in adopting a new Water Law hampered progress on planned irrigation
construction and rehabilitation interventions. A key precondition for development of irrigation
schemes under the Bank-supported Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project (FY06), was the
adoption of the new Water Law to provide a legal basis for the creation Water Users Associations
(WUAs) and the designs for rehabilitation and construction of new irrigation schemes. Adoption of
the Law was, however, subject to a delay of nearly 4.5 years due to the lack of political consensus.
59

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

As a result, work on the development of irrigation schemes could start only after approval of the law
in May 2010 and is expected to continue up to early 2013 – implying that the results associated with
this activity will only materialize in the next CPS period.
39.
The slow pace of the EU integration process for Serbia affected efforts to improve
agricultural systems as well as Serbia’s ability to meet EU standards and tap into EU export
opportunities. A Rural Development Strategy was developed and a supporting law approved. Within
this framework, the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Water Management (MAFWM) has
developed an IPARD-oriented National Rural Development Program (NRDP). A Rural Payment
Agency (RPA) was established in late 2009 and manages a Government of Serbia (GoS) agriculture
and rural development incentives programme. Payments are initiated through the treasury
administration system from about 140 offices nationwide. The MAFWM Sector for Rural
Development (SRD) is managing the rural development process which, prior to Serbia gaining EU
candidate status, aims to establish an IPARD-like management structure including a Managing
Authority (MA) and Monitoring Committee (MC). Although the MA has not yet been legally
established, its prototype is operational. The establishment of a Monitoring Committee (MC) is in a
very early stage. There is an ongoing process of setting up an Inter-ministerial Council an Expert
Group and a Council for Farmer’s Association.
40.
IFC focused on supporting its existing clients, low-cost producers and market leaders
helping them weather the crisis and expand their operations. IFC invested in one of the leading
food companies in the region to provide working capital and help finance its urgent capital
expenditure investments. Also, IFC invested in another leading company in the region to complete
its investment in a new particle board production plant. Through its investment in a Serbian private
sector group, with interests in manufacturing, agribusiness, and mining sectors, IFC helped the
company restructure its balance sheet, improve the risk profile, and continue its export oriented
growth. In addition to its own financing, IFC successfully mobilized long-term loans from other
financial institutions that sent a strong positive signal at the time when the global economy outlook
remained uncertain.

Protecting the vulnerable and improving social services
41.
The pension system has become more effective and efficient. With the merging of the three
public pension funds into a single institutional structure, administrative costs relative to pension
expenditure decreased from 2.2% in 2005 to 1.5% in 2010. Perhaps more importantly, a significant
improvement in the rate of collection of pension contributions was recorded between the years 2005
and 2010, as the Tax Administration collected 70 percent more funds in 2010 than it had in 2005.
After an extraordinary pension increase in late 2008, which resulted in pension payments as a share
of GDP jumping to 13.8 percent of GDP in 2009, pension payments were contained at 13 percent in
2010 (estimated) and are projected to continue decreasing gradually as a share of GDP. This
reduction is related to reforms that Government implemented to limit pension spending growth,
including a change in indexation and a freeze in pension increases. In the absence of the freeze,
pension spending would have risen to 15.8% of GDP in 2010 (rather than 13.0%)
60

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

42.
Social service quality and access were improved as was the legal framework for increasing
efficiency in the education and health sectors. The total number of beneficiaries of the MOP or
Material Support for Low Income Households (targeted last resort cash benefit program for the poor)
increased 6.5 percent between 2008 and 2009 and 20 percent between 2009 and 2010, reflecting both
improvements in targeting and program management and the impact of the recession on poverty.
Spending on the MOP increased 22 percent and 38 percent respectively between those years.
Coverage among the poorest quintile also increased, albeit slowly, going up from 7.9 percent of the
poorest quintile in 2008 to 8.7 percent in 2010 (measured in the first two quarters of 2010).
Moreover, the access of the poor to education has improved. Coverage of pre-school education
increased from 32 percent in 2002 to 45 percent in school year 2007/08, and the percentage of
(disadvantaged) Roma children attending primary school increased by 9.9 percent between 2009 and
2010. As a result of the health mediators program, family visits by Roma Health mediators increased
148 percent between 2008 and 2010, and the vaccination of Roma children increased 66 percent.
Further, the PEDPL series contributed to improving the efficiency of the education sector through
support for legislation that encouraged consolidation of an oversized system in line with
demographic changes and the projected reduction in number of school age children. In the two years
since its inception, school rationalization program has closed more than 1,100 classes throughout the
Serbian education system. The PEDPL also supported the adoption of legislation to introduce a
performance related payment for primary health care professionals, aimed at increasing the efficiency
with which primary health services are delivered. Other health indicators also show increased system
efficiency at the secondary and tertiary levels, largely due to the effective implementation of the
Serbia Health Project: between 2005 and 2009 acute care hospital beds were reduced by 12 percent;
discharges increased by 9.7 percent; average stay reduced by 10.6 percent, from 8 to 7.2 days; and
bed occupancy rates rose from 61.6 percent to 69 percent.
Priority III: Managing environmental and disaster risks
43.
Remediation of urgent environmental hazards, including tailing ponds and wastewater
discharge in the Bor region hasn’t been completed. The environmental management and
remediation related activities were under partial suspension until December 2010 due to
government’s failure to raise the resources needed to bring the RTB Bor’s core assets, and
particularly the smelter, in line with Serbian environmental standards. However, technical designs for
construction of the collector and remediation of tailings and waste sites have been ongoing during
this period and works are expected to be implemented in 2012 and 2013 since financing for
upgrading of the smelter has now been secured.
44.
Significant improvements in energy efficiency were achieved in the schools and hospitals
where works have been completed. Savings arising from the energy system conversion and
modernization of the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade (switch from crude oil to gas) alone has
saved the budget of the Ministry of Health around 75 million Serbian dinars (about US$1 million),
and allowed the Clinical Center to earn around 53 million Serbia dinars (aboutUS$600,000) through

61

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

delivery of energy to third parties. Moreover about 40 additional public buildings have been
retrofitted, dropping energy consumption 40% on average.
45.
Substantial results were achieved in reducing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution flows to
the Danube and tributaries from farms and slaughterhouses. With the Bank’s assistance through
the Danube River Enterprise Pollution Reduction Project more than 100 farms and 6 agricultural high
schools have adopted EU Nitrates Directive-compliant farm manure and nutrient management
practices that will reduce nutrient leakage into water bodies connected with the Danube River. Three
slaughterhouses and meat processing industries invested in proper waste management practices.
Additionally three rendering plants were provided with specialized trucks and equipment, which will
speed up the collection and processing of high-risk animal waste from slaughterhouses and farms,
thus reducing environmental pollution. The annual decrease in the amount of nutrients, which are not

IFC has supported sustainability across the region through investments and advisory.
Through its equity investment in a regional facility (Porr), IFC financed two regional landfills in
Serbia. Also, through its investment in a regional fund (GGF), IFC supported development of
renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. In parallel, IFC was also active in advisory
services. IFC assisted the Ministry for Environment and Spatial Planning to finalize the National
Strategy for Solid Waste Management (NSSWM) and prepare the Decree on Fees for Packaging
Waste Collection and Recycling. Also, IFC assisted in the preparation of a future Regional Waste
Management Centre for the inter-municipal enterprise in the region of Subotica. This is a model of
successful inter-municipal cooperation in the waste management sector.
47.
Moderate results were achieved in reducing the risk of damage from flooding to land,
crops, property, infrastructure, as well as reducing risk of loss of life from flooding. As of January
2011, 16 flood protection schemes were completed covering over 60,000 ha, while work on another 9
schemes protecting over 150,000 ha with over 300,000 people is ongoing. Major works are now
being tendered for these latter 9 schemes and work is expected to commence this summer/fall.
Furthermore, the regional Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility Project, which increases
homeowners’, farmers’ and SMEs’ access to financial protection from losses associated with natural
disasters, recently approved by the Bank’s Board, provides further protection in disaster-prone areas.

IV. WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
48.
Overall, the World Bank performance in designing and implementing the CPS program
was satisfactory. The program originally identified investments in each of the three CPS priorities for
FY08 and FY09, including loans for transport infrastructure, regional development, energy
generation, improved social services and participation in a regional disaster preparedness initiative.
A programmatic DPL series to strengthen the private and financial sector was also planned. The CPS
62

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

intended to provide substantial flexibility, with lending in FY10 and FY11 to be identified in the
CPSPR based on evolving country needs. Given domestic and external developments in late 2008
and 2009, the in-built flexibility of the CPS program was very helpful in responding quickly to
Government requests for program adjustments to respond to the crisis. The Government asked that
an additional US$300 million be allocated for new development policy lending, which would help
meet Serbia’s short to medium term financing needs and complement a coordinated assistance
package comprising EU and IMF assistance under the SBA. The Bank acted responsively in
providing additional funds and mobilizing the technical support needed to ensure a good quality
fiscal adjustment. In addition, the Government and Bank agreed to reprogram the bulk of investment
lending to support a major road corridor infrastructure project (Corridor X) because of its vital
economic importance and the potential of the project to provide new jobs at a time of recession.
49.
As referred to above, the original allocation of USD 600 million included in the CPS was
increased by an additional USD 300 million in November 2009. Half of the current Bank financing
for Serbia is directed at budget support through a series of development policy operations (DPOs)
and one Policy Based Guarantee (PBG). Three investment operations: Delivery of Improved Local
Services Project (US$ 46.3 million); Health Additional Financing Project (US$13.5 million); and
Corridor X Highway Project (US$ 388 million) were approved by the World Bank Board of
Executive Directors in March 2008, March 2009, and July 2009, respectively. Finally, the Board
approved US$5 million the regional Catastrophic Rick Insurance Facility Project Of the series of
development policy lending operations, the Private and Financial Sector DPL series (FY09 US$ 50
mil, and FY10 US$ 100 mil,) and the Private and Financial Sector PBG (US$ 400 million) focus on
supporting the Government’s reform program in the areas of: real sector privatization, business
environment and financial sector strengthening. The Public Expenditure DPL series (FY10 USD 100
mil, FY11 USD 100 mil), originally focused on improved systems for public sector management, and
was expanded to include measures to strengthen both public expenditure allocation and social
assistance in light of the 2009 recession. Coordination with the IMF and the EU has been close.
50.
Analytical and Advisory Activities provided timely policy advice to improve the quality and
sustainability of Serbia’s fiscal adjustment. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) “Doing More
with Less”, the Bank’s flagship AAA report in FY09, which provided useful input to the PEDPL
series and the IMF SBA on ongoing sector and subsidy reforms, was followed-up in FY10-11 by
just-in-time assistance to identify potential structural savings in the public sector wage bill. The
World Bank supported roundtable discussions with civil society stakeholders on second-generation
reforms that could form a sustainable policy framework over the medium-term. To date, discussions
have addressed pensions, a volatile political issue with major fiscal implications; modernization and
efficiency of the education system; and the potential for private sector participation in critical
infrastructure investments. Work on the Country Economic Memorandum commenced recently, in
early 2011, so its impact cannot be identified at this time. The Ministry of Finance and the other
stakeholders in corporate financial reporting have actively participated in the World Bank Centre for

63

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

Financial Reporting Reform’s REPARIS27 program, aimed at assisting Western Balkans countries to
improve corporate financial reporting systems and gradually implement the relevant EU acquis
communautaire. The World Bank has provided an IDF program in FY10 and FY11 to assist in
development of a national strategy for financial reporting reforms. As of May 2011 the Ministry of
Finance has prepared draft laws to introduce appropriate financial reporting and statutory audit
requirements required for EU integration.
51.
Apart from the multi-sectoral and cross-cutting activities mentioned above, a number of
sector-specific AAA activities were undertaken to underpin lending and provide just-in-time policy
guidance. A Road Financing Study, prepared in FY08, reviewed the administration and institutional
structure of the road sector and provided suggestions to improve the revenue flow for primary,
secondary and local roads. Another study examined Options for the Improvement of the Toll
Regime on the Motorway Network. An FY08 Environmental Compliance Policy Note took stock of
the progress Serbia had made in protecting its environment since the 2003 Kiev Environment for
Europe Conference and identified medium-term actions to promote further progress. The Note
focused on waste management; biodiversity conservation and energy and environment linkages. A
PIEM Review helped the government to improve the system of financing of infrastructure projects
through the National Investment Plan. A baseline survey was undertaken on the cost and efficiency
of Serbia’s Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and the results helped determine PHC payments reforms
and established baselines for tracking of health sector performance. Through a FY09 Policy Note on
Growth, the Bank entered in the policy dialogue on regional development and spending on human
development. An FY09 Capital Markets Development TA program identified obstacles to capital
market development and provided assistance in addressing priority issues -- including development
of the bond market, development of an EU-oriented capital markets strategy and selected legal and
regulatory reforms. The Bank also delivered TA to identify obstacles and provide advice on the
legislative framework and institutional set up needed to upgrade and commercialize Serbia’s
innovation and technological capacity. Other FY10 just-in-time assistance included analysis of
pension system needs, strengthening of capital markets and domestic savings; research and
innovation, and efficiency of municipal enterprises. The World Bank has also been providing
technical assistance in FY10-11 for education reform (a long neglected sector in Serbia) and is
coordinating support for justice sector strengthening through a multi-donor trust fund.
52.
As of March 2011, the active portfolio consisted of 12 projects, with total commitments of
US$845.8 million, of which about US$625.4 million remains available for disbursement. The
proportion of commitments at risk, a measure of the likelihood that projects will not meet their stated
development objectives on time, represented 11.3 percent of the portfolio, which is slightly better
than the averages for the Western Balkans (16.8%) and for the ECA region as a whole (15.2%).
Three projects are currently considered to be at risk. The consolidated project disbursement ratio of
26.5 percent, and the current FY11 disbursement ratio of 8 percent, which compared unfavorably
with the Western Balkans (12.5%) and ECA averages (15.8%), are low. A number of strategic
27

64

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

portfolio management issues behind this poor performance were identified, such as significant delays
in making projects effective; deficiency in project preparation, where client preparation of designs,
feasibility studies, and bid documents only began after effectiveness; and difficulties of inter-agency
and inter-ministry coordination in complex operations.
53.
At present, one of the eleven projects comprising the Bank’s active portfolio is rated
unsatisfactory – namely, the Transitional Agriculture Reform Project. The Bor Regional
Development Project was recently upgraded, following signing of a financing agreement with the
Canadian Export Bank in December 2010 to bring the RTB Bor core assets, and particularly the
smelter, in line with Serbian environmental standards. This was the key precondition for lifting the
partial suspension of the project related to environmental management and remediation and enables
the resumption of key project activities which should lead to an improvement in performance rating.
The Transitional Agriculture Reform Project underwent restructuring and improvements are already
apparent, although they need to be consolidated. Finally, a concrete action plan for improving the
implementation of the Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project, that for months was rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory, was completed in early fall 2010 and the project is now achieving the
agreed targets. All other projects are rated moderately satisfactory to satisfactory (Table 2).

V. LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW CPS
55.
The emphasis on alignment of CPS activities with the EU integration agenda should be
maintained for the new CPS. There is a wide political and popular consensus on the EU perspective
for Serbia, which can help surmount differences of philosophy and approach among key actors in
Serbian politics and civil society. Maintaining a close link between CPS objectives and Serbia’s own
strategy for EU integration thus played an important role in maintaining a forward trajectory on CPS
activities, albeit sometimes with significant delays. For example, difficult and politically sensitive
reforms in the pensions sector were helped by benchmarking to EU practices and expectations with
respect to fiscal management. Similarly, efforts in the privatization and private sector development
and in financial sector reform areas were helped by the experience of the EU10 countries which
became EU members relatively recently after addressing problems similar to those faced by Serbia.
56.
The use of programmatic DPL series underpinned by high quality AAA was a successful
means of supporting and sustaining a difficult policy and institutional reform effort, which should
be employed again for the new CPS. The two programmatic DPL lending series (PFDPLs I-IV and
PEDPL I-II) and associated analytical work played an important role in helping to concretize and
66

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

keep on track the main elements of the Serbian Government’s macroeconomic and growth agendas.
Solid analytical work, which underpinned each of the series, was an important vehicle for building
consensus on key reform areas with Serbian domestic actors a necessary step in the country’s
relatively polarized political environment. The DPL series and analytical work also helped coalesce
cooperation with key external partners such as the IMF and European institutions, who partnered
with the Government and Bank in supporting the DPL reform agenda. Finally, the flexibility
afforded by programmatic DPL lending (to adjust sequencing and emphases within a set of broad
policy goals) was particularly useful when the global crisis affected Serbia – the in-built flexibility
allowed the Bank to quickly support the government in its efforts to respond to emerging priorities.
57.
Design of investment operations should take care to maintain a clear focus on a relatively
narrow set of objectives and avoid (to the extent feasible) involvement of multiple agencies in
project management. Given the diverse coalition that comprises the present Government – and the
likelihood that a coalition Government will also emerge from the next electoral round – there can be
differences in approach when multiple agencies involved in a project are headed by different
coalition partners. This, in turn, can sometimes politicize project issues or lead to lengthy
disagreements which stall implementation for extended periods. Limiting operations to a narrow set
of closely related objectives within the purview of a single agency could help avoid some of these
issues. Moreover, implementation agencies’ commitment to project activities and implementation
capacity should be carefully considered during project preparation. When projects are housed with
strong institutions, it can take time to reach initial agreement, but prospects for successful
implementation are high. Weak institutions are less likely to implement agreements even if there is a
high level of formal “ownership.” Finally, successful implementation requires that adequate staff
resources on both the Bank’s and the Government’s sides are dedicated for project implementation,
taking into account the actual volumes of work anticipated at different stages of a project. In the
Corridor X project, for example, the lack of institutional clarity on project management coupled with
difficulties in keeping up with the sheer volume of procurement activities led to significant delays in
project start-up. These latter delays could certainly have been avoided if procurement needs had
been more carefully anticipated and put in place early in the process.
58.
Steady consolidation of the portfolio with a focus on fewer, larger operations is likely to
improve portfolio performance by helping to maintain high-level attention on implementation
within the government and in the Bank. The Bank’s current portfolio consists mainly of small
projects in numerous sectors, which were mainly inherited form the previous CPS. The FY08-11
CPS already saw a trend towards consolidation (e.g., 2-3 planned operations were replaced by the
large, high priority Corridor X project) and this should continue for the next CPS period, provided
greater attention is paid to institutional requirements earlier in the project cycle and end-goals are set
in a realistic way. A smaller portfolio of higher priority, visible projects is also more likely to
receive concerted attention from senior decision-makers in Government. In this context, it should be
noted that strengthening the Ministry of Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-à-vis
the implementing agencies could help improve portfolio performance. Recent efforts to engage the
MoF in a regular dialogue on the portfolio has shown some promise in terms of reducing decision67

CPS Completion Report FY08-11

making time. The recently established quarterly joint MoF-Bank portfolio meetings should be
continued in the next CPS as well.
59.
Close coordination with the EC with other development partners, and International
Financial Institutions (IMF, EBRD, EIB) should be maintained. The World Bank, the IMF, and
EC closely coordinated in providing budget support to Serbia to respond to the financial crisis, by
ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment and develop a viable crisis framework for the
financial sector. There has also been close cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and other development partners on
infrastructure projects, including the large Corridor X project. Furthermore, the Bank has been
working closely with the EC in setting up a new mechanism for financing research and development
in Serbia. The positive momentum could be turned into greater use of the EC’s Instrument for PreAccession (IPA) for leveraging bank’s scarce resources over the next CPS period.
60.
The results framework, and monitoring and evaluation, should be strengthened in the next
CPS and attention should be paid to the availability of appropriate instruments to support the
achievement of stated outcomes. The new CPS should explicitly set out the mechanisms for
monitoring the results framework, the responsibilities for reporting on progress towards achievement
of CAS outcomes, and the use of evaluation information for decision-making. Data collection and
reporting on outcomes need to be improved across the portfolio. Project teams will also need to focus
on helping sectors develop M&E systems which would in turn help project data collection and
reporting. In a few cases, design of the outcome should have been calibrated better with the specific
instruments included in the CPS. For example, outcomes included in the framework with respect to
Electricity Company restructuring and promotion of private energy generation capacity were not
necessarily well aligned with planned Bank-supported activities in the sector which focused narrowly
on the construction of transmission lines to facilitate integration with the regional market.

Even in this challenging area, the clear

the Government was achieved in part due to
full integration of the project activities with
