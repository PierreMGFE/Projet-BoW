COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
FYOS-FY13

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Past assistance and partnership strategies of the Bank Group have sought to assist
Mexico in its efforts to undertake the large economic, social and institutional changes of the
last two decades. Much has been transformed in Mexico, and much remains to be done. The
challenges are to increase the rate of sustainable and inclusive growth and to pursue policies
that w i l l allow nearly 45 million Mexicans to escapefrom poverty.

2.
The agenda of the Bank for middle income countries is well adapted to support the
development strategy of President Calderon, now in his second year of ofice. That strategy
was set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2012. The Plan focuses on five strategic
pillars including competitiveness, security and the rule of law, effective democracy, equality
of opportunity and environmental sustainability. Notwithstanding steady progress in the past
twenty years, Mexico still faces serious problems of poverty and it needs to improve
competitiveness in order to accelerate growth. The Government recognizes that continued
assistance from the international financial community can help Mexico make headway in
resolving those problems.
3.
I n recent years, there has been a notable change in the dynamic of the Bank’s
relationship with Mexico. Experience from the implementation of the last CPS and feedback
from the government indicate the need for increasingly flexible, on-demand services,
especially advisory services and technical assistance. At the same time, the key role of the
Bank as a lender is also understood.
4.
The Bank and the government have agreed on an approach that would enhance the
Bank’s effectiveness and responsiveness through a streamlined IBRD lending program, and
an expanded program of analytic and advisory activities (AAA). Most lending would be
consolidated into an annual Development Policy Loan (DPL) that supports the government’s
own national development strategy. The AAA program w i l l be carefully tailored to country
demands and would respond rapidly to emerging opportunities. Finally, the CPS intends to
reinforce efforts to coordinate development assistance across the World Bank Group. To
anchor the transition to this streamlined approach, a proposed $500 million DPL (with
Deferred Drawdown Option) accompanies this CPS.

IFC w i l l continue providing support in the financial sector with special emphasis on
increasing access to finance to underserved segments of the population and continue
promoting the development of the housing finance market. The other priority areas for
investment and advisory activities include improving the quality of health and education
5.

sectors and physical infrastructure and promoting reforms that continue strengthening the
investment climate.

6.
Rationale for the Streamlined Approach.
The rationale for moving to a
streamlined approach is based on particular characteristics of Mexico: (a) an established
track record of sound macroeconomic management; (b) substantial remaining long term
development challenges - sustainable and equitable growth; (e) continued demand for World
Bank Group engagement in a broad policy dialogue and specijk, focused advisory services;
and (d) competitive access to finance and superior debt management. The new streamlined
approach focuses Bank resources on an enhanced program of non-lending services while
minimizing both thefinancial and non-financial costs of borrowing from IBRD.
7.

Structure of the Streamlined Approach. The streamlined approach would be
anchored on a large multi-sector DPL that would follow the operational guidelines for such
loans: a focus on the government’s own reform program (e.g., National Development
Program) with a set of prior actions. Annual base lending to the federal government would
be $800 million over the next three years. At that time, a mid-term review would determine
the future lending amounts. Lending amounts could be adjusted depending upon IBRD
pricing competitiveness and market conditions. I n parallel, the Bank and the government
would reach agreement on a complementary set of advisory services that would support the
government ’s development program.

8.

Risks. The main risks to this development partnership emerge from both domestic
and external factors. Domestic factors are fiscal dependency on oil revenues, long-run
competitiveness, social cohesion and consensus building for reforms and the potential for
natural calamities - in particular, earthquakes and hurricanes. On the external front, the
high degree of correlation of economic activity with key trading partners and associated
declines in exports and/or remittances pose a risk. The government has taken a number of
important actions in recent years to mitigate these risks and actions supported by the CPS
should serve as mitigating factors as well.
9.

Executive Directors may wish to consider thefollowing issuesfor discussion.
Does the flexible streamlined approach to IBRD lending, combined with an
enhanced program of analytic and advisory activities, adequately reflect the
Bank’s policy for working in middle-income countries?
Are the risks well identified and mitigating factors sufficient for assuring the
likelihood of successful implementation ?

UNITED MEXICAN STATES
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

FY08-FY13'
A. INTRODUCTION

1.
The last World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mexico was
prepared in March 2004. A CPS Progress Report was prepared in January 2007 and
covers FY07-08.

2.
Past assistance and partnership strategies o f the Bank Group have sought to assist
Mexico in its efforts to undertake the large economic, social and institutional changes o f
the last two decades. M u c h has been transformed in Mexico, and much remains to be
done. The challenges are to increase the rate o f growth in a sustainable and inclusive
way and to pursue policies that will allow nearly 45 million Mexicans to escape from
poverty.
3.
The government o f President Felipe Calderbn, now in its second year o f office,
has developed a long term vision o f Mexico for the year 2030, as well as policies for
promoting human development in the current administration, which spans the period
2006-2012. The policies have been detailed in the National Development Plan (NDP)*.
The agenda o f the Bank for middle income countries (MICs) i s well adapted to support
the development strategy o f President Calderbn.
In recent years, there has been a notable change in the dynamic o f the Bank's
4.
relationship with Mexico. Experience from the implementation o f the last CPS and
feedback from the government indicate the need for increasingly flexible, on-demand
services, especially advisory services and technical assistance. At the same time, the key
role o f the Bank as a lender i s also understood.

5.
The Bank and the government have agreed on an approach that would enhance
the Bank's effectiveness and responsiveness through a streamlined IBRD lending
program, and an expanded program o f analytic and advisory activities (M).
Most
lending would be consolidated into an annual Development Policy Loan (DPL) that
supports the government's own national development strategy. The AAA program will
be carehlly tailored to country demands and would respond rapidly to emerging
opportunities. Finally, the CPS intends to reinforce efforts to coordinate development
assistance across the World Bank Group.

'

Mexico i s not currently a member o f MIGA; however, the government has signed an agreement to join
MIGA that i s pending Congressional ratification.

B. CURRENT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
Economic Developments

6.
The average annual rate o f economic growth over the 2004-07 period has been 3.8
percent. A vigorous global economic expansion contributed to the enhanced growth
performance: the nominal dollar value o f total exports increased at an annual rate o f 13.4
percent during this period. Annual inflation was 3.8 percent at the end o f 2007.
7.
Higher-than-expected o i l and tax revenue allowed the public sector to increase
current and capital expenditures and, at the same time, post very small fiscal surpluses in
2006 and 2007. A balanced budget requirement i s part o f a federal budget and fiscal
responsibility law adopted in 2006. In terms o f a broader “public sector borrowing
requirements” that includes off-budget spending, the Mexican public sector also has
managedto restrain i t s debt financing requirements to about 1 to 2 percent o f GDP.
8.
Current macroeconomic policies are consistent and sustainable. Macroeconomic
policy has focused on fiscal balance, active public debt management to lengthen the
maturity and reduce exposure to exchange rate risk, monetary policy based on inflation
targeting and a flexible exchange rate. Stability has been secured with only one
significant slowdown (2001-2002), since the crisis o f the mid 1990s and a steady decline
in inflation. The markets have reacted to these prudent policies: sovereign spreads have
declined and credit rating agencies have upgraded Mexico’s sovereign debt rating (see
Figure 1).
9.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects. Economic growth i s decelerating
this year. A sharper-than-expected slowing o f economic activity in the U.S. i s likely to
hit Mexico harder than other countries and i s an important risk to the Mexican economy.
With the increased economic integration following NAFTA, Mexican industrial
production has become highly correlated with industrial production in the United state^.^
The government has reduced i t s growth forecast to 2.8 percent in 2008. Depending on
the severity o f the deceleration o f the U S economy, growth could be even lower. On the
other hand, several factors could muffle the impact o f a slowdown in the United States,
relative to historical experience: (a) the continued consolidation o f public finances and
the reduction in external indebtedness; (b) the recovery o f bank lending to the private
sector; and (c) an increasing diversification o f export destinations (although the United
States remains the main destination at about 82 percent). Apart from these short term
considerations, growth has been modest relative to the country’s potential-a
phenomenonthat the Bank has called the “economic development p ~ z z l e . ” ~
3

The Bank has calculated a simple correlation coefficient o f about 0.95 in recent years, compared to about
0.69 in the early 1990s. IMF staff has estimated a “rule o f thumb” elasticity o f U S industrial production
shocks on Mexican quarterly GDP: a one percent shock in U S industrial production creates a 0.9 percent
shock on Mexican GDP. See IMF Mexico: Selected Issues, December 2007. Swiston and Bayoumi
estimate an even larger relationship (“Spillovers Across NAFTA,” IMF Working Paper WP/08/3).
See the World Bank’s “policy notes” publication, Mexico 2006-2012: Creating the Foundations for
Equitable Growth.

10.
Debt Management. Mexico successfilly reduced i t s public debt-to-GDP ratio
and implemented a debt management strategy that favors domestic currency financing o f
public debt over the past few years. The government now regularly issues fixed-rate peso
bonds up to 30 years o f maturity and the average maturity o f domestic debt increased to
5.5 years by the end o f 2007. The government’s debt management strategy for 2008’
establishes two main lines o f action: (i)
to continue to finance the federal government’s
deficit primarily by longer term, domestic currency debt, and (ii)
to strengthen the cost
and maturity profile o f external debt and reduce external market debt by $500 million.
Despite a significant reduction in external debt over the past few years, the strategy
recognizes the importance o f maintaining a presence on international capital markets and
assuring an efficient dollar yield-curve as a reference for public and private sector
emissions. External finance provided by multilateral development banks i s explicitly
excluded from the external debt reduction target. In addition to adequate financial terms
and conditions, the strategy expresses the interest o f the government to maintain an active
relationship with multilateral development banks to take advantage o f the technical
assistance and international experience in the management o f programs and projects that
these organizations can contribute.
A detailed public sector and external debt
sustainability assessment i s included in the IMF Article I V consultation discussed and
published last December.6

C. LONG RUN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
11.
As mentioned above, Mexico’s long run economic performance has been
puzzling. T o some extent, economic and social outcomes have placed Mexico
persistently entrenched between two worlds: the less developed world and the high
income members o f the OECD (see Figure 2). Average income levels and social
indicators consistently reveal this pattern. More accelerated long-run growth will be
needed to break this pattern, but this will require improved competitiveness through
lowering barriers to business investment, improved infrastructure, expanded financial
sector and faster human capital accumulation.
12.
The other puzzling phenomenon i s that there are two worlds within Mexico.
Income per capita in northern states i s closer to the income per capita o f the American
South than to the income per capita o f the Mexican south. Social outcomes, access to
public services and the quality o f services also reveal a similar geographic pattern. This
is exacerbated by sharp differences across ethnic groups as well.
13.
These two themes cut across traditional sectors, and there is increasing consensus
in Mexico, both among policy makers and the general public, with regards to the long run
development challenges facing the country. The World Bank Group has participated in
this debate through extensive analytic work and policy dialogue. The debate has centered
on the following areas:
e3

Accelerating Growth;

e3

Improving Competitiveness;

e3

Promoting social inclusion and reducing poverty;

e3

Developing infrastructure and assuring energy security;

e3

Strengthening institutions; and

e$.

Assuring environmental sustainability.

14.

Below i s a brief summary o f some o f the key issues, based o n recent analytic
work conducted by the World Bank Group. There i s substantial overlap across these
areas.

15.

Accelerating growth. One key issue, as mentioned above, i s that per capita
economic growth over the last quarter century has not kept pace with OECD countries,
nor has i t kept pace with top performing emerging market economies, as demonstrated in
Figure 2. Accelerating growth will require improvements in the investment climate,
infrastructure, human capital and the innovation system. In brief, it requires progress in a
variety o f complementary areas discussed below.7

’

These complementary reform areas are discussed in more depth in Mexico 2006-2012: Creating the
Foundations for Equitable Growth.

Growth. The Doing Business in Mexico report provides comparative doing business indicators across the

stability, total factor productivity grew at around 1 percent per year, less than h a l f the
growth rate o f the decades prior to the debt crisis o f the 1980s and substantially slower
than the top global performers o f the past decade. The figures below provide a couple o f
dimensions o f the problem from an international perspective.

17.
In very general terms, key factors arise in the debate and in both Bank and local
logistics costs,
analyses o f competitiveness: (i)high cost o f infrastructure services; (ii)
(iii)
competition from informal firms; (iv) l o w investment in productive innovation; and
(v) access to financial services. The first issue i s closely related to the inefficiency o f
certain state dominated sectors (e.g., electricity and water), and the institutional design o f
private sector regulation that results in limited competition for service provision (e.g.,
telecommunications).
18.
Secondly, the existing international comparisons o f logistics performance (e.g.,
the ability o f countries to deliver goods in time and at l o w costs from origin to destination
throughout the world) show that Mexico has substantial room for improvement (see
Figure 3 above). Thirdly, the investment climate survey o f Mexico indicates that firms
complain o f the effect o f unfair competition, and sectors with a greater presence o f
informal f i r m s often lag other sectors in terms o f productivity. A fourth issue i s that
higher rates o f innovation require both improved links between the research and business
communities, regulatory improvements o n intellectual property rights and improved
quality and coverage o f education. The latter will also be discussed below; however, i t i s
noteworthy that 75 percent o f the labor force has only a basic level o f education or less.
Finally, the financial system i s beginning to expand access to credit, following the longlasting, debilitating effects o f the financial crisis o f the mid-1990s.

Promoting Social Inclusion and Reducing P ~ v e r t y .As
~ mentioned above, there
are “two worlds” within Mexico: income per capita in the north is closer to the poorest

states o f the U S than to the poorest states o f southern Mexico; urban elites attend private
top domestic schools and universities, or they study overseas; and urban elites enjoy
quality health care that meets high international standards.

20.
In terms o f poverty” trends, Mexico has made steady progress in poverty
reduction since the economic crisis o f the mid 1990s, when poverty peaked at 70 percent.
Poverty has subsequently fallen, but national and rural poverty rates did not recover to
pre-crisis levels until 2002. (See Figure 4.) Overall poverty rates remain high, with
almost 45 million Mexicans living in poverty and with persistent and substantial
differences across regions and ethnic groups. Furthermore, the poor may be more
vulnerable to h t u r e labor market shocks, as they have the worst labor market insertion
rates and their human capital endowments are growing slowly. The evidence indicates
that poor individuals have l o w human capital endowments, and they are more likely to be
employed in the informal sector. The high degree o f informality, the barriers to access to
formal jobs, and the characteristics o f poor individuals all indicate that the poor’s labor
market insertion may be worse now than 15 years ago.
2 1.
The distribution o f income in Mexico is skewed - much more so than i t s OECD
peers. The equality o f opportunities i s also skewed due to persistent problems in social
services. Most notably, in the education system, there i s the need to improve quality
throughout the system, expand coverage o f secondary education and create more
equitable access to higher education. Opportunities for social and economic progress can
be stifled by health problems and the limited coverage and poor quality o f health services
for the needy. The elderly are also over-represented in the lower end o f the income
distribution due to gaps in the social protection system for the elderly. Formal coverage
o f the work force in social security and health is only around 40 percent. These general
themes require institution building and policy reforms over time, and the government i s
actively working o n solutions. In addition, there i s the nexus o f issues related to
competitiveness in terms o f enterprise growth and j o b creation to provide opportunities
for poverty reduction. Finally, there are issues o f deepening the understanding o f poverty
through improved measurement, including multi-dimensional approaches.

Mexico: Making Education More Effective by Compensating for Disadvantages, Introducing School-based
Management, and Enhancing Accountability. A summary o f the Bank’s work o n education in Mexico i s
presented in the Mexican journal: “El Banco Mundial y l a e d u c a c i h en MCxico,” Revista de Educacibn y
Cultura, February 2008. Also see Chapters 4 and 7 o f the “policy notes” publication mentioned above.
The Bank is currently working o n a fee-based advisory service for the measurement o f poverty and
evaluation o f social programs and a variety o f NLTA in education, including participation in advisory
councils and state level work.

Poverty estimates are calculated based o n the recommended methodology o f Mexico’s National
Committee for Poverty Measurement (CTMP). This methodology uses net per capita household current
income as the measure o f well-being and a recommended basket o f food (Basic Foods Basket, CFA) for the
poverty line. This bundle i s calculated separately for urban and rural areas.

The hydrocarbons
sector i s at a crossroads in terms o f Mexico's long run economic development. Mexico
has ranked as the sixth largest producer o f o i l in recent years; however, i t i s the only
major producer to have experienced sharp declines in the proven reserves o f o i l (Figure
5) which have now reached less than 10 years o f current production levels. The economy
and the export base have diversified away from the o i l sector; however, the sector still
represents about 15 percent o f merchandise exports. In addition, the Mexican public
sector remains heavily dependent on o i l revenue which in 2006 made up 38 percent o f
total public sector revenue, whereas non-oil tax revenue remains at a modest 10 percent

however, the sector s t i l l represents about 15 percent o f merchandise exports. Inaddition,
the Mexican public sector remains heavily dependent on o i l revenue which in 2006 made

The service quality o f Mexico’s main electricity provider, the Comisibn Federal
de Electricidad (National Electric Company, CFE), has improved but s t i l l lags behind
international standards and client expectations, as measured by service interruptions and
the number o f customer complaints. The service quality and operating efficiency o f the
other electricity provider, Luz y Fuerza del Centro (LFC), are even worse.12 In addition
to reforms in the traditional forms o f electricity generation and distribution, there i s
tremendous scope for progress in renewable energy, including hydro power, wind power
and bio-fuels.

Despite great variability among regions and income levels, Mexico’s level o f
coverage o f infrastructure services relative to the rest o f Latin America i s appropriate to
i t s income level. However, the quality and reliability o f infrastructure services are
generally below what could be expected o f an upper-middle-income country. In addition
to hurting the standard o f living o f Mexican citizens, the poor quality o f infrastructure
impedes competitiveness.
25.
Water and sanitation services are subject to the volatility o f urban politics and
finance and thus vary greatly in quality and coverage across regions o f Mexico, among
urban areas, and along the rural, peri-urban and urban axis. In the transport sector, road
quality remains the primary challenge with a relatively effective and efficient port and
rail network. Under pressure from growing traffic volumes, Mexico’s aging road
network, particularly where run by states and municipalities, is in poor condition and

badly in need o f rehabilitation and improved maintenance. Likewise, while there has
been important progress in access to finance for the construction o f l o w cost housing,
more remains to be done--especially in attending to the quality o f housing stock and basic
service provision for the lower income segments o f the population.

26.
Strengthening institution^.'^ A cross-cutting theme i s institutional reform, and
this i s the case whether one considers public sector governance or private sector
regulation. In addition, i t applies to both line ministries (secretariats) and governmentwide processes. Finally, there i s an important dimension with respect to subnational
governments, where there is the need to replicate federal level improvements or
disseminate local innovation.
27.
The public sector agenda ranges from transparency, to systems overhaul, c i v i l
service reform, results-based budgeting and systems for monitoring and evaluating
government activities.
28.
In recent years, there were substantial improvements in the transparency o f
government action with the passage o f landmark access to information legislation and the
creation o f an effective institute (IFAI) to implement the law. A web-based instrument
for government procurement decisions, called COMPRANET, also increased
transparency o f government purchases; however, the scope o f purchases covered by the
system could be extended to a greater share o f total purchases. The government has
increased resources and activities for monitoring and evaluating government expenditures
and there are new proposals for moving towards results based budgeting. There is the
need to extend the use o f COMPRANET to subnational governments. In addition, at the
subnational level, there i s the need for fundamental accounting standards and
harmonization o f these standards.
29.
Assuring Environmental S~stainability.'~ Environmental degradation i s a
limiting factor to economic growth, competitiveness and social welfare. The economic
cost o f environmental degradation i s estimated at about 9 percent o f GDP; however, this
represents a decline o f 2 percentage points since the late 1990s. Nearly 90 percent o f this
cost is due to air pollution, so a key issue i s energy use. K e y environmental sustainability
issues include air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and loss
o f biodiversity. Mexico has critical and urgent water related problems including the
overexploitation and contamination o f surface water and groundwater resources in the
l3 See chapter 1 o f the policy notes publication for an overview o f institutional issues related to the policy
making process. The report Institutions and Governance in Mexico provides a m u c h more detailed analysis
o f these issues. The Bank has also prepared a C P A R and a CPAR Update t o review procurement
arrangements. The Bank i s currently working with the government o n the process required for moving
towards results based budgeting, with a multilateral conference planned for the coming months. The Bank
i s also conducting AAA for harmonization o f budgetary and accounting standards across states.
l4 See chapter 6 o f the policy notes for a more thorough overview o f environmental issues. In addition,
chapter 9 provides a more detailed focus o n water issues, given that it is identified as the prime
environmental sustainability problem facing Mexico. A number o f other studies have been financed by
Bank environmental loans and bilateral grants that are part o f the Bank's engagement with Mexico in t h i s
sector.

regions where most o f the people reside and where the great majority o f the GDP i s
generated. The unsustainable use o f water in these water scarce areas i s a constraint to
economic growth and competitiveness. I t also disproportionately affects access and
quality o f services to the poor and degrades the environment. Irrigation is the largest user
o f water resources, accounting for 77 percent o f withdrawals. Mexico has made
important strides in water rights administration, water resources monitoring and
assessment, water resources planning and basin level institution building that provide a
good foundation for moving towards sustainable water resources management. Global
public goods in the environmental realm represent another important area, and in the case
o f climate change, Mexico has been a leader among developing countries in addressing
both mitigation and adaptation issues.

D. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT VISION
The Calder6n administration prepared i t s National Development Plan, and the
first annual progress report was presented in September 2007. In addition, the plan
evolves over time with additional details developed and pre-set objectives. The
government recently presented a national infrastructure plan that lays out a more detailed
work program to address Mexico’s infrastructure needs. Below i s a very brief description
o f the National Development Plan (NDP).
30.

31.
Sustainable Human Development i s the overarching theme o f the National
Development Plan. The Plan describes this as: “The purpose o f development consists o f
creating an atmosphere in which all can increase their capacity and opportunities can
expand for current and future generations.”

32.

The government’s national development plan i s based on five pillars:

*:

This pillar i s based on the fundamental premise
that people need guarantees o f personal safety and protection o f their property for
sustained human development. Objectives and strategies in this pillar are
organized in areas such as compliance with the law, effective and equal access to
justice for all, the fight against corruption, drug-trafficking and organized crime,
and the prevention o f crime and violence. Public opinion polls have consistently
shown that Mexican society places a high priority on these issues.

*:

Economic competitiveness and generation of jobs.
An enhanced level o f
sustained economic growth, at an annual rate o f 5 percent by 2012, and the

Rule of law andpublic safety.

generation, by 2012, o f at least 800,000 formal sector jobs annually are the main
quantitative targets identified in this pillar o f the plan (pages 82 and 102 o f the
NDP). In order to achieve these targets, objectives and strategies in a large
number o f areas and sectors, including public finance, financial sector,
infrastructure, rural development, small and medium enterprise and competition
policy, are aligned to strengthen the levels o f investment in physical capital,

12

increase the level o f human capital and skills, and raise the level o f productivity
growth.

*:

Equality of Opportunities. The reduction o f inequalities and the provision o f
equal opportunities that allow solving the causes o f poverty are the focus o f the
administration’s social policy. The guiding principles o f this policy are: targeting
o f resources on programs that have demonstrated their effectiveness, extensive
use o f monitoring and evaluation systems, and the development and use o f a
unique register o f government sponsored social program beneficiaries.
Government programs and policies in areas such as poverty reduction, health,
education, indigenous people, gender equality and vulnerable groups are included
in this pillar.

*:*

Environmental sustainability. The main initiative in this pillar is to turn the
concept o f environmental sustainability into a transversal element o f public
policies and assure that all public and private investments are compatible with
environmental protection. Objectives and strategies are structured in areas such as
water, forests, climate change, biodiversity, solid waste and cross-cutting
environmental sustainability policy instruments. As part o f the development plan,
Mexico published a comprehensive National Strategy on Climate Change which
includes greenhouse gas emissions reduction estimates as well as measures to
adapt to the impact o f climate change. As a larger, natural resource rich emerging
market economy, Mexico sees itself well placed to take a prominent role in the
international agreements and cooperation o n global environment issues.

*:

Effective democracy and responsible foreign affairs. The last chapter o f the
national development plan focuses on democracy as an effective system o f
government that promotes development and well-being o f the population and a
foreign affairs policy that leverages development opportunities and well-being o f
Mexicans living in the country and abroad. Consolidation and strengthening o f
democracy, modernization o f the political system including enhancing more direct
citizen involvement, transparency and accountability, as w e l l as the promotion o f
international trade and investment, the protection o f Mexican migrant workers
abroad and the contribution o f Mexico in the discussion and construction o f
solutions to global issues are some o f the prominent themes in this pillar.

33.
Each chapter or pillar o f the NDP has a l i s t o f numerous objectives and more
detailed strategies for achieving those objectives. The plan represents an ambitious
development program that requires substantial and complementary efforts across the
spectrum o f government ministries and agencies along with the collaboration o f state and
local authorities.

13

Box 1: Mexico and the International Development Agenda
Over the years, Mexico has made important contributions to the international development agenda. Mexico
was the host country for the Monterrey Conference o n Financing for Development, and Mexico’s Secretary
o f Finance i s currently Chairman o f the Development Committee o f the Bretton Woods’ institutions. There
are numerous cases where Mexico has had a leadership role in the design o f development solutions with
international impacts. Examples include: the Progresa-Oportunidades conditional cash transfer program,
Mexico’s innovative use o f “Cat Bonds” for mitigating risks f r o m natural disasters, and Mexico’s
leadership in global climate change issues.

E. PRINCIPLES OF BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT
34.
Mexico has made great strides in economic and social development over the last
two decades. However, the benefits o f this progress have not been shared equally. As
such, sharp income differences continue to divide the country. The policy notes
publication called this the “two worlds” within Mexico. These differences reveal the
substantial development challenges that the country still faces. In addition, global
challenges add to the development agenda, ranging from international competitiveness to
climate change. To create a partnership to meet these challenges, the Bank needs to draw
on all its roles: lending, advisory services and convening power.

35.
Based on client feedback and the Mexican authorities’ desire to maintain a strong
relationship with the Bank, the CPS identifies the following principles o f engagement.
The Bank’s support will be based on:
0

Flexibility. In keeping with the M I C strategy, the Bank and the Government have
discussed a CPS whose composition and instruments o f support would reflect
Mexico’s developmental and financial needs.
Experience from the
implementation o f the last CPS and feedback from the government indicate the
need for increasingly flexible lending and non-lending services to adapt to
emerging opportunities during the coming years.
Fast Response. The partnership strategy i s predicated on strengthening the
Bank’s ability to respond rapidly to the changing demands o f the Government.
Recently, the Bank’s AAA activities have shifted to more quick response policy
notes and other forms o f on-demand services, including fee-based services.

0

Selectivity. The choice o f instruments for Bank Group support will be driven
primarily by client demand. The instruments will be aligned with the diagnosis o f
long term development challenges discussed above. I t should be noted that the
Bank would not be engaged in areas o f the government’s NDP that are not under
the mandate o f the Bank Group as an international organization.

0

Competitive IBRD Pricing. Figure 1 displayed that the Mexican government’s
borrowing costs has declined over time. Current market conditions and the IBRD
pricing reform approved in September 2007 place the cost o f borrowing from the

14

Bank significantly below the government’s external borrowing cost (i.e., about
100 basis points).
Coordinated World Bank Group Support. IBRD and I F C programs need to
continue developing synergies for offering development solutions to Mexico, as
has recently been the case in the housing and infrastructure sectors. Packages o f
Bank Group support might mix IBRD TA with I F C financing, or joint efforts at
the state level with a m i x o f both IBRD and I F C instruments.
Box 2: Lessons Learned f r o m the CPS Completion Report.

The CPS Completion Report (Annex C) highlights the following seven key lessons learned:
-Flexibility. Implementation o f the last CPS has shown an increasing need for flexibility so as to respond
more effectively to changing circumstances and new government requests. This flexibility combined with
fast responsiveness i s a key factor for the Bank’s effectiveness in Mexico.
-Timing. The Bank should align the time-frame o f the country strategy with the electoral cycle to better
ensure policy continuity during program implementation. That would have the additional advantage o f
aligning the time-frame o f the CPS with the national development plan.
-Competitive Pricing. The Bank should communicate clearly in Mexico that i t has been and continues to
be a price-competitive source o f foreign exchange finance. The Bank should also make f i l l use o f recently
introduced, streamlined and lower-cost lending instruments in designing its lending program.’
-Results monitoring. In MICs such as Mexico, the Bank should acknowledge that CPS outcomes primarily
reflect the efforts o f the Government and the country.

-Role of AAA. Where applicable, the symbiotic role o f AAA and lending should continue to be used in
Mexico as a framework for developing a more complete program o f Bank support.
-Fiduciary Aspects. The Bank should continue on streamlining i t s contracting and procurement
requirements and should incorporate country systems to the extent possible.
-International coordination. The Bank should work closely with other international agencies in i t s
momam o f assistance to Mexico.

F. STREAMLINED APPROACH TO IBRD FINANCIAL SUPPORT

36.
T o implement these principles and to respond to client demand, the Bank needs to
enhance i t s delivery o f knowledge services. T o facilitate this process, the Bank proposes
streamlining IBRD financial support by anchoring most lending in a large annual DPL
that supports the government’s overall development strategy, accompanied by an
enhanced package o f non-lending services. The Bank also proposes to continue
environmental investment loans (given their link to parallel grant financing), and
financing at the state level. Figure 6 provides a schematic o f the streamlined program.

Rationale for the Streamlined Approach. The rationale for moving to a
37.
streamlined approach i s based o n particular characteristics o f Mexico: (a) an established
track record o f sound macroeconomic management; (b) substantial remaining long term
development challenges - sustainable and equitable growth; (c) continued demand for
World Bank Group engagement in a broad policy dialogue and specific, focused advisory
services; (d) competitive access to finance and superior debt management; and (e) the
“non-additionality” o f Bank project ‘financing to sectoral ministry budgets. The new
streamlined approach focuses Bank resources on an enhanced program of non-lending
services while minimizing both the financial and non-financial costs of borrowing from

IBRD .

38.
In terms o f the Bank’s financial services to Mexico, there i s a challenge to
provide this financing at competitive interest rates, currently at about LIBOR flat, as well
as a competitive maturity. Reducing the Bank’s own administrative costs for loan
preparation and supervision would increase the resources available to provide an
expanded set o f advisory services. These objectives could be achieved by:

(i)

Streamlining the bulk of lending into an annual Development Policv Loan

(DPL) that supports the government’s own national development
priorities; and

(ii) Leveraging w a n t resources which are concentrated in the environmental
sector in the case o f Mexico, hrther reducing the overall cost o f
borrowing.

39.

Structure of the Streamlined Approach. The large annual DPL would be multisector and would follow the operational guidelines for such loans: a focus o n the
government’s own reform program (e.g., National Development Program) with a set o f
prior actions. In parallel, the Bank and the government would reach agreement on a
complementary set o f advisory services that would support the government’s
development program.

16

40.
A second track o f lending could be developed, based on government demand. For
example, there is interest in environmental investment loans that would attract cofinancing o f grant resources, and there is potential for lending at the subnational level.
Strategic selectivity will be applied, in consultation with the government, in order to
maintain the intent o f streamlining the overall lending program.
Enhanced advisory and analytic activities (AAA). With the release o f additional
41.
bank budget for AAA, there will be a focus on assuring that AAA i s closely aligned with
the policies and actions that are critical to the government’s own development strategy.
O n a sector basis, one instrument that will be explored i s annual memoranda o f
understanding (MOUs) that lay out the annual work program o f AAA. In general, the
idea i s that the MOUs would draw on all the various TA roles that the Bank has to offer:
(i)
strategic studies, (ii)
on demandfast response policy advice, (iii)
permanent long-term
advisory role, (iv) convening power, (v) monitoring and evaluation o f polices and
programs, and (vi) implementation support. In addition, it expected that fee-based
services will continue to have an important role (see B o x 3).
Box 3: Fee-Based Services in Mexico
Mexico has been a leading consumer o f many o f the new products and services that the Bank has
developed. One o f these i s fee-based knowledge services, a product that has been increasingly employed in
Mexico since 2003. Seven products are being delivered in FY08 under fee-based contracts. Contracts have
covered such diverse themes as core public adrmnistration reforms Ministry o f Finance, housing, transport,
poverty monitoring, investment climate reforms (in Mexico City, provided jointly with the IFC) and statelevel planning (in the state o f Guerrero). The steady increase in the provision o f fee-based services has been
client-driven and i s indicative o f the client’s appreciation for the breadth and depth o f international
experience that the Bank i s able to bring t o the table. Looking ahead, the Bank will work with the
government towards developing a countrywide framework agreement to reduce the transactions costs
associated with individual contracts. In addition, the Bank Group will work with the government to use the
fee-based services product more strategically, packaging these services, where possible, with the expanded
advisory services proposed under this CPS.

42.
Transition arrangements, In the interest o f continuity, the existing plans for
calendar year 2008 lending and AAA would continue. A proposed DPL (with a Deferred
Drawdown Option) o f $500 million to support the government’s climate change strategy
accompanies this CPS. This proposed loan anchors the transition to the new streamlined
approach.
43.
Lending Volumes. For the period April 2008 to end 2010, a base IBRD lending
program o f $2.4 billion i s planned. The annual lending program o f $800 million may be
adjusted depending upon IBRD pricing competitiveness and evolving market conditions.
The lending amounts for the remainder o f the CPS period will the determined at the time
o f the CPS Progress Report, scheduled for FY11. Additional lending to states and/or
municipalities could materialize, depending upon subnational client demands, market
conditions for subnational debt and institutional arrangements for multilateral lending to
subnational governments.

17

$4.

Exposure management. Instead, overall exposure will be monitored consistent
with Bank's credit risk management. Following a prepayment in late 2006, IBRD
:xposure was reduced substantially and now stands at about $4.5 billion. This level o f
:xposure i s about one-third the peak level reached in the mid-1990s and less than half the
:eve1 o f exposure during the 2000-05 period. These levels o f exposure and gross
lisbursements represent a very small share o f national output. The figures below show
:hat projected exposure levels over 2008-2010. The projected new levels o f exposure and
lisbursementsrepresent a very small share o f national GDP.

Mexico and the Bank's New Financial Instruments. Mexico has been a leader
.n working with the Bank on new financial instruments. It was the first country to take
idvantage o f the Bank's local currency financing. The government o f Mexico's "CAT
bond" issuance has served as the inspiration for a multi-country C A T bond arrangement
that the Bank is organizing with the participation o f Mexico. A proposed DPL-DDO to
the support the government's climate change strategy i s presented to the Board jointly
with this CPS, making Mexico one o f the first countries to take advantage o f the new
terms for DDOs. The government is in frequent consultations with the Bank's Treasury
department on the development o f innovative modalities for IBRD banking products.

G. PORTFOLIO AND FIDUCIARY CONSIDERATIONS

46.
As o f January 31, 2008, Mexico's IBRD portfolio consisted o f 14 investment
projects under implementation for a net commitment o f $1.54 billion, o f which $667
million remained undisbursed. The latter represents a significant decrease during the
previous CPS period, resulting from the fact o f having only minimal new investment
lending $65 million) between April 2006 and March 2008. In addition, 5 GEF grants
($128 million) were under implementation. The disbursement ratio on investment
projects was 36 percent and realism ratio was 67 for the first half o f FY08. There were
four projects at risk (including one GEF), o f which three were problem projects whose
net commitments were equal to 19 percent o f the total net commitment amount. Steps are

18

being taken to bring all the projects out o f problem status by the end o f FY08, with
cancellation being considered in one case. Further details on the current Bank and IFC
M and N.
portfolios in Mexico can be found in Annexes E, F, G, H, I,

47.
Looking ahead, the annual portfolio review process (CPPR) will be adjusted in
two ways: (i)
to have a greater results focus; and (ii)
to incorporate AAA products. The
enhanced results focus was specifically requested by the Secretariat o f Finance (SHCP)
during the 2007 CPPR. The incorporation o f AAA would be consistent with the new
business model which will result in AAA products outnumbering lending products. This
annual review o f AAA, prepared and implemented within a CPPR framework, would also
add an element o f quality control that may be especially needed for relatively
unstructured tasks such as fee-based or just-in-time services. The C M U will work
closely with the client and the regional Operations Services unit to design an appropriate
mechanism for such a results-based review.
48.
Fiduciary and Safeguards Systems. The Bank will continue to work with the
government to improve fiduciary and safeguards systems within Bank-financed projects
and in the public sector generally. Mexico has well-hnctioning PFM systems, but s t i l l
lags behind OECD-type practices, particularly at the subnational level. The Bank's
engagement has progressively shifted from project-specific support to helping to improve
country-level systems and the government's demand for the latter has increased, thus
opening opportunities for demand drivedfast response policy advice and implementation
support. The Bank can also use its convening power to organize highly-targeted
workshops to share international experiences in these areas. Analogous opportunities
exist with respect to social and environmental safeguards. The Bank has had a long
engagement with Mexico in these areas, directly supported by analytical work and
including on-going assistance to CFE and CONAGUA to help them strengthen their
institutional capacity with respect to strategic environmental and social assessments.
While Mexico's systems in these areas are sophisticated, there i s still room for
improvement. Accordingly, the Bank intends to continue i t s dialogue with the
government to explore possible government demand for AAA in these areas. Further
information on fiduciary issues can be found in Annex D.
49.
IFC's Investment Portfolio. Mexico i s currently IFC's ninth largest exposure in
terms o f commitments for IFC's account only, representing about 3 percent o f IFC's
portfolio worldwide. The outstanding portfolio stood at $719 million (including $606
million for IFC's account and $1 13 million for syndications). Financial markets,
manufacturing and infrastructure accounted for 63, 14 and 13 percent o f the outstanding
portfolio, respectively.

H. STRATEGIC AREAS FOR THE IFC AND COORDINATION ACROSS
THE WORLD BANK GROUP
50.
Mexico has recently signed an agreement to j o i n MIGA and i s currently in the
process o f becoming a full member o f the Agency. W h e n this process i s completed,
Mexico will be able to take full advantage o f all the instruments and services that the
World Bank Group offers to i t s members, and to expand i t s strategy o f engagement with
the Group.
5 1.
IFC’s priority areas in the Bank Group’s Private Sector Strategy in the 2004 CPS,
and reaffirmed in the FY07 CAS Progress Report, included (i)
broadening and deepening
o f the financial sector - with a focus on reaching out to lower income segments o f the
society ; (ii)
promoting investments in areas newly opened to private sector participation
(infrastructure, social services, municipalities, and energy); (iii)
enhancing international
competitiveness o f the private sector (improving the Business Enabling Environment BEE); (iv) promoting sustainable environmental and social development and good
corporate governance (CG)..

52.
Broadening and deepening the financial sector. IFC has focused on supporting
locally-sponsored banks and other institutions to extend the reach o f financial services to
lower income levels o f the population while promoting the sustainability o f capital
markets. Particular focus areas have included mortgage financing, tier I1banks, private
equity funds, the savings and credit sector (which seeks to expand banking access to
more poor people), SMEs and microfinance. In terms o f the housing finance market,
from 2004 to present, I F C has directly addressed the funding needs o f specialized lending
institutions such as the housing Sofoles, and fostered the expansion o f alternative sources
o f funding and the development o f the secondary mortgage market in the country in light
o f the transition o f SHF from direct lender to guarantor. In the future, cooperation
between the IFC and IBRD will be targeted to: increasing access to funding for nontraditional players in the financial sector, spreading affordable housing and housing
finance products to lower income/remotely located segments o f the population, and to
fostering sustainable environmental practices in the construction o f the housing stock,
such as the joint IFC/SHF Green Mortgages Project.
53.
Infrastructure. Supporting the government’s national infrastructure plan will be
a priority for the Bank Group’s strategy. Collaboration between the IFC and lBRD will
be the basis for becoming a knowledge institution for middle income countries l i k e
Mexico. By combining the transaction experience and the knowledge o f the private
sector that the IFC has, with the sector knowledge o f the BRD, innovative solutions and
structures could be delivered to Mexico, helping not only to increase the coverage o f
public services by bringing private participation, but also by increasing the quality and
efficiency o f the sectors served. A co-advisory collaboration between IFC’ and NAFIN
will bring to Mexico all the benefits o f the IFC-IBRD collaboration and the transaction

20

process expertise to be absorbed by a Mexican institution. Under this approach there i s an
opportunity for co-advising the State o f Yucatan for a health project
54.
Quality o f the Health Sector. IFC’s support to the health sector results in an
increased supply o f high quality and affordable health care services to the general public
On the investment side, IFC i s supporting private health suppliers in their expansion
programs and the creation o f new capacity for specialized services with limited supply
from the public sector. In terms o f advisory services, the IFC recently signed an advisory
mandate with the State o f Mexico to implement a PPP transaction for two new secondary
public hospitals that would serve 100,000 patients annually. IFC i s also in discussions
with two other states.
55.
Strengthening the Investment Climate The IBRD and IFC will explore
possibilities for collaboration in advisory work to improve the business environment, in
particular at the state and local level. These efforts go hand-in-hand with efforts to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f public sector institutions at the state and local
level. In addition, the multi-sector capacity o f the IBRD can be leveraged with business
process simplification expertise in the IFC to offer state and local governments a rather
complete package o f advisory services.
56.
Good Corporate Governance IFC has created a Senior Advisory Board,
conformed by nine Mexican business leaders, to foster the adoption o f best corporate
governance practices by medium-sized family-owned companies and to promote
corporate governance within society. IFC has been promoting the agenda together with
the Centro de Excelencia en Gobierno Corporativo and the Mexican Stock Exchange.
IFC held the first Corporate Governance roundtable o f L A C countries in Mexico in
March, 2007.
57.
Past and Ongoing IBRD-IFC Collaboration in Advisory Services. IBRD and
IFC have worked closely in a number o f areas to support private sector development and
public-private partnerships for government service delivery. W h i l e many o f these efforts
involve federal government agencies, a significant share o f this work has been at the
subnational level. Examples o f these collaborative efforts include the following:

*:

Business Enabling Environment (BEE). The IFC and IBRD worked jointly on
(fee based) advisory services in the Federal District for simplifjmg
government administrative processes and ease the administrative burden on
local businesses. This line o f work has expanded to more IFC contracts.

*:

Advisorv Services in Infrastructure. Recent collaborative activities include:
study on road concessions, advice to the State o f Mexico on health sector PPP,
advice to BANOBRAS on strategic directions, advice on sector policy reform
for the toll highways, design o f the Metrobus project in the Federal District,
and advice on the legal framework for PPPs in the Federal District. IFC and
IBRD are currently working together to analyze the existing road concession
program and provide recommendations o n ways to improve it to help attract
more private sector participation.
21

*:*

Advisorv Services in Access to Finance. IBRD staff has collaborated on I F C
initiatives to develop the mortgage market to broader segments o f the
population and in SME finance initiatives as well.

The streamlined approach to IBRD lending would present opportunities to adjust
and broaden IBRD/IFC collaboration in Mexico. First, the Memoranda o f Understanding
(MOUs) for analytic and advisory activities (Mcould
) potentially incorporate services
from both the IBRD and I F C sector specialists. I t i s also likely that reforms and
investments to improve private sector development will be incorporated within the large
DPLs in fbture years.
58.

During the transition to this approach, IBRD has a number o f ongoing loans and
activities that can have positive impacts on the private sector environment in which IFC’s
clients operate. For example, the tax administration project i s helping to lower the costs
o f compliance with tax obligations. In infiastructure, IBRD i s providing advisory
services o n toll roads and logistics collaboration with the IFC. In the financial sector,
there is ongoing advisory work on competition in the banking system, micro-finance and
micro-insurance and reform o f development banks. Housing finance has been supported
by DPL loans - the most recent disbursed late in 2007, and there is an ongoing TA loan
that continues in this support. Substantial collaboration between the IBRD and I F C has
been a key factor in this work.

59.

The IFC has a broad array o f ongoing activities and new projects in the pipeline
60.
which range from the financial sector to health, agriculture and tourism. Advisory
services will also remain a focus o f fbture work, including substantial BEE work.

Future support to Mexico’s private sector will exploit synergies across the World
61.
Bank Group. Many o f the ideas for future collaboration build upon ongoing activities.
Annex B provides a more in-depth discussion o f how IBRD and I F C are currently
working to support Mexico’s private sector, and possible areas o f future collaboration.

I.CONSULTATIONS AND CLIENT SURVEY
62.
Consultations o n the role and the fbture engagement o f the World Bank in Mexico
were conducted in November. Consultations involved political, economic and opinion
leaders, representatives o f the three biggest political parties (PRI, PRD, PAN), business
leaders at the federal and local levels, legislative representatives, members o f the
academia, state and municipal governments, and non-governmental organizations. l5 A
client survey complemented these consultations (see Box 4).The consultations all
confirmed the need for the Bank to stay engaged but also to build a more dynamic
relationship through the provision o f flexible, on-demand services, active
dialogue/outreach to the sub-national levels, and better communications.
15

Meetings took place in Guadalajara, Monterrey, Ciudad Juarez and the Federal District (Mexico City).

22

Box 4: Results of the Client Survey
The Bank’s client survey was conducted between October-November, 2007, with a response rate o f 45
percent (about 275 participants). Participants stated that the three m a i n development priorities for the
country are: promoting economic growth, reducing poverty and increasing equity o f opportunities. In
addition, a large majority o f participants identified education as the most important contribution to growth.
Perceptions of the Bank are generally positive. The survey findings suggest that while the Bank i s
perceived positively (in terms of i t s expertise, i t s relationships, inclusion, collaboration, and i t s
effectiveness), 57 percent o f a l l respondents felt that the Bank should b e more involved in Mexico’s
development strategies.
Recommended areas of engagement. Respondents would like the Bank t o focus o n (i)
poverty reduction,
(ii)growth, (iii)
education, and (iv) sub-national governments, especially the southern states. In terms o f
engagement, they would l i k e the Bank to be more flexible and t o deliver solutions in a more timely fashion.
Related to Mexico as a MIC, respondents would welcome the Bank t o develop more innovative knowledge
products (and to a smaller degree, financial products); to allow for greater leaming opportunities between
M I C s and OECD countries, and expand local currency financing.
The Bank should emphasize knowledge transfer and solution of complex chqllenges. Although
respondents did not rule out that in the medium term the Bank will s t i l l play a significant role as a provider
o f financial solutions to Mexico, they see i t more as a provider o f technical assistance, analytical and
advisory services as w e l l as o f solutions/options in complex development challenges.

J. RESULTS MONITORING

63.
The Mexico CPS contains a strong orientation toward achieving realistic
outcomes and a results-oriented monitoring and evaluation system. However, developing
a results framework that specifies expected linkages between the Bank’s interventions
and long t e r m development goals for a flexible program o f support such as that described
in the Mexico CPS i s a challenge. This i s partly because o f the relatively small scale o f
the Bank’s financial support relative to GDP. The CPS envisions IBRD lending that
often leverages Bank expertise in areas which the Government has identified as a major
priority and to which it i s committing substantial resources (e.g. innovation, tertiary
education). I t i s also because o f the nature o f the Bank’s evolving role as a knowledge
partner. An important share o f the Bank’s support under the CPS will be AAA and
advisory services, the evaluation o f which presents inherent difficulties. This is
especially true in Mexico, where the Government i s requesting support on a “real-time”
basis, and often for input to the policy process, in which the authorities are drawing o n
multiple sources o f advice, and not, in every case, t o the formulation or implementation
o f the policies themselves. This fluidity in demand, and the fact that the program will be
fully defined only in its later years following ongoing dialogue, makes an ex ante
identification o f inputs and results difficult.
64.
In this context, the CPS seeks to meet the core objective o f a results-based
Country Strategy by presenting a results framework that establishes relationships between
interventions and outcomes; contains measurable indicators; and describes arrangements
for collection, analysis, and use o f data to monitor results, while pragmatically reflecting

23

the nature o f the Bank’s business in Mexico. The results framework will evolve over
time during CPS implementation, and i t will be updated at the time o f the CPS Progress
Report. Annex A details the Results Matrix.

J. R I S K S

Domestic

65.

Social Cohesion. Persistent inequality can undermine organized political
decision-making processes, resulting in difficulties in reaching consensus o n key policy
reforms. The government i s working to mitigate this risk through intensive dialogue with
the main political parties and key representatives in Congress.

66.
Competitiveness. Sluggish growth performance and limited employment
opportunities may occur i f reforms are not enacted to enhance competitiveness. An
example o f the degree o f risk i s the fact that total factor productivity has been relatively
flat over the last quarter century. The ambitious national infrastructure plan and potential
regulatory actions in the coming years could help mitigate this risk.
67.
Natural calamities. Mexico i s susceptible to seismic risks and substantial losses
due to hurricanes and other storms. The latter may intensify due to climate change and
instead o f as the impacts may be surprisingly near-term. Another risk associated with
natural resources i s water depletion in arid zones - the major centers o f economic
production. The government i s working on programs to contain catastrophic risks.
External

68.
Global Economic Environment and the U S Economy. Despite the important
measures implemented in recent years to protect the economy from external shocks,
Mexico remains sensitive to regional and global developments. Government debt
exposure in foreign currency has been reduced and flexible exchange rate with inflation
targeting in place. The high degree o f correlation with the U S economy implies that if a
“hard landing” were to occur in the United States, Mexico’s economy would be strongly
impacted. Mexico continues to seek free trade agreements with other countries, and
exports to non-US destinations have been dynamic in recent years. The government has
lowered the government’s exposure to foreign currency risks and the central bank has
implemented a flexible exchange rate policy, both o f which help mitigate risks arising
from the global economic environment.

24

CPS Implementation
69.
Finally, there are risks associated with the new approach to Bank Group
assistance that this CPS represents. One risk i s that Mexico may simply curtail i t s
borrowing from the Bank (as it has done in the past) and hence jeopardize the Bank's
overall program o f technical assistance and continued relevance. A second r i s k i s that the
overall progress in the government's National Development Plan i s less than satisfactory
to support a large annual DPL. If the first risk is realized, i t i s likely that the non-lending
program would have to be reduced and an even higher degree o f selectivity introduced
into non-lending services - or fee-based services could be scaled up. If the second risk i s
realized, there are several options: the loan amounts o f the annual D P L could be reduced,
the program redefined and narrowed to an area where the policy dialogue and reform
progress i s more promising, or the DPL program could be substituted or complemented
by more sectorally focused investment lending.

Annex B: Private Sector Strategy
A. Background
1.
Private sector development i s at the core o f the development challenges facing
Mexico. The National Development Plan’s objective to promote sustainable human
development requires the creation o f quality jobs. For j o b creation and worker productivity,
an enabling environment for businesses to operate and invest i s essential. Private investment
in Mexico would need to be higher in order to sustain faster growth. W h i l e the economy has
recovered f i o m the debilitating effects o f the series o f economic crises total factor
productivity still lags the rates o f growth achieved in earlier periods o f Mexican development
and the top productivity performers internationally.

Agenda for Growth and Employment.

2.
The private sector agenda can be separated into four pillars: business climate; human
capital; infrastructure; and financial sector.

B. The World Bank Group’s Support During the Last CPS

3.

The CPS Completion Report (Annex C) provides an overview o f World Bank Group
activities in recent years. The text below i s an edited excerpt fiom the review o f the activities
under the pillar o f growth and competitiveness.

Analytic Underpinnings: Programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA

4.
The Bank’s programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had its origins in an
earlier collaboration with the Government on issues o f competitiveness. The Bank worked
with the Office o f the President to assist the Government in defining a national

29

Competitiveness Agenda 2004-06. The success o f this assistance led to the elaboration o f the
Programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA for FY05-FY08, which sought to broaden
the dialogue on competitiveness to stakeholders beyond the executive and the private sector.
5.

The four year programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA was initially structured

in three phases. The first phase has supported the design and implementation o f the Mexican
Competitiveness Agenda.
The aim was not to produce an analytical piece on

competitiveness, but to fill some key knowledge gaps that were necessary for the
Competitiveness Agenda and to provide non-lending technical assistance to move the agenda
forward. The second phase brings key policy messages into the public sphere. Policy Notes
have also served that objective.
6.
A report was published for both the first and second phases o f the programmatic
AAA. The two-volume first phase report, Mexico ’s Challenge of Knowledge-based
Competitiveness: Challenges and Opportunities, argued that Mexico had to act now to take
advantage o f the opportunities arising from the knowledge revolution. The second phase
report, Mexico ’s Competitiveness: Reaching I t s Potential, informed policy makers, the
private sector, and the public at large about competitiveness priorities and shortcomings. The
focus was on measures to enhance Mexico’s efficiency, generate jobs, and move the country
an
to a more innovation-driven stage o f development. Focused analytic pieces included: (i)
assessment o f the quality o f infrastructure and key weaknesses o f the Mexican innovation
system; (ii)
an assessment o f the draft labor law reform and its likely impact on indicators for
Doing Business; (iii)
a study o f logistics costs and bottlenecks and (iv) an analysis o f the
impact o f tariff reforms on trade. The Bank has held discussions and briefings with major
policymakers and stakeholders and has contributed to the competitiveness strategy o f two
state development plans. I t has also made a series o f presentations to the new Senate
Committee on Competitiveness.
7.
The programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had a number o f positive
impacts. The collaboration with the Government has been largely successful. The more
focused analytical pieces were well-regarded by public officials, particularly for bringing an
international perspective to the challenges faced by Mexico. More broadly, an important
contribution o f the Bank was perceived to be i t s role in facilitating a consensus on the need
for reforms. The success o f this work led to the approval o f the first Competitiveness DPL in
FY05. That loan supported measures to enhance transparency and improve the regulatory
framework to enhance competitiveness.
Business Climate

8.
There has been an improvement in business registration. Rapid Business Opening
Systems have facilitated new entry in 74 municipalities, although this has not yet led to a
reduction in the average number o f days to register a business nationwide. FIAS carried out
“Doing Business” analysis in twelve cities in Mexico in 2005, and in 31 cities and states in
2007. IFC has undertaken pilot programs to simplify business registration and licensing at
the municipal level. In addition, the Bank, with the participation o f IFC, i s offering fee-forservice advice in the area o f investment climate reform for the Federal District. That effort
will continue to focus on the procedures for opening a business. The state o f Guerrero i s

30

currently working with IFC in improving the investment climate through a partial fee for
service. The creation o f the Senate Competitiveness Committee, to which the Bank made a
series o f presentations, has helped promote reforms to increase Mexico’s competitiveness.
Complementing the regulatory agenda, WBI has fostered a dialogue with over 500 business
representatives through the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability
Competitiveness Course.
Human Capital

9.
The Government has made progress on i t s agenda for innovation and education to
make the workforce more competitive. Building on the 2002 new legal framework, Mexico
has established 25 science and technology councils at the state level. The number o f
researchers in the national research system (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNI) has
increased from 7,466 in 2000 to 12,096 in 2005, growing at an annual average rate o f 10
percent. Public funding to SNI increased by 13.5 percent in 2005, representing a quarter o f
CONACYTs budget. The Bank has been supporting these efforts through the Innovation for
Competitiveness APL I (FY 06) which aims to consolidate ongoing sector reforms in science
and technology by strengthening programs for business innovation and human capital
development. That includes: (i)
promoting business innovation; (ii)
financing scholarships;
and (iii)supporting policies to strengthen the framework for science, technology and
innovation and foster international linkages. Other Bank loans supporting education will
boost long-run competitiveness by training a more skilled workforce. IFC has been
supporting this pillar with nine operations for a total o f $125 million in the education, health
and micro-credit sectors. In education, IFC’s financing i s supporting the expansion o f
Mexico’s second largest private sector university with a particular focus on attending middle
and lower-middle class segments o f the population. It i s also supporting a new sofol focused
on student loans. The three health sector operations are supporting hospital services in
Guadalajara and Tampico awhile the three micro-credit operations are supporting institutions
whose main clients are low-income women.
Infrastructure

10.
Significant advances have been made in the provision o f roads, electricity, and water,
though gaps persist in poor, rural and indigenous communities. The Bank has been
supporting efforts to expand the coverage and quality o f roads through the Decentralized
Infrastructure Development Loan (FY04, US$108 million), a state level loan which provides
financing to the State o f Guanajuato to strengthen its infrastructure strategy and planning.
Progress has been satisfactory. The Bank also furnished technical assistance related to
highway finance reform and i s providing advice on a fee-for-service basis for the institutional
reform o f toll roads. Additional support to the infrastructure sector was provided through the
Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review (FY05), which analyzed the effectiveness and
efficiency o f public infrastructure spending in water supply and sanitation, transport and
electricity.
11.
During the CPS period, IFC supported Government efforts to encourage investments
in infrastructure with the participation o f the private sector. IFC provided financing totaling
US$126.6 million (including US$50 million in equity and US$11 million for syndications)

31

for innovative infrastructure projects. Support was furnished to one o f the first PPP road
projects in Mexico and to a company interested in investing in future PPP projects, to a
newly established affordable airline carrier, and to a recycling company.
Box 2. IFC support for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
In 2002 IFC funded and assisted “Partnerships”, the UK technical assistance initiative to the Mexican
authorities for the development o f a Public-Private Partnership program. The PPP program benefits f r o m
both public and private sector expertise and i s critical for the public services needs o f Mexico, such as
infrastructure, healthcare and education. I F C has provided advisory and technical assistance t o the government
in coordination with IBRD while, o n the other hand, engaging with private sector companies interested in a PPP
contract for specific projects. In FY07, I F C furnished a US$12 m i l l i o n equivalent partial guarantee in support
o f the first project concessioned to the private sector under the program. That project consisted o f the
expansion, upgrading, operation and maintenance o f a 74.3 km road between the cities o f Irapuato and L a
Piedad de Cabadas in the State o f Guanajuato. The participation o f IFC helped t o allay risks in project
implementation and reassured the market that the project was bankable. The project is likely to have a
demonstration effect for future concession contracts.

Financial Sector

12.
Mexico has made great strides towards consolidating the financial sector and has
introduced reforms to increase competition. Since the first debt crisis o f 1982 and the effects
o f the financial crisis o f 1994-95, Mexico has gone through a long process o f financial sector
restructuring and consolidation. Growth o f the financial sector is accelerating with increased
competition. In the banking sector, there i s s t i l l a need for changes to the Credit Institutions
Law. In the non-banking sector there i s a need to deregulate Sofoles and adjust the laws
relating to trust, insurance and pension funds. In the bond market, new debt instruments are
making it easier to obtain financing by issuing domestic debt, while the Securities Law
passed in December 2006 i s expected to improve the functioning o f the stock market. The
main Bank instrument for support to the financial sector was the Finance and Growth DPL
(FY06). That operation supported a series o f financial sector reforms, including the
securities Law and strengthened oversight by corporate boards. This DPL replaced the
Access to Financial Services project originally planned for FY07 in the CPS. The 2006
update to the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) provided analytical support to
other reforms, including the Banking Resolution Law. In FY08, the SHCP has asked the
Bank to undertake a study o f competition in the banking sector. The principal findings o f the
study, which covered such topics as the performance o f development banks, access to finance
by SMEs, and micro-insurance, were subsequently incorporated into policy notes prepared
for the incoming Calderon administration.
13.
The Bank Group has also supported access to financial services by sectors
underserved by commercial banks. The US$505.1 million Rural Finance SAL (FY03)
supported the liquidation o f Banrural and the creation o f Financiera Rural, a decentralized
financial institution in charge o f promoting the development o f rural financial markets and
lending to small and medium rural producers. The project also supported the Government’s
broader goal o f reducing the fiscal drain o f loss-making banks, while enhancing access to
financial services for sectors not served by commercial banks. According to an IEG
evaluation, as a result o f the project, the Government has made major inroads in reforming
the rural finance market and in restructuring the financial sector. IEG rated the project highly

32

satisfactory. The second phase o f the Savings and Rural Finance Project (BANSEFI) has
helped the Government strengthen more than 400 local savings and credit institutions and
place them o n a sound financial footing, thereby affording many low-income families with
access to financial services that they would otherwise not enjoy.
14.
I F C has complemented Bank assistance in the financial sector with support in a total
amount o f US$578.8 million over the period FY05-08 for mortgages (including
securitization), microfinance, banks, trade, and private equity funds. Making use o f advisory
services when appropriate, I F C focused o n promoting access to financial services for
underserved retail entities while, in the case o f the corporate sector, helping increase the
access o f M S M E s to debt and equity finance. In addition, I F C helped develop the market for
education finance by investing in a sole-purpose dedicated financial institution (Sofol) that
specializes in the education sector.
15.
The housing finance market has expanded rapidly in recent years. The Federal
Mortgage Agency, SHF, has fostered the development o f Sofoles, special purpose, nondeposit private credit institutions, and has established the legal and regulatory framework for
a flourishing secondary mortgage market. The Bank supported the strengthening and
expansion o f the private mortgage market through the F O V I Restructuring project (US$505.1
million, approved FY99), which extended support to the Banking Finance Fund for Housing
(FOVI) and to i t s successor institution the SHF. The I C R for this operation listed many
accomplishments including assisting a program o f mortgage lending from 2000 to 2005 that
financed some 290,000 mortgages for a total value o f US$7 billion equivalent. Since 2004,
the SHF has supported asset-backed securities with guarantees for timely payment.
16.
I F C has provided funding and technical assistance to housing sector Sofoles and other
mortgage providers, and i t has continued to facilitate the development o f a secondary
mortgage market development. IFC support has included remittance-backed mortgages,
warehousing lines, partial credit guarantees and technical and advisory assistance. Since the
SHF i s scheduled to stop direct finding for Sofoles in the coming years, IFC’s efforts have
been geared towards enabling Sofoles to seek funding from the market o n their o w n account
and continue providing affordable mortgages to Mexican homeowners.
C. Key areas of opportunity for WBG Support Moving Forward

17.
Following a transition period, the streamlined approach to IBRD lending would
suggest that the focus o f IBRD work would be to establish Memoranda o f Understanding
(MOU) with key government agencies involved in the private sector enabling environment.
These M O U s would provide basis for continued analytic and advisory activities (AAA). I t i s
also likely that reforms and investments to improve private sector development will be
considered under the single DPL in future years. I F C would continue i t s financial support
for selected high impact f i r m s and continue with analytic work l i k e the municipal scorecard
and advisory services related to the business enabling environment (BEE). I t i s expected that
there will be increasing collaboration between IBRD and I F C o n advisory services.
During the transition to this approach, IBRD has a number o f ongoing loans and
18.
activities. In terms o f the business climate, the IBRD is in the latter stages o f preparing a

33

loan that would support start-up f i r m s in business process outsourcing and other information
technology focused activities. A tax administration project i s also helping to lower the costs
o f compliance with tax obligations. Poverty analysis - in a fee-based service - i s also
moving towards understanding income generation for the poor and the functioning o f labor
markers. Finally, there i s currently a DPL series for competitiveness, where one loan was
already prepared and disbursed. In human capital development, there i s ongoing lending for
education quality nationally along with substantial analytic and advisory support to the
Secretariat o f Education. To improve the links between human capital development and
business innovation, the IBRD i s financing programs in the national science and technology
council (CONACYT). In infrastructure, IBRD i s providing advisory services on toll roads
and logistics - in collaboration with the IFC-and an innovative state level infrastructure
development project in the state o f Guanajuato i s under implementation. A TA loan is also
supporting reforms and institutional development in the water sector. In the financial sector,
there is ongoing advisory work on competition in the banking system, micro-finance and
micro-insurance and reform o f development banks. There i s also a DPL series to support
financial sector reforms - with one loan prepared and disbursed (as mentioned above).
Housing finance has been supported by DPL loans - the most recent disbursed late in 2007,
and there i s an ongoing TA loan that continues in this support. Substantial collaboration
between the IBRD and IFC has been a key factor in this work.
The IFC has a broad array o f ongoing activities and new projects in the pipeline
19.
which range from the financial sector to health, agriculture and tourism. Advisory services
will also remain a focus o f future work, including substantial work in the “business enabling
environment” (BEE).
20.
A focus o f future work for private sector development i s to explore synergies across
the World Bank Group, and many o f the ideas for future collaboration build upon ongoing
activities. Some o f the possibilities are discussed in the next section.

D. Possible innovations in collaboration across the WBG
21.
IFC and IBRD have identified five areas in Mexico in which existing or potential
collaboration between IFC and IBRD could result in a major sector impact. The five areas
are:
*:*

*:*
*:

*:*
*:

Housing
Health
Infrastructure
Business Enabling Environment
Innovative Approaches to Climate Change Mitigation

In addition, collaboration i s expected to continue on financial sector issues as they
22.
cut across all these areas o f activity.

23.
Housing. IBRD and I F C have undertaken complementary efforts, working with the
public and private sectors, respectively, in the development o f a sustainable primary and
secondary housing market in Mexico. IBRD fostered and supported the creation o f Sociedud
Hipotecariu Federal (SHF) by providing direct funding to it and i t s predecessor FOVI.

34

Since then i t has worked closely with SHF, the National Hosing Commission (CONAVI) and
SEDESOL through a series o f three programmatic operations accompanied by technical
assistance to help catalyze a number o f key policy reforms in the sector. Reforms include
modification o f on-budget housing subsidies by making them better targeted and more
progressive, modernization o f property registries, development o f new housing micro finance
products for lower-income segments and the definition o f new instruments to develop urban
land markets for low-income housing. From 2004 to present, IFC has directly addressed the
funding needs o f specialized lending institutions such as the housing Sof01es;~and fostered
the expansion o f alternative sources o f funding and the development o f the secondary
mortgage market in the country in light o f the transition o f SH F from direct lender to
guarantor.

24.
In the future, cooperation between the IFC and IBRD will be targeted to: increasing
access to fhnding for non-traditional players in the financial sector, spreading affordable
housing and housing finance products to lower income/remotely located segments o f the
population, and to fostering sustainable environmental practices in the construction o f the
housing stock. The future initiatives are coordinated between IFC's Global Financial
Markets Department, the IBRD and SHF.
25.
The IFC Housing Finance Strategy in Mexico i s committed to the development o f the
housing finance market, especially for the middle and lower income segments o f the
population. The strategy contemplates three phases:
26.
Phase I.
This phase focused on 1) providing funds to specialized financial institutions
such as the housing Sofoles to support primary market origination and 2) diversifying these
Sofoles' funding sources and reliance on government loans; while supporting the
development o f a standardized mortgage market sector.
27.
Key projects in this phase are mortgage warehouse lines to housing Sofoles: Su
Casita, Hipotecaria Nacional, Credit0 y Casa, MetroJinanciera, and Hipotecaria Ve'rtice;
and construction lines to Su Casita and Hipotecaria Ve'rtice.

28.
Phase 11. This phase focuses on the development o f a sustainable secondary mortgage
market in Mexico by 1) supporting the issuance o f well structured mortgage backed
securities, 2) fostering the development o f other secondary mortgage market entities, and 3)
funding different mortgage originators including banks.
29.
Key projects: in this phase are warehouse line and enhancement facility for GMAC
Financiera, MBS CEF project, which allows IFC to enhance the M B S issuances by smaller
market players including banks.

30.
Phase 111. IFC envisages a later stage where there i s more private sector participation
in both the primary and secondary Mexican mortgage markets and the IFC intervention
idwould be very selective, focused on supporting nichelunderserved segmentshectors and

9

Sofoles are non-bank specialized financial institutions. Housing Sofoles provide loans to housing developers
and mortgage loans to individuals.

35

increasing and enhancing linkages o f the housing finance players with the capital markets via
structured finance products.
K e y projects under development and execution are the following:

31.
1.

..

11.

The advisory services program with SHF which aims to enhance operational
capacities and corporate governance o f five Sofoles. The enhanced capacity i s
expected to improve the competitiveness o f these smaller players, increase their
access to other sources o f hnding aside from SHF, and ultimately, to increase the
stock o f affordable housing products. In addition, IFC will and i s now starting to
finance some the Sofoles participating in the program, i.e. Hipotecaria Vertice.

The Joint IFC/SHF Project to build mortgage origination capacity within selected
Sociedades Cooperativas de Ahorro (SCAPS), which work in rural areas or with l o w
and informal economy population segments. The overall objective o f this project i s
to increase access to the lowest income segments, which in general have the SCAPS
as their only link to the financial system. This Project proposes to create a knowledge
sharing center to further disseminate good practices among the SCAPS and in the
medium-term to permit co-financing between SHF and I F C and fostering a secondary
market for the SCAPS generated mortgage loans.

iii.The Joint IFC/ SHF Green Mortgages Project which aims to build a Mexican Green
Mortgage "standard criteria" that include energy efficiency (EE) and renewable
energy (RE) componentshorms, with measurable benefits; and to set up a Green
Mortgage Facility (medium and long-term funding and guarantees) to be provided to
various financial institutions.
iv. IBRD Housing and Urban T A between IBRD, SHF, C O N A V I and SEDESOL which
aims to (i)
improve the equity and progressivity o f the subsidy system, (ii)
prepare a
strategic environmental assessment o f the housing sector, (iii)
increase the available
instruments to develop urban land for low-income housing, and (iv) reform the
institutional framework o f the housing and urban sectors.

32.
Health Sector. There i s an important potential for collaboration between the I F C and
IBRD in the health sector, as I F C has expanded i t s participation in the health sector o f the
country through investments and advisory services.
33.
O n the investment side IFC i s supporting private health suppliers in their expansion
programs to enhance the overall competitiveness o f the private sector and the creation o f new
capacity for specialized services with limited supply from the public sector.
Private providers o f health services are increasing their collaboration with public
34.
hospitals through service contracts with the systems for public insurance cover.
35.
There i s a significant area o f collaboration between IFC and IBRD to promote a
deeper involvement o f the private sector in the supply o f specialized services to the public
systems. The harmonization o f policies o f the different existing public systems in Mexico
36

recommended by the IBRD advisory and analytic activity will pave the way for the long term
vision o f separating the purchasing and provision fbnction. IFC and IBRD can work together
in the creation o f incentives for the private players to grow their participation in the provision
o f specialized services to Government patients.
36.
Currently, by supporting the growth o f private health providers who are already
interested in this line o f business, IFC i s aligning i t s strategy to the IBRD health sector
strategy. An example o f this i s the financing o f the Centro Midico Puerta de Hierro, a
hospital in Guadalajara who has initiated the construction o f i t s second hospital in the
Tlajomulco District, located in southern Guadalajara, Mexico. This institution i s already
working with public entities (IMSS) in the provision o f different specialized services to
Government patients. The recently financed project will create new capacity for specialized
services not available in public hospitals, like the first integrated cancer center to serve the
cities o f Guadalajara, Colima and surrounding states. Centro Mkdico Puerta de Hierro’s case
i s an example o f how private and public systems can complement each other’s infrastructure
in favor o f the population. IFC/IBRD collaboration can promote this trend.

37.
In addition, IFC’s support to the private health sector results in an increased supply o f
high quality and affordable health care services to the general public, which relieves some o f
the burden on the busy public sector facilities in a complementary fashion. By absorbing
more o f the middle-class demand, private investment allows the Government to allocate
more effort and resources to the lower socio-economic class, which results in the
improvement o f living conditions o f the population as a whole.
38.
In terms o f advisory services, the I F C recently signed an advisory mandate with the
State o f Mexico to implement a PPP transaction for two new secondary hospitals. The State
o f Mexico is facing considerable pressures regarding i t s facilities capacity and quality o f
health care for i t s population. As transaction advisor, IFC would structure a PPP solution and
implement it through a competitive tender process. The project will provide higher quality
health care for a l o w income population, attending approximately 100,000 patients per year.
The collaboration between IBRD, Investment and Advisory will result into a very valuable
offer to the State o f Mexico from the World Bank Group.
39.
In order to manage a potential conflict o f interest, the following guidelines are being
used for collaboration between investment and advisory services:

*:
*:*
*:

Coordination and synergies during the prospecting process;
Best practices sharing during the definition o f structure;
Chinese wall during the risk allocation and bidding processes.

40.
Infrastructure. Collaboration between the I F C and IBRD in the infrastructure sector
will be the basis for becoming a Knowledge Institution for middle income countries l i k e
Mexico. By combining the transaction experience and the knowledge o f the private sector
that the IFC has with the sector knowledge o f the IBRD, new solutions and structures could
be delivered to Mexico helping not only to increase the coverage o f public services by
bringing private participation, but also a new benefit by increasing the quality and efficiency
o f the sectors served.

37

Target sectors for this collaboration will be:

41.

*:*
*:*
*:*

Transportation
Health and Education
Water and Sanitation

In the Transportation sector, the IFC and IBRD are currently working together to
42.
analyze the existing road concession program and provide recommendations on ways to
improve i t to help attract more Private Sector Participation by identifying international best
practices and proposing new alternatives to increase the number o f projects delivered to the
market.

43.
In the health and education sectors, the emphasis will be at a State level; currently the
I F C i s conducting an advisory for the State o f Mexico for a new hospital. This will bring a
new scheme where the focus will be on increasing the quality and efficiencies o f the sector.
Other similar opportunities are being discussed with Yucatan and Chihuahua.
For the water and sanitation sector, a more sector approach will be used where the
44.
IFC and IBRD will work together to bring new ideas for enhancing sector efficiencies.
45.
Along these lines, both groups are currently exploring the identification o f
municipalities where the Subnational Development Support Facility could be deployed to
support infrastructure development without sovereign guarantees.
There are legal
limitations, however, to direct lending.
46.
Local Partnerships. During the execution o f mandates for infrastructure projects,
project and sector knowledge i s developed, in order to assure that this knowledge will be also
for the benefit o f Mexico, a partnership strategy i s currently under development, A coadvisory collaboration between I F C and NAFIN will bring to Mexico all the benefits o f the
IFC-IBRD collaboration and the transaction process expertise to be absorbed by a Mexican
institution. Under this approach there i s an opportunity for co-advising the State o f Yucatan
for a health project.

47.
Business Enabling Environment. The IBRD and IFC will explore possibilities for
collaboration in advisory work to improve the business environment, in particular at the state
and local level. These efforts go hand-in-hand with efforts to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness o f public sector institutions at the state and local level. In addition, the multisector capacity o f the IBRD can be leveraged with business process simplification expertise
in the IFC to offer state and local governments a rather complete package o f advisory
services. See Appendix 1 for more details on how to expand this work, building upon
ongoing initiatives.
48.
Innovative Approaches to Climate Change Mitigation. A Conference will be
organized between the I F C and IBRD to present and discuss international innovative
experiences in the field of mitigation o f Climate Change. The Conference would focus on
policies and programs undertaken by the public sector as well as projects developed by the
private sector. As a result o f the event, we expect to identify specific pilot projects that could
be scaled up in the fbture expanding the activities o f the Group in the area o f climate change.

Annex C: CPS Completion Report

FINAL DRAFT
February 22,2008

MEXICO: CPS Completion Report
Date o f CPS: March 18,2004 Report No. 28141-ME
Date o f CPS Progress Report: January 8,2007 Report No. 37934-MX
Period covered by the CPS Completion Report: FY05-FY08
Summary
T h i s document evaluates the achievement of CPS objectives in Mexico together with the respective
contributions o f the Government and the Bank.

The 2004 CPS was prepared within the framework o f the Bank’s still-evolving agenda for Middle Income
Countries. It clearly acknowledged that the Bank provides only a small part of the overall financial
requirements of Mexico. Hence, the Bank contribution was not to be assessed in terms of resource transfer
but rather in terms o f the international expertise that the Bank could mobilize within the context of projects
and programmatic analytic work. In that context, the Bank has been a facilitator o f communicationthat can
effectively foster the transfer of knowledge and experience.
T h e 2004 Country Partnership Strategy for Mexico was the first document o f that title to be presentedto the
Board of the Bank. It was the product of outreach and consultation with the Government and other diverse
stakeholders including civil society and it was predicated upon a need for the Bank to be flexible and quick
in responding to changing country requirements. Consistent with that approach, CPS outcomes in terms of
lending and AAA differed significantly from the specific tasks identified in the CPS document because the
Bank adapted to changing country circumstances. The principal strategic objectives of the CPS were
successfully achieved.

The CPS was driven by the government’s program and, during the CPS period, the government was
broadly successful in implementing its National Development Plan. Contributing to that outcome, the Bank
delivered a substantial program of knowledge and advisory services drawing upon its world-wide
experience and access to international expertise. T h e success of that program i s evidenced by the quality,
relevance and sustainability of the AAA delivered as judged by the client and other stakeholders. The Bank
also contributed successfully to country outcomes with a diverse lending portfolio that was progressively
adapted to the changing situation in Mexico and that performedwell in terms o f project outcomes.
In terms of lending volumes, the delivery of the program was uneven. Lending in the first two years of the
program (FY05-06) was broadly consistent with the recent past. In September 2006, however, the
government prepaid a large part o f its outstanding IBRD loan portfolio and that was followed by an abrupt
drop in new lending with only one single project approved in FY07.

The prepayment of Bank loans and the drop in lending do not imply a rupture in the Bank’s relationship
with Mexico but rather a change in the dynamic of that relationship. There i s s t i l l an active portfolio of
Bank-supported projects being implemented as well as an active program of AAA all of which generate a
broad range of Bank-client relationships at both the operational and policy levels. There is, therefore,
fertile ground for restoring a strong program o f Bank support consistent with country requirements.
T h e Bank and Mexico are now well placed to move forward with a broad policy dialogue backed by
selective lending operations strategically targeted at areas where the Bank can contribute most effectively.
A more flexible approach to the next CPS i s warranted recognizing the need to respond to evolving client
demands.

MEXICO
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FYO5-OS
COMPLETION REPORT

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
The FYOS-OS Country Partnership Strategy for Mexico was designed within
the still-evolving policy framework of the Bank Group vis-&vis Middle Income
Countries. I t was the first paper o f that title to be presented to the Board o f the Bank for
discussion. In presenting a “Country Partnership Strategy”, rather than the customary
“Country Assistance Strategy”, the Region was clearly signaling a shift o f emphasis and
focus which subsequently received a more general endorsement in a paper prepared for
the Development Committee”. The Bank management and Board have not made a
formal differentiation between a Country Assistance Strategy and a Country Partnership
Strategy, but a distinction i s emerging with continued usage in middle income countries
(MIC). As a partnership strategy, the CPS i s the product o f outreach and consultation
with the Government and other diverse stakeholders including civil society. The
principles o f Bank engagement with Mexico’s development program were based upon
flexibility and an agile response to the changing needs o f the country as i t moved forward
with program implementation. In keeping with a greater emphasis on flexibility
consistent with the Bank’s M I C agenda, other recent CPSs, such at that for Chile, have
l e f t undefined the specific lending operations and AAA to be undertaken during the
program period except for those already agreed with the client for the first year or so.’’
The 2004 CPS for Mexico did not go that far. I t followed the more traditional practice o f
specifying a complete program o f lending and AAA for the entire FY05-08 period. As a
result, there was a significant discrepancy between the detailed program specified in the
CPS and actual outcomes as the Bank strove to accommodate the changing needs o f the
client in the course o f program implementation.
This completion report does not fault the Bank for the discrepancy between the
2.
detailed CPS program and actual outcomes. Rather, i t assesses the CPS within the
framework o f the Bank’s s t i l l evolving M I C agenda. In that context, the CPS i s
evaluated against three criteria. Since the CPS was driven by the Government’s program,
the first criterion i s based on how effectively the Government has achieved i t s
development vision as determined by a select set o f country development goals. Second,
the knowledge and advisory services o f the Bank - a key element o f the CPS - are judged
with respect to their quality, relevance and sustainability in contributing to the policy
process rather than by linking them to specific country outcomes per se. Third, since the
lending operations o f the Bank Group are very small in relation to Mexico’s overall
capital requirements, their effectiveness i s not to be judged in terms o f resource transfer
but rather in terms o f their success in meeting specific project indicators and by overall
portfolio performance. By those three criteria, implementation o f the 2004 Mexico CPS
was satisfactory.

3.
Nevertheless, implementation o f the lending program proceeded in an
unanticipated step-wise fashion. In the first two years, FY05-06, the volume o f lending
was broadly consistent with the recent past and with the CPS. In September 2006,
however, the government made use o f buoyant foreign exchange reserves to prepay a
large part o f i t s outstanding IBRD loan portfolio. The prepayment coincided with an
abrupt fall in new lending. In FY07, only one loan was approved in an amount o f US$29
million.
4.
The reasons behind the prepayment and the step-down in lending are examined in
Section N below. They do not imply a rupture or diminution in the Bank’s relationship
with Mexico but rather a change in the dynamic o f that relationship. The ongoing
portfolio o f projects under execution and a major program o f AAA provide a propitious
context for continuing with a strong program o f Bank support in the future.

11. MEXICO’S NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND CPS
OBJECTIVES
5.
The Federal Government laid out its development strategy in the National
Development Plan (NDP) for 2001-2006. The Plan was produced at a time o f political
change in Mexico and it focused prominently on issues o f democracy and governance.
The Plan defined three broad strategic goals: social and human development, quality
I t affirmed the hndamental
economic growth, and order and security (see Annex I).
importance o f poverty reduction as a primary goal o f economic development and
emphasized the importance o f increasing competitiveness and strengthening institutions.
These underlying goals were supported by the CPS.

6.
The monitoring matrix of the CPS was aligned with country development
objectives taken from the NDP. The CPS gave emphasis to environmental concerns.
However, since the CPS was not results-based, the matrix did not differentiate between
CPS outcomes and country-wide outcomes.

111. CPS OUTCOMES

The Macroeconomic Context
7.
Mexico continued on a path o f steady economic growth averaging 3.5 percent a
year throughout the CPS period and growth has been accompanied by a significant
decline in poverty. Exports have continued to grow in volume terms and even more so in
value terms, buoyed by the rising price o f petroleum. Macroeconomic management has
been good with inflation, as measured by the annual rise in consumer prices, holding
steady at 3-4 percent in recent years. Unemployment in the formal sector o f the economy
has likewise remained at a l o w 3-4 percent. An overall favorable economic performance
has prompted international credit agencies to upgrade their credit ratings for Mexico.
Standard & Poor’s was the latest to do so in October 2007 when it raised Mexico’s longterm foreign debt rating by one notch to BBB+ and increased the local currency rating
from A to A+. However, sustained long-term growth will require a continuation o f
structural and policy reforms, ranging from fiscal and social reforms to competitiveness
reforms.

The CPS Vision
8.
The CPS was designed to: (a) focus on issues where the Bank could bring
technical expertise from a world-wide perspective in the context o f a relatively small
number o f lending operations; (b) use programmatic analytical work in areas where the
Bank could provide high value-added expertise; and (c) retain flexibility to respond to
new opportunities that may arise during implementation o f the CPS. The partnership
strategy recognized that “Bank lending provides a very small share o f public revenues
and the government has ready access to alternative private financing”. In addition, there
were country-specific institutional constraints because line ministries are subject to an
overall budget constraint so that Bank loans are not additional. As a result, the Bank has
concentrated on learning and knowledge sharing activities that contribute to the debate on
key policy reforms. This strategy aligned World Bank and I F C support for the
Government’s priorities within the context o f four pillars: (i)
reducing poverty and
inequality; (ii)increasing Mexico’s competitiveness; (iii)strengthening the country’s
institutions; and (iv) promoting environmental sustainability. Lending scenarios in the
range o f US$0.8 to US$1.7 billion per year were proposed, with US$1.2 billion a year
being identified as the most likely base case outcome.
9.
The CPS predated the Bank’s results framework and did not identify core
outcomes. Instead, i t provided medium-term indicative country targets as benchmarks. I t
i s difficult to separate out clearly the contribution o f the Bank to overall country
outcomes because the Bank program is only a small part o f the development effort.
Indicators that attribute results to the Bank program are difficult to design and monitor. In
middle income countries such as Mexico, it must be acknowledged that CPS outcomes
primarily reflect the efforts o f the Government and the country. A successful Bank
program o f lending and AAA i s supportive o f development outcomes to the extent that it
effectively contributes to the policy agenda debate. A principal objective o f the CPS was
to enhance the value-added o f the Bank through targeted analytical work with a view to
assisting project and policy design. As a result, i t proposed a bundling o f analytical
instruments in key areas o f opportunity supported by selected loan operations.
10.
This section examines the outcomes for each CPS pillar. The medium-term
indicative country targets established as benchmarks to monitor the Bank’s performance

46

are projected for end-FY08. In addition to the country targets, the Bank aligned, where
applicable, the medium-term country targets to the long-term Millennium Development

Goals (MDGs) for 2015.

Pillar I: Reduce Poverty and Inequality

Overview
11.
Mexico made steady progress in reducing poverty and income inequality
during the CPS period. Considerable gains were made in reducing the number o f
people below the official Mexican food-based poverty line. By that measure the number
o f poor fell from 24.1 percent in 2000 to 13.8 percent in 2006. Urban populations are
generally better off, with urban poverty falling from 11 percent in 2000 to 7.5 percent in
2006. Rural poverty i s considerably more prevalent and i s apt to fluctuate widely from
year to year in line with agricultural output. In recent years, however, rural poverty has
fallen markedly from 42.4 percent in 2000 to 24.5 percent in 2006.
12.
As a result, Mexico remains on track for achieving the MDG goal to halve
the number of people in extreme poverty by 2015. Poor households in rural areas have
benefited from a stable macroeconomic environment, income diversification into nonagricultural activities, and increased spending in social programs including conditional
cash transfer programs such as Oportunidades and Procampo. The introduction o f the
Ley de Desarollo Social (Law o f Social Development) and the National Evaluation
Council’s social development strategy provide additional support for such programs.
Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, f e l l between 2000 and 2002
although has risen slightly since then.12
Table 2. Performance Indicators for Pillar I

l2According to INEGI, the Gini coefficient was 0.528 in 2000 and fell to 0.501 in 2002 before rising to
0.502 in 2004 and 0.508 in 2005.

Bank Support for Poverty Reduction through Programmatic AAA
13.
At the Government’s request, the Bank supported the underlying policy base
for poverty reduction and assisted with the design, monitoring and evaluation of
social protection and poverty-relatedprograms. The core instrument for Bank support
has been the Poverty Programmatic AAA, which was developed in collaboration with the
Social Cabinet, The work was organized in three phases: (i)an overall poverty analysis
(FY04); (ii)
studies on urban and rural poverty and social protection systems (FY05); and
(iii)analysis o f decentralized hnding and the delivery o f social services (FY06). In
addition, the Bank approved an IDF grant to assist the Secretariat o f Social Development
(SEDESOL) develop an integrated system o f monitoring and evaluation for social
programs. A proposed CONTIGO SAL (US$300 million) in support o f the Federal
Government’s social policies was dropped, because the Government felt that the complex
task o f coordinating implementation across ministries would present too high a risk.
Subsequently, a loan in support o f continuing the Bank’s programmatic analytic work
and implementation o f its recommendations within SEDESOL was not made because
authorities did not believe that external financing was needed. When a new government
took office, Policy Notes were employed to convey the findings o f the work done to the
incoming administration.
14.
Three reports were produced: Poverty in Mexico: An Assessment of
Conditions, Trends and Government Strategy ( N 0 4 ) , Income Generation and Social
Protection for the Poor (FYOS) and Decentralized Delivery for the Poor ( N 0 6 ) . The
first report was discussed at the highest levels o f government, culminating in a
presentation to the President o f Mexico and members o f the Cabinet in June 2004. The
success o f the first phase established the Bank as an authoritative reference on poverty in
Mexico. The Government approved the publication and dissemination o f the study, an
unprecedented step in Mexico for such a high-profile issue. The report generated nationwide media coverage. A QAG assessment rated the first phase as highly satisfactory.
President Fox referred to the recommendations o f the second poverty report in his 2006
budget submission. The reports have also contributed to the design and reform o f key
social protection programs and to the debate on public pension reform.
15.
The Bank was also able to draw upon programmatic poverty work in
respondingpromptly to other government requests. Analytic notes and a presentation
were prepared for the Presidency with a comprehensive review o f the social protection
system, drawing upon ongoing work and the Bank’s broader international experience. A
policy dialogue on these issues i s continuing with the Calder6n administration. In
addition, the Bank approved an IDF grant to assist the Secretariat o f Social Development
(SEDESOL) in developing an integrated system o f monitoring and evaluation for social
programs.

16.
Complementary to Bank efforts, IFC expanded i t s support to help increase credit
to micro- and small-enterprises through financial intermediaries. A US$15 million partial
credit guarantee was made in support o f Mexico’s first-ever bond issued by a
microfinance institution. The bond issue provided a total o f $43.0 million to three
financial institutions in support o f their micro-credit operations. In addition, I F C invested
US$45 million in a regional bank that focuses o n SMEs and agribusiness. These

48

investments are aimed at generating jobs and thereby raising the income o f the
underprivileged population to help alleviate poverty and inequality.
17.
Poverty reduction would have been more rapid were it not for lagging real
wages over the last decade. Creating well paying jobs has been a key government
priority. With this in mind, the Bank initiated in FY07 a study entitled An Agenda for
Growth and Employment which sought to identify the relationship between economic
growth in Mexico, j o b creation and wage growth in order to develop policy options for
the future. The study draws o n international experience and on Mexico’s o w n experience
by region and sector.

Basic Education
18.
There was steady progress towards country targets in terms of education and
well being. The net primary enrollment o f children in rural areas increased from 91
percent in 2002 to 95.8 percent in 2005, suggesting that the 96 percent target may be
surpassed by the end o f the CPS period. On the other hand, preliminary estimates show
that less progress i s being achieved in secondary education. Secondary terminal
efficiency stood at 78.8 percent in 2004-05, making it unlikely that the target o f 88
percent will be met unless there i s a concerted effort.
19.
The key element of Bank support for education under the CPS was the
programmatic AAA, including policy notes, seminars, and conferences.
Programmatic AAA on education focused on the quality of educational outcomes.
The objectives were to: (i)
help build a consensus o n ways to improve the quality o f
education in Mexico; (ii)
help to identify programs that were to be scaled-up; and (iii)
help build a consensus for the public dissemination o f information o n such issues as
education outcomes, the benefits o f school autonomy, and strategies for empowering
parents. T o that end, discussions were held with a high-level government team.
A first phase report, Determinants of Learning Policy Note, was published in
20.
FY05. I t analyzed the determinants o f learning in Mexico using data from the OECD’s
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and complemented the analysis
with national assessments, as well as new work o n the returns to quality and bilingual
education. The Bank’s focus on quality o f education brought to the fore the issue o f
testing and, in 2006, the government began an annual national assessment (Prueba
ENLACE) o f students. T o increase accountability, the results o f testing have been posted
online. The annual national assessment i s an important achievement, marking the first
time that the quality o f education in Mexico is being assessed in a comprehensive
manner.

21.
The Government i s now putting quality at the top of the agenda, with the
creation of an independent evaluation institute and by measuring educational
attainment through national and international assessments. Bank analytical work has
also focused on the quality o f education for disfavored groups, and in particular
indigenous groups and they are n o w monitored separately by the government. A
mechanism has been put in place for continued dialogue on education issues through a
steering committee and meetings at the state level.

49

22.
A second phase o f the education AAA led to a report, Mexico: Improving the
Effectiveness of Education through Compensating for disadvantages, School-Based
Management and Enhanced Accountability (FY06). An evaluation o f key education
programs included: (i)bilingual education programs in indigenous schools; (ii)
compensatory education and i t s interface with the conditional cash transfer program
Oportunidades; and (iii)
the school-based management program, PEC. In collaboration
with other institutions, the Bank organized a conference on mobilizing public-private
partnerships in education, drawing upon the experience o f both developing and developed
countries. The Bank was also actively involved in meetings with government and the
private sector, and made a presentation at a forum on accountability in education
organized by the Instituto de Foment0 e Investigacibn Educativa , a private business
group. The Bank continues to be actively engaged in the sector and additional AAA on
Secondary Education is planned for FY08.
23.
Analytic findings formed the basis o f Bank assistance for hard-to-reach
populations through an APL in Basic Education, which now covers 25 percent o f schools,
targeting those in poor rural areas. The work was also used as an input to prepare and
appraise a School-Based Management APL (FY06) that supports Mexico’s Quality
Schools Program (PEC). The project supports Mexico’s Quality in Schools Program
which now reaches 10 percent o f schools and which seeks to improve quality by
enhancing school autonomy, accountability and assessment. Support for access in higher
education includes Bank assistance for a scholarship program for poor students and
specific initiatives to encourage indigenous students at secondary and higher levels to
stay in school. The Tertiary Education Student Assistance loan (FY06) supports the
sustainable and equitable expansion o f tertiary education through student loan and grant
programs, compensatory incentives for disadvantaged students, and the development o f a
national tertiary education policy. Progress under this operation has been slower than
expected due to complex institutional and administration arrangements for the use o f loan
proceeds.
24.
A strategic focus o f the IFC has been to support investment in human capital. To
that end, IFC committed a total o f US$45.9 million equivalent in two education sector
projects, including (i)
US$30.4 million for an affordable technical university that targets
lower and middle income students and (ii)
US$15.5 million, including US$0.9 million in
equity, for a specialized non-bank financial institution that focuses o n financing the
higher education sector. The latter investment supports the development and expansion
o f the private sector student loan market, thereby enabling less wealthy students to
finance their post-secondary education with long-term loans.

Health Care
25.
Steady progress has been made towards health sector targets including HIV
among the young and malaria-related morbidity. The under-five mortality rate
decreased from 20.5 per 1,000 births in 2003 to 15.7 per 1,000 births in 2007, close to the
target o f 15 per 1,000 births. The maternal mortality rate decreased only slightly to 60
per 100,000 births in 2006, from 63.9 per 100,000 in 2002 and remains well short o f the
target o f 45 per 100,000 births by 2008. In that respect, however, Mexico i s no different
from other MICs, all o f which have found i t difficult
to make progress with this indicator.

50

26.
Bank assistance in the health sector focused on providing continuing support
for the 2003 reforms of the National Health Law which established a universal
health insurance program, the Sistema de Proteccibn Social en Salud (SPSS). The
Bank has supported increased access to healthcare by the poor through a three-phased
APL. The Basic Health Care Project 111(PROCEDES), approved in June 2001, supports
implementation o f the SPSS, specifically with respect to: (i)improving access o f the
poor to the subsidized regime o f the Seguro Popular; (ii)
restructuring and developing the
State Health System; and (iii)
strengthening the Secretariat o f Health as steward o f the
SPSS, Early implementation problems resulted from unanticipated changes in the
National Health Law which necessitated amendments to the loan agreement. During
FY07, however, the project regained i t s footing and appears on track for successful
implementation. Another health sector loan planned in the CPS, the Health System
SWAP, has been postponed to FY10.
27.

On the part o f IFC, investments for a total amount o f US$19.5 million were made
in two hospitals that complement the public sector healthcare. One o f the investments
supported a hospital that focused especially on lower income patients while the other
facilitated the opening o f an advanced medical facility.
28.
There was progress in efforts to provide broader access for low-income
households to housing and land ownership. At the start o f the Fox administration, the
Government undertook to double the production o f formal-sector housing to 750,000
housing units a year by 2006; a goal that was achieved by 2004. A major success story
has been the role o f Sofoles, specialized non-deposit taking financial institutions,
supported by the Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal (SHF), which was chartered in 2001 as a
federal development bank. These specialized financial institutions have made over
850,000 mortgage loans over the last ten years.
29.
The Bank i s supporting broader access to low-income housing and land
ownership with a three phase Housing and Urban Programmatic DPL as well as
TAL operations. The first US$lOO million loan, which closed in December 2004,
supported: (i)the design and implementation o f a new national housing policy and
accompanying institutional arrangements; (ii)
the establishment o f home loans for low
and moderate-income groups; and (iii)
initial steps to harmonize housing subsidies and
modernize urban property registration systems. In parallel, a coordinated national urban
development policy was developed and implemented at the federal and local levels, with
a focus on strengthening institutions and developing land for low-income housing.
According to an IEG evaluation o f the first phase, the project was moderately satisfactory
and i t s objectives were partially achieved. The second housing loan, which closed in
June 2006, consolidated and deepened reforms made under the first loan. A TAL was
approved in November 2004. I t i s proceeding well and there has been good progress in
the sector. The percentage o f housing destined for lower income groups (households
earning less than five times the minimum wage) increased from 49 percent in 2005 to 53
percent in 2006. A third phase o f the D P L program was presented to the Board in the
first half o f FY08. I t focused on housing subsidy refom, the mainstreaming o f housing
micro-finance, and the further modernization o f property registration.
30.

Working in parallel to the Bank, IFC has helped increase access to lower income
housing by providing finance for a total o f US$380.4 million to leading mortgage
51

lenders, as well as offering technical and advisory assistance o n the institutional and
policy framework for housing finance. IFC investments were leveraged to reach a greater
number o f households.

International competitiveness rankings improved over the CPS period.
Mexico climbed significantly in the Bank's Doing Business index and, in 2008, was
ranked 44'h out o f 178 countries. Mexico was ranked as the third top reformer in the
world in 2006 and the top reformer in the Latin America region. Reforms that merit
attention include: (i)
strengthening investor protections with a new Securities Law; (ii)
cutting the time to start a business; and (iii)
reducing corporate income taxes from 33
percent in 2004 to 29 percent in 2006. The Global Competitiveness Index o f the World
Economic Forum, which provides a broad overview o f factors that are critical for driving
productivity and competitiveness, also shows progress. Mexico ranked 4gth out o f 122
countries in 2007/8 as compared with 52nd place in the previous year. The index
registered relatively high scores for health care and primary education, efficient
marketing and some aspects o f technology, but those positive factors were offset by
institutional weaknesses.

Bank Support with Programmatic M A
34.
The Bank's programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had its origins
in an earlier collaboration with the Government on issues o f competitiveness. The
Bank worked with the Office o f the President to assist the Government in defining a
national Competitiveness Agenda 2004-06. The success o f this assistance led to the
elaboration o f the Programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA for FY05-FY08,
which sought to broaden the dialogue on competitiveness to stakeholders beyond the
executive and the private sector.
35.
The four year programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA was initially

implementation o f the Mexican Competitiveness Agenda. The aim was not to produce an
analytical piece on competitiveness, but to fill some key knowledge gaps that were
necessary for the Competitiveness Agenda and to provide non-lending technical
assistance to move the agenda forward. The second phase brings key policy messages
into the public sphere. Policy Notes have also served that objective.
36.
A report was published for both the first and second phases of the
programmatic AAA. The two-volume first phase report, Mexico's Challenge of
Knowledge-based Competitiveness: Challenges and Opportunities, argued that Mexico
had to act now to take advantage o f the opportunities arising from the knowledge
revolution. The second phase report, Mexico 's Competitiveness: Reaching Its Potential,
informed policy makers, the private sector, and the public at large about competitiveness
priorities and shortcomings. The focus was on measures to enhance Mexico's efficiency,
generate jobs, and move the country to a more innovation-driven stage o f development.
an assessment o f the quality o f infrastructure and
Focused analytic pieces included: (i)
key weaknesses o f the Mexican innovation system; (ii)
an assessment o f the draft labor
law reform and i t s likely impact on indicators for Doing Business; (iii)a study o f
logistics costs and bottlenecks and (iv) an analysis o f the impact o f tariff reforms on
trade. The Bank has held discussions and briefings with major policymakers and
stakeholders and has contributed to the competitiveness strategy o f two state
development plans. I t has also made a series o f presentations to the new Senate
Committee on Competitiveness.

53

37.
The programmatic Competitiveness and Trade AAA had a number o f
positive impacts. The collaboration with the Government has been largely successful.
The more focused analytical pieces were well-regarded by public officials, particularly
for bringing an international perspective to the challenges faced by Mexico. More
broadly, an important contribution o f the Bank was perceived to be i t s role in facilitating
a consensus on the need for reforms. The success o f this work led to the approval o f the
first Competitiveness DPL in FY05. That loan supported measures to enhance
transparency and improve the regulatory framework to enhance competitiveness,

The Business Climate
38.
There has been an improvement in business registration. Rapid Business
Opening Systems have facilitated new entry in 74 municipalities, although this has not
yet led to a reduction in the average number o f days to register a business nationwide.
FIAS carried out “Doing Business” analysis in twelve cities in Mexico in 2005, and in 31
cities and states in 2007. IFC has undertaken pilot programs to simplify business
registration and licensing at the municipal level. In addition, the Bank, with the
participation o f IFC, is offering fee-for-service advice in the area o f investment climate
reform for the Federal District. That effort will continue to focus on the procedures for
opening a business. The state o f Guerrero i s currently working with IFC in improving the
investment climate through a partial fee for service. The creation o f the Senate
Competitiveness Committee, to which the Bank made a series o f presentations, has
helped promote reforms to increase Mexico’s competitiveness. Complementing the
regulatory agenda, WBI has fostered a dialogue with over 500 business representatives
through the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Competitiveness Course.

Box 1. Equity and Competition Conference
On November 27-28, 2006, the W o r l d Bank’s Mexico Office and the D a v i d Rockefeller Center for L a t i n
American Studies o f Harvard University organized an international conference to address the relationship
between the unequal structure o f power and influence and the design o f economic institutions and policies
in Mexico. The conference was organized into eight sessions: (i)
overview o f the relationship between
unequal influences and economic growth; (ii)
mechanisms by which concentrated wealth and power in the
business sector and corporatist groups such as unions have distorted policy design and contributed t o
inefficient markets, which in turn has impacted negatively o n economic growth; (iii)
analysis o f unequal
institutional structures o n the o i l sector; (iv) the insufficiency o f financial intermediation in Mexico; (v)
analysis o f institutions and competition, focusing o n the lack o f significant economic, political and social
reforms despite a change in the political regime; (vi) overview o f the social security system and its negative
impact o n labor productivity and growth; (vii) impact o f monopolies and insufficient competition in the
telecommunications sector; and (viii) implications for the future design o f public policies in Mexico.

Policymakers, market participants, politicians, and researchers attended the conference and contributed to a
lively debate. The finance minister, Francisco Diaz Gil, gave a keynote speech. The proceedings were
widely discussed in the local media which emphasized the critical link between equity and competitiveness,
and suggested policy reforms needed to remove impediments to higher economic growth. A publication
based o n the proceedings o f the conference i s currently under preparation with the support o f the D a v i d
Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. Although t h i s activity was not originally planned in the
CPS, it provides a good illustration o f the way in which the Bank used the opportunity o f the political
transition t o bring to the public arena a subject o f vital importance.

Education for Greater Innovation
39.
The Government has made progress in innovation and education to make the
workforce more competitive. Building on the 2002 legal framework, Mexico has
established 25 science and technology councils at the state level. The number of
researchers in the national research system (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, SNZ) has
grown at an average rate o f 10 percent, increasing from 7,466 in 2000 to 12,096 in 2005.
Public funding to SNI increased by 13.5 percent in 2005, representing a quarter of
CONACYT‘s budget. The Bank has been supporting these efforts through the Innovation
for Competitiveness APL I (FY06) which aims to consolidate ongoing sector reforms in
science and technology by strengthening programs for business innovation and human
capital development. That includes: (i)promoting business innovation; (ii)financing
scholarships; and (iii)supporting policies to strengthen the framework for science,
technology and innovation and foster international linkages. In addition, Bank education
loans will boost long-run competitiveness by training a more skilled workforce.

Infrastructure
40.
Significant advances have been made in the provision of roads, electricity,
and water, though gaps persist in poor, rural and indigenous communities. The
Bank has been supporting efforts to expand the coverage and quality o f roads through the
Decentralized Infrastructure Development Loan (FY04, US$108 million), a state level
loan which provides financing to the State o f Guanajuato to strengthen i t s infrastructure
strategy and planning. Progress has been satisfactory. The Bank also furnished technical
assistance related to highway finance reform and i s providing advice on a fee-for-service
basis for the institutional reform o f toll roads. Additional support to the infrastructure
sector was provided through the Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review (FY05), which
analyzed the effectiveness and efficiency o f public infrastructure spending in water
supply and sanitation, transport and electricity.
41.
During the CPS period, IFC supported Government efforts to encourage
investments in infrastructure with the participation o f the private sector. I F C provided
financing US$126.6 million (including US$50 million in equity and US$11 million for
syndications) for innovative infrastructure projects. Support was furnished to one o f the
first PPP road projects in Mexico and to a company interested in investing in future PPP
projects, to a newly established affordable airline carrier, and to a recycling company.

IFC support for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)

In 2002 IFC funded and assisted “Partnerships”, the UK technical assistance initiative t o the Mexican
authorities for the development o f a Public-Private Partnershipprogram. The PPP program benefits f r o m
both public and private sector expertise and i s critical for the public services needs o f Mexico, such as
infrastructure, healthcare and education. IFC has provided advisory and technical assistance to the
government in coordination with IBRD while, o n the other hand, engaging with private sector companies
interested in a PPP contract for specific projects. In FY07, IFC M s h e d a US$12 m i l l i o n equivalent
partial guarantee in support o f the f i r s t project concessioned t o the private sector under the program. That
project consisted o f the expansion, upgrading, operation and maintenance o f a 74.3 km road between the
cities o f Irapuato and La Piedad de Cabadas in the State o f Guanajuato. The participation o f IFC helped to
allay risks in project implementation and reassured the market that the project was bankable. The project i s
likely to have a demonstration effect for h t u r e concession contracts.

Financial Intermediation
42.
Mexico has made great strides towards consolidating the financial sector and
has introduced reforms to increase competition. Since the first debt crisis o f 1982 and
the effects o f the financial crisis o f 1994-95, Mexico has gone through a long process o f
financial sector restructuring and consolidation. Growth o f the financial sector i s
accelerating with increased competition. In the banking sector, there i s s t i l l a need for
changes to the Credit Institutions Law. In the non-banking sector there i s a need to
deregulate Sofoles and adjust the laws relating to trust, insurance and pension funds. In
the bond market, new debt instruments are making it easier to obtain financing by issuing
domestic debt, while the Securities Law passed in December 2006 is expected to improve
the functioning o f the stock market. The main Bank instrument for support to the
financial sector was the Finance and Growth DPL (FY06). That operation supported a
series o f financial sector reforms, including the Securities Law and strengthened
oversight by corporate boards. This D P L replaced the Access to Financial Services
project originally planned for FY07 in the CPS. The 2006 update to the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) provided analytical support to other reforms, including the
Banking Resolution Law. In FY08, the SHCP has asked the Bank to undertake a study o f
competition in the banking sector. The principal findings o f the study, which covered
such topics as the performance o f development banks, access to finance by SMEs, and
micro-insurance, were presented to the Government in December 2007 and January 2008.
43.
The Bank Group has also supported access to financial services by sectors
underserved by commercial banks. The US$505.1 million Rural Finance SAL (FY03)
supported the liquidation o f Banrural and the creation o f Financiera Rural, a
decentralized financial institution in charge o f promoting the development o f rural
financial markets and lending to small and medium rural producers. The' project also
supported the Government's broader goal o f reducing the fiscal drain o f loss-making
banks, while enhancing access to financial services for sectors not served by commercial
banks. According to an IEG evaluation, as a result o f the project, the Government has
made major inroads in reforming the rural finance market and in restructuring the
financial sector. IEG rated the project highly satisfactory. The second phase o f the
Savings and Rural Finance Project (BANSEFI) has helped the Government strengthen
more than 400 local savings and credit institutions and place them on a sound financial
footing, thereby affording many low-income families with access to financial services
that they would otherwise not enjoy.
44.
IFC has complemented Bank assistance in the financial sector with support in a
total amount o f US$578.8 million over the period FY05-08 for mortgages (including
securitization), microfinance, banks, trade, and private equity funds. Making use o f
advisory services when appropriate, IFC focused on promoting access to financial
services for underserved retail entities while, in the case o f the corporate sector, helping
increase the access o f MSMEs to debt and equity finance. In addition, IFC helped
develop the market for education finance by investing in a mortgage institution (Sofol)
that specializes in the education sector.
45.
The housing finance market has expanded rapidly in recent years. The
Federal Mortgage Agency, SHF, has fostered the development o f Sofoles, special
purpose, non-deposit private credit institutions, and has established the legal and
56

regulatory framework for a flourishing secondary mortgage market. The Bank supported
the strengthening and expansion o f the private mortgage market through the FOVI
Restructuring project (US$505.1 million, approved FY99), which extended support to the
Banking Finance Fund for Housing (FOVr) and to its successor institution the SHF. The
I C R for this operation listed many accomplishments including assisting a program o f
mortgage lending from 2000 to 2005 that financed some 290,000 mortgages for a total
value o f US$7 billion equivalent. Since 2004, the SHF has supported asset-backed
securities with guarantees for timely payment.
46.
I F C has provided fhding and technical assistance to housing sector Sofoles and
other mortgage providers, and it has continued to facilitate the development o f a
secondary mortgage market development. I F C support has included remittance-backed
mortgages, warehousing lines, partial credit guarantees and technical and advisory
assistance. Since the SHF i s scheduled to stop direct funding for Sofoles in the coming
years, IFC's efforts have been geared towards enabling Sofoles to seek fhding from the
market on their own account and continue providing affordable mortgages to Mexican
homeowners.

Pillar 111 Strengthening Institutions

Overview
47.
During the CPS period there was a further development and consolidation o f
democratic institutions. The presidential elections o f 2006 resulted in a very narrow
electoral victory that initially provoked strong protest and resistance from the defeated
candidate. The strengthening o f democratic institutions i s a declared objective o f
President Calderon. Specific measures to strengthen the democratic framework have
followed. In June 2007, for example, Congress approved a constitutional amendment
making access to information a constitutionally protected civil right.
48.
The strengthening o f democratic institutions did not immediately lead to a
corresponding improvement in governance indicators. Mexico's ranking on the WBI
Governance Indicators-Voice and Accountability, Government Effectiveness, Control
o f Corruption-have not changed in statistically significant terms. Mexico's ranking in
the Voice and Accountability indicator decreased to the 52"d percentile in 2006, from the
55th percentile in 2002, making it unlikely that it will attain the CPS 70th percentile target
by 2008. The same applies to other governance indicators for which benchmarks were
specified in the CPS. In retrospect i t would appear that the percentile ranking within the
framework o f WBI indicators does not constitute an appropriate target for individual
countries because the outcome also depends upon the performance o f all other countries
across the board.

Public Finance Management
49.
Strong institutions must be based on the sound management of public
finances and the Bank has assisted in that endeavor with programmatic AAA,
structured in three phases. The Bank assisted the Secretariat o f Finance and Public
Credit (SHCP) through fee-based analytical services aimed at the modernization and
reform o f public finances. The Bank also supported the federal public finances reform
agenda through the Convencidn Nacional Hacendaria (CNH) and the Review of Federal
Government Procurement, Financial Management and Disbursement Systems (FY06).
This report evaluated the feasibility o f using country systems within World Bank
financed operations. Progress on the recommendations o f the report has been mixed to
date. However, there has been progress in Bank-IDB collaboration, especially with
regard to project procurement and financial management.

50.
States now have an enhanced role within Mexico’s decentralized fiscal
framework, they were the focus of important programmatic AAA. In FY05, the
Bank completed the State-Level Technical Assistance to Establish Performance
Indicators for Procurement, Public Expenditure and Financial Management report. This
assessed the performance o f sub-national fiduciary systems, with the aim o f providing
state governments with a tool for assessing their performance. In FY06 the Bank
produced another report, Improving Fiscal Transparency and Administrative
Performance at the State Level, which was designed as a policy note for the new federal
administration. Although the recommended state indicators have yet to be systematically
adopted, the work done by the Bank has given an impulse to reexamine state-level
accounting and to harmonize reporting. In 2006, the Institute for the Technical
development o f Public Finances (INDETEC), a public entity o f the National System o f
Fiscal Coordination, published a report on general criteria for the harmonization o f
budget and accounting, which drew upon the Bank’s analytical work. One o f the
outcomes o f this work has been an IDF grant to the State o f Aguascalientes,
Strengthening Fiscal Transparency through Harmonized Accounting Systems (FY07),
which aims to build capacity for harmonized accounting systems. I t is also supportive o f
federal-state partnerships.

58

51.
An Institutional Governance Review (IGR) was completed in FY07. The IGR
responded to a perception that the pace o f economic reforms has slowed in recent years
and i t considers how Mexico’s democratic governance may be strengthened over time. I t
was also designed to facilitate the country dialogue during the political transition and to
contribute to the ongoing debate on political governance. The report has only recently
been published and i t i s too early to assess i t s impact. A Public Expenditure Review PER
(FY05) concentrated on overall fiscal sustainability, rigidities in expenditure, the
distribution o f benefits o f public spending between households by income level, the
regional distribution o f spending, and the institutions for budgeting and expenditure
State Pension Suwey; (ii)
Country Financial
management. Other outputs include: (i)
Accountability Assessment (CFAA); and (iii)Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR). The State Pension Suwey examined the sustainability o f state-level sponsored
civil-service pension schemes, as these schemes are becoming a major fiscal burden on
state public finances. A CPAR update was carried out during FY07 and was delivered in
FY08. At the request o f the new government, i t focuses on issues o f procurement. C F A A
resources were re-allocated to the Accounting and Budgetary Harmonization Study
(FY08-09), given the prominence o f this issue within Mexico’s public finances.
The Bank actively supported the Convencidn Nacional Hacendaria (CNH), a
52.
six-month symposium which aimed to bring about a national consensus on reforms
to the fiscal system at all three levels of government. In August 2004 a final meeting
o f the Convention endorsed a number o f reform proposals, which included the devolution
o f sales tax to states and municipalities, reform o f the tax regime o f the national o i l
company, PEMEX, and the reform o f the public pension system. The Bank was invited
to provide policy papers and strategy notes for the CNH and Bank staff commented on
the emerging agenda, focusing on key issues o f transfer design, tax assignment and
transparency in reporting. The Bank also helped organize a seminar o f federalism experts
which was broadcast live to Congress and to 30 campuses o f Monterrey Technical
University and, together with USAID, reviewed proposals that were made during the
CNH. After the closure o f the CNH, the Bank provided follow-up support, including
non-lending technical assistance concerning the design o f indicators for state-level
financial management and procurement. During FY08-09 the Bank plans to provide
additional support for the harmonization accounting and budgeting at the federal, state
and municipal levels, a goal that was embraced both by the CNH and in the 2007-12
National Development Plan o f the Calder6n administration.

The WBI has also made an active contribution to Bank Group support for
strengthening institutions. Key capacity-building objectives pursued by WBI include
strengthening the institutional capacity o f sub-national governments; improving
53.

transparency, voice and accountability; and fostering greater public-private cooperation
in meeting development objectives. The WBI program has enjoyed a broad level o f
outreach, to a large extent reflecting the strong partnership that has been established with
the Monterrey Institute o f Technology (ITESM) and its Virtual University.

59

I

Box 3. Reform of the Federal Civil Service Pension System
On M a r c h 28 2007, the Senate enacted legislation to reform the federal c i v i l service pension system. The
l a w provides for a 10-year lengthening o f the minimum retirement age, higher worker contributions and
individual retirement accounts. As a result, the cost o f pensions to the federal pension agency (Znstituto de
Seguridud y Sewicios Sociules, ZSSSTE) will be reduced over the medium-term. The reform will lead to a
rationalization o f benefits by merging 2 1 different types o f benefit into four: old-age; disability; work risks;
and healthcare. Those four categories o f benefit are similar t o those that apply in the private-sector system
(ZMSS). The l a w also allows for portability o f pensions so that workers who change employment between
the private and public sector remaining covered. There is t o be a transition period in which older workers
will remain under the currently defined benefit system, new employees will enter into the new defined
contribution system and those currently o n the payroll will be able to choose to remain in the current
system o f defined benefits or migrate t o the new system. The new pension finds will be administered by a
public institution called Pensionisste for a minimum o f three years, after which employees will be able t o
switch t o a private fund.

The 2002 CAS envisaged an ZSSSTE programmatic structural adjustment loan, as w e l l as technical
assistance for the ZSSSTE. Although neither o f those loans was finalized, the preparatory technical work o n
pensions was later used by the Government. The contribution o f the Bank was to underscore the need for
pension reform, and to undertake needed technical work.

54.
The Bank has also made loans in support of the government’s efforts to
enhance fiscal management. The CPS envisaged a SAL in support o f Strengthening
Public Finances but this was dropped when the government prepaid a number o f Bank
loans and reduced i t s estimated need for additional quick-disbursing Bank finance.
Instead, a loan i s envisaged for FY09 in support o f improved tax administration that
would follow up on the ongoing Tax Administration Institutional Development project
that was approved in FY02. Implementation o f that project i s proceeding well. By mid2007, the taxpayer base had been increased from 7.5 million to almost 9 million and the
cost o f tax collection had been reduced from 1.43 cents per peso collected to 1.17 cents.
55.
The Bank has also supported efforts to strengthen fiscal management at the
local level. A modernization o f the property registry was supported through a Housing
Urban Structural Adjustment Loan (HUSAL) and a Technical Adjustment Loan
(HUTAL), which emphasized the need to articulate a national strategy and establish a
new model for property registries. The strategy and the model have been defined and
implementation has begun. In addition, a contract to provide fee-for-service advice for
the modernization o f the Federal District Registry was signed in FY07.
While there was good progress on the public financial management program,
56.
some planned justice related activities have been postponed or dropped.
Nevertheless, a State Judicial Modernization loan was approved in FY05 for US$30
million. It supports the credit program o f BANOBRAS for state judicial modernization
which aims at improving the institutional performance o f state judiciaries. However,
disbursements have been delayed because BANOBRAS has been slow in concluding subloan agreements with the states. As a result, the proposed Access to Justice 11project
planned for FY07 has been dropped and analytic work on Streamlining Commercial
Justice has been delayed.

60

I

57.
IDF funded projects have been under implementation to support
transparency and combat corruption. In that context the Federal Institute for Access
to Public Information (IFAI), established in 2002, has a key role. The Strengthening of
IF’AI project aimed to strengthen institutional capacities and to extend the federal
experience to decentralized levels o f the public sector. The Creation of Laboratory of
Documentation and Analysis of Corruption project funded: (i)
the creation o f a laboratory
o f documentation and analysis o f corruption in UNAM, the national public university; (ii)
the design and implementation o f an index to measure ‘best practices’ in public sector
procurement; and (iii)
the construction o f a national system o f corruption research.
Although the latter grant was controversial because it ranked the performance o f line
ministries during a sensitive pre-electoral period, it represents an innovative example o f
Bank involvement with academia and an attempt to implement the anti-corruption
agenda. An IDF to the state o f Aguascalientes, approved in early 2007, will provide
support for statewide efforts to harmonize accounting practices, which is hoped to
provide an example for other states.

Box 4.

Bank Support for the Government Transition

As Mexico entered the 2006 presidential election, the Bank stayed engaged throughout the three phases of
the transition: pre-campaign, campaign, and actual transition. Three issues-poverty, jobs, and securitywere identified as policy priorities for Mexico. To t h i s end, the Bank consulted with political leaders and
technical teams in preparing a series o f Policy Notes and in presenting analytical work. The Policy Notes,
which were planned as part o f the CPS, were presented at a seminar with the incoming and outgoing
Ministers and served to brief the new Government. WBI organized a National F o r u m o n Democratic
Governance in Mexico in September 2006. The Bank also engaged in a strategic media presence and held
discussions with the legislative branch, the f i r s t time the Bank did so in Mexico.

Pillar IV: Environmental Sus tainability

Overview
58.
There has been significant progress on the Environmental Sustainability
pillar, especially on the policy, legal and institutionalfront. The Bank’s support aimed
to: (i)
integrate principles o f sustainable development into country policies and programs;
(ii)
address issues o f air pollution, solid waste management, clean energy technologies,
and greenhouse gas emissions; (iii)
address water scarcity problem and high rates o f
deforestation; and (iv) promote sustainable natural resource management. Instruments to
pursue this pillar o f support included programmatic analytical work, investment and
development policy loans, and a series o f GEF and PCF grants.

Given the problematic state

target i s not likely to be met

59.
Not all of the benchmark indicators for assessing progress in this pillar are
likely to be met by the end of the CPS period. The indicators are to: (i)increase
renewable energy capacity to 1,700 MW; (ii)to have at least ten projects for carbon
financing under implementation as part o f the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM); and (iii)
reduce the number o f overdrawn aquifers to less than 100.
Renewable energy capacity increased to 964 M W in 2005, and i t would require a near
doubling o f this capacity to reach the CPS target. On the other hand, there are nine
projects for carbon financing under CDM, two o f which have been developed by the
World Bank. Meanwhile, the number o f overdrawn aquifers increased over 2003-04.

Water
60.
The Bank made use of programmatic AAA as the instrument of choice for
addressing challenges to the water sector in Mexico. The report, Economic
Assessment of Policy Interventions in the Water Sector, delivered in FY06, provided a
comprehensive framework to assess and prioritize policy interventions across urban water
supply, irrigation, electricity and water pricing, among others. The Infrastructure Public
Expenditure Review, delivered in FY05, reviewed the allocation o f resources to
infrastructure, including water and sanitation. The Water Public Expenditure Review,
delivered in FY06, provides analysis and recommendations to better understand the
options for implementing the new water sector law. The analytical work has improved
understanding o f the implications o f policy interventions and enhanced public awareness
o f the seriousness o f water issues. Mexico faces a number o f challenges, including the
need to address the overexploitation o f water resources, as more than 50 percent o f the
groundwater utilized in the country comes from overexploited aquifers, a situation which
i s not sustainable in the long-run. There i s need to review policies and subsidies in terms
o f their long-term impact and to reorient them to support sustainable water resource
management. In addition there is a need to focus on water access for those without
service or with limited access.
61.
The CPS planned a series of loans to accompany the programmatic AAA, not
all of which have materialized. The Modernization of Water and Sanitation TAL
(US$25 million), approved in FY06, assists in developing the tools and instruments for
local authorities to improve water supply and sanitation services. Loan disbursements

62

initially suffered from a lack o f counterpart funding, but plans are now under way to use
the remaining hnds o f the loan during 2008. The Environmental Services project (US$45
million plus US$15 million GEF), approved in FY06, aims to enhance the provision o f
environmental services o f national and global significance and to secure their long-term

sustainability. Existing programs would be strengthened and expanded and local
payments for environmental services would be introduced in selected pilot areas.
62.
Ongoing operations in the water sector are proceeding satisfactorily. The
Decentralized Infrastructure Reform and Development Project (US$108 million),
approved in FY04, supports operational improvements and investment in the
municipalities o f the State o f Guanajuato. To date, average efficiency o f water and
sanitation services has increased, and 43 percent o f municipal water operators have
extended their service by 10 percent or more. The Integrated Irrigation Modernization
(US$303 million) project, approved in FY04, assists the Government to adopt a new
model to improve the competitiveness o f irrigated agriculture and the efficient use o f
irrigation water through the establishment o f public-private partnerships, improved
coordination within the public sector, and the adoption o f a demand-driven approach to
investment.
63.
There has been progress in terms of reaching the CPS quantitative targets
for the water sector. The number o f participatory water basin councils in operation
increased from 1 in 2001 to 16 in 2004. The number o f groundwater committees
operating increased to 41 in 2004, exceeding the goal o f 40 by the end o f the CPS period.
Access to water and sanitation has also increased. Some 88 percent o f the population now
has access to safe water and 85 percent to sewer services in 2005, reaching or surpassing
the medium-tern country targets o f 88 percent and 78 percent respectively. However,
overdrawn aquifers continue to be a problem.

The Institutional Framework for Environmental Sustainability
64.
The main instrument used by the Bank for supporting principles of
sustainable development in Mexico was a Programmatic Environmental DPL. The
government has made good progress in mainstreaming sustainability principles and the
Bank has supported this agenda since 2002 through a Programmatic Environmental DPL.
The first phase has now been completed and a second loan (US$200.5 million) was
approved in FY06. An Environmental Mainstreaming Agenda for Sustainable
Development (Agenda de Transversalidad) has now been adopted in energy, water,
forestry and tourism with a view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f local
environmental management.
65.
The second phase of the Environmental DPL supported the development of
legal and regulatory frameworks, consolidating and deepening the impact of
reforms. Progress to date on the legal and regulatory framework includes amendments
to the Water Law (approved in 2004), the enactment o f a General Law for Sustainable
Forestry Development and the passage o f the Ley General para la Prevencibn y Gestibn
Integral de 10s Residuos. A package o f legal reforms and regulations to promote
renewable energy are expected to be developed in FY08, under the third phase o f the
DPL. Other expected actions in FY08 include: increasing from 14 to 35 the number o f
tourist destinations that have local action plans; developing and publishing new
63

guidelines for public participation in environmental management; adopting a unified
energy-environment strategy, and adopting a national strategy for the mitigation o f
climate change.

Box 5.

Reducing air pollution in Mexico City

The Mexico City Insurgentes Bus Rapid Transit System (Metrobus) Project is a particularly important
instrument for environmental improvement. T h i s project is the f i s t transport initiative t o be supported
through carbon finance worldwide. The public transport system along the Insurgentes corridor carries
220,000 passengers per day and has reduced greenhouse gas emissions during its f i s t year by some 30,000
tons o f C 0 2 equivalent. The Bank has purchased these emission reductions through an ERPA (Emission
Reduction Purchase Agreement). The project has also helped achieve a considerable reduction in local
pollutants: a 23% reduction in particulate matter and a 50% reduction in CO. The traveling public has
made significant changes in its mode o f transport (approx 15% of them n o w use Metrobus rather than their
vehicles). Traffic congestion has been reduced along the corridor, with dedicated lanes and restrictions o n
vehicles. As a result o f these successes, the government is currently considering an agreement for the
purchase o f additional emission reductions consequent upon expanding the rapid transit bus system to an
additional 10 corridors in Mexico City.

66.
A number of GEF and PCF grants have been made in support of measures to
reduce air pollution, improve solid waste management, promote clean energy
technologies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. N e w projects undertaken during
the CPS period relate to Methane Gas Capture, Large Scale Renewable Energy, and
Climate Friendly Measures in Transport. The Methane Gas Capture project has
supported the design, construction, and operation o f the first ever methane gas power
plant in Latin America to incorporate local and global environmental concerns. Using
landfill gas that would have otherwise been released into the atmosphere, the project i s
powering city lights at night and the public transport system during the day in Monterrey.
To date, approx 0.9 million tons o f C 0 2 equivalent have been eliminated as a result o f
the project. Building upon this success, the Bank has agreed to purchase emission
reductions o f the expanded Monterrey landfill site. The project i s being replicated in the
State o f Aguascalientes and could be extended to a number o f other cities. The Climate
Friendly Measures in Transport (FY03) has helped design policies and measures to shift
transport in Mexico City toward more climate-friendly, efficient and less polluting,
modalities. In FY06, a Carbon Finance grant financed analytical support for the design
and implementation o f Bus Rapid Transit systems in Mexico City. Overall, there have
been more GEF and carbon finance programs than originally planned in the CPS. In
addition, IFC made a U S $ 15 million equity investment in a pioneering carbon trade
project in Mexico, along with other countries in Latin America, for the sale o f reduced
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the treatment o f animal manure in farms.

Renewable Energy
67.
The GEF and PCF have also funded renewable energy projects which have
contributed to a reduction in pollution. In 2005 construction was begun o n L a Venta 11,
the first large-scale wind power plant in Mexico (83 MW) located in the state o f Oaxaca.

64

This plant began operations in October 2006 and is being supported by carbon credits
through the Bank’s carbon finance program. A previous project, L a Venta I, was
constructed on a pilot basis but L a Venta 11 is the first independent power purchase
project for wind in Mexico. The recently approved Wind Umbrella (FY07) aims to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions from power generation and promote investment in wind energy
by supporting the first large-scale investment in wind energy. In FY06, the Large-Scale
Renewable Energy Development project was approved. Its goal is to promote large-scale
grid-connected wind energy in Mexico’s southern states (Oaxaca), which have worldclass wind resources. An incentive will be given to producers o f RE power through the
Green Fund, a financial mechanism that will provide resources for renewable energy
projects that reduce risks in energy supply, foster energy price stability, and benefit the
regional and global environment. These issues were also addressed in policy notes
submitted to the incoming Calderon administration.

Forestry
68.
The Bank supported Mexico’s efforts to address deforestation through the
ongoing Community Forestry 11 loan. The first Community Forestry project, which
closed in FY04 supported the Government’s natural resource management strategy and
increased the scope o f forestry-based income. An international seminar on community
forestry sponsored by the project, contributed significantly to shaping policy with respect
to national forests (particularly the National Forestry L a w passed by Congress in
December 2002). It also helped to develop the National Forest Information System
which provides information on such issues as forest inventories, data on plantations,
information on forest fire prevention, pest control, and legislation. The Community
Forestry 11project (FY04) has assisted indigenous communities and ejidos (community
managed lands) to strengthen community ties and better manage their forest resources in
order to diversify forest-based production, create and strengthen community enterprises
and increase incomes. Project progress has generally been good, although slower than
expected in some components. A third phase, planned for FY09, would extend the
program to more states.

IV. OVERALL BANK PERFORMANCE

A. The Lending Program
69.
The CPS was predicated on the premise that Bank lending to middle income
countries must be flexible and responsive to changing country circumstances.
Hence, a discrepancy o f detailed content between the initial CPS program and actual
outcomes i s not, in itself, a cause for concern. However, the lending program followed
an unforeseen stepwise path over the period FY05-08. The first two years o f lending in
FY05-06 were broadly consistent with the recent past and with the CPS. In FY07,
however, there was an abrupt drop in lending with only one loan being approved for an
amount o f US$29 million. The outlook for FY08 is for a somewhat more active lending
program but the total i s unlikely to be much more than one quarter o f the US$1,200
million envisaged in the base case scenario o f the CPS.
65

70.
There are several reasons for the abrupt FY07 drop in lending. The elections
o f 2006 were a source o f exceptional uncertainty in Mexico and many administrative and
project decisions were “put on hold”. The Government made use o f buoyant foreign
exchange reserves to prepay loans from the Bank and the IDB. Prepayments to the Bank
in an amount o f US$5.1 billion reduced the country’s outstanding IBRD debt by 56
percent from the outstanding balance o f US$9.1 billion as o f September 2006. According
to the analysis o f IMF staff, the prepayment operation l e f t unchanged “the net external
debt and the net domestic debt of the consolidated public sector, while generating interest
savings (essentially because the interest cost of the prepaid external debt exceeded the
interest earnings on NIR)”.l3International rating agencies have praised the government

for replacing foreign currency with local debt and have upgraded its sovereign credit
rating. W h i l e the prepayment was not specifically tied to any change o f plan with respect
to new borrowing from the Bank, i t clearly affected the overall dynamic o f the
relationship. Furthermore, the Bank itself was going through an unsettling period at the
time with the resignation o f the president and a change o f country director and that may
also have impacted the program.
71.
The prepayment o f IBRD loans and the FY07 drop in lending does not presage a
rupture in the Bank’s relationship with Mexico but rather a change in the dynamic o f that
relationship. There i s s t i l l an active portfolio o f Bank-supported projects being
implemented as well as an active program o f AAA all o f which engender a broad range
o f Bank-client relationships at both the operational and policy levels. There is, therefore,
fertile ground for restoring a program o f significant size consistent with country
requirements.
72.
Furthermore, the Bank has been and remains price-competitive as a source o f
external finance for Mexico. Diagram 1 below shows that the yield on Mexican
government bonds issued in 2005 and 2006 was significantly higher than the charges on
Bank loans. Hence Bank presented a cheaper alternative source o f finance for the
government.

Diagram 2 below shows the yield o f government 10 year bonds on the secondary
market during the four year period 2004-08. The spread over USD LIBOR has exceeded
the cost o f Bank loans by a significant margin except for a very brief period in 2007. As
o f January 4,2008 the secondary market spread o n government 10 year bonds was 79-88
basis points greater than the corresponding cost o f Bank loans.

74.
For its part, IFC sharpened i t s focus on high impact areas, responding to the
upgrading o f Mexico’s sovereign credit ratings and the return o f liquidity in the Mexican
market. IFC commitments were US$266.0 million per year on average in FY05-07,
following the historic high o f US$447 million reached in FY04 when demand for IFC’s
assistance was elevated due to the scarcity o f long-term financing caused by a capital
retreat from Latin America in the preceding years. Similarly, funding from international
banks through the B loan program decreased significantly during this period to US$17.5
million.
75.
Total lending in FYOS-OS reached US$2.7 billion through the first half of
F Y O S . I t i s difficult to compare planned and actual outcomes for lending by pillars
because many operations serve multiple objectives. Subject to that reservation, however,
it would appear that actual lending operations for the poverty and competitiveness pillars
were close to planned levels, but lending for the environment pillar was significantly less
than originally envisaged. Two loans programmed for FY07, Water Policy Development
DPL & TAL, and Water Rights were dropped and a third, Environmental Management,
has been postponed to FY10.
76.
There were significant differences between planned GEF and PCF grants
and actual deliveries during the CPS period. O f ten planned activities for FY05-08,
three have been dropped but, at the same time, several projects that were not planned in
the CPS have been approved in FY06 and are planned for FY07 and FY08. This
discrepancy i s consistent with operational needs in cutting-edge areas where the
requirements o f the client country are constantly reassessed on the basis o f experience in
the field. More importantly, outcomes o f the activities supported by GEF and PCF grants
have been generally very positive.

B. Portfolio Quality
77.
The quality of the portfolio was satisfactory throughout the CPS period. The
disbursement ratio averaged 28 percent during the first three years covered by the CPS.
This was higher than the regional average for FY05 and FY06, and rose considerably in
FY06, to 35 percent, in part because o f four development policy loans disbursed that
year. The statistics for problem projects, projects at risk and commitments at risk are in
general better than the regional average.
78.
Since March 2004 the average lag between loan approval and loan
effectiveness was 8.8 months which i s somewhat higher than the Regional average of
8.2 months. Following the Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR) conducted
in FY05 and FY06, actions have been taken to speed up project implementation and
effectiveness.
79.
The portfolio had four problem projects of which three pre-dated the 2004
CAS. There were also significant cancellations during the CPS period, with US$596m
cancelled in FY05, the second highest amount in the Bank in that year. O f particular
significance were cancellations relating to a municipal development project and an ebusiness project.

C. Programmatic Advisory and Analytical Activities (AAA)
82.
The CPS gave prominence to AAA in keeping with the Bank’s M I C strategy.
The Government’s reform agenda provided the key point of departure for AAA.
The programmatic structure resulted in a coherent approach to analytic work and
69

facilitated the process o f debate and consensus with respect to the reform agenda. The
Government has recognized the high-quality o f Bank analysis. The catalytic role o f the
Bank and the increasingly participatory nature o f AAA have led to greater ownership o f
the recommendations by key stakeholders. The broad framework o f the analytical
agenda has also led to correspondingly broad exchanges between the Bank, government
officials, Mexican academia and other institutions. Significant efforts were made during
the CPS period to improve dissemination, with several reports widely disseminated and
debated. Analytic work provided opportunities for stocktaking and raising awareness o f
key issues, as well as pointing the way to approaches that could be adopted by the
Government. The number o f AAA translated into Spanish increased and, in many
instances when reports were not translated, the executive summaries were. This is a
marked improvement compared with past World Bank analytical work for Mexico which
previously suffered from weak dissemination and limited translation o f report^.'^

0. Fee-based Services
83.
The CPS foresaw a continued use of fee-based services. In the CPS period,
paid advisory services were undertaken in support o f (i)
institutional reform o f toll roads
(FY06-07); (ii)analysis o f the mortgage market at the request o f the Sociedad
Hipotecaria Federal (FY06); (iii)
the Government o f the Federal District in its efforts to
improve competitiveness (FY06); and (iv) modernization o f the accounting information
system for SHCP (FY06). There are likely to be additional advisory services before the
end o f the CPS period. The steady increase in the provision o f fee-based services has
been client-driven and is indicative o f the client’s high regard for the breadth and depth
o f international experience that the Bank i s able to bring to the table.

E. Safeguards and Fiduciary
84.
The CPS expressed the desire o f the Bank and the government to move
towards greater reliance on country processes in procurement, financial
management and safeguards. Country systems are already being used in most areas o f
project financial management and partially employed in procurement, and the Bank is
continuing to work with the government and the Inter-American Development Bank
l4This was the conclusion o f the QAG Country AAA Assessment, covering the period FY01-03, and
continued t o be true for the following years.
l 5 Includes non-lending technical assistance and supplemental tasks.

70

(IDB) to improve the procurement system and harmonize financial management
requirements around existing country processes. In procurement, Bank-financed projects
have partially employed the Government’s systems.

F. Financial Instruments
85.
Collaboration with the Government during the previous CAS and the current CPS
period has focused on the use o f the Bank’s menu o f lending and non-lending products to
manage the Government’s financial risks within the context o f Mexico’s sovereign debt
management strategy. In this regard, the Bank and the Government have finalized the
negotiation o f a Master Derivative Agreement (MDA), to be signed early in 2008, which
will enhance Mexico’s capacity to manage the financial risks in its debt portfolio by
having access to a range o f Bank hedging products. These products can be used not only
for Bank obligations, but also to manage the financial risks o f other sovereign liabilities.
In addition, a high priority was given to the use o f World Bank financial products in
order to transform the Bank obligation o f Mexican States and local governments into
Mexican Pesos, and providing access to Bank funding and technical assistance through
on-lending programs via Mexico’s national development banks.
86.
Mexico was the first country, both regionally as well as globally, to take
advantage of the World Bank’s local currency financing facility. So far the loan
agreements for the following projects have employed this feature: the Decentralized
Infrastructure Reform and Development and State Judicial Modernization (both approved
in FY04), and a US$9 million component o f the Tertiary Education Student Assistance
(approved in FY06 but dropped in FY07). In all three cases, the ultimate beneficiary o f
the World Bank’s financing i s not the Federal Government, but Mexican states which can
access long term peso financing at competitive terms through this arrangement. By end2007, four disbursements in pesos had been made equivalent to US$88 million for the
Decentralized Reform and Development Project, allowing the Government o f the State o f
Guanajuato to obtain local currency fbnding with a final maturity o f 18 years and a 3year grace period. Pricing was referenced to 182-day Certzjkados del Tesoro (Le., 6month Mexican Treasury rate) with a fixed spread based on market conditions when the
loan disbursements took place.
In the course o f the CPS period and with buoyant foreign exchange reserves the
87.
government became increasingly cost conscious with respect to borrowing from abroad.
Financial cost issues were one factor contributing to the reduction in Bank lending at a
time when Mexico enjoyed buoyant foreign exchange reserves. In September 2007 the
Bank simplified its loan structure and cut lending rates with the intent o f making the
Bank “better, faster and cheaper”. As a result, the average cost saving i s about 17 basis
points for DPLs and 32 basis points for investment loans, with the previous complex
system o f charges and waivers having been eliminated. The new financial arrangements
should make the Bank’s financial products more attractive to Mexican governments, both
federal and local. The Bank will also extend maturities available to borrowers for up to
30 years, fbrther improving the competitiveness o f Bank loans.

71

G. Collaboration with Other Donors
88.
There are numerous examples o f successhl collaboration between the World
Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is the most active
development partner o f the Bank and the Government. There has been collaboration in
the education sector, social protection, training, procurement, project financial
management, public administration and housing. During the CPS period, this has
included joint work to standardize bidding documents, as well as collaborating o n the
evaluation o f the Federal Government’s procurement policies and practices. In addition,
there has also been joint support for financial sector reforms with complementary policy
based loans, together with coordination in financial management aimed at harmonizing
auditor selection processes and audit terms o f references by jointly working with the
Secretariat o f Public Administration (SFP) which supervises project auditing.

V. LESSONS LEARNED
89.
Reference has already been made to the need, clearly acknowledged in the CPS
for the Bank to be “flexible to respond to windows o f opportunity which may arise during
the CPS period”. Experience confirms that lesson and indicates that there are multiple
facets to the principle o f flexibility that should be applied. Recently, the Bank has
adopted guidelines for increased flexibility for well-performing middle income countries.
0

Lesson: The experience o f implementing the 2004 CPS suggests that a flexible
CPS i s an appropriate way to structure the Bank’s program in Mexico. I t has
already led to positive outcomes. Innovative thinking i s an important facet o f
flexibility.

90.
N o w that Mexico has effectively made the transition to a multi-party democracy,
Government policies and programs are more likely to be affected by the electoral cycle
than was previously the case. The 2007 presidential elections and the transition period
that followed clearly affected the interest o f the Government in new borrowing and the
implied policy commitments.

The Bank should align the time-frame o f the country strategy with the electoral
cycle to better ensure policy continuity during program implementation. That
would have the additional advantage o f aligning the time-frame o f the CPS with
the national development plan.

91.
With an increasingly strong external financial position, the Government has
become more cost-conscious in borrowing from abroad.
0

The Bank should communicate clearly to the Government and to c i v i l society in
Mexico that i t has been and continues to be a price-competitive source o f foreign
exchange finance. The Bank should also make hll use o f recently introduced,
streamlined and lower-cost lending instruments in designing its lending program.

92.
I t has proven very difficult to separate out clearly the contribution o f the Bank to
overall country outcomes. Indicators that attribute results to the Bank program o f support
are difficult to design and monitor.

72

0

Lesson: In middle income countries such as Mexico, the Bank should
acknowledge that CPS outcomes primarily reflect the efforts o f the Government
and the country.

93.
AAA has played an important and growing role in the country relationship with
Mexico. In many cases, free-standing AAA can contribute directly to the Government’s
development effort. In other cases, an effective way to take the country development
program forward is to structure Bank-supported projects that can serve as a framework
for implementing the findings o f AAA. The project structure and the disciplined
procedures associated with that structure can be helphl to the Government even though i t
may have no need to borrow for purposes o f resource transfer.
0

Lesson: Where applicable, the symbiotic role o f AAA and lending should
continue to be used in Mexico as a framework for developing a more complete
program o f Bank support.

94.
Projects supported by Bank lending sometimes encountered problems o f
contracting and procurement. The view o f the Mexican authorities i s that their own
procurement procedures are well developed and effective.
0

Lesson: The Bank should focus on streamlining its contracting and procurement
requirements and should incorporate country systems to the extent possible.

95.
In many cases Bank assistance has effectively mobilized international expertise
on key development issues o f interest to Mexico.
0

Lesson: The Bank should work closely with other international agencies in i t s
program o f assistance to Mexico.

Annex D Fiduciary Aspects
1.
Use of Country Systems. Under the G O M i s non-additionality principle, Bank financing i s
used to reimburse program expenditures already budgeted and executed by the sectoral entities.
Therefore, in Mexico the public financial management (PFM) systems are largely used in Bank
investment operations, with minor areas o f opportunity in the streamlining o f reports for
disbursement, financial monitoring, and audit purposes. However, PFM objectives go beyond
those o f specific investment projects.
2.
In procurement, significant progress has been made towards bringing Mexican systems
closer to international good practices. COMPRANET was certified for use in Bank projects for
both I C B and NCB, and harmonized documents for procurement o f goods, civil works and
consultants in Bank and IDB projects were adopted. These documents include elements o f local
law and were adopted by Mexico as national documents for projects financed by Multilateral
Banks. Small procurement (similar to shopping) already follows local law and Mexico's
regulatory body i s one o f the best in the region. Mexico i s the first country in the region where
the Bank has applied the O E C D D A C indicators to the national procurement system, which will
serve as the basis for making decisions on Country Systems, in the event that a policy i s
approved by the Bank's board.

3.

Fiduciary Development Issues. In terms o f i t s developmental stage, Mexico should aim
at continuing improvement o f its PFM systems in order to reach convergence with OECD-type

good practice and standards on budgeting, treasury, accounting, controls and audits. These are
areas where, based on its international expertise, the Bank can add significant value through
lending andor non-lending services, while at the same time contributing to support the fiduciary
underpinnings of DPL lending, operationalization o f the G A C strategy, and progress towards
Paris harmonization targets.

4.
In procurement, the Bank recently completed 2 CPAR, jointly with the IDB. The teams
are advising the Government not only on typical procurement areas but also on how to ensure
that the procurement system supports the GOM's economic development plan. There i s
considerable room for improvement in Government's priority areas that would modernize the
system and make i t more adaptable to the fast changing market and procurement environments.
The recommendations aim to align the system with the Government's objectives and make i t
more open to competition and more efficient. The proposed reforms would generate significant
savings to the Government by reducing the transaction costs and, most importantly, by reducing
prices o f Government purchases. Moreover, the proposed reforms would enhance the
transparency, predictability and public trust in the system.
5.
As the CPS period matures, and the streamlined lending approach is fblly implemented,
the portfolio o f Bank investment loans will shrink substantially. Fiduciary issues, however, are
likely to be a part o f the ongoing policy dialogue on public administration reforms over the
coming years.
