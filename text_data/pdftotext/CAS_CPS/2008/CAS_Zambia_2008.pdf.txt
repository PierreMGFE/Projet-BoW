Executive Summary
i.
As Zambia’s export market for copper has boomed and its debt burden has eased under relief
initiatives, the economy has moved from stagnation and dependence on aid toward steadier growth,
greater prosperity, and readier access to domestic and foreign investment. But the sources and benefits of
growth have been narrowly focused. Mining, construction, and service sectors have driven the expansion
of GDP at 5–6 percent a year since 2000, while the rural economy has stalled. Despite almost a decade of
growth and even longer experience with peaceful, democratic government, almost two-thirds of Zambians
live in poverty, and rural people persistently lag behind urban dwellers in most measures of social
welfare.
ii.
Accelerating economic growth and ensuring that the majority of Zambia’s population can benefit
from this growth remain Zambia’s central development challenges. The government’s strategy to reduce
poverty and reach middle-income status by 2030 is articulated in its Vision 2030 and Fifth National
Development Plan (FNDP), which outlines an agenda of actions for 2006–10. The World Bank Group’s
Country Assistance Strategy in Zambia during fiscal 2008–11 is designed to help the government achieve
its objectives through highly selective and targeted interventions that maximize the impact of the
government’s own resources and programs and adhere to principles agreed upon by all the partners
supporting Zambia’s development efforts.
A. Zambia’s Development Challenges
iii.
Accelerating Growth. Zambia needs to expand its economy faster than its current rate of 6
percent a year to achieve the national vision of becoming a middle-income economy by 2030. In addition,
the growth needs to be diversified, as Zambia’s continued dependence on copper exports creates risks and
is unlikely to generate the jobs and income levels needed to achieve its goals. Ensuring that revenues
generated by the copper sector are used to build productive infrastructure, support delivery of social
services, and diversify the economy, thereby laying a more sustainable foundation for development will
be critical. Still, Zambia has great potential for future growth: it’s mineral and agricultural resources have
not been fully utilized, and most of the substantial water resources are unused. Furthermore, its
macroeconomic performance has been positive, and inflation has fallen to single digits, its lowest level in
three decades.
iv.
Sharing Growth. Despite efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability and diversify the economy,
rural areas have suffered from years of development neglect. Underlying the slow pace of development is
a chronic lack of investment in infrastructure and services—both hard (roads, energy, information and
communication technologies) and soft (skills, health, markets)—and the poor investment climate,
resulting from the slow pace of implementing much needed structural reforms, such as those dealing with
the system of land tenure, labor regulations, and the energy and telecommunications sectors. About 65
percent of the population has no access to finance; more than 50 percent of rural households still live
more than 5 kilometers from the nearest health facility; only 8 percent are within 5 kilometers of a
secondary school; and about half of the rural households have to travel more than 25 kilometers to reach
an input market.
v.
Improving Competitiveness. Accelerating growth will depend on Zambia’s ability to become
more competitive; it ranks 117th out of 128 countries included in the 2007 Global Competitiveness

i

Index.1 The efficiency with which Zambian firms use direct inputs, such as labor and capital, to produce
goods is low relative to other countries, and it drops dramatically when indirect costs, such as
infrastructure and dealing with red tape, are factored in. Productivity problems are especially acute in the
smallholder agriculture sector, where poverty in concentrated.
vi.
Addressing Structural Constraints. Three clusters of constraints are particularly binding for
businesses in Zambia: physical infrastructure, human resources, and institutional capacity. The poor
quality and high cost of transport, communications, and power make it extremely difficult for Zambian
enterprises to compete. In addition, the low levels of health, education, and entrepreneurial skills prevent
most citizens from taking advantage of the economic liberalization and improved investment
opportunities. Finally, Zambia’s public administration and legal system, including the enabling
environment for business, needs improvement.
vii.
Improving Governance. Zambia ranks almost precisely at the midpoint of over 100 low- and
middle-income countries in the quality of its checks and balances and bureaucratic institutions. Even with
a full array of formal rules, laws, courts, legislature, and enforcement agencies, Zambia’s formal
institutions need strengthening and corruption remains a problem. Furthermore, governance shortcomings
have undermined the business environment, notably in the day-to-day burden imposed by the bureaucracy
on enterprise managers and in the unreliability of the electricity infrastructure.
B. The Government’s Strategy for Inclusive Growth
viii.
Improving competitiveness and productivity lies at the heart of the government’s development
strategy for 2006–10, as set out in its Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP). The FNDP proposes a
multisectoral strategy for increasing Zambia’s annual growth rate to 7 percent, sustaining it at that level,
and making growth more inclusive. The strategy emphasizes:
•

•

•

Macroeconomic and expenditure management. The FNDP proposes a detailed medium-term
expenditure framework. Cooperating partners are increasingly urged to support it by providing
predictable assistance through direct budget support and by moving away from traditional, individual
projects toward a sector wide approach. On fiscal policy, the FNDP appropriately identifies the need
to improve budget execution, strengthen financial accountability and expenditure monitoring, and
enhance the revenue base. The overall objective of monetary policy is to achieve and maintain singledigit inflation during the period of the plan.
Institutional capacity enhancement. The FNDP seeks to improve and institutionalize political,
administrative, financial, and budgetary transparency and accountability. The governance goals listed
in the strategy include increasing access to justice; strengthening collaboration and cooperation
among governance institutions; enhancing constitutionalism and the rule of law; and institutionalizing
anticorruption programs in all public institutions by 2010.
Infrastructure development. The FNDP targets increased expenditures on road and rail infrastructure
and highlights the urgency of investing in new hydroelectric power stations and implementing a
power rehabilitation program, including rural electrification. The plan notes, however, that the public
purse cannot undertake all the investments needed and identifies public-private partnerships as an
important mechanism to realize these investments.

•

Social sector development. The FNDP recognizes that spending on health and education, in a country
with a high incidence of malaria and HIV/AIDS and a shortage of skilled labor not only can improve
social welfare but also can spur economic growth. It acknowledges that the quality of education needs
further improvement and highlights the current human resources crisis in the health sector. To
improve the availability of essential drugs and medical supplies the plan advocates stronger
collaboration among health agencies on budget planning and procurement.

C. The World Bank Group Program
ix. The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Zambia for fiscal 2008–11 is closely
aligned with the government's objectives, with two areas of special emphasis. First, because of the
potential fiscal windfall coming from the boom in copper export prices, the CAS supports improved
expenditure management and close collaboration and monitoring with the government and local
stakeholders to ensure that those revenues are used wisely and effectively to benefit as many households
as possible. Second, because of the significant gaps between urban and rural areas, and the need for
increased access to regional markets, the CAS supports a program of investments in infrastructure that
will increase economic opportunities for all Zambians through improved connectivity and integration,
resulting in increased competitiveness. Although IDA 15 country allocations are not yet available, an
annual lending program in the range of US$80-100 million is envisaged, with 15-20 percent of the
resources going towards direct budget support. Actual allocations during the CAS period will be
determined on an annual basis and will depend on: (i) Zambia’s performance rating; (ii) the terms of
IDA's assistance to the Zambia (credits or grants); (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA
borrowers; (iv) total IDA resources available in IDA15 and IDA16; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible
countries.
x.
The current program will be guided by the lessons learned in implementing previous programs in
Zambia, where Bank projects have had a mixed record of success, reflecting both weak implementation
capacity and insufficient drive to attain ambitious project development objectives. To remedy those
problems, the CAS focuses on narrow, achievable goals and strives to ensure that the incentives of
stakeholders, both in the government and in the broader society, are well aligned with the goals supported
by the World Bank Group and the cooperating partners.
xi.
The Bank’s comparative advantage lies in its ability to focus development resources and priorities
on these critical areas targeted in the CAS by using its convening power to leverage scarce IDA resources.
Thus, the CAS stresses the need for selectivity, prioritization, and an enhanced focus on results,
monitoring, and evaluation.
xii.
Targeted outcomes for the CAS are closely tied to the four priority areas identified in Zambia’s
latest national development plan:
• Macroeconomic and expenditure management. A core objective of the Bank’s macroeconomic program
over the CAS period will be to help Zambia better manage its financial resources, particularly given the
substantial revenues expected to flow from copper so that such resources can support the inclusive
growth agenda. The focus going forward will include managing the macroeconomic consequences of
the expected additional inflows from copper (e.g. Dutch Disease); improving accountability and
transparency in the management of revenues, building on the Government’s interest in implementing
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative; investigating how sectoral expenditure policies can
contribute to growth and poverty reduction; and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of large
parastatals.
• Infrastructure development. The Bank’s infrastructure goals are to improve connectivity and expand the
economy’s production potential in agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining sectors. Improved

iii

connectivity will also better integrate rural communities into the national economy and Zambia into the
regional and global economy. Activities will focus largely on energy (new transmission and generation
capacity, increased access, and assistance to improve the efficiency of service delivery), transport
(analysis of transport cost drivers, financing to improve the road network, and policy review to align
sector priorities with the national poverty reduction strategy), and water supply and sanitation
(strengthening the institutional and policy frameworks and improving delivery systems).
• Institutional capacity enhancement. Recent analytical work undertaken by the Bank concludes that
Zambia’s development policymaking needs to take local governance realities into account more
systematically, rather than striving for unachievable “optimal” policies. Therefore, the approach of this
CAS is to seek out institutional reform options that can be implemented, given the realities of Zambia’s
political economy, and focus engagement narrowly, targeting specific interventions. Ongoing
components include (i) the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Program,
which aims to improve government capacity to mobilize and efficiently use public resources and
strengthen financial accountability; and (ii) the Financial and Private Sector Development Program,
which aims to improve the business environment and increase the competitiveness of firms.
• Social sector development. The government has indicated that it would prefer to use scarce IDA
resources for financing infrastructure and will finance social sector interventions either through its own
resources or through grant financing. It is therefore intended that over the 2008–11 CAS, the Bank will
focus on analytical activities in the social sectors for which there is significant demand from the
authorities, while managing grant funding associated with global programs and grants provided by
bilateral cooperating partners. In education, proposed analytical work will identify key issues and help
formulate strategies for post-basic education, particularly its relation to technical and vocational
education and training. In health, the CAS will continue to provide support to the Ministry of Health
and the National AIDS Council on health system strategy and planning. In social protection, emphasis
will be placed on understanding the dynamics of the informal labor market.
During the CAS period, the International Finance Corporation expects to increase its engagement in
Zambia. Opportunities identified in the agribusiness, tourism, financial, energy, mining, and commercial
real estate development sectors are now being assessed for investment viability. Technical assistance to
promote development of small and medium-size enterprises and improve access to finance is also being
considered. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency also expects to increase its presence in
Zambia by providing an enabling environment for facilitation of private sector investments in areas such
as power generation and agribusiness.
D. Working Together To Improve the Effectiveness of Aid
xiii.
The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy will work in partnership with the Zambian
government and other cooperating development partners to improve the effectiveness of aid and achieve
results that advance Zambia’s national objectives for rapid, equitable growth.
xiv.
Good Governance and Anticorruption Agenda. Zambia continues to wrestle with significant
governance challenges and ranks among Sub-Saharan Africa’s poorer performers in the control of
corruption. Over the upcoming CAS period, the World Bank Group will respond proactively to these
realities by making a special effort to apply emerging good governance and anticorruption practices in the
country program, including (a) smart project design to emphasize transparency, participation, and thirdparty monitoring, (b) ongoing outreach to stakeholders and proactive supervision during project
implementation, and (c) synergies with Bank operations to strengthen country systems.
xv.
Aid Coordination, Harmonization, and Consultation. Throughout the CAS period, the World
Bank Group intends to collaborate with its international and Zambian partners to better manage our
development cooperation and align our assistance with local needs. The Bank will continue to support the

iv

Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia, which was prepared in April 2007 and signed by sixteen
cooperating partners.2 Cooperating partners recognize that a fully subscribed JASZ provides a unique
opportunity to develop a joint analytical and programmatic response to the FNDP.
xvi.
As an input into the CAS, the Bank also conducted a client survey in June 2007. Reflecting the
views of more than 300 participants in Zambia, the survey showed that the Bank’s financial resources,
knowledge, and technical advice had the greatest value for local stakeholders. Nearly three-quarters of all
respondents felt that the Bank should provide greater support for rural areas in Zambia in the next few
years. In addition to the survey, consultations were also held with various government agencies, civil
society organizations, and representatives from the private sector and cooperating partners. Overall, these
discussions confirmed that the Bank’s focus on promoting growth, improving infrastructure, upgrading
public expenditure management, reducing the cost of doing business, and strengthening the agriculture
sector was appropriate and well aligned with the objectives of the FNDP.
xvii. Managing Effectively for Results. Learning from the experience described in past CAS
completion reports, a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan has been developed for this CAS, which
assigns clear responsibilities for each CAS outcome indicator, including milestones and sources of data.
To promote transparency in results and results monitoring, it is intended that intermediary and final
results from Bank-financed interventions will be made available to the public by posting results on the
Zambia Country Office website, as well as actively contributing to the Africa Results Monitoring
System.3 To focus on results and on monitoring and evaluation, a Monitoring and Evaluation Practice
Group will be established to take the process of managing for results to the next level.
xviii. Risks and Mitigation. Although the overall outlook for Zambia remains broadly positive, the
country faces several risks in implementing its development strategy. These include (a) political economy
risk, owing to Zambia’s record of slow action in implementing past reforms, which could lead to
insufficient support for the FNDP; (b) capacity risk, due to the country’s limited analytical and
administrative skill, which could lead to delays or unresponsive implementation; (c) external shocks risk,
especially fluctuations in the price of copper and petroleum, which could adversely affect the country’s
balance of payments position and, together with increases in food prices induced by climate shocks,
undermine the recent progress Zambia has made in reducing inflation; (d) mineral wealth risk, which if
not managed properly could result in the economy exhibiting Dutch Disease symptoms; (e) energy sector
risk, due to increasingly severe shortages of electrical power, which could undermine growth objectives,
unless the shortages are addressed urgently, and (f) HIV/AIDS risk, given the high prevalence of the
disease, which could devastate human resources unless the government continues the excellent effort that
has so far gone into preventing and combating the disease.
xix.
While these risks might appear to be daunting, they are not insurmountable. As a result of good
economic management, Zambia’s economic performance during the past several years has been
commendable, and the current boom has lifted many Zambians, especially in urban areas, out of poverty.
This progress needs to be consolidated, and it is imperative that Government address the structural reform
agenda and create an environment that will allow all Zambians to participate in and benefit from this
growth. The World Bank Group, in collaboration with Zambia’s Cooperating Partners, stands ready to
support Government in this effort.

Zambia: Country Assistance Strategy
Accelerating and Sharing Growth through Improved Competitiveness
“By 2030, Zambians aspire to live in a strong and dynamic middle-income industrial nation that provides
opportunities for improving the well-being of all, embodying values of socio-economic justice,
underpinned by the principles of (i) gender responsive sustainable development; (ii) democracy; (iii)
respect for human rights; (iv) good traditional and family values; (v) positive attitude towards work; (vi)
peaceful coexistence; and (vii) private-public partnerships.”
Vision 2030: A Prosperous Middle-Income Nation by 2030, Republic of Zambia.

1.

The latest World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for Zambia looks forward to a period of great
potential and transition, as Zambia’s economy moves from stagnation and dependence on aid toward
steadier growth, greater prosperity, and readier access to domestic and foreign investment. In recent years,
Zambia’s export market for copper has boomed, creating a windfall of resources that can be tapped for
domestic investment and its debt burden has eased under relief initiatives, improving the country’s access
to foreign investments as well. But so far, the sources and benefits of growth have been narrowly focused.
Mining, construction, and service sectors have driven the expansion of GDP at 5–6 percent a year since
2000, while the rural economy has stalled. Despite almost a decade of growth and even longer experience
with peaceful, democratic government, almost two-thirds of Zambians live in poverty, and rural people
persistently lag behind urban dwellers in most measures of social welfare.

2.

The Zambian government has ambitious plans to accelerate and share economic growth,
described in its Vision 2030 and its Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP). Approved in December
2006, the FNDP, which covers 2006–10,4 is organized around the theme of “broad-based wealth and job
creation through citizenry participation and technological advancement.” Specific development goals are
to foster a competitive and outward-oriented economy to significantly reduce hunger and poverty and
reach middle-income status by 2030.

3.
The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), covering fiscal 2008–11, is
designed to help the government achieve its goals and to adhere to the principles agreed upon by all the
partners supporting Zambia’s development efforts, as articulated in the Joint Assistance Strategy for
Zambia. Nonetheless, the current strategy itself reflects a kind of transition: from the broad goals of
previous strategies, which sometimes went unrealized, to an emphasis on specific, achievable objectives;
from a broad based lending program to a more focused one that complements the country’s new access to
other financial resources and debt relief and to more targeted analytical support that will guide and
strengthen the government’s own resources and programs.
4.

Thus, the Bank’s strategy comprises highly selective and targeted interventions that maximize the
impact of the government’s development efforts, with two areas of special emphasis. First, because of the
potential fiscal windfall coming from the boom in copper prices, the CAS supports improved expenditure
management and close collaboration and monitoring with the government and local stakeholders to
ensure that those revenues are used wisely and effectively to benefit as many households as possible.
Second, because of the significant gaps between urban and rural areas, and the need for increased access
to regional markets, the CAS supports a program of investments in infrastructure that will increase

extended to 2005.

economic opportunities for all Zambians through improved connectivity and integration, resulting in
increased competitiveness.

5.
The current program is guided by the lessons learned in implementing previous programs in
Zambia, where Bank projects have had a mixed record of success, reflecting both weak implementation
capacity and insufficient drive to attain ambitious project development objectives. To remedy those
problems, the CAS focuses on narrow, achievable goals and strives to ensure that the incentives of
stakeholders, both in the government and in the broader society, are well aligned with the goals supported
by the World Bank Group and the cooperating partners.
6.
The Bank’s comparative advantage lies fundamentally in its ability to focus development
resources and priorities on these critical areas targeted in the CAS by using its convening power to
leverage scarce IDA resources. Thus, the CAS stresses the need for selectivity, prioritization, and an
enhanced focus on results, monitoring, and evaluation.
I. The Context for Change in Zambia
7.

Zambia is a peaceful, democratic country with enormous economic potential, now grounded in its
rich endowment of natural resources. Yet, almost two-thirds of Zambians live in poverty, and rural people
persistently lag behind urban dwellers in most measures of social welfare. Current political, social, and
economic conditions present several challenges as well as opportunities for achieving the government’s
Vision 2030 and the Millennium Development Goals.
A. Political Conditions
8.
Zambia has benefited from 16 years of democratic governance. The country has held national
multiparty elections in 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006. In the 2006 poll, President Levy Mwanawasa was
re-elected, and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) party retained its parliamentary
majority, albeit narrowly. International and domestic observers reported that the 2006 elections, unlike
those of 2001, were substantially free of irregularities. Indeed, clear improvements were registered, not
only in election-day activities, but also in the availability of information and materials, the role of the
police and security officials, and the credibility and professionalism of the Electoral Commission of
Zambia. Changes to the Electoral Act in 2006 gave the commission greater independence and helped it
to win greater confidence from the voters and the donors who helped to fund its election activities.
9.
Political and legal institutions in Zambia are maturing. However, domestic pressure groups need
to be better organized and more visible to ensure the enactment of policies in the public interest.
Although there are vested interests for and against reform, they often lack voice. This weakness of
domestic lobbies, such as the business community, which might otherwise pressure the state to improve
services or infrastructure, promotes inertia in the system. Civil society has occasionally exercised its
voice very effectively, as in 1991 when it succeeded in transforming the country’s politics from a single
party to multiparty system or in 2001 when it resisted attempts to change the constitution. However, few
opportunities exist for the electorate to hold leaders accountable for policy failures, at least in the years
between elections.
10. A culture that is neither fully based on rules, nor characterized by unbridled rent-seeking, tends to
favor indecision and conservatism rather than radical political or economic departures that could
alienate fragile constituencies and provoke a wider reaction by civil society. As a result, there is limited
domestic opposition to maintaining the status quo—to retaining state control over energy,
telecommunications, and water; to avoiding changes to the land regime; to not pursuing

2

decentralization. Indeed, because reforms in each of these areas potentially provoke more vocal public
reaction or dilute the power of the centralized state, the path of least resistance is to leave the system
unchanged.
11. Notwithstanding some of these constraints, Zambia has a long tradition of peace. There is no
history of successful military coups or violent conflicts, whether domestic or international, which have
plagued many of its neighbors. Furthermore, although ethnically plural, the country has no substantive
experience of ethnic sectionalism or repression. It does not suffer large disparities in land ownership or
a significant presence of a market-dominant minority. Whereas Zambia is endowed with an abundance
of natural and mineral resources, chiefly cobalt and copper ore, it has not suffered the dire political and
social consequences that have afflicted some developing countries with more fungible international
commodities, such as petroleum. Each of these features contributes to Zambia’s stability and
governability, positive attributes lacking in many of its competitors.
B. Social Conditions
12. While Zambia is making progress in several areas, achievement of the Millennium Development
Goals remains a challenge. Zambia will almost certainly meet the targets for attaining universal primary
education and gender parity. However, it is unlikely to achieve targets on maternal mortality, infant
mortality, halving poverty and environmentally sustainable development. The health sector represents
one of the greatest challenges, as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and associated diseases are decimating the
population, generating vast numbers of orphans and vulnerable children, and adversely affecting the
workforce. Life expectancy at birth in Zambia has fallen to about 40 years5, mainly because of the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The human toll of HIV/AIDS for families and communities in Zambia is
startling. Even though levels of infection have stabilized, the prevalence rate is 16 percent among people
age 15–49. About 1 million Zambians (roughly 10 percent of the population) are infected with HIV, of
which over 200,000 are in need of antiretroviral therapy. About 3 percent of boys and 11 percent of girls
age 15–24 are living with HIV6, and 40 percent of infants born to HIV-infected parents are HIV
infected. In addition, malaria continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting
for approximately 45 percent of all hospitalizations and out-patient attendances, 50 percent of such
cases among children under age 5, and up to 20 percent of maternal mortality. To improve the chances
for Zambians to live healthy lives, several initiatives have been incorporated in Zambia’s latest national
development plan (the FNDP) and a number of health indicators are being closely monitored.
13. In the education sector, Zambia implemented a policy in 2003 to provide free access to primary
schooling, which has increased net enrollment for grades 1–7. The net enrollment ratio, which had
deteriorated in 1990–2000, has reversed itself, growing from 63 percent to 89 percent. However, some
districts have not done as well as others. The FNDP acknowledges this issue and is targeting those
districts that still have a net enrollment rate of less than 80 percent (10 out of 72 districts in 2005). In
addition, girls leave schools earlier than boys, and pupil-teacher ratios in several districts are very high
(over 100 in 12 districts in 2005). While progress has been made in improving access to drinking water
sources, rural water supply and sanitation has not faired as well. Sanitation is a huge challenge in both
urban and rural areas, with only 43 percent of the population in urban areas and 13 percent in rural areas
having adequate access. Poor access to water and sanitation undermines progress on many of the

Millennium Development Goals, because it increases water-borne diseases, time spent drawing water,
and environmental pollution. In response, the government has developed and incorporated within the
FNDP the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program to help it meet its Millennium
Development Goals for water and sanitation.
C. Economic Conditions
14. Recent Economic Developments. Zambia has long been a nation with immense untapped potential.
It has large mineral and agricultural resources that have not been fully utilized, with less than 12 million
hectares of arable land under agriculture. More efficient allocation and development of the country’s
rich land and water resources could make significant contributions to economic growth. Due to a
combination of inadequate policies and low international commodity prices, real GDP fell by an average
of 0.2 percent per year between 1991 and 1998, with significant declines in the construction and mining
sectors.
15. With good economic management and several years of strong economic growth, Zambia has
turned around its image as a country performing considerably below its potential. In sharp contrast with
the 1991-1998 period, the country has recorded positive GDP growth for the last nine consecutive years,
led in particular by the mining, construction and services sectors. Growth of agriculture has remained
stagnant, which can be explained in large part by the fact that smallholder agriculture is mostly low
value commodities that are rain fed and therefore fluctuate with periods of drought. GDP has grown at
an annual average rate of about 5 percent since 2000 and growth in 2007 is estimated at 5.7 percent
(Table 1). Macro economic performance, supported in part by the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF), has been positive and inflation has fallen to single digits, its lowest level in three
decades.
16. Increased copper production, high international copper prices and additional debt relief through
the HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) have improved Zambia’s external position
significantly. This has lead to an enormous improvement in the current account balance (including
grants) from a negative 4.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to a positive balance of 3.0 percent in 2006. These
improvements in the external situation have resulted in a much-needed increase in international
reserves, which stand now at 2.5 months of imports. The main source of this improvement is the
exceptional rise in copper prices since 2003 by approximately 300 percent. This has allowed growth of
export proceeds to outperform increases in imports, which also rose sharply during this period triggered,
in part, by rising fuel costs and imports of mining related investment goods. Non-copper exports have
also grown rapidly amounting to a US$880 million for 2006, up by 165 percent compared to its US$
level in 2000. Zambia’s strong export performance in conjunction with extensive external debt relief
and large inflows of private capital, have impacted the exchange rate which appreciated sharply in late
2005. Even though the kwacha subsequently depreciated, its level in real effective terms is 40 percent
above the average level for the period 2003-04.
17. After years of weak fiscal policy implementation, the authorities have improved management of
fiscal resources and reduced their domestic financing needs drastically. The overall fiscal deficit for
2007 declined to 0.2 percent of GDP, driven in part by low capacity in line ministries to execute capital
projects. The budget outlook indicates a modest overall deficit of 1.1 percent for 20087. These
developments have taken the fiscal angle out of inflation. Tight monetary policy, a strong kwacha, and

lower food prices due to a recovery in food production after the drought during the 2004/5 planting
season, have reduced inflation to single digits for the first time in over three decades. For the year
ending December 2007, inflation stood at 8.9 percent. Macro economic improvements have resulted in a
rapid expansion of loans and advances by commercial banks to the private sector. At the end of
September 2007, loans and advances to the private sector equaled 10.4 percent of GDP up from 6
percent at the beginning of 2006, indicating increased intermediation by the commercial banking sector.
However, more needs to be done – the Africa wide average is 18 percent
18. Debt Sustainability. Zambia has benefited from the enhanced HIPC and MDRI initiatives as a
result of which external public debt had declined to less then 10 percent of GDP by the end of 2007.
The Low Income Debt Sustainability Analysis jointly undertaken by the IMF and World Bank states
that Zambia’s risk of external debt distress is low and that total public debt is sustainable under all
scenarios analyzed (Annex 9). Domestic debt developments have also been favorable as government has
reduced its domestic borrowing requirements. The total domestic debt to GDP ratio, including domestic
payment arrears, is estimated at 16.8 percent at the end of 2007, down from over 27 percent at the end
of 2003. This decline has had a significant impact on domestic interest payments, which declined from
a high 2.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to an estimated 1.6 percent of GDP for 2007. The Government’s
2008-10 MTEF foresees a further reduction of domestic interest payments to 1.2 percent of GDP, and a
decline in domestic debt, including payment arrears, to 14.2 percent of GDP by 2010.
19. Medium-Term Prospects. Zambia’s economic prospects are generally favorable provided that
macro economic stability is maintained and progress is made to manage the economic consequences of
its dependence on natural resources. The expected growth rate of approximately 6 percent (Table 2)
over the near term is achievable and does not require a fundamental change of policy direction.
However, accelerating growth further will require addressing structural constraints (Section D),
continued prudent macroeconomic management to address the adverse impact of large resource inflows,
improved ability of the public sector to channel resources to priority programs in a transparent and
accountable manner, and improved competitiveness.

20. Zambia’s external environment will remain challenging because of its dependency on mineral
exports. Short run growth will continue to be dominated by expansion in mining and mining related
sectors while diversification of the economy will be needed to accelerate growth and poverty reduction
over the medium to long term. Increasing productivity of agriculture, coupled with diversification towards
higher value crops, enhanced commercialization among smallholders, and expansion of agro-processing,
while improving connectivity and integration of Zambia’s rural economy will be important to improve
economic opportunities for the rural population, increase their contribution to development, and their
poverty reduction.
D. Poverty and Inequality
21. Despite strong economic performance in recent years, rural poverty has not abated. According to
the Central Statistical Office’s 2006 estimates, 64 percent of the Zambian population, or approximately
7.5 million people, live below the national poverty line.8
22. As illustrated in Figure 1, poverty in Zambia is predominantly a rural phenomenon, affecting 81
percent of rural people, but only 34 percent of urban dwellers. Although Zambia is more urbanized (35
percent) than most African nations, two-thirds of its people are small-scale farmers. Between 1996 and
2006, the country witnessed strong rural-to-rural and urban-to-urban labor movements but much less
pronounced increases in rural-to-urban migration due, in part, to already high levels of urbanization.
Worryingly, rural poverty has remained persistently high, as Zambia’s growth over the past decade has
not provided sufficient economic opportunities for the rural poor. Indeed, the two most urbanized
provinces, the Copperbelt (42 percent urbanization) and Lusaka (29 percent urbanization), are the only

8

This estimate is based on the recently completed Living Conditions Measurement Survey (LCMS), which is an
indicator-monitoring survey. The Bank’s Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment for 2005 (Report No. 32573-ZM) is
based on the LCMS02/03, which was an integrated household budget survey, and thus the results are not
comparable. The 2005 estimate of Zambia’s poverty headcount is 56 percent, while the Central Statistical Office,
using the same survey, estimates Zambia’s poverty headcount at 68 percent. The main difference is that the Bank’s
poverty line is based on the caloric intake recommended by the World Health Organization, while the CSO uses a
caloric intake that is about 10 percent higher.

households. Any strategy to reduce
poverty in Zambia and make growth more inclusive must include a leading role for rural growth and
development, with a substantial focus on smallholder agriculture, tourism development, infrastructure,
and other non-farm employment creation.

II. Zambia’s Development Challenge
23. Accelerating economic growth and ensuring that the majority of Zambia’s population can benefit
from this growth remain Zambia’s central development challenges.
A. Accelerating Growth
24. Zambia needs to grow faster than its current rate of 6 percent per year in order to achieve its
Millennium Development Goals and the national vision of becoming a middle-income economy by
2030. In addition, the growth needs to be diversified, as Zambia’s continued dependence on copper
creates risks and is unlikely to generate the jobs and income levels needed to achieve its goals.
Accelerating and sustaining faster growth will depend on Zambia’s ability to become more competitive,
both regionally and globally. Zambia ranks 117th out of 128 countries included in the 2007 Global
Competitiveness Index, reflecting a challenging business environment where it is more costly to start
and grow a business than it is in many other countries.
25. Three clusters of constraints are particularly binding for businesses: physical infrastructure,
human resources, and institutional capacity. The poor quality and high cost of transport,
communications, and power make it extremely difficult for Zambian enterprises to compete. In addition,
the low levels of health, education, and entrepreneurial skills prevent most citizens from taking
advantage of the economic liberalization and improved investment opportunities. Finally, Zambia’s
public administration and legal and regulatory system, including the enabling environment for business,
needs improvement, as evidenced by its 2008 “Doing Business” ranking of 116 out of the 178 countries
included.
26. The Regional Dimension. The high cost of transport, communications and power in Zambia is
closely linked to the country being land-locked, surrounded by eight neighboring countries (Tanzania,
Malawi, Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe).

7

As such, Zambia’s development opportunities are intrinsically linked to the interests and conditions of
its neighbors, particularly regarding transport corridors, power pools, water resources management,
agricultural markets, and management of transmittable diseases. Zambia is a member of the Southern
Africa Power Pool, which allows it to pool risks and trade power with member countries in Southern
Africa. Zambia is also a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)9 and
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which provide forums for Zambia to
coordinate regional integration policies and trade with those of its surrounding countries. Regional trade
has become increasingly important for Zambia and the share of SADC and COMESA has increased
from 4 and 4 percent to 36 and 15 percent between 2002 and 2006. As a result South Africa has
emerged as a dominant trading partner receiving 27 percent of Zambia's exports and supplying 70
percent of its imports. Zambia is on target to meet its obligations under the SADC free trade area, the
COMESA free trade area and in its efforts to implement a common external tariff as part of the
COMESA customs union which aims to come into effect at the end of this year. To deepen integration
and maximize benefits further, Zambia will need to pursue harmonization of policies under its regional
trade commitments. Specifically, it will need to press for improving trade facilitation, simplifying rules
of origin, undertaking multi-country projects in the areas of transportation and energy, and ensuring
parallel most favored nation tariff liberalization.
27. An important challenge, if Zambia is to sustain high rates of growth, is to ensure that growth is
environmentally compliant, especially since the mining industry makes a major contribution to growth.
Investors in this sector may have paid insufficient attention to environmental issues: One indication is
the recent collapse of bridges as a result of the release of mining sediments into the riverbed. The
tourism industry, another growth sector with significant employment potential, depends on wellmanaged biodiversity. However, most of the 19 national parks and 34 game management areas are
degraded. With Zambia’s deforestation rate one of the highest in the world, there is the risk that its
forests might disappear in a few years. If tourism is to be sustained beyond the Victoria Falls area, and if
the country’s natural assets are to continue to render their valuable ecosystem services, the government
faces a challenge to significantly improve policies and budgets for resource management.
B. Sharing Growth
28. Despite efforts to ensure macroeconomic stability and diversify the economy, rural areas have
suffered from years of development neglect. Underlying the slow pace of development is a chronic lack
of investment in public infrastructure and services—both hard (roads, energy, information and
communication technologies) and soft (skills, health, markets)—and the poor investment climate,
resulting from the slow pace of implementing much needed structural reforms.10 The 2003 Investment
Climate Assessment, a survey of Zambian businesses, found that the most costly problems encountered
by firms were: (a) cost and access to finance, (b) macroeconomic uncertainty, (c) taxes, (d) uncertainty
regulatory policy, (e) crime, (f) corruption, and (g) poor infrastructure. These priorities were confirmed
by the 2006 World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey, and while the 2008 Investment
Climate Assessment (forthcoming June 2008) is expected to report progress in some areas such as
improved macroeconomic stability, substantial improvements are needed across these priority areas in
order to facilitate diversification, and enable shared growth and increased equality between urban and
rural areas.

30. Although the situation has improved slowly over the years, about 65 percent of the population has
no access to finance; more than 50 percent of rural households still live more than 5 kilometers from the
nearest health facility; only 8 percent are within 5 kilometers of a secondary school; and about half of
the rural households have to travel more than 25 kilometers to reach an input market. Just 2 percent of
rural households have access to electricity, compared with 40 percent in urban areas, and only 13
percent of rural households have access to sanitation services, compared to 41 percent in urban areas
(Table 3). An extension of the rural road network and other public utilities in rural areas is a necessary
complement to all other investments and reforms to foster shared growth in Zambia. However, these
interventions need to be managed carefully and positioned strategically to maximize the economies
growth potential.11
C. Improving Competitiveness
31. Improving Zambia’s competitiveness will require that all sectors of the economy become
substantially more productive. In a recent sample of 15 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
Zambia ranked lowest of all in total factor productivity (Figure 2).12The efficiency with which Zambian
firms use direct inputs, such as labor and capital, to produce goods is low relative to other countries, and
it drops dramatically when indirect costs, such as infrastructure, security, and dealing with red tape, are
factored in. Indirect costs in Zambia account for about 22 percent of average gross value added twice
the share of labor costs, which imposes a competitiveness penalty on existing firms and deters
investment and entry of new firms.
32. Productivity problems are particularly acute in the agriculture sector, where poverty in
concentrated. Most agricultural producers are asset-poor smallholders, who use simple technologies and
cultivation practices to produce rain-fed maize, groundnuts, roots, and tubers, mostly for their own

consumption. Productivity levels are well below potential on account of (a) the poor access of most
smallholders to commercially useful knowledge, inputs, and markets; (b) the lack of public
infrastructure, especially roads, which hampers private sector provision of goods and services; (c)
misdirection of public resources into poorly targeted subsidies and under provisioning of public goods
and services, such as extension and research; and (d) weak capacity to manage risks, particularly those
resulting from insecure land tenure and climate change. Low productivity and low return to labor and
land lead to chronically low farm income for smallholders.
33. The government’s strategy for improving the productivity of smallholder agriculture needs to be
more effective. A variety of measures can be taken to improve economic opportunities for rural people,
increase their contribution to development, and reduce their poverty. For example, more resources from
the agriculture budget (excluding donor funds) could be released for productivity-enhancing
investments if fertilizer and maize subsidies could be reduced through better targeting. The government
could also encourage greater diversification into higher-value crops, enhanced commercialization
among smallholders, and more access and delivery options between farms and agro-processors, while
improving the connectivity and integration of Zambia’s rural economy. Improving the condition of the
road network and extending the network to remote areas are keys to boosting agricultural productivity in
many ways: by improving smallholders’ access to better inputs and extension services, by increasing
capacity utilization at agro-processing facilities, and by providing more marketing opportunities for
rural producers.
34. The traditional land tenure system in Zambia also limits options for small-scale farmers as the
majority of land is held under customary land arrangements with limited transfer possibilities. While
individuals can use land and pass it on to family members through inheritance, no exclusive rights can
be claimed by individual users, nor can they sell or mortgage the land. Only 6–15 percent of total land
allows for ownership rights and registration under the so-called statutory tenure. The system governing
rights over this land is administered by the state under English statutory law and distributed in 99-year

10

leases. Despite the dominance of customary landholding, access to land is not considered a binding
constraint, as land is abundant in Zambia and most smallholders asking for more land from their village
chief do get it. However, not only does the lack of title limit access to capital from the financial system
for housing and farm development, but could also be an obstacle to expansion of small firms into
commercial agriculture and the formation of more efficient farms that realize economies of scale. The
Bank has engaged Government and the Land Alliance, an NGO group, in a dialogue on land-related
issues over the past several years and has provided inputs into the preparation of a national land policy,
which is now being discussed by various stakeholders after which it will be presented to Cabinet for
approval.
35. Adapting to climate change is another challenge that hits agriculture disproportionately.
According to the World Resources Institute, Zambia’s per capita greenhouse emissions place it 11th in
the world in 2000, when land use change is factored in. Already the country is suffering unusual rainfall
patterns at much cost to its agricultural production and infrastructure and to the health of its citizens.
The government has recently announced the creation of a Secretariat for Climate Change that will help
develop a climate adaptation strategy, especially in key sectors like agriculture, with crops better
adapted to climate variability, and infrastructure, with standards that can sustain natural disasters.
D. Addressing Structural Constraints
36. Because Zambia needs to address numerous structural constraints, it is useful to cluster and
prioritize them. This country assistance strategy adopts the broad approach taken by the Africa
Competitiveness Report 2007, which suggests that countries at Zambia’s stage of development compete
based on factor endowments—primarily unskilled labor and natural resources—and to increase
competitiveness must alleviate constraints in four key areas: macroeconomic and expenditure
management, institution building, infrastructure development, and human resources.
37. Macroeconomic and expenditure management. Zambia’s economic prospects are generally
favorable (Para 19), provided that macroeconomic stability is maintained and progress is made to
manage the economic consequences of its natural resource dependency. It is important to build on recent
macroeconomic achievements and the impulse this has given to economic growth and poverty
reduction. Zambia will continue to face a challenging external environment, largely because of its
dependence on mineral exports. One of these challenges is the well-known phenomenon of Dutch
Disease, which often takes place during commodity price booms when a country's currency tends to
appreciate. That appreciation puts pressure on competitiveness of the non-commodity sector and thus
hampers diversification. Zambia’s macroeconomic framework, therefore, needs to be designed to
prevent a significant real appreciation of the kwacha (Box 1).
38. This will mean that the government needs to expand the role of fiscal policy to limit demand for
non-tradables, while improving the efficiency of the domestic service sector as much as possible,
especially for health and education services. Increased revenues from the copper sector, as a result of the
new mining sector fiscal regime will need to be managed prudently not only to avoid macroeconomic
challenges but to also support the objectives of diversification and increased investment in infrastructure
to improve productivity and competitiveness (Para 101). To reverse past shortcomings, expenditures
need to be increased in support of rural development and programs that benefit rural areas.
39. Improved macroeconomic performance has helped to stabilize the financial sector, but the level of
financial intermediation remains weak, characterized by low levels of competition, poor coverage and
breadth of services, and high costs. Interest rates and interest rate spreads have declined, yet the benefit
has accrued to large firms disproportionately. Access to finance remains limited, despite a renewed
interest in retail banking and experimentation with rudimentary bank branch infrastructure in urban and

Box 1: Zambia - Harnessing the Copper Boom
The recently announced changes to the fiscal regime for mining (increase in mineral royalty from 0.6
percent to 3 percent; corporate tax pegged at 30 percent; and the introduction of a windfall tax) will increase
tax revenues from copper by an estimated US$415 million annually. While providing an opportunity, the
increase in revenues will also challenge Zambia’s ability to manage the boom effectively and underscore the
need to evaluate these challenges and propose actions to address them. These challenges include:
Dutch Disease. The phenomena that a boom in revenues coming from natural resources, such as copper,
leads to a shrinking tradable sector, excluding mining. Key issues to analyze include the exchange rate and
its impact on nontraditional exports, as well as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on exchange rate
management.
Volatility of Fiscal and Export Revenues. Commodity prices go through pronounced cycles of booms and
bust and therefore revenues require careful management to ensure a steady flow to the budget and a
sustainable external account. The key issues here are the design and management of funds in which
revenues can be deposited when commodity prices are high and withdrawn when prices are low.
Transparency and Accountability. In many countries, the natural resource sector has been vulnerable to
corruption and misuse of resources. While it is imperative to establish a formal financial accountability
process, such a top-down process should be complimented by bottom-up accountability mechanisms (such
as expenditure tracking surveys) and full transparency of resources transferred between the government and
mining industry (such as through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) and enforcement of the
country’s environmental protection laws.
Spending Increased Revenues Wisely. It is often difficult for governments to direct the additional
resources to projects that generate the highest impact. The government should develop capacity to allow it
to scrutinize expenditure programs, using tools such as cost-benefit analysis to prioritize and rank
expenditure programs. Government should also ensure that resources allocated go through a well
functioning financial management and procurement process.

peri-urban areas. However, these embryonic efforts have yet to translate into a meaningful increase in
access and usage of diversified financial services, such as microfinance, leasing, and mortgages.

In the agriculture sector, the dominant form of smallholder credit is the financing
arranged by out-grower companies. Smallholder farmers are generally not able to meet the
rigorous credit appraisal procedures and tangible security requirements of commercial banks, in part
40.

because they do not have land title. Therefore smallholder farmers do not have access to bank finance.
Given the strong correlation between productivity and access to improved financial services, it is
essential that weaknesses in the land tenure system (Para 34) and in the financial sector are addressed.
Fortunately, Zambia is midway through the implementation of a two-phase comprehensive Financial
Sector Development Plan covering the period 2004–09. Phase I, which largely focused on legal and
regulatory reforms, has been completed, and the central bank has started the process of preparing the
implementation plan for Phase II. It is expected that Phase II activities will focus on longer-term issues,
including the national pension system, insurance, and long-term finance.
41. Institution Building. Institutions of policymaking and regulation need strengthening in Zambia.
Although the country has a formal rules structure—including laws, courts, and enforcement
institutions—these can be circumvented. Institutions intended to carry out oversight functions, such as
the Anti-Corruption Commission, need to develop greater autonomy. Implementation capacity has been
identified by Government as a significant constraint, especially in institutions mandated with
responsibility for service delivery, and a culture of accountability to the public needs to be developed.

12

Civil society institutions that should be the voice of the poor in rural areas have generally not been able
to influence policy and implementation decisions. As a result, the quality and timeliness of services is
low, especially in rural areas, where the cost of provision is relatively higher than it is in urban areas.
Weak institutions result in a high-cost business environment, which erodes productivity and
competitiveness—especially for smaller firms.
42. Creating credible, respected, and technically competent institutions both inside and outside of
government could provide a real opportunity for improving public decision making and accountability.
Such institutions could also help temper the ideologically polarized (and not always well-informed)
edge that often characterizes policy discourse in Zambia. Building these coalitions of change would also
support the national development plan’s stated priority to improve governance and accountability
through institutionalizing political, administrative, financial and budgetary transparency and
accountability in all priority sectors and programs. Such institutions (government agencies at the central
and local level, as well as statutory bodies) could increase accountability in service delivery, improve
the investment climate, and support rural competitiveness.
43. Infrastructure Development. Zambia urgently needs to strengthen the quality of its
infrastructure: better access to markets and services, greater reliability, and lower costs would
dramatically increase connectivity, and raise productivity and competitiveness, particularly in rural
areas. The current performance of transport, energy, and telecommunication sectors make it difficult for
Zambian enterprises to compete with those in neighboring countries. Infrastructure development is also
hindered by excessive transportation and communication costs and limited local contracting capacity.
For example, transport costs are five times higher than those in industrial country markets, and even
within the region, the cost of exporting a container from Zambia is 25 percent higher than from Malawi,
another land locked country. Similarly, if Zambian firms enjoyed the same access to
telecommunications services that South African firms have, productivity would increase by 13
percent.13 “Normalizing” aviation policies and fuel prices to the levels of South Africa would improve
the competitiveness of Zambian beef exporters by 9 percent. In addition to national programs, regional
solutions will be essential to achieving targets in infrastructure development, especially water resources
management, roads and energy.
44. In telecommunications, Zambia initially made faster progress than other countries in the region,
but the momentum has declined and it now lags behind other countries in telecommunications reform in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Limited access to telecommunications services and high prices are undermining
trade, competitiveness, and economic growth, as well as the use of information and communication for
poverty alleviation and social inclusion14. Lack of infrastructure and high prices are also constraining
the development of government applications using information and communication technologies (egovernment), which could be powerful tools to promote good governance, transparency, and
accountability in service delivery.
45. Financial as well as physical infrastructure is lacking. While the banking sector increased its total
branch network by 11 percent to 181 from 162 in 2006, the recent improvements in physical financial
infrastructure are yet to translate into meaningful increases in usage of financial services, particularly
for rural entrepreneurs and households. With only an estimated 110,000 savings accounts for the entire

population, access to formal financial services is limited. Although the legal and regulatory framework
generally supports access to finance, weaknesses persist, especially those relating to contract
enforcement.
46. To date, reforms intended to bridge the “infrastructure gap” have not succeeded, and the poor
quality of infrastructure continues to drag down productivity levels.15 According to the FNDP, funding
for infrastructure has been “erratic, inadequate, and uncoordinated.” It is generally accepted that
performance in these sectors is hampered by the plethora of agencies with overlapping roles and
responsibilities, the inefficiency of operations, the lack of cost recovery, and the inadequate
commitment of government to meet its financial obligations to these agencies.
47. While these weaknesses affect the entire country, the rural areas are affected in more direct ways.
First, improvements in the policy environment and institutional arrangements for infrastructure services
have not improved access of most rural people to such basic services as electricity, sanitation, clean
water, health care, and education. Access is hampered by huge spatial distances with no proper road
networks and exacerbated by the lack of an adequate transport system. Even in places where facilities
may be available, the levels of service are low because of a lack of trained staff, requisite tools,
equipment, and other provisions. Second, although it is well recognized that Zambia suffers from
cyclical droughts and floods, there is insufficient infrastructure development to prevent or mitigate their
impact on rural households. The vulnerability of rural households to the negative effects of climatic
conditions limits resilience to the potential impact of climate change.
48. What can be done to assist the government in improving infrastructure policy, the institutional and
regulatory framework, and its spending priorities? Ongoing public expenditure reviews are part of the
answer. Another important part is to leverage resources by mobilizing private capital for infrastructure
development, especially in energy, transport, telecommunications, and water infrastructure. Mobilizing
private investment, however, requires improving the business environment, reducing transactional and
regulatory costs, and encouraging competition.
49. Human Resources. Zambia's Human Development Index has declined from 0.470 in 1975 to
0.434 in 2007, and it currently ranks 165th out of 177 countries.16 The low ranking is predominantly
due to Zambia's record-low life expectancy at birth.17 Zambia's high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, along
with malaria and other infectious diseases, is the chief cause of this high mortality rate. Malaria is most
severe in poor and rural areas, reducing GDP by 1.5 percent annually.18 Malnutrition is also severe, with
47 percent of Zambia's children found as being stunted, 28 percent underweight and 5 percent wasted.19
Although still relatively high, child mortality rates in the country have shown signs of decline. Mortality
of children under age 5 was 191 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1992 and declined markedly to 168

15

Numerous policy initiatives are aimed at bridging the infrastructure gap, including the constitution of the National
Council for Construction; the Transport Policy of 2002, which instituted the Road Development Agency; the
amendments to the Electricity Act; the formation of the Energy Regulation Board and the Rural Electrification
Authority; and the establishment of commercial water utilities in the urban areas.

years for life expectancy at birth, compared to UN estimates of 40 years.

deaths in 2002. The maternal mortality ratio has been rising - from 649 in 1996 to the current estimate
of 720 per 100,000 live births20 - despite high antenatal first attendance rates and a reasonably high
contraceptive acceptance rate. Maternal mortality targets are unlikely to be attained unless there are
concerted efforts to invest more in improving human resources in the health sector, thereby improving
services for essential and emergency obstetric care.
50. The impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Zambia is a serious threat to the development agenda.
With 16 percent of the adult population infected with HIV, Zambia faces its most critical health,
development and humanitarian challenge to date. The epidemic has now reached a mature stage, and its
effect is felt in all social and economic areas in the country, with global research suggesting that
HIV/AIDS is threatening to derail the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, not only for
public health but also for poverty alleviation and education.21 Furthermore, the so-called feminization of
the AIDS epidemic is also evident in Zambia, as more women than men have become infected, caused
to a large degree by gender discrimination, social restrictions, gender-based violence, as well as
women's lack of access to education, employment and decision-making power. Zambia’s neighboring
countries also have high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates (Southern Africa has the highest in the world),
pointing to a need for a regional solution to address the problem of infectious diseases, as the
transmission of these diseases transgresses national borders.

Achievement of universal primary education in Zambia is on track. In 2002, the
government lifted user fees for schooling. Significant gains have been made in the school
enrollment ratio, particularly at basic education levels, and recently have reached 119 percent
(2005). Challenges remain, however, including improving conditions for teaching staff and the
quality of education and services, especially in rural schools. Learning outcomes at basic levels
are still low and not are improving. There is a gap of approximately 20 percentage points in
school enrollment for children from the poorest 20 percent of households, compared with those
from the wealthiest 20 percent. Secondary enrollment rates in Zambia, at 24 percent, are lower
than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa and much lower than the average for low-income
countries.

51.

52. Although Zambia has made major strides in achieving gender equality in enrolment ratios, other
gender targets remain a challenge. In particular, the reversal of the high female illiteracy rate requires a
concerted effort. A significant gender gap also remains in drop-out rates in secondary education.
Women’s participation in decision making, however, has been increasing steadily from 10 percent in
1997 to 18 percent in 2003, although still falling short of the South African Development Community’s
target of 30 percent. Female members of parliament currently make up 12 percent of the total
membership.
E. The Challenge of Improving Governance
53. The 2005 Afro Barometer Survey ranks Zambia almost precisely at the midpoint of over 100 lowand middle-income countries in the quality of its checks and balances and bureaucratic institutions.
Although the quality of public administration is generally better than the average for sub-Saharan
Africa, developing institutional capacity remains a priority (Para 41) and corruption continues to

15

undermine development effectiveness. The business environment for the private sector can be improved,
notably in the day-to-day burden imposed by the bureaucracy on enterprise managers and in the
unreliability of the electricity infrastructure.
54. The same 2005 Afro Barometer Survey reports a strong norm of openness among Zambia’s
population, with over 80 percent of respondents both committed to multiparty democracy and agreeing
(and 46 percent agreeing “very strongly”) that people should be able to speak their minds about politics,
free of government influence. But, notwithstanding the norm of openness, a survey also found that 72
percent of respondents offered that they were “always” or “often” careful about what they say about
politics—though 58 percent of respondents also reported that freedom to say what they think was better
in 2005 than a few years earlier.22
55. As in many countries, in Zambia there is a substantial gap between the decision-making processes
to arrive at a “good” set of development policies and interventions, on the one hand, and the
implementation processes to put them into effect, on the other. The consequence, as in many developing
countries around the world is that, even with a full array of formal rules structure, laws, courts,
legislature, and enforcement agencies, Zambia’s formal institutions need strengthening. The
consequence of Zambia’s combination of openness and continuing weakness of formal institutions has
been strong deference to the status quo. Reform is unusually difficult when weaknesses in formal
institutions make it difficult to build robust, inclusive coalitions in support of government policy. Farreaching departures from the status quo could alienate fragile constituencies and provoke a wider
reaction by civil society. The least difficult option is to leave the system unchanged.

III. The Government’s Strategy for Inclusive Growth
56. Zambia’s strategy to address these development challenges is articulated in its second Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, known as the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), which covers 2006–
10. The FNDP acknowledges that the linkage between growth and poverty reduction has been weak, as
growth has been narrowly driven by a few sectors. While the FNDP recognizes the importance of
continued contributions of the mining, construction, and energy sectors to overall growth, it advocates a
major shift in emphasis to sectors such as rural development, agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing
that might have greater pro-poor impact through increased employment and income opportunities.
57. The FNDP proposes a multi-pronged strategy for increasing the economic growth rate to
7 percent, sustaining it at this level, and making growth more inclusive. In particular, the
strategy suggests that special emphasis be placed on macroeconomic management, agricultural
and rural development, private and financial sector development, infrastructure, and the social
sectors. In addition, it highlights several cross-cutting issues, such as governance, HIV/AIDS,
environment, gender, and land management.
A. Macroeconomic Policies
58. Notwithstanding the strengthening in macroeconomic performance in recent years, the FNDP
acknowledges that fiscal and monetary policy has, at times, fallen short of achieving its objectives. It
has an elaborate medium-term expenditure framework, under which external cooperating partners are

16

increasingly urged to provide predictable assistance through direct budget support and by moving away
from traditional, individual projects toward a sectorwide approach. According to the FNDP, prudent
spending has allowed a gradual lowering of domestic financing which, together with extensive external
debt relief, have reduced debt service payments and thus provided scope for additional spending to
reduce poverty. Achieving monetary control has, however, proved problematic, mainly owing to
inadequate instruments at the Bank of Zambia to mop up excess liquidity. Lack of coordination of fiscal
and monetary policies has also frequently led to significant volatility in monetary aggregates and further
hampered liquidity management.
59. On fiscal policy, the FNDP appropriately identifies the need to improve budget execution,
strengthen financial accountability and expenditure monitoring, and enhance the revenue base.
Increased revenue is needed to obtain resources for the domestically financed development programs,
and the strategy correctly identifies broadening of the tax base and rationalization of the structure of tax
rates as key principles that should underlie tax reforms. Recently announced changes to the mining tax
regime should result in an annual increase of US$415 million in tax revenues, making the task of budget
execution and macroeconomic management more challenging. On the monetary policy front, the FNDP
acknowledges that excessive monetary growth has been a major contributor to high inflation in Zambia.
The strategy rightly points to the need to strengthen coordination between the Ministry of Finance and
the Bank of Zambia with regard to cash and treasury management and also states that the operational
autonomy of the Bank of Zambia will be reinforced. The overall objective of monetary policy is to
achieve and maintaining single-digit inflation during the period of the plan.
B. Agricultural and Rural Development
60. The FNDP is critical of the low levels of spending in the agriculture sector, which have generally
been less than 5 percent of the government’s budget, or 1 percent of GDP. The FNDP acknowledges
that these low allocations have run down agricultural support infrastructure, left extension services
operating at 40 percent of capacity, and resulted in a high incidence of livestock disease, all contributing
to low agriculture productivity and high incidence of poverty. The FNDP seeks to reverse these trends
by significantly increasing resources allocated to the sector. It seeks to raise agricultural productivity,
especially in the smallholder sector, by strengthening agricultural extension services, encouraging
diversification in the production of staple and cash crops, continuing ongoing land development
programs, and opening up of new farming blocks for commercial development.
C. Private and Financial Sector Development
61. The FNDP assigns a central role to the private sector in accelerating growth and observes that this
will “require an appropriate enabling environment that supports robust private sector development.” The
plan indicates government’s intent to improve the competitiveness of the economy and strengthen the
investment climate through the implementation of the Private Sector Development Program (PSD) and
the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP). The PSD program identifies six ongoing areas of
emphasis, including (a) improvements in the policy environment and institutions that serve the private
sector; (b) regulations and laws; (c) infrastructure development; (d) business facilitation and economic
diversification; (e) trade expansion; and (f) economic empowerment for citizens. The FSDP provides the
framework for the development of a “stable, sound and market-based financial system that supports
economic diversification and sustainable growth.” Specific FSDP activities include the (a)
harmonization of financial sector legislation in the economy, (b) resolution of weaknesses in the
insolvent state-owned financial institutions, and (c) increasing the supply of market knowledge on the
supply and demand of financial services in Zambia.

17

D. Infrastructure
62. The FNDP acknowledges that poor physical infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, irrigation,
and water and sanitation, has held back private sector development in the country. The FNDP targets
increased expenditures on road and rail infrastructure and highlights the urgency of investing in new
hydroelectric power stations and implementing a power rehabilitation program, including rural
electrification. The plan notes, however, that the public purse cannot undertake all the investments
needed and identifies public-private partnerships as an important mechanism to realize these
investments. In this regard, the FNDP advocates the development of a comprehensive roadmap to
provide a favorable policy environment and legal framework for public-private collaboration in
infrastructure.
E. Social Sectors
63. The FNDP correctly realizes
that spending on health and education,
in a country with a high incidence of
malaria and HIV/AIDS and a shortage
of skilled labor, not only can improve
social welfare but also can spur
economic growth. The plan frankly
discusses the challenges in the social
sectors, which are vast.

Student achievement lags behind Quality
many other African countries (Figure
3), and Zambia’s educational system continues to be characterized by high drop-out rates between
primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of schooling. For more than 30 years, little has been invested in
secondary and tertiary education. The FNDP states, for example, that the newest public secondary
school was built in 1970. Since the FNDP places a premium on skills development, issues of internal
efficiency as well as efficient resource allocation at different levels of the educational system remain
major challenges.
65. The FNDP admits that progress in health indicators has been stagnant under the previous poverty
reduction strategy and rightly highlights the current human resources crisis in the health sector. To
improve the availability of essential drugs and medical supplies the plan advocates stronger
collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance and National Planning on
budget planning and procurement. Such collaboration could ensure that essential drugs are kept in stock,
whereas now funds often are not available when needed to guarantee timely procurement. Furthermore,
the lack of consumption data and the fragmentation of the supply chain management result in poor
forecasting and planning. The plan suggests that a logistic management information system and capacity
building at the district level can address these problems.
F. Governance

18

66. The FNDP’s governance priority is to improve and institutionalize political, administrative,
financial, and budgetary transparency and accountability in all priority sectors and programs. The
governance goals listed in the strategy include increasing access to justice; strengthening collaboration
and cooperation among governance institutions; expanding the National Assembly’s oversight role over
the government; enhancing constitutionalism and the rule of law; and institutionalizing anti-corruption
programs in all public institutions by 2010. The Republican Constitution that is currently undergoing
review is expected to be finalized during the plan period, including amendments to put the public sector
pension fund on a sound financial footing and a revision of the budget cycle that would allow voting on
the budget before the start of its fiscal year.
67. The importance of institutions for implementation, monitoring and evaluation are acknowledged
and prioritized in the FNDP. The newly created Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance is charged
with the responsibility of playing a central role in issues relating to institutional reform, especially to
institutionalize the five-year development planning process as the means to better guide budget
preparation and allocation and to effectively and efficiently allocate scarce national resources.

IV. The World Bank Group Program
68. The principal objective of the World Bank Group’s strategy for Zambia over 2008–11 is to help
Zambia meet its objective to accelerate growth and better share its benefits among the population.
Improving competitiveness and productivity lies at the heart of this strategy, which will be put into
operation through a multisectoral program of assistance organized around four overlapping areas: (a)
macroeconomic and expenditure management; (b) infrastructure development; (c) institutional capacity
enhancement; and (d) social sector development. As stated earlier (Para 4), the main focus of the CAS
will be on supporting improved management of fiscal resources, including the potential fiscal windfall
coming from the increase in copper export prices, and investments in infrastructure to improve
connectivity and integration.
69.
While the strategy for 2008–11 is guided by the Bank’s previous experience in Zambia, it also
represents a departure characterized by greater selectivity, prioritization, and focus on results (Annex
1A). Although IDA 15 country allocations are not yet available, an annual lending program in the range
of US$80-100 million is envisaged, with 15-20 percent of the resources going towards direct budget
support. Actual allocations during the CAS period will be determined on an annual basis and will
depend on: (i) Zambia’s performance rating; (ii) the terms of IDA's assistance to the Zambia (credits or
grants); (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) total IDA resources
available in IDA15 and IDA16; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Interventions in the four
areas mentioned above will be prioritized using selectivity filters (Para 85), lessons from past
experience, and the division of labor agreed upon with government and other cooperating partners
(Annex 6). For example, while the Bank will continue to remain actively involved in the provision of
analytical services in the social sectors, government has indicated that it is more likely to rely upon
bilateral donors and grant resources to finance social sector investments in the future, targeting the
Bank’s investment lending for core infrastructure development. How the Bank will engage in Zambia
will also be different, focusing on narrower, more achievable goals but with deeper engagement with
both government and nongovernmental actors.

19

A. Learning from Past Strategies and Impact
70. This CAS takes into account lessons from the implementation of Bank Group’s assistance to
Zambia since the early 1990s. It also draws upon evaluations conducted by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED, since renamed IEG), assessment of analytical and advisory services conducted by
the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), and a completion report for the 2004–07 strategy.
71. On the basis of a Country Assistance Evaluation for 1996–2001, OED concluded that both the
Bank’s assistance strategy and its performance had been unsatisfactory. One reason for this negative
assessment was that the Bank’s financial assistance to Zambia had continued at high levels, despite poor
policy performance and heavy indebtedness. Furthermore, the high levels of adjustment lending in the
presence of an unsustainable debt situation and the delayed response to HIV/AIDS were both regarded
as shortcomings in the Bank’s strategy during this period. OED also concluded that performance during
the 2000–03 CAS period was unsatisfactory because progress in development outcomes fell short of the
“base case” objectives listed in the CAS, and sustainability was unlikely because of the low levels of
client commitment to policy reforms, stretching back to the mid-1990s.23 This review also noted that the
CAS completion report was not prepared in time for the lessons to be incorporated into the fiscal 2004–
07 CAS. OED made a number of recommendations for future programs in Zambia, including: (a)
lending beyond a minimal threshold should be based on achievement of concrete reforms, measured
against agreed performance indicators, and failure to meet targets should result in a significant reduction
in concessionary lending by the International Development Association (IDA); (b) budget support
should be used judiciously and only after a track record of reform implementation; (c) economic policy
advice and dialogue with authorities should continue even in the absence of budget support; (d) project
design and supervision efforts should be strengthened, given the country’s weak institutional capacity;
and (e) options to enhance food security should be explored and supported with the government.
72. Several important lessons emerge from past Bank support to Zambia. CAS progress reports
indicate that Bank strategies have generally been well aligned with Zambia's policies and appropriate to
Zambia’s circumstances.24 The Bank continues to support a number of reforms in macroeconomic
management, private-sector partnerships, human resource development, environmental management,
infrastructure, and public sector management. Many of these initiatives have yielded positive results,
including improved macroeconomic management, a build up in foreign reserves, and the resolution of
the debt issue. However, accelerating and sustaining high rates of economic growth and strengthening
the impact of growth on poverty reduction remain Zambia’s major challenges. The impact of efforts to
support structural reforms—which are now the priority for poverty reduction—has been mixed, largely
because of the government’s weak capacity and questionable commitment to reform. The following
lessons have been incorporated in the new CAS.
73. The Bank’s Role. As part of the new CAS and harmonization processes, the Bank has reassessed
its strategic position in Zambia to determine where it should be active, passive, or disengaged, based on
its strategy, resources, and comparative advantage.
74. Selectivity. The previous CAS made some progress in focusing on and aligning itself to the
country’s longer-term goals as articulated in the country’s poverty reduction strategy. The new CAS
continues this process, is much more selective, and concentrates on areas where the Bank can add value.

The CAS gives priority to very specific interventions in which the beneficiaries are clear, with goals that
unequivocally are supported by the political authorities. Under the new strategy, the Bank will operate
differently, including working more closely in partnership with other cooperating partners and
increasingly with the private sector to leverage scarce IDA resources.
75. Stakeholder Incentives to Get Results. Strong government commitment is critical for
implementing the reform agenda. The slow progress in implementing structural reforms (energy sector,
land tenure, labor regulations, etc) indicates either insufficient political buy-in or lack of institutional
capacity and incentives to provide adequate follow through. The Bank has undertaken a separate
analysis that illuminates issues related to the political economy of reform, and this work has informed
the preparation of the CAS25. The analysis concludes that the World Bank’s engagement in Zambia has
been characterized by repeated attempts to promote far-reaching reforms, derived from first-best
principles. It recommends that this CAS focus its engagement more narrowly and allow sufficient time
for local coalitions for change to develop before launching new initiatives. Accordingly, proposed
analytical work will explore a variety of reform options that are feasible given Zambia’s political
economy and governance realities. In doing so, the Bank will give heightened attention to engaging civil
society in both analytical work and in project preparation and supervision.
76. Consultations and Dissemination. As recommended in the Quality Assurance Group review,26
the effectiveness of analytical and advisory activities will be increased by greater consultations at the
design stage, more local participation in analysis, and better prioritization and sequencing of
recommendations. Early in the process, all analytical work will identify whether the analysis is being
done for the external (client) or internal (Bank/donor) market, with processing being structured
accordingly. Client-based work will incorporate a means of assessing “demand” and ensuring that the
work is wanted and the client is engaged and actively contributing to the design, analysis, and
dissemination. Overall, the CAS places more emphasis on demand-driven studies that are likely to have
an impact on both policy formulation and the lending program. Historically, insufficient effort and
resources have been devoted to dissemination, which will be scaled up substantially. Greater flexibility
in the allocation of resources will help the Bank respond quickly to emerging issues. CAS
implementation will, to the fullest feasible extent, emphasize transparency and participation by
stakeholders, as a way of helping sustain support from civil society and the private sector, as well as
government.
77. Simplification. Simplifying the design of Bank projects and ensuring the use of appropriate
lending instruments remain priorities, especially in light of weak local capacity. Excessively complex
projects result in poor performance and delays in implementation, as evidenced by the numerous
requests for extensions in the closing date. Project complexity has also contributed to an excessive
dependence on the use of consultants and special project implementation units to implement
development programs. Simpler project design based on existing implementation capacity will help
build government capacity—though the ability to do so depends, to a large extent, on successful public
sector reform resulting in an appropriate incentive system.

78. Results. The results framework for the new CAS (Annex 1A) focuses on a few core set of
monitorable indicators, which are measurable and take into account local data limitations. The results
framework establishes a clear link between Bank-supported activities and the FNDP. A monitoring and
evaluation plan accompanies the results framework (Annex 1B), with consistent sources of data
identified. The baseline utilizes government data, where available, to focus on identical goals and avoid
duplication of effort.
79. An Integrated Strategy. The CAS reflects an integrated strategy for the World Bank Group, as
opposed to IDA alone, thereby leading to improved synergies and sequencing. By establishing a joint
strategy among all its affiliates, the World Bank Group will be better able to draw on respective
expertise in ways that are complementary and more likely to generate the desired outcome.
B. Progress Toward Implementation
80. The Bank has an active portfolio of ten projects in Zambia, with a total commitment of US$325
million, most of which are specific investment operations. The total undisbursed balance amounts to
about US$190 million. Bank projects have a mixed record of implementation in Zambia, reflecting both
weak implementation capacity and insufficient drive to achieving project development objectives. Ten
projects with total net commitments of over US$400 million closed over the fiscal 2004–07 CAS period,
most during 2005.27 Eight projects were extended, some of them up to a period of four years (ERIPTA
and BESSIP), resulting in average implementation periods that are above the Bank-wide and Africa
regional averages.
81. The 2004–07 CAS envisaged the following lending scenarios: (a) a “low case” scenario of
US$180–240 million over the four-year period (or US$45–50 million per year) for one or two
operations aimed at supporting pro-poor interventions and building on implementation success; (b) a
“base case” scenario of US$280–320 million (or US$70–90 million per year); and (c) a “high case” of
US$360–420 million (or US$90–105 million per year). A lending program of US$255 million was
actually delivered, below the expected base case. Although Zambia was eligible for base case lending
upon reaching the HIPC completion point in April 2005, IDA 14 (fiscal 2006) allocations were no
longer being determined by CAS scenarios. A number of projects were cancelled, while others were
added during the course of the CAS as government priorities changed. For example, while the GDLN
Project and the education and health sector SWAPs were cancelled, the Malaria Booster Program and
the Essential Bridges Rehabilitation Program was added to the Zambia program. Overall, total net
commitments declined over the CAS period from US$605 million in fiscal 2004 to about US$324
million in fiscal 2007.
82. In assessing the 1999–2003 CAS completion report, OED recommended (a) strengthening project
design and supervision efforts because of Zambia’s weak institutional capacity; (b) a judicious use of
adjustment lending; and (c) not to lend beyond a minimal program unless measurable and concrete
reforms were undertaken. Furthermore, OED observed that there was a low level of satisfactory
outcomes, because of low borrower ownership, insufficient counterpart funds, and poor project
management. To some extent, these issues were addressed during the 2004–07 CAS. There were
continuing signs of low borrower ownership in some instances, while counterpart funds were slow to
come in a few cases, but this was partially offset with funding from other donors (e.g., in the roads

the previous CAS).

sector) and also through 100 percent IDA financing of some projects. In other cases, project
management remained an issue requiring attention.
83. At the end of fiscal 2005, six projects were deemed to be at risk, representing 50 percent of the
Bank’s portfolio in Zambia. Projects were at risk mainly on account of issues relating to project
management and safeguards, procurement, counterpart funding, monitoring and evaluation, legal
covenants, and issues related to safeguards. Consequently, the Quality Assurance Group placed Zambia
on a Portfolio Improvement Plan for fiscal 2006 to address the deterioration in portfolio performance.
Action plans for each project at risk were implemented and the plans were supervised intensively. The
action plans and close supervision have yielded results: there is presently only one project at risk in the
portfolio, which has been restructured.
C. The Focus and Comparative Advantage of the World Bank Group
84. The overarching objective of the World Bank Group’s program in Zambia over the fiscal 2008–11
period (Annex 3) will be to help the government achieve its objective of accelerating and sharing growth
through highly selective and targeted interventions that maximize the impact of government’s own
resources and programs. The Bank’s comparative advantage lies in its ability to bring international best
practice experience to bear in its policy dialogue through analytical and advisory services and to use its
convening power to leverage scarce IDA resources so that Zambia is able to benefit from competitive
financing and innovative lending products.
85. In implementing its strategy, the Bank will use a set of strategic filters, summarized in Figure 4, and
will choose the most appropriate combination of instruments to achieve the desired development result. In
particular, each Bank intervention will have to satisfy the following criteria:

23

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Is it aligned to the goals set in the FNDP?
Is it in harmony with the principles and the division on labor established by the cooperating
partners under the framework of the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia?
Will it have an impact by contributing to the CAS objective of accelerating and sharing growth?
Is there sufficient government ownership and commitment for the intervention?
Is there an enabling policy environment that will allow the intervention to meet its development
objectives or does the intervention help in the creation of such an environment?
Is there sufficient local capacity to successfully implement the proposed intervention or can such
capacity be created?
Does it leverage additional resources from Cooperating Partners?
Is the governance environment suitable for the intervention or does the initiative expose the Bank
to significant reputational risk?

Interventions that satisfy the strategic filters will be required to develop a results framework (discussed
below) and a monitoring and evaluation system that can determine the Bank’s role and contribution in
helping Zambia meet its development objectives.
86. Macroeconomic and Expenditure Management. A core objective of the Bank’s macroeconomic
program over the CAS period will be to help Zambia better manage its financial resources, so that fiscal
policy can support the inclusive growth agenda (Table 4). The EITI ++ initiative will help Government
manage the macroeconomic consequences of the expected additional inflows from copper and improve
top-down and bottom-up accountability and transparency. The Public Expenditure Review and a series of
Expenditure tracking Surveys will help strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of expenditure
programs; investigate how sectoral expenditure policies can contribute to growth and poverty reduction;
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of large parastatals, such as ZESCO in the energy sector, the
Food Reserve Agency in the agriculture sector, and ZAWA in the tourism sector; and address capacity
issues so that government is better able to prioritize investments. The proposed public expenditure work
will draw heavily on already completed sectoral public expenditure reviews, such as the ones completed
for health and education and the one initiated for agriculture. An impact assessment of the Fertilizer
Support Program (FSP) will be undertaken using Public Expenditure Tracking Survey methodology,
including the provision of technical assistance to identify possible alternatives to the FSP. Reforms in
these areas will be supported through an annual program of Poverty Reduction Support Credits, which
will reinforce the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) jointly agreed between Government and
the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) cooperating partners. The set of 33 PAF indicators, which
are a subset of the FNDP monitoring and evaluation framework, span core priority sectors and have
provided a good basis for the budget support the Bank has provided in recent years and for assessing
FNDP-related performance.
87. Although Zambia’s external debt situation has become sustainable following the debt relief
initiatives, an integral part of helping the government manage its resources better will be the ongoing
support that is being provided to help Zambia develop a debt strategy and strengthen debt management.
That effort will be facilitated by the joint IMF–World Bank annual low-income country debt
sustainability analysis.

88. Infrastructure Development. The Bank’s partnership with the government in the area of
infrastructure will focus largely on energy, transport, and water, so that the economy’s production
potential in agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining sectors can be fully exploited and rural
communities can become better connected and integrated into the national economy (Table 5).
Integration with neighboring countries to develop regional solutions will be emphasized to maximize
efficiency and effectiveness.
89. Energy. In the energy sector, the Bank aims to assist the government in addressing three priorities:
(a) financing new generation and transmission capacity and demand-side management measures to
mitigate the current power crisis; (b) provision of financing and technical assistance for access expansion
to increase the current low electrification rate; and (c) provision of investment and technical assistance to
ZESCO to improve efficiency and quality of services. Passage of the national energy policy by the
Cabinet provides a basis for shaping the dialogue with the government on the key constraining issues, and
how the Bank can be of assistance in promoting efficient development of the sector over the medium to
long term. Technical assistance to the Energy Regulatory Board will help to develop a cost-recovery tariff
framework and also to monitor ZESCO performance benchmarks. In addition, ZESCO will be assisted in
developing a plan to improve efficiency through such measures as reduction of staffing costs, feasibility
studies for loss reductions, and improvement of reliability. An ongoing ESMAP study is providing
technical assistance to Zambian micro and small enterprises and the government to increase the role of
such enterprises in rural energy supply, particularly off-grid supply chains.
90. The proposed lending program in the energy sector, especially the Energy Efficiency and Access
Project and the Hydro Energy Generation Project, will include initiatives to develop and support
implementation of a commercially oriented and sustainable framework for increasing efficiency of the
electricity sector; supporting reinforcement of ZESCO’s existing distribution networks in selected areas to
reduce losses and improve quality of supply; and supporting the government’s efforts to increase
generation through a combination of instruments, including IDA financing as contribution to government
equity in power plants being built through public-private partnerships, exploring the use of IBRD enclave
financing (e.g., for the energy generation in Kafue Gorge Lower, for which IFC is the transaction
advisor), and the provision of partial risk guarantees to enhance credit terms for the commercial debt that
might be raised by ZESCO. Under the Southern Africa Power Market Program, IDA will make a
contribution to Zambia for the Zambia-Tanzania Power Transmission Interconnection and further
strengthening the interconnection with the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Southern Africa Power

Pool. This is necessary to enable Zambia to increase its current role and to maximize benefits from
participation in the electricity trade in the Southern and Eastern Africa Power Pools.
91. Telecommunications. In telecommunications, the Bank will engage the government in policy
dialogue and technical assistance to (a) help establish an agenda for incremental progress in
telecommunications sector reform that is consistent with local political economy realities, (b) help build a
coalition of stakeholders to support this agenda, and (c) assist the government in the implementation of
this agenda. This would prepare the ground for Zambia’s potential participation in the Regional
Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP) in the later years of the CAS cycle. RCIP is a regional
project structured as an APL, for which Zambia is eligible. The objectives of RCIP are to help lower
prices for international capacity, extend the geographic reach of broadband networks, and improve
efficiency and transparency through e-government applications. The first phase of this project has been
approved by the Bank’s Board in fiscal 2007 (including Kenya, Burundi, and Madagascar), and the
second and subsequent phases are likely to include Rwanda and Malawi (in fiscal 2008) and Mozambique
and Tanzania (in fiscal 2009). Given that not all policy conditions are in place for Zambia’s immediate
participation, Zambian participation could occur in fiscal 2010.
92.
Transport. The Bank will review the national transport policy as part of the Road Rehabilitation
and Maintenance Project (RRMP) Phase II and will look at access and mobility issues to better integrate
and align transport sector priorities to the national poverty reduction strategy. Additional financing for
RRMP will continue into the new CAS and focus on (a) reinstating and reconstructing bridges in selected
provinces to integrate communities into the mainstream economy and (b) boost tourism development by
providing access to currently inaccessible areas in selected national parks, which could include the Kafue
National Park, the Lower Zambezi National Park, and the Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park in Livingstone.
93.
Transport costs in Zambia are among the highest in the region, and it is estimated that transport
costs account for about 60 percent of the cost of goods. Because transport costs constrain Zambia’s
regional and global competitiveness and economic growth potential, a study will be carried out to
determine the cost drivers in the transport logistics chain. The study will also look at the market structure

26

and isolate any structural elements that limit competitiveness of the transport sector. The outcome of the
study will be to help identify and evaluate short-, medium-, and long-term policies and strategies,
including specific roles to be played by the government and the cooperating partners to relieve critical
transport infrastructure and logistics bottlenecks that contribute to the high cost of transport. The transport
cost study will be carried out under the regional Nacala Development Corridor Project in collaboration
with Malawi and Mozambique. Improving Zambia’s connectivity to regional markets is critical to provide
increased opportunities for Zambia’s regional exports, which have shown encouraging growth in recent
years (Para 26). Technical advisory services for regional transport, energy, and mining initiatives can be
provided through the Eastern and Southern Africa Technical Advisory Services Program, which provides
on-demand technical advisory services support to help the government meet its obligations in transactions
with the private sector with the aim of increasing private sector investment in the infrastructure sectors.
94. Since the awarding of the railway concession to Railway Systems of Zambia (RSZ) in December
2003, the sub-sector has been characterized by under investment, inefficient operations, and general
misunderstanding between the government and the concessionaire on some sections of the concession
agreement and levels of investment. A review of the Zambia railway concession will be carried out to
address issues of capacity to monitor and manage the concession on the part of Zambia Railways Limited,
the firm appointed by the government to manage the concession. A feasibility study to connect a railway
line between Mchinji railway line and the TAZARA railway line on the Nacala Corridor will be
undertaken to evaluate the potential for exploiting the significantly underutilized natural resources that
exist in Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique.
95. Water Supply and Sanitation. The key objective of Bank involvement is to increase and sustain
access to water supply and sanitation in both urban and rural areas, by strengthening the institutional and
policy frameworks and improving delivery systems. At one end of the scale are large urban towns, such
as Lusaka, in which a core urban conurbation is served by a piped water network with a water-borne
sewerage system, although only a very small proportion of the population is served by the sewerage
system. At the other end are “rural” towns, such as Lufwanyama, that have no piped system of any kind
and rely solely on point water sources and onsite sanitation facilities. This urban-rural distinction is,
however, ambiguous in its application to a large number of towns that have both urban and rural
characteristics. The definition also forces preponderance toward point sources, even for rural settlements
where a piped network might be a better option. It also prevents the development of independent piped
systems in peri urban areas, which could be managed as separate small town networks, especially in the
large cities.
96. Because Zambia is soon to be covered by regional water utilities, it is necessary to define a
framework for delivery of services that allows a utility and the local authorities the flexibility to
effectively design, implement, and manage different systems for different settlement types, building on
economies of scale, without the hindrance of the artificial boundaries implied by the current rural-urban
dichotomy. The CAS will support the implementation of a Small Towns Water and Sanitation Services
Project in selected regional utilities focusing on the provision of services to small towns. The project
components will include (a) water services delivery; (b) sanitation and hygiene promotion; and (c) policy
dialogue and dissemination of key findings and recommendations from analytical work. The Bank’s
current involvement in urban areas through the Water Sector Performance Improvement Project will also
continue during the CAS period. A Water Pollution and Supply Solutions study will be undertaken to
explore the linkages between the management and supply of water in rural areas. This will include water
quality studies linked to water-related public health issues and explore appropriate water supply solutions.
97. With regard to water resources development, the Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy will
provide the analytical foundation for Bank support. This will include a review of the international
experience in the development of small dam programs to identify the range of benefits and issues that

27

need to be addressed in increasing rural competitiveness and reducing vulnerability to the potential impact
associated with climate change. Lending will be in form of the Water Resources Development Project that
would support implementation of the new water resources legislation and the development of small- and
medium-scale water resources infrastructure to secure a platform for economic growth and development.
Zambia is a key riparian country in two important international river basins—the Zambezi and the Congo.
The development and use of these water resources hold great potential for energy production, agriculture,
transport, fisheries, and tourism. The Bank is undertaking a multi-sector investment identification analysis
covering the whole Zambezi River Basin to determine the potential for cooperative and joint development
that will optimize the benefits for all riparian countries. This will also guide the Bank's future engagement
in the Zambezi Basin in a role similar to that undertaken by the Bank on the Nile, Niger, and Senegal
River Basins, with an emphasis on regional investment opportunities.
98. Agricultural Development. In agriculture, the objective is to improve the supply response to market
opportunities for targeted emergent and smallholder farmers through public-private partnerships for
irrigation development. This will be achieved by improving farmer access to irrigation through the
funding of large-scale bulk water supply infrastructure, with a concomitant development of on-farm
irrigation infrastructure and improving the competitiveness of smallholder agriculture through the
provision of technical support for irrigation management, market access, and farm management. This
objective will be supported through the proposed Irrigation Development Project that is expected to
develop up to 11,000 ha of new irrigation, which would contribute to achieving the FNDP target of
development of 70,000 ha of new irrigation in Zambia. The interventions under the Irrigation
Development Project will complement the on-going support for smallholder agriculture
commercialization along value chains, which is supported by the Agricultural Development Support
Project (ADSP). The project builds market, technical and managerial knowledge of agro-businesses,
farmer groups and producer organizations through extension, applied research and technology transfers
through interventions aimed at increased markets and competitiveness of agricultural produce, and
strengthen the capacity of selected public institutions. Furthermore, the project provides targeted
investments into core rural road network in high potential agriculture areas, which complement other
Bank supported investments into transport infrastructure.
99. Institutional Capacity. Although Zambia has a full array of formal institutions characteristic of a
liberal democracy, a priority expressed in the FNDP is to make them more service oriented and
accountable to the people. Recent analytical work undertaken by the Bank concludes that if Zambia’s
development policymaking is to become more effective in achieving results, it needs to go beyond a
preoccupation with unachievable “optimal” policies and take local governance realities into account more
systematically. Therefore, the approach taken in this CAS is to seek out incremental institutional reform
options that are feasible, given the realities of Zambia’s political economy, and focus engagement
narrowly, targeting very specific interventions, where development goals appear to be better aligned with
local incentives.
100. Public Sector Management. Consistent with the priority to help Zambia better manage its resources
will be the continuation of the ongoing Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
(PEMFA) Program, whose aim is to improve government capacity to effectively and efficiently mobilize
and use public resources and strengthen financial accountability. At the heart of the program is an
integrated system of financial management and reporting that will result in a better match between
government policy, budgets, and actual expenditures, so that the objectives of the FNDP can be realized.
Key elements of the program include an integrated financial management information system,
development of a macroeconomic model, improved budget presentation, a better cash release system, a
debt management strategy, strengthening of internal and external audit functions and parliamentary
committees, and reform of the public procurement system. The program is jointly supported by the World
Bank, U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the European Commission, Norway,

Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Ireland, and UNDP (Box 2). A 2005 assessment
of public financial management systems using the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) framework (Annex 7) indicated significant improvements in six main areas of PFM but also
indicated that deeper reforms were needed to achieve better budget outcomes and to improve financial
accountability. Recent improvements in national procurement and financial management systems has
resulted in increased reliance by cooperating partners on country systems, consistent with the goals of the
Paris Declaration (Para 129).
101. Given the expected substantial inflows from copper, better management of revenues will be
imperative, especially (a) smoothing revenues and expenditures over time (taking into account the
absorptive capacity of the economy); (b) saving for future generations; and (c) improving public
expenditure management at all levels of government—especially local—so that revenues are used to
benefit the people and accelerate diversified growth. To address transparency and accountability in the
management of revenues, the Bank will also support the Government to implement the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). EITI aims to improve governance through the verification and
full publication of company payments and government receipts from the mining sector. It is a tripartite
process, involving government, industry, and civil society stakeholders. Knowing what companies pay
and what governments receive is a critical first step in improving governance in the minerals sector and
holding decision-makers accountable on the use of mining sector revenues. However, EITI is narrowly
focused and goes only so far. Beyond EITI (the EITI++ approach), maximizing the development impact
from the mining resource boom will require addressing the entire mining resource value chain, from
support for the upstream award of contracts, to the fiscal audit of large tax payers and the collection of
taxes and royalties, revenue distribution and management, and also to the downstream quality of
expenditures. While downstream revenue and expenditure management issues will be addressed in the
PER, the EITI ++ focus will be on the upstream in helping the Government maximize its share of the
benefits derived from its mineral endowment by strengthening (a) fiscal audits to ensure that what mining
companies have paid is what should have been paid under the legislation, mine development agreements
and other obligations; (b) cost and production audits, to ensure that mineral output, prices and transfers

are properly captured and reported; and (c) the management and value of its residual interest in formerly
state-owned mines through ZCCM-IH, with a view to the eventual transfer of remaining assets.
102. Linked to the PEMFA program is the support the World Bank, DFID, Sweden, and Finland are
providing through the Public Service Management (PSM) Program, which focuses on the effective
management of the people employed in the public service in order to improve their performance and that
of the ministries and institutions for which they work. This program builds upon right-sizing, pay, and
performance management reforms that the government launched in 1993 and that were given further
impetus through the World Bank–funded PSCAP Project and the support from DFID. In addition to
traditional supply- side measures, such as employment and pay reform, PSM also supports demand-side
interventions to empower citizens and clients to put legitimate pressure on the public service to enhance
the delivery of services.
103. The 2008–11 CAS will continue to support the strengthening of the regulatory and licensing
function of the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources through the SEED Project.
Under SEED, a one-stop shop for investors is being piloted in Livingstone, as is building the capacity of
ZAWA to manage and coordinate the management of the wildlife estates in Kafue National Park. This
project will contribute to substantial biodiversity conservation over a mega-ecosystem with, because of its
size and orientation, built-in resilience to climatic variations. In addition, the CAS will support the scaling
up of ZAWA’s strategy for public-private partnerships. This will be tested in two national parks, Kasanka
and Lavushi Manda, as well as in a trans-frontier conservation area, the Nyika TFCA with Malawi. To
bridge the gap between very small community enterprises that can offer tourism-related services and
larger investments, such as lodges or sport activities, and link them both to international markets, the

104. Open Africa Project will help establish tourism routes in biodiversity-rich areas in northern
Namibia and Zambia. The Global Environment Facility will fund these three operations.
105. In addition to these initiatives, several ongoing Bank activities are expected to contribute to local
capacity building, especially in areas of financial and fiscal management. These include analytical tasks,
such as the Country Financial Accountability Assessment, the Public Expenditure Review, and the
OECD/DAC procurement assessment efforts, all of which will strengthen public financial management
and procurement. To better understand how growth will impact poverty and change the composition of
the poor, the Bank will work with the Central Statistical Office to help strengthen capacity for carrying
out household income and expenditure surveys and will carry out a joint poverty assessment.
106. Private Sector Development. The CAS will support the government’s objectives of broad-based
wealth creation by helping Zambian entrepreneurs become more competitive. The focus will be on (a)
helping micro, small and medium-size enterprises start and grow their businesses and (b) improving
productivity by helping the government address systemic constraints, such as limited access to financial
services, high transport costs, cumbersome licensing procedures, and the inefficient land tenure system.
Helping institutions encourage competitiveness and firm level productivity is an essential part of
facilitating pro-poor growth because it facilitates new entry and encourages incumbent institutions to seek
profitable ways of providing goods and services to previously excluded segments of the population.
Increased competition improves the speed with which access-improving policies and technologies are
adopted.
107. Multiple interventions are envisioned including a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),
the objective of which will be (a) to understand recent developments and vulnerabilities in the Zambian
financial sector, as well as fragilities in the financial sector that could negatively affect the financial
system; (b) to explore with the authorities, and through meetings with selected market participants, the
main policy issues and reform priorities in the financial sector; and (c) to prepare assessments of
compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (BCPs), the Core Principles
for Systemically Important Payment Systems (CPSIPS), and the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating

31

the Financing of Terrorism Work (AML/CFT). A more detailed examination of the areas that hinder
productivity of local firms will be assessed through an Investment Climate Assessment, which will assess
the performance of firms in urban areas, while a Rural Competitiveness Survey will use a similar
methodology to survey firms in rural areas. Undertaking value chain work in sectors such as tourism and
mining will highlight constraints to competitiveness and provide a means of generating consensus about
what is required to dismantle such constraints. Since value chain analysis follows the product flow from
the initial point of production to the final point of consumption, it enables tracking of specific cost
components and allows benchmarking against the key comparators. These initiatives will result in policy
and programmatic recommendations tailored to the needs of rural and urban firms, in both the formal and
informal sectors, and will enable the government and other cooperating partners to develop targeted
approaches to increasing productivity, thereby generating jobs and growth in both rural and urban areas.
These recommendations could be supported through a Competitiveness DPL, which would provide a
vehicle for Government to implement priority reforms emerging from the Financial Sector Assessment
Program update, the Investment Climate Assessment, and the Rural Competitiveness Study.
108. Human Capital Development. The government has indicated that it would prefer to use scarce
IDA resources for financing infrastructure and will finance social sector interventions either through its
own resources or through grant financing. However, Government and cooperating partners indicate that
there is demand for the Bank’s analytical leadership in the social sectors and it is therefore intended that
over the 2008–11 CAS, the Bank will focus on analytical activities in the social sectors, including
managing grant funding associated with global programs and grant resources provided by bilateral
cooperating partners (Table 7).

109. Education. In the education sector, proposed analytical work will identify key issues and help
formulate strategies for post-basic education, particularly with respect to its relation to the technical and
vocational education and training, to meet Zambia’s long-term human resources need for broad-based
economic growth. It will also provide key diagnostic analysis to the current low student achievement at
the basic education level, with focus on teacher quality and performance and classroom instruction. This
will lead to policy recommendations to improve learning outcomes in Zambia, particularly the learning
gap between students from urban and rural areas. A new medium-term education sector strategy has been
finalized with the Bank’s technical assistance. The Bank will assist Zambia to apply for grant funding
from the multi-donor EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI) catalytic fund to fill the existing financing gap,
following submission of the endorsement package to the FTI secretariat. The Bank will also lead the
supervision of the FTI catalytic fund implementation aimed at assisting Zambia in moving toward
universal completion of basic education with good quality, harmonizing other development partners’
support in education, continuing sector dialogue, and providing crucial technical assistance to speed up
implementation. For the future, improving labor productivity is going to be essential for increased
competitiveness and diversification of the economy. In addition to the ongoing technical and vocational
development program, the Bank will consult government, COMESA, and SADC and explore
opportunities for coordination on human resources development. Discussions are presently underway to
develop regional centers of excellence for prioritized skills at different locations in Africa and one
possibility could be to tap the agricultural research network that COMESA is already working with.
110. Health. At the request of the Government the Bank, in close collaboration with other cooperating
partners (Box 3), will continue to provide support to the Ministry of Health and the National AIDS
Council on health system strategy and planning, consistent with the emphasis in the National Health
Strategic Plan 2006–10 and the FNDP. Health system strategy and planning will be supported through the
preparation of a comprehensive Health Sector Report, which will include costing and identification of
mechanisms to scale up health-related Millennium Development Goals and an estimate of the financing
gap to reach those goals. The report will also include an HIV/AIDS epidemiological synthesis and
support for development of an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy, as well as diagnostic analysis to
strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems; national HIV/AIDS spending analysis, including an
HIV/AIDS public expenditure tracking survey; analysis of human resource issues and policy options to
help Zambia improve the quality of human resources in the health sector; and a review of the resource
allocation criteria used to determine the health sector budget. The Bank will also explore with the
government the possibility of Zambia joining the Southern Africa HIV/AIDS Program for Transport

33

Corridors, potentially through bilateral financing. A social impact analysis and financing needs
assessment will be carried out to assess gender inequalities in the sector, including piloting a results-based
financing program to improve maternal health in Zambia. The ongoing Malaria Booster Project, including
the Russian Trust Fund for Malaria, will support successful scale up of prevention activities, supply chain
management for malaria commodities, and monitoring and evaluation of results. Worsening maternal
mortality will be a subject of special focus, financed through the Norwegian Trust Fund.
111. It is envisaged that the Bank will contribute to the government’s social protection efforts by (a)
evaluating current social cash transfer schemes; (b) building institutional capacity for social protection
programs; (c) helping to understand the dynamics of the informal labor market; and (d) promoting
livelihoods for the vulnerable youth.
D. The Focus of IFC and MIGA
112. As part of the International Finance Corporation’s strategic initiative for Africa, IFC is looking to
increase its engagement in Zambia. Through a number of business development missions, opportunities
have been identified in the agribusiness, tourism, financial, energy, mining, and commercial real estate
development sectors. These opportunities are now being assessed for investment viability. Providing
technical assistance to promote development of small and medium-size enterprises and improve access to
finance is also being considered. IFC is providing advisory services for the green field 750 megawatt
Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Project, which is likely to be backed by an IDA partial risk guarantee, with
both IDA and IFC teams working together closely. In support of the housing market, in November 2006
IFC committed a US$21 million equity investment in one of its first real estate investments in Africa—a
regional property development company called Areco. Areco will invest in middle-income residential
projects and related infrastructure, starting in Zambia, and expanding into neighboring countries. IFC is
also assessing supporting a local building society that is seeking to grow its housing loan book and
develop mortgage financing that exceeds the five years typically available for housing finance in Zambia.
In December 2007, IFC signed a loan agreement for US$5 million with Madison, Zambia’s largest
insurer. IFC will also take up equity of US$2 million in the company.
113. In supporting small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), following a successful pilot with Konkola
Copper Mines, IFC is now expanding the Copperbelt SME Suppliers Development Program. This will
provide customized technical assistance to an expected 150 SMEs that supply the mining companies. PEP
Africa will manage the program, which enjoys strong support from the mining companies in addition to
its target SMEs. IFC is also seeking to provide investment support to increase the SMEs' access to finance
via partner banks. IFC’s portfolio in Zambia currently totals US$21million.
114. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) mitigates noncommercial risks by insuring
investments against various risks, including the risks of war and civil disturbance, transfer restriction, and
expropriation of funds. MIGA has issued a number of guarantees in Zambia in support of projects in the
mining, agribusiness, services, and manufacturing sectors. Despite the historically small presence in
Zambia, the focus on increasing investments in infrastructure and agriculture indicates a potentially
increased role for MIGA in these areas, by providing an enabling environment for facilitation of private
sector investment in areas such as power generation and agribusiness. IDA’s collaboration with MIGA
and IFC will be systematic to develop financing solutions for large infrastructure and regional projects.
E. The Good Governance and Anticorruption Agenda
115. Zambia continues to wrestle with significant governance challenges and ranks among Sub-Saharan
Africa’s poorer performers in the control of corruption. Over the upcoming CAS period, the World Bank

34

Group will respond proactively to these realities by making a special effort to apply emerging good
governance and anticorruption (GAC) practices in the country program.
116. Smart Project Design. An intensified focus on the GAC dimensions of Bank operations will
require heightened attention to three aspects of operational preparation.
117. Upstream Diagnosis. The first step in aligning operational design to a challenging GAC
environment is to have a clear-sighted understanding of the incentives and capacities of the implementing
agency, of the leadership layers to which that agency reports, and of other key counterparts. The
governance assessment conducted upstream of this CAS provides a useful starting point. Going forward,
similar sector-specific assessments (e.g., for the roads sector) will be undertaken before each operation as
part of project preparation. One useful tool that will be explored is value chain analysis, which helps
direct attention to specific “choke points” of heightened corruption risk.
118. Mainstreaming Transparency, Participation, and Third-Party Monitoring in Operational Design.
Experience the world over confirms that strengthening the engagement of nongovernmental project
stakeholders enhances development effectiveness and reduces corruption risk. Going forward, the Bank’s
new operations in Zambia will be designed: (a) to help foster transparency, both in the specific areas of
operational focus and in the relevant sector more broadly (e.g., by building into the operational design
period service provision surveys and other monitoring mechanisms and by encouraging transparent, realtime reporting of resource flows) and (b) to systematically engage stakeholders in operational design and
continuing oversight and implementation, focusing especially on service recipients and others with a
direct stake in the operation’s success.
119. Incorporating Anticorruption Actions into Project Documentation. Every new operation will be
accompanied by an anticorruption action plan. The elements of this action plan (including the design
features listed above and the approaches to implementation described below) will be explicitly included in
project documentation (both appraisal and the project implementation plan) as part of the project record.
Project preparation and documentation will also clarify up-front the approaches to be adopted in handling
allegations of corruption, as well as sanctions and remedies.
120. Project Implementation. Project implementation will sustain the focus on good governance and
anticorruption efforts in two ways.
121. Ongoing Outreach to Stakeholders. During implementation, continued emphasis will be given to
transparency and participation. As feasible, this will include: (a) enhanced real-time disclosure of the
processing steps for project implementation (including procurement documentation); (b) third-party
monitoring of procurement; (c) participatory oversight; (d) outreach to media; and (e) expanded use of
service provision performance surveys and other feedback mechanisms (including a complaints hotline).
122. Proactive Supervision Arrangements. Scaled-up efforts by the Bank’s Department of Institutional
Integrity have yielded a variety of lessons as to how the Bank can supervise high-risk operations more
effectively. Key areas of focus include: (a) careful monitoring to combat collusion, forgery, and fraud; (b)
strengthened arrangements for ensuring independence, integrity, and competence of auditors of Banksupported projects; and (c) clear, streamlined arrangements for handling complaints. Going forward, the
World Bank Group’s Zambia country team will incorporate these lessons into supervision.
123. The approaches to project design and supervision described above can be more readily incorporated
into new operations than into the ongoing portfolio. Nonetheless, early in the next CAS cycle, the Bank
will take stock of the existing portfolio to assess corruption risks. For risky projects, mid-term reviews

35

will be used to assess the anticorruption strategy in these operations and to suggest potential high-return
modifications.
124. Synergies to Strengthen Country Systems. Going forward, Bank supported operations will
account for only a very small proportion of Zambia’s public expenditures. The developmental returns
from enhanced anticorruption efforts thus are overwhelmingly determined by their broader impact on
Zambian processes for managing public resources. Under the JASZ framework, several cooperating
partners are supporting Government’s efforts to implement a wide set of institutional reforms aimed at
improving governance including access to justice, anti corruption, and support to civil society
organizations (Box 2). Over the upcoming CAS period, the Bank will support improvements in these
processes in three ways.
125. Synergies between Bank Operations and Country Systems. Going forward, Bank projects will not
focus exclusively on project-specific implementation arrangements, but will support both institutional
reforms and implementation arrangements that contribute to national capacity in the relevant sector. This
will include: (a) adopting project-specific procurement and financial management arrangements that to
the fullest feasible extent help enhance sectoral capacity in these areas; (b) adopting project-specific
approaches to transparency, participation, and third-party monitoring that have the potential to be
mainstreamed as part of the Zambian governance system within the relevant sector; and (c) supporting,
with other cooperating partners, the governance agenda that has already been identified under the PEMFA
program.
126. Cross-cutting Improvements in Governance. In the upcoming CAS period, it is not proposed that
there be a new IDA operation focused on core governance. Over this period, the Bank will continue to
support the core governance agenda in two ways: (a) by engaging, in partnership with other donors, in
periodic analytical work to monitor trends in the quality of both public management and accountability
institutions and (b) by responding, on a demand-driven basis, to requests from specific public and civil
society Zambian organizations seeking support for their capacity building efforts—either by directly
providing modest support or by working with other development partners to make available the requisite
resources.
127. Organizing the Country Team. As required by the Bank wide GAC strategy and implementation
plan, recognition by the full Zambia team that “governance is everybody’s business” is key to effective
follow-through on the agenda outlined above. To get to this point, Bank country programs that have
adopted an intensified approach to managing the GAC dimensions of operations have found it useful to
establish a Governance and Anti-Corruption Advisory Committee within the country team. In these
country programs, the GAC Advisory Committee generally (a) offers guidance on operational design; (b)
reviews and clears project documents, and (c) facilitates support for staff confronting difficult issues. For
the next phase of CAS implementation, the Zambia program has established a GAC Advisory Committee
with a similar mandate.

36

V. Aid Coordination, Harmonization, and Consultation
128. Aid Coordination and Harmonization. To better manage their development cooperation with the
government and align their assistance with the FNDP, a Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia (JASZ) was
prepared in April 2007 and signed by sixteen cooperating partners.28 These included twelve bilateral
donors and four multilateral agencies, including the African Development Bank, the European
Commission, the United Nations system, and the World Bank. Of these signatories Germany, Great
Britain, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden decided to replace their current country strategies for development
cooperation with the JASZ. The other signatories decided that, while maintaining their individual country
strategies, they will align their strategies with the JASZ framework. It is envisaged that linking the
international arrangements signed under the Paris Declaration with the effectiveness criteria discussed in
Zambia's aid policy and strategy29 will result in lower transaction costs, more effective official
development assistance, greater mutual accountability, and stronger local ownership of the development
process. More concretely, the key objectives of the JASZ are:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

To establish a shared vision and guiding principles for cooperating partners’ support to the
objectives of the FNDP, which is the first stage in meeting the Vision 2030
To articulate priorities for support during the plan period
To replace or better align cooperating partners’ country strategies (including resource allocations)
with FNDP priorities, targets, and country systems
To improve aid delivery by achieving more effective division of labor and allocation of
cooperating partners’' resources
To deepen the results focus of assistance programs
To simplify aid management and improve aid predictability
To reduce transaction costs for the government.

As part of the JASZ process, and following extensive consultations, a Division of Labor matrix (Annex 6)
was agreed among Government and cooperating partners and finalized in June 2006. Under the Division
of Labor principles, two to three lead cooperating partners are identified for each sector and they are
responsible for coordinating dialogue and programs between the Government and other partners active in
the sector. The sectoral classification in the Division of Labor matrix is consistent with the FNDP.
129. Cooperating partners recognize that a fully subscribed JASZ provides a unique opportunity to
develop a joint analytical and programmatic response to the FNDP. It is, however, agreed that the JASZ
does not constitute an international treaty or any other legally binding document. To the extent that the
JASZ is inconsistent with the laws, policies, or commitments of any signatory, such laws, policies, or
commitments will prevail. The Zambian authorities have indicated that, to the extent possible, Zambia
will leverage its membership in SADC and COMESA to coordinate policies across member countries in
order to harmonize development partner support.
130. Zambia has recently undertaken a review of the Paris Declaration indicators and results indicate
that, notwithstanding challenges in aligning assistance to country financial management and procurement

systems due to weaknesses in the institutional and legal framework, there has been an encouraging
increase in the use of country systems by cooperating partners in Zambia. The 2010 implicit target of 60
percent of aid using Zambia’s procurement system has already been exceeded and there has been similar
progress in the use of national systems for budget execution, financial reporting and audit. There has also
been a reduction in the number of Project Implementation Units and all new projects are being
mainstreamed.
131. Consultations. As an input into the preparation of the CAS, approximately 325 stakeholders of the
World Bank in Zambia were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by
participating in a client survey in June 2007 (Figure 5 summarizes the results). Participants in the survey
were drawn from among the offices of the president and vice president, ministers, parliamentarians,
employees from government ministries, departments and implementation agencies, local government
councils, bilateral and multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, nongovernmental organizations,
the media, independent government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, academia, research or
vocational institutes, and the judiciary. A total of 319 stakeholders participated in the client survey
(response rate of 98 percent). Using a questionnaire, respondents were asked to indicate their overall
attitudes toward the Bank, the importance of specific areas of the Bank’s work and the Bank’s
effectiveness in those areas, and their level of agreement with a series of statements about the way the
World Bank does business. Respondents were also asked about general issues facing Zambia, the Bank’s
future role in Zambia, and the Bank’s communication and outreach efforts in Zambia.
132. Across all stakeholder groups, financial resources, knowledge, and technical advice emerged as the
greatest value that the Bank brings to Zambia. In comparison to data collected from the client survey
taken in fiscal 2004, a much greater percentage of respondents in fiscal 2007 identified knowledge and
policy advice as the most valued aspects of the Bank’s work, while the percentage identifying financial
resources as the greatest value has gone down significantly. In order for the Bank to “make itself of
greater value in Zambia” a plurality reported that it needed to improve the quality of its experts as related
to Zambia’s specific challenges and reduce the complexity of obtaining World Bank financing. Nearly

38

three-quarters of all respondents felt that the Bank should provide greater support for rural areas in
Zambia in the next few years. As summarized in Figure 5, areas that were identified as a priority and
where respondents felt the Bank had a comparative advantage included economic growth, infrastructure,
financial systems, agricultural development, transparency in governance, and health and education.
133. In addition to the survey, consultations were also held with various government agencies, civil
society organizations, and representatives from the private sector and cooperating partners. Overall, these
discussions confirmed that the Bank’s focus on growth, infrastructure development, public expenditure
management, reducing the cost of doing business, and the agriculture sector was appropriate and these
interventions were well aligned with the objectives of the FNDP. Most respondents applauded the
increased focus on results taken by the CAS and urged the Bank to put in place a system of monitoring
and evaluation against which progress could be objectively measured.

VI. Managing Effectively for Results
134. The results framework developed for this CAS places central emphasis on outcomes, and the results
chain that has been developed ensures alignment with the FNDP and the JASZ. Measurable, core
indicators have been developed, together with a monitoring and evaluation framework that will help
determine whether Bank operations and the overall portfolio is successfully contributing to Zambia’s
development goals as laid out in the FNDP. A set of milestones has been defined for each outcome
indicator to give early warning if achievement of an envisaged result is not on track. The results matrix
takes a realistic and prudent approach to outcome indicators to allow attributing results to Bank
interventions as clearly as possible and practical. While not always easily quantifiable, a special emphasis
was given to outcomes from AAA work to strengthen the overall results orientation of the country
program. Relevant higher level outcome indicators which GRZ uses to measure progress towards
longer-term country goals—FNDP key performance indicators (KPI) and the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF) indicators— are presented in a separate table in Annex 1C for better readability.
These are influenced directly or indirectly by CAS outcomes. The detailed results matrix is attached as
Annex IA, and Figure 6 summarizes the results chain and the linkages with the FNDP and JASZ.
135. Learning from the experience described in past CAS completion reports, a rigorous monitoring and
evaluation plan has been developed for this CAS, which assigns clear responsibilities for each CAS
outcome indicator, including milestones and sources of data. To promote transparency in results and
results monitoring, it is intended that intermediary and final results from Bank financed interventions will
be made available to the public by publishing results snapshots on the Zambia country office website, as
well as actively contributing to the Africa Results Monitoring System.30 The team is also assessing the
possibility of putting in place a system that will allow monitoring the progress of the CAS online. It is
intended that the country portfolio performance review will focus on monitoring and evaluation, assess
the consistency of data collection and monitoring efforts in ongoing and planned operations, and provide
recommendations for better integration.
136. To focus on results and on monitoring and evaluation, it is intended that a Monitoring and
Evaluation Practice Group will be established to take the process of managing for results to the next level.
The group will initially comprise task leaders, team members, and monitoring and evaluation specialists

working on the Zambia program. The team will benefit from peer inputs and discussions, including from
organized learning inputs and events. The possibility of widening this group geographically to include
Bank teams from Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe will be reviewed, as well as the
usefulness of periodically inviting participation by relevant members from civil society and other
cooperation partners.

VII. Risks and Mitigation
137. Although the overall outlook for Zambia remains broadly positive, the country faces several risks:
•

Political Economy Risk. There is a risk of inaction or delayed action —i.e., the policy makers
will not be able to build the consensus necessary to address some of the structural constraints that
are preventing accelerated growth and poverty reduction in Zambia—issues such as land
administration reform, reforms of the labor market, deregulation of the telecommunications
sector, and reforms in the energy sector. The copper boom presents an opportunity that can allow
Zambians to take advantage of the country’s abundant natural resources and translate the
proceeds into a better life for themselves. This did not happen during the last copper boom in the
mid-1970s, which was followed by two decades of economic decline. Within Zambia, there is
increased debate and growing awareness of the costs of not addressing structural constraints and
it is expected that this will strengthen the hand of reform champions within Government, a

40

process that the CAS intends to support. The CAS will also aim to mitigate this risk by focusing
on improved transparency and accountability in the use of extractive industry revenues, the
institutional strengthening of key oversight agencies, and supporting other bottom-up initiatives
that emphasize good governance.
•

Insufficient Capacity Risk. Reinforcing the political economy risk is that of limited capacity,
which prevents local groups within and outside the government from evaluating policy options
and influencing the leadership to put in place the enabling environment necessary to move the
economy to a higher growth trajectory. Even when enabling policies are adopted, weak capacity
delays implementation. Capacity limitations tend to make many reform initiatives appear to be
externally driven, even if there is a broad consensus of the need for some of these reforms. Such
capacity constraints also encourage inertia within various government agencies, so that although
the solutions to many issues are well known and understood, the system is unable to respond and
address them. The Bank, in close collaboration with other cooperating partners, continues to
support Zambia’s Public Sector Reform Program, which aims to improve analytical and
implementation capacity within Government. In addition to ongoing programs, Government is
presently considering options to selectively implement a capacity enhancement program in two or
three key ministries, with support from cooperating partners.

•

External Shocks Risk. Given the cyclical nature of commodity prices, there is a risk that copper
prices might decline and adversely affect the country’s balance of payments position. This could
be aggravated by the increased international price for petroleum products, which could result in
be macroeconomic instability. In addition, Zambia is also at risk for climate shocks such as heavy
rains that result in flooding, reducing harvest and also destroying roads and bridges. Increases in
the price of energy and food products could undermine the recent progress Zambia has made in
reducing inflation. Through improved public expenditure management and other initiatives
discussed earlier, the CAS will assist the authorities in promoting more effective use of public
resources that will result in increased diversification and competitiveness, including the ability to
better adapt to external shocks. In addition, the Government of Zambia is committed to ensuring
that its monetary and fiscal program will keep inflation in check, as has been the case over the
past few years.

•

Mineral Wealth Risk. There is a risk that continued high copper prices might drive up the real
effective exchange rate and, if not managed properly, could result in the economy exhibiting
Dutch Disease symptoms. If so, the result would likely be a decline in nontraditional exports,
especially those in the agriculture sector. The CAS, in collaboration with other Cooperating
Partners, will support Government’s efforts to build capacity to better manage its natural resource
wealth. As part of the process of implementing the EITI ++ initiative, assistance will be provided
to manage the macro economy in the presence of a commodity boom; to manage the inherent
volatility of mineral revenues; to direct resources to those programs that have the highest
economic returns; and to transparently account for the mineral resources acquired.

•

Energy Sector Risk. Zambia, like many of its neighboring economies, is beginning to experience
a severe energy shortage, which if not addressed urgently will undermine the country’s growth
objectives. Low access to electrical power sources is the result of low tariffs and the high
operational losses of the utility, ZESCO, which has been unable to mobilize the investment
necessary to upgrade the transmission and distribution network. While there is increased investor
interest in new generation, Zambia will not be able to capitalize on this interest unless there is a
willingness to address the policy constraints in the energy sector. The recent energy crisis has

41

highlighted the need for energy sector reform and Government is beginning to examine policy
options in the sector with greater urgency.
•

HIV/AIDS Risk. At 16 percent, Zambia has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the
world. HIV/AIDS has devastated much of the population and brought life expectancy down to
about 40 years. Although the resources available to combat HIV/AIDS have increased
substantially in recent years, the government needs to ensure that the excellent effort that has
gone into combating this disease continues, especially at the community level, so that awareness
continues to increase and results in changing behavior patterns. The CAS requires that issues of
HIV/AIDS are mainstreamed in every project IDA finances.

138. Although these risks might appear to be daunting, they are not insurmountable. Zambia’s economic
performance during the past several years has been excellent, and the boom presently being experienced
has lifted many Zambians, especially in urban areas, out of poverty. This progress should be consolidated,
and it is imperative that an environment is created that will allow all Zambians to participate in and
benefit from the country’s growing wealth. Accelerating and sharing economic growth will require
addressing the numerous structural constraints the economy faces. This will also require that Government
work in close partnership with the private sector, civil society groups and its cooperating partners to
implement actions that can mitigate the risks discussed above. Such actions must include, among others,
continued emphasis on prudent macroeconomic management, a heightened sense of urgency to deal with
the energy crisis and focused attention to augment capacity in key Government ministries and
departments.

VIII. Conclusion
139. Zambia’s goals are indeed ambitious. By 2030, the country is committed to transforming itself from
a low-income country to a middle-income one. The Fifth National Development Plan, covering 2006–10,
is designed to foster a competitive and outward-oriented economy that can significantly reduce hunger
and poverty and increase “broad-based wealth and job creation through citizenry participation and
technological advancement.”
140. These goals are attainable, given Zambia’s great wealth of natural resources, its improving external
position, and its recent record of economic success. But success must be based on sound policies that
maintain macroeconomic stability, promote equitable development throughout the country, build the
business environment necessary to make Zambian products more competitive, and address the physical
and human resource constraints that now limit opportunities for the two-thirds of Zambians who live in
poverty.
141. The World Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for fiscal 2008–11 is designed to help the
government achieve its goals, within the principles agreed upon by all the partners supporting Zambia’s
development efforts, as articulated in the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia. This CAS marks a
departure from the past: from the broad goals of previous strategies, which sometimes went unrealized, to
an emphasis on specific, achievable results; from a broad based concessionary lending program to a more
focused one that complements the country’s new access to other financial resources including the fiscal
space provided by the debt relief initiative; and to more targeted analytical support that will guide and
strengthen the government’s own resources and programs.
142. This CAS focuses on highly selective interventions to maximize the impact of the government’s
development efforts, with two areas of special emphasis. First, because of the potential fiscal windfall
coming from the boom in copper prices, the CAS supports improved expenditure management and close

42

collaboration and monitoring with the government and local stakeholders to ensure that those revenues
are used wisely and effectively to benefit as many households as possible. Second, because of the
significant gaps between urban and rural areas, and the need for increased access to regional markets, the
CAS supports a program of investments in infrastructure that will increase economic opportunities for all
Zambians through improved connectivity and integration, resulting in increased competitiveness.
143. The Bank’s comparative advantage lies fundamentally in its ability to focus development resources
and priorities on these critical areas targeted in the CAS by using its convening power to leverage scarce
IDA resources. Thus, the CAS stresses the need for selectivity, prioritization, and an enhanced focus on
results, monitoring, and evaluation to assist Zambia in moving towards its goals of accelerating and
sharing growth.

Annex 7: Zambia: Integrated assessment of PFM performance using the Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) Framework - 2005
Zambia’s Public Financial Management (PFM) system is centered on a set of basic budget and accountability
structures around a clear legislative framework. These include: (i) responsibility and accountability for public
funds delegated to individuals through the system; (ii) appropriate oversight by the legislature; (iii) clear
statement of the powers and duties for the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) and for the
Auditor-General; and (iv) clear and well-documented roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders.
In recent years, there has been increased focus on accountability through the operation of Parliamentary
committees and the work of the Office of the Auditor General. Budget presentation has been clearer, with the
advent of activity-based budgets (ABB), and there has been greater Cabinet involvement earlier in the budget
process to discuss expenditure priorities and approve/issue ministry ceilings.
Measured against the six main PFM principles examined by the evaluation, it is clear that whilst there have been
significant improvements in recent years, further PFM reforms will be needed to achieve better budget outcomes
to deliver more efficient public services. Specifically:
• Credibility of the budget. With the high level of variance between budgeted and actual expenditures, the
original budget tends not to be an accurate predictor of budget outturns, particularly when it comes to individual
line ministries. Whilst outturns of revenues have on aggregate exceeded original budget projections, outturns of
expenditures on aggregate have diverged to a fair degree from the original budget projections.
• Comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget. The budget documents are reasonably transparent,
although the comprehensiveness of budget coverage could be improved. Significant fiscal information is available
to the public, but, in practice, the numbers of copies of reports printed are limited. The budget is focused only on
central government, presenting a partial fiscal picture and leading to potentially significant future liabilities for
the central Government.
• Policy-based budget. The introduction of the MTEF (the Green Paper), providing an overall medium-term
macro/fiscal resource framework and expenditure policies, and the issuing of Cabinet-approved ceilings at the
beginning of the budget preparation process have been very positive developments. Other improvements have
included the inclusion of external finance and the bringing together of recurrent and capital expenditures.
Improvements in the use of forward estimates and the linking of bottom-up planning and budgeting with the top
down resource framework will be required in order to make the budget an effective tool for government policy. A
review of the MTEF is planned for 2008.
• Predictability and control in budget execution. The implementation of a commitment control system during
the past two years has improved budgetary discipline. Nonetheless, effective expenditure controls are potentially
undermined by: (i) inaccurate and non-timely information (e.g. a lack of comprehensive information on actual
staff numbers results in the existence of ghost workers; (ii) retroactive adjustments in expenditures, indicating
weaknesses in expenditure control; (iii) weak links between commitment ceilings and cash flow
projections/monitoring and lack of communication of in-year expenditure authorization (monthly or quarterly
commitment ceilings) to line ministries; and (iv) capacity constraints, particularly with accounting and budget
analysis. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning has embarked upon Treasury Management reforms that
are intended to address some of the weaknesses in budget credibility. Procurement planning has also been
introduced in the MPSAs.
• Accounting, recording and reporting. Whilst there have been improvements in the efficiency of accounting,
capacity constraints and weaknesses in the accuracy and availability of financial information hinder the
effectiveness of financial management. Specific weaknesses include fragmentation in databases (e.g. payroll
management), and manual and paper-based elements of some systems, resulting in the lack of real-time
information for MoFNP and line ministry oversight. Implementation of IFMIS is finally underway and MoFNP
has been improving the existing access based FMS system to include commitment control and to improve security
features.
• External scrutiny and audit. External oversight has improved through the more timely preparation and
submission of Auditor-General reports to Parliament and the clearance of the backlog of outstanding reports.
Parliament has taken a more active role in scrutinizing the budget. However, there is a lack of effective follow-up
by the Executive.

Annex 8: Zambia: Progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals
Zambia’s National Vision 2030 is “to become a prosperous middle income country by the year
2030.” The government is using the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) as a vehicle to achieve
2030 Vision and the MDGs. The MDGs have been mainstreamed in the current sector plans and strategies
by the Sector Advisory Groups (SAGs), which comprised stakeholders, Government and Cooperating
Partners, as the key deliberative bodes for each sector. However, the achievement of the MDGs remains a
big challenge for the government mainly due to inadequate resources, weak infrastructure, inadequate
human resource capacity to deliver services and lack of decentralized system for delivery of services. The
financing gap for the FNDP is estimated at US$745.5 million.
MDG data monitoring
The institutional framework to monitor the MDGs in Zambia is incorporated in the FNDP
monitoring and evaluation Framework. Most indicators are either MDG related or linked to the MDGs. At
national level, monitoring of MDGs is done every two years through the National Task Force on MDGs
whose membership comprises Ministry of Finance and National Planning, Cabinet Office, Central
Statistical Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Energy and Water, Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources, The Zambia
Trade Net, Civil Society for Poverty Reduction, Global Compact Zambia and UN Country Team
including the World Bank. The National Advisory Group reviews progress on an annual basis. At sector
level, bi-annual monitoring of MDG related indicators is done through the SAGs. Development partners
supporting a particular sector participate in monitoring the implementation of MDGs through the SAGs.
However, some SAGs are not active and capacity to monitor and evaluate implementation of the sectoral
plans and strategies is still weak.
Current status of the MDGs
Zambia is currently preparing the third MDGs report for 2007 which will be out in April/May
2008. The second 2005 MDG report shows Zambia is moving in the right direction. This momentum can
only be maintained with renewed commitment, increase in public investment in social services, basic
infrastructure and environmental management. The status of MDGs is tabulated in Table 1 and 2.
According to the 2005 report, only two targets are unlikely to be met; reducing by three-quarters, between
1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio and integrating the principles of sustainable development into
country policies and program and reverse the loss of environmental resources. Other MDGs are either
possible or are likely to be met. However, for those which are still possible, implementation will need to
be accelerated if they are to be met by 2015.
Accelerating progress towards MDGs
(a) Accelerating progress towards MDGs within National Programs: To achieve the MDGs by 2015
largely depends on Zambia’s ability to scale up aid and investments in the economy, improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the utilization of resources in the public sector as well as maintaining the
current economic performance of reasonable growth. According to a report on the cost of meeting the
MDGs (Mphuka 2005), Zambia will need to invest an average of US$110 per capita per year in capital
and operating expenditures towards meeting the MDGs. The FNDP does not separate out the funding
required to meet the MDGs. The Government will therefore need to conduct a comprehensive MDG
costing exercise in relevant sectors that will guide resource mobilization, MTEF and FNDP in
implementation MDGs. Zambia’s accession of the HIPC completion point and the MDRI has created
further fiscal space, although in 2007, the government had approx.US$225million fiscal surplus mainly as
result of weaknesses in budget preparation and execution including weak capacity in implementation of

75

sectoral plans. In addition, the Government has recently announced a significant change in the fiscal
regime for the mining sector, which, when implemented, will greatly increase domestic savings available
for investment.
Efforts are being made to accelerate MDG implementation. For example in the health sector, an
institutional framework to accelerate implementation of health related MDGs through the health sector
wide approach (SWAps) is in place although it needs to be strengthened. The development partners34 are
supporting and monitoring implementation of the National Health Strategic Plan 2006-2011 whose theme
is “Towards the Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and National Health
Priorities”. Other partnerships have been created such as; (i) The Partnership on Maternal, Newborn and
Child Health35 for MDG 4 and 5. The road map has been developed but not yet costed. (ii) The Roll Back
Malaria Partnership36 supports implementation of MDG 6 through the strategy to scale-up for impact on
malaria in Zambia; and (iii) the Partnership on HIV and AIDS including the Country Coordinating
Mechanism (CCM) of the Global fund37 for MDG6 through the 2006-2010 National AIDS Strategic
Framework whose financing gap has been estimated at US$217 million.
In the water sector, the Government has developed an investment and capacity development plan
for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) and is in process of developing a similar one for urban
water supply and sanitation. Although some aspects of the RWSS plan are funded by GRZ and donor
funded projects, there is no comprehensive financing plan.

(b) Reinforcing the impact of Bank programs towards accelerating MDG results: There is an
opportunity for the Zambia Country Program to support acceleration of the MDGs through the new
Country Assistance Strategy for Zambia 2008-2011. If on the other hand the Government maintains its
current position of not using IDA credits to finance most of its development programs especially the
social sectors it will be difficult for the WB to actively support acceleration of MDG implementation.
However, based on the Banks comparative advantage in sector analysis and knowledge management, the
Bank will support the social sectors and attainment of the MDGs through technical assistance and policy
dialogue, grant support through donor initiated trust funds and analytical work to leverage other CPs and
Government’s own growing resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007 under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries38
November 20, 2007
External and public debt dynamics are assessed using the Low Income Country Debt Sustainability
Analysis (LIC DSA) framework.39 Fund and Bank staffs have concluded that Zambia’s risk of external
debt distress is low. Total public debt is sustainable under all scenarios. Zambia’s debt sustainability
outlook has strengthened substantially since 2005, mainly because of higher copper export receipts and
debt relief received under the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives. The baseline scenario shows that Zambia’s
public debt will improve further over the medium term as long as economic policies remain appropriate.
Debt ratios are expected to continue to be manageable, well below the risk thresholds, through 2027.
Underlying Macroeconomic Assumptions
The medium-term framework assumes that the Zambian economy will continue to perform well.
The baseline scenario assumes that real GDP growth remains strong, reflecting large-scale investments in
mining and other sectors. The current account deficit is expected to widen over the long run as copper
prices fall. Fiscal policies are assumed to remain targeted on limiting domestic borrowing to about
one percent of GDP annually. The key assumptions are summarized below. The assumptions for this LIC
DSA are broadly in line with those underlying the 2005 LIC DSA, except for GDP growth. The more
positive copper sector developments in 2006 and 2007 have been incorporated. While stronger growth is
assumed in the medium term, a more conservative approach is taken over the long term.
The baseline scenario is based on the following assumptions:
Economic growth: Real GDP would continue to grow at 6–6½ percent a year through 2012, supported
primarily by developments in the copper and construction sectors. Over time, however, the Zambian
economy is expected to diversify as noncopper sectors expand in response to an improved business
environment and infrastructure. In the long run Zambia’s growth is expected to stabilize at 4½ percent.
Inflation: Inflation should decline to about 5 percent, if monetary and fiscal policies continue to be
prudent.
External sector: Copper export volumes would grow at an average annual rate of about 10 percent
through 2012 and then 4½ percent through 2027. While copper will remain Zambia’s most important
export, its share in total exports is expected to fall from 78 percent in 2006 to 67 percent by 2012 and then

time, Zambia had reached HIPC completion but relief under the MDRI has not yet been delivered.

to about 63 percent by 2027.40 Imports are assumed to grow in line with GDP in the long run. Annual
foreign direct investment would peak at 7 percent of GDP in 2007 and decline to an average of
2½ percent for 2008–12 and to 1½ percent of GDP over the long run.
Government revenue and expenditure: Government revenues would rise gradually from 18.4 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 20 percent by 2027, mainly from improvements in tax administration; no change in the
tax system is assumed. Expenditures stay constant at about 25 percent of GDP.
Financing: Discussions with the authorities and main donors indicate that there are no plans currently to
scale up foreign financing (grants and loans), except for one donor. The baseline scenario therefore
assumes that annual external support will remain at about 6 percent of GDP during 2007-12, and then
decline to 4½ percent of GDP during 2013-17 and to 3 percent of GDP by 2027.41 The baseline assumes
support from emerging creditors, albeit at low levels. Annual external borrowing would remain at about
1 percent of GDP through 2012 and then decline to about ¾ percent through 2017 and ½ percent for the
rest of the period. Domestic financing would fall to 1 percent of GDP by 2009 and remain there over the
long term. These funds would be used mainly to finance infrastructure projects.
Contingent liabilities: Public Service Pension Fund’s liabilities would grow by ½ percent of GDP per
year.
External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Background
As a result of the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives, Zambia’s stock of external debt has declined
substantially.42 The external debt-to-GDP ratio declined from about 85 percent at the end of 2005 to
about 9 percent at the end of 2006. Several creditors have already delivered their share of debt relief.43
Multilateral Creditors: All multilateral creditors have provided HIPC relief. The AfDF, IDA, and the
Fund have fully delivered their share of MDRI relief.

40

The nominal growth of exports in U.S. dollar terms is negative for 2009–11 because the price of copper is
assumed to decline at an average annual rate of 20 percent over the next three years and at lower rates through 2013,
in line with WEO projections. It is assumed that the price of copper will stabilize after 2013.
41
In the baseline scenario a sizeable portion of grants are allocated to finance investment projects and classified as
capital grants.
42
Zambia reached the completion point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in April 2005. MDRI relief was
delivered in January 2006.
43
Arrears to private creditors, which accumulated because of limitations on the availability of foreign exchange
prior to 1985, have been excluded, since verification of outstanding claims to private individuals is not completed.

Senate to do so. Only one full member of the Paris Club (Russia) has not granted beyond HIPC relief to
Zambia, but discussions have started.44
Non-Paris Club Creditors: Of the nine non-Paris Club creditors, China and India have provided relief
on claims held by their governments but not on those held by public enterprises—Zambia plans to contact
them. Two creditors, Bulgaria and Iraq, have not yet provided HIPC relief, but the authorities have
contacted them. Three non-Paris Club creditors (Kuwait, Romania, and Yugoslavia) sold their claims on
Zambia to private creditors and have been fully repaid. Debt to the other two non-Paris Club creditors was
fully repaid without any HIPC relief.
Results of the External DSA
External debt burden indicators have improved substantially and are expected to remain well
below the risk thresholds over the projection period in the baseline scenario (Table 1). Zambia’s
external debt ratios remain well below the risk thresholds.45 The stock of debt is expected to increase to
about 12 percent of GDP through 2011 and then decline to single digits by 2017. The NPV of debt-toGDP is expected to climb from about 6 percent in 2007 to about 7 percent by 2011 and then decline to
about 4 percent—below the 40 percent threshold. As copper prices decline and production slows, the
NPV of debt-to-exports is projected to increase from 14 percent in 2007 to about 23 percent in 2012 and
stay there through 2027, well below the 150 percent threshold. The debt service-to-exports ratio is
expected to increase from 1 percent in 2007 to 2 percent by 2012 and to 2.2 percent by 2027.

44

Russia is working with the World Bank to develop a debt-for-development swap. This analysis assumes that
Russia has already delivered debt relief beyond HIPC.
45
The World Bank’s 2006 Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) based on the three-year average
ranks Zambia as a medium performer. Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Zambia are (i) NPV of debt-toGDP, 40 percent; (ii) NPV of debt-to-exports, 150 percent; (iii) NPV of debt-to-revenue, 250 percent; and (iv) debt
service to exports, 20 percent, and to revenue, 30 percent.

80

The standard sensitivity analysis points to a much reduced risk of debt distress (Table 2). Zambia’s
external debt position has become more resilient to exogenous shocks. In the alternative scenarios, the
ratio that deteriorates most is the NPV of debt-to-exports. This occurs when key variables are assumed to
grow at their historical averages (1997–2006), which reflect the poor performance of the Zambian
economy from 1997 through 2002. The external current account deficit would remain at 10.7 percent of
GDP from 2008 to 2027—significantly higher than the deficit assumed in the baseline scenario (3 percent
by 2020). As a result, the NPV of debt-to-exports rises to 45 percent by 2017 and to 106 percent by 2027.
All bound tests result in higher but stable ratios well below the thresholds. Thus, even under difficult
circumstances, Zambia’s risk of debt distress is low. The scenario based on historical averages points to
the need to diversify Zambia’s exports away from copper as a means to make it even more resilient to
external shocks.
Plans for substantial investment in power generation have been under discussion for a long time
(Table 1). Therefore, the 2005 LIC DSA included an alternative scenario of nonconcessional foreign
borrowing (US$1 billion for 2008–11).46 The update assumes construction of three new hydropower
plants (Itezhi Tezhi, Kariba North, and Lower Kafue Gorge) during 2009–15, the financing of which
requires US$1.2 billion. However, slightly more than 40 percent is expected to be financed with foreign
direct investment, reducing the nonconcessional borrowing required to about US$690 million.47 The nonconcessional borrowing will not significantly change the external debt outlook. During the construction
period, imports are expected to increase, but as projects are completed exports of electricity will come on
stream. The NPV of debt-to-export ratio will peak at 37 percent in 2012 (23 percent in the baseline
scenario) but will converge to the baseline scenario by 2027. The assumed borrowing on nonconcessional
terms does not pose any threat to the external debt sustainability; debt indicators even under the bound
test are below the thresholds.
Public Debt Sustainability Assessment
Background
The size and composition of Zambia’s public
debt have significantly changed. At end 2005,
total public debt was about 105 percent of GDP,
18 percent of which was domestic debt. After
extensive debt relief from foreign creditors,
Zambia’s public debt decreased to 27 percent of

GDP and domestic debt’s share increased to
about 70 percent.

GDP). Most securities are marketable (13 percent of GDP), however, there is no significant secondary
market. Foreign investment in government securities began in early 2005, after Zambia reached its HIPC
completion point. The estimated stock of government securities in the hands of foreigners has increased
from about US$150 million at end-2005 to about US$200 million by end-September 2007 (about 13
percent of the total domestic debt), of which close to 70 percent is short-term debt. This indicates that the
rollover risk is low and the possible pressure on reserves of a change in sentiment of foreign investors is
moderate.
Results of the Public DSA
In the baseline scenario, Zambia’s public debt is expected to decline over the projection period
(Table 3). The NPV of domestic debt would decline from 18.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to 10.4 percent by
2027. As a result of this and the decline in external debt, the NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP would
drop from about 27 percent to 16 percent by 2027. Thus, Zambia’s public debt is considered manageable,
as long as the authorities implement a cautious debt policy.
The standard sensitivity analysis shows that Zambia’s public debt is also more resilient to shocks.
The alternative scenarios and bound tests show that the outlook for public debt sustainability is benign,
except in the case of permanently lower GDP. In this scenario the NPV of debt-to-revenue rises from
about 97 percent to about 139 percent. In the bound tests, the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio climbs to
about 194 percent by 2027, which underscores the importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
achieve higher GDP growth.
Conclusions
Application of the LIC-DSA framework indicates that Zambia’s debt sustainability outlook has
strengthened substantially. Fund and Bank staffs consider that Zambia is at low risk of external debt
distress. The external debt indicators remain well below the thresholds in the alternative scenarios and the
bound stress tests. The risks to public debt are also low.

4

Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

5

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

6

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

7

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

8

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the NPV of new debt).

1

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.

2

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

3

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).

4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Executive Summary

i.
This CAS Completion Report covers the CAS for Zambia approved in March 2004 for
FY04-07.
ii.
The previous CAS (FY96-01) was deemed unsatisfactory by OED, partly due to the Bank
continuing to lend in the “high case scenario” in spite of Zambia’s poor performance and also that CAS
objectives were short of the Base case expectations
iii.
The results’ based CAS FY04-07 was also aligned with Zambia’s PRSP (2002-4) and mapped
explicit targets. During the course of implementation, an attempt as made to rework some indicators. As
a result of this exercise, some indicators were changed and in other instances, original indicators were not
monitored. The CAS Completion Report (CR) is based on original indicators.
iv.
Over the four-year period of the CAS, Bank support to Zambia was based on the following
strategic objectives: (i) sustained economic growth anchored in a diversified and export-oriented
economy; (ii) improving lives and protection of the vulnerable; and (iii) effectively and efficiently
managed public sector.
v.

Based on these objectives, it is the opinion of the CAS CR that Bank contribution to Zambia’s
longer term development goals through the pillar one-- sustained economic growth, has led to moderately
satisfactory outcomes with regard to improved management of public resources based on the lending and
diagnostic instruments. For instance, there has been capacity building in the office of the Auditor
General, an introduction of activity based budgeting under the MTEF and upgrading of the Financial
Management System. The PEMFAR diagnostic led to the signing of a government program supported by
several development partners aimed at consolidating the gains in expenditure management and financial
accountability. Further, there was a substantial contribution to the stable macro economic environment
through the Economic Management and Growth Facility. Progress has been made on improving financial
management and sustainability of infrastructure services (e.g. roads, railways and power). However,
major reforms have not been achieved for an enabling environment for private sector led growth.
Consequently, the results of this pillar have been rated moderately unsatisfactory.

vi.
In terms of improving the lives and protection of the vulnerable, the second pillar, there has been
progress in some areas such as improved operational efficiency in provision of water in mine townships,
increase in use of condoms (at last sex), increase in number of females 15-49 year olds receiving HIV
tests and percentage of pregnant HIV positive women receiving complete course of ARVs. In education,
the completion rate for grade 7 reached 85% in 2006 (surpassing the CAS target of 80%). The Bank has
supported government efforts by rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure. Further net enrollment
(grades 1-7) rose from 78% in 2002 to 97% in 2006. Quality of education was enhanced through
provision of learning materials and strengthened teacher training in a period of vast expansion in system
coverage. Available data show that learning achievements in English and Mathematics rose between
1999 to 2003.
vii.
The third and final pillar on effectively and efficiently managed public sector realized some gains
on an open and transparent budgeting process. However, performance management and a shift of staff
toward supporting service delivery functions have yet to be accomplished.
viii. In general, institutional development through Bank support has helped to build capacity in a
number of areas such as railways, roads, water and public sector management.

87

ix.

Based on the foregoing, the CAS Completion Report has proposed a rating of Bank support over
the CAS FY04-07 as moderately satisfactory. This is taking into account the fact that actual total lending
achieved was below the envisaged level.

x.

As a result of the experience of CAS FY04-07, a number of lessons are emphasized, notably, (i)
the need to focus on few indicators and monitoring them over the CAS period; (ii) having simplified
project design (something that IEG and QAG have emphasized in the past; (iii) responding quickly to
knowledge gaps through AAA and; (iv) working in partnerships to leverage resources.

88

Introduction
1.
This CAS Completion Report evaluates the effectiveness of the International Development
Association’s Country Assistance Strategy for Zambia approved on March 9, 2004, (Report No. 27654ZA), covering FY 2004-2007.
2.
During this period, Zambia’s economic performance improved and some progress was achieved
in reducing poverty and meeting national development goals. Most notably, Zambia’s external debt was
almost eliminated through the combined impact of Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI); and its export performance was transformed by a tripling of
copper prices and a large increase in copper production. Fiscal performance also improved, partly as a
result of external debt reduction and better terms of trade, but also because of better fiscal discipline.
Structural reforms, however, moved slowly (including putting in place legislation for procurement
reform; commercialization of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation- ZESCO; removing barriers to
exports, investment and production; and liberalization of telecommunications).
3.
The Bank’s engagement with Zambia over the two previous CAS periods, (FY96-00 and 00-03)
had not been successful. Bank performance during both the FY96-01 and the FY00-03 CAS periods had
been deemed unsatisfactory by the IEG Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE). For the FY96-01 period
this assessment was largely because of Zambia’s unsustainable external debt and debt service which led
the Bank to lend at the “high case scenario” in spite of poor country performance. A further reason,
according to the CAE, was the Bank’s delayed and limited response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the
case of the FY00-03 CAS, the development outcome was considered unsatisfactory because progress
toward all CAS objectives fell short of base case expectations and because sustainability was unlikely due
to low client commitment to policy reforms, which had not, changed since the mid-1990s48.
4.
The FY04-07 CAS was therefore conceived as a clear “break with the past”. Basing itself on the
government’s PRSP, it selected three main pillars:
a. sustained economic growth anchored in a diversified and export oriented economy;
b. improving lives and protection of the vulnerable; and
c. supporting an effectively and efficiently managed public sector.
In addition, the CAS piloted a new results framework, as way of changing both client and Bank
expectations and re-focusing them on concrete results on the ground, as opposed to lending amounts and
other inputs. Accordingly, the Bank prepared a results matrix highlighting selected indicators to be
monitored, which was discussed and agreed with the client on the basis of the PRSP (See Annex 4). The
CAS CR has used the CAS indicators agreed at preparation of the CAS in order to assess the impact.
5.
The broad conclusion of this CAS CR is that Bank support to Zambia in FY04-07 contributed to
the achievement of some important concrete results, specifically:
a. improved management of public resources but limited success in enhancing an enabling
environment for private sector led growth;
b. progress in the completion rate for children at grade 7;
c. an increase in the number of females 15-49 years receiving HIV tests; and in the
percentage of pregnant HIV positive women receiving complete course of ARVs; and
d. a more open and transparent budgeting process.

OED CAS Completion Report Review, February 26, 2004.

89

6.
This was accomplished through several instruments, as set out in Section B. As highlighted in the
report, a number of achievements were recorded; however, dialogue with government has yielded low
progress on reforms such as removing constraints to entry of both domestic and foreign investment, and
therefore, achievement of strong private sector led and diversified growth. Nonetheless, given that the
resource envelope available during this period was below envisioned levels and that some operations were
dropped (some due to changed priorities of the government), this Completion Report concludes that the
Bank’s overall performance in FY04-07 was moderately satisfactory.

A.

Longer Term Strategic Goals

7.
Zambia’s main goal in the PRSP (2002-4) and the Transitional National Development Plan
(TNDP, 2002-4)49 was poverty reduction through sustained economic growth and employment
creation”50. The PRSP analysis was that poverty was on the increase in Zambia for the following reasons:
(i) lack of economic growth; (ii) inadequate targeting of the poor and vulnerable; (iii) weak integration of
the poor into the market (especially small scale farmers); (iv) absence of well conceived livelihood
approaches for addressing rural and urban poverty; (v) weak access by the poor to real assets due to
unfavorable land ownership laws and tenure systems; and (vi) weaknesses in economic and political
governance.
8.
The PRSP elaborated the longer-term outcomes needed to achieve economic growth and poverty
reduction as follows: (i) a growth conducive macroeconomic environment; (ii) a diversified and export
oriented economy; (iii) better health and long-term survival, with particular focus on at risk and
vulnerable groups; (iv) better educated populace, with relevant job skills as well as academic training; (v)
greater security for individuals, households and communities; (vi) a more transparent and accountable
public sector and; (vii) a productive and efficient public service.
9.
The country’s longer-term strategic goals have not changed since the CAS FY04-07 was
prepared. In fact, the PRSP was extended to 2006 to allow for sufficient implementation of the PRSP and
adequate time for preparation of the subsequent Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP 2006-2010) and
the Long Term Vision 2030 that would set out the ensuing medium term strategy for Zambia51. Moreover
the FNDP continued and deepened the PRSP focus on growth and poverty reduction through a more
detailed program built around pro-poor growth sectors (rural development, agriculture and
manufacturing) and also creation of linkages between capital-intensive sectors and the rest of the
economy in order to have broad based growth. Further, poverty reduction remained a key social policy
along with the need to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
10.

CAS Objectives. The CAS strategic objectives were a subset of those in the PRSP:
a. sustained economic growth anchored in a diversified and export oriented economy;
b. improving lives and protection of the vulnerable; and
c. an effectively and efficiently managed public sector.
Based on these objectives, the CAS sought to develop a results-based framework, i.e. to specify outcomes
and the instruments for achieving them. The Africa Action Plan, introduced in FY06, emphasized
promoting shared growth, developing in-country institutional capacity and strengthening partnerships
under a results framework, which reinforced the approach being taken for Zambia.

49

The national goal of the TNDP was to achieve “Sustainable Economic Growth, Employment creation and poverty
reduction, TNDP, October, 2002.
50
In May, 2002 the Government approved the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for 2002-2004
51
The FNDP was launched by the President of Zambia on January 17, 2007.

Between 2004 and 200752, Zambia’s GDP grew at an average rate of about 6 percent per annum.
This was significantly better than both the PRSP target of 4 percent and the 2.2 percent annual growth
recorded between 1998 and 2001. Per capita income grew at 2.3 percent during the same period53. The
surge in copper prices and substantially increased copper production contributed to Zambia’s success on
the economic front during the CAS period54. While the rise in copper prices was exogenous, the increase
in copper production was also due to the privatization of the mines and new substantial investment
programs.
12.
Macro economic stability also improved, partly because of exogenous factors, but also through
improved fiscal and monetary management. Single digit inflation was achieved during 2006 for the first
time in thirty years, and was sustained through 2007, though ending the year marginally higher than in
2006. At the end of 2007, the rate of inflation was 8.9 percent compared to 8.2 percent at the end of 2006
and significantly below the 17.5 percent recorded in 2004. Interest rates have also declined. Specifically,
average commercial bank lending rates declined from 37.1 percent at the end of December, 2004 to 33.9
percent in December, 2005 and then by 6- percentage points to 27.9 percent in December, 2006. The

weighted lending base rate stands at 18.3% (end of 2007) signifying a decline of almost 10 percentage
points from end of 2005.55 The exchange rate has largely stabilized, although a substantial appreciation
against the US$ of about 35 percent between January, 2005 and May, 2006 indicated the potential for
“Dutch Disease”. The fiscal deficit declined from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.8 percent in 2005 and
1.3 percent in 2007 though part of the improvement in 2007 was due to a failure to spend the entire
capital budget56.
13.
Zambia reached HIPC completion in April, 2005 following an agreement with the IMF on a
PRGF in June, 2004. Prior to this, Zambia was one of the most heavily indebted countries in the world.
On attainment of HIPC completion, $3.5 billion of the debt was written off. After MDRI, Zambia’s debt
was US $635 million by the end of 2006, compared to about US$7 billion at the end of 2004. Foreign
debt service in 2007 is projected at US $33.9 million or only 9 percent of the pre-HIPC and pre-MDRI
level. The attainment of HIPC completion reflected better economic management by the government of
Zambia. It not only freed up needed resources for economic and social expenditure, but also made
Zambia a more attractive investment destination.
14.
However, while a stable macro economic environment has been largely achieved, measures
aimed at increasing private investment especially in non-traditional sectors are needed both for a
diversified economy, and to reach targeted growth rates in the FNDP. For instance, Doing Business study
for 2008 indicates that procedures for starting a business in Zambia have not yet been streamlined and
Zambia’s ranking has in fact deteriorated between 2007 and 2008. Even though non-traditional exports
grew by almost 40% between 2005 and 2007, indications are that higher rates are attainable.
15.
The overall poverty rate remains high at 68 percent in 2004, though it declined from 73 percent in
199857. Rural poverty stood at 78 percent in 2004, a decline from 83 percent in 1998, while in urban
areas it fell by 3 percent to 53 percent during the same period58. Zambia’s high poverty rates have been in
large part due to slow growth, but the available evidence also suggests a low poverty elasticity of growth,
especially in rural areas.
16.
The HIV and AIDS prevalence rate for 15-49 years age group was estimated at 16 percent in
2002. Maternal mortality continues to be high and actually deteriorated to 729 maternal deaths per
100,000 live births in 2001/2002 from the 1996 level of 649. The MDG status report in 2005, rated
achievement of this goal as unlikely. Infant mortality declined to 110 deaths per 1,000 live births in
2001/2002 from 123 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000. Under-five mortality is also high at 168 deaths
per 1,000 live births in 2001/200259. While Zambia has the potential to achieve the MDGs for under-five
mortality, access to water and sanitation, extreme poverty and reversing incidence of malaria and other
diseases; concerted effort is required in order to make these a reality60. Thus the CAS objective of
improving and protecting the lives of the vulnerable remains a key priority.

55

The weighted lending base rate was 27.6% at the end of 2005 and 21.6% in 2006.
According to the Budget released on January 25, 08—fiscal deficit for 2008 is estimated at 3.2% of GDP.
57
According to some analysts, 5 percent reduction in poverty at Zambia’s growth rate is considered average
performance.
58
According to Living Conditions Monitoring Survey released in February, 2008, the national poverty rate is
estimated at 64% in 2006. Rural poverty has increased to 80% while urban poverty shows a decline to 34%.

The CAS objective of a more transparent public sector is being achieved through supporting a
better information management system, a more predictable budgeting process and enhancing oversight
activities of the auditor general. Whereas there was extensive preparatory work (such as carrying out a
baseline assessment of the public expenditure and financial accountability which indicated existing poor
systems for the budget cycle), implementation has been slow and therefore, achieving an accountable and
a more productive public sector requires more effort.
18.
The Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Zambia in 2003 was 3.35 and
3.4 in 2006. Preliminary estimate for 2007 is 3.5. According to this indicator, Zambia has continued to
be only a medium performer, but is improving.

B.

Evaluating CAS Outcomes

19.
This section of the CCR evaluates the outcomes that were achieved over the CAS period (FY0407) under the three CAS priorities outlined above, (paragraph 10). The 2004 CAS selected a number of
indicators for those CAS outcomes that were expected to be influenced by the Bank’s interventions62.
QAG considered that the results based CAS had effectively mapped the objectives of individual projects,
AAA and other Bank outputs to the overarching goals of the CAS63. The relevant lending and nonlending services for this period are in Annex 2 and 3.
I. Strategic priority one: Sustained economic growth anchored in a diversified and export oriented
economy;
20.
This “pillar” sought to support a growth conducive macroeconomic environment and a diversified
and export oriented economy. Specifically, the CAS outcomes selected were: (i) improved management
of public resources; and (ii) an enabling environment for private sector led growth.
21.
Improved management of public resources. The major instruments deployed by the Bank to
support this outcome were the EMGCI, PSCAP and key diagnostic studies, notably, PEMFAR and the
CEM. An IEG evaluation of PSCAP gave a moderately satisfactory rating64. The design was considered
overambitious especially taking into account lack of commitment by the government and the fact that
public administration reforms require a longer time for implementation than was anticipated and most
components were only partially achieved. Further, the IFMIS was not carried out and government instead
upgraded the existing FMS and thereby succeeded in producing more accurate and timely monthly
expenditure returns65. Other benefits of the project included capacity building at the Office of the Auditor
General; introduction of an activity based budgeting (ABB) under the Medium Expenditure Framework
(MTEF); and the Payroll Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system (funded by DFID).
IEG considered the institutional development impact as modest but likely to be sustainable.
22.
In addition, PEMFAR, a core diagnostic review completed in November, 2003 led to the
introduction of a comprehensive reform, the government’s Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Program (PEMFA) supported by a consortium of cooperating partners including DfID, the
EC, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden66.
23.
The CEM highlighted Zambia’s prospects for growth and poverty reduction including ways to
achieve policy reform and diversification. Several participants in discussions of the study provided input
into the PRSP and helped shape the growth pillar of the CAS, despite being completed some time after
the original mission67.
24.
EMGC I delivered in FY05 as part of the first of two structural operations in the CAS base
lending scenario was aimed at correcting macro-imbalances, improving financial sector performance,
enhancing public sector management and improving business environment. By reinforcing government’s
own commitment to moving these reforms forward, it contributed to the improvement in the

94

macroeconomic framework for growth, as shown by such indicators as real growth, the decline in the
current account deficit and vibrant non-traditional exports. Further, there was a reduction in domestic
arrears from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.7 % of GDP in 200768. Another achievement was helping
the public service pensions fund achieve a stronger financial footing69. Efforts were less successful on
strengthening the role of the financial sector and there was also a delay in selling a majority share in the
Zambia National Commercial Bank to a private bank due to strong political opposition both within and
outside government, and inability to find a suitable buyer70. The outcome was unsatisfactory partly due to
the use of an inappropriate instrument. Specifically, use of a one-year adjustment loan to achieve difficult
and far-reaching objectives did not adequately recognize the long-term nature of the reforms. While IEG
recognized the support towards strengthening the macroeconomic environment as having substantial
impact, it observed that the contribution to an improved business environment through EMGCI was
negligible.71 One lesson learned, therefore, is that institutional measures require long-term intensive
engagement rather than through a one-year adjustment loan.
25.
Enabling environment for private sector led growth. This was expected to be achieved through:
(i) reducing administrative barriers to exports, investment and production; (ii) improving financial
management and sustainability of infrastructure services with an increase in private investment for service
provision; (iii) meeting the needs of the formal and informal sectors of the economy with the graduates of
the TEVET system; and (iv) ensuring compliance of the mining sector to environmental regulations.
26.
Reduced administrative barriers to exports, investment and production. At the time of the FY04
CAS, the main constraints appeared to be macro-economic instability, regulatory policy uncertainty and
poor administration, inefficient labor and infrastructure markets and corruption72. An important
component of the CAS was an Investment Climate Assessment done in FY04, which identified the
priority constraints to productivity, investment and exports. The main instrument for addressing these
constraints initially was the Economic Recovery and Investment Promotion Technical Assistance project
(ERIPTA). This operation was initially aimed at providing technical assistance for privatization (ZCCM
and ZPA) and was scheduled to close on September 30, 2001. However, it was initially extended for ten
months and was then augmented by two supplemental credits with a new closing date of September 30,
2005 (four years later than original closing and therefore, falling into the CAS FY04-07 period). In early
2002, the Anglo-American Corporation decided to pull out of the Zambian mining industry, potentially as
serious blow to the mines privatization strategy. The government then used ERIPTA to set up a team to
restructure ZCCM and also to find a new a partner.73 The lack of transparency in privatization of ZCCM
was seen as contributing to an erosion of public support for privatization, which in turn undermined
government’s own commitment. IEG concluded that achievement of outcomes through ERIPTA was
moderately unsatisfactory and recommended that, in future; greater account should be taken of the
political economy of reform.74
27.
The PSD reform program was arrived at through consultation between government and the
private sector developing a shared list of priority reforms75. A new institutional infrastructure was
established, including a PSD Reform Steering Committee and PSD Reform Working Groups, each led by
a representative of the private sector. These were in turn supported by a MoU between Cooperating
Partners establishing a basket fund to support PSD reforms. The ERIPTA supplemental credit supported
the preparation and implementation of the PSD reform program being the most relevant instrument
available to the Bank at the time to support the PSD reform program. The need for PSD reform became
even more urgent following the Anglo-American pull out and the need to strengthen efforts to diversify
Zambia’s economy.
28.
In terms of impact, of the three reforms targeted by the PSD program during this period, only one
has been implemented (reduction of retrenchment costs that were exorbitantly high).76 While the transfer
of knowledge has been achieved at the technical level and commitment to the other reforms (e.g.

95

liberalizing telecommunications and reducing administrative barriers), follow through has been absent,
and in the case of telecommunications, GRZ has now reversed their former commitment to undertake the
reforms. The experience with PSD reforms illustrates the importance of gauging political commitment to
reform, beyond statements and could also include mapping the “winners” and “losers”, so as to maximize
the likelihood of implementation.
29.
The SEED project was to have been an important part of the diversification strategy conceived
after the Anglo-American pullout. However, its design was overambitious, and government ownership at
the level of its individual sectoral components was low. As a result, implementation was unsatisfactory,
and it was classified as a problem project soon after effectiveness in 2004. Its restructuring was
concluded only during 200777. The project was also extended for a two-year period to November 30,
2011 to facilitate the achievement of the PDO. Consequently, the impact of this restructuring and
extension can only be adequately assessed in the subsequent CAS period (FY08-11). The Regional Trade
Facilitation Project has been slow in disbursing due to the low level of marketing, resulting in a low level
of demand from Zambia. The Bank is brokering an arrangement in which USAID and the EU will fund a
Zambian based underwriter for the African Trade Insurance program (restructured Regional Trade
Facilitation Project), which will result in more effective marketing and, most probably, more Zambian
transactions.
30.
Improved financial management and sustainability of infrastructure services with an increase in
private investment for service provision. The CAS envisaged the main interventions in infrastructure
being in roads, railways and the power sector. In the roads sector, there has been some improvement:
paved roads in good condition are estimated at 65 percent compared to 58 percent in 2004. ROADSIP – a
combined effort by the Bank and several donors notably, the EU - has been a major instrument in
achieving this outcome.
31.
The Bank supported the railways through the Zambia Railways Restructuring Project. However,
there was no indicator in the CAS reflecting the contribution of rail. The project objectives included an
increase in operating efficiency, reduction in cost of operations, having competitive freight services and
tariffs (as well as increasing the railway’s share of local, international and transit freight traffic). To
achieve these objectives, Zambia Railways was concessioned, albeit later than expected. To increase
operating efficiency, locomotives were overhauled, wagons were repaired and part of the track was relaid. To reduce the cost of operations, ZRL was restructured and labor force reduced to a number
appropriate to manage the concession. However, there has been no data to show the level of freight
traffic and there are indications that there has been a switch to road traffic. While IEG observed that the
achievement of outcomes under this project had been satisfactory and that there was substantial
institutional development, they also stated that sustainability had to be carefully re-assessed two years
after project closing.78 In any event, there is now government and consumer dissatisfaction with the
concessionaire’s performance, a situation that may require Bank support in order to ensure that
performance of the rail system is adequately addressed. At stake is not only the performance of the rail
system itself, but government and public confidence in the efficacy of private concessions and solutions
in other sectors, also.
32.
In the power sector, the Power Rehabilitation Project that closed in FY06 contributed to
rehabilitation of several hydropower stations and increased the number of household connections. The
ICR rated all the hydropower rehabilitation components of Bank support through this project as
satisfactory. The EMGCI also supported policy reforms related to commercialization and viability of the
sector. However, the Increased Access to Electricity Project was not delivered during the CAS period.

96

33.
In addition, the three stages of the commercialization roadmap of ZESCO were completed as a
condition for reaching HIPC completion point. Originally the HIPC condition relating to this sector
provided for the privatization of ZESCO, but the government balked at this, and opted for
commercialization instead. The roadmap actions, which were designed by government, focused primarily
on governance issues essential for the beginning of actual commercialization. The commercialization
roadmap actions in the Entry and Interim Phases were successfully completed by government, ZESCO
and Energy Regulation Board, and the relevant HIPC triggers, therefore, were met. However,
implementation of ZESCO’s commercialization roadmap has been uneven, and while the company has
shown improvements in some areas - electricity loss reduction, metering, billing and collection, reduction
in arrears, service extension, these have not translated into consistent improvement in the bottom-line
financial performance. The formal evaluation of the commercialization is yet to be done by the Bank and
government. However, the power crisis in Zambia, evidenced by major load shedding and a total system
collapse for a short period in early 2008, suggests that the strategy will need a major re-think.
34.
Meeting the needs of the formal and informal sectors of the economy with the graduates of the
TEVET system through the TEVET operation. Having adequate skill levels for both prospective formal
sector employees and self-employees was considered to be critical to ensuring the growth of the private
sector, but also to ensuring a much wider spread in the benefits of such growth. A tracer study showed
that 95.4 percent of employers surveyed perceived the training to be relevant and 95.9 percent thought the
training to be of quality. Moreover, the TEVET ISR shows that 73 percent of graduates surveyed in the
tracer study found employment within six months of graduation (target was 70 percent). However, there
is actually no CAS progress indicator on satisfaction with TEVET graduates. Another indicator,
increasing graduates from poor and socially disadvantaged groups (with an increase of at least 25 percent
being female) cannot be determined at the moment and bursaries were offered only from 2006. This
impact will also be clearly determined in the oncoming CAS period as this project was extended for
another two years. At this point, however, the outcome of this intervention appears positive although
future financing has not been settled.
35.
Compliance of mining sector to environment regulations. Environmental damage in the mining
areas is extensive. Thus a major concern at the time of mine privatization was that, in addition to
environmental clean up; future environmental damage would be avoided. For the Copperbelt, this was
expected to be achieved by a reduction of pollution flow from rehabilitated project sites into the Kafue
river watershed by about 70 percent by 2007. A monitoring system was established in 2005 and the target
only expected to be measured in FY09 when the project is due to close. Unfortunately, a major spillage
of effluent into the Kafue River during 2007 has undermined public confidence in the efficacy of
environmental controls, even though this is partly due to legacy factors. Efforts to enhance monitoring of
pollution flows and loads resulting from mining operations are ongoing but have yet to be completed79.
36.
Overall performance of Strategic priority one. Based on the CAS outcomes that the Bank
expected to influence, as highlighted above (and in the annex ) the results are mixed. On the one hand, the
Bank helped reinforce progress towards macro economic stability, which in turn helped stimulate
economic growth. Efforts aimed at provision of infrastructure services have achieved some progress, but
fall well short of what is required going forward. However, dialogue with government on reforms have
yet to lead to desired outcomes such as removing constraints to entry of both domestic and foreign
investment, and therefore, achievement of strong private sector led and diversified growth.
37.
Consequently, the CAS completion report concludes that performance of this pillar is moderately
unsatisfactory.

97

II. Strategic priority two: Improving lives and protection of the vulnerable.
38.
The second pillar of the CAS sought to contribute to better health and long-term survival, with
particular focus on at risk and vulnerable groups; a better educated populace, with relevant job skills as
well as academic training and greater security for individuals, households and communities. The
outcomes envisaged were: (i) efficient use of financial and human resources in the health sector; (ii)
reliable and sustainable provision of water in areas of Bank support; (iii) vulnerable groups in
communities targeted by Bank support change risky behavior; (iv) vulnerable populations impacted by
HIV/AIDS use prevention, care and mitigation services; (v) improved quality of the primary education
system; and (vi) poor households and communities in areas vulnerable to frequent droughts benefit from
risk management mechanisms (which are available in a sustainable manner)80.
39.
Improved efficiency in the use of financial and human resources in the health sector. Bank
contribution to this outcome was expected through a Health Public Expenditure review (PER) that was
only delivered in FY07 (instead of FY06). Despite the delay in delivery, the Government has began to
implement most of the recommendations in the 2008 annual work plan. Further, the Netherlands
government has supported a retention scheme which has helped to reduce the rural/urban imbalance in
remuneration and has improved the availability of medical doctors in rural areas. The retention scheme
has now been expanded by government to include frontline health workers in rural areas and hard to reach
areas. Further, construction of staff houses by ZAMSIF in rural areas contributed to retention of workers
(by December 2005, 220 new staff houses were constructed and 55 rehabilitated in various part of the
country and skewed towards rural areas).
40.
Reliable and sustainable provision of water in areas of Bank support. As a result of Bank
support through MTSP, a private sector operator was introduced to manage the water supply and
sewerage systems under a 5-year management contract81. This arrangement resulted in an increase in
revenues that covered 90 percent of operations and maintenance costs and a higher level of operational
efficiency- - for example, water losses were reduced to 26.4 percent (target 30 percent). Further,
reliability of water supply increased from 13.5 hours a day to 17 hours (target 20 hours) with solid waste
collection almost 100 percent. IEG rated achievement of the outcome of MTSP as satisfactory.
41.
The Zambia Social Investment Fund (ZAMSIF) was a Bank-supported program aimed broadly at
delivering quality rural infrastructure through community-based initiatives, supported by a program to
strengthen local authorities. It included components aimed at increasing the consumption of safe water in
rural and urban areas82. The planned impact evaluation of ZAMSIF has just been completed at the time of
this CAS CR and the final ICR expected in FY 08. However, based on the draft ICR, water and sanitation
was the third most popular choice by communities (after education and health) and consisted of 11
percent of the total projects supported over the five-year period of the project. About 33 percent of these
were carried out during the two years of the CAS period (2004-2005)83. According to a survey carried
out by the government, 57 percent of households had access to safe water supply in 2004 compared to 56
percent in 1994 reflecting a slight improvement.
42.
Vulnerable groups in communities targeted have changed risky behavior. Outcome indicators
selected in the CAS show that the percentage of 15-49 year olds receiving HIV tests was 8.5 percent and
7.9 percent for males and females, respectively in 2003. In 2005, the percentage of females receiving the
HIV test went up to 9.2 percent while that of males actually went down to 7.2 percent. Reported condom
use at last sex with non-regular partner by males has gone up from 30 percent in 2001 to 41 percent in
2005 and for females, from 17 percent to 29 percent84. Bank support through ZAMSIF and ZANARA
made a contribution through training of counselors, peer educators, PMTCT/ART/STI providers, and
refurbishment of VCT/Youth Friendly Centers in health facilities, including procurement of laboratory
equipment. In particular, ZANARA refurbished and established 14 percent of the total VCT centers in

98

the country. Further, through this support, all VCT and PMTCT centers in Zambia were supplied with
test kits or reagents from ZANARA. This has enabled the government to institutionalize routine HIV
testing for all women attending antenatal clinics. Consequently, the percentage of pregnant HIV+ women
receiving a complete course of ARV increased from 39 percent in 2003 to 70 percent in 2005.
43.
A component of the Basic Education Sector Project (BESSIP) helped develop a strategy to
integrate HIV/AIDS into School Health and Nutrition interventions. At ICR, it was observed that one of
the achievements of BESSIP was that many schools now conduct regular HIV/AIDS talks and other
health issues at assembly.
44.
Another CAS indicator, the ratio of orphaned to non-orphaned children 10-14 years currently
attending school in communities targeted by Bank support cannot be accurately assessed due to
inadequate data, but the indications are positive. For instance, about 2.4 percent of community subprojects
supported by ZAMSIF were on HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups and 3,034 OVCs were estimated to
have been directly assisted85.
45.
The Strategic Gender Assessment was carried out in June, 2004 in order to influence the CAS
FY04-07, and in particular gender issues in HIV/AIDS and the vulnerable, however, it not clear how the
report was utilized, even though Bank support through ZANARA, ZAMSIF and BESSIP exhibited
elements of gender in their activities86.
46.
Improved quality of the primary education system. A key indicator is the completion rate for
Grade 7. This was 64 percent in 2001 and reached 85 percent in 2006, surpassing the CAS target of 80
percent. Bank support to this achievement was mainly through construction and rehabilitation of basic
schools through support from BESSIP and ZAMSIF. The investment under BESSIP ensured that there
were increased school places to accommodate enrollment expansion. From 2001-2005, this IDA credit
financed the construction of 2,924 new classrooms and 1,945 teachers' houses, and the rehabilitation of
2,992 classrooms and 1,366 teachers' houses. IDA funding contributed to 65 percent of the total
classrooms and teachers' houses constructed and rehabilitated under BESSIP. About 33 percent of the
construction took place in urban areas and 67 percent in rural areas. From 2002 to 2006, the gross
enrollment rate of Grade 1-7 increased from 94 percent to 123 percent, representing nearly 10 percent
annual growth and also surpassing the target87. The net enrollment rate increased from 78 percent to 97
percent during the same period88. Investments through ZAMSIF resulted in construction of 748
classrooms to accommodate 52, 435 additional pupils, also contributing to the increase in enrollment.
The increase in enrollment was seen by IEG as being substantial on account of construction and
rehabilitation programs (even though elimination of school fees by the government in 2002 was also seen
as a crucial factor).
47.
In addition, the increased provision of learning materials, strengthened teacher training, and other
investments in key education inputs to maintain and further improve teaching and learning quality
ensured that the vast expansion of basic education coverage was not at the cost of education
quality. According to the National Assessment Survey Report 2003, both English and Mathematics
scores improved from 33 percent to 34 percent and from 34 percent to 38 percent respectively, from 1999
to 200389. Although these improvements appear to be marginal (IEG rated improvements on learning
achievement as negligible), account should be take of the fact that this occurred at the same time as a vast
expansion of the system coverage, giving rise to acute pressure on the quality of the system. From 2000
to 2006, IDA funds provided more than six million textbooks and teacher guides. The 2003 National
Assessment Survey indicated that hardly any pupils (0.1 percent) had no access to English and
mathematics textbooks by 2003, comparing with 3.4 percent and 14.7 percent respectively, in 2001.

99

48.
Poor households and communities in areas vulnerable to frequent droughts benefit from risk
management mechanisms (which are available on a sustainable manner)90. The Bank supported the
government through the Emergency Drought Rehabilitation Project (EDRP) to respond effectively to the
2001/02 drought through drought mitigation measures such as providing drinking water, improving
critical transport and logistical links, supporting health and sanitation services; providing support to keep
children in school; and protecting the threatened livestock population. Measures of success included the
number of small-scale farmers using input packs for sustainable farming practices that showed that 64%
of the targeted farmers had been reached. Food production in drought prone areas also rose by 23% from
486,775 tones in 2003 to 599, 731 tones in 2004.
49.
At completion of the project, in 2005, about 95 percent of targeted beneficiaries participated in
the public works program which provided cash for labor, thereby allowing for purchase of food and other
necessities. Roads were built or improved (twice the target of 1400 Kms), although a bridge building
subcomponent was not completed due to procurement delays and poor planning. Even though 64% of
farming households were supported over one agricultural season (target was 120,000), it was observed
that not many were restored to self-sufficiency, as was hoped. IEG rated achievement of outcomes under
EDRP as satisfactory.
50.
Overall performance of Strategic priority two. In education, the Bank contributed to the
increase in completion rate for Grade 7 and gross enrollment rate of Grade 1-7. The quality of education
can be seen to have been influenced through increased provision of educational materials and
strengthened teacher training. However, the weak capacity of MoE led to implementation delays and
inability to measure some targets until after three years into the project. On HIV and AIDS, Bank support
contributed to an increase in number of females receiving an HIV test and percentage of pregnant HIV+
women receiving a complete course of ARVs. Other outcomes that the Bank achieved included
consistent water supply on the Copperbelt and a contribution to an increase, albeit marginal, to access to
safe water national wide. There was also increased production in drought prone areas.
51.

Performance of this pillar is rated moderately satisfactory.

III. Strategic priority three: Effectively and efficiently managed public sector.

52.
The third and final pillar of the CAS was aimed at supporting a more transparent and
accountable public sector and a productive and efficient public service. The CAS outcomes were
that: (i) government executes an open and transparent, timely and realistic budgeting process
with lower levels of financial waste; and (ii) the environment is strengthened for improved
performance by the civil service.
53.
Government executes an open and transparent, timely and realistic budgeting process with lower
levels of financial waste. A CAS outcome indicator was that the deviation between planned and actual
expenditures should not be greater than 10 percent in FY06/07 budget and a number of actions to support
this were undertaken through PSCAP, (see above, paragraph 21). Unrealistic design and delays in
implementation led to an extension of this project by 18 months. One component of the project, on the
financial management, accountability and transparency only partially achieved its objectives91.
54.
Even though the design study was completed for the Internal Finance Management Information
systems (IFMIS), this subcomponent of the project was not introduced and the government opted to
upgrade the Financial Management System (FMS)92. With this background, IEG rated achievement of
outcomes under PSCAP as only moderately satisfactory. (See Table 3). As discussed earlier, EMGCI
also reinforced policy changes aimed at enhancing public sector management. Likewise, the Public

100

Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) provided the analytical
underpinnings to a harmonized approach to public sector reform including the Bank-supported Public
Service Management Program Support Project that was only approved in January, 2006.
Decentralization, the fifth component under PSCAP, failed to realize restructuring and improved
accountability in the public service. However, a draft National Decentralization Policy was prepared and
later approved in November, 2005. In addition, support to decentralization planned as high case lending
was not delivered in FY0793.
55.
A more transparent and effective public procurement system was expected to be carried out
through transforming the Zambia National Tender Board into an effective and transparent regulatory and
oversight body for government procurement. This is being done through the Public Sector Management
Support Program (SWAp) that includes support from the Bank through the Public Sector Management
Support Program- Support Project (PSMP-SP). Implementation progress is behind schedule because new
procurement legislation has not been enacted in order to set the framework for the necessary reforms.
56.
Environment is strengthened for improved performance by the civil service. Consolidation of
allowances into the base salary for the civil service was partially met because the Medium Term Pay
Reform Strategy (MTPRS) was put on hold due to inadequate resources. For the same reason,
performance pay for management staff was not done. This was expected mainly through the Public
Sector Management Support Program (SWAp) for which Bank support has only become operational for
the last year of the CAS. A governance baseline study was prepared early in the CAS giving perceptions
on corruption but support to decentralization has not been delivered during this CAS due to uncertainty
by government on areas requiring support from developments partners (including the Bank). The shift of
staff composition toward support of service delivery functions such as teacher/pupil ratio (education),
physician/ population ratio (health) continue to be poor. This shows that there is some way to go before
improved performance in the civil service is strengthened.
57.
Overall performance of Strategic priority three. Several indicators for measuring this outcome
were changed during implementation and therefore, the original indicators were not all monitored.
However, the government introduced an activity-based budget (ABB), a medium term expenditure
framework (MTEF) now in its third year and also upgraded the Financial Management System. These
achievements also contributed to Strategic Objective One. Unfortunately, measures aimed at improving
service delivery through performance management and a shift of staff towards service delivery functions
have not been addressed vigorously.
58.

Performance of this pillar is therefore, rated moderately unsatisfactory.

59.
Monitoring CAS outcomes. As indicated in the introduction, above, Zambia was an early pilot
for a results-based CAS. Consequently, a framework was prepared at the beginning of the CAS.
However, an M and E plan was not developed at the beginning of the CAS to allow for effective
monitoring of the CAS results. In part this was due to the fact that a large number of indicators were
selected to measure the outcomes of the CAS, and that some of these indicators were not consistent with
project indicators. During implementation, an attempt was made to fine-tune these indicators (as shown in
the results’ matrix in the annex). As a result, several indicators selected were later revised, and made more
focused or dropped altogether pointing to the lack of clarity and complexity of the indicators selected at
the beginning of the CAS. This has contributed to the difficulty in assessing outcomes of the CAS and a
decision was taken to use original indicators.
60.
A study of M and E of the Zambia portfolio pointed to some weaknesses, e.g. lack of realism in
indicators, lack of baseline data, lack of clearly defined institutional arrangements for measuring and
tracking indicators. In addition, government’s capacity to measure sector and project level outcomes is

101

weak, despite some effort to introduce a monitoring system for the PRSP, and now the FNDP.
Contributing to building the national M and E capacity should be a priority94.
61.
Other CAS Outcomes. The Bank has been working with government on the intergovernmental
fiscal architecture (IFA) aimed at introducing district restructuring, recurrent and capital grants. When
implemented, this will contribute to better service delivery by local authorities. In 2006, the Bank and the
IMF provided quick-response technical assistance to the government on the fiscal regime for the mining
sector, given the large change in the fortunes of the mining sector. Based in large part on this advice, the
government has recently introduced a new fiscal regime for the mining sector, through it remains unclear
how it will be introduced given the legal status of the existing development agreements with the mining
companies. Bank support through the ZANARA Project through in-service training, contributed in
improving skills in management and mitigating the impact of HIV and AIDS in health facilities and at
community level. In addition, ZAMSIF contributed to the construction and rehabilitation of health
facilities across the country which resulted in an increase in utilization of health services as shown by the
increase in trends in national antenatal and under five attendance outcomes from 2000-2005. Through the
Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA), the Bank contributed to the dialogue on the need to
mainstream social protection in the FNDP leading to formation of a Sector Advisory Group, supported by
a group of donors, which prepared a social protection strategy for the FNDP. This was also in line with
QAG’s recommendation that the Bank pays more attention to safety nets for the vulnerable.

C.

Measuring Bank Performance

62.
Quality of products and services. In assessing the CAS FY99-03, OED recommended, inter
alia, (i) strengthening project design and supervision efforts due to country’s weak institutional capacity;
(ii) a more selective use of adjustment lending and (iii) not to lend beyond a minimal program unless
there was measurable and concrete reforms undertaken. OED also observed that borrower ownership of
the program was low; that counterpart funds were insufficient and that project management was poor. To
some extent, these issues improved during the FY04-07. As already noted, there were several operations
which were implemented well, with satisfactory borrower ownership. Counterpart funding was slow in a
number of cases but was partially met with funding from other donors (e.g. Road sector) and also through
100 percent IDA financing of some projects95.
63.
Overall project performance deteriorated at the beginning of the CAS period, but then improved
after an intensive effort by the government and the Bank. Six projects were deemed at risk, representing
50 percent of the portfolio at the end of FY05. This deterioration was mainly on account of project
management, procurement, counterpart funding, M and E, legal covenants and safeguards issues.
Consequently, QAG placed Zambia on a Portfolio Improvement Plan (PIP) for FY06 in order to address
the declining portfolio performance that would have a negative impact IDA allocations. This was the
most challenging period of the FY04-07 CAS. However, a number of measures were undertaken between
the Zambia CT and the government including: (i) following a portfolio improvement plan comprising of
action plans for each project at risk; and (ii) continuation of proactive actions taken by the ZCT in FY04
and FY05 ); (iii) having a mini CPR by the end of December, 2005. Intensive supervision of projects at
risk was done with resources provided from the Regional Escrow Account. These efforts yielded results,
so that by the end of January 2007, there was only one problem project (that had also reached an
advanced stage in its restructuring process). This project remained in problem status as of January 31,
2008 having been restructured mid-2007.

102

64.
Portfolio Assessments. The CAS envisaged the following lending scenarios: (i) a low case
scenario of US$180-240 million for FY04-07 (or US$45-50 million per annum for one or two operations
aimed at safeguarding the poor and also building on implementation success); (ii) a base case scenario of
US$280-320 million (or US$70-90 million per annum); and (iii) a high case of US$360-420 million (or
US$90-105 million per annum including a PRSC for education and health). Lending of US$255 million
was actually delivered, below the base case scenario envisaged at the beginning of the CAS. However, it
should also be noted that the scenarios of the CAS were only relevant for FY04-05 and in FY06, under
IDA 14, allocations were determined annually instead of using CAS scenarios. In addition, a number of
projects were cancelled on account of changed government priorities, notably, the Education and Health
sector SWAps planned for FY06 high case and the Global Development Learning Network (FY05 base
case). The HIV and /AIDS Corridor (sub regional project, FY07 low case) was transferred to the regional
department. The Increased Access to Electricity Project (FY 06 base case) was moved to FY08 as a result
of reduced IDA allocation to Zambia-- post HIPC and MDRI. However, at the CPR in 2005, two more
projects were added that were not originally in the CAS, namely, the Malaria Booster Program and also

the Essential Bridges Rehabilitation Program also in line with government’s changed priorities97.
On the whole, the Zambia portfolio shows a decline over the CAS period as reflected by total net
commitments (from US$605million in FY04 to about US$300 million in FY07).
66.
The disbursement ratio during the CAS period was about 30% and reached its highest level in
FY05 (41%). The average cost of supervision during the CAS period was US$108,250 per project, above
the Africa average of US$98,000. The average cost of preparation was US$520,000, substantially higher

103

than the regional average of about US$308,000 and suggests that the operations being prepared could be
excessively complex and taking too long to prepare.
67.
About ten projects with total net commitments of over US$400 million closed during the CAS
period, 90 percent of these, between March 31–December 31, 200598. Eight projects were extended, two
of them for a period of four years (ERIPTA and BESSIP). The average implementation period was
therefore, about 4 years for FY 04-05 and about three years for 2005-699. The extensions signify the need
to pay attention to design and capacity issues that have contributed to delays in implementation. It should
be pointed out that Bank performance was regarded by IEG as satisfactory in 5 out of 9 projects evaluated
(53 percent on total net commitments of all evaluated projects excluding the Environmental Support
Project that was suspended before the CAS FY04). Performance by the Bank was unsatisfactory in three
projects or 37 percent total net commitments evaluated.
68.
According to the ICRs, all but one of the projects (Power Rehab) that closed achieved satisfactory
outcomes and were likely to be sustainable. Institutional development impact was modest, for most part
(with Zambia Railways Restructuring and Road Sector Investment Program achieving substantial impact).
Of nine projects reviewed by IEG between FY04 and 07, 33 percent were rated likely to be sustained
(ERIPTA was rated unlikely while the rest could not be evaluated)100. For five closed projects, IEG
confirmed achievement of satisfactory outcomes in all cases (representing 53 percent of total net
commitments of all evaluated projects) and in one other case downgraded the ICR rating to moderately
successful. Three projects had unsatisfactory outcomes. Based on these results, it can be stated that Bank
support has led to some satisfactory outcomes and also helped to build capacity in Zambia over the CAS
period.
69.
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). To support policy dialogue, the AAA program for
the CAS period under the low case scenario was delivered almost as planned and during FY04. Only one
ESW was dropped and three were added. Deliverables for FY05 and 06 were also met. Studies for FY07
have draft reports being finalized. Of the AAA program, the PEMFAR had the highest impact resulting
in a joint program with other cooperating partners and also a good example of working under
harmonization101.
70.
In 2004, QAG undertook a review of AAA delivered between FY02 and 05. Six of these
deliverables were in FY04 and 05. On the whole, the Zambia AAA program was rated moderately
unsatisfactory. Strategic relevance was found to be moderately satisfactory and internal quality was
satisfactory. But all other aspects were moderately unsatisfactory including likely impact, participation,
consultation and dissemination. The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), a core diagnostic was
rated satisfactory on account of participation, consultation and dissemination and the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS), best practice as a very short non-technical executive summary that can be
easily read even by busy government officials102. However, the QAG panel saw no evidence of change in
government policy on account due to the CEM and other core diagnostics (e.g. the PVA). The results of
review suggest that the program on AAA in Zambia should be strengthened in order to have a higher
impact. Some of the recommendations include responding to the client through demand driven or “just in
time” studies that are participatory in nature for both short and long-term issues; more attention to
dissemination and client involvement in design. However, demand driven studies would imply having a
flexible AAA budget to use for this purpose.
71.
Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination. Over the CAS period, the Bank’s dialogue with
government has intensified, for instance, through annual Country Program Reviews held between FY04
and 07 and other fora. The main objectives of these CPRs have been to evaluate progress of ongoing
operations, share experience, identify cross cutting problem areas, formulate solutions and bring these to

104

the attention of policy makers. The portfolio improvement plan (PIP) also provided an opportunity for
continuous dialogue with the government that has an interest in having an increased IDA allocation
72.
There were consultations with the stakeholders during preparation of the CAS and a client survey
carried out in 2003 provided input. Some of the suggestions from clients such as having decentralized
decision-making (empowerment) of the Bank’s Zambia Country Office were taken on board by having
senior internationally recruited staff in order to enhance dialogue with clients and other partners. For the
ensuing CAS, consultations should include a discussion on some indicators of progress regarding Bank
support that would form the basis for continued dialogue over the CAS implementation. An example is
dialogue around enhancing the CPIA rating for Zambia.
73.
During the CAS period, in 2004, the Bank joined the Wider Harmonization in Practice Initiative
through a MoU agreed among the government and eleven CPs covering a wide range of harmonization
issues. By 2007, after a lengthy process of dialogue, the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia (JASZ)
was agreed, with a clear division of labor among CPs103. As a result of the division of labor, the Bank
became the co-lead CP in agriculture, private sector development and tourism, energy and
macroeconomics and a background partner in the education sector and subsequently, in social protection.
However, challenges still remain on whether (and how) the Bank will be able to effectively work in a
harmonized environment. One of these challenges is the issue of strategic staffing in view of the budget
and in some cases, how to work more intensively with other CPs without losing the technical strength
available from Bank headquarters, and how to develop and maintain a strong country office. The Bank’s
role in overall donor coordination will change, especially since the traditional consultative group (CG),
which has not been held in Zambia since 2002, has already effectively disappeared. Another challenge is
how to maintain policy dialogue in the social sectors without any lending. The Bank and other
development partners are monitoring the Paris Declaration indicators for aid effectiveness. Current
analysis suggested that more progress is required, for instance, for effective coordination in capacity
development, supervision missions and analytic work.
D.

Lessons learned for subsequent CAS design

74.
Align CAS to only selected strategic objectives. Even though the previous CAS was more
selective than before, and was aligned to the country’s longer-term goals in the PRSP, it lacked sufficient
strategic focus, resulting in some lower priority activities and most likely, less cost effectiveness. The new
CAS should, therefore, be more selective and identify areas were the Bank has a comparative advantage
and where there are strong prospects to add value.
75.
Focus CAS on areas where the government has strong commitment, as revealed by more
political economy analysis. The previous CAS review indicated the importance of strong borrower
ownership at the project level, and this is equally true for the CAS FY04. Based on the performance of
this CAS, it would seem prudent to focus on those reforms that can be implemented even if this means
focusing on reforms that are less ambitious in scope and/or impact. The slow progress on many private
and public sector reforms indicates that even when the stated commitment is there, implementation is
often ineffective. This illustrates the importance of selecting or “vetting” goals – whether of the CAS or
of specific projects - to ensure that they are viable. As noted earlier, IEG has observed that more serious
political economy analysis would have led to different approaches in several instances.
76.
Focus on few monitorable indicators and measure them. The previous CAS set out too many
results, with the implication that the Bank was potentially spread too thin and not able to capture its key
aims within the results framework. This made it necessary to revise the results’ framework during
implementation, though this was not confirmed through a formal progress report. Indicators selected in
the new CAS should be focused, clear and measurable taking into account the country’s capacity. There
must be an M and E plan with consistent sources of data and clear links between Bank support and the

105

FNDP. Baseline data must utilize official data, where available, to ensure that national systems are
strengthened, to promote a focus on agreed goals and avoid duplication of effort. Further, results should
be assessed continuously, and if possible, there must be dedicated persons to do this. Needless to say that
capacity development for measurement of results by the government remains of utmost importance.
77.
Ensure effective choice of lending instruments. The use of a one-year DPL to support
institutional measures that require long-term intensive engagement has not yielded desired results.
Therefore, selection of lending instruments should take into account lessons learned and capacities in a
particular sector.
78.
Simplify project design. Numerous reports including the country lending assessment by QAG
have stressed the importance of simple design, yet many projects continue to be complicated, resulting in
poor performance and delays in implementation evidenced by the number of extensions. It has also
contributed to dependence on consultants rather than government to implement development programs
thus undermining government capacity. The CAS review has alluded to weak implementation largely due
to inadequate incentives and sanctions, issues that need to be addressed in order to avoid extensive use of
PIUs. Mainstreaming of PIUs is also a challenge given the weak incentive system in government.
Therefore, a simpler design based on available capacity may help to ameliorate some of these risks.
79.
Design analytical and advisory activities with more attention to clients and eventual
dissemination. The QAG evaluation of AAA in Zambia recommended, among others, that there should
be consultation in the design, participation in analysis and prioritization and sequencing of
recommendations. Where possible, an action plan should be prepared as a way of monitoring the use of
such recommendations. Emphasis should be placed on demand driven studies including short policy notes
that are likely to have an impact on both policy dialogue and the lending program. In addition, flexibility
in allocation of resources for this purpose may help the Bank to respond quickly to emerging issues that
may occur from time to time.
80.
Work in partnerships to leverage resources. Given the comparative strengths of CPs and the
agreement to work in harmonization, it will be critical to work in partnerships during the new CAS period
in order to also leverage resources.
81.
Position the Bank in roles that reinforce ability to deliver on CAS objectives. As part of the
new CAS and harmonization processes, the Bank needs to reassess its strategic position in Zambia and
determine where it can/should be lead, active, passive or disengaged based on (i) strategy; (ii) resources
and (iii) comparative advantage. It would be useful to decide on the criteria for selection, and the
implications (budget, staffing, program) prior to making the decision on how the Bank should be
positioned in various sectors.

•During the latter years of the CAS (especially FY0607), business indicators and ICA are commonly used to
highlight the need for Zambia to be competitive.
However, in spite of the PSD dialogue, the business
environment has not shown progress and Zambia is still
ranked towards the bottom end of the scale. A one-stop
investment agency, the Zambia Development Agency
was finally created in 2007.

• Indicators revised and therefore, original CAS
indicators not monitored.
•Growth of national gemstone exports by 10% per year.

• Bank support through ERIPTA, CEM, ROADSIP,
MTSP, SEED, RRMP, Railways Restructuring, Power
Rehab, ADSP, and ICA.

• The Bank contributed to these outcomes mainly
through EMGC 1 and PSCAP.
•The country achieved a growth conducive environment
as reflected in a single rate of inflation (8.9% at the end
of December, 2007), a stable exchange rate and reduced
domestic borrowing. Zambia reached HIPC completion
point and received MDRI such that the net present value
of external debt to exports was only 16% in 2006
compared to 140% before HIPC.
•GRZ has moved from a cash budget to an MTEF based
ABB budget from the 2004 FY. Three MTEF budgets
have been now produced including 2007.
•Complete privatization of ZANACO was delayed
initially due to hesitation on the part of government to
privatize it.
•Privatization and restructuring could not be achieved
within the one-year period of an adjustment loan.

CAS outcomes that the Bank expected to
influence through its interventions and outcome
level indicators

• Share of TEVET graduates from socio-economically
disadvantaged groups increased by 10%. No data are
given for females.

•According to ISR in December, 2005; 95.4% of
employers surveyed in the tracer study perceived the
training to be relevant and 95.9% perceived the training
to be of quality. (These were proxy indicators). 70% of
TEVET graduates found employment within 6 months
after graduating was achieved in 2003

•This was revised to an output indicator and monitored
as part of HIPC completion point. Government turned
down privatization and therefore, commercialization
was only the second best option. Financial performance
of ZESCO is not yet on a sound footing, and the power
sector is currently in crisis.
• This experience illustrates the need to be mindful of
the political economy of reform.

•Collaboration with other development partners
(notably the EU) has contributed to progress. Issues
still remain on adequate maintenance of infrastructure.

• Government monitoring system in place through
annual assessments. However, due to required level of
resources, assessments are now done biennially and
latest data not yet available by end of January, 2008.

•The Bank was concerned with monitoring poverty
reducing expenditures that were funded 100% and
therefore, without any variation.

• Targets not reached due to delays in EDRP project
start up and an increase in costs of inputs.

•Target almost achieved for the envisioned one year

• Not all indicators were measured and there are data
inconsistencies. M and E plan should be developed at
early stage to guide data collection and monitoring.
•Inadequate data.

•During implementation of the CAS, this was fine tuned
to Gross Intake Rate
•Even though the CAS result expected was improved
quality, only the learning outcome indicator measured
quality, while the completion rate measured both quality
and coverage. Consequently, it is difficult to state that
the quality of education has improved in Zambia based
