EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

i.
Niger i s a vast landlocked Sahelian country bridging Sub-Saharan and N o r t h Africa,
facing many new challenges and opportunities to create a better future for i t s children. The
country i s endowed with important mineral resources, such as uranium, gold and possibly oil, which
provide good prospects for creating national prosperity, if well-managed, but which are also at the
heart o f recent conflicts. With some 80 percent o f i t s population living in the countryside, the most
effective strategies for raising incomes and reducing poverty l i e in rural development. Niger has
great potential for irrigation and agricultural production and has extensive herds o f cattle and goats,
all o f which represent a promising potential for increasing revenues if provided adequate support to
grow and diversify. In this context, strengthening Niger’s regional trade integration, and trade
arrangements, i s a key element for unlocking the country’s growth potential.

..

At the same time, Niger faces many hardships that cannot be underestimated. The
country i s confronted by a harsh climate, with nearly 90 percent o f the territory receiving less than
350 mm o f rain every year, resulting in regular droughts. The country also must adapt to the gradual
advance o f the Sahara desert and manage locust invasions. Due to a combination o f geography, weak
policies and lack o f resources, one third o f the population i s in a situation o f chronic food insecurity.
Increased food and o i l prices are having significant impact o n the poor and have created added
difficulties for the country in the short-term.
11.

iii. Despite being a sparsely populated country of 13 million, Niger’s fertility rates are
relatively high and the population growth rate i s one of the fastest in the world, around 3.3
percent, and this has created increased pressure on arable land, water resources and government
services, particularly along the fertile southern border areas where the majority o f the population i s
concentrated. Meanwhile, for many years economic growth has not kept up with population, and the
government has become increasingly aware o f the need to accelerate economic growth and address
demographic issues in order to have an impact on the country’s development prospects and to reduce
poverty.
iv.
Niger i s still among the poorest countries in the world. Nevertheless, there are recent
indications of improved access to basic education and better health outcomes, showing that
government efforts, supported by development partners, are beginning to have results. Although
Niger i s not expected to meet the MDGs, this has helped to create a renewed impetus to achieve these
goals.
v.
Against this backdrop, the Government in 2007 led the preparation of the country’s
Strategy for Accelerated Development and Poverty Reduction, or the second Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRSP 11). PRSP I1 was prepared in a participatory process and was endorsed by
development partners at a Roundtable meeting in Brussels in October 2007. PRSP I1proposes that in
order to reach the MDGs, Niger will need to sustain an average annual growth rate o f 7 percent over
the medium-term. Achieving such a high growth rate for Niger will require significant investments in
infrastructure and basic services, as well as improved capacity to implement reforms, administer
basic services and attract private sector investments. PRSP I1 provides only the broad thrust o f the
priorities for achieving the MDGs. As such, the Government i s preparing an Accelerated Growth

i

Strategy that will provide more concrete details on h o w i t will effectively support the drivers o f
growth (“growth clusters”) and the reforms it will implement.
The Bank’s strategy to contribute to PRSP I1 objectives i s built around two strategic
vi.
objectives, or pillars:

Accelerating Sustained Growth that is Equitably Shared. Under this pillar, the Bank will
increase i t s support to sectors where i t has a comparative advantage in Niger, such as to
support policies and investments to promote rural “growth clusters,” such as agro-pastoral
products and exports and mining; strengthen economic infrastructure services, including
irrigation, transport, and municipal services; improve the business and investment climate;
and strengthen regional integration; and
Developing Human Capital through Equal Access to Quality Social Services. Under this
pillar, the Bank will support social infrastructure, such as water and sanitation services, basic
education, health services, including H W / A I D S prevention and treatment, decentralized
financing mechanisms for basic services, and community driven development. The Bank will
also continue to support Government response for emergencies, such as food insecurity,
locust invasions and avian flu. T o achieve greater strategic selectivity, the Bank will
gradually reduce i t s direct support to some human development sectors where other donors
are present and have a comparative advantage.
vii.
T w o hndamental and cross-cutting issues o n which the Bank will work closely with Niger in
order to achieve results under the two CAS pillars are governance, with an emphasis on economic
and financial management and capacity-building, and population growth.

viii.
The International Development Association’s indicative annual allocation during IDA
15 is about SDR 57 million. In FY08, N i g e r received 50 percent o f i t s IDA allocation o n grant
terms and 50 percent o n credit terms and this i s the expectation for FY09. The C A S proposes that
any variations in the IDA allocation w o u l d b e offset by adjusting the financing for budget
support o r n e w investment operations. T o leverage IDA support, the B a n k will seek to design
B a n k projects with parallel o r co-financing with donor a n d o r private participation, especially in
the sustainable development and human development sectors.
ix.
While the balance of risks is currently favorable, Niger faces potential downside risks of
exogenous shocks including drought and terms o f trade. Vulnerability vis-a-vis climate variability
and change, desertification, and terms o f trade shocks (notably fluctuations in the price o f uranium
and oil), are perennial challenges to Niger’s economy.
x.

The following questions are suggested for Board discussion:
Does the proposed strategy adequately contribute to Niger’s PRSP I1priority objectives?
I s the selectivity o f the C A S appropriate for the Bank, in light o f limited IDA resources?

Are the risks properly identified and mitigated?

THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covers the four-year period from FY08 to
FY11. I t sets out planned lending and non-lending activities o f the World Bank Group in
support o f Niger’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP 11) to achieve the country’s
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Niger’s PRSP I1was discussed at the Board on April
29,2008 and the previous CAS on January 14,2003.
2.
The CAS considers Niger’s central challenge o f accelerating and broadening economic
growth so that i t translates into reduced poverty. To this end, the CAS proposes a program
focused on supporting the drivers o f growth in Niger; strengthening the management o f public
finances and improving access to basic social services. Consequently, the CAS has two strategic
objectives: 1) Accelerating sustainable economic growth that i s equitably shared; and 2)
Developing human capital through equal access to quality social services. Supporting Niger’s
efforts to slow the rapid rate o f population growth, to allow economic growth to have an impact
o n poverty, i s an essential element o f PRSP I1and i s treated as a cross cutting issue. Promoting
good governance, to ensure that increased revenues from growth are efficiently spent and
broadly shared, i s also a cross-cutting issue for the CAS.

I.COUNTRY
CONTEXT
A. Socioeconomic Background

3.
Located on a vast landlocked territory o f 1.267 million s q km situated on the southern
edge o f the Sahara, Niger has a long and rich history. Ancient towns such as Agadez were
established in the 11th century, growing up under the Songhai Empire, Almoravid Empire o f
Tombouctou, the Peul Empire o f Sokoto and the sultanate o f Bornu. The largest ethnicities today
are the Hausa, the Djerma, and the Songhai, who are sedentary farmers living on the arable
southern tier. Many o f Niger’s inhabitants are nomadic or semi-nomadic livestock-raising
peoples, including the Tuareg, the Fulani, or Peul and the Kanouri-Manga.
Only 10 percent o f Niger’s territory, or 120,000 sq km, benefits from rain-fed agriculture.
4.
The rest o f the country, areas receiving less than 300 mm o f rainfall, must be irrigated. Rain-fed
crops such as millet, sorghum, niebe, yams, manioc, and rice, cultivated along the Niger River
and in low-lying areas bordering Nigeria, are principal staples. Groundnuts and onions are
important agricultural export commodities. Livestock include cattle, sheep, goats and camels.
Cattle and sheep are exported mainly on the h o o f to Nigeria, along with hides and leather.
Uranium has been mined industrially since 1971 and a gold mine opened in 2007. Other deposits
include coal, limestone, phosphates, tungsten and tin. Petroleum i s under exploration.
B. Political Context

5.
Niger i s a new democracy which has begun to establish a track record of democratic
governance. Niger became independent from France in 1960, only to face single party r u l e for
1

the next thirty years until strong opposition pressure by students and trade unionists led to a
“National Conference” (1991), the appointment o f a transitional government, and finally free
elections. After another eight years o f instability and economic adjustment, free and fair
presidential and legislative elections led to the election o f President Mamadou Tandja in 1999
and set the country on a more optimistic course o f development. Niger concluded a new threeyear Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility agreement with the IMF just one year later and
adopted a PRSP in 2002, based on broad popular consultation. President Tandja was re-elected in
2004. This new era o f stability paved the way for economic and financial reform and the
strengthening o f health and education services in order to reach the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). In2005, local elections were successfully held.
C. Poverty Context
Despite progress in real GDP growth in recent years, the average per capita income in
Niger has not improved and social indicators remain among the weakest in the world. Niger i s
one o f the poorest countries in the world, with the average annual per capita income estimated at
US$260 (2006), and 62 percent o f the population estimated to be living below the poverty line.
In rural areas, poverty i s estimated at 66 percent, compared to 55 percent in urban areas
(excluding Niamey). While there i s no definitive evidence on the poverty trend, a one percent
per year decline in GDP per capita between 2001 and 2004-followed by the acute food crisis o f

6.

2005-suggest that poverty may have increased during those years. The 2007/2008 Household
Budget Survey is expected to update information on the poverty trend.’
7.
An unfriendly environment for growth: Geography, climate, demographics and
institutions. Niger’s economic growth and its potential impact on poverty are constrained by a
number o f factors: Agricultural production i s limited by climatic variability, inadequate irrigation
and the limited use o f modern inputs. Dependence on a narrow economic base-agricultural and
mineral commodity exports-leaves
the economy vulnerable to price shocks. However,
economic diversification is hampered by inadequate road and transport networks and the high
cost o f doing business due to weak financing systems, poor judiciary and legal practices, weak
private sector support institutions and a low-skilled workforce. Being a landlocked country with
no seacoast, Niger’s exports and imports also face high transport costs. Rapid population growth
reduces the impact o f growth and creates increased demands for basic social services from
institutions with weak capacity that are stretched to their limit.
8.
Increasing desertipcation and drought, coupled with a fast growing population, makes
rural livelihoods precarious. Climatic variability and change has become more apparent in
Niger, which has experienced more frequent drought years during the 1990s as compared to the
average from 1961 to 2001. The 2005 drought and locust infestation are a case in point: GDP fell
by one percent and almost h a l f the population lacked food due to the failure o f staple crops.
Nigeriens’ ability to adapt to climatic change and desertification is further compounded by
unsustainable land management practices-overstocking o f livestock, ploughing erodible soils,
poor or nonexistant rural infrastructure, and expansion o f agriculture into marginal regions-in
an effort to meet the needs o f a fast growing population. Niger’s population, estimated at 14

I

Survey of basic werfare indicators (QUIBB) World Bank, 2005.

2

million in 2008, i s growing at a rate o f 3.3 percent a year, among the fastest in the world, due
primarily to declining mortality levels2 and high fertility rates3 In a context o f declining rainfall
and cyclical droughts, communities overexploit natural resources in order to maintain or increase
their level o f production. The result i s soil depletion, loss o f fertility, lower yields, and
environmental degradation, which has progressively led to an environment-poverty nexus that
contributes to increasing food insecurity and poverty.
Food insecurity and chronic poverty have become an endemic problem. Nearly 80
9.
percent o f the population, mainly in rural areas, i s at risk o f food insecurity. The situation i s
aggravated by the high incidence o f rural poverty, characterized by l o w household purchasing
power, lack o f access to food for vulnerable groups, rampant malnutrition and a lack o f basic
health services. With continued dependence on rain-fed staple crops, hunger and the specter o f
famine loom large in the lives o f Niger’s poor. In this context, malnutrition affects 44 percent o f
children under five and i s associated with a loss o f human development and weak future
earnings. As malnutrition perpetuates poverty and poverty perpetuates malnutrition, the loss o f
human development potential i s often transferred from one generation to the next, as illustrated
by the very high malnutrition rate among women.
Poverty is exacerbated by inequality which affects girls, women and children
10.
disproportionately. The poorest quintile o f the population in Niger consumes only one-fifth o f
what the top quintile does.4 Women bear an unequal and particularly heavy burden, especially
young single mothers with no access to land or other resources. Marrying as early as fifteen, girls
are most likely to drop out o f school to tend to the household and work in the fields.

D. Progress toward the MDGs

11.
Niger is far behind in reaching the MDGs and will need more time, and donor support,
to meet most goals. The country i s ranked 174th in the 2007 UN Human Development Index o f
177 countries. The country started from a very l o w base in 1990 when the MDGs were launched.
Niger would have had to increase i t s primary education completion rate from 18 percent in 1990
to 100 percent in 2015, i t s gender parity index from 56 percent to 100 percent, and reduce underfive mortality rate from 322 per 1,000 to 109 per 1,000. In the 1990s, no sound strategy was in
place to pursue the M D G s in any area, in large part because political instability made such
planning and implementation difficult and resources were scarce. Public resources allocated to
social services were very low, from 3.2 percent o f GDP in 1990 to 2.1 percent in 1999 for the
education sector5 with expenditures for health amounting to 1.6 percent o f GDP in 1 9 9 8 4 n e o f
the lowest levels in West Africa.

* Infant mortality has declined and for the first time m a y be under the threshold o f 100 deaths per 1,000 live births.
The under-five mortality rate has also decreased due t o immunization. However, N i g e r has s t i l l the third highest
under-five mortality rate ( U N D P 2005 Human Development Report), despite a n annual decrease o f 1.5 percent a
year. Malnutrition (50 percent o f under-fives) seems to be the m a i n cause o f mortality.
With 7 children per woman, Niger’s total fertility rate i s among the highest in the world.

12.
However, a few notable achievements have been made in education and health
indicators, as shown in Table 1.6 W h i l e Niger i s not expected to reach the MDGs by 2015, these
figures show progress in some sectors and the challenge will be to maintain and accelerate this
momentum, which will require substantial technical and financial support from development
partners. With the preparation o f the first PRSP in the early 2000s, there was a renewed impetus
to reach the MDGs, with education and health development plans prepared and eventually
national strategies for other sectors, including the 2003 Rural Development Strategy.
13.
Putting the economy on a path of higher growth and making adequate progress toward
the MDGs will require continued prudent fiscal policies and reforms to address long-standing
structural obstacles. Accelerating economic growth will require a rapid increase in agricultural
productivity, a much more sustainable use o f natural resources, the mainstreaming o f climate
risks and o f environmental management in all development sectors and a broad diversification o f
the economic base. These, in turn, require higher public and private investment and a more
favorable business environment. In this respect, effective implementation o f the rural sector
medium-term strategy which focuses o n irrigation and the introduction o f modem and
sustainable farming techniques, combined with large donor assistance, will be critical to Niger’s
prospects for growth and poverty reduction.

In addition, the Primary Gross Enrollment Rate more than doubled between 1990 and 2005-increasing from 25
percent in 1991 to 42 percent in 2001-02 to 54 percent in 2005. The primary completion rate grew from 18 percent
in 1990 to 26 percent in 2001-02 and 40 percent in 2005. The infant mortality rate has declined from 126/1,000 live
births to 81/1,000 in 2006; the under-five mortality rate has declined from 322/1,000 c h l d r e n under five to
198/1,000; and the maternal mortality rate has declined from 700 per 100,000 to 650 per 100,000. The immunization
rate doubled, from 18 percent to 37 percent. Bucking the trend, the prevalence o f underweight children appears to be
on the rise afler a decade o f steady but slight decline.

11. ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS
AND OUTLOOK
A. Historical Context

14.
Since 1960, Niger's economy has essentially gone through four phases with periods o f
high volatility (Figure 1):
From 1960 to 1974: The economy was dominated by rain-fed agriculture and livestock,
which accounted for 60 percent o f GDP. Groundnuts accounted for 50 to 70 percent o f
exports and served as a catalyst for industrial development (processing groundnut oil),
transport infrastructure development and trade with Nigeria. Three years o f drought almost
halted production in the mid 1970s and average GDP growth o f 1.4 percent fell below the
population growth rate.
F r o m 1975 to 1982: Uranium extraction, which started in 1971, gave a significant boost to
the economy. Uranium prices increased five-fold as many countries turned to nuclear power
during the international o i l crisis. The boom was short-lived, lasting just over a decade, long
enough to increase Government revenues from 6.1 percent o f GDP in 1974 to almost 15
percent by 198 1. This led to excessive spending. The civil service expanded significantly
(accounting in large part for today's high public sector wage bill) and government invested in

7

See CAS Annex 5 for complete MDG table.

5

a large number o f public enterprises, many operating with no comparative advantage in subsectors such as import substitution. Real GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent, slightly above
population growth o f around 3 percent.
From 1983-2000: The decline o f uranium prices and recurrent droughts, coupled with
political and social instability by the earlier nineties, led to an economic downturn. Real
economic growth was estimated at 0.9 percent on average, and real per capita growth at -2.2
percent.

From 2001-2006: Structural reforms (Box 1) initiated in 2001 led to reduced economic
volatility and increased contributions o f telecoms, transports and mining to economic growth.
Average GDP growth reached 4.6 percent (1.3 percent above the population growth rate), but
a severe drought and locust invasion led to an economic contraction in 2005,

Reforms introduced by the authorities in 2001 aimed at improving public expenditure
management, enhancing domestic revenue mobilization, and strengthening the economy’s
supply reforms (Box 1). A s a result, the formulation and execution o f the budget have improved;
domestic revenue collection has increased, though starting from a l o w level; privatization and
other reforms to promote private sector development have helped strengthen the performance o f
the nonagricultural sector; and private investment has increased.* In addition, resources provided
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) helped to increase pro-poor spending
and reduce the debt b ~ r d e n . ~

From 6.2 percent in 2002 to an estimated 14.4 percent in 2007
Niger reached the completion point under the initiative in 2004; debt relief, including topping-up, reduced the NPV
o f debt-to-exports ratio from 390 percent at end-2002 to about 150 percent at end-2004. A l l creditors except for
Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Taiwan Province of China, and the United Arab Emirates, have signed agreements to provide
debt relief including topping-up.

Box 1: Progress in Implementing Selected Structural Reforms (2000-2007)
Customs and tax administration: (1) adoption o f monthly performance indicators for the m a i n customs offices and
consistently tracking compliance; (2) establishment o f an issue-oriented audit unit in the large and medium-size
taxpayer office; (3) strengthening the large tax payers office; (4) instituting j o i n t pre-shipment company-customs
imports verification teams at several border offices; and (5) implementation o f an action plan to enhance the
mobilization o f tax revenues.
Public expenditure management: (1) adoption o f a new budgetary nomenclature, public accounts charter and a n e w
procurement law; (2) introduction o f a FMIS, the setting up o f a Treasury-Budget computer interface, and
computerization o f regional treasury offices; (3) a comprehensive assessment o f Niger’s public fiiancial
management systems through a PEMFAR, with assistance f r o m the EU and the Bank, and adoption o f an action
plan; (4) the preparation and incorporation into the budget o f medium-term expenditure frameworks for health and
education; (5) adoption o f a unified list o f priority expenditure; (6) effective establishment o f t h e new General
Directorate for Public Procurement; (7) creation o f the independent Audit Court, and (8) separation o f financial
control, training o f agents and appointment o f staff t o the n e w independent Audit Court. Despite these actions, a
significant number o f actions are needed to W h e r strengthen PEM. To t h ~ send, the action plan (2007-2009) has
been updated.
Financial sector reform, privatization, and the regulatory environment: (1) restructuring and recapitalization o f
two partially state-owned banks, the restructuring o f the housing bank; (2) the telecommunication sector has been
liberalized and a Multi-sector Regulatory Agency set up; (3) several state-owned enterprises were privatized
including cement, textile, diary, and telecom companies; and (4) one-stop center for investment was created, n e w
mining code was adopted, and steps were taken t o streamline the business regulations. Despite the progress in
financial sector reform, the sector remains relatively underdeveloped, access to credit by the private sector i s s t i l l
limited, and nonperfonning loans are relatively high. The cost o f doing business also remains high.
Trade reforms: (1) in 2000 Niger adopted the WAEMU common external tariff, with four rates (0, 5, 10, and 20
percent); and (2) in 2005 Niger removed duties o n imports (manufacturing, animal products and vegetables) f r o m a l l
Economic Community o f West African States (ECOWAS) members.

B. Recent Performance

16.
With an estimated real GDP growth rate of 5.2 percent in 2006 and 3.2 percent in
2007, the economy has recovered from the impact of the 2004 drought and locust invasion.
Good rains in the last three years have boosted agricultural production and improved food
security. Investment in the mining, telecoms and construction has also supported economic
activity. In particular, gold production has recorded an upturn with the reopening o f the principal
mine and a major investment program i s in progress for uranium. Average inflation has
averaged 1.8 percent during 2002-2006 and in 2007 i s estimated to be zero. Trends in the balance
o f payments in 2007 showed a strong increase in the value o f uranium exports, reflecting a 58
percent revaluation o f the export price. This has been accompanied by a strong increase in
imports o f capital goods, both for the mining sector and for infrastructure projects, in addition to
the replenishment o f the stocks o f petroleum and grain products. Thus, the current account deficit
is estimated to have risen from 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 7.7 percent o f GDP in 2007.
Recent fiscal performance has also been favorable and implementation of the 2007
17.
budget suggests continued fiscal prudence. From 2002 to 2006, the basic fiscal deficit has
averaged 2.0 percent. In 2007, it is estimated at 0.9 percent o f GDP, comparing to an initial

7

projection o f 4.1 percent. Revenues o f 15.5 percent o f GDP exceeded expectations, largely due
to the favorable performance o f the VAT and exceptionally high mining receipts."
Expenditures, excluding externally funded investments, are estimated at 16.4 percent o f GDP.
There has been some progress with plans to reduce the government's domestic arrears, including:
(i)
finalizing plans for cross-settlements with public utility companies to offset government debts
and claims; (ii)
initiating the settlement o f arrears owed to private suppliers; and (iii)
plans to
reimburse depositors o f the former National Saving Bank when the new postal bank
(FINAPOSTE) becomes operational in 2008.
C. Medium-Term Prospects

18.
Niger's medium-term macroeconomic outlook appears favorable due to increased
fiscal space resulting from the HIPC and MDRI debt relief proceeds and increased investments
in mining, infrastructure and agriculture. Based o n the latest Bank and IMF assessments, annual
real GDP growth i s projected to average about 5 percent over the 2008-2012 period, fostered
mainly by increased public investments in infrastructure and social services and private
investment in the uranium mining sector.
The external current account deficit is projected to increase to 16.7percent of GDP by
19.
2012, reflecting a rise in capital and intermediate goods imported to sustain investments in
mining and infrastructure. The overall fiscal deficit (commitment basis excluding grants) would
increase to 9.8 percent due to public expenditures planned for social and infrastructure

investments and associated recurrent outlays. Total expenditures would average about 23 percent
o f GDP from 2008 to 2012. The total financing gap resulting from the base-case scenario would
be around F C A F 1300 billions (or 10.1 percent o f GDP) and would be filled by bilateral and
multilateral donor support to the budget.
Annual GDP growth is expected to be about 5 percent of GDP afer the moderation of
the uranium boom from 2017 onwards. Mining companies have confirmed investments
estimated at US$1.6 billion in the uranium sector and production i s project to double by 2012
and triple by 2017. The government plans to use increasing uranium revenues to diversify i t s

20.

economy by: (i)
modernizing agriculture (irrigation) and livestock to mitigate the impact o f
recurrent droughts; (ii)investing in infrastructure (feeder roads, water management for
accelerating reforms
agriculture production) to ease transport and public utility services; and (iii)
to improve the investment climate. Inflation would be contained within WAEMU convergence
criteria (i.e., less than 3 percent).

21.

According to the latest IMF- WBjoint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) external debt
indicators over the long run remain below the policy-based thresholds and the debt burden i s

projected to increase only gradually over time (Annex 4). Niger remains at moderate risk o f debt
distress, given the prospect o f faster export growth and assuming that new borrowing continues
to be on very concessional terms.

10

The Government set up a Priority Investment Fund t o use mining revenues for expenditures in security, rural
development, infrastructure, and development support.

111. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMAND ISSUES

A. Strategy to Accelerate Growth and Poverty Reduction (PRSP 11)
The Government’s PRSP 11for 2008 to 2012 was prepared through a broad-based
participatory process and endorsed by donors at a Roundtable meeting in Brussels in October

22.

2007. The Government’s strategy takes into account lessons learned from PRSP I,emphasizing
the priority o f creating an enabling environment for accelerated economic growth, with strong
support from the development partners, leading to equitable poverty reduction. As presented in
the PRSP 11, the Government’s strategy is to reach average annual growth rates o f 7 percent in
order to reach the M D G s by 2015. The Government recognizes that this i s an ambitious goal and
has prepared an equally ambitious program with the support o f donors. The base-case and
intermediate case scenarios estimate growth at 4.2 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively, the
latter being in line with Bank and IMF projections.
To achieve growth rates that will allow Niger to reach the MDGs, the Government’s
23.
PRSP I1i s articulated around seven pillars:

(i) Pursuing strong, diversified, sustainable and equitable growth that creates job. The
strategy i s to promote sectors that are the engines o f growth, creating employment and
enhancing incomes: rural development, the extractive industries, the agro-pastoral sector
with the diversification o f products for export; tourism and local crafts through an enabling
private sector, attractive to investment, bolstered by improved financial service and efficient
public utilities.
Sustaining macroeconomic stabilization through improved fiscal
performance, together with prudent, better managed public expenditures and debt, will be
key factors to success. The government will also pursue sustainable natural resources
management and mainstreaming measures to mitigate climate risk under this pillar.
(ii)Developing infrastructure. Improved economic infrastructure (irrigation works, road and
rail transport, transit facilities and telecommunications) i s fbndamental to the growth agenda.
Government will promote the involvement o f the private sector and improve the regulatory
framework.
(iii)Creating equitable access to quality social services. The goal i s universal access, with
gender parity to social services, with the improvement o f health and education outcomes.
Expansion and maintenance o f social infrastructure (health center, primary and lower
secondary schools; water and sanitation) i s a key component.
(iv) Gender empowerment and socialprotection. This pillar has three main focuses: (a) the
economic empowerment o f women through access to land and input, credit and technical
advice, under the protection o f family law; (b) ensuring the protection o f children, youth and
vulnerable groups such as the HIV/AIDS positive and PLWA, providing economic and social
support programs and (c) programs to reduce vulnerabilities, mitigate the impact o f natural
disasters, including climate change, notably by ensuring food security.
(v) Slowing population growth. Government will improve access to reproductive health
services, promote delayed marriage for young girls and work toward greater social
comprehension o f the links between population and economic growth.

9

(vi) Promoting Good Governance' and Capacity-Building. This pillar covers political
governance (elections, civil involvement, policy consultations); an anti-corruption program,;
strengthening justice services; public administration and civil service. reform; and economic
governance to strengthen public financal management.

(vii) Efficient implementation of the PRSP. The Government will focus on strengthening
the planning capacities o f sector ministries to ensure timely preparation o f sector strategies,
sector programs and related-MTEFs. Government will also establish a results-based
Monitoring and Evaluation system.

B. Key Development Challenges and Opportunities
1. Regional and Global Integration
24.
Accelerating Niger's integration into regional and global markets is key to achieving
higher growth rates and reaching the MDGs, which the country cannot do by relying solely on
country-level investments, debt relief, and structural reforms. Bound by seven countries
(Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Benin and Mali), Niger must rely on regional
markets rather than its small national market for economies o f scale and scope in trade and
infrastructure.
25.
Nigeria and other countries in the region are Niger's main market for non-mineral
exports, and offer great potential for expansion and diversification o f its products. Nigeria i s not
only the main trading partner, but also the country that offers the greatest potential because o f its
size and diversified economy. Africa's most important o i l producer, Nigeria contributes
significantly and increasingly to Niger's growth, through demands for exports, essentially agropastoral; but Nigeria also exports to Niger more than 90 percent o f its electricity needs under a
state-to-state agreement in which prices are set below international prices. While this is
beneficial to Niger, there i s no guarantee that such an agreement will last indefinitely. Niger
should put in place an operational trade strategy with Nigeria over the next two years." In
addition, a significant amount o f trade between the two countries i s informal and unofficial.

26.
Niger is a key member of important regional organizations covering economic,
monetary, financial, and business regulations. As a member o f the WAEMU, Niger shares a
common currency (the C F A franc), a common central bank (BCEAO) and common trade
policies with seven other West African countries. The harmonization o f sector policies and legal
and regulatory frameworks with a view to creating a larger, more open and competitive West
African economic space, including in transport and transit, energy and telecoms sectors, i s being
pursued through both WAEMU and ECOWAS. I t is also at the forefront o f the revitalization o f
the Niger River organization that promotes coordination and cooperation between riparian
countries in managing water resources in the Niger River Basin

" Niger: Modernizing Trade during a Mining Boom: Diagnostic Trade Integration Study for the Integrated
Framework Program, World Bank, February 2008.

10

2. Economic Infrastructure
27.
Lack of economic infrastructure is a major constraint to growth. The potential for food
crops, vital to food security, and for agricultural and livestock exports which could boost income
for the poorest i s severely constrained by the lack o f infrastructure with regard to irrigation
works, the transport corridors to markets (pistes rurales, primary and secondary roads), market
infrastructure (conservation and processing facilities), compounded by the absence o f the modem
communication capacity required for the flow o f market information. Transport and
communication infrastructure are also vital for the development o f the other potential growth
sectors, mining and tourism.
3. Extractive Industries

28.
Mining legal and institutional framework needs to be adapted for rising demand: Niger
is endowed with the world’s largest deposits o f uranium and i s the world’s 3‘d largest exporter.
Uranium and gold account for 40 percent o f Niger’s export receipts. The country also has
deposits o f oil, iron, phosphate, salt, copper and tin. There i s an artisanal mining sector which
contributes less to tax revenues but has a more significant impact o n jobs. Some measures should
be taken to support artisanal miners considering the level o f poverty affecting them. The
population living on gold mining is estimated at between 80,000 and 120,000. Renewed interest
in nuclear energy has led to a sharp rise in uranium prices. Existing mines are expected to
increase production and two new mines will enter production by 2012. The total value o f
uranium exports could increase from CFAF 80 billion in 2006 to CFAF 400-500 billion by 2014.
Good management and use o f government revenues will become one o f the most important
challenges for the Niger government in the near future.

4. Rural Development
29.
A key development challenge for Niger is to unlock the growth potential of the
agricultural sector. Increasing agriculture productivity by one percent o f GDP would have a
multiplier effect o f increasing GDP by 1.9 to 2.6 percent, helping to significantly reduce
poverty.” However, agricultural production is constrained by a number o f factors, including
climate variability and change and the rudimentary nature o f agricultural techniques. The
Government’s 2003 Rural Development Strategy and 2006 Action Plan provide the framework
for national efforts to increase production in the agriculture, livestock and forest and fisheries
sectors, by: 1) providing support for livestock and their by-products (leather, meat); 2)
supporting agricultural products, including investing in irrigation infrastructure, farming
technologies research and TA; 3) strengthening production and conservation o f staple crops and
export-competitive produce; 4) fighting desertification and degradation o f the environment;
access to credit; and improving the flow o f market information; and 5) strengthening the
management o f natural resources. These activities should integrate climate risk in their design
and implementation.

5. The Investment Climate
30.
A perception of a weak investment climate: Niger suffers from a negative perception of
its investment climate. Among the key issues identified by businesses are: corruption; the
inconsistent application o f regulations; l o w efficiency o f the judiciary; a heavy tax burden;
difficulties in getting financing, which i s expensive; competition from the informal sector; and
weak infrastructure services. In addition, labor costs are high relative to productivity. l3

The 2007 Doing Business report ranks Niger as one o f the countries in which i t i s most
difficult to engage in private activities-16Oth out o f 175. The report notes that while the high
number o f procedures and delays contribute to this ranking, the excessive cost o f doing business
probably constitutes an even greater barrier to entry and hinders the daily operation o f f i r m s

32.
The Doing Business report has helped sensitize government and stakeholders in Niger to
the importance o f reforming taxation and regulatory systems. With the notable exception o f the
2005 VAT reform and adoption in 2000 o f the common WAEMU external tariff, many o f the
reforms remain in initial stages o f formulation.

A shallow and expensive financial sector: Niger’s financial sector i s small, in part
33.
because o f the relatively small size o f the economy but also the dominance o f the informal
ten banks14 and two quasi
sector. Besides the BCEAO, Niger’s financial sector consists o f (i)
banks; (ii)
four insurance companies and some insurance brokers; (iii)
a statutory bodies pension
scheme within the Treasury and a private sector pension institution ;(iv) some 116 microfinance
institutions (MFI), mostly credit unions involved in micro lending; and (v) a local branch o f the
regional stock exchange and one broker. More than 50 percent o f enterprises surveyed for the
2006 I C A rated the cost o f financing as a major or severe problem, and more than 70 percent
rated access to financing as a major business constraint.
6. Health, Water and Sanitation

34.
Child mortality is one of the highest in the world. Malnutrition i s the most frequent
underlying factor. Direct factors include malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea, as in most SubSaharan African countries. One o f the key bottlenecks to the improving child health i s the lack o f
a community health policy.
35.
Maternal mortality is about 650per 100,000 live births, one of the highest rates in SubSaharan Africa. This reflects, among various factors, the high fertility rate, the lack o f skilled
staff and l o w level o f prenatal and postnatal coverage. Only 19 percent o f births are attended by
skilled staff. The prenatal and postnatal coverage are 46 percent and 24 percent, respectively.
There are severe regional disparities in the availability o f trained health staff that are
concentrated in the towns, especially Niamey. Rural women are at greatest risk. Early marriage
i s one o f the main factors in maternal mortality: 11.4 percent o f women between the ages o f 15
and 49 had their first child before 15.
36.
Niger’s HIV/AIDSprevalence rate is less than onepercent, one of the lowest in Africa.
The incidence i s higher in certain urban areas such as Niamey (1.4 percent), D i f f a (1.7 percent)
and Agadez (1.6 percent). Niger plans to keep the prevalence rate l o w through preventive
education in the schools, improved reproductive health services and by maintaining a high level
o f public awareness.
37.
Niger has made substantial progress in delivery of water and sanitation services in
recent years, yet s t i l l faces major challenges for reaching MDG levels and quality o f service
provision. The urban water sub-sector covers 51 urban centers over the country. In these centers,
about 70 percent o f the population is served through 92,000 private connections and 2,800
standpipes and the urban water demand is expected to grow by 30 percent over the next decade.
In rural areas, only 52 percent o f households have a reasonable access to clean water through
6,300 boreholes and 10,500 open wells equipped with hand pumps and 250 small piped systems.

l4Three o f the banks, Banque Rdgionale de Solidaritd, Banque Atlantique Niger and SAHFI, were licensed in 2004
and 2005

13

I t i s estimated that more than 30 percent o f rural water facilities are not operating properly; this
rate may vary depending on the pace o f episodic rehabilitation programs which are carried out in
lieu o f systematic maintenance. In sanitation, progress i s lagging. Only 35 percent o f urban
households have access to latrines while in rural areas the record i s dismal, with just 5 percent
with access to latrines. These shortfalls have a major negative impact o n public health.

7. Primary Education
38.
Despite significant improvements, Niger continues to have one o f the lowest enrollment
rates in primary education in the world - with substantial regional and gender disparities. The
Primary Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) increased form 37 in 2000/01 to 57 percent in 2006/07
and the primary completion rate (PCR) grew up from 24 to 43 percent. In urban areas, 75 percent
children start primary school against only 20 percent in rural areas, where 83 percent o f the
school-aged population resides. Regional enrolment rates range from as l o w as 38 percent in
D i f f a to 99 percent in the capital. The gender gap is important, with girls representing only 42
percent o f total primary enrollment in 2007. Nevertheless, the rapid expansion o f primary
education produces a growing number o f students which post-primary schools are not prepared
to receive.
39.
The drop-out rate is high-especially for girls. While progress has been made in getting
children into school, factors such as l o w quality, early entry into the labor force and marriage
work against children completing the primary program. Only about 25 percent o f an entering
cohort completes primary school, representing a huge loss to productivity and GDP. Factors such
as early entry into the labor force and marriage work against children completing the primary
program. Moreover, only 18 percent o f sixth grade students met the targeted performance level
in French, a serious impediment to the successful pursuit o f secondary education in which
mastery o f French i s key to success, especially in scientific and technical subjects
8. Food Security and Social Protection

40.
Government programs to respond to food and nutrition crises need to be strengthened
and new safety nets need to be developed. Niger’s population suffers from chronic, seasonal
and transitory food insecurity and the poor are the most affected. The review o f the 2005 food
crisis in Niger shows that food aid i s not necessarily the most efficient means to address food
insecurity. In fact, almost 2 million people are always food insecure every year; and the cereal
market performance, which i s highly variable and dependent on the climate, level o f production
and trade conditions with neighboring countries, plays an important role in food security in the
country. Therefore, in addition to the early warning systems, a balanced mix o f policies and
programs are needed that simultaneously (i)
address the production and marketing constraints to
food availability and access, and (ii)
provide safety nets to help those who are in a situation o f
chronic food insecurity.

41.
Although the social security system i s small in coverage (less than 3 percent o f the labor
force), i t s cost and design are unsustainable and could burden public finances. B o t h the National
Social Security (Caisse Nationale de Securitk Sociale, CNSS) and the National Retirement Fund
(Fonds National de Retraite, FNR) are financially unsustainable, and paying future pensions
would require government subsidies that would be considerably regressive. Overall, the current
pension system faces many issues: (i)the high contribution rates (17 percent o f wage bill) may
14

increase cost o f labor and impede job creation in the formal sector; (ii)
the system i s not secure
and plan members face considerable uncertainty in terms o f their pensions; and (iii)
governance
structures and administrative systems are outdated and compromise the quality o f services and
the management o f assets o f plan members.

9. Gender Equality and the Empowerment o f Women
42.
Niger also compares unfavorably to other Sub-Saharan African countries in terms of
gender parity in primary school and gender parity in literacy. Niger i s still far from achieving
gender parity in primary education. The ratio o f girls to boys in primary and secondary education
i s about 69 percent, among the lowest in the sub-region (World Development Indicators, 2006).
Literacy rates are l o w in Niger, especially for young women (16 percent) compared to young
males (28 percent), reflecting inequality in access to formal schooling.
10. Economic Governance
43.
Public Finance Reform: The public finance reform program i s based on a
comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Report
(PEMFAR) prepared in conjunction with the Government, the European Union and the Afiican
Development Bank. The report presented a reform agenda to improve public finance
management and economic governance and was formally adopted by Decree in July 2005. The
public finance changes focused on (i)
the budget preparation process; (ii)
budget execution and
cash management procedures; and (iii)
improved management o f domestic debt. Reforms in
budget preparation included the elimination o f dual budget with the general and investment
budget presented in the same document since 2001; identification o f core activities requiring
protection from expenditure cuts; development o f multi-year budgeting, including preparation o f
multi-sectoral and sector-specific Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF); and the
introduction o f program-budgeting starting with basic education and health in 2003. In budget
execution, the Government introduced, among other measures, a Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) which has led to a computerization o f budgetary processes, and
revamped the cash management systems to protect priority allocations in favor o f the social
sectors.
44.
Implementation o f public finance reforms in 2006-07 included measures to fhther
strengthen (i)the government's cash management system; (ii)the process o f budgetary
allocations for priority sectors by, among others, adopting a code that identifies pro-poor
expenditures in the budget, and (iii)
the monitoring o f expenditures in education, health and the
rural sector which represented 51 percent o f the recurrent budget in 2006. The Government has
also prepared a medium-term expenditure framework for the rural sector, and a program to
modernize treasury operations i s being put in place. Measures are being taken to improve
procedures and the transparency o f public procurement. The government in 2002 developed a
new Procurement Code and created the Public Procurement Regulatory Agency and the General
Directorate for Public Procurement (which i s not yet fully operational). However, there are no
guidelines and no manual for the practical application o f the code.

45.
Corruption. Niger was ranked 123'd out o f 179 countries by Transparency International
according to their 2007 corruption perception index. As shown in Table 4, nearly 60 percent o f
15

Nigerien firms surveyed for the 2006 I C A Report ranked corruption as a “serious” problem,
creating instability in the business climate and additional costs.
46.

The Government is eager to fight corruption and strengthen public financial
management. Niger’s leadership took unprecedented actions following revelations o f misused

education funds in 2006, charging those responsible and ensuring that funds were f i l l y
reimbursed. The Government put in place the High Authority to Fight Corruption (HALC), and
appointed staff to combat corruption and promote transparency in public financial management.
47.
The Government in M a y 2007 created the Priority Investment Fund (FIP) for uranium
receipts and integrated revenues in the revised 2007 and 2008 budget laws. To strengthen
transparency and governance in the management o f mining revenues, the Government has asked
for Bank support in adhering to EITI to ensure that all financial flows are reported by operators
and matched with budget inflows. The Bank would also build upon EITI to improve how the
entire resource chain i s managed, from extraction to revenue expenditures (EITI ++).

Iv. WORLD BANKGROUPSTRATEGY
A. Progress under the 2003 CAS
48.
Implementation of the 2003 Niger CAS offers valuable lessons to guide the Bank’s
strategy to support PRSP 11 implementation, as discussed in the CAS Completion Report
(Annex 3). The CASCR concluded that there was progress in achieving the objectives o f the
strategy. Macroeconomic and financial management improved and, on the fiscal front, progress
was made in correcting structural imbalances. Bank performance was mixed in the social sectors
and had few results in agriculture and rural development sectors that are the most critical to
growth and poverty reduction. In education and health, the government prepared sector strategies
and saw some improvements in outcomes, although quality o f education remains a concern and
access to health services is s t i l l largely inadequate for most Nigeriens. Delays in project
preparation, project effectiveness and disbursements have characterized the portfolio. However,
o n the positive side o f the ledger, certain projects are likely to lead to lasting positive change o f
Niger’s economic and social fabric, including the PRODEM, Community Action Program and
Water and Sanitation Project. Lessons to highlight from the CASCR include:

A stable political climate and government commitment are key elements in
macroeconomic stabilization. The presidential, legislative and local elections created a climate
49.

which was both propitious to economic decision-making and growth-friendly. For example,
progress was made in restructuring public enterprises and two banks, which would not have been
possible in the period o f political “push back” against government by unions and students just a
few years prior to elections. Government commitment to put in place a strong economic team,
close collaboration and support from the Bank and the IMF were also factors in these positive
results.
16

50.
Failure to recognize and manage risks can be disastrous. Lack o f preparedness for
major climatic changes stopped agricultural production dead and destabilized the rural
population through food shortages which had lasting negative effects on general nutrition and
child mortality (malnutrition i s the root cause, lowering the resistance o f the very young to
infectious disease). The failure to spell out and carefilly monitor objectives and outcomes led to
a decline in the agricultural sector’s capacity (Pillar 4), no doubt compounded by the emergency
conditions o f 2005.

5 1.
When government and development partners work pro-actively as a team, backed by
strong analytical work, there can be a high level of achievement. This was the case o f the Ten
year Program (Programme Decennal) for Education and PRODEM, the demographic and
reproductive project. In the latter, the convincing nature o f the analytical work led to a
breakthrough in changed attitudes in government and the beginnings o f a broader cultural
change.
52.
The most important lesson is that CAS objectives must be specific and measurable. The
2003 CAS was not results-based and failed to spell out the capacity building objectives for the
PRSP as a whole and for specific programs and projects, making the assumption that capacitybuilding was a “built-in” mandate.
The quality of M&E remained weak overall and was non-existent for Pillar 4. The CAS
53.
will give special attention the development o f a robust M&E system, based on a manageable
number o f input, process and outcome indicators by supporting capacity building in terms o f
M&E staff, o f users in government to comprehend results and apply them to decision-making
(the PRSP notes that data collection o f programs and projects has been weak and there i s no
carry-over into decision-making). M&E results should also translate into public information,
enabling the “clients” o f public services to exert positive pressure on government. The recent
publication by the Bank’s IGE (McKay 2007) provides a good operational guide. Donors
supporting large-scale programs such as the Programme Decennal will likely condition their
continuing support for user and client-friendly M&E.

B. CAS Strategic Objectives and Principles
54.
The CAS will cover the last year of IDA-14 (FY08) and the full IDA-15period covering
FY09-11. The Bank’s strategy in Niger is built around two strategic objectives, or pillars: 1)
Accelerating Sustained Growth that i s Equitably Shared; and 2) Developing Human Capital
through Equal Access to Quality Social Services; and the cross-cutting themes o f governance
(with an emphasis on economic and financial management and capacity-building) and population
growth. This proposed platform aims to maximize synergies with the Government’s PRSP, other
development partner support, and the Bank’s Africa Action Plan by drawing o n the World Bank
Group’s comparative advantages. The CAS seeks continuity with the ongoing investment
projects and reform programs, while gradually moving toward a more programmatic approach.
55.
0

The CAS will be guided by the following principles:
Selectivity: During the CAS period, the Bank will shift its support to be more selective.
Interventions will focus o n select PRSP themes where the Bank has the greatest comparative

17

advantage, and where the Bank can complement or leverage efforts by donors. The portfolio
and sector interventions will decrease in terms o f number o f new operations proposed and
areas o f Bank presence.
Results-based approach: The CAS proposes measurable and concrete results that are to be
achieved during the 2008-2011 period with Bank support (Annex 1). This will allow the
Bank’s performance and investments to be evaluated and the strategy to be adjusted if
necessary when the Progress Report i s prepared.
Harmonization: As discussed in the section on partnerships, the Bank will continue to
promote donor harmonization and aid effectiveness in the spirit o f the Paris Declaration.
Regional synergies and integration: Accelerating growth in Niger i s closely linked to its
ability to deepen regional integration, expand exports, improve the terms o f trade and the
quality and value o f its export products, and to work jointly with neighboring countries to
tackle shared development challenges and opportunities. The Bank’s support for regional
integration will be provided through both national and regional engagements.

C. World Bank Program to Support CAS Outcomes
56.
The CAS originally proposed to include some operations and AAA that were dropped,
following the first Review o f the Operations Committee, to keep the Bank’s program more
selective. This includes stand-alone lending operations in the social sectors and in mining and
energy. Other partners are present to provide support in the social sectors where the Bank is
reducing i t s direct support; and planned budget support and a proposed Sources o f Growth
operation could cover, inter alia, mining and energy investments andor reforms. The proposed
IDA allocation for the Agro-pastoral Export Promotion project was increased to ensure sufficient
resources to help Government respond to high food price issues in the medium-term.

1. CAS Pillar 1: Accelerating Sustainable Growth that i s Equitably Shared
PRSP Pillar 1: Achieve strong, diversijied and job-creating growth

57.
Under this CAS Pillar, the Bank will focus i t s assistance to Niger on supporting the key
sectors that drive growth and have the greatest potential for creating jobs, while also supporting
efforts to strengthen the business climate and regional and global commercial opportunities,
through a mix o f development policy operations, investment instruments, technical assistance
and non-financial services. Maintaining macroeconomic stability i s a prerequisite for ensuring
that growth i s equitably shared.
58.
Outcome: Maintain macroeconomic stability. During the CAS period, the Bank will
continue to support authorities in pursing and maintaining policies for a stable macroeconomic
environment, including consolidating fiscal performance and establishing an adequate mediumterm fiscal framework and the implementation o f the recommendations o f the PEMFAR. Policy
actions under the DPL series and a possible first PRSC planned for 2010 will include reforms to
further strengthen public financial management and procurement practices.
18

59.
Regional synergies. Continued implementation o f macroeconomic stability policies in
the context o f the WAEMU Convergence and Stability Pact will help reinforce credibility o f
Niger’s national policies and its overall macro-framework.
60.
Outcome: Strengthen competitiveness of supply chains. The Bank will promote reforms
and investment to promote high potential growth opportunities identified by the PRSP, notably in
the agro-pastoral and mining sectors, to expand and diversify the narrow economic base,
reducing the economy’s vulnerability to shocks. The Bank will also continue supporting
implementation o f the Rural Development Strategy through investment and budget support. The
Private Irrigation Project I1 will be extended through 2008 and new operations will include an
Agro-Pastoral Export Promotion and Irrigation Project, a Sources o f Growth Project with a focus
on private sector development, and DPL 3 for growth.
61.
The DPL series and PRSC 1 will continue the support for medium-term policy reforms
aimed at establishing an environment more conducive to investment and economic growth in
rural development and the private sector, promoting public-private partnerships in infrastructure;
supporting agri-business opportunities, and deepening the financial sector, while completing the
ongoing reforms in human development.
Regional synergies. Niger participates in the regional Niger Basin Water Resources
62.
Development project and the associated GEF-financed Reversing Land and Water Degradation
Trends in the Niger River Basin which are, respectively, strengthening the capacity o f the Niger
River Basin Authority and supporting the implementation o f a joint framework for the
sustainable development o f land and water resources o f the basin. The project i s increasing
irrigated agriculture through rehabilitation and extension o f small irrigation schemes in the
Tillaberi region and the rehabilitation o f the Aboka dam while also developing traditional
fisheries. Depending on IDA availability, Niger could also participate in the second phase o f the
West Africa Agriculture Productivity project promoting regional cooperation in agricultural
research to improve farming technologies for crops such as onions where i t has a comparative
advantage and would also benefit from the research efforts undertaken by other countries (i.e
Senegal on cereals, M a l i on rice).

63.
Agriculture and irrigation partnerships. The Bank is working closely and in a
complementary manner with France, Germany, Denmark, EU, AfDB and the Islamic
Development Bank to support the implementation o f Niger’s Rural Development Strategy.
Special attention i s paid to rural infrastructure, including irrigation, sustainable land and water
resources management, market access and value chain development.
64.
Outcome: Strengthen sustainable management of natural resources. The ongoing
Community Action Program (PAC) supports sustainable natural resource management and
access to services at the local level by financing development plans prepared by communities
and local government. The project i s building capacity for the decentralized management of
funds for health, education, natural resources management, agricultural services, rural works,
mainstreaming climate risks and monitoring the eco-system. A second phase o f the P A C (an
APL) will be financed by IDA and GEF during the CAS. The PAC, GEF and the Carbon trust
fund are also supporting micro-projects wherein local communities work to manage and
conserve the eco-systems. A Japanese Trust Fund is financing community acacia nurseries. The
19

acacia tree not only helps reclaim degraded lands, sequester carbon and limits erosion but will
also generate income through the sale o f gum and carbon credits. The Private Irrigation
Promotion Project i s helping small farmers increase the production o f high-value irrigated crops,
using low-cost technology.
65.
Building on the work initiated by TerrAfrica, including a public expenditure review o f
the rural sector with a focus o n sustainable land management (2007)’ and support to harmonize
natural resources management plans under the Rural Development Strategy, the Bank will
provide technical advisory services for a programmatic approach to scale-up sustainable land and
water management in Niger. An impact evaluation o f investments made in sustainable land
management is being prepared and will be delivered in early FY09. In addition, a new analytical
task looking at land management and productivity, vulnerabilities, and climate risk will be
undertaken.
66.
Regional synergies. The Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends in the Niger
River Basin Project, and the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable
Ecosystems Management Program also support these efforts. In fact, these two operations aim to
help riparian countries collaborate in restoring and better managing watersheds and promoting
sustainable fishing practices.
Outcome: Strengthen the investment climate and support entrepreneurship. The Bank
67.
will support these outcomes through policy actions to be implemented in the context o f DPL I11
for Growth, a Sources o f GrowtWPSD project and the first PRSC. The Bank will also continue to
assist Niger in expanding and deepening the financial sector by reducing costs and increasing
access to credit under the ongoing Financial Sector TA operation. The C E M and Investment
Climate Assessments (ICAs) prepared in 2006 have provided the analytical underpinning for the
CAS priorities to strengthen the investment climate and support entrepreneurship. To hrther
deepen the knowledge base o n sources o f growth and support the design o f new operations, the
Bank i s preparing a trade diagnostic survey and an irrigation development study in 2008, a
review o f the political economy o f the mining sector in FY09 and a skills development study in
FY10.
Regional synergies. The ongoing T e r r A f i c a support for sustainable land management in
68.
Niger i s part o f a broader regional effort directly linked to the NEPAD Agriculture and
Environment programs. Niger will also benefit from the deepening o f the regional financial
market that i s supported by the WAEMU Capital Market Development Project.

PRSP Pillar 5: Endow the country with economic infrastructure to promote growth and
improve access to social services

69.
Outcomes: Strengthen economic infrastructure to promote growth, access to services
and regional integration. For investments in economic growth opportunities (agro-pastoral and
mining exports) to bear h i t , new investment in economic infrastructure i s essential. A Transport
Sector Program Support Project approved in FY08 will improve the road infrastructure which
l i n k s Niger’s market to the outside world and reduce transport costs, giving producers better
20

access to markets while creating jobs. Developing strong maintenance capacity i s also a project
goal.
70.
Regional synergies. The Government o f Niger i s eager to collaborate with neighboring
countries to develop regional solutions to its infrastructures development challenges to maximize
efficiency and effectiveness. The Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable
Ecosystems Management Program i s supporting the rehabilitation o f Kainji and Jebba
hydropower plants in Nigeria which will supply Niger with l o w cost energy. Another example
would be if Niger participates in the WAEMU Capital Markets Development project, which
would provide a line o f credit to improve the Niamey-Ouallam interstate road (contingent on
IDA availability) to improve access to the port o f Cotonou.
7 1.
Infrastructure partnerships. The Bank support for transport sector includes several key
financing partners: the EU, B O A D and Arab Funds.

2. CAS Pillar 11: Developing Human Capital through Equal Access to Quality Social
Services
PRSP Pillar 2: Equitable Access to Quality Social Services

72.
Strengthening human capital is an integral part of any growth strategy, and Niger will
require continued support in education and health services to improve outcomes and reach the
MDGs. The Bank will continue to support access to basic education and improved quality o f
teaching; expanded coverage o f basic health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and
provide technical input for better targeting o f social protection to the most vulnerable groups,
through a mix o f financial and analytical support.
73.
Outcome: Increased access to basic education and improved quality. The Bank will
continue to support improved access to primary education through the on-going Basic Education
Project (PADEB) and management o f the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative (Netherlands
Trust Fund). These initiatives, which are aligned with the Government’s ten year education
program (2003-1 3), are helping to build more durable classrooms, provide instructional
materials, and train teachers. Special emphasis i s placed on promoting girls’ participation in
school and parents and communities in children’s education. During the CAS, the Bank’s
analytical work in the education sector will consist o f a study on skills development to provide a
comprehensive review o f education and skills needed to create jobs and promote the private
sector. This analytical work would be followed by an Education Enhancement and Skills
Development Project.
74.
Regional synergies. In the past, Niger has hosted-and continues to host-a number o f
regional schools in the areas o f meteorology, agricultural research, mining and geology. Niger i s
also actively participating in the activities o f other regional schools in Senegal (livestock) or
Burkina Faso (Water, Public Finance). In the context o f the study on skills development, the
Bank will explore with the Government the development o f regional initiatives for prioritized
skills at different locations in the region.

21

75.
Education partnerships. In partnership with France, Germany, USA, Denmark, Belgium,
UK, EU, and UNICEF, the Bank will help Niger formulate and implement a holistic education
strategy with special emphasis on post primary in order to support skills development,
competitiveness and employment.
76.
Outcomes: Improved access of the rural population to basic health and nutrition
services and improved coverage and use of HIVprevention services and treatment. The
ongoing national health strategy aims at addressing current constraints on both the supply and
demand sides as well as improving accessibility, effectiveness, efficiency, quality and
sustainability o f health services, including in remote areas. These objectives have been fully
taken into consideration into ongoing sector investment operations including the Institutional
Strengthening and Health Sector Support Program (ISHSSP) and Multi-Sector H I V / A I D S
Program (MAP). Similarly, in the context o f limited resources, additional evidence o f adequate
funding should be provided by the Government regarding the decision o f removing user fees for
some reproductive and preventive services. More understanding is needed o n how to enhance
the effectiveness o f the health system as one that i s geared towards changing the health
indicators by means o f a community-based health and nutrition strategy that takes into account
the implementation and management capacity o f all potential actors and its implications for the
institutional arrangements and development. N o new investment operation in the health sector i s
planned during the CAS period. Given that the ISHSSP was recently approved (FY06) and i s
largely undisbursed (nearly $30 million), it will be implemented over the CAS period, as will the
MAP. Other donors are also present in the sector and the Bank will continue to support the sector
through policy dialogue.

77.
Health partnerships. The Bank has a long history o f involvement in the health sector in
Niger, and has coordinated closely with other development partners in the health sector. The
ISHSSP is jointly supported by IDA and AFD. Along with the MAP, the sector will be assessed
prior to and during the CAS mid-term review with a view to expanding the partnership and, if
necessary, the financial support to the sector.
78.
Outcome: Increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation. For over seven years,
the Bank has been a prominent partner to Niger in the successful development o f the water and
sanitation sector. The Bank will continue to support the sector with a second IDA-financed
Water Sector Project in FY10. The project has significantly improved the overall management o f
the urban water sector sub-sector on the quality o f service delivery, efficiency o f operations and
cost recovery. But there is still much work to be done to: (i)
strengthen the fragile financial
consolidate private sector participation arrangements for the
equilibrium o f the sub-sector; (ii)
management o f rural water facilities, and (iii)
scale-up on-site sanitation programs based on
lessons learned from the ending project.
79.
Water sector partnerships: The African Development Bank, the European Investment
Bank and the West African Development Bank will provide possible co-financing to the Bank’s
planned support in the sector.
80.
Outcome: Increased access of urban residents to basic infrastructure services,
particularly in disadvantaged areas. Urban roads, markets and transit depots are all key
ingredients in getting agro-pastoral products to the local and international market. The Local
22

Urban Infrastructure Development Project being prepared in FY08 will finance urban
infrastructure such as roads, water supply, drainage works, markets and truck and bus transit
depots, contributing both to economic growth and to the quality o f urban life. The Project will
help build the capacity o f local government and stakeholders to plan, deliver, maintain and
oversee urban infrastructure and services, including the protection o f cultural assets.
PRSP Pillar 4: Reduce Inequalities and Strengthen Social Protection for Vulnerable Groups

81.
Outcomes: Gender inequity i s reduced, as evidenced by improved girls’ access to
education and health services, and an effective food security and social protection strategy is
in place. IDA health and education interventions discussed above include support to reduce
gender inequity. In addition, IDA financing will focus on reducing vulnerability (particularly in
the context o f food security and old age), helping groups who need special services (women,
urban youth, PLWA) or lack basic service access and providing shelter from natural disasters.
The Bank is preparing a Food Security and Social Safety Nets Study and a Review o f the
Pension System. The former will review food and nutrition security policies and programs and
outline an agenda for strengthening the existing system and developing a safety net system to
reduce household vulnerabilities to food crises. The latter will examine current pension systems
for both public and private sectors; propose a conceptual framework that could guide discussions
about eventual reforms.

82.
Outcome: Government and farmers are better prepared to deal with natural disasters.
In lending, the on-going Map, Africa Emergency Locust Project and additional financing o f the
P A C to Mitigate Avian Influenza will help institutions and communities be better prepared for
these emergencies, mitigating eventual impact on the most vulnerable.

Cross-Cutting Challenges and Bank Support

3. Addressing Demographic Issues
PRSP Pillar 3: Slow down population growth

83.
Outcome: Increased awareness of and access to family planning. The government has
committed i t s e l f to tackling the issue, with Bank and donor support. The Bank’s Multi-sector
Demographic Program (PRODEM), approved in June 2007, will provide financing to build the
capacity o f the recently established Ministry o f Population and Social Reform to coordinate a
nationwide multi-sector population program, raise women’s awareness and adoption o f
contraception, promote reproductive health and work for cultural change. K e y Bank operations,
including budget support and investment lending, will address the demographic dimension in
their design and implementation.

23

Box 2: Niger’s Demographic Challenge
Niger’s rapid population growth i s due to a rapidly declining mortality rate for infants and chldren and a
high fertility rate. Girls marry young and they have l i t t l e choice in reproductive decisions. At today’s rate, the
population o f 14 million could double in 21 years. Even if fertility rates were to decline to 3.8 children per woman
by around 2050, the population would reach 53 million by 2050, according to the UN.
The Government o f Niger i s fully aware o f the demographic challenge and created a new Ministry o f
Population and Social Reform to coordinate a multi-sector approach to the issues. In February 2007, Niger has also
adopted a sound new population policy, the Declaration o f the Government o n Population Policy (DGPP). An IDA
grant was approved in 2007 to finance a Multi-sector Demographic Project (PRODEM). T h e major challenges in
t h i s area are weak capacity and lack o f coordination across sector ministries, advocacy and public awareness. Some
concrete results have already been obtained under the project, including the launching o f national public awareness
campaigns and the convening o f a National Forum on Population, Development, and Gender in February 2008.

4. Promoting Good Governance and Fighting Corruption
PRSP Pillar 6: Promoting high quality governance

84.
Outcome. Strengthened economic governance and capacity to implement and monitor
reforms. This agenda will include the following:

PEMFAR and Procurement. Support for continued implementation o f PEMFAR
recommendations and preparation o f a PEWEMFAR I1 in FY09; and support for public
procurement, including to ensure the staffing and operations o f the General Directorate;
strengthen procurement capacity in the l i n e ministries; and establish operational guidelines for
the procurement code. Analytical support will take into account the UEMOA regional directives
for harmonizing procurement procedures and guidelines in the sub-region. PEMFAR and
procurement activities in Niger are monitored as part o f the Bank’s Capacity Development
Management Plan (CDMAP).
0

Corporate Financial Reporting. A Report on Observance o f Standards and Codes in
Accounting and Auditing i s being prepared. The objective i s the adoption o f internationally
recognized standards o f accounting and auditing. An Action Plan will be developed to address
the most urgent deficiencies in corporate accounting.
0

Support for Anti-Corruption efforts. The Bank’s assistance to fight corruption in Niger
includes: (i)building capable, transparent and accountable institutions and (ii)
minimizing risks
to Bank-funded projects by assessing corruption risks to projects upstream, actively investigating
allegations o f fraud and corruption, and strengthening project oversight and supervision.
0

Improved governance and transparency in the management of the mining sector will
help ensure that the sector contributes to growth andpoverty reduction. Mining issues need to
be well managed as they are also at the center o f conflict and tensions. The Bank will build upon
the support for EITI to help government address the upstream and downstream mining sector
issues (under the EITI ++ agenda) and will prepare a study on the political economy o f mining to
strengthen the knowledge base and help define future support in the sector. The Bank has already
been supporting the EITI process in Niger since the adhesion o f the country to the EITI
principles and criteria in March 2005. The Bank is assessing the possibility o f mobilizing an
EITI grant to Niger from the multi-donor EITI trust fund to support EITI implementation.
0

Strengthening capacity for implementing reforms and programs. Faced with an
important reform agenda, and based on the lessons from the past, Government must improve
0

24

implementation capacity across the board. The C A S proposes a Reform Management Technical
Assistance Project focusing on staff and professional skills development, providing a
comprehensive program o f professional upgrading o f all staff o f the ministry in charge o f
economy and finance. The project will contribute to the C D M A P objective o f strengthening
capacity for public services delivery. IDA operations also include capacity-building components
for implementing entities.
0
Monitoring the PRSP. PRSP I1recognizes the urgency o f building capacity in M&E and
the need to design robust indicators and improve quantitative and qualitative analysis to better
inform key decision-makers and citizens on implementation progress. Government has taken
important steps to reinforce the capacity o f the statistical services.

85.
Governance and capacity building partnerships. The PEMFAR is jointly supported by
the Bank, IMF, UNDP EU, France, Germany, Denmark and Belgium. France and Germany are
also supporting an initiative to strengthen Niger’s natural resources management through EITI.

D. Delivering the Bank’s Program
87.

The Bank’s ability to deliver theproposedfinancing assistance will depend on the level
of available IDA resources. Determining factors are: (i)
Country’s performance as assessed
annually by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and the Annual Report on

Portfolio Performance; (ii)
Country performance relative to other IDA countries; and (iii)
the
DA-15 replenishment amount and the number o f IDA-eligible countries. Since the IDA
allocation process has not yet been completed, the indicative annual IDA envelope during the
CAS period i s estimated at around US$90 million equivalent (SDR 57 million). This allocation i s
based on FY08 IDA resources, net o f and on the 2007 D S A which suggests moderate risk o f debt
distress, as in 2006. The FY 2009 and beyond IDA program presented in table 6 has been
slightly increased, in anticipation that additional resources may become available in the context
o f IDA1 15. If no additional resources are available in FY09, the country team will adjust the
program accordingly. In FY08, Niger received 50 percent o f its IDA allocation on grant terms
and 50 percent on credit terms and this is the expectation for FY09.

88.
Lending instruments. In the spirit o f harmonization and selectivity, the lending portfolio
will increasingly move toward a programmatic approach, including through SWAPS and
DPLsPRSCs. Three existing muti-donor program already form an important part o f the portfolio
(education, health and water). In water and urban infrastructures, two new coordinated programs
have just emerged.
89.

The CASproposes that any reduction in the IDA allocation be offset by reducing the
financing of budget support operations. By creating additional fiscal space, HIPC and MDRI
debt r e l i e f help off-set any reductions in budget support. Alternatively, investment operations
could be reduced in size or delayed. Incremental additional resources that may become available
would be used to top up investment and regional operations or, if warranted, to alleviate external
shocks. To leverage IDA lending, the Bank will seek to design Bank projects with parallel or cofinancing with donor and/or private participation, especially in the sustainable development and

human development sectors. The CAS also proposes to explore access to additional hnding
through scaled-up initiatives in the Africa region, depending o n financing needs and absorptive
capacity.

E. Portfolio and Financial Management

91.
Portfolio Management and Fiduciary Issues. As o f April 10, 2008, the portfolio
comprised eleven active projects, financed by IDA and GEF and representing commitments o f
$325 million, with an undisbursed balance of US$127 million. O f these active commitments,
$157 million (49 percent) are IDA and GEF grants and $167 million (51 percent) are IDA
credits. IDA has committed some $30 million of financing to Niger through regional projects,
including the Africa Emergency Locust Project; Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends
in the Niger River Basin Project; and the Niger Basin Water Resources Development and
Sustainable Ecosystems Management Program.
28

92.

Financial management has been assessed as “overall satisfactory” for 82 percent of
the portfolio, with the remaining 18 percent rated “moderately satisfactory.” FY07 audit reports
on both IDA and trust finds were satisfactory and full compliant with Bank prescribed auditing
procedures. For the most part, line ministries are the implementing agencies for IDA financed
projects and the Bank will work with line ministry departments responsible for financial

management o f Bank operations to strengthen their capacity and ensure full compliance with
fiduciary standards and fully satisfactory audit reports. The main implementing agencies for the
second phase o f the Community Action Program are communes and related communities. The
Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Support Program, uses a sector wide approach
(SWAP) with report-based disbursements associated with pooled donor finds.

93.
Implementation of Financial Management simplification and modernization measures
enable
made to the Bank’s FM operational policies and procedures will be encouraged to (i)
design o f project FM arrangements that are simpler and more responsive to Niger’s needs,
(ii)
facilitate capacity building, and (iii)
reduce costs for Niger and the Bank. The areas o f these
major changes are as follows: Interim Financial Reports (IFRs), Audit Reports,
ExpendituresDisbursement Categories, Use o f Country FM systems, Portfolio-level FM
activities, Readiness for Implementation and Conditions o f Effectiveness.

v. PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTICIPATION
A. BankGroup
94.
The International Finance Corporation. IFC’s operations in Niger mainly focus on: (i)
improving and enhancing the business environment and investment climate; (ii)
building up the
capacity o f micro small and medium enterprises and expanding financing support to them; (iii)
private provision for infrastructure projects; and (iv) developing proactively projects in the
financial and key priority sectors. A high priority for IFC is to provide technical assistance
support for the implementation o f reforms identified by FIAS and the 2006 ICA, with the
involvement o f PEP Africa.
95.
IFC’s Board in April 2008 approved an investment in Marina Market Niger, as part o f the
financing o f the Marina Market Group. I F C is actively exploring other investment opportunities
in Niger and has identified agriculture as a sector with promising prospects. I F C i s seeking to
actively support financial intermediaries sector with specific program to enhance small and
medium enterprise lending as well as trade finance activity.

Niger i s a signatory o f the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and i s keen to
proceed with the deepening o f the harmonization process. I t convened a meeting on aid
coordination and donor harmonization in March 2006 and a workshop on improving efficiency
o f external aid in September 2007. The Bank and U N D P co-chair the Development Assistance
Group (DAG), the main forum for donor coordination in Niger, with the participation o f about
15 bilateral and multilateral agencies. Under the DAG, efforts are underway to make strong
progress o n the implementation o f commitments in the Paris Declaration
99.
M u c h o f the collective effort i s focused on hrthering harmonization through initiatives to
promote dialogue or support programs in critical sectors for Niger development agenda. K e y
donors supported the preparation o f sector strategies in education, health, rural development and
transport and co-financed the multi-year investment programs in health and education.
C. CAS Consultations

100. As an input for the preparation o f the CAS, the Bank visited all the Regions o f Niger and
met with various groups including the public administration, private sector, civil society,
academicians, students and development partners to discuss the strategic directions o f the CAS.

101, Annex 12 provides a summary o f the outcome o f consultations, which confirmed that the
Bank’s focus on growth and human capital development while treating governance, population
dynamic, vulnerability and regional integration dimensions as transversal themes was
appropriate and these interventions are in full alignment with the PRSP. In addition,
approximately 600 stakeholders were invited to provide their opinion on the Bank’s assistance to
Niger by participating in a client survey in 2007.

VI. MONITORING
AND EVALUATING
CAS PERFORMANCEAND RESULTS
102. Managingfor Results. The Bank’s objective i s to contribute to Niger’s higher order
goals as outlined in PRSP 11. However, the Bank’s performance will be measured according to
results obtainable during the CAS period, mostly influenced by on-going operations or those
prepared within the first two years o f the CAS period. Annex 1 provides the results matrix with
the specific outcomes the Bank expects to influence through ongoing and planned operations and
analytical work.
103. The Bank will apply i t s own M&E tool kit in Niger. Under the CAS, regular PERs, using
infomation from PETS in key PRSP sectors, will provide feedback o n the effectiveness o f
targeted expenditures, identifying any bottlenecks in the flow o f funds, including any eventual
misappropriations. Country Portfolio Performance Reviews will provide a forum for raising
policy and implementation issues to the attention o f the PRSP Steering Committee. The Bank’s
Implementation Supervision Reports are an important tool for M&E. Experienced sector
specialists and task team leaders also provide important qualitative information for M&E.
Finally, internationally recognized instruments such as the OECD-sponsored learning
achievement tests-and
similar objective instruments in the health sector-can
provide
important diagnostic feedback, enabling changes in strategy and practice. Finally, the CAS
Results Framework will be used to track intermediate indicators and measure progress toward
higher level outcomes. A CAS Progress Report will be prepared in FYlO and a CAS
Completion Report in FY12.

VII. R I S K S AND MITIGATION
MEASURES
104. Although Niger seems to have overcome past political instability and has made
substantial progress in macroeconomic management, some risks remain for implementing the
CAS program. This CAS incorporates measures to mitigate the following country and Bank
program risks.

105. Conflict and security risks. Insecurity in the northern region o f the country, linked to the
a rebel group demanding a greater share o f the region’s mineral wealth, has impacted the local
economy and delayed implementation o f Bank programs in affected areas. The Bank’s support
for EITI and EITI++ should contribute to reducing tensions in the medium-term by increasing
transparency and accountability in the management o f mining resources while also building the
government’s capacity to better manage abundant mineral resources. The Bank also seeks to
mitigate risks associated with conflict over minerals by strengthening knowledge o f the political
economy o f mining.
106. Political risks. Municipal, legislative and presidential elections are planned in 2009,
creating a risk o f reform paralysis during the campaigning and election cycle. The Bank will
work closely with the authorities and development partners to support continued implementation
o f the government’s reform program during this period, particularly to stay o n track with public
expenditure management and to maintain close collaboration with government and the
confidence o f donors. The Bank will also consult regularly with civil society and other
31

stakeholders to raise awareness o f reforms supported by the CAS. This will be important for
ensuring continued support o f these reforms by a new government.
107. Exogenous shocks and commodity price risks. Mineral revenues can be volatile and
destabilize the macroeconomic framework and implementation o f reforms supported by the
Bank. Alternatively, continued high uranium prices, if not managed properly, could result in
Dutch Disease with negative effects o n agriculture. Drought, locust infestation and other
exogenous shocks could reduce staple food stocks, leading to food insecurity. The CAS supports
diversification o f Niger’s economy to reduce vulnerability to such shocks and the impact o n
Bank programs.
108. Food security and inflation risks. Rises in international food prices and increased
demand for cereals in neighboring Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Benin have led to sharp increases
in food prices in Niger. Food prices increased by 15.5 percent in March 2008 compared to the
previous year; o f which cereals prices increased by about 25 percent. This could affect the
portfolio as projects may be restructured to respond to the crisis or could delay the reform
program supported by the Bank and other donors. There i s some flexibility in upcoming projects
already focused on the agricultural sector as well as in planned budget support to help respond to
such crises. IDA will also be working with the IMF to help Government design and implement
fiscal relief measures that do not jeopardize the macro-framework.

Introduction

1.
This document reviews the experience implementing IDA’SCountry Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Niger, dated January 21, 2003 (Report No. 25203-NIR) which
covered fiscal years 2003-2005. The draft o f this Report was completed in March 2006,
and was updated in November 2007 to incorporate developments affecting CAS
outcomes and Bank Group activities in FY06-07. Progress in achieving the goals o f the
2003 CAS i s summarized in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 compare the lending and nonlending support through FY07.

2.
Niger i s one o f the world’s poorest countries, and i t s prospects are constrained by
a lack o f natural resources, an economy susceptible to external shocks, principally
weather-related, high population growth, and l o w human and institutional capacity. After
decades o f decline, GDP per capita stabilized at about US$200 after the 1994 devaluation
o f the C F A franc. Niger did not benefit to the same extent as i t s neighbors from the
devaluation because o f i t s isolation from world markets, although this isolation has
shielded i t from instability in neighboring Nigeria and Cote d’Ivoire, i t s main trading
partners. Niger’s prospects have also been affected by political instability and poor
governance during the decade o f the nineties, including two successive coups d’etat in
1996 and 1999. In December 1999, the military junta governing the country handed
power to a civilian government following presidential and legislative elections. The
elected government began “first generation” structural reforms, and prepared the first
PRSP which was translated into a medium-term reform program. Since 2000, two
successive governments have reestablished confidence and improved governance.
Presidential/ legislative elections in December 2004 led to the first peaceful government
transition in more than a decade; local elections in July 2004 represented a step towards
political decentralization. In October 2007, the Government approved a second PRSP
covering the period 2008-2012.
42

3.
During the CAS period, the Bank provided financial support amounting to
US$219.7 million which i s slightly below the programmed amount o f US$238 million;
carried out considerable economic and sector work while at the same time improving
coordination with donors. In FY06-07, IDA provided financial support amounting to
US$l55 million. In addition, an Investment Climate Assessment planned for the CAS
period was completed and analytical work on sources o f growth and rural development
was carried out. This report concludes that the FY03-05 CAS was relevant to the
country’s needs and an important element in advancing the Government’s program, in
some measure because stabilization which the Bank supported was a key element o f the
program. The findings confirm that political stability and improvements in governance
are closely linked to success in economic reforms. I t also highlights the reality that given
Niger’s constraints, reforms need to be particularly ambitious and sustained, and require
determination from its political leadership to overcome inertia and vested interests.
B.

L o w e r T e r m Stratepic Goals

4.
The 2003 CAS aimed to support the Government’s long term strategic goals,
enunciated in i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy o f December 2001 (Report No. 23483-NIR).
On the macroeconomic front, the Government’s objectives included increasing annual
GDP growth to 4 percent and other ambitious targets such as reducing poverty headcount
index from 65 to 59 percent. The PRS set forth a national development program centered
o n four pillars, but also aimed to address cross-cutting issues o f gender, governance and
stakeholder participation. The four PRSP pillars were:

0

Putting in place a macroeconomic framework which ensures economic and
financial stability while promoting sustainable and robust growth;
Developing the productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate
vulnerability and stimulate income generation;
Improving the access o f the poor to quality social services, and
Strengthening o f institutional and individual capacity within and outside
government, at the central and local level.

5.
The PRSP was discussed by the Bank and IMF Boards in February 2002. The
PRSP agenda was broad and imprecise in a number o f areas; this i s understandable as it
was prepared after a long period o f political difficulties when there was limited
analytical work. Given the circumstances, the PRSP was viewed by the Bank and the
Fund as a credible framework for implementation o f a poverty reduction strategy. The
CAS was designed to support the implementation o f the PRSP.
6.
The PRSP was broadly consistent with the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) although its numerical targets were below the MDGs for 2015. The CAS noted
that this was in line with the MDG concept, which recognizes that MDGs need to be
adapted to country specific circumstances. The CAS noted that the shortfall was not a
lack o f commitment in the part o f the Government, but recognition o f the country’s
constraints.
43

C.

CAS Outcomes

7.
The CAS aimed to help Niger achieve i t s long t e r m objectives by selectively
supporting reforms and expenditure programs in key sectors under all pillars. The CAS
noted that debt sustainability largely determined lending levels given the fragility o f
Niger’s external financing situation, even after HIPC delivery, and indicated correctly
that Niger would require sustained high levels o f aid, mostly on grant terms, if i t was to
achieve i t s PRSP objectives. IDA financial support would be a blend o f credits and
grants. The Bank program would be determined by the Bank’s comparative advantage in
some areas, and by the lending constraints imposed by the debt sustainability problem.
Grants represented some 40 percent o f total assistance in FY03-05; 45 percent in FY06
and 100 percent in FY07.
1.

CAS Objectives

8.
The CAS noted that Bank assistance would seek to enhance national ownership o f
programs associated with the PRSP. The Strategy aimed to help the Government move
progressively to programmatic lending which was viewed by the Government and the
Bank as the best way o f meeting PRSP objectives, as it allowed the scaling up o f povertyreducing programs. The CAS also aimed to build the government’s capacity to plan and
manage development programs and to foster collaboration among donors, which were
key elements in the transition to programmatic lending.

9.
The Bank would support reforms in cross-cutting policy themes highlighted in the
PRSP (gender, governance and stakeholder participation). The CAS did not present
specific CAS objectives, and instead discussed the Bank program in support the four
PRSP pillars and gave benchmarks to monitor progress.
10.

Specifically, the Bank program would:

Ensure economic/financial stability while promoting growth (PRSP Pillar 1)
a.
through:
0
Improvements in public financial and fiduciary management and fiduciary
controls by addressing capacity shortages in planning and implementing
programs. Benchmarks to measure progress in this area were (i)
an improved
primary fiscal balance to generate savings; (ii)
government arrears to remain
stable and (iii)
improved debt service with the net present value (NPV) o f debt-toexport ratio below 200 percent.
0
Supporting privatization o f state-owned enterprises, particularly the utilities,
and improving the environment for private sector investment. Benchmarks to
monitor progress were (i)the privatization o f the petroleum distribution
(SONIDEP) and electricity (NIGELEC) companies, and (ii)
the establishment o f a
multisectoral regulatory agency.
0
Reforming and developing the financial sector including restructuring o f stateowned banks, and strengthening financial institutions to expand SME financing.
44

Benchmarks measuring progress related to the restructuring, privatization andor
liquidation o f remaining state-controlled banks.

b. Develop the productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability
and stimulate income generation (PRSP Pillar 2) through:
0
Improvements in rural production and income-generating activity and
addressing environmental degradation by, among others, expanding irrigated
agriculture. Rapid environmental degradation was to be addressed through
integration o f best practices in a Community Development Program. Benchmarks
measuring progress in this area were: (i)
the development and implementation o f a
comprehensive rural development strategy; and (ii)
increased access to irrigation.
c. Improve access o f the poor to' quality social services (PRSP Pillar 3) by:
0
Making primary education accessible to all. Progress benchmarks were: the (i)
establishment o f annual education program budgets, and (ii)
building a multidonor framework to finance program budgets.
0
Making health care accessible to the poor. Benchmarks were: (i)
to put in place
performance-based management systems for decentralized health care provision
and (ii)
the adoption o f a health policy that facilitated access to the poorest.
Addressing population issues. The progress benchmark was to prepare a
0
population policy to be reflected in PRSP I1
Intensifying the fight against HIV/ALDS. The progress benchmark was the
establishment o f H I V / A I D S preventive and post-diagnosis services.

11.
The CAS properly focused on debt sustainability and by so doing doubtlessly
helped Niger obtain much-needed HIPC resources which expanded the fiscal space and
enabled the Government to increase expenditures in the social sectors. The CAS focus on
the PRSP and i t s link with MDG encouraged other donors to align their programs to the
government program, notably in the areas o f public finance, health and education. Even
though CAS activities were expected to be selective, in fact, the Bank program covered a
wide range o f activities, probably reflecting the difficulties o f establishing priorities in a
country with Niger's needs, and also the very broad scope o f the PRSP.
The CAS objectives and program reflect the relative strength o f the economic and
12.
sectoral work that informed the CAS. Strengthening public finance management was
central to improved economic governance, a requirement for the budgetary support
required by Niger, and the CAS objectives in the area o f public finance were clear. The
importance o f privatization and financial sector reform on macroeconomic stability and
in poverty reduction were not spelled out. A clearer rationale for IDA involvement in this
area might have helped advance the discussions with Government on the reform program.
The objectives in the socioeconomic pillar, focusing on education and health, were broad
and ambitious, but clear. The objectives in the productive sector pillar were generic: the
reliance on agriculture growth and the underlying argument that agriculture has to grow
because a large percentage o f the population lives in the rural areas i s not especially
persuasive, and the CAS did not make the case that rapid productivity gains or the
45

expansion o f land under cultivation were possible. Environmental issues were not
specifically addressed.
13.
The CAS identified core monitoring benchmarks which were directly derived
from the PRSP pillars (Table 9 in the CAS). In addition, i t identified a number o f PRSP
indicators which would be monitored during CAS implementation, and which were
included in a Country Partnership Strategy Matrix attached to the C A S (base year 2000).
Monitoring CAS progress is discussed in section A. 3 below. The CAS monitoring
benchmarks and the Country Partnership Indicators are reproduced in Table 1.
14.
The CAS recognized that implementation o f the reform program required a major
capacity-building effort, but the CAS did not discuss how the Bank program was to
strengthen capacities. In retrospect, the Bank program probably made important
contributions in this area, as most projects included training and capacity building
activities and non-lending activities were carried out with local participation which
implicitly entailed substantial training. Nonetheless, an explicit program would
contribute to a more effective effort.

2.

Progress towards‘CAS Objectives

15.
Niger made progress towards i t s PRSP goals” and an important number o f CAS
benchmarks were met, but performance over the past five years highlights the structural
nature o f the constraints to social and economic progress. Progress towards the CAS
objectives in each o f the CASPRSP pillars and the instruments used by the Bank are
discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

PRSP Pillar 1: Macroeconomic Stability and Growth
16.
Progress. Macroeconomic performance improved substantially since 2000 and
most macroeconomic stability and growth monitoring benchmarks set in the CAS were
met. Real GDP grew at an average annual rate o f 4.3 percent in the 2001-2006,
compared to the 4 percent projected in the CAS and PRSP. This was despite an
unfavorable environment resulting from the recurrence o f domestic and regional sociopolitical tensions, difficulties in obtaining adequate external assistance and a drought and
locust plague in 2004 that severely affected agricultural production. The generally
positive performance since 2000 reflects mostly favorable weather conditions and the
impact o f measures to promote growth, including improvements in fiscal management
and increases in capital expenditures on infrastructure. This improved macroeconomic
environment and increased investor and consumer confidence i s reflected in the increase

l5Information for this section i s drawn from the Public ExpenditureReform Credit Program Document; the ICR for the
Second Public Expenditure Adjustment Program and for the projects that closed during the period; the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR); the Joint Staff Advisory Notes on the

Second Rural and Social Reform Programs; the Project Appraisal Documents for the investment projects approved

in private investment: the share o f private investment in GDP tripled during the period,
from 4.8 percent o f GDP in 2000-01 to 14.4 percent in 2005-06.

17.
In 2004, the combination o f a severe drought and locust attacks reduced GDP
growth to -0.8 percent, highlighting the vulnerability o f the economy to climatic changes.
The drought caused a severe food shortage that affected a quarter o f the population.
Spurred by favorable weather conditions and investment in the mining,
telecommunications and infrastructure, growth rebounded in 2005-07 averaging 6.1
percent during the period.
18.
Inflation declined from an average annual rate o f 4.7 percent in 2000-01 to an
average o f 2.7 percent in 2004-06, below the 3 percent target in the PRSP and the CAS.
This was largely the result o f sound fiscal policies and better output growth performance
and despite the increase in o i l prices and the 2004 drought which led to a spike in
agricultural prices. In 2006, Niger was the only country within the Union West African
Monetary U n i o n (WAEMU) to meet all first order convergence criteria.
19.
The implementation o f structural measures to strengthen public finance led to
improvements in the macroeconomic framework, in line with CAS objectives. Revenue
increased from 9.3 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 11.4 percent in 2005-06 and government
expenditures increased from an average o f about 17 percent o f GDP in 2000-01 to 19.7
percent in 2005-06. During the same period, current expenditures declined by 1.7
percentage points o f GDP to an average o f 9.3 percent in 2005-06 while capital
expenditures increased by about 3.4 percentage points, to an average 9.9 percent o f GDP
in 2005-06. The basic budget deficit l6stood at -2.8 o f GDP in 2005 and -0.3 in 2006,
down from an average o f -3.2 percent o f GDP in 2000-01,
20.
Progress has been made in clearing domestic arrears, although the problem has
not been resolved: by the end o f 1999, outstanding internal arrears were estimated at
CFA.F 295.6 billion (24 percent o f 1999 GDP) o f which CFA.F 100.5 billion was cleared
by the end o f 2006. The stock o f arrears in 2006 (CFA.Fl95.2 billion) i s equivalent to 10
percent o f GDP.

Niger reached the completion point under the enhanced H P C Initiative in April
2004, which enabled i t to benefit from debt relief estimated at US$1.2 billion in nominal
terms or US$520.6 in NPV terms, and an additional exceptional assistance o f US$142.5
million. The stock o f external debt increased slightly from US$1,758 million in 2002
(80.7 yercent o f GDP) to an estimated US$1,949 million in 2005 (58.6 percent o f
GDP)' , The NPV o f debt to exports stood at 136 percent in 2005, which is below the
HIPC target o f 150 and well below the CAS target o f 200. The NPV o f debt to exports in
2007 stood at 87 in 2007. Analytical work on debt sustainability carried out in 2007
suggests that despite debt relief, most recently in 2006 through the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative, Niger remains at moderate risk o f debt distress in the medium to longterm. Niger has high external financing requirements and a narrow export base. Hence,
even though i t has acceptable levels o f public debt, export shocks, lower growth and less
generous financing terms than assumed in projections could plunge the country into debt
distress.
22.
The public finance reform program is based on a comprehensive Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Report (PEMFAR) prepared in
conjunction with the Government, the European Union and the African Development
Bank. The report presented a reform agenda to improve public finance management and
economic governance and was formally adopted by Decree in July 2005. The public
finance changes focused o n (i)
the budget preparation process; (ii)
budget execution and
cash management procedures; and (iii)improved management o f domestic debt.
Reforms in budget preparation included the elimination o f dual budget with the general
and investment budget presented in the same document since 2001; identification o f core
activities requiring protection from expenditure cuts; development o f multi-year
budgeting, including preparation o f multi-sectoral and sector-specific Medium Term
Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF); and the introduction o f program-budgeting starting
with basic education and health in 2003. In budget execution, the Government
introduced, among other measures, a Financial Management Information System (FMIS)
which has led to a computerization o f budgetary processes, and revamped the cash
management systems to protect priority allocations in favor o f the social sectors.
23.
Implementation o f the public finance reform agenda continued in 2006-07, with
measures to hrther strengthen (i)the government's cash management system; (ii)the
process o f budgetary allocations for priority sectors by, among others, adopting a code
that identifies pro-poor expenditures in the budget, and (iii)the monitoring o f
expenditures in education, health and the rural sector which represented 5 1 percent o f the
recurrent budget in 2006. The Government has also prepared a medium term expenditure
framework for the rural sector, and a program to modernize treasury operations i s being
put in place. In addition, measures are being taken to improve procedures and thus the
transparency o f public procurement. All public finance measures are expected to tighten
controls and improve economic governance.

Progress was mixed in the second area o f CAS concentration under the
macroeconomic/growth pillar, which focused on the privatization o f the petroleum and
electricity companies and the establishment o f a multisectoral regulatory agency,
measures which would have contributed to improving the environment for private sector
operations. The CAS was prepared at a time when there was an expectation that the
government divestiture program would move forward after reforms in the
telecommunications and water sectors (supported by a Privatization and Regulatory
Reform Project o f FY99 and a Water Sector Project o f FYO1). In telecommunications,
three cellular operators were licensed and the state company privatized. There has been a
significant improvement in services since liberalization, primarily in the cellular
operations and teledensity increased from 0.16 per 100 inhabitants in 1999 to 2.6 per 100
inhabitants in 2005, exceeding program targets. Performance o f the telecommunications
company has been less than expected and i t has not been able to meet i t s investment
targets. The water company was also privatized in 2001 and i s viewed as the most
successful divestiture in the country (progress in the water sector i s discussed in section
on Pillar 3 below).
25.
The CAS benchmark which called for the privatization o f SONIDEP (petroleum
distribution) and NIGELEC (electricity) was not met. However, the two companies were
brought to point o f sale, which i s the more typical requirement. When offered for sale,
there were no interested investors due to the international climate and country prospects,
problems which will need to be taken into account in designing the strategy for the
energy sector. The strategy to improve services in electricity and petroleum distribution i s
expected to be reviewed and revised. In hindsight, the Government and the Bank could
have moved more aggressively to redefine the sector strategy, when it became clear that
one focused on the sale o f the two companies was not viable. The Multisectoral
Regulation Agency, which was established in 1999, was fully staffed and operational (a
CAS benchmark) by 2003. The Implementation Completion Report o n the Privatization
and Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance Project (Report No. ICR0000425),
completed in FY07, notes that the Agency has gained credibility in the
telecommunications sector where i t has a clearly defined role in dispute resolution,
frequency management and licensing. The Agency has begun recovering costs from fees
for connections, and carried out studies o n licensing and telecommunications access.
26.
On the financial sector, the third area o f CAS concentration under the
macroeconomic/growth pillar, the CAS benchmarks relating to divestiture and
restructuring o f state-owned banks has been largely met. BINCI, the Islamic Bank, was
recapitalized without government participation and i s now a private bank. Divestiture o f
Credit du Niger (CDN), another state bank, was completed during the CAS period and
the divestiture o f the Housing Bank which was initiated during the CAS period should be
completed in the coming months. Lastly, the financial and postal activities o f the Post
Office have been split, and discussions are underway on ways to continue the financial
services to small savers provided by the Post Office.

49

The Bank Program. The CAS program in support o f the macroeconomic
27.
stability/growth pole called for one quick-disbursing operation per year (two public
expenditure adjustment credits and one in support o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy) and
a technical assistance operation i s support o f financial sector reform. Two adjustment
operations were approved, in FY03 and FY05 for a total o f US$lOS million, US$10
million under the amount originally programmed and 48 percent o f total lending to Niger
during the CAS period. Support for the macroeconomic stability/growth agenda
continued in FY06-07 with the approval o f two Rural and Social Policy Reform
operations for a total o f U S $ l O O million (the second in the form o f a grant) and
accounting for 62 percent o f FY06-07 financing.

The CAS also included substantial non-lending services in support for the
28.
macroeconomic/growth pillar. Planned assistance included support in PRS reporting and
to encourage donor coordination; a public expenditure management review; a country
procurement assessment; a development policy review, and private sector (investment
climate) and energy assessments. Work on the nonlending front was impressive. All
programmed activities in support o f the macroeconomic stability pillar were carried out.
Work in public finance, including the PEMFAR discussed above, was thorough and
doubtlessly helped build capacity in the country, laid the foundation for improved
governance which i s critical for budget support and helped coordinate donor support for
public expenditure reform. The investment climate and energy assessments were not
completed within the CAS period. The Investment Climate Assessment was completed in
FY06 and is being used as an input in the discussions on the growth agenda. In
recognition o f the difficulties faced in the growth area, a non-programmed informal study
on sources o f growth was carried out in 2004. This was followed by A Country Economic
Memorandum o n Accelerating Growth and Achieving the Millennium Development
Goals; Diagnosis and Policy Agenda, which was discussed with Government in FY07.
The energy assessment planned for the 2003 C A S period i s expected to be initiated in
FY08 along with a mining sector review.
PRSP Pillar 2: Develop Productive Sectors
29.
Progress. There was little progress in the introduction o f measures to help expand
productive activities during the CAS period, but as mentioned earlier, the focus o f the
CAS was not in this pillar. Emphasis began to be placed on analytical work to support
the productive sectors starting in FY05. The CAS benchmark relating to the preparation
o f a sector strategy was met. The economy remains heavily reliant on an agriculture
sector which is primarily subsistence and vulnerable to droughts and other natural
disasters. In spite o f impediments, food production kept track with population growth in
the two decades ending in 2003, and cash crop production increased following the CFAF
devaluation. These increases were possible through an extension o f the area under
cultivation, some o f which was unsuitable for cash crop production, and which led to a
decline in yields. Close to a quarter o f the population faced a food crisis in 2004 and
continues to rely on food relief. Expansion o f irrigated areas has been modest, and the
Bank’s agriculture portfolio has not performed well. The contribution o f agriculture to
GDP remained at 40 percent during the CAS implementation period.
50

30.
The CAS progress benchmark in the productive sector pillar was the formulation
and implementation o f a rural development strategy, and increased access to irrigation.
The strategy was adopted in 2003, reaffirming the rural sector as the engine o f growth
and setting broad objectives (improve rural population’s access to economic opportunities
/protect them against risks and improve food security; enhance capacities o f
public/private institutions).
31.
During the CAS period and in the years that preceded it, competencies o f public
agencies dealing with the rural sector deteriorated, which impacted the Government’s
ability to put in place the rural development strategy. It i s expected that this trend will be
reversed as focus is increasingly placed on rural development with the Rural and Social
Sector Programs supported by donors including the Bank in FY06 and FY07. In the
context o f those programs, the Rural Sector Strategy was translated into an investment
program and budgets, and a medium term expenditure program was prepared which
combines activities o f the four ministries involved. The program i s being implemented
and achievements monitored. In addition, administration o f services began to be
decentralized with the installation o f Regional Land Management Administration Offices.

32.
An Agro-Pastoral Export Promotion Project which was partly carried out during
the CAS period and closed in October 2005 had serious design and management
problems, and the Implementation Completion Report o f December 2006 rated the
outcome unsatisfactory and sustainability unlikely. Under the Community Development
Project, progress was made in establishing a framework for community based
development which can be replicated and the program has been extended. The irrigation
project had institutional and management problems for most o f i t s implementation period
and was restructured in 2007. As o f the end o f 2006, some 26 thousand farmers had
received matching grants designed to help them improve operations and adopt new
technologies, and there had been measurable increases in some yields in the project
intervention zones (50 percent for onions; 20 percent for tomatoes).
33.
Bank Program. The CAS did not include lending for the productive sectors in the
FY03-05 period, possibly because three operations were being implemented. The
Government received funding, not programmed, to help address the locust plague and
support under a regional program on Water Degradation on the Niger River Basin under
the Global Environment Facility. The CAS called for sector work on rural development
but a formal report was not prepared; a planned rural roads strategy was prepared. A
US$lO million supplemental credit for the Community Development Project was
prepared during the CAS period and approved in FY06.

34.
In FY06, analytical was started in connection with the Rural and Social Sector
budget support operations approved FY06 and FY07. Work was also started in FY07 on a
Rural Sector Public Expenditure Review which was completed in September 2007.

51

PRSP Pillar 3: Improve access ofpoor to quality social services
35.
Progress. Clear gains have been made in access to education and some
improvements in health service provision and the CAS benchmarks met. Progress in
human development indicators was affected by the rapid population growth and a major
success o f the Bank program has been the impact o f analytical work on population
problems, discussed below.
36.
In education, the Government prepared a ten year education program (20032013) and a program budget for 2005-07. Primary school enrollment rates increased
from about 27 percent in 1999-2000 to 54 percent in 2005-06, and unit costs o f education
have fallen. The share o f girls attending schools is also increasing, but the gap i s
continuing to widen between boys and girls, a problem which the Government is trying to
address. Improvements resulted from an ambitious program o f classroom construction
(with funds made available through HIPC) and the recruitment o f some 2700 contractual
teachers per year since 2001 whose unit costs are more than 50 percent lower than the
cost o f civil service teachers. A study carried out in 2004 shows that the recruitment o f
these teachers did not lower the quality o f primary education. In addition, completion
rates and survival rates, which reflect the system's internal efficiency, are improving.
Completion rates went up from 27 percent in 1999/00 to 34 percent in 2005/06 and 43
percent in 2006-07. Work on curriculum reform and teacher training to improve the
quality o f education i s ongoing, but these measures take time to show results. Education
reforms have continued to be put in place in FY06-07, including improvements in the
contractual teacher system under the Rural and Social reform Programs. A financial audit
carried out in June 2006 revealed mismanagement o f finds which other donors had
pulled to finance the education program; the Government took corrective action,
including the dismissal o f incriminated staff; measures designed to strengthen financial
controls in public sector agencies, which i s part o f the public finance agenda, are
expected to help avoid similar problems in the future.

'*

37.
Health coverage improved during the CAS period. The Government prepared a
Development Plan for 2005-2009, and a two year program budget, which were
benchmarks under the CAS. A performance-based management system for decentralized
health care provision, a CAS benchmark, began to be developed during the CAS period
and has now been put in place.
38.
Physical access to health care has expanded through construction and equiping o f
some 1000 health centers (with resources freed by HIPC). After an unsuccesshl attempt
in 2003, the Ministry o f Health began to recruit contract health workers in 2004. The
salaries offered to the new recruits are equivalent to the base salaries o f civil servants at
the beginning o f their career (less benefits), and as a result, the program will not reduce
unit costs as dramatically as in the basic education sector. However, i t is expected to

Ministres de I'Education des Pays ayant le Franqais en Partage.

52

address the shortage o f staff in the poorest regions o f the country. The slow progress in
health sector reforms during the CAS period reflects the complexity o f the sector,
although in hindsight, the Bank could have been more forceful in advancing the reform
agenda at the beginning o f the period.
39.
Starting in 2005, under the Rural and Social Policy Reform Programs, the
Government adopted the policy o f filly subsidizing k e y maternal and child care services
and included the expenses in the budget, increased the proportion o f the health budget
allocated to basic health services in the regions and districts; and prepared a national
health map to identify requirements.
40.
The 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy did not address population issues. The
Government i s now more aware o f the problems posed by rapid population growth and
the 2006 PRSP addresses more adequately the population issue (a CAS benchmark). The
development o f population policies and programs accelerated during the CAS period, in
some measure as a result o f analytical work carried out by the Bank, discussed below. In
2004, the Government established a new ministry charged with population and social
issues and in M a y 2005, issued a policy statement which was adopted by Parliament
emphasizing the need to address the problem o f population and reproductive health. In
August 2006, the Government presented an action-oriented Declaration o f Population
Policy (DGPP) covering the period 2007-2015 which updates the 1992 National
Population Policy, and which includes the objective o f reducing annual population
growth from 3.3 percent to 2.5 percent by 2015. A work plan is being prepared. A new
law on reproductive health was passed in M a y 2006 and the Government has adopted
legislation to provide free contraceptives in public health facilities. Implementation o f the
program remains difficult, as there continues to be resistance to Government
interventions in population and reproductive health and capacity remains an issue. In
parallel with changes in policy, some progress has been made in improving H I V / A I D S
services; the Africa-wide supported program has been changed to improve i t s
effectiveness (a CAS benchmark was the establishment o f HIV/AID preventive and postdiagnosis services).
Education and Health Indicators Reflecting CAS Objectives (percent)

41.
In water and sanitation, progress was made towards meeting PRSP objectives
included in the CAS o f improving the access and quality o f sanitation services (there
were no specific CAS benchmarks). With assistance from IDA through the Privatization
and Private Sector Reform Project o f FY99 and the Water Sector Project o f FYOl for
which a supplemental credit was approved in FY06, the Government began an ambitious
sector reform program. The program aims at ensuring management autonomy and a
53

rational sector organization; supporting improvements in commercial management/cost
effectiveness and establishing a new tariff policy to help reach financial equilibrium.
Under the program a state asset holding company, Socikte' de Patrimoine de Z'Eau du
Niger (SEEN), was created, and its operations contracted out in June 2001 to a private
operating company. Under a 10-year lease agreement, the private operator i s responsible
for managing sector assets, planning and financing investments and for economic and
quality o f service regulation. Significant progress has been made in improving the quality
o f service delivery, the efficiency o f operations and cost recovery. The volume o f
drinking water available for the population has increased as a result o f the reduction
unaccounted-for-water. I t i s expected that the volume o f available drinking water will
increase by more than 40 percent and the number o f private connections and public
standpipes will increase by 25 percent and 30 percent, respectively, by the end o f 2007.

42.
By securing the production capacity and main distribution networks, the
investment program will lay the ground for increased service coverage. The Government
has been implementing agreed (2000-06) water tariff and annual tariff increases to
achieve sector equilibrium. In the rural water sub-sector, a sustained investment effort
led to the construction o f safe water supply facilities (about 10,400 open wells, 6,300
boreholes and 250 small piped systems), which serve about 52 percent o f the rural
population. To improve performance the project i s supporting the Government's policy o f
promoting private operators' participation for small piped systems and other reforms to
help to restore sustainable services for 125,000 people in rural areas.
43.
Bank Program. The CAS anticipated three operations in the social sectors, one
each in health and education, and an HIV/AIDS prevention project for a total o f US$88
or about 38 percent o f programmed lending. The education and H I V / A I D S project were
approved for a total o f US$55 million or 25 percent o f total IDA financing during the
CAS period. The education project was advanced to FY03 from FY04. In addition to
expanding needed physical facilities, the education project has contributed to donor
coordination and has helped obtain budgetary allocations for the sector. The HIV/Aids
program, approved in April 2003, and part o f the region-wide AIDS program, was
designed to help put in place schemes that help control AIDS. The project had a slow
start, but it has been restructured and this i s expected to expedite implementation. The
health investment operation which closed during the CAS implementation period was
rated unsatisfactory in the achievement o f i t s development objectives. In addition to the
budget support operations which focused on social sectors, in FY06-07 two investment
operations were approved: an Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Program for
US$35 million (June 2006) and a US$lO.O million grant for Multi-Sector Demographic
Project (June 2007). In addition, a US$lO.O million Supplemental Grant for the Water
Sector Project was approved in FY07.
44.
The CAS programmed analytical work on poverty; gender issues; higher
education; a health strategy, population and urban transport. O f these, work was
completed on higher education, poverty, population and urban transport, all o f which
were discussed with Government. Background work on gender issues was undertaken
with financing from an IDF grant. The health sector strategy was postponed because
54

Bank funds were not allocated to this activity although informal work was carried out in
connection with the preparation o f the Health Sector Program approved in FY06.
45.
A major analytical study on population was presented and discussed with the
highest levels o f Government, and widely disseminated in the country. The study is
thought to have led to a breakthrough in the understanding o f the impact o f demography
o n the country's development prospects, and to political support. Policy and institutional
measures taken since 2004 are based on the recommendations o f the report.
PRSP Pillar 4: Improved Capacities

The CAS did not discuss a specific agenda for improving capacities, although
46.
benchmark indicators (not quantified) on procurement, preparation o f the MTEF and
decentralization were included, as were CAS objectives linked with the PRSP. Progress
was made on CAS monitoring benchmarks relating to procurement and public finance
(public finance activities are discussed under Pillar 1). With support from an IDF grant, a
program to strengthen public procurement was prepared. The program included
improving the legal and regulatory framework by modifying the procurement code;
issuing standard bidding documents and the delineation o f h c t i o n s for a procurement
supervisory body. There were difficulties with implementation o f the IDF grant, but
procurement legislation was revised and the Procurement Regulatory Authority
established. After approval, the legislation had to be adapted to that o f the West Africa
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) which issued regional directives at the end o f
2005. The revisions o f the legislation were completed in 2007.
3.

CAS Contribution to PRSP Goals and Monitoring

The majority o f the CAS planned outcomes and monitoring benchmarks were
47.
achieved, and there i s evidence that the Bank assistance program contributed to the PRSP
goals, particularly in the areas o f macroeconomic management, improved education
services, and population policy reform. However, as i s often the case, evaluating Bank
product contribution to specific country outcomes i s difficult.
48.
The CAS noted that monitoring was to take place at the project level where the
Bank would help strengthen project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks; and
at the level o f the overall assistance program. The CAS included a large number o f
indicators grouped as (a) CAS monitoring benchmarks and (b) indicators in a Country
Partnership Strategy Matrix derived from the PRSP indicators. Because o f the difficulties
with the indicators these do not appear to have been used to monitor progress under the
PRSP (PRSP progress reports do not refer back to them) or as a management tool during
CAS implementation. With respect to monitoring, the CAS noted that at the mid-point o f
the CAS period - in late FY04 - the Bank would review the indicators and targets to
assess progress in implementing the assistance program and adjust the Bank's strategy as
necessary. A draft CAS progress report was prepared and discussed at the Regional
level, but i t was determined that a f i l l CAS would be prepared instead. Problems with
the indicators included the following:
55

0

0
0

PRSP indicators in the Country Partnership Matrix could not be followed up because
there was insufficient data (e.g. social indicators); or the target was not included (e.g.
increased agro-pastoral production).
CAS benchmarks were not quantified (e.g. improved fiscal balance).
The precise links between long-term goals enunciated in the PRSP, the outcomes that
could be achieved during the CAS period, and the mechanisms by which IDA aimed
to help Niger meet those goals were not spelled out (e.g. preparation o f social and
agricultural plans; divestiture).

49.
The PRSP and CAS monitoring highlighted the need to improve the information
base in the country. A National Statistical Office has been established, and a household
survey has been carried out. In preparation for the second PRSP, the Government
selected key parameters to be monitored. The country team has focused on monitoring, as
discussed under Bank Performance below. In the CAS, the team intends to make
indicators and their baseline data clearly accepted by all involved, the l i n k s to the
interventions more explicit and to increasingly use the indicators as a management tool
throughout CAS implementation.
4.

Sustainability

50.
The process that guided the preparation and implementation o f the PRSP and the
release o f HIPC resources seems to have created a momentum for change that augurs
well for the sustainability o f ongoing reforms and which has led to the deepening and
extension o f the reform program. The December 2004, democratic elections consolidated
the power o f the President who was reelected, and i t can be considered a mandate to
pursue reforms, started in 2000. Because the reform program i s very broad,
understanding and appropriation o f the program at different levels o f government has
been difficult. As implementation o f the reform continues, key departments in the
Ministry o f Economy and Finance and in line ministries have begun to recognize the
potential benefits that could be derived from a more strategic approach to budget
planning and management, and from improved monitoring o f public expenditures and
overall public finance performance. Reforms in planning and budgeting processes at the
finance and sector ministry levels will not be easily reversed.

5 1.
In addition, the international community strongly supports the government's
economic and financial recovery program, i t s poverty reduction strategy and the budget
reform process. In this connection, support by all stakeholders to the conclusions and
recommendations o f the PEMFAR report has helped in the harmonization o f government
and donor objectives and program activities. This i s essential to improve coordination o f
donor interventions in budget management and poverty reduction.
52.
In spite o f the good prospects for sustainability, there are s t i l l significant risks
associated with the magnitude o f investments needed to impact positively on poverty
reduction. This is true both because o f the recent history o f Niger, and i t s limited
resources and because o f the relatively l o w level o f international support (including

56

IDA), given requirements. Also, the limited capacity will impair the speed o f reforms.
Lastly, despite the good performance made to date, the program ahead will require
considerable political courage o n the part o f the Government, and entrenched interests,
including those o f public enterprises, could derail some reforms.
5.

Institutional Impact

53.
The CAS agenda did not have a specific capacity building program, but the
operations put in place have included capacity building activities or components, and it i s
probable that change has been substantial both at the higher levels o f government and
also at the grass roots. Reforms in the health sector, a CAS priority, have been slower
than had been hoped for. Institutional change has also been modest in the electricity and
petroleum companies, which continue to have high operating costs and impact the
budget. The Bank has contributed to expanding public-private dialogue and begun the
discussion o f private-public partnerships, although Niger presents particular challenges in
attracting foreign investment and domestic invertors are few.
54.
Given the limited competencies in the country, there i s a need to develop a
program o f capacity building and to pursue aggressive change in institutions. This
approach i s in line with the recommendations o f the Operational Taskforce on Capacity
Development in Africa (report o f April, 2005). Capacity building and institutional
reform will likely require addressing issues associated with civil service reform.
6.

Exogenous Factors and Unintended Negative Impact

55.
The exogenous factors which affected CAS outcomes were those that slowed the
pace o f growth. The drought and locust infections affected agricultural output in 2004,
and the increased o i l prices adversely affected the balance o f payments. Because o f
Niger’s isolation, it appears that the political unrest in neighboring Nigeria and Ivory
Coast did not affect Niger.
56.
CAS implementation did not have any unintended negative impacts that the
country team is aware of. The budgetary limitations associated with the macroeconomic
program were foreseen and every effort was made to orient government expenditures to
priority activities. There was no unanticipated environmental damage from the irrigation
program.

D.

Bank Performance

57.
This section summarizes Bank performance which was satisfactory, particularly
in key areas such as the fiscal reform and education. Niger made progress towards the
planned CAS outcomes and IDA played a role in helping the country achieve results.

57

1.

Quality o f Products and Services

58.
The quality o f IDA’S products and services were generally satisfactory. The
economic work was well received and groundbreaking in the case o f public finance and
population. Outcomes in the area o f public finance and education and the population
analytical work, with which the Bank has been associated, have been impressive,
particularly given the country’s history and resources. Continuity o f staff and the depth o f
involvement contributed to the overall performance on the macroeconomic front.
Because the reform agenda i s broad, and the government competencies limited, it i s
important that the Bank provide consistent support to specific activities until the national
competencies have been built. Portfolio monitoring has been adequate. Internal reporting
notes that the portfolio faces problems (see below). ISRs show that the team has made
substantial progress in setting parameters to measure project outcomes, particularly in
FY06-07. This reflects better understanding o f measurement tools by the Bank and the
Government as well as the availability o f information gathered during the CAS period.
59.
The team prepared ICRs for six projects which closed during FY02-05, and the
development outcome o f all o f them was rated satisfactory in the ICRs. All ICRs were
reviewed by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED), which rated the development
outcome “unsatisfactory” for two o f these projects. The resulting “dis~onnect”’~figure
o f 33 percent i s about double that for Africa as a whole during the same period (about 17
percent). Both projects rated unsatisfactory by OED were investment operations,
reflecting the implementation problems o f the portfolio. One project, the Agro-Pastoral
Export Promotion project was subjected to a Quality o f Supervision Analysis by the
Bank’s Quality Assurance Group (QAG). The supervision effort was rated moderately
satisfactory, in part because the review team viewed the project ratings as unrealistic. A
Quality at Entry Review o f the Financial Sector Project rated it moderately satisfactory
(project complexity and regulatory issues associated with the with microfinance
component were highlighted as reasons).
60.
The team prepared ICRs for three operations that closed during FY06-07. The
I C R for the Second Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit rated the outcome o f the
operation as satisfactory with likely sustainability, reflecting the advances made in the
public finance agenda. The development outcome for the two investment operations
which focused on growth, the Privatization and Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance
Project and the Ago-Pastoral Export Promotion Project were rated marginally
unsatisfactory and unsatisfactory, respectively. The FY06-07 program drew lessons from
the experience with the two operations, which pointed to the need for more in depth
analytical work on the rural sector and the importance o f addressing divestiture issues in
the context o f a broader agenda. Work on the investment climate and rural sector carried
out in FY06-07 should inform Government policies and programs and the design o f Bank
interventions, and will be discussed in the new country strategy.

Portfolio Assessment

61.
The 2003 CAS described improvements in the projects under implementation in
the preceding CAS period. Data on portfolio performance in FY03-07 suggests that the
portfolio continued to have problems. As o f June 30, 2007, the portfolio included eight
operations,20 compared to nine operations at the end o f the CAS period in 2005. O f the
eight projects rated, three were rated satisfactory for the development objectives and one
was rated highly satisfactory. All but one o f the eight operations was rated moderately
satisfactory for implementation progress. O f the eight operations in the portfolio three
were rated problem projects (37 percent), which i s higher than the regional average o f 11
percent. At the end o f the CAS period in 2005, only one project was rated as a problem
project, but the increase in problem projects over the past two years may reflect more
realistic ratings rather than deterioration in the portfolio. The introduction o f new
classification criteria probably contributed to the downgrading o f some operations. One
project, irrigation, had been in problem status for one year. Reflecting the improved
assessment o f the portfolio, no projects were in potential problem status (100 percent
realism index over the Africa average o f 83 percent). This i s an improvement from the
end o f the CAS period, when three projects were potential problem projects. All projects
carry "risk" flags for country risk and country macroeconomic management.
62.
Implementation data during the CAS period and for FY06-07 shows that projects
that have supported private activities report least progress (Regulatory Reform, Irrigation
and Ago-Pastoral projects) reflecting the obstacles that Niger faces in increasing and
diversifying economic activity. Given the weight attributed to the expansion o f irrigated
lands in agriculture sector policy, the outcome o f the irrigation project, one o f the three
problem projects, is especially important. The dispersion o f Bank efforts in supporting
private activity and the absence o f analytical work to inform program design could also
have contributed to the slow progress in Bank programs in this area. The disbursement
ratio 21 averaged 24 percent during the CAS implementation period (FY03-05), which i s
about the same as that for Africa as a whole. The disbursement ratio during FY06-07
increased to 33 percent, higher than the Africa average o f 25 percent, reflecting the
weight o f the budget support operations in those years
63.
Portfolio problems were outlined in the draft Concept Note for the CAS Progress
Report prepared in February 2005. Responsibility for portfolio management was
assigned to the Country Manager in 2005, and the Country Office team worked with the
Government on portfolio issues; two CPPRs were conducted during the CAS
implementation period. The 2004 CPPR developed a three year action plan to address key
constraints identified -- project timing and design; weak project management; slow
decision-making o f the Government and the Bank; shortage o f counterpart funds; an
inadequate monitoring and evaluation. Task management has been transferred to the
country office for the HIV/AIDS, health and education projects. During CAS

implementation the two agricultural projects in the portfolio were also managed in the
country office. The QSA on the Agro-Pastoral Project (closed in October 2005) noted
that “...field-based supervision has enabled the team to be heavily engaged with the
Borrower, O n the other hand, i t wasn’t clear that some o f the local staff were fully
prepared to examine subprojects critically or to raise sensitive issues, until late in the
period under review.” The task manager for the water project i s assigned to the Senegal
Office, which should contribute to enhanced supervision. The Agro Pastoral Project, the
Private and Regulatory Reform and the HIV/Aids projects were rated “problem” projects
during the CAS implementation period; the three were on problem status for less than a
year, which partly reflected efforts by the Government and the Bank to resolve problems,
but also optimism on the part o f the Bank about progress, as suggested by the QSA for
the Ago-Pastoral project. Niger complied with the audit requirements o f all operations
in FY03 and FY04; one audit was late and one overdue in FY05 (out o f seven due), and
one audit was received late in FY06 (out o f seven due). A procurement audit was
conducted in 2005 on five projects. The audit showed a high percentage on noncompliant procedures in two o f the five projects reviewed. The November 2005 CPPR
focused on determining bottlenecks to project implementation and priority actions.
3.

Lending

64.
The 2003 CAS proposed a base case lending program o f US$238 million for eight
operations in FY03-FY05, including both program and investment lending. The high
case was only 9 percent higher than the base case, reflecting debt sustainability
considerations. In FY03-05, IDA provided financing o f US$219.4 million, o f which
US$84.38 million were in grants (Table 2). Program support was provided through two
operations for US$lOS, compared to the planned three operations for US$115 million.
The drop in the number o f operations resulted from delays in implementation o f the
reform program. All but the health investment operation were delivered either as planned
or in the case o f the Education Project, ahead o f schedule. The health project was
delivered in the first h a l f o f FY06. In addition, one investment operation, an emergency
credit to assist with the locust plague was approved in FY04 as was a Regional GEF
program for the Niger River Basin. In FY06-07, financial assistance to Niger totaled
US$l55 million o f which US$70.0 million or 45 percent were grants. In FY06-07, 65
percent o f the Bank financial support to Niger was in the form o f grants.
4.

Non-lending

65.
The CAS noted that past administrative budget constraints limited the Bank’s
non-lending services and the availability o f core economic work to inform the CAS. In
the two years that preceded the CAS, non-lending services were focused on supporting
the preparation o f the PRSP. The CAS included an ambitious program o f non-lending
activities, all but one o f which was carried out (Table 3). IDA made good use o f
analytical and advisory work during the CAS period. Analytical work was particularly
effective in the area o f public finance and population. The analytical work on public
finance was carried out jointly by the Government, the EC, and IDA, with the French aid
agency providing support. The report and associated action program is being used as a
60

common framework for public expenditure management reform by all partners. Work on
debt has underpinned Niger’s access to significant HIPC debt relief. On procurement,
IDA prepared a CPAR and some o f i t s recommendations are being implemented. IDA
has broken new ground in critical social issues. The population study illustrates the
implications o f continued rapid population growth on attaining the MDGs and helped
create a consensus o n the need for an integrated population policy addressing supply and
demand factors. The rural development sector work scheduled for FY03 and the Social
Protection Strategy Note scheduled for FY05 were postponed. Sector work on Rural
Development and a Rural Sector Public Expenditure Review were carried out in FY07.
A programmed Investment Climate Assessment was completed in FY06 rather than in
Y05. An Energy Assessment, also programmed for FY05 is expected to be started in
FY08. A Country Economic Memorandum, which was not programmed (Accelerating
Growth and Achieving the Millennium Development Goals: Diagnosis and Policy
Agenda) was started in FY06 and the draft report issued in September 2007.

5.

Country Dialogue and Donor Harmonization

66.
The CAS noted that coordination o f donor interventions had been weak, largely
because o f unstable conditions o f the 1990’s. With stability, there has been increased
donor coordination, and major partners participated actively in the elaboration o f the
sector analysis which set the foundation for the PRSP and the second PRSP. The PRSP
was the result o f an extensive consultative process which involved stakeholders and the
donor community.
67.
The CAS assumed that strong donor coordination would be required for the
proposed increase in programmatic lending. CAS implementation did lead to a
strengthening o f relationships among donors and stakeholders, and stakeholder
involvement was pivotal in advancing the discussions o n population policy. The
implementation o f the public finance and education programs and the design o f the health
program have also had considerable donor and stakeholder involvement. On the other
hand, i t is likely that the lack o f understanding and consensus on key issues stymied
reforms in the electricity and petroleum sectors. Donor consultation has improved during
the CAS period as follows:
0

0

K e y donors have supported the preparation o f sector strategies and investment
programs in education, health, and rural development and a sector strategy in
transport.
Donor programs are increasingly aligned with the PRSP, and the PRSP to the budget
cycle; IDA supported the PRSP Secretariat and UNDP in the alignment effort. IDA
collaborated with other donors to harmonize criteria for the release o f budget support.

IDA cooperation with the IMF has been very good. Fund conditionality blended well
with that o f IDA, and the IMF program was in line with the PRSP.

61

Leadership in multi-donor coalitions has been shared. IDA i s playing a lead role in
public finance and community development. Other donors have taken the lead in
education and rural development (France), health (Belgium), water (Switzerland),
food security (FAO), and H I V I A I D S (UNAIDS).
Funds from key donors have been pooled to fbnd the education sector investment
program.

The largest donors (IMF, the Bank the EU and France) meet regularly to coordinate
activities. Key sector work, such as the Public Expenditure Review was carried out
jointly with the EU, and was used by the IMF.
E.

Lessons for Subsequent CAS D e s i m

The best results were achieved when IDA was able to exploit synergies between
analytical work and adjustment lending. The chosen blend o f policy based lending
and investment lending worked well particularly in the area o f public finance. O n the
other hand, the PRSP focus o n rural development, which did not seem to have been
based on country-specific analytical work, yielded limited results. The Country Team
recognized the issue during CAS implementation and this led to the analytical work
on growth carried out starting in FY05 and the current focus on diversification.
In a country such as Niger where the Bank i s influential, there i s some merit to the
CAS having a broad agenda supporting the PRSP, although expectations should be
modest on what will be accomplished outside a core program. The CAS agenda was
very broad which probably helped keep donors and the Government focus on the
PRSP agenda, but the work program and the budgetary allocations were directed to
public finance and social sectors, where in fact, there were results. The Country
Team expects to narrow the focus o f the next CAS, which will concentrate on
accelerating economic growth and addressing demographic issues and selectivity will
guide IDA interventions in different sectors.

Assigning responsibility for portfolio management to the Country Manager in the
country office helped focus on portfolio problems. The Country Manager and the
country office staff are close to the projects and their counterparts. For that reason,
and because they work exclusively on Niger, they should be able to focus on the
portfolio, remove obstacles and anticipate problems. Local staff should interact with
international staff to ensure that international best practice i s brought to bear o n
portfolio problems, and that local staff receive adequate traininghupport on Bank
practices and procedures.

The root o f past problems with the rural portfolio will need to be addressed, given the
importance o f increasing production. To help accelerate growth and increase the
impact on poverty, the Bank will strengthen investments in infrastructure and the
productive sectors and help the Government r e i g n in population growth.
62

0

The CAS outcome indicators need to be linked clearly to IDA interventions and,
given the CAS timeframe, will be more modest and measurable. IDA will track
indicators that show linkage o f IDA interventions to higher level objectives.
Capacity issues continue to be a constraint to implementation o f development
programs in Niger. The Country Team will consider h o w to best to address the
problem, including the nature o f civil service reforms that can be advanced.

ANNEX4: JOINT FUND-BANK
DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

ANALYSIS

Niger remains at moderate risk of debt distress. Despite low debt ratios following debt relieJj
most recently in 2006 under the MDH, Niger has high externalJinancing needs and a
narrow export base. Although the public debt remains at acceptable levels under most stress
tests, external debt breaches one policy-dependent debt distress threshold under scenarios
incorporating export shocks, lower growth, and less generous Jinancing terms.

Background
1.
This joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis evaluates both the external
and the total public debt profile o f Niger based on end-2006 data, using the standard debt
dynamics templates for l o w income countries.22

2.
Niger’s debt ratios have been significantly reduced by debt relief, most recently
under the MDRI. Niger reached completion point o f the HIPC Initiative in April 2004 and
subsequently benefited from MDRI assistance from the IMF, IDA, and the African
Development Bank in 2006. Nominal external debt has thus fallen from over 90 percent o f
GDP at end-2000 to less than 15 percent o f GDP at end-2006. By end-2006, debt to AfDB,
IDA and the IMF accounted for 8,23 and 5 percent o f external debt, respectively, while the
remainder was constituted by borrowing from other multilateral lenders.
Underlying DSA Assumptions
The result o f the current exercise differs from the 2006 DSA mainly because of: (i)
3.
an
expected acceleration o f exports and GDP resulting from a substantial increase in uranium
a modestly lower
prices and the ongoing expansion o f uranium production capacity; and (ii)
grant element for concessional loans that reflects more accurately the terms for project
financing available to Niger from multilateral agencies.23B o x 1 describes the main
macroeconomic assumptions used for the baseline debt burden ratio calculations. The faster
exports growth projected (12 percent per year in 2007-16) represents a break from the past
(5.5 percent per year in 1997-2006) when mining exports were stagnant, reflecting l o w
uranium prices.24
External DSA
4.
Under the baseline scenario, all external debt ratios remain below their policydependent indicative thresholds throughout the projection period (2007-27) (Text
Table). The present value (NPV) o f debt-to-GDP ratio rises gradually and stabilizes below 25
percent by 2027, while the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio levels o f f at about 116 percent
(Table l b and Figure 1). The gradual rise in these indicators results from Niger’s high

The DSA was produced j o i n t l y by staff o f the IMF and the W o r l d Bank.
The analysis assumes an average grant element o f 46 percent in borrowing afler 2008, compared t o 50 percent
in the 2006 DSA.
24 The uranium price assumptions are conservative loolung forward as they are based o n only modest annual
increases f r o m the 2007 contract price, which i s still l o w in comparison to the international spot price.

2/ Simple Average

5.
Sensitivity tests show that Niger’s external debt burden could worsen
significantly in the event of plausible adverse macroeconomic shocks - particularly to
exports - or weaker economic performance, although ratios would remain below their
threshold levels under most o f these alternative scenarios. If key variables remain at the
historical average o f the previous ten years (scenario Al), the NPV o f debt-to-GDP and debtto-exports ratios would rise to 18 percent and 90 percent respectively by 2027, below the
baseline. This lower debt profile under the historical scenario reflects a lower level o f
borrowing and smaller current account deficits than are assumed going forward. In contrast,
two alternative scenarios - a temporary but strong reduction in export growth (scenario B2),
or a sizeable deterioration o f the terms for new borrowing (scenario A2)25- would result in a
more significant worsening of Niger’s debt profile, leading to breaches o f the debt-to-exports
threshold (but not o f any other threshold). Under the first of these tests, the export shock, the
NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio would peak in the medium term at 149 percent (just below i t s
150 percent threshold) but subsequently returns to a rising long-run trajectory, reaching
179 percent by 2027. Under the second o f these, assuming costlier financing terms, debt-toexports would rise more gradually, nonetheless reaching 180 percent by 2027. Similarly,
under a 35 percent grant element for new borrowing (scenario A4), the NPV o f debt-toexports ratio gradually rises to 164 percent by 2027.

25

Under scenario A2, interest costs are 2 percentage points above the baseline.

78

Niger’s external vulnerability i s underlined by a further country-specific
6.
scenario capturing poor investment outcomes, under which the high inflows and
investment under the baseline scenario do not lead to any growth dividend (scenario A3).
Real GDP growth was set to i t s historical (ten year) average (3.4 percent) while current
account deficits and borrowing patterns were left as in the baseline. This scenario can be
thought o f as roughly simulating poor performance in the public investment program in the
coming years, and also in the uranium sector. Under this scenario, the NPV o f debt-to-GDP
ratio gradually rises to 3 1 percent by the end o f the forecast period, thus respecting the
40 percent threshold.
Public DSA
Consideration o f total public debt, including domestic debt, does not
7.
significantly alter the assessment. Domestic debt stood at approximately 11 percent o f GDP
(45 percent o f total public debt) at end-2006 but i s projected to fall under the baseline
scenario, reaching about 5 percent by 2013 and continuing to decline thereafter (Table 2a).
This pattern is explained by relatively l o w primary fiscal deficits, averaging 2.5 percent o f
GDP for the first six years o f the projection period and less than 2 percent thereafter. The
average interest rate on domestic debt is very l o w (1.4 percent) as the bulk o f the debt i s
constituted by non-interest bearing arrears.

8.
A significant proportion of domestic debt as of end-2006 i s accounted for by
domestic arrears. The baseline analysis therefore also takes into account the ongoing
implementation o f a domestic arrears reduction plan, which reduces domestic debt to
10 percent o f total public debt by 2013, and nearly eliminate i t by 2017. Under these
assumptions, total public sector debt (NPV) would remain stable at around 20 percent o f
GDP up to 2017 and then gradually increase, but driven solely by new external debt. Two
sensitivity tests generate a significant rise o f public debt. The first o f these i s the standardized
stress test incorporating a two-year l o w growth shock. The second i s the country-specific
lower long-run growth scenario described above. In both cases, total public debt (NPV)
reaches about 40 percent o f GDP, and about 175 percent o f forecast revenue, by the end o f
the projection period (Figure 2).
Conclusion
9.
Staff assessment i s that despite low current levels of debt, Niger remains at
moderate risk of debt distress over the medium to long term. This risk assessment i s the
same as in the previous 2006 DSA. Debt and debt service ratios remain at comfortable levels
under the baseline assumptions and stress tests reveal breaches o f the policy-dependent
external debt-to-exports threshold only under three o f the eight standardized stress tests.
Niger i s financing significant current-account deficits and the baseline used for this D S A
incorporates GDP growth rates that are based on the assumed impact o f a large program o f
public investment and rapid expansion in mining. The standardized tests o f export shocks or
costlier financing terms underline the moderate risk assessment.

79

The results of the DSA underscore the need for the authorities to pursue prudent
10.
debt policies, seeking maximum concessionality, combined with sound macroeconomic
management and export diversification.W h i l e the debt profile has improved with the
granting o f HIPC and MDRI assistance and better prospects for sustained growth, the country
remains vulnerable to external shocks. Policies should therefore aim to boost growth and
diversify the productive base, particularly exports, while continuing to privilege grants and
highly concessional loans.

80

Box 1. Baseline scenario assumptions

The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2007-27 hinges o n the following assumptions:
Real GDP growth i s expected to rise from i t s historical average (1997-2006) o f 3.4 percent to an
average o f 5.5 percent in 2007-16, fostered mainly by increased investment and production o f
uranium. In 2017-27, after a moderation o f the uranium boom, annual GDP growth i s expected to
settle at about 5 percent. This level i s s t i l l above the historical average, and results from planned
investments in irrigation and infrastructure, as well as o f ongoing reforms to improve the investment
climate.
The investment rate i s projected to be high in 2007-12, between 25 and 28 percent o f GDP, partly
as a result o f planned uranium-related investments. Investment would remain at around 20 percent o f
GDP in 20 14-27, as mining-related investment decline.
The assumed GDP deflator would be below 2.5 percent throughout the period.
The revenue-to-GDP ratio i s projected to rise gradually from 12.9 percent in 2006 to about
17 percent by 2025, reflecting the gradual convergence o f the tax revenue ratio to the WAEMU norm
(17 percent). Public expenditures would rise sharply from 18.6 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 23 percent
by 2008, and should remain between 23 and 24 percent o f GDP during the rest o f the projection
period, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to promote growth and increase social spending.
The evolution o f total exports in the medium term will be largely determined by developments in
uranium exports, resulting from investments to expand production and f r o m higher prices.
Investments related to uranium in 2008-2012 are projected at around 30 percent o f GDP, leading to a
tripling o f current production by 20 14 mainly because o f the new Imourarem project. Uranium prices
have increased by 60 percent from 2006 to 2007, and are conservatively projected to increase by
2 percent per year in the future. With the sharp increase in uranium exports, overall exports growth in
current price, i s projected at about 12 percent per year in 2007-16, which compares to 5.5 percent in
the last ten years when mining exports were stationary.
With a moderation in the growth o f uranium exports and drop in gold production (expected to
peak in 20 lo), growth in exports after 20 16 i s largely dependent on expected acceleration in other
sectors. Nominal exports are projected to grow during 2017-2027 at about 7 percent per year.
Uranium-related activity will also boost other items o f the current account through increased
imports o f equipment and capital goods, higher repatriation o f profits, and larger compensation to
foreign employees. Hence, total imports in nominal terms would grow around 9 percent on average
during 2007-16, with the current account deficit-to-GDP ratio reaching a peak in 2012. Afterwards,
imports are projected t o grow broadly in line with nominal GDP growth, with the current account
deficit as a share to GDP declining gradually.
The average interest rate o n new external borrowing i s projected at 1.2 percent, assuming h a l f o f
new external debt i s contracted on IDA terms and h a l f at an interest rate o f about 2 percent. Project
financing in the form o f external grants and loans i s projected to rise in line with nominal GDP, with
grants being two thirds o f the total. External budgetary financing will remain stable in current terms
after reaching a peak in 2007-08, with grants also about two thirds o f the total.
The domestic debt profile assumes a reduction o f domestic arrears in 2007-13 and n o domestic
financing o f the deficit after 20 17. The average interest rate on the stock o f debt i s very l o w
(1.4 percent) because arrears do not pay interest. The interest rate o f new domestic financing up to
2017 i s assumed at 4 percent.
These assumptions lead t o an improvement in the non-interest current account deficit from an

ANNEX12: CAS CONSULTATIONS
In March and April 2008, the Niger Country office conducted extensive consultations
with key constituencies and opinion-makers in Niger including governments, parliamentarians,
the media, youth, academics, the private sector, CSOs and other community groups. The
discussions took place in the capital Niamey as well as in the regions o f Zinder, Maradi,
Tillabery and Dosso These consultations build on, and follow the client survey o f June 2007.
Although different groups brought diverse perspectives, there were significant areas o f
agreement:

- Human capital development: Participants noted that recent policies and programs implemented
by the Government with the support o f Donors partners have contributed to boost access to
education and health services. However, improvements in the quality o f services have not been
easy to come by. While the challenge for universal access to basic services especially in
education remains, many participants have indicated the need to begin shifting attention from
access to improving quality.

-

Rural development: Many stakeholders indicated that rural development will remain an
important engine for growth in Niger. Therefore, they have called for significant involvement o f
the Bank in agriculture sector to allow further expansion o f cultivated areas and raising the
productivity gains through (i)more physical investments (irrigation, access to water and
electricity); (ii)land management, (iii)better rural-urban-regional economics linkages and
(iv)accessibility to an efficient agriculture inputs market.

- Sustainable growth andpoverty. Many participants pointed out that despite the fact Niger has a
good track record o f macroeconomic management, poverty remains high and living conditions in
general did not improve. They would l i k e to see a growth that has positive impact on population
income levels, infrastructures and quality o f service.
-

Governance. There i s concern about governance and efficient use o f public hnd. While
recognizing the commitment o f the current government to fight corruption, many felt such
commitment should be constantly followed by more robust and decisive actions.

- Population challenges. The majority o f stakeholders considered that rapid population growth is
the most critical development challenges Niger faces. Some o f the participants are already very
active in education and communication activities around the topic and were eager for more
involvement. They said that girls’ access to education and empowerment o f women would be
critical in addressing population growth. The openness and the seriousness that have
characterized the discussions on population dynamics indicate that the subject i s no longer taboo
in Niger.
- Vulnerability. Niger geographical position and vulnerability to adverse climate conditions have
been prominent in the debate. Participants insisted on the necessity for the country to define a
coherent national strategy to be supported by donors in order to overcome, in a sustainable
manner, the recurrent food insecurity issues. M a n y considered this as urgent task given the food
price inflation context.
