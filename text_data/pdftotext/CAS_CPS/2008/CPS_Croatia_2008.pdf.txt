COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR FY09-FY12
THE REPUBLIC O F CROATIA
Executive Summary

1.
Croatia’s overarching priority i s to enter the EU with a competitive and growing economy
and the institutional capacity to meet the demands of membership. This entails reducing Croatia’s
external vulnerability, completing its transition to a market economy, fostering greater competitiveness,
and achieving convergence with EU income levels. These priorities are shared across the political
spectrum and society, albeit with varying degrees o f emphasis, and form the basis o f the Bank’s
assistance to Croatia.
2.
Croatia showed strong economic performance during the past few years. In 2004-07,
economic growth was close to 5 percent and inflation remained low, at around 3 percent. This year will
likely see a somewhat lower growth rate and higher inflation largely due to the soaring global food and oil
prices. While sound macroeconomic management has been a main contributor to the success o f the past
years, implementationof structural reforms has been uneven.

3.
The government, led by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader’s Croatian Democratic Union Party
(HDZ), received a second mandate at the end of last year. This provides an opportunity to consolidate
and accelerate economic reforms, and to complete the wide-ranging legal and institutional changes
required by the country’s EU accession.
4.
The goal of this Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which spans FY09-FY12, i s to support
the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process, the rapid convergence of its income level with
that o f current EU member states in a fiscally, socially and environmentally sustainable fashion,
and a decent quality o f life for Croatia’s citizens. This overarching goal i s fully in line with the
government’s priorities expressed in various government programs. In order to support the achievement
of this goal, the Bank Group program will aim at contributing in four areas:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

sustaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;
improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and
increasing the sustainability o f long-term development.

5.
The EU accession agenda will remain a cross-cutting theme in the design and
implementation of the Bank Group’s program. In the selection and design o f operations, primary
consideration will be given to how the proposed project supports Croatia’s EU accession agenda. In the
case o f social sectors where there i s no EU ucquis, consideration will also be given to how projects
complement the EU accession efforts. This assessment will be made together with the authorities and in
close collaboration with the EC. Project components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds,
especially following accession, will have high priority.
6.
The CPS envisages an indicative base case lending envelope o f about USN.0-1.4 billion over
the four year period. The base case lending program would only include non-policy based operations.
This program could be complemented with a series o f one-tranche DPLs, especially in support o f reforms
in the public sector and to improve Croatia’s competitiveness, as opportunities arise and government
commitment i s ensured. With DPLs, under an upside scenario, lending could reach US$1.4-1.8 billion
during the CPS period.
Traditional IBRD loans are likely to be supplemented by other IBRD
instruments, such as disaster and catastrophe risk insurance, catastrophe risk deferred drawdown option,
sub-national lending and debt management products. The lending program will be based on and

1

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas of public expenditure reform, governance,
investment climate and climate change. Over time, the Bank will also explore possible fee-for-service
arrangements to support a broader agenda o f economic work.

7.
The design and implementation of the program will be demand-driven and flexible. As
envisaged under the Bank Group’s Middle-Income Countries agenda, the CPS represents a broad
framework in which the Bank Group can flexibly respond to emerging priorities in a timely fashion. The
program i s defined for the first two years o f the CPS period, and will be adjusted to respond to Croatia’s
emerging needs at the time of the CPS Progress Report.
8.
Close collaboration with I F C i s envisaged. The Bank and IFC will work together to support
private sector investments and PPP solutions in infrastructure in particular. IFC’s focus on postprivatization restructuring in priority sectors such as information and communication technology,
construction materials and agribusiness will complement the Bank’s efforts to support enterprise
privatization under the PAL program. IFC’s investments helping domestic companies to increase their
competitiveness and efficiency as well supporting strong and growing local companies to expand into
higher-value-added products and/or to invest in neighboring countries, will contribute to the
competitiveness agenda supported by both the Bank and IFC. Finally, IFC’s support for local companies
to improve their corporate governance, environmental standards and social standards will contribute to the
broader Bank and IFC agenda to support Croatia’s preparation for EU accession.

9.
There are three main sources of risks to the success of the planned program: Croatia’s
external vulnerability, continued uneven reform performance, and implementation capacity
weaknesses. With an external debt-to-GDP ratio o f 95.7 percent in USD terms (or 89.1 percent of GDP
in EUR terms’) and a current account deficit o f 8.6 percent at end-2007, Croatia remains exposed to
unfavorable external developments. Notwithstanding the above, the country has weathered the financial
turbulence that followed the collapse o f the sub-prime market in the US. This shows that Croatia’s
economic fundamentals have improved over time, i t s EU accession process i s seen as a solid anchor by
external financiers and that macroeconomic policies have remained largely on track. Nonetheless, it i s
likely that reform performance will remain uneven. This i s in part because some of the reforms, like the
restructuring of railways and shipyards, are politically difficult to implement, and in part because some of
the other reforms, such as the reform of the judiciary and public administration, are complex and take
time. Finally, there i s also uneven capacity in the administration to design and implement policies and
projects.

10.
I n the forthcoming period, Croatia expects to complete its EU accession negotiations and
get ready for full membership. The Bank has gained a wealth of experience in supporting candidate
countries in their last phase of preparation for EU membership, and this experience i s widely appreciated
in Croatia. The Bank i s ready to accompany Croatia on its journey to a socially and environmentally
sustainable, more competitive economy fully integrated into the EU.
1 1.

Guidance i s sought from the Executive Directors on the following issues in particular:

(i) Are Croatia’s development challenges adequately reflected in the CPS, taking into account
the country’s EU accession process?
(ii) Are the priorities of engagement, planned instruments, and flexibility o f CPS design
appropriate for the challenges described?
(iii) Are risks to the success o f the program properly identified?

’

The two ratios differ due to the end-of-period exchange rate used for debt conversion and the period-average rate used for GDP conversion
as per the convention followed by the Croatian authorities.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

I. Country Context
A. Political and Social Context

1.
A new coalition government led by the Croatian Democratic Union Party (HDZ) was
endorsed by the Croatian Parliament in January 2008. The coalition i s based on an alliance forged
with the Peasants’ Party (HSS) and the Social Liberal Party (HSLS). The new government’s strategy, as
described in the Program of the Government o f the Republic of Croatia for the 2008-2011 Mandate,
emphasizes undertaking structural reforms that would lead to sustained and regionally balanced growth.
The Program’s goals are to achieve and sustain macroeconomic stability with real growth at 7 percent,
reduce unemployment to 7 percent and balance the central budget by 2010. To achieve these goals, the
government plans to: (i) complete judicial and public administration reforms, (ii) complete the
privatization process and seriously tackle corruption, (iii) intensify development o f SMEs and increase
agricultural competitiveness while pursuing a balanced development o f all regions, (iv) foster the tourism
sector with further development o f infrastructure, and (v) promote a knowledge-based society.
2.
After Croatia was granted candidate status in June 2004, formal EU accession negotiations
were launched in October 2005. To date, Croatia has opened 20 out o f 33 negotiations chapters of the
acquis communautaire with the European Commission, and provisionally closed two-Education and
Culture, and Science and Research. In its 2007 Progress Report, the EU has indicated that the
government will need to invest considerable efforts towards judicial and public administration reforms,
competition and anti-corruption policies as well as environment and agriculture. The EC announced
earlier this year that Croatia i s well placed to conclude i t s accession negotiations by November 2009.
Preparations for NATO membership are also on track; Croatia received an invitation to join NATO at the
April 2008 summit in Bucharest.’

3.

The 2006 poverty analysis3 reveals that poverty in Croatia i s relatively low and shallow, but
persistent since the late 1990s. Four percent o f the population lives on less than US$4.30 a day4,and 1 1
percent lives on or less than US$10 a day’ which represents Croatia’s absolute poverty line. About one
percent o f the population faces severe deprivation.6 Given the relatively low levels o f poverty, a targeted
transfer o f about 0.7 percent o f GDP would have lifted Croatia’s poor out o f absolute poverty. Income
inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, was 0.25 in 2004, which i s on par with the average o f
advanced transition countries.

4.
Unemployment rates dropped to historically low levels and employment increased to 57
percent’ in 2007. Nevertheless, Croatia’s employment rate remains lower than that of European
economies and well below the Lisbon target o f 70 percent. The employment figures reflect a relatively
low labor force participation rate among the working age population (63.1 percent) and a relatively high
unemployment rate (9.6 percent). Furthermore, there i s a high incidence o f long-term unemployment.
About 60 percent of Croatia’s unemployed remain without a job for more than a year, with weakening
prospects for re-enteringthe labor market and leading to social exclusion.

’

On July 9, 2008, Croatia signed the Accession Protocol for joining NATO.
The analysis was carried out under the Croatia Living Standard and Regional Development Study (LSA) World Bank Report No. 37992-HR
(February 7,2007) and based on the 2002-2004 household budget surveys.

B. Recent Economic Developments
Croatia has enjoyed robust growth (of close to 5 percent) with low inflation (on average
below 3 percent) in the past few years, largely due to successful economic transformation and the
start of EU accession negotiations. Real GDP growth amounted to an average of 4.5 percent in 2004-06
and accelerated to 5.6 percent in 2007. Growth has been underpinned primarily by an increase in gross
fixed investment and personal consumption. Personal consumption was fuelled by expansion of
government transfers to households and pensioners’ debt repayment, as well as higher employment and
robust credit growth. Industry, retail trade and financial intermediation have been key contributors to
GDP growth. Growth diagnostics for the 2002-2006 period confirmed that major contribution to growth
(50 percent) came from capital accumulation, with limited contribution from TFP growth in recent years
(30 percent) and even less from labor (as high unemployment rates and relatively low labor participation
rates have led to low employment rates). Production function-based estimates suggest that Croatia’s
potential growth i s close to 5 percent. Inflation remained modest, helped by central bank efforts to
maintain exchange rate stability and government fiscal consolidation efforts. However, inflationary
trends are reasserting themselves as a result of soaring global food and oil prices, despite somewhat
weaker pressure on the demand side.

6.

7.
Fiscal consolidation has taken place in the past few years to arrest rapid growth in public
debt and create room for increased competitiveness through potential reduction of the high tax burden.*
The fiscal deficit declined from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2007. The 2008 budget
enacted in March 2008 showed the deficit at around the same level as in 2007. The general government
debt-to-GDP ratio rose slightly from 43.2 percent in 2004 to 43.8 percent in 2005, and then declined to 38
percent by 2007.’ Further fiscal consolidation i s needed, given that public expenditures are high by
international standards” - at 48.9 percent of GDP in 2007. The economy’s high degree of euroization
poses a risk to macroeconomic stability and leaves the government with little room to maneuver in the
event of shocks. Hence, sound fiscal policy will be crucial to arresting external vulnerabilities and
maintaining Croatia’s macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Furthermore, reaching a balanced

10

The average tax burden for the new E U member states (EUIO) was around 34 percent o f GDP in 2006 as opposed to 40
percent o f GDP in Croatia, which was on par with the EU27.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio, which includes all guarantees and HBOR debt, rose slightly from 5 1.7 percent in 2004 to 52.3
percent in 2005, and then declined to 47.8 percent by 2007.
The average general government spending for EU new member states (EU10) was about 39.8 percent of GDP in 2006.
However, when making a comparison with the EU countries, i t should be noted that the Croatian GDP has not yet been fully
corrected for the informal economy.

2

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
budget by 2010 - an important government goal - would require robust frontloaded expenditurereducing measures.

8.
A tightened monetary policy has helped stabilize domestic credit expansion, driven by rising
corporate sector activity and shift in government borrowing towards the domestic market. In
addition to maintaining price stability and stabilizing the exchange rate, in 2007, the Croatian National
Bank (CNB) remained focused on measures to curb external debt growth and banks’ credit growth, to
reduce external vulnerability. During 2007, the CNB continued to apply instruments of marginal and
special obligatory reserves. It also introduced additional administrative and prudential measures to
control the growth and quality of domestic bank placements, respectively, with a credit ceiling introduced
in early 2007 (which stipulated compulsory purchase of CNB bills on credit growth in excess of 12
percent per annum). This ceiling was further tightened to 3 percent during the second half of 2007 given
that credits had already expanded by 9 percent in the first half of 2007. The CNB’s restrictive monetary
policy has continued in 2008 and will most likely continue in 2009.
Monetary developments have been in line with the CNB’s goal of limiting credit expansion
9.
and the accompanying rise in debt. Despite commercial banks’ strong credit activities, bank placement
to the non-banking sector slowed down from 22.9 percent in 2006 to 15.0 percent in 2007. Household
loans increased by 18 percent, while signs are emerging of a squeeze-out of corporate sector loans, in
particular SMEs, as large enterprises diverted to direct borrowing from abroad. The euroization of the
economy i s limiting options for interest rate policy and placing high expectations on a stable exchange
rate. Deposits denominated in foreign currency account for two-thirds of total deposits, almost equal to
the ratio of foreign currency and foreign currency denominated loans to overall loans, and about
90 percent o f the banking system’s foreign assets. The large but declining share of foreign exchangelinked loans to unhedged borrowers (from 77 percent of total loans in 2004 to about 61 percent in 2007)
exposes banks to indirect foreign exchange risk.
However, accounting and prudential standards
combined with sound risk management and banking supervision have assured confidence in the banking
system and appear to have prevented immediate vulnerability threats or sudden reversals in capital flows.

10.
The current account deficit continued to widen, mostly due to rising oil and commodity
prices as well as goods imports stimulated by credit growth. Although public sector savings
improved, private external liabilities have been growing fast. After reaching 8.6 percent in 2007, the
CAD to GDP ratio i s expected to reach 8.8 percent in 2008, and subsequently narrow due to slower
domestic demand and a policy mix aimed at avoiding excessive overheating and disorderly adjustments in
external balances. On the financing side, the share of non-debt creating inflows” increased from 5
percent of GDP in 2006 to 5.3 percent in 2007, reflecting a rise in equity capital. With monetary policy
mainly focused on financial and price stability, efforts to address external risks will depend largely on
fiscal policy.

11.
Although Croatia has so far felt limited effects from the global financial turbulence,” the
comparably large stock of external debt remains a source of potential vulnerability, increasing the
speed and magnitude with which adverse external financial shocks may be transmitted. External
debt in US$ terms increased from 89.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 95.7 percent by the end of 2007, more
than doubling since 2001. External debt in EUR terms increased from 85.5 percent of GDP in 2006 to
89.1 percent in 2007, due to the depreciation of the US d01lar.l~ Government external debt amounted to

FDI minus intercompany lending plus portfolio investments.
Spreads on sovereign debt rose by 150 basis points and stock prices slumped by around 30 percent in Q1 2008.
There was an upward adjustment o f the external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 by 1.4 percentage points (or 1.3 p.p. in EUR
terms), due to a change in the external debt reporting system in line with EU requirements.

19.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2007, while domestic banks and other sectors (private and public
corporate sector, non-bank financial institutions, and households) owed foreign creditors the equivalent of
25.5 and 51.0 percent of GDP, respectively. Among other sectors, the largest share was due to the
borrowing by private sector companies (60 percent) and non-bank financial institutions (around 20
percent)14. Government debt declined as a result of fiscal consolidation efforts and a shift to domestic
financing, which continued in 2008. Short-term external debt remains low at 13.2 percent of total
external debt and accounts for approximately 50 percent of foreign exchange reserves. Croatia’s reserves
position i s comfortable (close to six months of imports) mostly as a result of strong FDI inflows over the
last two years (above 8 percent of GDP p.a.) which more than financed the current account deficit.
12.
Positive developments in the real sector will likely continue during the CPS period with
economic growth expected to average around five percent in the medium term The 2008-2012
growth projections, as described in section III G, are underpinned by (i)the assumption of Croatia’s EU
accession by 20 11; (ii)improved macroeconomic stability, which would stimulate private investment,
particularly greenfield investments; (iii)stronger export performance; and (iv) narrowing public sector
size which will create new opportunities for private sector growth in line with the Program of the
Government of the Republic of Croatia for the 2008-2011 Mandate.
11. Croatia’s Key Development Challenges

A. Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability
Croatia’s large public sector poses one of the main challenges to sustained growth. Public
13.
expenditure accounts for nearly half of the GDP, some nine percentage points above the average for
EU10, reducing the fiscal space to finance EU accession requirement^.'^ Rationalization of the public
sector wage bill and employment, subsidies
Figure 2: Cross-Country Macro Comparison, 2006
(especially railways and shipyards), social
benefits, and health spending would help ease
the fiscal pressure, albeit presenting potential
political challenges for the government.
Further fiscal consolidation i s required due to
Croatia’s relatively high tax burden: taxes-toGDP ratio i s above 40 percent, which puts it on
par with the EU15, but approximately 8
percentage points above the EU10. Given that
the

has become even more important.
Prudent fiscal policies can help ease Croatia’s large current account deficit and external debt.
14.
The government has already taken steps to address risks by reducing deficits. In the long term, however,
fiscal reforms aimed at reducing public expenditures will be critical to containing Croatia’s vulnerability.
Enhancing the efficiency of public expenditure management, in particular moving from input budgeting
towards performance-basedbudgeting, could help the fiscal consolidation process.

15

The gross external debt o f the broadly defined public sector, which includes the general government, public enterprises and
mixed-ownership enterprises stood at around 27 % o f GDP at the end o f 2007, according to the Croatian National Bank.
Croatia did not correct its official GDP figures fully for non-observed economy, as opposed to all EU member states. By
assuming an increase in GDP numbers by around 15 percent, the level o f general government spending will still remain
above the EUlO level by 3 percentage points o f GDP, but below the EU15 level.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

15.
Rationalization o f public expenditure will require serious efforts to reform Croatia’s health
sector, social systems and state aid policies. Croatia’s health outcomes are better than in many countries
at similar income levels, but these results were achieved at a high cost. Today, continued deficits affect
the sustainability o f the system. The stock of hospital and the national health insurance fund (HZZO)
arrears have been increasing since 2004, exceeding 1 percent of GDP by the end o f 2006. The large
benefits and widespread exemptions introduced during the early growth years have been politically
difficult to roll back. The main challenge in the medium term will be to maintain and improve health
outcomes while achieving a steady level o f public spending under a sound fiscal policy framework.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
Similar issues face Croatia’s social benefits system, which offers more than one hundred programs and i s
hindered by weak targeting efficiency, a complicated and costly administration, and disincentives for
labor market participation - all of which have contributed to poverty and inequality in the country. An
aging population and limited financial resources have made social system reform unavoidable. Railway
and shipyards restructuring efforts would also need to be tackled with due diligence, not only to promote
fiscal stability, but to adhere to state aid rules and avoid sudden adjustment shocks in the future.
16.
Given the Croatian economy’s high degree of euroization, its financial sector remains
vulnerable to interest and exchange rate risks. Exposure to interest or exchange rate fluctuations
could raise the cost of domestic lending, and in turn, constrain private debtors’ ability to service their
loans. With loans to firms and households denominated in or indexed to foreign currency and largely
unhedged, credit risk stemming from foreign currency exposes Croatia’s banking system to external
financial shocks. The Croatian National Bank has taken several measures to control risks by discouraging
foreign borrowing by banks, monitoring foreign exchange exposures o f bank clients, and strengthening
supervision o f banks. Further efforts in strengthening supervision o f the whole financial sector and
addressing home-host relations are needed. Structural reforms supported by the PAL program can further
mitigate these vulnerabilities by facilitating deeper fiscal consolidation to (i)reduce the public and
external debt burdens, and (ii)shrink the public sector to allow for private sector activity and attract more
investments that are less dependent on debt-creating inflows.

17.
While macroeconomic sustainability i s needed for growth, faster growth leading to higher
future fiscal revenues i s in turn needed for macroeconomic sustainability. Hence, strengthening the
microeconomic foundations of growth i s o f critical importance. There are “sources” o f additional
growth that Croatia could tap into, through undertaking measures to: (i)increase labor participation by
addressing the disincentives for workers’ participation in the labor market while reducing restrictions to
facilitate the adjustment of the labor force to the business cycle; contain the cost o f labor and address
skills mismatches through vocational education and training, and life-long learning; (ii) enhance total
factor productivity by continuing enterprise restructuring, further reforming product market regulation,
improving the corporate governance regime, streamlining bankruptcy conditions, and reducing the
administrative obstacles to business; (iii)deepen trade integration by promoting export-oriented FDI and
developing the supply o f exportable goods with expansion of trade related services (standards and quality,
knowledge o f foreign markets) and the reduction o f logistics costs; and (iv) foster technological progress
by expanding private R&D, improving conditions for the collaboration between universities and industry,
and enabling the start up o f science-based companies, as further described in the next section.
B. Strengthening Private Sector-Led Growth and Accelerating Convergence with EU
18.
Croatia’s private sector share of GDP has increased from 60 to 70 percent during the 20032007 period, though it remains much lower than that of the EU10. Weakness in the functioning o f
the judiciary, bureaucratic red tape, unfinished privatization and soft budget constraints have limited
enterprise restructuring and new business creation, and constrained growth. To accelerate growth and
achieve faster convergence with EU27 per capita income levels, a key priority will be to improve the
investment climate and promote private sector-led growth.
According to the 2008 Doing Business Report, Croatia i s among the top ten reformers for
19.
the second year in a row, with marked improvements in starting and closing a business, registering
property and facilitating access to credit. Croatia ranked 97 out o f 178 countries on the overall ease o f
doing business, significantly up from 124 the previous year. However, it ranks far behind EU countries
with similar income levels (Slovakia 32, Poland 74). High taxation levels, inflexible labor market
regulations and a cumbersome licensing system continue to pose obstacles to operating in the formal

The World Economic Forum's Competitiveness Reports 2005-2007 ranked inefficient public

administration at the top of the list o f barriers for doing business in Croatia.I6 The proliferation of
agencies and subordinate entities with operational autonomy and revenue-raising capabilities i s placing a
huge burden on coordination and management, compromising value-for-money and quality of service
delivery. Adequate public administration capacities constitutes one of the key requirements for EU
membership and the experience of EU8I7 suggests that public administration reforms will require a long
haul effort supported by soundly performing systems across government combined with professional,
merit-based, and independent civil service. In 2005, Croatia adopted a new civil service law aimed at
introducing merit-based recruitment, the professionalization and depoliticization of civil service and
greater transparency and accountability in the public sector.
The justice system was also

Access to skilled labor was considered a "major" o r "very severe" obstacle for growth by
almost 10 percent of the entrepreneurs in 2005. Croatia has one of the lowest employment rates
among European co~ntries.'~
This situation stems partly from social welfare and pension programs that
discourage individuals to participate in the labor markets. Also, demographic projections indicate that the
size of the economically active age group will start to decline by 2010. Taken together, these trends
imply that demand for labor may soon outpace supply, exerting an upward pressure on local wages. In
addition, a growing skills gap in educational attainments and labor training suggests that the private sector
may face a shortage of skilled labor, challenging the notion that Croatia enjoys a relatively elastic supply
of skilled labor.20

I Box 1: Governance Update: Croatia Takes Steps to Combat Corruption
Corruption remains a concern for entrepreneurs, and Croatia has taken concrete steps towards
confronting the problem. Corruption has declined since 2002, according to the results o f the EBRD-World
Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS). The Parliament approved the AntiCorruption Program 2006-2008, devoting special attention to the judiciary, health services, local government,
and public administration, where corruption i s considered to be most prevalent. An ambitious action plan
covering all the ministries was subsequently prepared. The capacity of the Office for the Prevention of
Corruption and Organized Crime has been strengthened. A series of reforms were launched including the
adoption o f ethics codes, codes of conduct in the public sector, conflict o f interest legislation, and public
procurement and state aid legislation. The public finance management system was strengthened. Steps were
also taken to depoliticize public administration, reform political party financing, and introduce direct elections
o f city mayors and county prefects. As Croatia proceeds with reform implementation, political commitment to
combat malfeasance will need to continue.

Croatia has started to modernize its logistics infrastructure, regaining relevance as a costand carbon footprint-effective route in the region. Croatia’s location and the three pawEuropean
Transport Corridors that cross the country offer a cost-efficient and environment-friendly access to
Central European markets for cargoes originating from the East and Far East compared with Northern
European Corridors. As a result, Croatia managed to develop sizeable activity in transit services to
neighboring countries, with transit representing between 70 and 85 percent o f traffic in its two main
international ports and about 65 percent o f rail freight cargo revenues. In infrastructure, Croatia
developed a vast network o f motonvay over a short period o f time (the present phase costs on average 4.0
percent o f GDP annually) and now enjoys a large road network comparable to EU15 standards. In future
investment programs, strengthened emphasis on maintenance o f roads versus new construction i s
warranted. Croatia also launched a number o f projects in the port sector (Rijeka, Ploce, and Zadar) to

terms) remains low.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
upgrade port capacity and endorsed a new HRK 18 billion National Railway Infrastructure Program for
the next four years to upgrade i t s network.

25.

While Croatia’s overall trade logistics performance has improved in recent years, it still
remains behind EUlO countries. In 2007, Croatia ranked 63 out of 150 countries in the Logistics
Performance Index.22 While Croatia i s competitive on domestic logistics costs, it s t i l l faces capacity
constraints along major international corridors that on-going projects will only partly alleviate, given the
strong traffic growth experienced over the past five years. Total container traffic in the two international
sea ports increased from 21,000 containers (TEU) in 2002 to 175,000 TEU in 2007, drawing on all
available capacity. On the service side, Croatia i s only starting to offer value-added services through
regional logistics centers, compared to other EU new member states. With the anticipated EU accession,
Croatia has the potential to offer an attractive location for such services, in line with its role as a leader in
Southeast Europe for sustainable economic development and regional cooperation.
Upgrading trade logistics performance requires an integrated public-private approach to
26.
improve the quality and range o f services offered and to support the development of logistics
infrastructure, particularly in ports. Investments and know-how needs in both infrastructure and
services remain substantial considering that, in a base case scenario, demand for containerized cargo
through Croatian ports i s forecast to double by 2015.23 This requires an integrated development of ports,
rail and road hinterland connections to European corridors, and related distribution centers as well as
public-private partnerships in financing and bringing in global logistics expertise.

27.
The Croatian Railway Company (HZ) i s undergoing a major restructuring process which
could benefit from greater momentum to increase revenues and reduce operating costs, especially
through further retrenchments. The current level of subsidies in the railways sector i s unsustainable at
0.7 percent of GDP which i s high compared to the EU and neighboring countries. As in other countries
of the region, the sector i s facing increased competition from rapidly expanding road traffic. Owing to
excessive staffing and wage rates that far exceed other segments of the labor market, the revenues of HZ
do not cover labor costs. While labor productivity has improved, it remains low. The path to
competitiveness, financial sustainability, and reduced level of financial support from the government
requires HZ to reconfigure i t s technology, network, systems, staffing levels, and investments that increase
railway competitiveness. The next phase of modernization includes actions to privatize or divest all noncore subsidiaries and real estate assets, to expose all internal or external suppliers to competition or
benchmark pricing, to tie all operating subsidies to performance-based contracts and to close
uneconomical lines and recalibrate the railway network to fit traffic demand, shifting the focus toward
European corridors and urban commuter services. New investments will need to focus more on
commercial competitiveness and financing implications as well as be subjected to cost-benefit analysis.
28.
The efficient provision o f energy services i s important for promoting growth and enhancing
Croatia’s ability to compete with the rest of Europe. Croatia covers about 65 percent of i t s power
supply from domestic sources, with roughly half coming from large hydropower plants and the other half
coming from thermal plants and cogeneration. In addition to i t s own sources, it imports another 15
percent of supply annually from the Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia which i s half owned by the
Croatian national power group, HEP. The balance of 20 percent needs to be imported from other sources.
However, with a demand growth of close to 5 percent a year, partly fuelled by the growing tourism and
manufacturing industry, Croatia’s dependence on electricity imports i s going to increase over the coming
years. This raises issues related to energy security and cost of electricity, since regional imports have

22

Rijeka Masterplan Update, April 2008.

10

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
become much more expensive. HEP plans to establish several new gas-fired combined cycle plants
(however, availability of gas will be an issue) and also to use imported coal in a new plant on the coast.

C. Improving Quality and Efficiency in the Social Sectors

29.
To promote a quality of life that i s at par with the rest o f Europe, Croatia will need to
provide its citizens with access to quality schools, health facilities, and social services. While the
quality of social services in Croatia exceed that of many transition countries, the current level and quality
of social services s t i l l fall short o f EU standards and do not entirely meet the needs of the poor.
Moreover, fiscal problems in the pension and health systems can contribute significantly to national
deficits and present growing concerns for an aging population in Croatia.

30.

There i s strong consensus among policymakers that Croatia’s education system needs
further reforms to respond to the needs o f the economy. Croatia has achieved significant progress
under the 2005-20 10 Education Sector Development Plan, which included external assessments and
preparation o f the State Matura, introduction of Croatian National Education Standards in primary
education, and steps towards reducing multiple-shift schools. Croatia also increased public spending on
education over the last five years to about 5 percent o f GDP, similar to new EU members. Still, there i s a
mismatch between skills produced by the education system and those demanded by the market.

3 1.
Croatia also has a high share of students who complete only basic vocational programs at
the secondary level. Croatia has managed to reduce the share of VET students in the total secondary
enrollment24from 71.0 percent in 2004/05 to 69.6 percent in 2007/08, but at a slightly slower pace than
targeted. If this progress i s maintained however, Croatia could reach the 65 percent target level of VET
enrolment by 2010. Life-long learning (adult education) programs exist, but less than 3 percent of the
population subscribe to them. Moreover, Croatia does not have a lifelong learning strategy which could
provide a framework for different forms of education and activities delivered by various providers.

32.
Croatia’s pension system costs 11.5 percent of GDP, one-and-a-half percentage points o f
GDP above the top EU15 spenders. The recent interventions in the pension system, including the
reduction of disincentives for early retirement, are not consistent with the EU efforts to increase labor
force participation and reduce fiscal pressures on the pension system posed by an aging population. In
July 2007, the enactment o f the law on bonuses attempted to reduce the gap between old and new retirees
by raising the benefits of new retirees, but with a consequence of opening a gap for future ones. The July
2007 amendments to the Pension Insurance Law also lowered the penalty rate for early retirement and
raised the minimum and disability pensions, thus reversing some of the achievements of past pension
reforms and reducing incentives for the work force to stay in the labor market. To put pension reforms
back on track, the government will need to take measures to promote fiscal, social, and intergenerational
sustainability in particular through strengthening second pillar funding to prevent low future replacement
rates and eliminate inequities between different pension cohorts.
33.
Croatia’s health spending has been decreasing over time, but remains high compared to
new EU member states. Table 2 shows that Croatia’s overall health spending reached 7.7 percent
of GDP in 2004;’ which compared favorably with countries that joined the EU before May 2004,
but exceeded the spending o f members that joined after 2004.
While this has translated into
24

25

The expected outcomes for the share o f vocational schools/gymnasiums in the total secondary school enrollment have been
reset in order to reflect the ratio targeted in the Education Sector Development Plan 2005 - 2010 (69/31 in 2007 and 65/35
in 2010).
The latest year for which comparable international data exists.

11

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12
relatively strong health indicators, maintaining and improving these achievements will require
enhancements in the health system, particularly with regards to efficiency and financial sustainability.
The health delivery system s t i l l relies heavily on inpatient care treatment, at a time when many countries
are exploiting technological advances to shift to a system where many procedures are treated on an
outpatient basis. While inpatient admissions are in line with EU average, patients tend to stay in hospitals
for extended periods of time. The average length of hospital stay declined during the 1980s and 1990s,
but remained close to 11 days during the last three years-more than double that in the US.
Table 2: Health Spending of Croatia and EU members

Source: WHO, health for all Database. 2004 data
I/ Standardized Death Rates

The current payment system to hospitals lacks incentives to contain spending. The current
34.
system rewards hospitals for keeping beds full and extending lengths of stay, since high occupancy results
in steady funding. Low occupancy rates also increase the risk that the annual contract for the hospital
would be decreased by HZZO, the national health insurance. The current move towards a prospective
case-adjusted payment system represents an important step in rationalizing incentives in the system and
reducing average length of stays. There i s scope for rationalizing and modernizing the hospital
infrastructure. The hospital network consists of a large number o f multi-specialized hospitals in close
catchments areas and few centers of excellence. As a result, small cities/counties’ hospitals are
underutilized, and regional centers and clinical hospitals are overutilized.

35.
Croatia’s social protection system is characterized by rising spending patterns and many
parallel social transfer programs. In 2006, Croatia spent 26 percent of GDP on social programs, which
i s high by international standards, but only a small share (0.6 percent of GDP) supported poverty-related
social assistance program. More than one hundred different non-contributory social benefit programs are
offered at the national and local levels with an overall budget of 4.3 percent of GDP. The large number of
programs, combined with the large number of institutions administering the system and the lack of
unified eligibility criteria, have resulted in a complicated and costly social safety net.
36.
There i s also an increase in the number of young children and young adults who are being
institutionalized. Moreover, many of the institutions are too big (the average capacity of children’s
homes i s 80), and residents tend to stay for long periods. International experience has shown that
community social services, such as day support for the elderly and disabled and foster care for children,
are much less expensive and more effective than residential institutionalization.

37.
The government has a unique opportunity to promote greater social inclusion through social
protection reforms that focus on better targeting; spending less on categorical benefits and more on welltargeted programs like social assistance, to be supported by the introduction of the Personal Identification
Number from 2009 onwards; facilitating the return from “welfare to work”; upgrading the social
assistance information system; and consolidating administration where possible by merging relevant
functions under fewer ministries and single offices at the local levels. The government has already
invested considerable efforts and resources to address particular pockets of poverty including those of

D. Increasing Sustainability of Long Term Development

38.

Croatia's rich natural heritage represents one of its most important assets and a key driver
o f economic development. The country enjoys a unique and well-preserved environment, high level o f
biodiversity and large stores o f fresh water. The degree of environmental protection, however, i s lower
than in other developed countries, primarily due to insufficient investments. Croatia faces substantial
investment needs across all environmental sectors, particularly in the sub-sectors of waste, water,
brownfield remediation, and air. Achieving sustainable development will require balancing the need to
pursue growth while at the same time preservingthe natural environment-a vision which lies at the heart
o f the EU's Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas.

supply and wastewater services in
Croatia are lower than in the recent EU
member countries. Local governments
recognize that protecting the quality o f
seawater for bathing and aquaculture i s
essential for future growth in tourism,
particularly along the Adriatic Coast.
Wastewater collection and treatment i s
even a greater priority, given sewerage
coverage i s about 44 percent with
considerable regional variation. Those
that are not connected to the sewerage
network use septic tanks which often leak,

requirements. The untreated wastewater that i s discharged creates a significant risk o f groundwater,
surface water and sea water pollution. In addition, most o f the existing wastewater treatment plants need
to be upgraded to meet EU environmental standards.
40.
Although Croatia has a wide coverage of municipal waste collection, problems remain with
the organization of regional waste management centers and with illegal dumpsites and
contaminated land. Around 92 percent o f population has municipal waste collection system coverage,
though coverage varies from 70 percent in a few counties to almost full coverage in the city o f Zagreb.26
However, removal o f large number o f “hot spots” or contaminated sites will require significant
investments, as well as the management o f hazardous waste. After remediation, some of these sites may
offer opportunities for private redevelopment and reintegration in their surroundings, which could lead to
improvements in the quality o f life and competitiveness in the vicinity.

4 1.
With more than fifteen central government institutions responsible for environmental
management, organizational reforms are required to increase their effectiveness. The fragmentation
o f the system hinders successful implementation, monitoring, enforcement and reporting of the
environment chapter of the acquis. Reforms are also needed in the area of municipal infrastructure where
large efficiency gains from economies of scale could be achieved through consolidation o f utility services
across the local government units.
42.
Croatia i s situated along the global hotspot for biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin,
with more than 11 percents of i t s land designated as protected areas, which i s still below the EU
average o f 15 percent. As part o f i t s efforts to integrate with the EU Natura 2000 network, Croatia plans
to increase i t s protected areas to the targeted 15 percent. This will require investments for infrastructure,
equipment, capacity-building, data collection, and reporting. The park management plans adopted in
2007 provide a longer term framework for strategic planning and financing which could turn the protected
areas into strong assets for tourism growth.
43.
Similar to other countries in Central and South Eastern Europe, Croatia is prone to a range
o f natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, forest fires, drought, and landslides. This
vulnerability was evident in the summer o f 2007, when forest fires raged along the Adriatic coast,
claiming human lives and destroying wildlife. The impact o f climate change, accompanied by changes in
land use patterns and increased human settlements in disaster-prone areas will magnify the severity and
intensity o f weather-related disasters in the coming years. To protect i t s citizens from severe
consequences of natural disasters, Croatia needs to strengthen i t s natural disaster management.

44.
As with EU member states, adaptation and mitigation o f climate change i s high on Croatia’s
national agenda. Following the ratification o f the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, Croatia faces the challenge o f
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent between 2008 and 2012. The National Strategy on
Climate Change recognizes the critical role the energy sector plays in reaching the 2012 goals. While
Croatia’s energy intensity compares favorably with most countries in Eastern and Southeast Europe, it
remains higher than in Western Europe, including Austria and Slovenia. The national strategy aims to
increase the share o f renewable energy (mainly wind and biomass) in electricity generation to 5.8 percent
by 2010. This will require cogeneration in industry and substitution of fossil fuels with local resources
where possible. Energy efficiency in households through more energy efficient construction and use o f
appliances will also be important. Additional measures will need to be taken to meet the goal o f
increasing the share o f biodiesel and other biofuels in motor vehicle fuels to 5.75 percent.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
45.
Achieving sustainable development will require tackling disparities in living conditions
across regions. The economies o f the most developed counties-Zagreb,
Istria, and PrimorskoGoranska-have
large services sectors, active small- and medium-sized enterprises, and large-scale
entrepreneurs, and are well positioned t o continue to grow rapidly. Counties in Adriatic Croatia appear to
be similarly w e l l positioned, and are likely to benefit from continued rapid growth in tourism and
improved transport access. By contrast, counties in Eastern and Central Croatia have a less favorable
economic structure, with a relatively large share o f agriculture, and face a significant risk o f lagging
further behind.

46.
Structural challenges in the agriculture sector have contributed to regional gaps in living
standards. Croatia has not achieved a complete transition in farming, and as a result private farms are
operating on small, fragmented lands, with limited capacity to achieve economies o f scale. The average
farm size i s half that in the EU. Agro-kombinats and cooperatives are struggling to respond to the new
economic environment, with production levels s t i l l below pre-independence levels. The state retains
equity in some agro-kombinats, which have applied survival strategies based on payment arrears, soft
state budgets, and bad debts - all ultimately delaying their restructuring.

47.
To reduce regional and rural-urban disparities, Croatia will need to embrace a regional
development policy that supports sustainable use o f natural resources, which includes a climate change
adaptation agenda; promotes social cohesion and regional integration to expand the benefits o f growth;
and invests in human capital.

additional provisions set forth in the loan agreement. The public
finance management framework provides solid basis for the Bank’s
increased use o f country systems, supported by stable development in
portfolio financial management and financial performance over the last
years. Harmonization with the EU, both in legislation and in practice,
has advanced, though various budgetary functions require further
development. Country systems for financial management are used in
several Bank-funded projects, including for audits, since the State Audit
Office meets the auditing standards required for Bank-funded projects.

management staff, a skills gap analysis i s needed to help build civil

enhanced i t s coordination with the EC Delegation to help the country implement the accession
requirements, and support institution building to better absorb EU grant flows.
Box 3: Results at a Glance
(1) Economic Stability and Sound Economic Management
Reduced public debt: Public debt was reduced from 5 1% o f GDP in 2003 to 47% in 2007, accompanied by a reduction o f
general government expenditures by 3 percentage points o f GDP.
Subsidy cuts: Subsidies to companies were reduced from 3.4% o f GDP in 2003 to 2.3% in 2006, including the reduction o f
operating subsidies to the railways by 0.7 percentage points o f GDP.
Enhancedpublicfinance management. The Treasury Single Account was expanded to cover the bank accounts o f all line
ministries and extra-budgetary funds. Internal audit and control system was established.
Public administration reforms: Under the new civil service legislation, assistant ministers and deputy state secretaries,
among other top professional positions, are now hired through a competitive selection process.
An effective & accountable judiciary: The court case backlog was reduced by 30% between 2004 and mid-2007, and
indicators o f judicial performance improved.

(2) Strong, Private Sector-led Economic Growth to Raise Living Standards
Greater private sector role in the economy. State shares were divested in over 840 companies, including agro-combinats
and large loss-makers in the metal industry, increasing the private sector’s share in the economy to 70%.
Reduced transaction cosfs. Backlogs in land registry was reduced by more than 60% since 2003; 40 out o f 90 Land
Registry Offices have no backlogs and can now register property transactions in 7 days. Modernization o f customs has
helped reduce delays at border crossings and inland terminals by 65% between 2000 and 2005.
Making Croatia a more attractive trading route: The restructuring o f Croatia’s biggest port in Rijeka improved its
efficiency with port traffic doubling from 2.5 million tons in 2000 to 5.0 million tons in 2006. Container traffic increased
eight-fold in only five years.

(3) Broad Participation in the Benefits o f Growth
Enhanced qualify of education. Reconstruction o f 72 schools i s helping reduce multiple shift schools and improving quality
o f education. Over 600 primary and secondary schools received didactic equipment, making learning more effective.
Improved healfh care. I n Zagreb, average response time o f emergency medical services was reduced from 30 to 9 minutes.
Over 1,700 tons o f pharmaceutical waste and old medicine were cleared and removed in a safe manner to protect the
environment and eliminate health hazard.
Support to vulnerable groups. Seven o f the 65 planned social welfare homes were upgraded, improving the living and
working conditions for beneficiaries and staff.

(4) Protection o f the Environment and Preservation of Croatia’s Natural Resources
Clearing of landmines. Six million square meters o f land in war-affected areas were cleared, and rural communities in
Eastern Slavonia and Baranja could restart agricultural activities and tourism-related businesses.
Increased flood protecfion and wastewater management. Wastewater treatment plants were restored or built, and
wastewater collection systems were extended to cover 9 additional municipalities. Now 85% of the population o f the
Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem region has access to wastewater services.
Environmental protection and reduced energy costs. A new company HEP ESCO was established to support the private
sector in undertaking energy efficiency projects. I n the town o f Novigrad 2,300 old street lamps were replaced by new
energy efficient ones, reducing the town’s energy costs and light pollution.
Preserving nature. Some 8,000 sq. km. o f the karst eco-ecosystem are now under the surveillance o f trained park staff.

49.
Portfolio performance fluctuated during the CAS period. With more than one-third of
commitments at risk in FY04, the Bank prepared project improvement plans, which led five
unsatisfactory projects to be upgraded during FY05. In order to improve portfolio performance, regular
Joint Portfolio Reviews (JPR) were organized. These reviews identified several factors contributing to
slow project implementation, including effectiveness delays, weak implementation capacity and lack of
familiarity with Bank procedures, as well as complexity of project design and inadequate project
readiness. Corrective measures have been adopted following each JPR. The government acknowledged
the JPR as a useful monitoring tool and introduced a systemic annual review of all IF1 portfolios as a

16

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
statutory requirement. As a result o f this collaborative approach, none of the projects in the portfolio
closed with unsatisfactory rating, though several closed with moderately satisfactory rating. The current
portfolio includes two moderately unsatisfactory operations and several moderately satisfactory projects
that require close monitoring.
50.
The latest JPR, held in March 2008, proposed a set of measures to boost portfolio
performance, including strengthening implementation capacity and the provision o f adequate
counterpart funds. These measures have been adopted by the government, and the Ministry o f Finance
has engaged in intensive monitoring o f its implementation. The government monitoring mechanisms will
be further strengthened by increased supervision by the Ministry o f Finance whose staff will join the
Bank’s supervision missions for select projects. These efforts complement the monitoring and evaluation
training provided by the Bank in 2007 to increase the capacity of project implementation teams for
monitoring the progress o f activities. The Ministry o f Finance and the Bank also agreed to engage in
regular follow-up to the JPR during the course o f the year.

During the CAS period, I F C supported post-privatization restructuring in key sectors with
a focus on tourism, agribusiness/food processing, SMEs and trade facilitation. It made substantial
investments in two local companies to strengthen their corporate governance and environmental standards
and boost their competitiveness in the region: Agrokor, the largest regional food and beverage company;
and Adriatic Luxury Hotels (ALH), a pioneer in reestablishing Croatia’s tourism industry. The
government also requested IFC assistance in improving the quality of regulations on the start up and
operation of businesses. This resulted in the government taking steps to eliminate or simplify more than
half o f all business regulations. As of June 2008, IFC‘s total commitments reached US$365 million,
allocated in agribusiness (34 percent), in general manufacturing (33 percent), and in the financial markets
(33 percent). During FY04-08, IFC committed US$3 14 million and mobilized $25.6 million through
syndicated banks. In addition, IFC financed US$84 million in regional projects in Southeast Europe
region, including Croatia. During the CAS period, MIGA’s guarantees portfolio declined sharply as a

progressed in i t s EU accession process. As of June 2008, MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in Croatia
amounted to about US$17 million, equivalent to 0.3 percent o f MIGA’s gross portfolio.

B. Lessons Learned
52.
A number of important lessons relevant for the design of the new CPS emerged from the
CAS Completion Report. First, a more flexible CAS structure would be appropriate going
forward. When the CAS was originally designed, Croatia had high and progressively growing external
debt, large fiscal deficit and a lapsed IMF program (new IMF Stand-by Arrangement was signed in
August 2004), and there was an expressed desire on the part o f the government to have a strong World
Bank program to support policy reform efforts. The combination of these factors led to a tightly-designed
CAS with detailed triggers moving the program from one scenario to the other.

53.
Many important reforms have been implemented under the PAL program as described in
the CAS Completion Report. However, there has been hesitation or even backtracking at times,
especially in the period leading to the parliamentary elections. This created uncertainty about the fate
and timing o f some investment projects included in the base and high case scenarios for several
counterparts, which had limited or no impact on the implementation of the PAL program. These
uncertainties have created difficulties in managing relationships and planning implementation o f those
projects. Furthermore, Croatia has maintained strong macroeconomic performance and solid economic
growth for a prolonged period o f time, and the Bank’s contribution to Croatia’s external financing needs
was rather modest. Thus the lesson for the new CPS i s that Croatia will benefit from continued intensive
analytical and advisory work and a focused program of investment loans and other non-policy based
instruments. These will not depend on but will be complemented, as warranted, by single-tranche DPLs
in areas where opportunities arise, and where there i s strong political support and government
commitment, and the coordination o f cross cutting reforms i s ensured.
54.
Second, the PAL program was designed to support a broad and politically difficult reform
agenda. While some of the planned actions represented first generation reforms (such as the reduction of
subsidies, privatization o f companies in the competitive sector), taken together, they comprised a
politically and socially difficult package (from restructuring o f the railways company to the reform o f
social benefits and the privatization of shipyards). The government and the Bank both believed and
continue to believe that these reforms are important priorities, but full implementation has proven
difficult. Going forward, Croatia’s reforms may be better supported by DPLs that focus on a more
narrowly defined agenda. Such DPLs would support an overall medium-term reform program through a
series of single tranche loans with clearly responsible and accountable government counterparts.
55.
Third, effectiveness delays and uneven implementation progress of projects was reflected in
relatively slow disbursements and require actions on both sides. On the Bank’s side, ensuring
implementation readiness o f projects, including the availability of implementation capacity and the
preparation o f procurement documents, remains crucial. As for the authorities, reducing the processing
time for project effectiveness, allocating necessary resources to create implementation capacity and
strengthening the Ministry of Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-a-vis the implementing
agencies, could help improve project performance and accelerate the flow o f funds.
C. Strategic Objectives of the New CPS

56.
The goal of the CPS i s to support the completion o f Croatia’s EU accession process, the
rapid convergence o f its income level with that of the current EU member states in a fiscally,
socially and environmentally sustainable fashion, and a decent quality of life for Croatia’s citizens.

18

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12
This overarching goal i s fully in line with the government’s priorities expressed in various government
programs, including the Program o f the Government o f the Republic o f Croatia for the 2008-2011
Mandate, the National Program for EU accession, the Pre-accession Economic Program 2008-20 10 and
the Strategic Development Framework for 2006- 13, In order to support the achievement of this goal, the
Bank Group program will aim at contributing in the four identified areas of emphasis: (i)sustaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with
the EU; (iii)improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and (iv) increasing the
sustainability of long-term development. The EU accession agenda will remain a cross-cutting theme in
the design and implementation o f the Bank Group’s program.

57.
The results framework for the CPS reflects an effort to link the Bank Group activities to the
development objectives the government wants to achieve in the CPS period. However, this
framework has important limitations. First, there i s tension between the notion o f pre-defined outcomes
and the needed flexibility o f Bank Group engagement in an advanced middle-income country that i s on
the verge o f EU accession. Second, the Bank’s lending represents a small part o f Croatia’s external
financing and public expenditure, and the Bank Group contribution, while potentially important, would
affect only a part o f Croatia’s overall economic agenda. Nonetheless, a serious effort has been made to
create a results framework, building on results that are expected to be achieved through the
implementation of the current portfolio and new activities o f which there i s a clear agreement. If
significant changes occur in the overall program, the results framework will be adjusted in the CPS
Progress Report. The results framework, including the key expected CPS outcomes and indicators, are
summarized in Annex 1,
D. Overall Approach
58.
The design and implementation of the program will be demand-driven and flexible. As
envisaged under the Bank Group’s Middle-Income Countries agenda, the CPS represents a broad
framework in which the Bank Group can flexibly respond to emerging priorities in a timely fashion. In
doing so, the Bank Group will seek to mobilize the best available technical expertise, international
experience, and a wide range o f Bank Group instruments. The program i s defined for the first two years
of the CPS period, and will be adjusted to respond to Croatia’s emerging needs at the time o f the CPS
Progress Report.
59.
I n order to reconcile the dual objectives of flexibility and selectivity, and to operate within
the available resource envelope, the lending program has been divided into two parts. The first part
(Part I)represents activities for the first two years where there i s clear agreement with the authorities to
proceed, including on the content o f the proposed operations. Several projects in this part o f the program
have already been prepared under the previous CAS, with about one-half representing additional
financing or repeater-type projects. A l l projects will be subjected to the development effectiveness test.
60.
The second part (Part II)of the program includes equally important areas of engagement
that require further dialogue and groundwork with the government. These areas o f priorities fall
into two main categories. The first includes possible investment projects in railways and the energy
sector where appropriate strategies and/or investment plans need to be defined to allow for Bank
financing. The second category includes possible development policy lending that could support two sets
o f reforms - governance and anti-corruption measures; and measures that encourage private sector
growth through continued fiscal consolidation, improved quality o f public expenditures, and investment
climate reforms. In both areas, the Bank will continue with a program o f AAA and dialogue and will
assess progress that might warrant development policy lending, if the authorities so wish. Development
policy lending, if any, will be used selectively in well-defined areas where government commitment to
reform i s strong and based on actual reform performance, leading to better governance, improved

19

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12
competitiveness, continued fiscal adjustment and reduced external and long-term vulnerabilities.
Maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic performance, characterized by continued fiscal
consolidation towards the government’s target o f a balanced budget, as well as broad progress on the
structural reform agenda without major policy reversals will be a prerequisite for any development policy
lending.

61.
A joint program with the I F C i s planned, based on a shared strategy. The Bank and IFC
have been working together in the area o f sub-national finance and will continue to do so in supporting
private sector investments and PPP solutions in infrastructure in particular. IFC’s focus on postprivatization restructuring in priority sectors will complement the Bank’s efforts to support enterprise
privatization under the PAL program. The Bank’s work on broader investment climate issues and support
for reforms in this area, are also being complemented by IFC’s Regulatory Reform project. Finally, IFC’s
support for domestic companies to increase their competitiveness and efficiency and to implement best
practices in corporate governance, environmental and social standards, will contribute to the broader
competitiveness and EU accession agenda which i s supported by both the Bank and the IFC.
62.
I n the selection and design o f operations, primary consideration will be given to how the
proposed project supports Croatia’s EU accession agenda. I n the case of social sectors where there
i s no EU acquis, consideration will also be given to how projects complement EU accession efforts.
This assessment will be made together with the authorities and in close collaboration with the EC.
Project components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, especially following accession,
will have high priority.
E. Areas of Engagement

63.
The envisaged Bank Group operational program will support, in a selective fashion, the
government’s main strategic priorities in the context of Croatia’s EU accession process:

(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

sustaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening private sector led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;
improving quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and
increasing the sustainability o f long-term development.

Pillar 1: Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability

64.

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to:
0
Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f public finances; and
0
Strengthen financial sector supervision.

65.

Enhancing the effectiveness and the efficient management of public spending i s important
for strengthening the economy’s ability to withstand external shocks and improving
competitiveness. The government recognizes that a smaller public sector, as well as improved
composition and efficiency o f public spending are necessary for the reduction o f Croatia’s external
vulnerability, for private sector growth and for sustainable, strong economic growth. The improved
effectiveness o f public expenditures and public sector efficiency more broadly will continue to have high
priority in the Bank Group’s program. Programmatic analytical work on public expenditures i s
envisaged, covering the medium-term expenditure framework, the public investment program,
institutional issues, performance-based budgeting, as well as specific sectoral public expenditure reviews.
This, combined with analytical work on governance described in paragraph 67, could help define the
agenda for a possible public sector DPL. Debt management products may also be used to improve the
efficiency o f public finances.

20

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

66.
Further strengthening o f financial sector supervision at a time of financial market
turbulence i s an important priority. The fast credit growth of the recent past, and the relatively high
currency and interest rate risk of banks require increased bank supervision, while considering effective
measures that can eventually be executed within the EU framework. Also the non-bank financial sector
would benefit from further capacity building o f HANFA. The recent ROSCs on corporate governance,
and accounting and auditing have helped highlight some weaknesses. The gradual elimination o f these
weaknesses would improve the transparency and soundness o f the corporate sector, thus enhancing
companies’ access to credit and banks’ balance sheets. An IDF grant on corporate financial reporting will
support the initial implementation of a long-term strategy and action plan, as well as provide training to
bring the corporate financial reporting framework in line with international standards. Follow-up on the
recently completed joint Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment i s also envisaged. This may include
work on consumer protection in financial services and financial governance in a regional context covering
several Central European and Baltic countries, as well as convergence with EU standards for financial
service industries and their performance.
Pillar 2: Strengthening Private Sector-Led Growth and Accelerating EU Convergence

67.

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to:
Enhance public sector governance;
0
Improve the investment climate; and
0
Align the provision o f infrastructure and related services with demand.

68.
Strong public sector governance leads to better policies, increased transparency, improved
public service delivery and lower cost o f doing business. Enhancing public sector governance entails
improvements in the effectiveness o f the public administration, in the efficiency o f the judicial system and
law enforcement, and the reduction in corruption. Reform o f the judiciary and public administration i s
also a key condition for Croatia’s EU accession and among the highest priorities o f the government. To
assist the implementation o f the government’s judicial reform and anti-corruption strategies, a Judicial
Reform Project i s being prepared. This project, which would build on the PAL Iand 11, and the recently
completed Court and Bankruptcy Administration Project, will support (i)the strengthening of judicial
administration and court management; (ii) rationalization o f the court network; and (iii) automation of
courts to help the implementation o f integrated case management. Based on the results achieved in the
reform of land registration and cadastre, this area may receive further support as part o f the efforts to
strengthen the judiciary and public administration. To complement the analytical work on public
expenditures described in paragraph 64, AAA in select issues o f public sector governance to support
policy making and the preparation of a public sector DPL i s envisaged. Policy notes may cover public
expenditure management in the judiciary, and governance and anticorruption. A public sector DPL could
address further rationalization o f the structure o f public administration, strengthening the civil service
management and reward system, enhancing the professional development o f civil servants, strengthening
strategic planning and policy coordination, rationalization o f the court system, the development of an
effective accountability and performance monitoring mechanism in the judiciary, and further
improvements in public finance management and transparency. The Bank may also explore the
possibility o f designating Croatia as a focus country for governance-centered grant support, including
through the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). The grant financing would support Croatia’s
governance and anti-corruption priorities, especially those outlined in the National Anti-Corruption
Strategy and which are relevant for EU accession,
69.
Further improvement in the investment climate would lead to increased competitiveness,
and thus faster convergence of incomes toward EU levels. Croatia stands to benefit from continued
increase in the private sector’s share in the economy, currently at 70 percent, through the rapid

21

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
completion o f the privatization program and the entry o f new private enterprises (local and foreign), the
lowering of the cost o f doing business, and the reduction of the large informal sector, estimated at
between 15 and 30 percent o f GDP. The EU Convergence Report, which i s being finalized in close
collaboration with Croatian counterparts, will analyze the key constraints to improved competitiveness o f
the Croatian economy and provide recommendations in the areas o f regulation, labor market and
education, trade and infrastructure. Select follow-up work on competitiveness issues i s envisaged. This
will likely be in partnership with the National Competitiveness Council, a four-partite body, including
senior representatives from the government, employers, trade unions and academia. Furthermore, a DPL
which could build on the recommendations of the EU Convergence Report, might be developed if there i s
interest and strong commitment by the government and an appropriate coordination mechanism i s in
place. The DPL may support continued fiscal consolidation through progress in the quality o f fiscal
adjustment, improvements in the investment climate, the completion o f the privatization process, and the
strengthening of the regulatory framework. IFC’s future activities will continue to focus on postprivatization restructuring in priority sectors; helping domestic companies to become regionally
competitive; and promoting local bond market and secondary capital market development.

I

Box 4: I F C Strategy in Croatia
In line with its strategy in middle-income countries, IFC will seek opportunities to support creditworthy
second tier companies in Croatia’s economically depressed regions. IFC will offer new products to i t s
largedfirst tier clients and tap into their supply chain as well as continue to support their further modernization and
expansion into higher value-added products and/or South-South investments. IFC w i l l focus on selective sectors
and activities such as agribusiness, information and communication technology, construction materials, tourism,
infrastructure (ports, oil/gas pipelines, power generation), financial markets and regional projects. Through advisory
services, IFC will promote private sector participation in the infrastructure sectors. Addressing climate change, IFC
may focus on four products: energy efficiency, renewable energy, cleaner production, and recycling. If market
conditions deteriorate, either due to domestic factors or due to negative international credit market contagion, IFC
will look for opportunities to support alternative funds mobilizations and funding base diversification (syndication,
parallel facilities, local secondary capital market development including local bond market). Also, IFC will seek
investment opportunities with financial institutions to improve the range o f financial products delivered particularly
to SMEs, microfinance enterprises and low or middle-income households, while supporting delivery that addresses
sectoral and regional inequalities.

70.
Convergence with the EU and sustained economic growth require integrated infrastructure
and related services working effectively and developing rapidly enough to keep up with increased
demand. Since Croatia has a well-developed infrastructure, the focus i s on improving the network
capacity by addressing remaining gaps, improving integration into the trans-European networks, and
implementing a policy framework conducive for accelerated development of new capacity through
public-private partnership^.^' The government’s plans call for continued upgrading o f the Pan-European
corridors, including the development of railway infrastructure, increasing the capacity of seaports,
building on masterplans recently updated under ongoing projects, expanding energy generation capacity
and improving regional connectivity of the energy system in line with the Energy Community program
for Europe, regionally supported by the Bank. Future Bank and IFC support i s expected to include further
financing for port development through public-private partnerships and related hinterland connections, in
particular to continue the expansion o f capacity in the port o f Rijeka and possibly PloceS3’The Bank and
the IFC are also ready to continue the dialogue with HEP on expanded collaboration in the areas o f
energy generation and/or transmission, in addition to the additional financing for the rehabilitation of the
’O

3’

In the port sector, this entails private investments in superstructure and equipment by concessionaires in line with the Law
on Seaport updated in 2006 and concession fees paid to the port authorities for infrastructure costs.
A t least three port terminals are expected to be put in concession as part o f the ongoing Bank-financed projects over the CPS
period.

22

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
district heating network and energy efficiency investments. Future Bank support may also include
investments in upgrading select railway infrastructure of European significance, in strengthening the
competitiveness o f the railways ahead o f the opening o f its network, and in improving its performance.
Such investments will need to go hand in hand with and support the implementation o f a sound
restructuring program o f the Croatian Railways in coordination with EIB, an important financier of
railway investments. IFC, in close collaboration with the Bank, will continue to promote private sector
investments and PPP in infrastructure through expertise/advisory services and direct funding.
Possibilities for further collaboration with EBRD will be explored. MIGA remains also open to
opportunities to support foreign investment in infrastructure and other sectors though the provision o f
guarantees.

Pillar 3: Improving Quality and Efficiency in the Social Sectors

71.

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to:
0
Increase the sustainability and equity of the pension system;
0
Improve health system efficiency and outcomes;
0
Enhance the education system to support a knowledge-based economy; and
Improve social inclusion and better targeting o f social assistance.

72.
Due to the low labor force participation and aging of Croatian society, ensuring the fiscal
sustainability o f the pension system remains a key challenge. O f course Croatia’s problem i s not
unique, as many countries in Europe and elsewhere face similar issues. In addition to maintaining the
fiscal sustainability o f the system, its social sustainability i s equally important. Thus addressing the low
future replacement rates and the current significant inequities, such as the differences in privileged and
old-aged pensions, i s also a priority. The Bank has mapped out a set o f policy measures in the recent
Public Finance Review that could lead to major improvements in the long-term sustainability o f the
pension system. The Bank i s ready to continue the dialogue on this important matter, and if the
government were to implement some of the key recommendations of the Public Finance Review in the
pension system, support through development policy lending could be envisaged.

73.
I n the health sector, the dual challenge i s to improve the efficiency and outcomes of the
health system. This requires fundamental reforms, including the reduction o f heavy reliance on inpatient
care, rationalization o f the hospital networks, and improvement in the health insurance system. Some
important rationalization measures have already been implemented through the PAL program, and a new
health sector reform strategy i s under design. In addition to the Public Finance Review’s analysis o f
health expenditures, the Bank has offered technical assistance to support the preparation o f this strategy,
changes in the payment mechanisms for hospitals and a plan to improve the quality assurance system.
The Bank i s also carrying out analytical work in the area o f long term care, a pressing issue in a country
with a rapidly aging population. An investment project, the Development o f Emergency Medical
Services and Investment Planning, i s also being finalized to improve the emergency response capacity
throughout Croatia and strengthen the Ministry’s ability to prepare investments. One o f the objectives o f
the operation i s to develop the capacity o f the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare to prepare strategic
plans, necessary to make use o f European Funds (both pre-and post-accession). One such plan would be
the development o f a health facilities masterplan, the implementation o f which could be financed with EU
funds as in other EU countries.

74.
The government attaches high priority to education to support a knowledge-based
economy. Important progress has already been achieved in the implementation o f the government’s
Education Development Plan, such as clearly-defined learning outcomes for primary education,
introduction o f national external assessments and progress in elimination o f triple-shift schools. EU

23

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FYOB-FY12
membership negotiations for Chapter 26-Education and Culture-have been opened and closed in one
day because of the high degree o f harmonization between the Croatian education system and those o f
other European countries. Nonetheless, there i s a need to further increase enrollment and completion
rates in secondary and higher education, and shift focus from narrow vocational programs towards
cultivating skills which are relevant to a dynamic economy and fast-changing labor markets. The Bank
has provided ongoing support, closely aligned with the government’s education strategy, in the context o f
the Education Sector Development Project. Additional financing or a new operation to continue such
support, including a significant increase in single-shift schools i s envisaged during the CPS period. The
Bank will also be ready to continue the dialogue on select issues of education policy, in addition to the
analysis provided in the Public Finance Review and the EU Convergence Report.

75.
Improving social inclusion and better targeting of social assistance are key aspects of
addressing pockets o f poverty and enhancing social cohesion. Better coordinated social policies, the
regular adjustment o f the well-targeted poverty benefits and a shift from the high level o f institutionalized
care are among the key priorities. A new social assistance strategy has been adopted by the government
and its consistent implementation remains important. The Bank i s ready to maintain the dialogue on the
most effective ways to provide social assistance and, if requested, would be ready to further support social
inclusion activities.
Pillar 4: Increasing the Sustainability of Long-Term Development

76.

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to:
Strengthen environment management and nature protection;
Improve natural disaster management;
0
Prepare for adapting to and mitigating climate change; and
0
Reduce regional and urbanhural disparities.

77.
The government recognizes the importance of environment protection and spatial planning
for a higher quality o f life. There has been significant progress in these areas since 2004. Improved
environmental management and implementation of a large investment program are also necessary for
Croatia’s EU accession. Increasing the level o f water and sewage connectivity in line with the’ Water
Management Strategy, increasing the number and quality o f landfills, reducing the fragmentation o f
environmental and spatial management, and increasing the protected areas as well as the preservation o f
ecological networks and their improved management are some of the challenges ahead. Future operations
will include the continuation o f the Coastal Cities Pollution Control program, an APL o f three phases to
support the improvement o f water quality in line with EU environmental directives (like the Urban
Wastewater Directive) in a number o f Croatia’s coastal cities that are also important tourist destinations
and prepare projects for implementation through EU funding. A sub-sovereign loan for the creation o f a
new regional waste management facility i s also envisaged. The program would also include continued
support to protect Croatia’s national and nature parks, following a successful GEF grant for the protection
o f the karst ecosystem. A multi-country study that analyzes options for reducing the carbon footprint in
the transport system i s also included in the program along with analytical work on brownfield remediation
investments which may lead to project opportunities in the second part of the CPS period.

78.
Improved natural disaster management could save lives and contain the damage caused by
disasters. Croatia i s prone to flooding, drought and forest fires, thus improving emergency preparedness
and response i s a high government priority. Climate change will likely further increase the number and
severity o f natural disasters. The Bank has developed a region-wide natural disaster management facility,
and Croatia i s expected to be one o f the first recipients o f this program. The project may include support

24

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
for disaster risk financing, disaster risk management and adaptation strategy, weather forecasting and
flood early warning, disaster risk mitigation investments and emergency preparedness and response.

79.
Croatia has begun to make plans for adapting to and mitigating climate change. Some o f the
key challenges include limited use o f renewable energy, the high energy intensity o f the economy, and
Croatia’s obligation to reduce greenhouse emission by 5 percent by 2012. UNDP, in collaboration with
the Bank in this year’s Human Development Report for Croatia, will review the impact of climate change
on the country and some select areas where adaptation and mitigation measures could be adopted. The
Bank i s envisaged to finance an investment project for irrigation and flood protection to help increase
agricultural productivity and protect areas from flood damage in the context o f climate change.
80.
Despite its relatively small area, Croatia has significant regional disparities. The government
has begun to strengthen its regional development strategy and coordination, and this will become
increasingly important for the future use o f EU regional funds. In addition to regional differences, the
incomplete transition in farming also raises special issues for urban-rural disparities. The Bank has been
supporting regional development through the Social and Economic Recovery Project, not only directly
through investments but also through technical assistance to strengthen policy-making and planning
capacity. The Development o f Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning project also aims
to reduce regional disparities in the medical system’s response to emergencies.
F. Partnerships and Participation

8 1.
The IMF and the Bank will collaborate closely in their efforts to support the Government of
Croatia in undertaking expenditure-led fiscal consolidation, improving tax administration, and
strengthening competitiveness. The authorities successfully completed the latest IMF Stand-by
Arrangement at end-2006, and the IMF now provides policy advice and analysis through i t s surveillance
activities (Article I V consultations and staff visits) and technical assistance. In the period ahead, the Fund
will take the lead in assisting Croatia on issues related to maintaining macroeconomic stability, which i s
key to underpinning sustainable economic growth. In particular, the Fund will focus on monetary and
exchange rate policies, fiscal policy, financial sector stability, and the external sector and Croatia’s
competitiveness. The Bank will take the lead in the policy dialogue on structural and institutional reforms
in a number o f areas, including the judicial system, governance and anti-corruption, the investment
climate, and private sector participation in infrastructure. In the financial sector, the Bank and the Fund
share responsibility and will coordinate their financial sector policy advice to the Croatian authorities,
taking into account the division o f labor and each institution’s areas o f responsibility in preparing the
recent FSAP update.
82.
The Bank will continue to cooperate closely with the European Commission (EC) in
assisting Croatia with complementary projects and analytical and advisory services to facilitate
accession to the EU and build capacity to use EU structural and cohesion funds. The cooperation with the
European Commission will focus on complementing the EU funds from the Instrument for Pre-Accession
(PA). Approximately EUR570 million i s being made available through P A funding to Croatia in 20072010. The Bank has already provided opportunities under i t s investment operations to finance project
preparation for upcoming IPA funding, and will remain open to similar facilities in the future. Given that
IPA funds represent relatively a small portion o f resources needed for heavy investments per acquis
requirements, the Bank aims to engage in close coordination and division o f labor (such as co-financing
with IPA) to maximize impact. A detailed description o f collaboration between the Bank and the EU i s
included in Annex 2.
83.
The Bank’s program of assistance i s also coordinated with key European financial
institutions such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and

25

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FYOB-FY12
Development. This cooperation i s also facilitated by the Joint European Commission/World Bank Office
for Southeast Europe based in Brussels, which i s serving as the secretariat o f the IF1 Advisory Group and
co-chaired by the EC.32
84.
Close cooperation with UN agencies, namely UNDP and UNHCR, will continue to focus on
economic and social revitalization, as well as rural and regional development, which are high on the
development agenda to support the equitable growth o f underdeveloped areas in the country. Going
forward, sustainable development, cross-compliance with the environment acguis, and a broader social
inclusion agenda are some o f the areas that will require active engagement with the UNDP.

85.
I n preparation for the CPS, a series of meetings and consultations were held across the
country. The consultations, which took place in May 2008, in Zagreb, Rijeka, Sibenik, Varaidin and
Vukovar included representatives of local authorities, the business community as well as nongovernmental organizations to solicit their views and opinions on development priorities and challenges
facing Croatia during the next four years. A summary o f these consultations i s included in Annex 4.
86.
I n addition, a client survey was conducted in February 2008, in which stakeholders were
invited to share their opinions on Croatia’s development priorities and the Bank’s assistance. A
total o f 207 stakeholders-most o f whom were familiar with or have interacted with the Bank-took part
in the survey by completing questionnaires. Participants were drawn largely from government ministries,
NGOs, private sector, and academia; bilateral and multilateral agencies; and the executive offices.
87.
Economic growth, followed by government effectiveness and governance, emerged overall
as the most important development priorities in the client survey. Corruption, though less of a
concern in general, was the most important development priority cited by NGOs, while other respondents
ranked EU accession and government effectiveness/governance high on their list of concerns. World
Bank support in Croatia was viewed positively with most stakeholders welcoming Bank financing in the
key priority areas. Education and corruption-which incidentally were not cited as major development
priorities-were also identified as area that would benefit from Bank resources. In contrast, only a small
share o f respondents believed Bank resources should be channeled towards helping Croatia prepare for
EU accession. Where research was concerned, respondents indicated that Bank involvement would be
most valuable in the areas o f private sector development, education, labor markets, public sector
performance, and anti-corruption.

88.
According to the client survey, the Bank’s knowledge was seen by stakeholders as its most
valuable asset, followed by its financial resources and convening power. The Bank was also seen as
responsive, straightforward and respectful to stakeholders. However, the survey also revealed that the
Bank was perceived as being too bureaucratic in its policies and procedures, and that it supported
technocratic solutions without due regard to political realities. Going forward, the Bank i s expected to
play a somewhat significant role in Croatia’s development in the medium term. Respondents indicated
the Bank could bring greater value by focusing primarily on complex and difficult issues and reducing the
complexity o f obtaining Bank financing.
G. Bank Financial Support and Creditworthiness Considerations
89.
The CPS envisages an indicative base case lending envelope of about US$1.0-1.4 billion over
the four-year period. Since Bank lending will be demand-driven, annual amounts could fluctuate
32

In addition to the IBRD, EIB, EBRD and CEB, the Advisory Group also includes IFC, Black Sea Trade and Development
Bank, KfW (Germany) and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.

26

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
significantly across fiscal years. The base case lending program would only include non-policy based
operations. This program could be complemented with a series o f one-tranche DPLs, especially in
support o f reforms in the public sector and to improve Croatia’s competitiveness, as opportunities arise
and government commitment i s ensured. With DPLs, under an upside scenario, lending could reach
US$1.4-1.8 billion during the CPS period. The upside scenario would be supportive of, and consistent
with, the use of DPLs as elaborated in paragraph 59. It would be characterized by strong government
commitment to reform based on actual performance, including improved governance, enhanced
competitiveness, continued fiscal consolidation towards the government’s target of a balanced budget, and
reduced external and long-term vulnerabilities supported by broad progress on the structural reform
agenda without major policy reversals. Traditional IBRD loans are likely to be supplemented by other
IBRD instruments, such as disaster and catastrophe risk insurance, catastrophe risk deferred drawdown
option, sub-national lending and debt management products.

90.
Table 4 summarizes the indicative program for the first two years o f the CPS. The content o f
the program for the second part o f the CPS period and the overall size o f Bank assistance will be
reviewed and revised as appropriate in the CPS Progress Report at mid-term o f the CPS.

The Bank’s lending program during the past CAS period led to an increase in Croatia’s
outstanding debt (DOD) to IBRD by some US$516 million between end-FY04 and end-FYOS (or
US$245 million between CY04 and CY07). This increase has modestly affected the exposure indicators
as shown in Table 5; debt service to the Bank remained below six percent on average of Croatia’s public
sector debt service throughout the period. The increase in exposure has been carefully managed as Bank
lending has been closely associated with the implementation o f economic reforms. At the end o f FY08,
the level o f DOD ( U S $ I .3 billion) was below the amount projected in the original CAS (US$1.5 billion),
reflecting the lower than originally expected level of development policy lending in the CAS period due
to a slower reform path.
92.
The anticipated lending volumes for the FY09-12 CPS are based on Croatia’s historical
lending levels and absorption capacity, and the government’s borrowing needs from I F I s . Croatia

27

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
has maintained relatively favorable access to international capital markets for over a decade. However,
the rating agencies have been slow to signal improvement in Croatia's sovereign rating due to the
deterioration in the country's external vulnerability, notwithstanding i t s progress towards EU accession.
In order to assist the authorities in this environment, the CPS provides a spectrum o f IBRD lending,
where higher lending volumes would result from possible development policy lending that would support
key policy reforms that enhance macroeconomic stability and mitigate risks. In particular, development
policy lending would take place in an environment of continued fiscal consolidation and reduced external
vulnerabilities, as described in paragraph 59. If the macroeconomic situation were to significantly
deteriorate, measured by widening fiscal deficits and further increase in Croatia's external vulnerabilities,
the lending levels under the base case will be revisited. In any event, a review o f the program, including
lending levels and risks, will take place after two years in the CPS Progress Report.

Croatia's creditworthiness in terms of
access to international capital markets has
remained relatively stable over the previous CAS
period with robust growth performance and a
sharp increase in private capital inflows. Prospects
for EU and NATO accession, a reasonable record in
business environment reforms and privatization have
boosted private sector investment. This, on the other
hand, has also contributed to larger private sector
imbalances and a rise in indebtedness. Fiscal
consolidation efforts have imDroved Dublic sector
savings and have helped reduce public sector debt to
below 48 percent o f GDP. The short-term position o f
the economy remains reasonably safe, and there has

been only limited impact so far from the global financial turmoil. Such impact through the trade channel
i s expected to be limited for Croatia compared to i t s EU peers, given that the current growth has been
mostly driven by domestic, and to a lesser extent, external demand. The exports-to-GDPratio amounts to
approximately 50 percent o f GDP, which i s at the low end among the new member states o f the EU, while
the EU25’s share in Croatia’s trade stagnates at roughly 63 percent, and i s less than that o f the new
member states.

I

94.
Given Croatia’s external imbalances, the global financial turmoil may have a more
significant impact through capital flows. Croatia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 95.7 percent at
end-2007 in US$ terms,33while the external debt-to-exports o f goods and services ratio was close to 195
percent. Both almost doubled since the end o f the 1990s. The currency composition o f total external debt
at the end o f 2007 showed that over three-fourths was euro-denominated debt and therefore, the kuna/US$
exchange rate appreciation contributed to an increase in external debt expressed in US$ by 25.5 percent,
while in euro terms the increase was 12.5 percent compared to end-2006. The significant growth in
external debt i s closely related to the deterioration o f the current account deficit which averaged 6.1
percent o f GDP in the 1999-2006 period, surging to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2007. However, the maturity
structure of Croatia’s external debt i s relatively favorable as short-term debt makes up for around 13
percent o f total debt. Gross international reserves coverage stood at 5.6 months o f imports o f goods and
services in 2007. The relatively high international reserves and banks’ foreign assets provide for a
relatively favorable estimate of net external indebtedness which reached 50.9 percent o f GDP at end2007.
95.
Positive developments in the real sector will likely continue during the CPS period, as
shown in the projections o f key macroeconomic indicators, with economic growth expected to
average around five percent in the medium term. The 2008-2012 growth projections are underpinned
by (i)the assumption o f Croatia’s EU accession in 201 1; (ii)improved macroeconomic stability, which
would stimulate private investment, particularly greenfield investments; (iii)stronger export performance;
and (iv) narrowing public sector size which will create new opportunities for private sector growth. This
i s in line with the plans indicated in the Program o f the Government of the Republic o f Croatia for the
2008-201 1 Mandate. Inflation i s projected to grow by 6 percent in 2008, primarily as a result of higher
inflation carried over from 2007 and further increase in food and oil prices. The kuna to euro exchange
rate will remain relatively stable with pressures on the real appreciation to continue. Lower inflation i s
expected for 2009-2012 as the negative impact on the supply side gradually disappears. Further fiscal
consolidation towards a balanced budget by 201 1, with ambitious spending restraint and a reduction of
tax burden will contribute to a fall in public debt to below 35 percent o f GDP. The current account deficit
i s set to decline slowly but to levels s t i l l significantly above those observed in the first half o f the decade,
reflecting private sector investments and the increased cost o f oil imports. FDI inflows are to remain
strong at above four percent of GDP on average, but less robust than in 2006-2007 when the privatization
of oil and telecom monopolies took place. Financial risks arising from the deterioration in global investor
sentiment are likely to remain moderate, given strong FDI inflows but high current account deficit,
reliance on borrowing from foreign banks and moderate liquidity among domestic banks.
96.
Under the upside lending scenario, Bank exposure might reach USN.7 billion by end-2012.
Such an outcome would reflect Croatia’s strong reform performance, faster disbursement including o f
development policy loans, and the resulting improvement in Croatia’s creditworthiness. Croatia’s external
debt burden remains substantial, with a debt service to exports of goods and services ratio of about 34.7
percent (see Table 5), but projected to decline below 30 percent by the end of the CPS period. During the
CPS period, the country’s medium and long-term external borrowings i s expected to average about 12
percent o f GDP, o f which around 2 percent may be covered by IBRD (see Table 6). Debt service to
33

External debt in EUR terms stood at 89.1 percent in 2007, due to the depreciation o f the US dollar.

29

I

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
preferred creditors as a share of external public debt service i s expected to be about 10 percent during the
CPS period, while the IE3RD debt service as a percentage o f exports of goods and services will remain
low, at around 0.4 percent throughout the CPS period.

H. Risks
97.

There are three main sources o f risks:
0

External vulnerability;
Uneven reform performance; and
Capacity weakness.

98.
Croatia remains vulnerable to contagion from adverse external developments. With an
external debt-to-GDP ratio o f 95.7 percent and a current account deficit o f 8.6 percent at end-2007,
Croatia remains exposed to unfavorable external developments, as described in the section on recent
economic developments. Notwithstanding the above, the country has so far weathered the financial
turbulence that followed the collapse of the sub-prime market in the US, although some signs o f weakness
have emerged, including a widening o f international bond spreads. It has also remained largely unaffected
declaration of independence, although tourism revenues may suffer in the summer. This
by KOSOVO’S
shows that Croatia’s economic fundamentals have improved over time, its EU accession process i s seen
as a solid anchor by external financiers and that macroeconomic policies have remained largely on track.
The implementation of reforms under the PAL program over the past 3 years has contributed to improved
macroeconomic stability. Continued prudent monetary policy and further significant fiscal consolidation
in line with the government’s plan would be necessary for the reduction o f Croatia’s external
vulnerability. Although public sector savings have improved over the past few years, private sector
liabilities have been growing fast, and prudential and administrative monetary measures to halt credit
growth and moderate external imbalances will need to be accompanied by further efforts on the fiscal
policy front.

30

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12
99.
I t i s likely that reform performance will remain uneven. This i s in part because some o f the
reforms, like the restructuring o f railways and shipyards, are politically difficult to implement, and in part
because some of the other reforms, such as the reform o f the judiciary and public administration, are
complex and take time. In addition, the political environment might become more challenging over time
given the realities of the election cycle. There i s also uneven capacity in the administration to design and
implement policies. There are three factors that can help mitigate this risk. First, there are certain areas
where there i s general consensus to proceed. These include, among others, privatization and
improvements in the investment climate. Second, there are several areas where the EU accession
negotiations, the early completion o f which i s one o f the highest priorities o f the government, will
necessitate reform implementation. These include, among others, judicial and public administration
reform, the fight against corruption, state aid and agriculture policies. Third, the government received a
second mandate in the 2007 November elections, and i s clearly aware that there i s now a window o f
opportunity for reforms.
100. Finally, project implementation risks remain. Capacity i s uneven and limited in several
ministries and this may hinder implementation. In part to mitigate this risk, the lending program under
the CPS includes a large number o f repeater-type or additional financing operations. Since such financing
will only be provided for satisfactory projects and the implementation structures are already in place, it i s
expected that project implementation performance will improve across the portfolio. Further efforts will
also be made to ensure implementation readiness o f projects prior to Board presentation. Finally, the
recent training activities in procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and Bank procedures i s also
expected to yield results. As for the authorities, reducing the processing time for project effectiveness,
allocating the necessary resources to create implementation capacity and strengthening the Ministry o f
Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-a-vis the implementing agencies, could help improve
implementation performance. Regular Joint Portfolio Reviews will remain the key instrument for
addressing cross-cutting issues.

IV. Conclusion
101.
Croatia has achieved tremendous political and economic progress over the past 15 years.
Incomes have doubled, and economic and social opportunities have dramatically improved. The Bank
Group has been Croatia’s partner in its post-war recovery, economic transition and development. The
government’s overarching priority i s to complete Croatia’s EU accession process, achieve rapid
convergence o f its income level with that o f current EU member states in a fiscally, socially and
environmentally sustainable fashion that would allow a decent quality of l i f e for Croatia’s citizens. The
Bank i s ready to provide continued support under this Country Partnership Strategy for the achievement
o f this ambitious and worthwhile objective.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
ANNEX 2: COOPERATION W I T H THE EU

As part o f i t s strategy to support Croatia’s pre-accession reform needs, the Bank w i l l continue to
cooperate closely with the European Commission (EC) through complementary projects and analytical
and advisory services. The aim o f this cooperation i s to facilitate accession to and integration with EU, as
well as support capacity-building to use EU structural and cohesion funds.
Looking ahead, the cooperation with the European Commission w i l l focus on complementing the EU
funds from the Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA). Around EUR590 million have been made available
to Croatia through IPA funding in 2007-2010, o f which EUR446.4 million would be allocated through the
Multi-annual Indicative Planning Document for 2008-20 10. Through investment operations, the Bank has
already financed project preparation for upcoming IPA funding, and w i l l remain open to similar facilities
in future. Given that P A funds represent relatively small portion o f resources needed for large
investments per acquis requirements, the Bank aims to closely coordinate the division o f labour (such as
co-financing with P A ) to maximize the donors’ efforts.
EU Assistance to Croatia

In 2007, the EU introduced a new financial assistance program - Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)
- available to Croatia and the neighboring countries, aimed towards preparing the country for EU membership.
IPA has five components which address different and broad areas o f intervention, and also differ on i t s

modalities (such as co-financing and programming procedures). The Multi-annual Indicative Financial
Framework sets the amount of funds available for Croatia (EUR590 million for 2007-2010), while the Multiannual Indicative Planning Document (MIPD) lays out the strategic priority areas in which assistance can be
provided. The operational programs contain the actual projects that are to be financed in each year. Government
plays a critical role in the programming and implementation of the IPA funds, which requires setting up of
appropriate implementing bodies and their accreditation. The areas o f intervention (projects) are developed
jointly between the government and the European Commission, and the process envisages annual consultations
with all stakeholders, including the IFIs. The Bank teams have so far participated in consultations held in
Brussels and in Croatia, and have been able to review and provide comments to updates of MIPDs and
Operational Programs for various IPA components.

In addition to cooperation with the EC, the Bank’s program i s also coordinated with key European
financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. This cooperation i s also facilitated by the Joint European Commission/World Bank
Office for Southeast Europe, based in Brussels, which i s serving as the secretariat o f the IF1 Advisory
Group and co-chaired by the EC34.

The Bank’s priority areas for support include adjustment to pre-accession requirements, including in the
areas o f environment and infrastructure development; support for sustainable agriculture, rural and
regional development, and social development (education and health); and cross-border and regional cooperation. Assistance to strengthen institutions and regulatory frameworks that support the countries’
adoption o f the EC acquis; analytical studies and project preparation are also important areas o f focus.
Both the Bank and the EU’s regular discussions and consultations with the Croatian government address

34

In addition to the IBRD, EIB, EBRD and CEB, the Advisory Group also includes IFC, Black Sea Trade and Development
Bank, KfW (Germany) and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe.

The World Bank has to date provided sizeable support to Croatia through financing projects that help the
country meet EU accession requirements and which are closely integrated into overall country
development plans. There has also been close collaboration with the EC on the PAL program to ensure
alignment with the EU integration agenda in areas such as public administration and judicial reform,
business registration, regulatory framework, and privatization. Some examples o f close collaboration
between the Bank and EC are provided in the box below.

Annex 2

Completed, Ongoing and Proposed Projects and Analytical and Advisory Services
Court and Bankruptcy Administration (completed): modernization o f selected commercial courts and
increasing competence o f judges, other court staff and bankruptcy trustees, as a pilot for broader judicial
reform; Integrated Case Management System (ICMS) developed and piloted/rolled out in several courts
[Pula Municipal Court and Split Commercial Court, Zagreb Commercial Court; testing o f ICMS ongoing
in Zagreb Civil and Penalty Courts); in close coordination with the EU partners, including CARDS
project.
Karst Ecosystem Conservation (completed): institutional development for strengthening administration
for the environment i s a high priority on Croatia’s EU agenda. The project made a substantial contribution
to strengthen this capacity, which helped Croatia during the EU “screening” o f readiness for accession as this sub-sector of the nature protection was considered to be the most prepared. The Conservation and
Rural Revitalization Grants program outcomes and lessons learned are relevant to the design o f EU
agricultural funds programs for rural development (which includes Natura 2000).
Living Standards Assessment (completed): The Living Standards Assessment offered datdanalysis
relevant for the EU Joint Inclusion Memorandum (JIM), and a National Regional Development Strategy
and National Action Plan for Employment; provided recommendations on priorities for government;
among which i s improving the quality and effectiveness o f social safety nets by improving the targeting of
social benefits, to address the issues o f poverty and regional disparities.
Public Finance Review (completed): analysed the fiscal consolidation challenges for Croatia given i t s
accession efforts and explored ways to increase public sector efficiency, using experience from the reform
efforts o f new EU member states. The particular emphasis was given to efficiency and effectiveness issues
in education, pension, health, public administration, transport, subsidies and social benefit programs.
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Accounting and Auditing (A&A) and
Corporate Governance (completed): Assessed regulatory and institutional framework in view o f acquis
requirements on corporate governance, financial reporting and auditing, and follow up on implementation
o f A&A international standards. Carried out jointly by the Bank and the EU, through secondment o f an
official from the DG Internal Market.
Real Property Registration and Cadastre Project (ongoing): EU has directly supported the project and
Croatia’s overall cadastre and land registry reform program through three Bank-administeredtrust funds
(total EUR 1 1.3 million) fully integrated into one operation with the Bank loan (harmonized procurement
and financial management rules); Regular reporting, communication, and coordination among the Bank
team, the EC Delegation office in Zagreb.
Rijeka Gateway Project (ongoing): increasing the country’s trade competitiveness by improving the
international transport chain through the Rijeka Port for both freight and passengers traffic.
Modernizationo f the port into a dominant traffic route in Croatia, connecting seaways with European
road and railway corridors, as well as the traffic growth should make Rijeka one o f the main ports in
Central and Eastern Europe due to established road transport through corridor V. With the accession, it i s
expected that the Croatian economy and its transport system will become an integral part o f the EU
transportation network.

Operational Programs (ROPs) in five counties in the areas o f special state concern, as to support the EU
Regional Development requirements for Croatia; will assist in building capacity for participatory regional
development and for the absorption of pre-accession funds.
Inland Waters (Ongoing): increasing service coverage o f water supply and wastewater collection and
treatment in inland part of Croatia, to enable meeting the EU directives on water and wastewater. The
technical assistance component will assist in building investment pipeline that would be eligible to
receive future EU funds, thus facilitating the absorption of EU grants by Croatia.
G E F Agricultural Pollution Control Project (ongoing) : aims to increase the use of environmentally
friendly agricultural practices by farmers in selected areas to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural
sources to surface and ground water bodies. The project activities are designed to support the country’s
EU accession efforts by assisting the transposition of the Nitrate and Water Framework Directives.
G E F Neretva and Trebisnjica Management Project (ongoing): regional project of Croatia and Bosnia
and Herzegovina aimed at improving water resource management at the Neretva and Trebisnjica river
basins and the transboundary level; aims to maintain and conserve water-dependent ecosystems and
associated biodiversity according to the requirements o f the EU Water Framework Directive and reduce
water pollution to the Neretva and Trebisnjica river basin through high-priority investments in three
municipalities and one industrial sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

EU Convergence Report (ongoing): analyses the current factors and obstacles for faster productivity
growth in Croatia given its EU accession and integration efforts and explores the ways to ensure
sustainability o f long-term growth through increasing flexicurity and generation o f higher-value added,
given the experiences o f the EU and OECD star performers.
Coastal Cities Pollution Control ZZ (proposed): envisages a scaled-up program from 11 to 36
municipalities, aiming to further improve the quality o f Croatia’s coastal waters to meet EU ambient
quality standards. The technical assistance component would aim at financing the preparation of projects

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
ANNEX 3: FINANCIAL SECTOR UPDATE
According to the latest Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update conducted in
October and November 2007, Croatia's financial sector achieved progress since the last 2002
FSAP. Supported by increasingly strong macroeconomic performance, both the banking and
nonbank financial sector have grown significantly, while regulatory and supervisory frameworks
have been strengthened, and financial sector infrastructure has improved as a result o f
harmonization with EU directives.
Indicators o f external and financial vulnerability have been improving ever since 2000. Foreign
banks account for more than 90.8 percent o f bank assets (June 2007), while only two banks
(postal bank included) remain state-owned, accounting for up to 4 percent o f banking assets.
Credit i s comparatively high, at 82 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2007, with more than 92 percent
going to the private sector. Bank capital has been strengthened in recent years with privatization,
and average capital i s now about $208 million (June 2007). Average assets per bank are about
$1,879 million (June 2007). Average interest margin i s declining but s t i l l remains high at 5.9
percentage points (end-2007). Overall, there i s a comparatively high level o f depth and resource
mobilization. Minimum capital adequacy i s 10 percent, and banks are reported to be well
capitalized (at 15.02 percent as per June 2007), and capital amounted to 11.5 percent o f assets.
Non-performing loans further declined to 3.3 percent o f total loans by June 2007, with
irrecoverable placements standing at 1.1, though this indicator needs to be watched carefully,
given i t s backward-looking nature and the rapid growth o f household debt with large unhedged
foreign exchange (FX)-linked component.
Significant market risk remains in the system due to the high level o f foreign currency
borrowings, although declining; at the end o f June 2007, 56.3 percent o f bank placements were
exposed to FX-induced risks. In response, the Croatian National Bank (CNB) has introduced
mandatory monitoring o f F X exposures o f bank clients. F X loans (including loans indexed to
foreign exchange) indeed decreased as a percentage o f total loans from 71.7 percent at the end o f
2006 to 61.4 percent at end.
Financial soundness indicators suggest a reasonably healthy banking sector. Profitability has
fallen slightly in recent years, reflecting the effects o f higher reserve requirements and the
narrowing interest margins under growing competition for market share. The bank supervisory
framework i s broadly in line with international standards and EU Directives. O f particular
importance i s the need to further strengthen effective cooperation between the CNB and home
bank supervisors, including through conduct o f joint on-site inspections o f subsidiaries with
parent bank supervisors. Both the CNB and'major Croatian banks seems to be well-placed to
cope with the implementation o f Basel 11, which w i l l become effective in January 2009. While
the framework for risk-focused supervision i s s t i l l evolving, the current supervisory techniques
and risk management processes do not appear to pose risks for successful Basel I1
implementation.
The capital market i s getting stronger. There i s a high level o f concentration on the main market,
with the top 10 f i r m s in market capitalization accounting for most activity. Market capitalization

42

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 3

grew markedly from around 50 percent at the end o f 2005 to 143 percent o f GDP in 2007, with
the turnover ratio (value o f shares traded as % o f capitalization) o f 16.8 in 2007. While smaller
than the banking sector, the systemic importance o f the nonbank financial sector has increased.
There i s some lack o f clarity on the supervision o f the banking groups that include nonbanking
operations. The framework for securities, insurance and pension regulation and supervision i s
largely in line with international standards, though some weaknesses remain. HANFA, which
was established in 2006 from the merger o f three sectoral regulators, i s coping with many
regulatory and legislative changes in harmonizing with the EU directives. A system o f riskoriented supervision needs to be developed to include monitoring o f risks and identifying
supervisory measures for mitigating them. The reforms initiated in Croatia to address many o f
the governance, accounting, and auditing issues should continue at a robust pace.

ANNEX 4: STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS

As part o f stakeholder consultations for the Country Partnership Strategy, a series o f
meetings were held in M a y 2008 with local authorities, the business community as well as nongovernmental organizations to solicit their views and opinions on development priorities and
challenges facing Croatia. Meetings were held across the country in Zagreb, Rijeka, Sibenik,
Varaidin and Vukovar.

The following issues were identified as key development challenges by the participants:

0

EducationAabor market. Most participants noted that education reform i s one o f the
highest priorities for Croatia. The general feeling was that there i s a high level o f inertia in
the education system, particularly in vocational education, where many felt that skills were
not responding to the needs o f the labor market. From the onset, students enrolled in
vocational study programs know that once they graduate their chances o f finding
employment would be limited, since skills acquired are outdated. O n the other hand, the
tertiary education system i s not appropriately adopted to the needs o f the labor market either
as many graduates face difficulties in finding employment upon completing their studies,
while certain sectors suffer from shortage o f workers with appropriate skills. Double shift
and triple shift schools in primary education need to be eliminated faster, and schools need to
be equipped with appropriate learning tools.
Equitable regional development. Equitable development ranked high on the l i s t o f
priorities for all participants since Croatia is characterized by diverse development across
regions, ranging from very developed regions to those s t i l l suffering from the consequences
o f war, In the richer counties, there was a feeling o f resentment for the government’s lack o f
support, while participants in war-affected parts o f the country wanted more financial and
strategic support. Clearance o f all mines was considered a prerequisite for economic
revitalization in war-affected areas, and led to calls for speedier de-mining efforts and more
funds for this important activity. Another prerequisite for economic revitalization in waraffected areas was the development and implementation o f a comprehensive national
regional development strategy. Participants from the war affected regions were concerned
about the future, especially given the high levels o f migration o f young people (depopulation) due to lack o f employment opportunities. Participants argued that more attention
should be devoted to encouraging rural development, not exclusively linked to agricultural
activities, but also to activities such as eco-tourism, which would increase the quality o f life
in villages, create employment for young people and discourage migration to bigger urban
areas. For this to happen, participants indicated that assistance in capacity building would be
highly appreciated. In addition, participants felt that they were not included enough or at all
in the decision making processes o f the central government. They called for more
cooperation between local authorities and central authorities, as well as inclusion o f other
stakeholders in these processes. Overall, it was noted that throughout the country the regional
differences, even within short distances, are significant and should be addressed as a matter
o f priority.

Social welfare and health. NGOs in the social welfare sector were concerned about the lack
o f financing opportunities to help vulnerable groups and insufficient support from authorities
for NGOs to provide social services. In addition, they also felt that not enough was being
done to support deinstitutionalization. Instead o f supporting activities which promote
inclusion and deinstitutionalization, they felt more effort was being exerted to renovate and
build new institutions, contrary to the principle o f deinstitutionalization and providing
opportunities for disabled citizens to integrate into society. In terms o f health, participants
expressed their overall dissatisfaction with the state o f the health system, the quality o f
services and infrastructure.
Investment climate. In all regions, participants were concerned about the need to facilitate
doing business, starting from continuation o f the regulatory guillotine project, reducing
administrative barriers and making processes more transparent and simple. The need for
micro-financing opportunities were also expressed, since many small start-ups were not
eligible for existing financing arrangements (commercial bank loans, EU funds, state support
for SMEs etc.) In more developed regions, participants felt that they were doing quite well
and did not have serious issues with the business climate. However, they did lack financing
for further investments and innovations to move away from traditional industries (leather and
textiles) to innovative ones. In the less developed areas o f Croatia, participants wanted to see
more support for empowering women and youth so they can become involved in business
and entrepreneurship, For all these issues to be addressed successfully, participants indicated
that judiciary reforms need to proceed at a much faster pace and in a transparent manner.
Environment. While all agreed that environment, nature protection, renewable energy
resources and energy issues were important, the socio-economic issues discussed during the
consultations were considered to be o f immediate concern and more instrumental to
improving the quality o f life. However, the need to focus on sustainable development and
risk management, in view o f global developments (food crisis and climate change) should not
be disregarded, as these issues are o f high significance for the future o f Croatia.
0

European Integration. European accession i s viewed by most participants in a positive light
and as an important goal for Croatia. However, concerns were expressed with the low
capacity for absorption o f EU funds and the need to strengthen the capacity o f all
stakeholders, including NGOs, to apply for available EU funding.

Annex 5. Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report
for FYOS-FYOS
May, 2008
Country: Croatia Date of CAS: December 21,2004 Date ofprogress Report: M a y 30,2007
Period covered by the CAS Completion Report: December 2004 - M a y 2008

1. Introduction
1.
The Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) evaluates the
effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance to the Republic o f Croatia for meeting the
development objectives set in the FYOS-OS Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In October
2005, the launch of EU accession negotiations marked a critical milestone in Croatia’s
development path, bringing with it significant political and economic implications. This led the
Bank to reassess the CAS and tailor i t s assistance program to focus on Croatia’s accelerated EU
accession efforts, as reflected in the CAS Progress Report presented to the Board in M a y 2007.
2.
This CASCR comes at the heels o f Croatia’s parliamentary elections at end-2007. I t
examines the impact o f the CAS program at the end of a political cycle and draws lessons
o f experience for the new Country Partnership Strategy. Country-level indicators and
selected intermediate indicators measuring progress towards Croatia’s long-term goals are
provided in Table 1. Progress towards attaining the CAS objectives i s summarized in Annex 1.

2. Croatia’s Strategic Goals

3.
Croatia’s overarching strategic objective i s to integrate with the EU as a dynamic
and competitive economy and to achieve rapid convergence with EU living standards. A
successful EU accession will require reforms that will lead to improved macroeconomic
sustainability and sustained growth prior to accession. This strategic objective has remained at
the heart o f the government’s national agenda during the last political cycle.

4.
The strategic goals are clearly formulated in the Program o f the Government o f the
Republic o f Croatia for the 2003-2007 Mandate, as well as in the 2006-2013 Strategic
Development Framework (SDF) adopted in August 2006. They include increasing average
GDP growth rate to six percent by 2013 and achieving up to 75 percent o f the EU25 average
GDP per capita at PPP. The government plans to achieve these goals by:
(i) Completing the transition, which includes redefining the role o f the state,
completing the privatization and restructuring processes, and improving the investment
climate;
(ii) Developing infrastructure, including ICT; improving education outcomes and
R&D linkages to the business sector; increasing flexibility o f labor markets; and
strengthening social cohesion; and

(iii) Sustaining and promoting macroeconomic stability, environment and regional
development, and integrated financial services.
5.
The country development goals (or country-level outcomes) identified by the
Government o f Croatia underpin the strategic framework o f the CAS. The CAS was

46

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

designed to lay the foundation for Croatia's successful accession to the EU. When Croatia
became an EU candidate, the Bank recognized the need to evolve from i t s traditional focus on
post-war reconstruction and addressing the legacy o f transition. The EC's April 2004 Opinion on
Croatia's application for EU membership indicated the same priorities as set out in the
government program, and reinforced the course o f the Bank program. T o support the
government's growth and reform strategy for successful EU accession, integration, and
convergence, the CAS was centered on four key pillars: (i)macroeconomic stability; (ii)
sustainable private sector-led growth; (iii)broad participation in growth; and (iv) sustainable
natural resource management.
Since the CAS discussion at the Board in December 2004, Croatia launched the EU
accession negotiations in October 2005 and concluded the first 'screening' phase a year
later. As a result, issues flagged in the 2006 EU Progress Report influenced the CAS Progress
Report and led to adjustments in the Bank's priorities and program during the second half o f the
CAS period. Bank support was directed towards accelerating judicial reform, modernization o f
tax administration as well as costly environmental adjustments - all o f which Croatia had to
undertake prior to accession. Table 1 summarizes the status o f key country-level indicators and
the progress and achievements o f selected intermediate indicators for monitoring the progress
towards achieving the CAS goals.

3. Progress and CAS Outcomes

7.
Croatia has made substantial progress in achieving its long-term goals during the
CAS period. The CAS was designed at a time when Croatia embraced successful accession to
the EU as its main strategic objective, with a vision to achieving higher living standards through
accelerated EU convergence. Croatia’s macroeconomic stability has improved in recent years,
though the vulnerabilities remain, and solid progress has been achieved in private sector-led
growth. Gains in social development, however, are less evident. Progress in managing natural
resources in Croatia i s noteworthy, though this area continues to require significant investments.
The following sections review Croatia’s progress along each o f the four CAS pillars and analyze
the Bank’s contribution to the outcomes.

3.1. Macroeconomic Stability
3.1.1. Country-Level Indicators

8.
A successful economic transformation after independence and the start o f EU
accession negotiations have helped boost economic activity in recent years, with average
GDP growth reaching 4.8 percent during the CAS period. Inflation remained modest despite
increased oil and commodity prices, helped by the central bank’s efforts to maintain exchange
rate stability. Consumer price inflation increased slightly from 2.1 percent in 2004 to 2.9 percent
in 2007 due to higher prices for oil, food, housing, and utilities. Nonetheless, the average
inflation over the CAS period was 2.9 percent. The adverse terms o f trade shock, however,
contributed to a widening current account deficit, even though fiscal policy has tightened since
2003. The current account deficit increased from 6.6 percent in 2005 to 7.5 percent o f GDP in
2006, and continued to grow to 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2007, despite strong growth in exports of
goods and services. Overall however, net capital inflows have consistently exceeded the current
account deficit, boosting foreign exchange reserves.

9.
The PAL series helped the government implement a medium-term reform program
to achieve growth and move closer to EU accession. The PAL reforms made significant
contributions to fiscal consolidation efforts and to an enhanced business climate. The objective
o f the P A L was to strengthen the public sectors’ capacity and efficiency, as well as to create
conditions for private sector growth. Efforts to reduce government expenditure from more than
50.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 were on track until mid-2007. Government spending fell by over 2
percentage points o f GDP by 2006. However, in 2007 expenditures grew moderately to 48.6
percent o f GDP. Robust growth performance, however, eased the primary fiscal deficit from 3.7
percent o f GDP in 2003 to 0.2 percent by the end o f 2007. Deficit-reduction as well as
privatization receipts from Telecom and INA o i l company helped lower public and publicly
guaranteed debt from 54 percent o f GDP in 2003 down to 47.5 percent o f GDP in 2007.
3.1.2. Status of key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones

10.
Sustainable levels o f public spending. Since early 2004, Croatia placed greater
emphasis on fiscal consolidation primarily through better expenditure control and improvements
in tax collection and tax administration. Results were visible by the end o f 2004 when the

49

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

general government deficit declined from 6.3 percent to 4.9 percent o f GDP35. The deficit fell
even further by 2007 to 2.3 percent o f GDP. However, spending cuts were falling behind deficitreduction efforts. The size o f the state remains high by international standards; at above 48
percent o f GDP in 2008, i t i s some 10 percentage points higher than government expenditures o f
new EU member states. The reform program supported b y the PAL series envisaged a reduction
in total public spending to 45 percent o f GDP b y 2008, but Croatia will fall short o f this target as
a result of a surge in pre-election spending in 2007. A draft Public Finance Review was
completed in early 2007, with recommendations on cutting buoyant expenditures, improving
efficiency and effectiveness, and fiscal consolidation towards a balanced budget position.
Finally, through a Bank-supported Pension System Investment Project, the system to channel
second pension pillar contributions into the selected pension funds has been established (99.6
percent o f contributions reaches individual accounts within 48 hours). Moreover, the collection
o f social insurance contribution has been improved, thus reducing the burden o f the second pillar
transition costs by more than one-half.
11.
Fiscally sustainable public wage bill. Spending cuts were achieved by end-2006
through reductions in public administration wage bill, subsidies, as well as public investment in
highways in particular. Public administration and public expenditure management have been
strengthened in the past couple o f years. The PAL has emphasized measures that reduce the size
and promote the effectiveness o f public administration, and enhance the efficiency o f public
expenditure management. The public sector wage bill was reduced from 11 percent o f GDP in
2003 to 9.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. While the public sector wage bill declined since the launch
o f the P A L series, it remains high by international standards, and would need to be further
pruned in the quest to reduce the size o f the state.
12.
Subsidy reduction. The government supported nonviable state-owned enterprises
through generous subsidies, transfers, and guarantees. To bring enterprise subsidies down to EU
levels, the Croatian authorities implemented the Enterprise Sector Medium-Term Subsidy
Reduction Plan, gradually but steadily reducing subsidies since the P A L launch. Under PAL1,
the Croatian authorities prepared an inventory o f direct and indirect subsidies, and aligned their
methodology with the EU state aid guidelines using Technical Assistance Loan I1 proceeds. As
part o f the subsidy reduction plan, the government set an overall annual ceiling to total subsidies,
lowering it from one year to the next. Restructuring o f Croatian Railways (HZ) - also supported
under the PAL program - led to a decline in subsidies by 0.6 percent o f GDP over the CAS
period. However, one-off debt-equity swaps for the steel industry prior to privatization as well
as rescue aid for shipyards put an upward pressure on the subsidies level. The largest recipients
remained large loss-makers like shipyards, for which a restructuring program i s awaiting the
European Commission’s approval. Overall, enterprise subsidies were reduced from 3.4 percent
o f GDP in 2003 to 3.1 percent o f GDP in 2004, 2.8 percent in 2005 and 2.3 percent in 2006, as
well as in 2007 (preliminary), which i s close to the PAL target o f 2.2 percent o f GDP.
Road sector spending. Croatia’s past heavy investment in motorways has come at the
13.
expense o f maintaining the non-motorway network and resulted in considerable financial
obligations to service the debt needed to finance this investment, The government’s road sector
spending for the 2005-2008 period amounted to 2.8 percent o f GDP per annum, with a relative
decline in new construction spending and an increased share for road maintenance. This

35

50

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

represented major savings and efficiency gains, given the pre-2005 investment spending levels
which exceeded 4 percent o f GDP. B y 2008, the construction o f new roads i s targeted to decline
towards 1.5 percent of GDP, while maintenance w i l l remain stable at approximately 1 percent o f
GDP per year. These efforts have been carried out in line with the Program for Construction and
Maintenance of Public Roads 2005-2008, agreed with the Bank, and adopted by the government,
as part o f the CAS high case triggers.

14.
Health spending. The Croatian health system has performed relatively well compared to
neighboring countries in terms o f health achievements; however, these results have come at a
high cost and the public health insurance fund faces growing deficits, posing considerable fiscal
risks. The Croatian Health Financing Study, which was completed in June 2003, analyzed the
financing o f the sector and made recommendations for reform. The initial plans supported by the
PAL program were considered overly ambitious and the government undertook a more limited
approach to system reform by slightly reducing the basic package (for some brand named-drugs),
limiting co-payment exemptions by strengthening income-testing mechanism as well introducing
an administrative flat fee to limit excess demand. Public spending on health has declined since
the launch o f the PAL program from 6.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to an estimated 6 percent o f
GDP in 2007. However, arrears created by hospitals remained sizeable at 0.7 percent o f GDP and
points to the need for further reform efforts to make the system financially sustainable.
15.
Social benefits spending. Total spending on social benefits declined since 2003, albeit
moderately. In early 2004, a number o f enhanced categorical benefit packages were
reintroduced, including child, maternity, and war veteran benefits, along with tax exemptions. As
a result, total social benefit spending rose to 3.84 percent o f GDP in 2004, and spending on less
well-targeted benefits increased. At estimated 3.75 percent o f GDP in 2007, total spending
remains high compared to the EU average o f 2.5 percent o f GDP. Under PAL2, the government
adopted a social benefit spending reform strategy, which aims to consolidate more than one
hundred existing social benefit programs, strengthen their administration, and increase the share
o f funds allocated to means-tested benefits to reduce poverty. The strategy takes into account
several o f the recommendations provided to the government through the Living Standard
Assessment done in 2006. The share o f targeted programs remained low however, declining
from 9.3 percent o f total in 2004 to 8.0 percent in 2007, due to increased funding for categorical
benefits. However, a recent decision to increase the support allowance (a means-tested poverty
benefit) from HRK 400 to HRK 500 i s a step in the right direction and w i l l increase the relative
share o f means-tested benefits.
16.
Debt management. External imbalances remain large despite fiscal tightening in 20042006 and efforts by monetary authorities to curb foreign borrowing by domestic banks. The
renewed increase in the current account deficit in 2006 and 2007 and the rising in external debt
reflect private sector imbalances, with savings among companies and households lagging
investment outlays. External debt more than doubled since 1997, and remains a source o f
potential vulnerability. External debt (in EUR terms) rose from 85.5 percent in 2006 to 87.7
percent o f GDP by the end o f 2007. The government’s external debt declined from 25.3 percent
in 2004 to 17.7 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2007, while the external debt o f domestic banks and
other sectors (mostly enterprises) increased to 46.3 percent o f GDP in 2007. As a result o f
monetary policy restrictions, the external debt o f banks dropped to 23.6 percent o f GDP. The
government’s share declined in the last two years due to a shift o f deficit financing from foreign
to domestic markets in order to reduce foreign currency exposure. This was achieved as a part o f

51

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

the medium-term debt management strategy adopted in 2006, informed by the joint World
BanMIMF Program on Sovereign Debt Management and Debt Markets Development.

3.2. Sustained private sector-led growth
3.2.1. Country-Level Indicators

17.
Croatia has enjoyed solid economic growth since 2004, which averaged 4.8 percent
during 2004-2007 with inflation in the low single digits (below 3 percent). These numbers
compare well both with the ten new EU member states (EU1036), as well as the EU15, and
allowed for faster Croatian convergence. Labor productivity, which averaged 5.1 percent during
CAS period, and high capital inflow with foreign direct investments (FDI) at above 5.7 percent
of GDP per year, supported overall growth. A large part o f FDI, however, came from the
privatization o f state-owned companies (SOEs) and recapitalization o f the banking sector. Higher
inflows o f greenfield investment are s t i l l constrained by sizeable administrative barriers, in
particular at the lower levels o f government. The presence o f the state in the economy has been
reduced, though it i s s t i l l significant and would need further downsizing. Consequently, although
Croatia’s private sector share o f GDP has risen from 60 to 70 percent between 2003 and 2007, it
i s s t i l l much lower than that o f the EU10. S t i l l weak functioning o f the judiciary, high
administrative burden on businesses, unfinished privatization and soft budget constraints on
enterprises have limited enterprise restructuring and new business creation, which has
constrained growth.
3.2.2. Status o f key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones

18.
Privatization. The progress achieved by Croatia towards privatization o f SOEs has been
supported by the PAL series. B y end-2007, around 860 companies were sold or liquidated,
including the privatization o f almost all agri-combinats, as well as the loss-making steel mills
(Sisak and Split) and aluminum industry ( T L M Sibenik). The privatization o f tourism companies
and shipyards i s s t i l l pending. This will need to be addressed in the near future, given the
investment needs for technological and physical modernization and the more rigid state aid rules,
required by the legislation harmonized with the acquis. The Bank supported the government’s
analytical needs through the Benchmarking Study for five state-owned shipyards against top
world competitors as well as Social Impact Assessment for two shipyards undergoing
restructuring. There was also some progress towards the divestiture o f subsidiaries o f Croatian
railways (HZ), with two out o f sixteen companies privatized in 2007, one filing bankruptcy in
January 2008 and six more prepared for privatization by June 2008. The privatization process
has been informed by the Restructuring Strategy developed by McKinsey and financed through
the Bank PPIAF.
19.
Investment climate and business environment. In mid-2007, the government launched
the regulatory guillotine to abolish outdated legislation posing barriers to business. Among other
things, the government established one-stop shops to simplify business startup. At the same
time, the new Law on Physical Planning and Construction was enacted in the Parliament, aimed
at reducing the number o f construction-related permits and duration for their approval, as it has
36

been agreed under the PAL program. Croatia has also made important achievements in reducing
the time to register property, from 3-4 years to less than 6 months. This was supported by the
R e a l Property Registration and Cadastre Project. This reduction has contributed to much
improved access to credit. These improvements have placed Croatia among the ten top
reformers, as reflected in the Doing Business 2008 Report.
Market-oriented R&D system. The government has made solid progress to increase i t s
20.
R&D, and science and technology generation capacity. Steady progress was observed in recent
years, and a major milestone was acheived by the adoption o f the first integrated Science and
Technology (S&T) Policy 2006-2010 and Action Plan, completed in June 200737.The policy i s
closely linked with the National Strategy for Development o f S&T (2002) aimed at increasing
competitiveness o f the economy in view o f the EU integration process. The Policy sets out a
number o f objectives aimed at creating a more supportive legislative and regulatory framework
for S&T, increasing commercialization o f research and development (R&D) and facilitating
innovation. The government demonstrated i t s commitment to intensifying R&D in the industry
and stimulating demand for R&D services by establishing a high-level body, led by the Prime
Minister, to monitor implementation o f the Action Plan. The Bank i s supporting the
government's broad agenda through restructuring parts o f the research, development and
innovation infrastructure to better integrate them with the needs o f the economy (while
maintaining the excellence o f research). Strengthening linkages between the industry and the
research community i s o f particular importance. After initial difficulties, the Science and
Technology Pro'ect has been progressing well and became instrumental in supporting the
project agencies3' efforts to build a solid pipeline o f activities related to commercialization o f
intelectual property and knowledge, as well as technology transfer and technology infrastructure
development.
Judicial reform, Given the importance o f a sound and efficient legal system for
21.
promoting o f investment and growth, high priority i s attached to strengthening the judiciary.
Croatia has made some progress in moving towards rationalization o f the court system, but no
efficeincy gains have been achieved so far. The pilot mergers o f misdemeanor courts with
municipal courts, launched in 2006, did not achieve the desired results in terms o f efficiency. In
April 2007, a plan for the merger of courts was adopted, and the government submitted to the
Parliament the draft law that would downsize the court network from 107 courts to 65. With
respect to the court case backlog, the target that has been agreed under the PAL has been
exceeded, with the backlog reduced by 65% from April 2004 to June 2007 (from 1.64 to 0.59
million cases). Land registration cases alone formed about 50-60 percent o f the backlog, and this
reduction has been largely supported by the R e a l Property Registration and Cadastre Project.
B y supporting the amendments to the Land Registry Act, the project helped eliminate one o f the
key sources o f inefficiency and backlog, the non-adjudicative functions that judges were tasked
with - such as land registration and titling, maintenance o f the company registry, execution of
judgments, supervision o f elections, and other administrative tasks. These tasks have now been
almost completely transferred from judges to other bodies. Finally, the Integrated Case
Management System, which has been rolled out in several courts in Zagreb, Split and Pula in

2007, a tool that was set up through the Bank-funded Court and Bankruptcy Administration
Project, will further contribute to a more transparent court system and greater accountability o f
judges.
22.
Public administration. Croatia has made important progress in improving the efficiency
o f public administration, a prerequisite for effective policy implementation and public service
delivery, as well as one o f the key requirements for EU accession. In order to share the lessons
learned from the EU, a workshop was organized in 2005 to assist the government efforts to
reform public administration. The Technical Assistance Loan I1 and Sida Trust Fund for
Support to Public Administration Reform supported government efforts in designing salary
systems for civil, public and local government servants and implementing functional reviews o f
line ministries and state administrative agencies to inform rationalization plans. Two county
offices have undertakenrationalization based on the recommendations from the pilot review, and
a new internal organization o f the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare was rationalized. The
PAL program has further supported the government in these efforts by supporting the
introduction o f merit-based pay and promotion systems for civil service. A new Civil Service
L a w has been enacted, aiming at the depoliticization and professionalization o f the top level o f
state administration and, specifically, the reintegration o f Assistant Ministers and Ministerial
Secretaries into the civil service system, to ensure continuity in policy and management. A L a w
on Civil Service Salaries, an integral part o f the civil service reform measures, was expected to
be enacted by September 2007, but the process has been delayed in the pre-election period.
Finally, the policy process has been strengthened through the introduction o f mandatory fiscal
assessment, supported by the IDF grant for Strengthening Budget Management, regulatory
impact assessment, and social and environmental impacts o f policy and legislative proposals
(supported by EU and UNDP).
Transport and logistics. The modernization and restructuring o f the port o f Rijeka,
23.
supported by the Rijeka Gateway Project, improved the efficiency o f the port and increased i t s
competitiveness. Port traffic doubled from 2. 5 million tons in 2000 to 5.0 million tons in 2006.
Container traffic increased significantly from 12,700 containers (TEU) in 2001 to 94,400 TEU in
2006. Port development was better integrated with i t s surroundings, with the construction o f
international connection roads around Rijeka to provide shorter and quick routes for heavy traffic
to reach the port. Sharp growth in container traffic through the Rijeka port has been recorded (40
percent in 2007), as well as growth o f 36 percent o f transit through the Ploce port, thus bringing
both ports close to full capacity for specific type o f cargoes. These achievements have improved
their financial situation, exceeding targets for Rijeka port. Since the Trade and Transport
Integration Project, co-financed by EBRD, became effective in March 2007, the cooperation o f
railway companies along corridor V c increased. In this segment, the project i s building partly on
the efforts o f the Bank-funded Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project, which
facilitated the process o f modernizing the Croatian Railways through significant physical
investments. Trade in the region and exports from Croatia increased in the past years, also as a
result o f major customs modernization and reduced delays at border crossing (on average by 65
percent between 2000 and 2005), as well as reduced cost o f good transportation, which was
supported by the Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project.

24.

Productivity growth. The Bank has engaged with relevent government agencies in
assessing the current factors and obstacles for faster productivity growth in Croatia given i t s
convergence efforts to EU, through the preparation o f the EU Convergence Report: Assuring

54

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

Faster and Sustainable Economic Convergence. The study explores ways to ensure
sustainability of long-term growth through increased "flexicurity" and the generation o f highervalue added through a knowledge-based economy. It will also help identify alternative sets o f
reform packages, designed to ensure faster and sustainable economic convergence with the EU.
As a part o f this analytical work, the Bank conducted a Product Market Regulation study,
whereby Croatia's normative regulation i s being benchmarked against the OECD countries, as
well as an Investment Climate Assessment that looks at how businesses perceive obstacles for
further productivity growth.

25.
IFC in Croatia. During the CAS period, IFC focused i t s efforts on supporting postprivatization restructuring in key sectors with a priority in tourism, agribusiness/food processing,
support to SMEs, and facilitating retail infrastructure development. With the objective o f helping
domestic companies become competitive regionally through improved corporate governance,
environmental standards, and best practices, IFC has made substantial investments o f US$104
million in agribusiness and tourism sectors. IFC supported a pioneering company in tourism
industry, through a corporate loan, as well as an equity investment, to help it implement financial
restructuring, aimed at strengthening i t s financial situation and supporting i t s expansion in the
region. As part o f i t s support to the SME sector, IFC provided a loan to one o f the leading
commercial banks in the country to expand lending activities, among others, in small and
medium-sized enterprises. In the corporate sector, IFC has supported a large German discount
retailer to facilitate the FDI in Croatia. The Croatian government requested IFC's assistance in
improving the quality o f regulations affecting the start up and operation o f businesses. In 2006,
the government initiated the Regulatory Guillotine exercise which was designed and
implemented with support from IFC's FIAS, jointly with USAID. After completion o f the first
phase, the government issued a decision to accept the recommendations including the
elimination or simplification o f 55% o f all inventoried business regulations. Based on
preliminary estimates, these reforms w i l l save businesses some US$ 250 million in compliance
costs.

The
and improvements in tertiary education coverage and to some extent in effi~iency.~'
share o f adult population with secondary education increased from below 60 percent in 2003 to
63 percent in the third quarter o f 2007. This i s a result o f efficiency and quality improvements in
the Croatian pre-tertiary education system. Enrollment rates have improved at all levels,
particularly in pre-school and secondary education4', and completion rates remained high42.
Croatian tertiary education s t i l l faces significant efficiency issues due to high dropouts; however

Due to more accurate data, the baseline and the expected outcomes for adult population with secondary education have been
reset.
At the moment there are data limitations to assess change in tertiary education drop out rates as a measure o f institutional
efficiency. However, available data show increase in enrollment rates and the number o f higher education graduates during
the CAS period.
Preschool net enrollment rate went up from 43 percent in 2003 to 54 percent in 2007 and secondary net enrollment rate rose
to 80.6 in 2007.
Primary completion rate at above 99 percent, while the secondary completion rate reached 91.3 percent in 2007.

55

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

the system has managed to attract a higher number o f entrants, so the number o f graduates during
the CAS period increased. Tertiary education gross enrollment rate increased from 43 percent in
2003 to 53 percent in 2007, while the system produced 24 percent more graduates in 2007 than
in 2003. Croatia was, for the first time, able to benchmark achievement o f i t s students with the
European and OECD countries as it joined the 2006 PISA assessment, which focused primary on
science. Croatian students performed relatively well vis-a-vis other European countries,
particularly in science, while the results in mathematics and reading were relatively lower.
Croatia also managed to increase the share o f employed persons in the working-age population
during the CAS period (from 43 percent in 2003 to over 45 percent in the third quarter o f 2007).
It has been a good performer in health outcomes, with many outcomes at or above the average
for new EU member states. Important achievements in the health sector include the reduction in
infant mortality (from 6.3 in 2003 to 5.2 in 2006 per 1,000 live births) and in incidence o f TB
from 34 cases in 2003 to 25 in 2006). However, maternal mortality increased from 7.6 in 2003 to
9.7 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2006 (four deaths at birth in 2006, as compared to three
deaths in 2003 and 2005), which i s significantly above the EU-27 average o f 6.5.

3.3.2. Status of key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones
27.
Strengthening system management.
Since 2004, Croatia embarked upon many
important education reforms articulated in the government’s Education Sector Development Plan
2005-2010 and supported by the Education Sector Development Project. New National
Educational Standards stipulating new learning outcomes and student-centered teaching methods
and influencing curriculum reform in primary education, have been fully rolled out.
Furthermore, an External Assessment Center has been established and external assessments were
successfully introduced at different levels o f pre-tertiary education, preparing students for the
secondary school-leaving “matura” exam for the end o f the 2008-2009 school year. Even though
the government did not achieve i t s original goal o f extending compulsory education to the
secondary education level by 2007, a set o f incentives for pupils to enter and complete secondary
education have been implemented (such as free textbooks, transportation and accommodation).
The government aims to legislate the extension o f compulsory education during i t s new term.
Early progress has been achieved in modernizing the system o f continuous professional
development (CPD) for teachers and school principals (work on a strategy for the CPD o f
teachers has kicked off; a new model for training principals has been developed and an initial
group o f principals i s being trained in cooperation with the Dutch government). However, this
part o f the system i s s t i l l widely seen as inadequately reformed.
Increased student performance. The Education Sector Development Project annually
28.
monitors progress in the implementation o f the Education Sector Development Plan through a set
o f indicators, most o f which have been recording an upward trend. Secondary education
completion rate increased from 78 percent in 2003 to 91.3 percent in 2005. Croatia’s 15-yearolds, for the first time, benchmarked their knowledge with their peers in EU and OECD
countries as part o f PISA 2006. Croatian students performed relatively well in science (the
primary focus in this PISA round), with their scores falling in line with the average results for
EU countries. In reading and mathematics, they performed slightly below EU and OECD
students. So far, Croatia has managed to reduce the share o f VET students in the total secondary

56

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

enrollment43 (from 71.0 percent in 2004/05 to 69.6 percent in 2007/08), but at a slightly slower
pace than targeted. The latest reduction in the VET enrollments vis-a-vis gymnasium enrollments
indicates, however, that if the education authorities continue this progress, they could come close
to the 65 percent target by 2010. The expected CAS outcome o f decreasing the proportion o f
pupils in multi-shift schools from 90 percent to 50 percent was not reached. Given the huge
fiscal cost required to reach this target, it was an over optimistic goal. Still, Croatia did make
progress in eliminating three-shift schools, as it launched a major investment program, co-funded
by the Education Sector Development Project, to eliminate all three-shift schools and increase
the number o f single-shift schools by 20 10.

29.
Improved quality o f and access to health care services. Croatia has achieved many
health outcomes, at or above the average o f new EU member states. Croatia has one o f the
lowest standardized death rates among the new EU member states associated with cervical
cancer (3.5 per 100,000 population, lower than EU-27 average o f 3.6), or alcohol and smoking
related causes. L i f e expectancy increased from 75 in 2003 to 76 in 2006, surpassed only by the
Czech Republic and Slovenia among the new EU member states. Infant mortality decreased
from 6.3 in 2003 to 5.2 in 2006 per 1000 live births, similar to the levels in the new EU member
states but slightly higher than in EUl 544.However, the current health outcomes were achieved at
a relatively high cost: health expenditures increased from 8.2 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 8.4
percent o f GDP in 2006). The share o f primary health care expenditure in total health spending
has increased only moderately during the CAS period from 16.0 percent in 2003 to 16.1 percent
in 2006, and it will not reach the 20 percent target in 2008. Finally, an increasing awareness o f
the importance o f preventive health behavior and impact o f lifestyle on health has been observed
in the recent years, which was supported by public campaigns prepared under Health System
Project.

30.
Sustained increase in labor force participation and reduction in poverty rates.
Croatia has a very l o w employment-to-population ratio, in spite o f a minor increase that occurred
during the CAS period (from 43% in 2003 to 44% in 2007). Although the unemployment rate
has declined rapidly (from 14.3% in 2003 to 8.4% in Q3 2007), the employment-to-population
ratio has remained l o w because o f a further decline in the labor force participation rate to below
49 percent. The Bank’s Living Standards Assessment conducted in 2006 showed that absolute
poverty remained literally unchanged during the CAS period at 11.1 percent4’. Croatia’s
inequality i s only slightly higher than the EU15 average and the social benefit spending are some
two percentage points o f GDP higher than the EU15. The targeting efficiency o f the social
benefit program i s high, but the program remains relatively underfunded. Relative poverty46,on
the other hand, has mildly decreased during the CAS period to 16.3 percent. The two most
important contributors to this reduction were the growth in real wages and an increase in
maternity and child benefits. During the design o f the CAS, it was expected that poverty rates
would be reduced by improved targeting through means-testing for an increased share o f social
benefits, but this did not materialize. In 2007, as part o f the PAL program, the government
The expected outcomes for the share o f vocational schools/gymnasiums in the total secondary school enrollment have been
reset in order to reflect the ratio targeted in the Education Sector Development Plan 2005 - 2010 (69131 in 2007 and 65/35
in 2010)
Maternal mortality rate decreased from 7.6 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2003 to 7.1 in 2005 (EU-27 i s at 6.52 in 2005),
however the rate for 2006 i s 9.7, due to four deaths in 2006, as compared to three deaths at birth in 2003 and 2005 (Croatia
had only 41,446 live births in 2006).
The absolute poverty rate and income distribution has not changed since the late 1990s.
Defined as the percentage o f persons whose net income i s less than 60 percent o f the median net income o f all households.

developed a strategy and action plan for reform o f social benefit spending and increasing the
share o f benefits going to the most disadvantaged; the strategy implementation has been
somewhat delayed due to a slower pace o f reforms in the pre-election period, with major
decisions on increased poverty benefits, consolidation o f programs and administrative
simplification taking place at the beginning o f 2008. The Bank also provided assistance to the
sector through the Social Welfare Development Project, which supported improvements in
system management and training for social workers to build a better functioning system for those
most in need.

3 1.
Overcoming regional disparities. Croatia’s poor are predominantly less-educated and
elderly, and poverty tends to be concentrated in the rural Central and Eastern parts o f the
country. Structural unemployment, inadequate skills and activation policies as well as poor
targeting o f the social safety net are the main causes o f income poverty. In 2006, the Bank
conducted a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for the proposed restructuring o f the Brodotrogir
and Kraljevica shipyards to address labor dislocation anticipated in the initially planned
divestitures. Mitigation measures proposed in the SIA were discussed with the shipyards’
management, trade unions and the government, and have informed the restructuring plans
submitted to the EC for approval, which i s s t i l l pending.
32.
Strategy for regional development. In 2005, an integrated framework for the National
Strategy for Regional Development (NSRD) 2007-20 13 was approved by inter-ministerial
coordination group, which presented the groundwork to enable all parts o f the country to
contribute to sustainable national development and competitiveness, and to reduce social and
economic disparities across the country. A draft Act on Regional Development and a Regional
Development Strategy have been prepared, which s t i l l need to be further aligned with the EU
Cohesion policy for managing regional development in Croatia, both at the NUTS 2 and NUTS 3
level. The revision o f the Law and the Strategy i s closely connected with the negotiations o f
Chapter 22 (Regional policy and coordination o f structural instruments). The L i v i n g Standards
Assessment and Regional Development Study provided inputs to the strategy formulation
process by providing data and analysis on regional disparities at the county-level, and compiling
a variety o f development indicators from diverse data sources. During the CAS period, Croatia
focused on developing capacity at the county-level to prepare for the absorption o f EU funds for
regional development, and has achieved considerable progress. B y the end o f 2007, all
counties47, with the exception o f the City o f Zagreb, elaborated their Regional Operational
Programs (ROPs), some o f which have been developed with the support o f the Social and
Economic Recovery Project. There are currently being assessed by the newly established
Ministry o f Regional Development, Forestry and Water Management.
33.
Reducing regional disparities through a more competitive agricultural sector.
Croatia has accelerated i t s efforts to develop agriculture to ensure a more equitable regional
development and increase the competitiveness o f the economy. One o f the preconditions for the
development o f this specific sector i s to carry out the demining o f war-affected areas. Six million
square meters o f land in war-affected areas were cleared with support o f Bank financed projects
(Reconstruction Project for Eastern Slavonia, B a r a n j a and Western Srijem and Social a n d
Economic Recovery Project), thus enabling rural communities in Eastern Slavonia and Baranja
to restart agricultural activities and other rural businesses. However, close to 997 square km s t i l l
47

need to be demined, out o f which 250 s q km are in areas relevant to safety, socio-economic
development and environment. Croatia i s currently in the process o f extending the completion
target o f demining to 2019, in line with the obligations under the Otawa Convention. With
respect to sector-specific efforts, Croatia has made significant progress in aligning i t s legislation
with the EU acquis in the agriculture sector. These efforts have been supported by the Bank’s
Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project, which helped Croatia set the SAPARD program and
related institutional arrangements, such as the Paying Agency. The project i s contributing to
building the capacity o f the Croatian Food Agency, as well as supporting the institutional setup
for food safety management and food risk assessment, which i s among the key EU requirements
in the sector. Initial steps were taken with respect to the completion o f the food safety
management database, which i s coordinated with the CARDS food safety project.

3.4. Sustainable natural resource management
3.4.1. Country-Level Indicators

34.
Croatia has achieved significant progress in aligning its legislation with the EU
acquis on environment. B y adopting the new Environment Act in late 2007, Croatia established
the basis for full compliance with the EU acquis on environment. Considerable progress, in
particular, has been made in the areas o f air, water, nature protection, chemicals and GMOs. Due
to s t i l l relatively weak administrative capacity, the European Commission identified a
benchmark for opening negotiations on environment, related to the strengthening o f
administrative capacities at the national, regional, and local levels. As anticipated, environment
i s among the most challenging EU chapters, along with agriculture, both in terms o f policy and
investments. Improvement o f water quality i s part o f this challenge, and Croatia has made
sustained progress in this field. While major investments in improving wastewater management
and water pollution control have been launched, substantial improvements are s t i l l needed in
coverage o f water service delivery. In this regard, the government adopted a Water Sector
Strategy for 2008-2023, in the second half o f 2007, defining the ob’ectives Croatia plans to
achieve in water supply, water coverage and wastewater treatment4/. At the same time, the
government continued i t s efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. In line with the Kyoto
protocol49, ratified in April 2007, Croatia has to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 5
percent in the first commitment period between 2008 and 2012 in relation to the base year. The
Ministry o f Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction (MEPPPC) also
prepared the draft National Strategy on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol with Action Plan,
identifying sector measures and goals up to 2012. Finally, Croatia adopted a secondary
legislation on renewable energy resources (RER) in July 2007, which established the minimum
share o f RER in the power generation mix and procedures for providing financial support to
developers o f RER.

48

49

The coverage and quality o f wastewater services i n Croatia are lower than in recent EU member countries. 44% o f the
population has adequate wastewater collection systems and only 25% o f the collected wastewater i s treated.
At November 2006 conference o f UNFCCC parties, additional 3500 Gg C 0 2 eq was granted to Croatia, thus setting the
baseline (1990) at 34620 Gg C 0 2 eq.

3.4.2. Status o f key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones

35.
Increased environmental management capacity. Many o f the key outcomes were
partially achieved without involvement o f the Bank. For example, the government strengthened
the legislative and regulatory framework by introducing horizontal legislation, which i s fully in
line with the EU acquis. The government also introduced a public-private partnership model in
the waste management system through the National Waste Management Plan for 2007 - 2015,
and training o f staff. The weak institutional capacity which stems from the fragmentation o f the
sector remains an important challenge, also recognized by the EU. The Bank, through the
Environment TA and BNPP Dutch Trust Funds, helped in training and capacity-building for
the IPPC Directive (“mock” peer review with EU) and in establishing a benchmarking
environmental enforcement indicators program through the ECENA network. The Karst
Ecosystem Conservation (KEC) Project financed a biodiversity database system, provided
equipment, and established monitoring protocols, as well as standardized management planning
for national parks and nature parks, which were subsequently adopted country-wide for all
protected areas. The Environment TA supported a workshop to raise awareness o f the needs in
the sector and help promote private sector involvement in waste management.
36.
Improved wastewater management and water supply. Constructing new wastewater
treatment facilities or upgrading existing ones (Zagreb, Senj, Koprivnica, Zadar, Vinkovci, Split)
represent an important step towards meeting EU environmental standards. Wastewater treatment
s t i l l remains low at 25 percent, and wastewater connection i s at about 40 percent, indicating that
Croatia needs to invest additional efforts in this sector. As a result o f the implementation o f three
Bank-financed projects in the water sector, there has been significant improvement in water
quality in the coastal and inland areas. Water samples in the Brac channel and the Kastela Bay
indicate significant reduction in the number o f total coliform bacteria, following the completion
o f the wastewater system for Split and Solin, under the Municipal Environmental
Infrastructure Project. Following completion o f the Vinkovci wastewater treatment plant
(Reconstruction Project for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem), water quality
o f river Bosut has significantly improved. As a result o f the completion o f the sewage system in
the tourist resort Opatija, coastal water in the area i s now o f bathing quality (the Coastal Cities
Pollution Control Project). Finally, investments financed by the Croatian Waters, as well as
those supported by the international financial institutions, led to an increased number o f
connections to public water supply and wastewater systems.
Progress toward meeting the international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to
37.
reduce greenhouse emission. The government developed a national strategy for implementation
o f obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and an action plan, identifying goals and measures for
achieving the targets set. The Bank has supported Croatia’s efforts in meeting the Kyoto Protocol
obligations through two projects: Energy Efficiency Project (EE) and Renewable Energy
Resources Project (RER). The GEF Energy Efficiency (EE) Project has facilitated the creation
o f an energy efficiency market in Croatia, mainly through HEP’s own energy services company
(ESCO) and i s supporting the engagement o f four local banks in the financing o f energy
efficiency services. An adequate institutional and legislative framework for RER was established
in July 2007 following Bank support to the Ministry o f Economy, Labor and Entrepreneurship.
The GEF Renewable Energy Resources Project effectively supports the government and
stakeholders in the development o f a RER market. The support has included: the establishment
o f a Registry o f RER Projects and Privileged Producers, removing bottlenecks in the procedures

60

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

o f obtaining permits, support to the distribution and transmission system operator, as well as the
development o f secondary RER legislation. Under the project, a Renewable Energy Advisory

Facility has been established, providing potential RER investors with legal, financial and
technical advice and a contingent loan facility co-finances feasibility studies and other
preparatory activities. The RER project also mitigated risk for investors in RER and it supports
the creation o f a pipeline o f sound RER projects ready to be implemented. During CAS
implementation, the Bank and the government developed additional project in support o f
country’s efforts to meet Kyoto Protocol requirements, District Heating Project”, which assists
with energy savings achieved through rehabilitation o f district heating network in Zagreb and
Osijek.

4. Bank performance during the CAS period
38.
Program overview. The CAS envisaged three-lending scenarios and a triggers
framework for moving from one case to another. Though i t was anticipated that Croatia would
move to the base case by the end o f FY05, this materialized only in September 2005 with the
delivery o f the PAL. Following the CAS mid-term review, the lending scenarios remained but
the triggers were streamlined in view o f Croatia’s performance and the launch o f the EU
accession negotiations. Overall, the expected outcomes o f the CAS did not change at the CAS
review, with only some modifications to the lending program (introduction o f the Revenue
Administration Modernization Project and the Judicial Reform Project). A solid portfolio was
built up over the CAS period, consisting o f 13 projects and one additional financing loan for a
total o f US$988 million. In the final phase o f the CAS, the slowdown o f reforms in the preelection period delayed the effectiveness o f PAL2. However, on balance, based on the
achievements o f intended CAS outcomes across the four CAS pillars, the overall CAS program
i s assessed as satisfactory.
Portfolio performance. The current portfolio o f disbursing operations amounts to
39.
US$1.07 billion5’, and it represents the largest portfolio since the Bank started i t s activities in
Croatia. With US$522 million approved in FY07, Croatia was the second largest E C A borrower,
with a major increase in net commitments (from US$592 to US$1,109 million). The number o f
new projects and the major increase in commitments, as well as loan closures, resulted in a
relatively young portfolio (average age o f 3.2 years during the CAS period), but also caused an
explainable drop in the disbursement ratio from 19 percent in FY05, through 17 percent in FY06,
to 16 percent in FY07 (above E C A average in FY05; below E C A average later).

40.
Portfolio performance has been uneven during the CAS period. Following major
problems in FY04 (37 percent o f commitments at risk), the Bank prepared project improvement
plans, which enabled five unsatisfactory projects to be upgraded during FY05. None o f the
projects in the portfolio closed with unsatisfactory rating, though several closed with moderately
satisfactory rating. In FY06, two new projects were in problem status, but corrective measures
agreed at the Joint Portfolio Review (JPR) led to resolving the bottlenecks. The government
acknowledged the JPR as a useful monitoring tool and introduced an annual review o f all IF1
portfolios as a statutory requirement. The JPRs identified three main issues: (i)effectiveness

delays (average o f 6.6 months); (ii)slow pace o f implementation reflected in relatively slow
disbursement; and (iii)increased number o f projects rated moderately satisfactory. A
combination o f factors contributed to this, including complexity o f project design, inadequate
project readiness, weak implementation capacity and lack o f familiarity with Bank procedures.
Remedial actions have been agreed at JPRs but implementation o f these remained uneven.

Country dialogue. The CAS was prepared in close cooperation with and received clear
ownership from the government. The Bank’s country office engaged in CAS consultations across
the country, with a broad range o f stakeholders; in addition to the authorities at the central and
the regionalAoca1 levels, consultations included civil society, parliamentarians, and small
business and trade union representatives. The rationale was the country’s launch o f accelerated
EU accession efforts, which required wider public support for the upcoming reforms. The Bank
also launched virtual public consultations on the CAS Progress Report, by posting the draft
report on the Bank’s website. Regular CAS stock taking with the government and stakeholders
helped guide the Bank’s assistance program over the CAS period. This enabled the Bank to
adjust i t s program and mobilize i t s resources in a timely manner for example by: (i)
providing
project preparation facility (PPF) for setting up the SAPARD Agency; (ii)
providing a PPF for
the Trade and Transport Integration Project; (iii)
expediting additional financing for the Rijeka
Gateway Project; and (iv) accelerating the preparation o f the Revenue Administration
Modernization Project. However, the Bank has not always succeeded avoiding the bunching o f
loans at the end o f the fiscal year, potentially compromising implementation readiness.
42.
As the core of the CAS program, the PAL served as a tool for continued country dialogue
on policy reforms beyond the authorities. In fact, the government has seen a clear role for the
Bank in engaging in a dialogue with social partners on the ongoing structural reforms preparing
for EU membership. Bank experts were often invited to share international experience in key
issues, such as public expenditure management, restructuring o f railways and shipyards, and
privatization. Several policy notes were prepared and workshops held to support public debate on

issues such as the social impact assessment o f shipyard restructuring or the EU experience on
employee stock ownership plan as input for the government’s strategic documents.

43.
Working with other development partners. The Bank has effectively worked with
development partners through: joint organization o f policy workshops, bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in select sectors and reform areas, and mutually sharing diagnostics and knowledge
to make the best use o f resources available. The Bank closely cooperated with the IMF that
supported the government’s economic policy program with a Stand-by Arrangement.
44.
With EU integration being the key driver o f the reform process, the Bank enhanced i t s
coordination with the E C Delegation to help Croatia implement EU requirements and support
institution-building to better absorb EU grants. Initially, a number o f successful Phare-funded
projects have proven to be the result o f EU and Bank coordinated assistance, while subsequent
the cooperation focused later on the absorption o f the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance
(IPA) funds and complementarities with IPA. The Bank and the EU have established a high
degree o f cooperation under several projects: (i)
Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project - funding
the preparation o f the SAPARD Program; (ii)
Real Property Registration and Cadastre Project administration o f three CARDS-funded projects (EUR11 .O mill); (iii)Inland Waters Project TA funding to build a project pipeline for EU funds (also planned under proposed Coastal Cities
Pollution Control 11); and (iv) GEF Agricultural Pollution Control Project - assisting the country
to comply with the EU Nitrates Directive. Moreover, the PAL-supported reforms were closely
coordinated with the EU, in particular in the areas o f public administration,
privatizatiodrestructuring, judiciary and railways. The main vision was to respect the country
priorities as the driving force o f the programs, and support government-led donor coordination.
Hence, all joint workshops (public administration reform, decentralization, judiciary and
fiduciary systems) were organized with the government’s co-chair role, while the agreements
between the Bank and the E C were shared with the Ministry o f Finance and the Central State
Office for Development Strategy and Coordination o f EU Funds (CODEF), to help CODEF’s
donor coordination role.
45.
The Bank coordinated i t s work in specific development areas with the UN agencies,
namely UNHCR and UNDP, with emphasis on supporting programs o f economic and social
revitalization o f the areas o f specials state concern. Cooperation with UNDP was also developed
in areas o f energy efficiency and social welfare. During the CAS period, EBRD has been a cofinancing partner under three projects, the Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project,
Municipal Environmental Infrastructure Project and the Trade and Transport Integration
Project. The Bank and EBRD also jointly prepared a Country Procurement Assessment
Report (CPAR). As for the role o f bilateral donors, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden (Sida Swedish International Development Agency), UK (DfiD and British Council) and U S (USAID)
were among the key partners in this CAS. Donor coordination led to joint financing efforts in the
areas o f public administration (DfID; Sida TA for Public Administration Reform), agriculture
and environment (Netherlands grants co-financing the Coastal Cities Pollution Control and
Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project), and social welfare assistance (Sida grant for Social
Welfare Development Project).
46.
Bank performance. In a challenging environment o f uneven reform implementation,
overall, Bank performance during the CAS period was satisfactory. First, the Bank’s CAS
consultation process was carried out in accordance with the recommendations o f the client
survey, conducted in 2003, recognizing that dissemination o f the rationale for the reform agenda

63

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

was particularly important for successful implementation. Second, the Bank aligned the CAS
with Croatia’s EU agenda, supporting the country’s accelerated accession efforts. This was done
by designing the program and projects to support the country’s obligations for EU harmonization
and by increased coordination with the EC. Third, the Bank made an impact on public debate
through knowledge sharing. Finally, and most importantly, implementation o f the CAS program
has improved development outcomes in several areas as described in the previous chapters.

5. Lessons Learned

47.

A number of important lessons relevant for the design o f the new CPS emerged
from the CAS Completion Report. First, a more flexible CAS structure would be
appropriate going forward. When the CAS was originally designed, Croatia had high and
progressively growing external debt, large fiscal deficit and a lapsed I M F program (new IMF
Stand-by Arrangement was signed in August 2004), and there was an expressed desire on the
part o f the government to have a strong World Bank program to support policy reform efforts.
The combination o f these factors led to a tightly-designed CAS with detailed triggers moving the
program from one scenario to the other.

48.
Many important reforms have been implemented under the PAL program as
described in this report. However, there has been hesitation o r even backtracking at times,
especially in the period leading to the parliamentary elections. This created uncertainty
about the fate and timing o f some investment projects that were included in the base and high
case scenarios. Given the many different counterparts working on those projects, who had
limited or no impact on the implementation o f the P A L program, these uncertainties have created
difficulties in managing relationships and planning ahead for both the Bank and the authorities.
Furthermore, Croatia has maintained strong macroeconomic performance and solid economic
growth for a prolonged period o f time, and the Bank’s contribution to Croatia’s external
financing needs was rather modest. Thus the lesson for the new CPS i s that Croatia will benefit
from continued intensive analytical and advisory work and a focused program o f investment
loans and other non-policy based instruments. These w i l l not depend on but w i l l be
complemented, as warranted, by single-tranche DPLs in areas where opportunities arise, and
where there i s strong political support and government commitment, and the coordination o f
cross cutting reforms i s ensured.

49.

Second, the PAL program was designed to support a broad and politically difficult
reform agenda. While some o f the planned actions represented first generation reforms (such as
the reduction o f subsidies, privatization o f companies in the competitive sector), taken together,
they comprised a politically and socially difficult package (from restructuring o f the railways
company to the reform o f social benefits and the privatization o f shipyards). The government
and the Bank both believed and continue to believe that these reforms are important priorities,
but full implementation has proven difficult. Going forward, Croatia’s reforms may be better
supported by DPLs that focus on a more narrowly defined agenda. Such DPLs would support an
overall medium-term reform program through a series o f single tranche loans with clearly
responsible and accountable government counterparts.

50.
Third, effectiveness delays and uneven implementation progress of projects was
reflected in relatively slow disbursements and require actions on both sides. On the Bank’s
side, ensuring implementation readiness o f projects, including the availability o f implementation

64

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY12

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report

capacity and the preparation o f procurement documents, remains crucial. As for the authorities,
reducing the processing time for project effectiveness, allocating necessary resources to create
implementation capacity and strengthening the Ministry o f Finance’s coordination role and
support function vis-a-vis the implementing agencies, could help improve project performance
and accelerate the flow o f funds.

Annex 4: IFC in Croatia

As o f December 2007, IFC's committed portfolio was US$300 million allocated in the financial
markets (40 percent), general manufacturing (41 percent), and agribusiness (1 9 percent). During
FY04-FY07 IFC has committed over US$250 million (US$15.5 million in equity) compared to
US$457 million during FY00-FY03. Also, IFC has mobilized US$25 million through syndicated
banks compared to US$34 million during FY00-FY03. In addition, IFC financed about US$SO
million in South East Europe (SEE) regional projects, including Croatia. The following i s an
analysis o f IFC progress against CAS Objectives.

owned insurance company. The project has been postponed
until the government decides to privatize it. IFC also contacted
another insurance company acquired by a strategic partner
which showed no appetite for an IFC equity investment.
Securitization: Although interested in developing securitization
projects, IFC couldn't succeed because a securitization law has
not yet been approved.

Energy effciency/renewable energy: IFC has been exploring
with different banks the possibility o f supporting such a

IFC has done significant business development work in all areas
o f infrastructure (ports, roads, airports, railways, power,
tugging, passenger shipping, trucking, logistics, and renewable
energy). However, IFC did not succeed in financing any
projects since most of the infrastructure remains under state
ownership. In a few cases such as wind mills, local
commercial banks offered very competitive financing to the
private sponsors and IFC didn’t have a role to play.
Recently, IFC has offered its advisory services to support the
government with PPP in infrastructure(ports and airports).
Should the government ask for support, IFC i s open to offer its
