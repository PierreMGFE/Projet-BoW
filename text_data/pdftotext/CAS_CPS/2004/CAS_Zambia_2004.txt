EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Country Context. Zambia’s economic development has been dominated by the secular decline
in the purchasing power o f i t s copper resources, which has been accompanied by a decline in per capita
income f r o m US$752 in 1965 to US$351 in 2002. During the 1990s, in an attempt to arrest and reverse
the economic decline, the Government implemented a sweeping program o f liberalization and
deregulation, eliminating most major market distortions. However, Govemment commitment to reform
weakened in the mid- to late-nineties when macroeconomic stabilization led to an initial contraction.
Since 1999, the economy i s experiencing a modest recovery with positive per.capita GDP increases o f 1.4
percent annually. Poverty reduction, however, remains a challenge due to a heavy debt burden, weak
institutional capacity, and ineffective spending. In 1998, an estimated 73 percent o f the population lived
below the official poverty line compared to 70 percent in the early nineties. The impact o f the H I V / A I D S
pandemic further undermines steps to reduce poverty and over the past decade the trend in the majority o f
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has moved in the wrong direction.
1.

The Government’s Program. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP, M a y 2002) and the
ii.
Transitional National Development Plan (TNDP) seek to achieve poverty reduction through promoting
economic growth and supporting infrastructure, improved governance, improved access and quality in
the provision o f social and public services, and mainstreaming o f crosscutting issues o f HIV/AIDS,
gender, and the environment. The Govemment i s committed to an anti-comption policy and sees
macroeconomic stability as a prerequisite for private sector-led, export-oriented growth. However, more
Govemment ownership and commitment are needed to break with thepast to reach the goals set forth in
the PRSP/TNDP .
The World Bank Group Strategy. The Bank Group’s assistance strategy - comprising o f
iii.
programs, policy dialogue, and partnerships - i s aligned with the Government’s PRSP/TNDP through
three strategic priority areas: (i)
a diverszjied and export-oriented economy, which creates an enabling
environment for facilitating private investment and development; (ii)
improved lives and protection ofthe
vulnerable, which will improve the quality o f l i f e o f citizens and facilitate the achievement o f MDGs,
through better service delivery; and (iii)
an eficiently and effectively managed public sector, to improve
governance, public sector management, and overall effectiveness o f public expenditure programs.
iv.
Lending Program. The results-based C A S explicitly takes into account the existing portfolio as
the major driver towards progress on PRSP/TNDP indicators and C A S outcomes over the next four years.
With regard to new lending, the C A S starts out in the l o w case o n account o f weak implementation
capacity and failure o f putting in place measures that would allow Zambia t o reach i t s HIPC completion
point. Selectivity o f new lending i s key for refocusing and streamlining the areas o f Bank intervention in
line with our comparative advantage and other donors’ support programs. The FY04-07 l o w case
provides for US$200 million in IDA resources, consisting o f 1-2 operations per year, largely t o safeguard
services to the poor and/or build on successful projects where implementation risks are acceptable. I t
proposes support for: new projects for infrastructure in FY04; t w o projects for economic diversification
and improved climate for private sector investment, and improved govemance, in FY05; water sector
reform program and the Government’s effort to jump-start agricultural led growth and income generation
through two projects in FY06; and, support to the education and health (including HIV/AJDS) sectors
through two projects in FY07.

The base case proposes a total FY04-07 lending program o f US$3 10 million. It assumes that:
v.
macroeconomic stability will be achieved after an agreement o n an IMF PRGF; and reaching the H I P C
completion point (expected by the end o f 2004); satisfactory implementation performance o f the existing
- 1-

portfolio; and, good progress in the areas PRSP implementation and o f economic governance. The base
case would include adjustment lending to support macroeconomic stabilization and growth. The base
case would also allow the Bank t o bring forward some operations. If the pace o f reform further
accelerates, especially regarding macroeconomic management, governance, and service delivery, a high
case scenario o f US$390 million for FY04-07 would include programmatic support.

Non-lending program. T h e Bank’s non-lending program will contribute to attainment o f PRSP
vi,
objectives, help address weaknesses o f the PRSP as identified in the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), and
underpin lending operations. AAA activities would provide the LICUS-type analytical support that
would be needed to help move the policy agenda ahead and support a transition to the base case. The
planned non-lending work program i s designed, inter alia, to: (i)
support the Government-driven PRSP
process with annual progress reports and the functioning o f a sound M&E system to gauge progress; (ii)
update the knowledge base through a Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment and Strategic Country
Gender Assessment; (iii)
support policy dialogue o n public finance/public sector management with annual
PEWPEMFAR reports that cover requirements o f CPAR and CFAA; and (iv) support the development o f
sound private sector and agricultural programs through strategic and analytical work that will underpin
future lending activities. In this regard, the findings and recommendation o f the F Y 0 4 Strategic Country
Gender Assessment will be incorporated in future policy dialogue and Bank programs.

Risks. Attainment o f C A S and PRSP objectives faces six main risks: (i)
the Government‘s
preoccupation with political issues which divert attention away from the poverty agenda; (ii)
macroeconomic instability, and the economy’s vulnerability on account o f continued delay o f an
agreement on a new PRGF; (iii)
economic and political developments in Zimbabwe and the possibility o f
peace collapsing in the DRC; (iv) continuing H N / A I D S pandemic affecting all spheres o f the economy;
(v) lack o f good governance; and (vi) complacency and reduced urgency to take decisive action because
o f currently above-normal copper prices. Bank interventions, with support from partnerships with other
donors, civil society and private sector, are designed to mitigate and limit exposure t o these risks.
vii.

viii.
CAS Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring o f the Bank’s effectiveness will take place both at
the project level and at the level o f the overall assistance program. The core C A S benchmarks are derived
from PRSP targets. These benchmarks: (i)
reflect the selective areas o f Bank involvement under the CAS;
(ii)
cover the key challenges that Zambia must address and that the Bank i s best placed to assist with; and
(iii)
are achievable within the C A S timeframe. The Bank will merge the CPPR with the results framework
and carry out annual program reviews with stakeholders in Zambia. At the mid-point o f the C A S period,
the Bank will review the indicators and targets to assess progress in implementing the assistance program,
and adjust the Bank’s strategy as necessary.
ix.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
Alignment: Does the proposed strategic focus o f the CAS adequately align with the
Government’s PRSPITNDP?
Triggers: I s the proposed approach o f basing the triggers on the Government’s ability to achieve
macroeconomic stability and policy reforms appropriate?
Diversification: Are the plans for the diversification o f Zambia’s economy away from copper
appropriate?
Voice and MDGs: Does the Bank support program adequately enhance “voice” in Zambia and
improve Zambia’s prospects o f achieving the MDGs?

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covers the four-year period from FY04 to FY07. The
CAS i s results-based, and Zambia i s one o f the pilot countries for this new approach. While the C A S
covers activities o f IDA, IFC’, and MIGA; it i s not ajoint CAS. I t reviews recent progress in Zambia’s
economic and social development and identifies the key development challenges Zambia faces in moving
forward. It applies lessons learned from the previous CAS and the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE)
and presents a strategic and results-based program o f lending and non-lending activities under different
risk and performance scenarios.
2.
The C A S represents the Bank’s strategic alignment with Zambia’s 2002 Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP), which was embedded and expanded in the current Government’s Transitional
National Development Plan (TNDP). The CAS i s based o n a broad consultative process, involving the
Government, civil society, and development partners. It i s fully aligned with the main pillars and
crosscutting issues encompassed in the PRSP. The CAS proposes a program o f assistance that will
support Zambia in prioritizing, sequencing, and implementing the PRSP/TNDP in areas highlighted in the
Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) that accompanied the PRSP. In addition, this C A S will support the
development o f annual PRSP progress reports and Zambia’s next PRSP, scheduled for FY06. A C A S
progress report (envisaged for FY06) will provide the opportunity to re-align the Bank’s assistance
strategy with Zambia’s new PRSP.

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT
3.
Context. Economic development has been dominated by the secular decline in the purchasing
power o f Zambia’s copper resources. The situation has been further aggravated by frequent occurrences
o f drought, the Government’s inability to effectively manage those episodes o f misfortune, failure to
diversify the economy away f r o m copper, and the H I V / A I D S pandemic. This has l e d t o a decline in per
capita income from an a l l time high o f US$752 in 1965 to US$35 1 in 2002 (see Figure 1).
Zambia i s among the most heavily indebted countries in Africa. The decline in copper prices2
4.
and the increase in o i l prices in the early seventies led to a considerable deterioration in Zambia’s terms o f
trade. The authorities believed that the worsening was a temporary phenomenon and would reverse, and
therefore undertook huge external borrowings to avoid having to restructure the economy. As a
consequence, Zambia became heavily indebted and interest payments o n foreign debt service were higher
than public spending o n human development during most o f the 1990s. At the end o f the last decade, i t
became clear that even with exceptional growth, Zambia’s external debt situation would remain
unsustainable and that i t s debt service payments would crowd out much needed pro-growth and poverty
reducing public expenditures. Zambia was granted debt relief under the enhanced H I P C framework when
the decision point was reached at the end o f 2000, with a floating completion point that i s expected to be
reached during 2004. Nonetheless, Zambia continues to depend heavily on donor grants and concessional
loans to finance many o f i t s expenditure programs and development projects. In 2002 alone, 39.5 percent
o f central government expenditures were financed through foreign grants and loans.

’ The IFC has categorized Zambia as a group 3 country (see paragraph 119).

5.
Attacking Poverty and Achieving the MDGs. Over the past decade, poverty in Zambia has been
o n the rise and the trend in MDGs points in the wrong direction. These adverse economic developments,
exacerbated by weak institutional capacity and ineffective spending, have clearly affected Zambia’s
ability to fight poverty and improve living conditions for i t s population. Zambia ranks 163 out o f 173
countries covered by the 2003 United Nations Human Development Report. In 1998, an estimated 73
percent o f the population lived below the official poverty line compared to 70 percent in the early ninties.
The poor lack not only income but also access to basic services such as education, health, safe water, and
infrastructure. The welfare state upon which they once relied to meet some o f their basic needs failed and
has largely disappeared. At the same time, the c i v i l service i s ineffective in providing the goods and
services normally expected o f a government-ducation,
health, and general administration.
The overall increase in income poverty was accompanied by a sharp deterioration in indicators o f
6.
human welfare-stunting rose by nearly 10 percentage points in the nineties, and, by the end o f the
decade, nearly h a l f o f all children aged five years or younger were st~nted.~
M o r e than 10 percent o f
children die before reaching their first birthday, and an additional 6 percent do not survive past five years
o f age. Moreover, under-five mortality actually rose in the 1990s. Adult illiteracy i s s t i l l widespread; 40
percent o f women (15 years and older) neither read nor write. The stock o f human capital has fallen
steadily; schooling levels among 40-45 year olds are higher than the 20-25 year old cohort. Primary
enrollments and completion rates fell during the initial period o f the 1990s, and have begun to improve
only in the past couple o f years. These trends must be reversed in order for Zambia to attain the
MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are presented in Table 1. The picture for Zambia
i s one o f retrogression rather than progress during the 1990s. In particular, the spread o f H I V / A I D S i s a
major challenge, not in the least because this will require a significant change in behavior (see Box 1). As
the last column o f Table 1 shows, if past policies and performance are continued, the prospects o f Zambia
reaching the MDGs are almost uniformly poor. Reaching the MDGs would require a significant and
sustained injection o f resources and an acceleration o f growth that i s more pro-poor than in the past.

Gender inequalities. In part, Zambia’s l o w economic growth and persisting poverty are also
7.
attributable to the existence of gender gaps between women and men, especially with regard to education,
health, decision making and access to and control over productive resources. Women predominate in the
agricultural sector and women do most o f the farm work. Therefore, sector policies and programs need to
recognize and act on gender-differentiated structural roles in agriculture explicitly. Gender inequalities
are exacerbated by the impact of the H I V i A I D S pandemic. Prevalence rates are much higher among
young females than males, but this pattern changes as males and females grow older with the prevalence
rates being higher for males. Several factors, largely arising from cultural norms, account for the
differential prevalence o f HIV infection among females and males in Zambia. Since women are
Stunted i s defined as height-for-age more than two standard deviations below the n o m for the reference age group

- 2-

caregivers and are also the ones more affected by the pandemic, the productive activities o f women are
l i k e l y t o be reduced accordingly. This slows d o w n agncultural production and adversely affects food
security, as more women than men are involved in the production o f food at the household level.

Economic Developments. During the 1990s, the Government introduced a number o f
8.
fundamental changes in economic policies (see Appendix 2.1). A sweeping program o f liberalization and
deregulation was implemented, eliminating most major market distortions. With a few exceptions, price
controls were abolished and the exchange rate and interest rates were liberalized. Trade reforms
simplified the tariff structure, removed quantitative restrictions, and transfonned the Zambian trade
regime into one o f the most open in the sub-region. The dominant role o f the Government in commercial
activities was substantially reduced. T o date, about 260 state-owned enterprises have been privatized.

The economy i s experiencing a modest recovery with positive increases in real incomes since
9.
1999 (see Figure l),
although the general perception in Zambia i s that the reforms have not brought the
increase in well being that was promised and expected. Per capita GDP increased by an average 1.4
percent annually since 1999. The two main sectors contributing to this positive development are services
and industry on the supply side, while export and investment are the main source o n the demand side o f
the economy. As a result o f strong recovery from the effects o f the 2002 drought, agriculture has
contributed significantly to real GDP growth for 2003, estimated at 4.2 percent for the year.
10.
One o f the main constraints holding back a stronger economic expansion i s the unbalanced
macroeconomic environment. Notwithstanding repeated attempts t o reduce the Government budget
deficit to a sustainable level and achieve l o w and stable inflation during the 1990s, macroeconomic
stabilization remains elusive with inflation running at 17 percent and an estimated central Government
budget deficit at over 5 percent o f GDP for 2003. With real interest rates at well over 10 percent, the
current policy mix can be characterized by monetary policy overcompensating for loose, unpredictable,
and not very effective fiscal policy. The l e v e l o f interest rates obviously hampers expansion o f
investment and affordable access to credit for working capital, putting the current recovery and
diversification away from copper injeopardy.

11.
The Government’s decision at the beginning o f 2003 to increase c i v i l service personal
emoluments by an additional 3 percent o f GDP seriously threatened Zambia’s fragile macroeconomic
stability. As a result, the Government could not reach a new PRGF arrangement with the IMF, thereby
delaying HIPC completion to at least the second h a l f o f 2004. This has made Zambia’s external position
more precarious as balance o f payments support i s delayed and cannot be used for budget financing. In
turn, this has led to an increase in domestic borrowing by the Government. With nominal interest rates
currently at around 30 percent, this i s clearly unsustainable and will quickly lead to a crowding out o f
growth enhancing and poverty reducing expenditures and increasing domestic interest payments,
amounting to 3 percent in 2003. In addition, the maximum interim assistance from the IMF under the
enhanced HIPC initiative was reached at the end o f 2003, significantly increasing debt service payments
for 2004 and risking a serious depletion o f foreign reserves. This can easily cause a reversal o f the
current growth momentum if additional balance o f payment support does not materialize.
Political and Governance Developments. Since the end o f one-party r u l e in 1991, Zambia has
12.
conducted three peaceful presidential and parliamentary elections. I t n o w has several vocal opposition
parties, which are represented in Parliament. I t has an assortment o f active non-governmental
organizations and civic society groups. The media i s dominated by the t w o state-owned dailies and the
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation, but there are independent newspapers and radio stations.
One o f the things that Zambians can be proud o f i s that they have, since independence in 1964, avoided
civil strife.

Zambia’s Government continues to struggle with accountability for public resources and inability
to effectively deliver services. The absence o f a credible budget, caused by a lack o f effective and
realistic budget preparation has follow-on implications for budget execution, procurement, and ultimately
for service delivery. Spending on primary education clearly illustrates this point as only between onesixth and one-third o f total funding available eventually reaches the schools in the f o r m o f cash.

The current administration, headed by President Mwanawasa, was voted into power in December
14.
200 1 and succeeded the previous Chiluba Government. The new Government has given mixed signals
concerning the direction o f economic policies (see Table 2). Although i t has made the fight against
corruption a priority. It has set up a Task Force on Corruption, which i s investigating suspected cases o f
what i s called the plunder o f national resources. The Task Force has issued orders confiscating assets o f a
number o f individuals closely associated with the previous Government. In addition, the Anti-Corruption
Commission, whose remit i s much wider than that o f the Task Force, continues i t s work. However, to
this end, the new era o f accountable and transparent government that multi-party democracy was
supposed to usher in has not yet materialized (see Figure 2). Zambia i s grappling with weak government
effectiveness and showing the results o f the fight against corruption.
In another popular move, the Government began to signal that it would not press ahead with the
15.
privatization o f the remaining parastatals as planned, but reduce their fiscal pressure and improve their
corporate governance structure by pursuing a strategy o f commercialization. Now, with the benefit o f
lessons o f experience (see B o x 2) and against the backdrop o f changes in the global economy, the
Government i s recalibrating i t s approach for several large state-owned utilities.

A number o f measures adopted by the Govemment have put it at loggerheads with the opposition
16.
parties, prominent sections o f c i v i l society, and the labor unions. The measures in question include the
appointment o f the Constitution Review Commission and the attempt to renegotiate the 2003 collective
agreement with the public service unions given that the initial increases in personal emoluments led to a
budget overrun that prohibited Zambia f r o m entering into a new IMF PRGF agreement in 2003.

111. ECONOMIC PROSPECTS
The prospects for rapid and sustained economic growth o f Zambia’s economy will depend in the
17.
short run o n the Government’s ability to successfully rebalance and regain control over i t s
macroeconomic policies, in particular fiscal policy, while the medium-term prospects critically depend on
the extent, mix, and pace of structural reforms. An important and critical first step would be agreement
with the IMF o n a new PRGF, which would pave the way towards H I P C completion. Without HIPC
completion, Zambia’s external position would become extremely fragile and could lead to an economic
implosion and accumulation o f external arrears.

The short-term outlook for 2004 i s constrained because prospects o f reaching H I P C completion i s
18,
not expected before the second half o f 2004. In the base case, the fiscal deficit i s expected to decrease
from an estimated 5.3 percent in 2003 to 4.0 percent in 2004. However, monetary policy i s not expected
to be accommodating as external budget financing will be less forthcoming in the f i r s t h a l f o f 2004, and
the Govemment will therefore have to continue to rely o n domestic resources to finance i t s fiscal deficit.

Inthe medium term, improvement o f the credibility o f the public sector as a whole i s o f critical
19.
importance. Improving budget management processes, including those related to service delivery,
together with an efficient and well-motivated civil service are important cornerstones o f such a structural
reform program. This program, combined with additional measures to improve Zambia’s business
environment and delivery of core infrastructure related services, could allow GDP growth rates to be
maintained at an average 3.5-4.5 percent per annum, leading to higher GDP per capita and a sustainable
improvement in the macro environment (see Table 3).
A more vigorous fiscal reform program, as envisaged in the high case, would facilitate increased
20.
access to foreign program funding, reducing the need to rely on domestic financing o f the fiscal deficit.
This in tum would allow more domestic financial resources to be available for private sector
development, allow for a more accommodating monetary policy resulting in a lower interest burden not
only for the State but also for the private sector. In such a reform prone environment, growth could
accelerate to over 5 percent per annum and the central government deficit could reduce to 2.5 percent in
2006. Successful fiscal consolidation, together with forceful implementation o f measures to strengthen
accountability for the use o f public resources and improved service delivery to the poor and vulnerable as
well as a less intrusive investment climate, should bolster confidence in Zambia’s economic prospects.
2 1.
The significantly slower growth path under the l o w case scenario would result from the
Government’s inability to move forcefully ahead with structural reforms in general and public
management reforms in particular. Failure to see through those public expenditure management reforms,
which are part o f the HIPC program, could further delay reaching H I P C completion, increasing Zambia’s
external vulnerability and signal the Government’s inability to effectively implement and control i t s own
public expenditure reform program. In the l o w case, significant budgetary support from external donors

- 8-

will not become available. This would be costly to the State budget, as interest costs would rise
significantly and crowd out growth enhancing and pro-poor expenditures. Fiscal consolidation would be
difficult to accomplish, blocking monetary easing, therefore constraining an expansion o f domestic
activities and harming Zambia’s competitiveness. Growth would return to the dismal figures o f the
1990s, the fiscal deficit would remain high and increase to over 6 percent in 2006, inflation would not
decrease significantly, and GDP per capita would decline.
22.
Indeed, i t i s important to realize that the l o w case scenario cannot be sustained over the full term
o f the C A S without a return to a macroeconomic framework that i s supported by consecutive IMF
programs. Therefore, it i s possible that the l o w case scenario, plagued by an intermittent presence o f an
IMF supported macroeconomic framework, could further deteriorate into a downward economic and
social spiral, which would reverse many o f the recent economic accomplishments. Such a below l o w case
scenario would be characterized by negative GDP growth rates, external debt service arrears, and would
require a major overhaul o f economic policies.
23.
Debt Sustainability and Foreign Financing Needs. Zambia i s benefiting from the enhanced
H I P C debt initiative, having reached i t s HIPC decision point in December 2000 at which time interim
debt relief became available. Under the criteria o f the enhanced HIPC framework, Zambia received a
reduction o f i t s external debt due and outstanding o f 62.6 percent in NPV terms as o f December 3 1, 1999,
which will become irreversible at the completion point. Zambia was expected to reach i t s “floating”
completion point at the end o f 2003. However, because o f slippages with regard to the macroeconomic
program, which made i t impossible to agree o n a new PRGF arrangement with the IMF, the HIPC
completion point has been delayed until at least the second h a l f o f 2004 (see Appendix 6). Nevertheless,
Zambia has received considerable debt service reductions through interim support as part o f the H I P C
program.
24.
The HIPC debt relief reduced Zambia’s NPV o f external debt to export ratio as o f December 3 1,
1999 to a sustainable level o f 150 percent o f exports o f goods and non-factor services. As o f the end o f
2002, however, the ratio stands at 227. This increase has been caused by higher than expected external
borrowing as well as less than projected export revenues. I t should be noted that the additional lending
was mostly emergency, i.e. drought-related lending. As o f end 2003, these developments have resulted in
an estimated NPV o f external debt to export ratio o f 212.4 percent against a projected ratio o f 161 percent
at the decision point. Notwithstanding the fact that Zambia will not attain an NPV o f external debt to
export ratio below 150 at the expected time o f completion i.e. end o f 2004, without topping up at that
time, current projections show however that Zambia will reach such a situation shortly thereafter.
Zambia’s external position as measured by i t s current account balance has improved over the last
25.
two years. Export diversification, i.e. into agro-processing and horticulture, as well as a recovery in
copper prices has helped to increase export revenues. At the same time, demand for imports has lagged
behind export developments leading to an improved, but s t i l l rather large, cufrent account deficit. The
current account deficit for 2003 as a whole i s estimated t o be 14.8 percent o f GDP; under the base case
scenario the external balance i s projected to improve to 13.3 percent in 2006. Under the high case,
bolstered by stronger export performance, the current account balance i s expected to improve to 11.6
percent in 2006, while in the l o w case the current account balance i s projected at 14.3 percent in 2006,
even though availability o f foreign financing will limit imports (see Table 3).
26.
Between 2004 and 2006, gross external financing under the base case scenario is estimated at
US$3.17 billion (see Table 4). These resources would finance U S 1 . 8 6 billion in current account deficits,
a US$270 million increase in international reserves, and the remainder for scheduled debt repayments.
Private investments are expected to finance about 10 percent o f these needs, partly driven by privatization
transactions in the banking sector and the transfer o f K C M to a new private partner. The remaining

- 9-

financing for the period 2004-06 will come from combination o f grants (32 percent), debt relief (28
percent), concessional loans (25 percent), and other capital inflows (4 percent).

I V . ZAMBIA’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY AND WAY
FORWARD
Zambia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), covering the period 2002-2004, was
27.
presented to the Board in M a y 2002. An Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) had been
presented to the Board in July 2000. The PRSP was substantially complete when the new Government
took office in January 2002. The new Government endorsed the PRSP and went further to expand the
PRSP in the Transitional National Development Plan (TNDP) that was published in October 2002.

28.
Strategic focus of the PRSP. The PRSP highlights the following barriers to poverty reduction:
lack o f economic growth, high inequality, excessive dependence on foreign aid, poor prioritization o f
public resources, inadequate safety nets, and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the PRSP seeks to achieve poverty
reduction through promoting (i)
economic growth and diversification o f production and exports; (ii)
improved access and quality in the provision of social services; and (iii)
the mainstreaming o f
crosscutting issues o f governance, HIV/AIDS, gender, and the environment. Targets and indicators are
provided for each sector and sub-sector. For example, by 2004 the poverty headcount i s to be reduced to
65 percent, the same as in 1996. Even though the MDGs are not explicitly mentioned in the PRSP, given
that the MDGs were not widely discussed when Zambia prepared i t s PRSP, some o f the targets for
improvements in the social indicators are similar to the MDGs.
29.
Macroeconomic stability i s seen as a prerequisite
for private sector-led, export-oriented growth, and the
PRSP gives prominence to the issue o f good governance
and zero tolerance o f corruption. I t states that the
Government i s very committed to improving public
expenditure management, strengthening the AntiCorruption Commission, and implementing the National
Capacity Building Program for Good Governance. This
program focuses o n increasing the access o f the
population to justice, decentralizing government
functions, and improving communications between the
Government and the people. As stressed in the PRSP,
poverty i s also a result o f the poor delivery o f public services in the social sectors. The PRSP, therefore,
places emphasis o n improving the delivery o f social services, especially education and health.

30.
A number o f structural measures aimed at stimulating private investment and improving the
regulatory and financial environment are discussed in the PRSP. It emphasizes the enforcement o f a hard
budget constraint on the remaining parastatals with a view to reducing or eliminating the quasi-fiscal
deficits that have added to inflationary pressures, which in turn have underlined the prevailing high real
interest rates. I t also places great emphasis on agriculture, tourism, agro-processing, small-scale mining,
and supporting infrastructure, which would benefit the rural areas where poverty levels are above average.
As Zambia i s suffering from high unemployment, the PRSP stresses activities that have the potential to
absorb labor o n a large scale.

3 1.
The PRSP gives the highest priority to agriculture in the diversification o f production and
exports, employment creation, income generation, and promotion o f food security. I t sees a role for
expanded commercial farming existing side by side with small-scale farming, which can benefit fkom
large farms through out-grower schemes. I t stresses the need to proceed cautiously in dealing with the
allocation o f land, much of which i s s t i l l subject to traditional forms o f tenure, so as to protect the rights
- 11-

o f smallholders and the environment. It envisages that small and medium scale enterprises would be
given particular encouragement. With regard to mining, the PRSP i s realistic enough to recognize that the
sector would continue to play a significant role in the economy.
32.
Government spending well below what was originally envisaged has hampered execution o f the
PRSP. The Government acknowledges that little progress was made during the f i r s t two years with
implementation o f sectoral programs. I t points to erratic and insufficient releases o f resources and
administrative bottlenecks as the main reasons for lack o f progress. In addition, a growth conducive
macroeconomic environment remained elusive due to slippages in fiscal policy (see paragraph 11).
Impact analysis and managing for results i s hindered by a highly fragmented monitoring and evaluation
system. Even though a poverty monitoring and analysis framework (PMA) has been designed and
assigned t o the Ministry of Finance and Planning, it has not become fully operational yet (see also Section
VII, Monitoring and Evaluation within a Results-Based Framework). Zambia has launched the f i r s t
PRSP Progress Review, holding stakeholder consultations and working group seminars. The f i r s t
Progress Report i s expected to be finalized in mid-2004 and presented to the Board in Fall 2005.

The challengefor achieving results. Zambia’s success or failure in achieving the goals i t has set
33.
for itself in the PRSP and TNDP, and hence making progress towards the MDGs, will take more than just
renewed Government commitment to reform. Therefore, Zambia needs to break with the past. The past
i s marked by stop-gap economic policy reforms, which have brought the country to i t s present state o f
impoverishment. Breaking with the past means regaining and sustaining the momentum o f reform that
was lost during the second h a l f o f the 1990s with a strong emphasis on implementation and follow
through. This i s the opportunity that presents itself to the current administration.
34.
The Government must lead the way. This means essentially elevating economic and social
development to the top o f the Government’s agenda and taking systematic measures to deal with the
factors responsible for the poor performance and accountability o f the public sector. The widespread
poverty in Zambia i s not due to lack o f natural resources. O n the contrary, Zambia has a r i c h endowment
o f land, minerals, water, and forests. It has also been the beneficiary o f large inflows o f donor funds,
despite i t s poor track record o f implementing economic reforms. The poor track record on reforms and i t s
implementation i s a manifestation o f lack o f ownership and political commitment. Ownership in turn
means building a strong constituency for reform so that a vision for development that i s broadly shared by
opposition parties, civil society, and the private sector emerges. In addition t o lack o f ownership and
commitment, the main factors responsible for poor performance and accountability include: the lack o f
ardent agents o f change, a weak system o f rewards and sanctions, and a style o f public administration that
i s long on strategizing and short on implementation.

sweeping liberalization o f the economy dominated, accounting for nearly 40 percent o f total commitments
(see Appendix 2.2). T o underpin lending, IDA undertook a considerable amount o f AAA, including
Country Economic Memoranda (CEM), Poverty Assessments (PA), and Public Expenditure Reviews
(PER) (see Appendix 2.3).
The Zambian portfolio has generally been plagued by slow disbursement and weak
36.
implementation capacity. The past decade has been n o exception. Slow disbursement i s due to
inadequate and irregular releases o f Government counterpart funds, inefficient and slow procurement, and
weak project management. All this reflects poorly on Government ownership and commitment. A
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out at the end o f June 2003 and agreement
was reached o n a comprehensive action plan to improve portfolio performance. Since the CPPR, the
actual release o f counterpart funds for most projects shows a marked improvement over previous years.
Selected indicators o f portfolio performance during the last C A S period (1999-2003) are presented in
Annex B2.

Evaluation of IDA’Sassistance strategy in Zambia. At the beginning o f 1992, Zambia was
37.
facing a dire economic situation. The country was in the grip o f a severe drought, inflation was running
at over 100 percent, and external debt payment arrears had built up t o unserviceable levels. Nevertheless,
the circumstances were also propitious because a democratically elected Government had taken over the
reins o f power. Since 1992, IDA assistance has focused o n macroeconomic stabilization, privatization,
public sector management, infrastructure development, and the provision o f basic services such as
education, health, and safe water. This focus was and remains relevant to the Zambian situation. The
instruments deployed have been broadly appropriate. During President Chiluba’s first term (1992-1996),
when the Government exhibited ownership and commitment, the efficacy o f IDA’S assistance was
obvious: inflation was brought down sharply, privatization proceeded at a rapid pace, and progress was
made in halting the deterioration o f basic services. During President Chiluba’s second term, when
ownership and commitment waned, the results o f IDA-supported programs were often elusive.
38.
OED’s November 2002 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), covering the FY96-01 period,
concluded that the outcomes f r o m the 1996 CAS and the 1999 C A S were generally poor. The C A E noted
that progress on macroeconomic stabilization was particularly disappointing despite the considerable
amount o f adjustment lending that took place. The CAE went o n to recommend better use o f the
instruments at the Bank’s disposal so as to have the greatest impact in three areas that i t identified as
being o f primary importance for economic growth and poverty reduction. These are: public expenditure
management and governance, the investment climate, and H I V / A I D S .

Lessons Learned and Breaking with the Past. The main lessons can be categorized along three
39.
interrelated themes: (i)
ownership; (ii)
focus; and (iii)
implementation. The main recommendations along
these three dimensions from the review o f the 1999 CAS4 and OED’s CAE are as follows:
0

Ownership

- Country dialogue and ownership have to go beyond pro-forma consultations between

Government and other stakeholders, with the Government seen to be actually taking into
account the views o f all major stakeholders and not just those o f the foreign donors.
- Reforms are not likely to be sustained if policy dialogue i s confined to a small economic team
in Government (Minister o f Finance, a handful o f sector Ministers, Governor o f the central
bank) and the majority o f the political leadership i s excluded and thus not well informed.
0

0

Focus
- In the absence o f improved governance and public sector management as well as a stable
macroeconomic environment, liberalization and privatization by themselves could not provide
the stimulus for increased private investment.
- Investment in the modernization o f agriculture has to be an essential element o f a diversified
and pro-poor growth strategy.
Implementation

- A focus only on preparation o f a given piece o f economic and sector work, without enough

-

attention paid to dissemination o f the report and feeding i t s findings into dialogue and lending
operations, i s inadequate.
Implementation i s key to a successful reform program. The weak implementation in Zambia
was partly due to shortage o f qualified personnel in certain key areas but largely due to
inadequate incentives and sanctions and to the pervasive failure to apply laws and regulations
and adhere to established systems and procedures.

A turn-around o f recent trends in Zambia requires not only breaking with the past for the
40.
Government but also for the Bank. This CAS incorporates the lessons learned and proposes a different
way o f doing business:
0

Ownership

- The CAS i s explicitly aligned with the goals o f the PRSP/TNDP. Monitoring o f CAS

implementation i s embedded in the progress monitoring o f the PRSP/TNDP.

- Consultations beyond Government. The preparation o f the CAS was carried out in close

consultations with a broad range o f stakeholders, including NGOs, academia, private sector,
and donors. This process will be maintained during CAS implementation and the Bank will
carry out annual “programming” missions t o discuss progress towards the CAS outcomes with
the Government, civil society organizations, and development partners.

0

Focus
- The Bank’s focus i s selective and on key areas where it has a comparative advantage in
Zambia as shown by proven expertise and global knowledge. Where other donors have a
comparative advantage, the Bank will aim to play a catalytic role and support the development
agenda through strong partnership.
- The CAS places strong emphasis on the enabling environment for the private sector to drive
growth and wealth creation. For instance in the energy sector, the approach shifts from an

Several more specific lessons in each area o f the previous C A S are contained in Appendix 8: C A S Completion
Report.

- 14-

exclusive focus on household electrification to covering social (heath, education, water) and
income generating (SMEs, agriculture, agro-processing, tourism, etc) activities.
- The C A S gives explicit recognition to strengthening public sector management, accountability,
and transparency. Special focus i s given t o sound public finance management and improved
service delivery.
- The Bank assistance i s geared towards supporting development o f strong leadership and
commitment to economic reforms by focusing on the incentive structures and accountability o f
the public sector and inducing behavior change.
0

Implementation

- Focus o n Results. The CAS goes beyond the outline o f lending and ESW. I t sets out from the

desired long-term development outcomes and traces the Bank’s interventions t o specific
performance indicators aligned with Zambia’s PRSP/TNDP.
- Managing for Results. The results framework (see Figure 3), reflected in the C A S results
matrices (see Appendix 3), augments traditional monitoring o f inputs (lending) and portfolio
deliveries (disbursements) by explicitly identifying the outcomes/activities that would be
achieved during the C A S period. AAA and lending operations, planned against specific CAS
outcomes, will remain a dynamic and flexible tool and resources will be redirected in response
to changing country conditions.
- Implementation o f the existing portfolio will be a priority under this CAS. In the short term,
progress, especially in the area o f human development, will result mainly from ongoing
projects.
- With regard to new lending the Bank will be more selective in terms o f sectors, instruments,
and with regard to BOP support in the absence o f a sustainable macroeconomic framework.

to be reached during the CAS period have been specified. For the C A S period, the B a n k will track

To complement the results focus o f the CAS, the package o f Bank support will comprise o f the
42.
three “Ps”: (i)
Programs (existing portfolio and new lending), (ii)
policy dialogue, and (iii)
partnerships.
In particular, major strides towards the targeted outcomes during the CAS period are linked to the existing
portfolio. N e w lending i s selective, based o n analytical work, and proposed in partnership with other
donors with the aim to further harmonize donor support. The role o f policy dialogue and AAA i s
amplified and similar to that in a LICUS country.

Focus o f W o r l d Bank activities - T h r e e Strategic Priorities
Strategic Priority 1: Sustained Economic Growth Anchored in a Diversified and Export-Oriented
Economy
Zambia’s quest for sustained poverty reduction depends largely o n achieving macroeconomic
43.
stability and creating an economic environment conducive for growth, diversification, and exportorientation (see Table 5). These goals depend critically on improvements in Zambia’s investment and the
external trade climate, ability to provide access to affordable financial resources, and to have in place
reliable and cost effective infrastructure, while safeguarding the environment. As each o f these enabling
factors depend on interactions with the public sector, improvements in governance and public sector
management are critical (see strategic priority 3).

A Growth Conducive Macroeconomic Environment
Context. Macroeconomic stability has been elusive for Zambia despite several IMF programs
44.
and a number o f structural adjustment credits in support o f this objective f r o m the Bank. This

- 16-

notwithstanding, the current economic environment o f positive growth undoubtedly provides
opportunities to make the tough choices needed to reach and sustain macroeconomic stability.

Issues and obstacles. An agreement with the IMF o n a macroeconomic transition path towards a
growth conducive macroeconomic environment o f l o w and stable inflation, l o w and stable real interest
rates, which i s supported by an affordable fiscal policy that refrains from domestic borrowing, would
unleash significant budgetary support by other I F I s and bilateral donors. This would allow Zambia to
reach the HIPC completion point, make the interim debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative
permanent and irrevocable, and greatly enhance the sustainability o f the current growth spurt that Zambia
i s experiencing.

CAS Outcome Indicators which this CAS aims to influence and
which are aligned to the longer term country outcomes
Improved management o f public resources as measured by:

Reduced domestic borrowing requirements from an estimated 3% o f
GDP in 2003 to less than 1YOo f GDP annually beginning no later
than 2005
Reduced arrears o f Govemment (including parastatals) from an
estimated 2% o f GDP in 2003 to almost zero
Resolution o f state owned financial institutions by 2006
Administrative barriers to exports, investment and production are
reduced

Pay refunds for duty drawback are o f an acceptable speed for the
private sector by 2007
Improved perception o f foreign and domestic investors o f the
investment climate in Zambia, especially in mining, by 2007
Financial management and sustainability of infrastructure services i s
improved with an increase in private investment for service
provision

Increased percentage at core road network (paved and unpaved
roads) in good condition from 58% and 7% in 2004 to 65% and 32%
in 2006 respectively
Coverage o f the core road network under routine maintenance from
19.5% in 2004 to 40% in 2006 with local community participation
A l l three stages o f the commercialization roadmap for ZESCO are
completed, meeting all agreed milestones

Intensive consultations among the main institutions in Zambia responsible for macroeconomic
46.
policy are needed t o bring about consensus on h o w to achieve a healthier macroeconomic environment. It
i s important t o recognize that layoffs in loss-making public enterprises are likely in order to return them
t o profitability. Rationalizing the civil service, as a means to regain control over the public sector wage
bill and subsequently over public expenditures, will also be required. However, both these much needed
interventions will require affordable social mitigation measures. In addition, the Government should
integrate the economic, fiscal, and social consequences o f the H N / A I D S pandemic and budget adequate
resources to tackle the emerging needs in this area.

47.
A deeper and broader financial system that i s not burdened by loss-making public financial
institutions, has an independent central bank with a regulatory and supervisory capacity t o monitor
financial developments, and which i s in compliance with international accounting, auditing, and
prudential regulation standards, would greatly contribute to the macroeconomic environment. In addition,
the financial system would also be able to play i t s proper role as an intermediary between providers and
consumers o f financial resources in Zambia.
Bank program. The Bank’s interventions are geared towards improving the Government’s
48.
ability to manage i t s resources efficiently and effectively in a transparent and accountable manner (see
strategic priority 3) as well as through AAA, and in the high and base cases through adjustment lending.
During this C A S period, this should lead to a reduced need to borrow domestically, reduced arrears o f the
Government, as well as a credible preparation and predictable execution o f the Government’s budget.
Follow up with regard to the recently completed FSAP will guide the Bank’s policy dialogue in
49.
thefinancial sector in close collaboration with the IMF. In the high lending case, the Bank would also
financially support the needed improvements in the financial sector, while the assistance would be
provided under the umbrella o f adjustment credits in the base case. These interventions would support
the resolution o f the remaining state owned financial institutions such as the divestiture o f Z A N A C O and
support the implementation o f the FSAP recommendations in the field o f legal and regulatory foundations
for the sector.

A Diversified and Export Oriented Economy

50.
Context. T o better protect i t s citizens against adverse terms o f trade shocks and frequently
occurring droughts, i t i s important for Zambia to diversify i t s economy and to be export-oriented. Inthe
past, Zambia’s economy was too dependent on copper as an economic activity as well as i t s foreign
exchange revenues. In addition, a strategy for agriculture that facilitates opportunities for outgrowers and
assists with the additional infrastructure needed to bring agricultural produce t o the market i s a crucial
part o f a diversification strategy.
Zambia plays a major role in the Southern Africa subregion and i s a member o f S A D C and
5 1.
COMESA. Complementarity between national and regional strategies and programs i s key for Zambia’s
and the subregion’s economic progress. Therefore, the crosscutting issues o f regional coordination and
integration are priorities for land-locked Zambia, especially with regard to her immediate neighbors.
Strong economic growth critically depends on access to sub-Saharan and overseas international markets,
and therefore requires an active participation in regional and international trade bodies and their
negotiations. In addition, regional integration and coordination with regard to provision o f services could
also bring significant gains to Zambia. Zambia’s competitiveness would benefit from such regional
initiatives, as increasing retums to scale would reduce the cost o f service provision. An example o f such
ongoing regional cooperation i s Zambia’s participation in the Southern African Power Pool project and
the planned H I V / A D S corridor project. Furthermore, Zambia would play a central role in a subregional
context o f water resources management in the Zambezi basin.

- 18-

Issues and obstacles. Progress in several areas would contribute t o diversifying Zambia’s export
52.
and economic structure. First, a more friendly international trade environment in Zambia that provides
incentives for exports through effective export processing zones and a more efficient custom
administration i s an important building block.

53.
Second, a’competitive and simplified tax structure; streamlined, accountable and transparent
procedures for granting business licenses; continued efforts to commercialize public enterprises that
undertake private sector activities; and strengthening the regulatory and competition frameworks would
greatly improve the climatefor private investment and development in Zambia.
Third, the status o f play with regard to the provision of infrastructural services that facilitate
54.
economic development, in particular in the rural areas, does not match the demands resulting from the
robust economic growth needed to improve living conditions in Zambia. I t i s important to ensure sound
financial management in the infrastructural sectors by enforcing a hard budget constraint o n each sectorpower, water, telecommunications and transport-while allowing cost recovery tariff setting or, as in the
case o f roads, providing adequate funding for maintenance as a priority. The gap between current
infrastructure provision and the level required for an adequate infrastructure platform for diversification
and growth cannot be met from (domestic) public resources alone. T o induce private participation in
investment, significant improvements must be made in the regulation o f the infrastructure sector t o help
mitigate the associated risks and to create appropriate incentives.
Fourth, there i s need to upgrade the skills of Zambia’s labor force and therefore to reform i t s
55.
vocational training programs. The changing structure o f Zambia’s economy has increased the importance
o f investing in people in order to provide laborers with new skills that are needed in today and
tomorrow’s economy. The current curriculum o f public training institutions does not provide new
graduates with the skills needed to find jobs. Studies carried out in the past and interviews with
employers indicate that many employers are uninterested in employing graduates from existing public
institutions.

56.
Fifth, there i s a need to integrate environmental concems into development. Just as increasing
poverty can lead people desperate for survival to abuse the environment, so also can efforts to promote
wealth creation set in motion activities that are harmful to the environment. The Government and people
o f Zambia therefore need t o be vigilant as the country strives to achieve sustained and diversified
economic growth. Environmental regulatory agencies need to be strengthened and policies enforced. At
the same time, a delicate balance has to be struck so that concern for the environment does not become an
obstacle to development, which i s needed t o reduce poverty.
57.
Sixth, in agriculture a two-pronged development strategy comprising (i)
support for raising the
productivity o f smallholder crop and livestock systems in a sustainable manner (especially arresting the
spread o f animal diseases), and (ii)
support for commercial agriculture with outgrower linkages i s key to a
diversified, export-led economy. Zambia i s a sleeping agricultural giant, with one o f the best land and
water endowments in Afnca and an above average human resource base, even in the smallholder sector.
I t s comparatively huge agricultural potential in the smallholder agriculture and emerging commercial
farm sector needs to be unleashed to tap not only into the limited domestic market, but also into the
regional (South Africa, Zimbabwe, DRC, Namibia and Botswana), and international markets. T o do this
would require reducing macro-distortions and deepening rural financial services, having a competitive
rural infrastructure (e.g., irrigation, dip tanks for livestock, agricultural access roads, post-harvest
infrastructure); strengthening front line services, and building strong linkage to markets.
The poverty and social impact assessments (PSIA) undertaken in Zambia’s rural areas reinforce
58.
the need for an integrated approach to rural development to make a significant impact on rural poverty

- 19-

reduction (see Appendix 5). This analysis shows that an approach that takes into account traditional rural
relationships with regard to land ownerships, the need for access to markets as a means to provide cash
incomes, together with affordable but market based credit mechanisms that allow for (fertilizer) inputs to
b e obtained and used, could potentially help smallholders to improve their situation.

59.
Bank program. The Bank program will support diversification through a combination o f lending
and AAA. I t will build upon the conclusion reached at the National Workshop on Export Diversification
(May 2002), w h i c h brought together senior government officials, including the President, private sector,
donors, academics, c i v i l society and discussed best practices f r o m international experiences in export
diversification in Malaysia, Thailand, Mauritius, Ireland, South Africa, Botswana, and Kenya. This
workshop l e d directly to the establishment o f the National (public-private) Council o n Export
Diversification.
The Government’s trade agenda will be supported through the integrated framework exercise in
60.
collaboration with the Bank’s partners in the area o f trade. This should help the Government to introduce
an effective duty drawback system as w e l l as to adopt institutional arrangements that allow exporters t o
take advantage o f trade preferences extended under AGOA and EBA. T o improve Zambia’s investment
climate, the Bank and I F C will assist the Government with analytical work, notably an Investment
Climate Assessment and a FIAS-led Administrative Barriers to Investment study. These studies are
geared to facilitate the adoption o f a new and more business friendly investment act and result in regular
consultations between business and Government to discuss h o w to strengthen Zambia’s business climate.

61.
The SEED project will support the Government’s implementation o f a diversification strategy in
the tourism, agribusiness, and gemstone sectors. In the initial phase, the SEED project will focus on
supporting the design and establishment o f appropriate policy and legal frameworks to encourage private
investments in the three high potential sectors as well as also investments, primarily in tourism-related
infrastructure. The tourism component will w o r k toward making Livingstone the flagship tourism
destination in Zambia and strengthen management o f national parks, w h i c h underpin Zambia’s medium
t e r m tourism development strategy. The interventions in the gemstones and agribusiness components are
to strengthen the supply chain that links rural/small-scale producers to local and export markets.
In the infrastructural sectors, the economic program agreed to as part o f the HIPC initiative will
assist the need to turn ZESCO around into a financially viable company that operates o n commercial
terms. AAA will assist the Government with identifying m a i n bottlenecks with regard to competition and
effective service delivery in the sector. The policy recommendations and institutional changes would be
supported through adjustment operations in the high lending scenario, while the ongoing and proposed
investment projects, Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) and the Water Sector Reform
Project, would provided financial resources needed to undertake the actual investments. Zambia will also
benefit from the Southern African Power Pool Project.

62.

In the area o f technical education, vocational, and entrepreneurship training (TEVET), the
Government i s carrying out reforms aimed at improving the quality o f TEVET training, making i t more
responsive to labor market demand, making it financially sustainable, and increasing the participation o f

63.

female trainees and trainees f r o m socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The Government ’ s efforts in
this area are being supported by an IDA Credit committed in FYO1, and by several other partners.

The Bank i s reengaging in the agricultural sector given the priority Zambia itself attaches to this
sector as set out in the PRSP/TNDP. If the macroeconomic environment can be improved, supporting
infkastructure put in place and an improved agricultural sectoral policy defined, a major effort could be
launched to unleash this growth and poverty reduction potential through well-targeted interventions for
b o t h smallholders and commercial agnculture. AAA i s planned to support the formulation o f an
64.

- 20-

agricultural policy that i s consistent with planned and ongoing activities in related sectors such as roads
and electricity to remove bottlenecks that prohibit and or make i t difficult for farmers t o produce for the
market. Hence, the policy dialogue with the Government on reform and priorities o f public spending for
agriculture and rural development will address both short run policy issues holding back the sector, as
w e l l as helping formulate a long run strategy to tap the large agricultural export potential o f the country,
through investment in land development, irrigation, and infrastructure. Balanced treatment o f
smallholders and commercial agriculture i s important for growth and poverty reduction. As a follow-up
to the AAA work, an Agricultural Support Project i s planned to assist the Government with these
challenges.
Environmental concerns are addressed as part of each individual project as laid down in the
65,
Bank’s safeguard policies and directly through the Bank’s environmental project in the Copperbelt, which
will assist Government with the cleanup o f several hazardous sides in the Copperbelt and Kabwe area.
The proposed SEED project will assist the Government with sustainability o f tourism in protected areas.

Strategic Priority 2: Improved Lives and Protection o f the Vulnerable
Human development indicators have been declining along with increased poverty levels and
66.
ineffective delivery o f basic services. In addition, the mechanisms that offered a measure o f protection for
vulnerable individuals and communities under the now-defunct welfare state have largely disappeared
(see Table 6).

Better Health and Long-Term Survival, with Particular Focus on Vulnerable Groups
Context. Zambia’s health sector was one o f the first sectors in any country to pioneer a sector67.
wide approach for donor assistance, which began in 1992. Under the n e w administration, strong
leadership has been restored to the Ministry o f Health, and the sector-wide program has been
reconstituted, with active support from a number o f international partners. The priorities in the health
sector are t o deliver a basic health care package, address the human resource constraints facing the sector,
improve efficiency o f resource mobilization and allocation, control communicable diseases, and improve
partnerships by involving civil society and private sector in the delivery of health services. The PRSP
and TNDP place a special emphasis on control o f malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and sexuallytransmitted infections (STI); integrated reproductive health care; child health care; and provision o f safe
water and sanitation
Issues and obstacles. The health challenges in Zambia are immense, and adverse economic
68.
conditions augmented by weak institutional capacity and ineffective spending have undermined the
overall effectiveness o f the health system. I t i s essential for Zambia to make more efficient use o f the
financial and human resources in the health system, with the aim o f improving the retention and
deployment o f the health sector workforce as well as the allocation o f financial resources. Ensuing equity
in access to basic services, particularly for underserved regions and poor and vulnerable groups, i s
another key priority. M a n y o f the rural poor lack access to health services, and costs associated with
treatment can be considerable. Zambia’s poor have substantially worse health outcomes than the better
off. In addition, Zambia’s PRSP and i t s Health Sector Strategic Plan recognize that the determinants o f
health outcomes go beyond health services and improvements in health services must be accompanied
e.g. by better access to clean water and sanitation, rising productivity in agriculture and greater food
security.

HIV/AIDS has reached alarming proportions in Zambia, and presents a unique challenge: Zambia
69.
i s entering i t s third decade o f two-digit H I V / A I D S prevalence. A National Strategic Framework for
H I V / A I D S control has been developed and i s being coordinated by the National H I V / A I D S Council

- LI-

(NAC). The Government’s priorities as described in the PRSP/TNDP are to reduce HIV/AIDS infections
through better communication aiming for a behavioral change and promotion o f condom use; expand
access to voluntary counseling and testing facilities; promote community and home-based care o f
HIV/AIDS patients; expand anti-retro viral treatment; provide support for AIDS orphans; and improve the
management and treatment o f TB, STI, and other opportunistic infections.

Bankprogram. At this time, IDA i s assisting the Ministry o f Health with a US$12 million
subcomponent under multi-sectoral AIDS program (ZANARA). In addition, IDA i s carrying out E S W o n
human resources in the health sector (FY04) and planning a health sector PER in FY06. Assistance to the
Ministry o f Health will be expanded through a proposed Health Sector Credit in FY06. Building on this,
IDA will provide support for the Health Sector Support Program (SWAP) beginning in FY07. The
improvement o f water supplies under the M i n e Township Services Project will also contribute to
improved health outcomes in the areas served.
The H I V / A I D S National Strategic Framework i s receiving support from the Bank and a range o f
7 1.
other bilateral and multilateral donors. These efforts have yet to begin to bear fruit. Continued donor
support, together with improved donor coordination, i s urgently needed in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
In Zambia, a sustained political leadership, similar to Uganda and Botswana, i s required to help mobilize
support for behavior change and increased use o f condoms, and to work towards the elimination o f the
stigma attached t o the disease.

Coverage and Quality o f Education
72.
Context. F r o m 1999 through 2003, the Ministry o f Education implemented a Basic Education
Subsector Investment Program (BESSIP), supported by twelve external financing agencies, including the
Bank. Accomplishments during this period included construction o f more than 2,000 classrooms,
procurement o f several m i l l i o n textbooks, and successful piloting o f the teaching o f initial literacy in
Zambian languages; and piloting o f School Health and Nutrition (SHN) interventions.
73.
Issues and obstacles. Despite recent progress, textbook availability in schools remains uneven,
due to weaknesses in distribution, and teacher distribution has remained skewed in favor o f urban areas.
Moreover, teachers are underpaid, too few in number, and frequently absent. In 2002, the Government
introduced an initiative o f Free Education at grades 1-7, under which PTA fees are prohibited for those
grades, and with grants given to schools to compensate them for the loss o f P T A revenue. Enrollment in
grades 1-7 grew by 2 percent annually during 1999-200 1 and then jumped by 7 percent in 2002. In the
PRSP and TNDP, the Government has stated the provision o f universal free and compulsory basic
education as one o f i t s goals (grades 1-9).
74.
The Government’s education sector priorities for this CAS period are set out in the Ministry o f
Education’s Strategic Plan 2003-07, which represents the Ministry’s broader successor t o BESSIP. The
Plan aims at increasing the grade 1 admission rate from an estimated 94 percent in 2002 to 100 percent in
2007, and increasing the grade 7 completion rate from an estimated 65 percent in 2002 to 86 percent in
2007. Among the means for achieving these objectives are: extension o f initial literacy in Zambian
languages; extension o f S H N interventions; decentralization o f responsibilities for textbook procurement
and distribution; and increased incentives for teachers to work in rural areas. The Plan also aims at
increasing enrollment rates in upper basic education (grades 8-9) and high school (grades 10-12), and at
improved efficiency in university education
75.
For the longer term, a key MDG i s universal primary completion, n o later than 2015. The
achievement o f 100 percent admission by 2007, as intended in the Plan, would facilitate this. Based on
the evidence o f low-income countries which have already achieved high primary completion rates, an
“Indicative Framework” o f efficient and fiscally sustainable service delivery parameters for universal
primary completion has been endorsed by official agencies supporting education in developing countries.
In relation to the Indicative Framework, a weakness o f the Zambian education system i s that children in
grades 1-4 attend school only 630 hours per year. This i s because each teacher for grades 1-4 teaches two
shifts, which i s believed to contribute to the l o w levels o f learning achievement observed in Zambia. This
problem remains to be addressed by the Government over the longer term.

- 23-

76.
Bank program. The Bank i s currently supporting the Ministry o f Education’s efforts through
Adaptable Program Lending (APL). The APLl Credit enables IDA funds to be devoted to a wide range
o f purposes in basic education and, following an amendment, to construct two high schools in Eastern
Province. IDA expects that the APL2 Credit, to be committed in FY06, will support the education sector
more broadly. The Bank will support the expenditure effectiveness and efficiency and management
issues in the sector through a sector focused PER.
Better Protection of Vulnerable Individuals and Communities

77.
Context. The vulnerable members o f society include those who are malnourished; those living
with HIViAIDS and AIDS orphans; women (particularly household heads) and youths; pensioners who
are not being paid at all or whose pensions have been eroded by inflation; people living in very remote
areas; and the unemployed.
Issues and obstacles. Those most in need have only limited access to safety nets and subsidies;
78.
their situation i s further compromised by extemal shocks such as droughts and flooding, and weak
capacity o f the Government to design and implement measures to mitigate these shocks.
Food security i s a particular concern for Zambia because the country suffers from frequent
79.
droughts. While safety nets should be strengthened, and better targeted on the poorest and most
vulnerable, i t i s equally important to remove impediments to growth in agriculture productivity,
particularly in drought-prone areas, and to promote greater diversification in small-holder agriculture.

Bankprogram. In light o f the complex and crosscutting nature o f risk and vulnerability in
80.
Zambia, the Bank i s assisting Government in developing a cross-sectoral Social Protection Strategy. The
Strategy will extend beyond traditional expost risk-coping measures (e.g. safety nets) to include a better
understanding o f the role o f ex ante risk-prevention and risk-mitigation measures. The Strategy i s being
prepared in a highly participatory fashion, with the aim o f integrating it within Zambia’s next PRSP. F o r
the same purpose the Bank will undertake a Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment.
The Rural Development Sector Strategy and i t s follow-up Agriculture Support Project will
8 1.
contribute in important ways to higher agriculture productivity and overall food security. In addition, the
Bank i s assisting Zambia in developing an Integrated Framework for Disaster Relief and Mitigation intended as multi-sectoral response to anticipate and address the impacts o f climate shocks - under the
ongoing Emergency Drought Recovery Project (EDRP). The aim i s to increase food security and protect
living conditions for the poorest and most vulnerable in target districts; pilot programs are being designed
t o manage and protect against climate shocks, including dams and local irrigation, labor intensive public
works, and agriculture input distribution programs. Feeding programs will be implemented in primary
schools in a subset o f districts; young children in Zambia are particularly at risk to high and rising levels
o f malnutrition.

Strategic Priority 3: Efficiently and Effectively Managed Public Sector

82.
Improving governance and public sector management are crucial for poverty reduction in
Zambia. While macroeconomic stability and private investment are preconditions for stimulating growth,
the effective delivery o f basic services depends upon improving the performance o f the public sector.
Though the broad outlines o f the reform process are widely known and accepted, the commitment and
capacity to undertake the required actions i s often lacking.

- 24-

A Transparent and Accountable Public Sector
Context. Zambia’s quality o f economic governance has been o n the decline since the second h a l f
83,
o f the 1990s. Today public resources are not well spent, and have very little impact o n poverty. While
several steps may be needed to reverse this trend, a crucial first step will be to start making sound
budgetary allocations that will support poverty reduction and to increase transparency in budget
allocations- i.e. making the public aware o f the Government’s budgetary decisions and holding the
Government accountable for better performance. Only through a transparent and accountable public
sector will it be possible for Zambians to develop workable strategies to tackle the many economic
challenges, including the rising poverty.

Issues and obstacles. Zambia faces three key challenges in ensuring a transparent and
84.
accountable public sector.

85.
First, the budget system lacks transparency and effectiveness. Under normal circumstances, the
budget preparation should reflect a process o f strategic allocation in which Govemment aligns i t s policy
priorities with available financial resources. Yet, the process has mostly broken down in Zambia: budget
outcomes vary widely from the intended plan, and there i s ineffective political engagement in budget
preparation. The budget focuses largely around inputs rather than outputs and i s preoccupied with only
the immediate year. The M e d i u m Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), although initiated in the
budget for 2004, i s yet to be fully integrated into the budgetary process to allow for closer alignment o f
policies and resources and better definition o f budget priorities in accordance with the PRSP and TNDP.

The environment in place for improved performance by the civil
service i s strengthened:

Composition of staffing shifts toward support of service delivery
functions

86.
Second, the public procurement system lacks transparency and effectiveness. Inefficiencies in the
public procurement process and inconsistent application o f procurement regulations have led to a high
level o f wastage and opportunities for corruption. The Bank’s 2002 Country Procurement Assessment
Review (CPAR) outlined a number o f key reforms that should be implemented to improve the public
procurement management. The main C A S outcomes will be improved legal, regulatory, and policy
framework for procurement; a more decentralized procurement system (with full decentralization by

- 25-

2008); an effective recourse mechanism for fair treatment o f bidders’ complaints; and a stronger anticorruption commission equipped to handle procurement related corruption issues.

87.
Finally, accountability and transparency in the use ofpublic funds is inadequate. Budget
implementation, monitoring, and reporting tend to be ad hoc and perfunctory rather than systematic. The
watchdog institutions for public accountability and transparency are weak. The Office o f the Auditor
General has faced enormous resource and staff constraints to carry out i t s duties effectively. Full and
timely disclosure of audited financial statements has lagged behind what i s provided for in the Zambian
law. The parliamentary oversight over budget has been weak. And the fight against corruption has not
been well integrated into the public sector improvement program. Corruption undermines confidence in
the entire system o f public administration, it siphons o f f resources sorely needed to meet the basic needs
o f the population, and it deters private investment.

88.
Bankprogram. The Bank program will support these areas through a combination o f lending
and AAA. In PFMA, the Bank’s long-term objective i s to encourage a more transparent and accountable
public sector by improving budget management, procurement systems, and the accountability o f public
funds. During the C A S period, the Bank program will assist to:
0

restore the role o f the budget not only as an instrument for determining Government priorities,
but also as an instrument for exercising discipline in the use o f limited public resources;
strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for public procurement to tighten the loopholes
for corruption;
strengthen the policy and regulatory functions o f the Zambia National Tender Board (ZNTB),
-while at the same time building up capacity in the procurement management units (PSUs) in
line ministries and Government agencies to allow for gradual decentralization o f public
procurement;
strengthen the role and capacity o f institutions responsible for public expenditure oversight
and accountability- namely the Office o f the Auditor General and the Parliament. Part o f this
reinforcement o f accountability will come through changes in the legal framework, as well as
implementation o f an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which
will improve reporting by linking together resource allocation, budget execution and
accounting for the M o F N P in pilot ministries at the central l e v e l (in Lusaka).

A Productive and Efficient Public Service
89.
Context. Zambia needs to improve the effectiveness o f i t s public service to reduce poverty, and
to create a conducive environment for private sector investment and growth. This will require a qualified
and motivated c i v i l service, a structure o f public service and institutional set up that i s well aligned with
front line service delivery, improved policy coordination and implementation, and an appropriately paced,
gradual decentralization o f services consistent with capacity building local governments.
90.
Issues and obstacles. Zambia faces several challenges in improving the productivity and
efficiency o f the civil service. First, lowpay has reduced the incentives for motivation and eflciency in
civil service, and has made i t difficult to retain qualified staff (who leave c i v i l service for alternative jobs
in the private sector, NGOs, etc). In 2000, the real wages o f various categories o f civil servants was less
than 20 percent o f their 1975 level. In large part, this reflects the reduced ability o f the Government to
pay adequate wages in the face o f a persistently contracting economy. However, the Government also
lacks a good payroll and establishment control system, with the result that i t has been unable to determine
accurately the numbers o f people it employs let alone develop and implement a pay system that would

- 26-

increase morale and retention. Increased wage compression has led to a system o f benefits that has made
the cash remuneration o f top public servants meaningless.
Second, in many cases, ministry structures and the management incentives in Zambia seem to
91.
work at odds with increased performance and service delivery. There i s thus a need to review the size and
structure o f the public service, and rationalize the public sector when appropriate, so that relevant
institutions and human resources can support effective service delivery. Such institutions must also have
clear strategic plans with clear objectives and performance standards to which they will be held
accountable.

92.
Third, sustainedpolitical commitment to economic policy decisions, their implementation, and
their coordination has often been lacking in Zambia. The lack o f regular monitoring and evaluation o f
key public sector programs and policies has significantly contributed to lack o f progress on service
delivery and poverty reduction. Reversing this will require the active involvement o f the Cabinet and
Parliament in the monitoring and evaluation of Government policies and programs. The reviews should
focus not just o n inputs but also more importantly o n outputs and outcomes in terms o f the actual delivery
o f public services and their impact on the lives o f the people o f Zambia.
93.
Finally, as the Government’s decentralization policy begins to be implemented to bring service
delivery closer to people, the Ministry of Local Government will need to play an increasing role in the
monitoring and evaluation o f programs and policy implementation. However, the capacity o f this
Ministry i s very weak at present, and would need to be strengthened over time.

94.

Bankprogram. The Bank program will again support the goal o f efficient and productive civil
service through a combination o f lending and AAA. The Public Sector Reform agenda centers on the
need to i n s t i l l a more productive and efficient public service. The means t o achieve this are creating a
more qualified and motivated civil service, developing a strategic management orientation in line
ministries, improving policy coordination and implementation, and lastly, strengthening local
government’s capacity to participate in the development process (see Table 7). The Bank will assist the
Government to:

Consolidate into base salary (and eliminating where necessary) existing allowances in order to be
able to provide greater incentive for key professional and technical positions. The Bank will also
support, in coordination with other donors, measures to improve the management o f the wage
bill, and the restructuring and rightsizing needed to bring the wage bill down t o a level that i s
affordable and sustainable; measures for salary enhancement and decompression that fits within
the budget envelope o f the Government; and measures to build performance incentives into the
pay awards system for civil servants.
Continue i t s program to develop strategic plans for line ministries with clear objectives and
performance standards for service delivery. As this i s implemented, one should expect to see a
greater share o f budget resources allocated to service delivery functions and more c i v i l servants in
line functions.
Strengthen i t s monitoring and evaluation o f public sector reform program through a system o f
quarterly Cabinet reviews o f the budget, PRSP, and TNDP, followed by a report t o Parliament on
the findings o f such reviews and proposed remedial actions.
Strengthen local govemment capacity and community-driven development. Through an IDF
grant, the Bank will support capacity building in the ministry. Continued funding o f Z A M S I F
will also help to promote community-driven development.

VI. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PROGRAM AND VEHICLES
FOR ASSISTANCE
C u r r e n t Scenario and Prospects f o r the Way F o r w a r d
Zambia i s concluding the 1999-03 CAS period in a l o w case scenario, which becomes the
95.
departure platform - the new l o w case - for the coming four years. The disappointing results in
implementing the reform agenda and repeated delays in achieving macroeconomic stability call for an
assistance package that starts out with modest lending and i s more realistic than previous CASs with
regard to implementation capacity and the Govemment’s ability to maintain a macroeconomic framework
that i s supported by an IMF program. Under the l o w case, an IDA resource envelope o f between
USD$45-60 m i l l i o n p.a. for the next four years reflects the lagging performance, doubts about
Government commitment to and ownership o f the development agenda, and the weak governance
structure and public sector capacity.

96.
The l o w case scenario could revert to a scenario more typical for a LICUS country if the
Government i s unable to maintain a macroeconomic environment that i s supported by a PRGF. In such a
situation, the resource transfer will be modest and the focus will solely be on strengthening the analytical
and knowledge base. The Bank’s AAA, which guide the policy dialogue, will need to be stepped up to
provide the Government as w e l l as the aid partnership with in-depth analytical guidance and inform the
development dialogue that has expanded to include civil society, labor unions, academia, donors, NGOs,
and I F I s .
L e n d i n g Scenarios and Triggers
Starting from the l o w case o f the last CAS o f about US$65 million in IDA commitments per year
97.
(actuals for FY02/03 were U S 1 3 2 million in total) the proposed resource envelope under the new l o w
case scenario i s US$180-240 m i l l i o n for the period FY04-07. The next higher level, the base case
scenario, would result in US$70-80 million p.a., or between US$280-320 m i l l i o n in total which would
exhaust the current IDA allocation, which i s SDR230 million for FY04-07. In case that Zambia’s
performance i s sustained and even accelerated with regard to macroeconomic and structural reforms, and
PRSP implementation, the new high case would call for exceptional allocation o f IDA resources during
the 2004-2007 CAS period and would be between US$90-105 million p.a. or US$360-420 million in total
which would be a 30 percent increase over the current IDA envelope (Figure 5).

In view o f a constrained IDA envelope - on account o f weak policy performance - the main
98.
challenge o f this CAS i s to reach selectivity among the far-reaching and competing needs to reduce
poverty in Zambia. This CAS proposes to achieve selectivity in a variety o f ways:
0

0

0

First, through much more realistic and, as compared to previous CASs, more modest lending
scenarios.
Second, through phasing out projects in the existing portfolio where the Bank does not have a
comparative advantage in Zambia or where other partners are active, e.g. railways, support to
legal and judicial reform.
Third, focus on support to the public enterprise sector only if warranted by irreversible
progress on commercializatiodprivatization and implementation o f a regulatory environment
that enables competition.

Fourth, focus on support to the financial sector only i f warranted by irreversible progress in
the reforms and restructuring/commercialization/privatizationo f loss malung and/or
redundant public financial institutions.
Fifth, explicit recognition o f need for safety nets and protection o f the vulnerable in the l o w
case scenario, which i s characterized by an unfavorable macroeconomic environment.
Lastly, through well-targeted and sequenced AAA interventions, to lay the foundation for
future lending.

Triggers for the lending scenarios will first and foremost focus o n progress in the areas o f
macroeconomic stabilization, economic governance, and accountability and transparency o f public sector
management (see Table 8). Particular attention will be given to weaknesses identified in the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), e.g. macroeconomic and public expenditure management.
Second, following progress o n governance and public sector management, one would expect to see
progress on regulatory reforms and delivery o f basic services. Third, overall progress in implementation
o f the PRSP/TNDP measures would be linked to the three lending scenarios. Fourth, the various lending
scenarios would take into account implementation capacity and follow-through on portfolio management
issues as reflected by portfolio quality indicators. Over the C A S period, Zambia i s likely to move
between scenarios, especially if the o d o f f cycle with regard to the IMF program continues.8

100. Low case scenario. The l o w case scenario i s the only relevant scenario for the remainder o f
FY04. For FY05 and beyond, even to stay in the l o w case requires a stable macroeconomic environment
supported by an IMF support program. If such agreement i s not reached in a timely manner, Zambia’s
economy could fall into a downward spiral with accumulation o f external arrears, which could preclude
new IDA lending.
However, if Zambia’s CPIA indicators would substantially improve and the country would quickly reach the high
case scenario with IDA allocations being significantly above current levels, a CAS update or a new CAS would be
prepared to reflect such a situation.

- 29-

10 1. The l o w case scenario assumes that progress on implementation o f structural reforms in the area
o f accountability, public finance management, and regulatory reforms i s slow and delayed because o f
wavering Government commitment. Although the Government might continue to implement i t s program
of zero tolerance for corruption, it will be slow in dealing with loss-making public enterprises and even
commercialization will not proceed as smoothly as planned. Implementation o f the current portfolio
continues t o be poor and reach unsatisfactory levels o f 20 percent and more and implementation o f
remedial actions (including those agreed during the June 2003 CPPR) i s slow.

The l o w case lending scenario aims to safeguard services to the poor andor build o n successful
102.
projects where implementation risks are acceptable. Assuming that some degree o f macroeconomic
stability i s achieved and sustained, the Bank lending pipeline would comprise between one and two
operations per year (see Table 9). In addition t o the absence o f adjustment lending, the Bank’s support

- 30-

would either: (i)
be more phased and at reduced levels in areas where agreements o n regulatory reforms i s
slow and delayed (e.g., Support to Water Sector Reform); or (ii)
deferred until the overall environment
and Government commitment, ownership, and capacity i s substantially improved (e.g., Support to
Financial Sector Reforms; Increased Access to Electricity, and Support to Decentralization). In this case,
the Bank would focus on:

I. The Bank’s new lending in support o f economic diversijkation and trade for private sector
growth would be centered around infrastructure.
0
Building on the solid track record o f ROADSIP, the follow-on Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project (RRMP) would be implemented to protect the stock o f roads and
maintain acceptable road infrastructure.
0

The Support to Economic Expansion and Diversification Project (SEED) would rely on wellspecified projects in selected sub-sectors (gemstones, tourism, and selected agnbusiness) that
would have good prospects for success even without a growth conducive macroeconomic
environment.
The Agricultural Development Support Program would support the Government’s effort to
jumpstart agriculture-led rural growth and income generation.

Within the regional context, Zambia’s central role in the Southern African Power Pool
(SAPP) will be supported.

11. The Government’s Public Sector Reform program would be supported through the Public Sector
Management Support Program (building on the analytical basis o f PEMFAR) where the donor
community would work together and pool funds and which would aim at achieving greater
accountability and transparency in budget management and gaining control over public service
payroll and staffing.
111. The biggest impact with regard to human development i s expected from the existing Bank
portfolio, there would be some new IDA lending in the outer years o f the C A S t o ensure
continuity o f Bank commitment to the sectors.
The focus would be to move towards sector-wide approaches and coordinate design,
preparation and implementation o f interventions with all stakeholders under the leadership o f
the Government. The Bank would continue i t s support in the education sector through the
Education SWAP and Health SWAP. The Water Sector Reform Project would build on the
satisfactory progress under the M i n e Township Services Project.

In a situation of continued macroeconomic volatility and recurrent drought, social safety nets
and mitigating measures will be critical elements in new lending operations. M o r e
specifically, both the forthcoming Education and Health Sector Support Programs would
include targeted activities to benefit OVPs (for instance supplementary feeding and school
feeding programs). B o t h operations would be implemented within the context o f strong aid
coordination and Bank support would leverage other donors’ assistance. The Agricultural
Support Program would support risk mitigating measures resulting f r o m recurring drought.
Within the subregional context and to address the cross-border issue o f HIV/AIDS, an
H I V / A I D S Corridor Project i s envisaged to complement the ongoing ZANARA operation.

Ongoing support will be provided t o the Government-driven PRSP process with Joint
Staff Assessment to accompany the Progress Reports due annually and a new PRSP
planned for FY06. O f particular focus would be the functioning o f an appropriate M&E
system to gauge progress on the PRSP and TNDP agenda.

In this context, the policy dialogue on public finance management and public sector
management will be grounded in the recently completed FY03 PEMFAR and be followed
up with PEMFAR type reports that cover requirements o f PER, CPAR and C F A A in
FY06. In addition, the HIPC-AAP (FY04 and FY06) document, prepared in partnership
with the IMF, will allow for an evaluation o f progress in this area, while the Governance
Survev o f F Y 0 4 can assist the Government in i t s effort to fight corruption.

With regard to macroeconomic stabilization, growth, and diversification, the analytical
base for the Bank’s policy dialogue i s the FY03 Diversification Study and the F Y 0 4
Country Economic Memorandum to be repeated in FY07. Further, advice and support to
help the Government address the mounting domestic debt problem will be provided o n
the basis o f a Debt and Cash Management Assessment in FY05 that includes contingent
liabilities and arrears in the SOE sector. In the area o f economic analysis, Zambia would
need to review i t s current labor laws, pertaining to the civil service as well as for business
and investment climate. Therefore a Review o f Labor Market Regulations i s foreseen in
FY05. T o assist the Government in the area o f trade, an Integrated Framework study
with the Bank’s trade partners i s planned for FY05.
T o update the knowledge base on poverty and vulnerability the AAA program includes a
F Y 0 5 Poverty and Vulnerabilitv Assessment (carried out in close coordination with
donors and c i v i l society), which builds on the F Y 0 4 Social Safety Nets and Social
Protection Strategy Note. Further, with support from the HD network, the Strategic
Countrv Gender Assessment will help mainstream gender and women’s issues in the
w o r k program.

With support fi-om central units in the Bank, we will build up the knowledge and provide
analytical guidance in the broad area o f regulatory and private sector policy reform
through the F Y 0 4 Investment Climate Assessment and FIAS’ Administrative Barriers
Study. With support from COCPO, the Bank will continue to help the Government
tackle the post privatization issues in the copper sector and the analytical basis for our
policy dialogue will be grounded in the Post Privatization Copper Stratew, planned for
FY06. In the agricultural sector, a Rural Development Sector Strategy, possibly in
collaboration with E C and AfDB will be carried out in FY05 to explore policy and
institutional obstacles and possible solutions in this area. The Bank will support the
Government in identifying options and opportunities for public-private partnerships.
Specific AAA to help prepare the ground for future lending operations include the w o r k
o n Energy Services Delivery Options (FY04), and Education and Health Sector PERs are
planned for FY06.

Base Case. M o v i n g from the l o w case scenario to the base case scenario i s among others
premised on achievement o f macroeconomic stability reflected by conclusion o f an IMF PRGF plus
substantial progress towards HIPC completion and key governance issues (see Table 8). This would
include (i)
good progress i s being made in the areas o f economic govemance as reflected by continued
progress in implementing the Government’s public sector reform program i.e., an operational MTEF and
implementation o f I F M I S in three pilot ministries; (ii)
the Government moves ahead in a determined way
t o resolve the issues relating to loss-making public enterprises through liquidation and/or reorganization
in a sustainable manner and stay on track with ZESCO commercialization and Z A N A C O privatization;
and (iii)
implementation o f the current portfolio continues to be broadly satisfactory and remedial actions,
including those agreed during the June 2003 CPPR, are taken to maintain a portfolio rating o f less than
15-20 percent unsatisfactory and disbursement ratio o f 20 percent p.a.
The base case includes adiustment lending to support macroeconomic stabilization in parallel
105.
with the PRGF and other donors’ policy-based support (see Table 9). The f i r s t such operation are to be
prepared in parallel with the current IMF plans to conclude the PRGF by mid-2004 and would be a
traditional adjustment operation. These macroeconomic support operations would depend on upfront
actions and results, and be the backbone o f support to policy and institutional reforms with regard to a
growth conducive macroeconomic environment and a diversified and export oriented economy and will
extensively draw on AAA (strategic priority 1). The earliest Zambia could reach the base case scenario i s
f r o m FY05 onward.
106.
Incomparison to the l o w case, the base case also allows the Bank to include the Increased Access
t o Electricitv Proiect (FY06) and Global Development Learning Network L E (FY05), bring forward to
F Y 0 6 the Education SWAU, and expand the scope o f Health SWAP. The Global Development Learning
Network LIL would help enable decision makers and mid-level professionals and practitioners to access
and share the global knowledge and apply i t in the Zambian context. Overall, the Bank lending program
would comprise up to three operations per year.

The AAA program in the base case would undertake all the E S W as planned in the l o w case and
107.
will add three pieces o f E S W on account o f stronger Government ownership and commitment t o reforms.
This will be an I C T Options Study with support from CITPO in F Y 0 6 and a Competition Policy and
Regulatory Review in FY07. A study on Decentralization Implementation Options would be prepared in
FY06. The PER o f the Education Sector will be brought forward to FY05 to inform the SWAP in the
education sector n o w planned for F Y 0 6 instead o f FY07, as would the Post Privatization Copper Strategy.
High Case. M o v i n g f r o m the base case scenario would require a continuous commitment to
108.
improve the macroeconomic environment resulting in sustainable lower interest rates. Implementation o f
reforms aimed at improving accountability and transparency in the public sector are accelerated and
bearing fruit. Further, progress reports on the PRSP are consistently positive and progress on reducing
poverty i s evident in poverty indicators. The Govemment moves ahead in a determined way to bring
loss-making (infrastructural) public enterprises back to profitability. This progress i s sustained and
complemented by the adoption and implementation o f polices that foster competition in those sectors in
which the Government has maintained a dominant position. The implementation o f the current portfolio
i s strong and proactive remedial actions (including those agreed during the June 2003 CPPR) are
implemented to maintain a portfolio rating o f less than 15 percent unsatisfactory and disbursement ratio
o f more than 25 percent p.a. The earliest Zambia could reach the high case scenario i s f r o m F Y 0 6
onward. The Bank lending program would comprise up to 4 operations per year with scale-up o f some
operations above the planned base case level.
Under the high case, the Bank would increasingly move t o “programmatic support” by building
109.
o n the progress made in the area o f public sector management. The high case will include annual

- 34-

operations to support macroeconomic stabilization in parallel with the PRGF and other donors' policybased support (see Table 9). Given expected progress on the IFMIS, MTEF and overall public finance
management, as w e l l as the ability to monitor and evaluate sector outcomes in education and health;
future operations would be o f the PRSC type and will have a specific sectoral focus (FY06-Education and
FYO7-Health). Therefore, these adjustment operations would support policy reforms not only in the area
o f strategic priority one, but also o f strategic priority two. In addition, the Bank would increasingly work
through partnerships in particular in sectors where freestanding operations would be phased out because
(i)
either other donors would close the financing gap, or (ii)
Bank financial resources would be channeled
through PRSC type operations. The implications for administrative budget allocations would be that
policy dialogue i s funded on equal terms with lending operations.

110.
In comparison to the base case, the high case scenario would allow the Bank to include the
following projects into i t s portfolio: A Financial Sector Reform Credit would follow on to the recently
completed Enterprise Development Project and support the implementation o f recommendations resulting
f r o m the FY03 FSAP in FY06. Under the assumption that good progress i s being made at the central
government level with regard to public finance management and macroeconomic consolidation, the Bank
could support the next phase o f Decentralization o f Public Service Delivery in FY07, as a follow-up to
ZAMSIF, based o n strong ownership, and preparation of a detailed and credible Government strategy.
The Bank would increase the scope o f the Agriculture Support Proiect and the Increased Access to
Electricitv Proiect. The AAA program in the high case scenario i s n o different from the base case.

Partnerships and Harmonization

111. Donor coordination. Donor support for Zambia i s aligned with the priority areas o f the PRSP.
Good progress for strengthening donor coordination has been made in the past year. After the last
Consultative Group (CG) meeting in July 2002, in Zambia, a new coordination mechanism was agreed
between Government and cooperating partners. The main feature o f the new arrangement was that
Government would take the lead at both macro and sector levels, and would take PRSP/TNDP
implementation as the starting point. There would be quarterly meetings o f heads o f mission, chaired by
the Minister o f Finance, to address policy and overall resource mobilization issues. Sectoral and thematic
groups, corresponding to those which prepared the PRSP, would address technical coordination issues,
and would be chaired by permanent secretaries from line ministries. The new mechanism has yet to
perform as expected. Ministerial level meetings have, until very recently, lacked a clear purpose and
agenda, while only in education and health, where there are SWAps, have the ministries been exercising
effective leadership. T o support this new process, and under the Bank initiated donor coordination
review, a steering group chaired by a Deputy Minister o f Finance and National Planning, comprising the
UN Resident Coordinator, and representatives o f Norway, Sweden, the UK and the Bank, has developed
proposals to strengthen the arrangements agreed in 2002, and, at the same time ensure donor coordination
in alignment with the PRSPITNDP. These proposals focus o n strengthening the capacity o f the
Government to manage donor coordination in consonance with key processes, like the PRSP/TNDP and
Zambia’s Medium Term Expenditure Framework.
112.
The recently published PEMFAR document, the preparation o f which saw substantive
consultations with the donor community at all stages, and has l e d to a new pattern of, and improved
climate for donor coordination and i s a good example o f this intensified approach. At the Governmentinitiated meeting o n i t s public sector reform strategy, progress was made in developing a consensus on
reform priorities as identified in the PEMFAR document among Government and donors. Institutional
arrangements for carrying the process forward were agreed upon and agreement in principle was reached
on pooled funding. Currently, the donors and the Government are working o n an implementation plan for
these proposed reforms. In addition, the Government presented publicly, for the first time, a multi-year
outlook o f i t s budget in September 2003. Partners, along with other stakeholders, were asked t o
comment. At that time the Government announced i t s intention to use a MTEF as a tool to improve the
dialogue between the Government and cooperating partners and for a more meaningful matching o f needs
and support.

113. Harmonization in Practice (HIP)). Harmonization i s a critical issue for donor coordination. In
M a r c h 2003, the HIP Initiative was officially launched by a Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU)
signed with the Government. The Initiative aims to enhance aid effectiveness, particularly through the
harmonization o f procedures, and turn the spotlight onto key issues for Government and i t s partners. A
HIP Secretariat within the Economic and Technical Cooperation Department o f M o F N P has been
established to help achieve this goal. The HIP Action Plan identified five crosscutting issues which need
more attention: an overall aid policy or strategy for Zambia; budget support and SWAps; monitoring and
reporting; human resources and technical cooperation; and information management. The Bank i s in
facto part o f the H I P group. In fact the HIP group i s now being widened to further harmonize donor
coordination and procedures under the umbrella o f a proposed Harmonization Working Group (HWG).
In fact the HWG will include the HIP signatories, the EC, the Bank, and other non-HIP donors.
114.
Implications for the Bank. The Bank has always played a leading role in donor coordination in
Zambia, both at the level o f the CG, and in key sector programs, most notably the SWAps in education
In Zambia, H I P donors are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

- 36-

and health, ROADSIP, and A S P . With the PRSP and the MTEF emerging as Government instruments
for poverty reduction, the need for closer alignment o f requirements and assistance i s greater, as i s the
need for innovation in the instruments o f coordination and harmonization. Specifically, through this C A S
(i)
the Bank i s adjusting the sectoral balance o f i t s program to reflect both the PRSP and partners'
programs; (ii)
the Bank i s intensifying i t s cooperation with partners through programmatic instruments
and AAA, with the long-term a i m o f part o f i t s assistance going through a PRSC (if and when conditions
permit), (iii)
the Bank i s joining the HIP and i s working closely with non-HIP donors to increase
harmonization and t o raise the profile o f collaboration in Bank operations; and (iv) since such cooperation
cannot occur without a strong presence at country level, further decentralization t o the Country Office i s
envisaged.

Consultation During the CAS Period

115.
T o validate the C A S results framework, a program o f in-country consultations o n the draft C A S
was undertaken f r o m November 2003 to January 2004. Those consulted included the Government,
members o f parliament, donor community representatives, c i v i l society (non-governmental organizations,
professional associations, and academia), the private sector, and two provinces (North-Western Province
and Copperbelt - in both cases with a cross-section o f stakeholders). The main objective o f the CAS
consultations was t o find out f r o m the various stakeholders whether: (i)
the C A S diagnosis o f the current
development challenges facing Zambia was accurate; (ii)
the CAS strategic pillars were sufficiently
aligned with the Zambia PRSP/TNDP; (iii)
the Bank's proposed areas o f focus and support were
appropriate; (iv) the realism o f the triggers to move Zambia from i t s current l o w case to the base and
possibly high case; and (v) continue the process o f partnerships and dialogue with various stakeholders to
agree o n performance targets to which all parties are mutually held accountable.
116. Overall, the draft C A S got a positive review and the stakeholders emphasized the importance of:
(a) the need to break with the past and that business as usual i s not an option; (b) public service reform
(especially improving policy implementation capacity, public expenditure management, accountability
and service delivery); (c) the Bank and other donors not just focusing on poverty reduction but wealth
creation through growth as well as focusing o n those sectors and/or activities that have a large poverty
reducing impact such as agriculture and infrastructure development; (d) the speedy restoration o f the
PRGF to unlock external support and reach the HIPC Completion Point; and (e) for the Bank to remain
engaged in the consultations and dialogue process even after the C A S has been discussed by the Bank's
Board and i t s implementation has started.

In the context o f the consultation with the donor community o n this CAS, i t was agreed that:

stronger efforts were needed to ensure alignment o f donor programs t o the PRSP, and also
planning and budgeting cycles with the PRSP, with a possible aim for common donor support for
the 2005-2007 PRSP;
the CDF matrix be updated to clarify activities carried out by partners t o provide the analytical
basis for the needed realignment o f the new PRSP and identification o f comparative advantage;"
other partners (foundations, global funds, international and local NGOs, and the private sector)
need to be made part o f this analysis and the dialogue.

loIn the medium term, and particularly for the next PRSP, the CDF matrix should b e updated t o reflect not only the
sectoral pattern but also the instruments o f donor support (budget support, pooled funding, and stand-alone projects
and programs).

- 37-

118. Annual Consultations on CAS Progress. T o further strengthen partnerships with civil society,
private sector, and other stakeholders in Zambia, i t was agreed that formal consultations by the Bank’s
Country Office with civil society organizations and the private sector would take place during the CAS
period. These consultations will, inter alia, be used to review programs in the implementation o f the
CAS, as indicated above.
IFC
International Finance Corporation (IFC) i s very much aligned with the Bank’s policy agenda in
119.
Zambia. The IFC currently has a small portfolio o f 12 projects totaling U S S l 5 million outstanding.
These are a mix o f financial sector, agribusiness, telecommunications (mobile telephone), and tourism
projects. IFC’s most prominent recent project was for US$30 million in the equity o f Konkola Copper
M i n e s (KCM) with Anglo-American in 2000. I F C exited in 2002 along with Anglo, in accordance with
the terms o f the investment agreement. Other projects include US$4.6 million in Lusaka Intercontinental in 200 1. With the exception o f K C M , where I F C was repaid by Anglo, as well as IFC’s
cellular investment, portfolio performance has been poor. IFC has also expanded micro, small and
medium enterprise (MSME) programs, but has redirected those in the Copperbelt to support
diversification, rather than expanding linkages to mining, which had been i t s earlier focus.
Zambia i s currently a group 3 country for I F C (as defined in the recently board approved I F C
120.
strategic initiative for Afnca), and thus assessed as a relatively poor investment climate with limited
prospects for stimulating new private investment, and limited progress on reforms to improve the
investment climate. In this environment, I F C seeks to be responsive to individual projects where IFC can
play a role, and in which there i s strong development impact, but does not invest significant resources in
upstream project development. I F C explores where the infrastructure privatization advisory unit can add
value in designing and implementingprivate sector participation (PSP) strategies to achieve the key
efficiencies and remedy the typical backlog on investments. They explore advisory programs (currently
limited in Zambia), and make significant efforts with M S M E capacity building and technical assistance,
primarily through the Africa project development facility. Finally, I F C i s exploring jointly with the Bank
h o w to support the Bank Group’s activities on improving the investment climate in Zambia.
I F C i s aware o f continuing private investment in agnbusiness, in particular commercial farming
12 1.
and horticulture for export. I F C has held discussions with a number o f sponsors in these sectors,
however, for the moment, no projects have materialized. IFC i s ready to expand i t s activity in Zambia if
significant progress i s made on the policy agenda.

MIGA

MIGA has not received any portion o f Zambia’s contribution toward the General Capital
122.
Increase. Zambia’s share i s US$2,618,440, o f which US$462,155 i s payable in cash. MIGA’s
outstanding portfolio in Zambia consists o f four contracts o f guarantee in the agribusiness and
manufacturing services sector with a US$36.1 million gross exposure and a US$35.7 million net
exposure. The projects are for the privatization, modernization, and expansion o f a foundry, and for
cobalt and copper facilities. They benefit the Zambian economy by saving production costs and by
providing training to personnel working on projects. The estimated total amount o f foreign direct
investment facilitated to date i s US$155.5 million. Currently, MIGA i s underwriting a project in the
infrastructure sector, with expected coverage o f US$20 million, which i s expected to be signed in FY04.

VII. MONITORING AND EVALUATION WITHIN A RESULTS-BASED
FRAMEWORK
123.
An appropriate M&E system capable o f assessing progress toward C A S goals i s important to
i n f o r m Govemment and the Bank on what i s and i s not working, and thereby promotes accountability at
the country level as well as within the Bank.

Moving from inputs to outcomes. Monitoring and evaluation efforts in Zambia, as in many other
124.
countries, have focused more on monitoring administrative procedures and spending (inputs) and less o n
measuring outputs, outcomes, and evaluating the impacts o f programs and policies. Moreover, existing
systems are weak: the link between spending and outcomes i s unclear, reporting i s uneven, and the
accountability mechanisms that do exist function poorly. Zambia faces a number o f challenges in
ensuring that timely and credible information i s collected, and that the information i s used to inform and
support the design o f policies and programs, as well as monitor their implementation. Results-based
M&E has two important objectives: to promote public accountability and to support informed decisionmaking by policy makers and political leaders. The information used by policy makers to monitor and
evaluate progress e.g. at implementing the PRSP/TNDP must be made available to the wider public and
thus foster informed public debate.
Implementing a PRSP M&E system is key. Although significant attention has been paid by the
125.
donor community and c i v i l society to design a useful M&E system (see B o x 4) to assess progress towards
the PRSP/TNDP goals, l i t t l e advancement has been made in this area. At this time there i s a proposal
under review for a poverty monitoring and analysis system (PMA) that involves significant roles for both
the Ministry o f Finance and National Planning and the National Statistics Office. Each would have a role
in collecting and analyzing program and policy relevant data on the key performance indicators proposed
in the PRSP/TNDP. The proposal also indicates a role for sub-national government in the
implementation o f the M&E system. However, n o final concurrence has been made o n the final design o f
this system. This presents a potential problem to being able to successfully monitor and evaluate progress
o f the C A S outcomes. I t will be important to align the CAS monitoring system to the PRSP/TNDP
system as much as possible to minimize if not prevent the need for parallel M&E fkameworks. The Bank
i s committed to work with the Government o n these issues.

126.
The role of civil society. In additional t o participating at the request o f the Govemment in P M A
discussions for the PRSP/TNDP, C i v i l Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR), an umbrella organization
for NGOs involved in monitoring the implementation o f the PRSP, recently launched a participatory
monitoring exercise in some o f Zambia’s poorest and more backward areas. The aim o f this exercise i s to
assess progress with implementing the PRSP/TNDP as well as monitoring actual disbursement and use o f
H I P C funds in poor rural communities.” While their early findings indicate some progress at sectoral
levels, e.g. enhanced food security in some regions, improvements in delivery o f health services, the
challenges remain large and there was little evidence that the PRSP/TNDP process and priorities were
understood at the local level.

127. Internal M&Eprocesses. The Bank’s CPPR will be aligned with the results framework: it will
assess progress in achieving CAS outputs/outcomes, evaluate r i s k s that may hinder achievement o f
desired results, and identify any systemic issues that could affect the portfolio. A mid-term Country
Program Review will be prepared to evaluate whether CAS outcomes are actually being achieved, and, in
light o f these findings, to determine whether there i s a need to make mid-course adjustments e.g. due to
changing country conditions. A completion report will be prepared at the end o f the four-year CAS cycle;
it will assess progress at achieving specific C A S results and see whether these have indeed contributed to
Zambia’s longer-term strategic objectives. The completion report will be instrumental in designing the
next CAS, whilst progress i s measured-and discussed-on a frequent and regular basis.

128.
Theflnalgoal: managing for results. While specific AAA and lending operations have been
planned against the outcomes identified in the results matrix, the C A S will remain a dynamic and flexible
tool; resources will be redirected in response to changing country conditions and the results matrices will
be revised accordingly. The mid-termreview i s an important step in ensuring that the C A S i s properly
aligned in support o f Zambia’s strategic objectives. The Government will begin preparation o f i t s next
PRSP in 2005; if this proceeds as planned, the mid-termreview will provide an opportunity to re-align the
CAS with any new PRSP priorities. In addition, the Bank will continue to support Zambia in improving
accountability and management for results. For example, the third pillar (Promoting an Efficient and
Effectively Managed Public Sector) i s explicitly aimed at improving capacity in Government for
expenditure management and better service delivery.

- 40-

VIII. COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT
129.
Political risks. The ongoing controversy between the ruling party and the opposition over the
Presidential election results, the appointment and the terms o f reference o f the Constitution Review
Commission, the confrontation with unions over the re-negotiation o f the 2003 collective agreement all
distract the Government from the development agenda set out in the PRSPITNDP. In addition, the above
issues do not help Zambia to market i t s e l f as a stable, attractive place for investment. In these
circumstances, the Bank will help the Govemment stay focused o n the poverty reduction agenda through
continuous dialogue, close coordination with other donors, and emphasis o n political stability.
130.
Governance risks. The current hostile political climate might lead to “short-termism”, focused
o n the survival o f the Govemment, and could displace the poverty reduction agenda as a priority. With
this in mind, the Bank’s assistance, including policy dialogue, would continue to emphasize zero
tolerance o f corruption and the strengthening o f the institutions charged with the responsibility o f
ensuring transparency and accountability in public affairs and focus on poverty reduction.
13 1.
Macroeconomic instability. The Zambian economy i s once again balanced on a knife-edge
because i t i s beset by external repayments for which it hardly has the resources. Attempts to muddle
through would not do. Rather, tough political decisions are needed to address the macro imbalances and
prevent their recurrence. If the Government demonstrates firm leadership in tackling the imbalances, the
Bank would work closely with other donors and the IMF to mobilize the resources needed to support
Zambia’s efforts t o achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability.
132.
Copper. Recent months have seen considerable increases in copper prices. On a year-to-year
basis, copper prices swung from U S 0 . 7 2 per pound at the close o f 2002 to US$1.02 per pound at the
close o f 2003, posing an appreciation o f 30 cents per pound. This has contributed to a 6 percent increase
in Zambia’s terms o f trade in 2003. This may re-ignite the hope that one can rely once again o n the
copper sector for fiscal revenues and therefore delay the sale o f K C M and diminish i t s efforts to facilitate
a diversification o f Zambia’s economy away from copper. Such actions would harm Zambia’s ability to
achieve i t s long-term objectives o f sustainable economic diversification as outlined in Zambia’s
PRSPITNDP. The Bank will continue to emphasize that business as usual i s not an option through i t s
lending, in particular i t s adjustment operations and through i t s analytical work.
133,
Regional turmoil. Progress i s being made towards bringing peace to the Democratic Republic o f
the Congo (DRC) but the turmoil in that country i s far from over. Were durable peace to take h o l d in the
DRC, Zambia would reap a number of benefits, including reduced influx o f refugees and the opening up
o f markets for Zambian goods. If
the present peace efforts collapse and the war intensifies, Zambia
would have to brace itself for more refugees. Another potential area o f turmoil in the region i s Zimbabwe
whose economy has collapsed. Were economic collapse to trigger political and c i v i l upheaval in
Zimbabwe, Zambia would bear some of the brunt o f the negative fall-out in the form o f refugees and the
general bad international publicity that such events normally generate. The Bank, through i t s support to
SADC and NEPAD will support the political stabilization process in the region
134.
Continuing HIV/AIDSpandemic. Zambia i s entering i t s third decade o f double-digit prevalence
o f HIV/AIDS, and the impacts o f the disease are visible in all spheres o f the economy, as well as the
wider society. The potential r i s k s to Zambia’s future are enormous. The Bank will support efforts to
stem the spread o f the infection and improve the quality o f l i f e for those living with H I V / A I D S through
its analytic work, policy dialogue, and project support, including ZANARA as well as other Operations,
e.g. in service delivery and support for vulnerable groups.

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS
The next four years will be a critical window o f opportunity for Zambia. Business as usual will
135.
not be sufficient t o put the country on a path o f sustainable development towards reaching the MDGs.
Instead, what i s required i s a comprehensive change-management effort that will focus o n enhancing
accountability o f the public sector, strengthen follow-through on structural measures, and reflect strong
leadership and commitment at the political level so as to give back to the people a higher degree o f
confidence in the future o f the economy. This also entails a change in the way the Bank i s doing business
in Zambia. First, it requires a better focus on those areas where we have a comparative advantage and
where our interventions are likely to show tangible results over the next four years. Second, we will need
to better align our support vehicles: projects, partnerships, and policy advice. Third, we will work more
closely with our partners to capitalize on synergy from our individual interventions. Fourth, our policy
advice will focus on the accelerated implementation o f the governance agenda, support private sector
development, and help improve public finance management so that Zambia takes full advantage o f
benefits from the enhanced HIPC initiative to improve the quality o f l i f e o f i t s people.

Mining has been an important generator o f economic activity in Zambia throughout
the twentieth century. Although, Zambia i s endowed with precious metals, gemstones, and
agro-industrial minerals, the mining sector i s dominated by copper mining. The exports o f
mineral products, mainly copper, s t i l l contribute about 70% o f the country’s foreign exchange
earnings. The large copper deposits have not only contributed to Zambia’s dependency on copper
as an economic activity but have led also to a high degree o f urbanization as many original rural
dwellers came to the ‘Copperbelt’ to find a better livelihood.
Economic development has been dominated by the decline in copper production and
a secular decline in the purchasing power of Zambia’s copper resources, which have l e d to a
corresponding decline in per capita income (Error! Reference source not found.). The situation
has been further aggravated by frequent occurrences o f drought, the Government’s inability to
effectively manage those episodes o f misfortune, and the H I V / A I D S pandemic. In addition, the
high degree o f urbanization and decline in supply as well as general economic activity in the
Copperbelt have led to a high degree o f urban unemployment, which i s significantly different
from rural unemployment. This has led to a decline in per capita income from an all time high o f
US$752 in 1965 to US$351 in 2002.

Over the period 1965-2002, the mining sector contributed an average of 17 percent
o f GDP (more in early years and less in later years). Copper production declined by an
average annual rate o f about 3.5 percent, and copper price declined by an average annual rate o f
about 3.4 percent (although there was a stretch in the mid-1990s when the price o f copper was
significantly above the long-term trend). In the 1990s, the decline in the mining sector was even
greater than this long-term trend: 5.1 percent per annum. However, with the privatization o f
Z C C M in March 2000, the decline was reversed and the sector has, for the first time in over three
decades, grown at an average rate o f 2.1 percent per year since 1999. Today, the mining sector
contributes between 6 percent and 9 percent o f Zambia’s GDP and accounts for about 10 percent
o f formal sector employment. Most o f the mining sector, and i t s fluctuations, reflect the
performance o f copper mining.

The delay in the privatization o f ZCCM-a process initiated in the summer o f 1996
and completed only in early 2000-was costly to the Zambian economy. First, the long span
over which the privatization transactions were completed was marked by wide swings in the
- 79 -

world price o f copper. The delay, coupled with such price fluctuations, adversely affected the
eventual price that the Government could secure for privatization. Second, the delay in
privatization prolonged the period o f uncertainty during which the Z C C M assets deteriorated,
resulting in greater need for more costly rehabilitation when the new owners took over. Third,
production declined, leading to a decrease in the demand for goods and services fkom the
suppliers. M a n y o f the suppliers o f goods and services, especially those that have been in
operation for about five years or longer were adversely affected by ZCCM’s severe arrears
problems, and greater vulnerability to market forces, particularly in periods o f slowdown. Finally,
the delay also caused disruptions in the donor support, thus having a strong negative multiplier
effect o n the economic performance o f the country.
I n recent years, Zambia’s copper industry has become decidedly less cost
competitive. About one-half o f world copper production i s undertaken at or below the cost o f
US$ 0.30 and US$0.45/1b, but Zambia’s cost stands higher at US$0.58/lb (World Bank, Zambia
Competitiveness Report 2002). There are several contributing factors to this. First, the
proportion o f copper ore that i s high in grade and i s easily accessible from all the former ZCCM’s
mining operations has decreased significantly. Second, and probably more importantly, the long
neglect in terms o f investment in the company-which started in the 1980s and continued for
over two decades until i t s privatization in 2000-made i t difficult to improve productivity and cut
costs, The latter took place at a time when copper producers in other countries, for example
Chile, were opening vast new mines and investing in new and improved technology to cut costs
significantly.
Zambia’s copper industry will continue to suffer from its higher relative costs and
declining world prices. The severe drop in world copper price, the rising costs o f production,
and the inability o f the sector to quickly adjust to changing circumstances exacerbate the
problems o f privatized companies. The total output o f copper will certainly fall sharply, by about
100,000 tons per year around 2004 because o f the closure o f the Nchanga open pit when i t r u n s
out of ore. The development o f the Zambian copper industry beyond 2004 depends upon the
future outlook for the price o f copper, the evolution o f w o r l d copper production and consumption,
and Zambia’s ability to attract new investments to modernize ongoing mining operations and
open additional new mining pits.
Recent projections of world demand for copper indicate an increase by only about 2
percent a year for the next few years, but the long-term trend in the real price of copper i s
expected to continue to be declining by about 2 percent per year. This underlines the central
challenge to copper producers: the need to continue to reduce costs in order to remain in business.
For the Zambian Government, the challenge i s to realize that copper mining-Zambia’s
mainstream economic activity for the last several decades-is not the future o f Zambia, and that
there i s a need to develop plans and strategies to diversify the economy and reduce dependence
on copper. Although a long-term goal, that effort at diversification should start now.
I n the short- and medium-term, despite the difficulties it has gone through in recent
years, the copper industry will likely remain an important factor in Zambia’s economy.
The development o f the Zambian copper industry beyond 2004 depends upon Zambia’s ability to
attract new investment. Privately-owned by a consortium o f foreign investors led by the AngloAmerican Corporation (AAC), the mines were privatized and substantially re-capitalized in 2000.
Copper output growth in 2001-02 averaged 15 percent per annum. In August 2002, however, the
A A C withdrew from the copper sector in Zambia, after suffering substantial financial losses and
having failed to raise funds for the development o f the Konkola Deep Mining Project. Since the
withdrawal o f AAC, the Government has been searching for a strategic partner to run Konkola

-80-

Copper M i n e s (KCM) on a commercial basis. Future development will greatly depend o n whether
K C M would be successfully restructured as a going concern, and whether the Government would
be able to find a strategic partner to achieve that goal. So far the process o f finding a strategic
partner has been slow,l4 but medium term viability will critically depend on a successful
accomplishment o f this goal.
The development beyond 2004 also depends on the price o f copper, which in turn
depends on the evolution o f world copper production and consumption. Copper prices have,
for the last two years, floated around US$0.68 and U S 0 . 8 9 per pound. However, recent months
have seen considerable copper price recovery. On a year-to-year basis, copper prices swung from
US$0.72 per pound at the close o f 2002 to US$1.02 per pound at the close o f 2003, posing an
appreciation o f 30 cents per pound. This has in large part been due t o a stronger demand from
major buyers in Asia, especially China, and a production cut in Chile, the largest producer in the
world. T h i s may have already re-ignitedthe hope in Zambia that good performance o f copper
means all i s well. However, this i s unlikely to be the case, and the Government must stay focused
o n the longer term goal o f export diversification to reduce dependence on copper. In addition, in
the short-term, prudent management o f the foreign exchange earnings from price recovery will
remain critical.

l4T h e Government i s currently negotiating with Sterlite, an Indian Company, which i s expected to buy 52 per cent
shareholding in KCM. T h i s negotiation, if completed successfully, will allow Sterlite to inject substantial amount o f
money into strengthening the Zambian company.

Appendix 5: Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) - Informing the Pro-Poor Debate
T o help prioritize and understand potential distributional impacts o f Zambia’s PRSP
commitments, the Bank team jointly with Zambian researchers conducted Poverty and Social
Impact Analyses (PSIA) o f three key reforms in the area o f agriculture. This sector i s seen as an
engine for growth and poverty reduction in the PRSP given i t s overwhelming importance to the
livelihoods o f rural Zambians. The PSIA offers an analysis o f the social impacts in three areas
affecting agriculture and the rural economy: (i)
delivery o f rural infrastructure; (ii)
reduction/
restructuring o f fertilizer subsidy; and (iii)
rural land reform.
The findings and recommendations are a result o f stakeholder, institutional, risk, impact, and
scenario analyses. The PSIA analyzed positive and negative impacts, income and non-income
dimensions, as well as intended and unintended consequences on various groups. The analysis
also examined assumptions and causality from policy change, through implementation to impacts
and how institutions may affect or be affected by the reforms. The PSIA evaluated altematives
and outlined options to minimize risks and maximize positive impacts.
In respect to the three analyzed areas o f reform, the PSIA finds improved infrastructure and
laborsaving technologies to be a priority for poverty reduction. The importance o f improved
infrastructure, for example to provide access to markets for outputs as well as inputs, storage, and
information, cannot be over-emphasized. I t would lower the costs o f inputs; raise the relative
price o f tradable goods (such as hybrid maize, sunflower and cotton); open new land for
cultivation; and increase the value and use o f land. Improved infrastructure would also minimize
the need for smallholders to produce food for home consumption, and thus reduce the cost o f
making cropping decisions based on a “food security first” principle.

In the case o f fertilizer, despite subsidies the most vulnerable have had limited access to
fertilizers and those who have do not always use fertilizer in an economically rational manner.
Again, poor infrastructure affects the small and medium scale farmers adversely in t w o ways.
First, the transport costs and depots arrangements keep prices relatively high. Second, farmers’
access to markets and therefore to cash income i s limited. The limited access to markets keeps
many farmers in the non-cash economy, which perpetuates their vulnerability, poverty, and
exclusion. While efforts to improve the subsidy schemes have shown some positive results, they
s t i l l do not address these issues.
There are obvious inequities and inefficiencies in the current land distribution system.
Simplified and transparent procedures as well as improved capacity and efficiency o f the formal
land administration system are important steps to improving the current system. Similarly, better
and more secure property rights in the urban periphery will have major positive impact. Although
most rural lands are held under traditional tenure, the analysis showed that property rights do
exist, to the extent that land i s rented out and inherited without formal title. Scrapping the
traditional system would eliminate access to justice for most rural dwellers since the traditional
c h i e f s powers are linked to the land. Measures to improve the accountability o f the traditional
chiefs should be explored, since the main problems o f the existing system relate to exclusion and
gender discrimination. Improving land tenure by itself however will not reduce poverty. Lack o f
infrastructure i s a major constraint to using land, as i s the lack o f inputs, tools, and technology.

The PSIA’s conclusions show that a coordinated approach to rural development in Zambia i s
needed to pull the rural dwellers out o f their current subsistence farming activities. Land reform
by i t s e l f will do little to increase agricultural productivity. Productivity suffers from the lack o f
fertilizers, which in turn are hampered by the inadequate road network. These problems can be
solved, given sufficient resources and effort; but taken together they imply a substantial
transformation o f the infrastructure and the economic and social relations o f rural Zambia.

Appendix 6: Debt Sustainability Analysis
External debt

Zambia reached i t s decision point under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2000.
Application o f the H P C fi-amework indicated that Zambia’s debt needed to be reduced by
US$2,499 million in NPV terms (equivalent to a reduction o f 62.6 percent on the debt due and
outstanding as o f December 3 1, 1999), to reach the targeted NPV o f debt-to-export ratio o f 150
percent. Some creditors including the Paris Club, bilateral creditors and multilateral organizations
such as IDA, the IMF, the African Development Bank and the European Union, have begun
providing interim relief. IDA contributes to Zambia’s debt relief by lowering debt service
equivalent to US$60.7 million in NPV terms, which i s expected to amount to 84 percent o f debt
service falling due until the required NPV reduction i s achieved in 2020.
Updating the decision point DSA

This annex updates the debt sustainability analysis conducted at the decision point with
disbursement data obtained from the largest creditors, using the exchange and interest rate
parameters as o f end-2003 and updated export data. As o f end-2003, the NPV o f debt after
assuming the full delivery o f enhanced HIPC assistance would stand at US$2,232, compared with
US$2,135 projected for end-2003 in the decision point document. Lower-than-projected new
borrowing was more than compensated by the fall in the U.S dollar vis-a-vis the euro and the
pound sterling and a decline in discount rates.15 Zambia could reach i t s completion point at end2004, provided an IMF PRGF program i s put in place by mid-2004, a satisfactory 6-month
review i s completed by year-end and satisfactory progress i s made on remaining floating social
and structural completion point triggers.
Zambia’s NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio increased sharply from 150 percent at end-1999 to
an estimated 212.4 percent at end-2003. The increase results from actual new borrowing
undertaken fi-om decision point to end-2003 and the impact of lower discount rates and exchange
rates. An increase in the level o f exports over the 1999-03 period helped offset an otherwise
larger increase in the debt-to-exports ratio (see Table 1). N e w borrowing contributed 43.6
percentage points o f the total increase o f 62.4 percentage points, although as noted in the main
text o f the document this additional lending was mostly emergency drought-related lending.
Lower discount rates and the depreciating U S dollar vis-a-vis the euro and the pound sterling
explain a combined 19.5 percentage points o f the increase, while strong export growth fi-om the
decision point to end-2003 (average annual rate o f 10 percent) acted to offset somewhat (-0.7
percentage points) the increase in the NPV o f debt.
Only 11 percentage points o f the increase in the NPV o f debt-to-export ratio from
decision point to completion point was anticipated. The NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio was
projected to be 161 percent at end-2003 versus the 212.4 percent outtum. The export performance
between end-1999 and end-2003 was much weaker than expected at the decision point,
accounting for 40.5 percentage points o f the total 5 1.4 percentage points o f unanticipated
variation in the ratio. N e w borrowing was projected to be higher than the actual outcome over the
I s T h e appreciation o f the Euro and pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar raised the value o f outstanding loans vis-avis the U.S. dollar. However, this effect i s less pronounced in the case o f Zambia because the depreciation o f the
Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar was partially offsetting. Over 28% o f Zambia’s bi-lateral debt i s composed o f
Japanese Yen.

remaining impact due to the change in parameters between decision point and end-2003 was

CAS lending scenarios
Low case: Zambia i s concluding the 1999-03 C A S period in a l o w case scenario, which
will be the starting point for the new CAS period (FY 2004-07). Under the l o w case scenario,
IDA lending for FY 2004-07 i s projected to be between US$180-240 million or approximately
US$45-60 million per year. The l o w case scenario reflects the disappointing results in

implementing the reform agenda, declining CPIA indicators and weak public sector capacity
among others. Figure 1 shows that the NPV o f debt to exports ratio will drop below 150 percent
in 2005 (after assuming full delivery o f enhanced interim H I P C relief,), one year later than

being made in areas o f economic governance. Under the base case scenario, IDA lending for FY
2004-07 i s projected to be between US$280-320 m i l l i o n or approximately US$70-80 m i l l i o n per
year. The base case would include adjustment lending to support macroeconomic stabilization
and could be prepared in parallel with IMF plans t o conclude a PRGF by mid-2004. The NPV o f
debt-to-exports ratio does not reach 150 percent until 2006 under the base case scenario, two
years removed from decision point projections.

High case: M o v i n g from the base case to the high case lending scenario would require a
continuous commitment to improve the macroeconomic environment, the implementation o f
reforms aimed at improving accountability and transparency in the public sector, and consistently
positive progress reports on the PRSP. In this scenario IDA would increasingly move to
“programmatic support” by building o n the progress made in the area o f public sector
management and scale-up lending to infrastructure and the financial sector. Under the high case
lending scenario, IDA lending for FY 2004-07 i s projected to be between US$360-420 million or
approximately US$90-105 million per year. The NPV o f debt-to exports ratio reaches 148
percent in 2006 and falls to 112 percent at the end o f the projection period.

Long-term debt sustainability”
Assessing long-term debt sustainability in Zambia requires consideration o f a variety o f
indicators o f the debt stock or debt service relative t o various measures o f repayment capacity
such as GDP, exports, or government revenues. Under the base case scenario, Zambia’s NPV o f
” T h i s section i s based on the forthcoming joint IMFiIDA paper, ‘‘ Debt Sustainability in L o w Income Countries Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy Implications, February 2004.

- 85 -

debt-to-GDP ratio i s estimated to be 56.2 percent at end-2003, falling to 5 1.1 percent at end-2006.
The NPV o f debt-to-revenue ratio i s estimated to be 231.2 percent at end-2003, falling to 215.7
percent at end-2006. B o t h the debt service-to-exports ratio and the debt service-to-revenue
estimates indicate a sharp hump in payments in 2004 and 2005. The debt service hump i s due in
large part t o the expiration o f the grace period on principal payments o n PRGF/Structural
Adjustment Facility ( S A F ) loans related t o the clearance o f arrears to the IMF under the rights
accumulation program (RAP) in 1995. The debt service-to-export ratio rises to 14.6 percent in
2004 f r o m 11.8 percent in 2003 before falling to 5 percent in 2006. Similarly, the debt service-torevenue increases to 19.9 percent in 2004 from 14.7 percent in 2003 before falling to 8.6 percent
in 2006.
Determining if the above ratios signal sustainability o f Zambia’s debt burden i s extremely
difficult. Each o f the indicators has i t s merits and limitations in signaling potential debt servicing
interruptions, suggesting that they should be used in combination.” A growing body o f empirical
literature provides some guidance to assess h o w these indicators compare to thresholds o f debt
and/or debt service that are associated with a high probability o f debt distress or adverse growth
~ key result o f this literature i s that debt thresholds

should be established in light o f the quality o f a country’s policy’s and institutions, suggesting
that countries with stronger policies and institutions can sustain higher debt and debt service
ratios. On this basis and given Zambia’s struggle with accountability for public resources, the
failure to put in place a credible budget and generally weak economic governance, the end-2006
levels o f the debt-to-GDP ratio and the debt-to-revenue are cause for concern. Without an IMF
PRGF program in place in mid-2004 t o help address the debt servicing hump in 2004-05 the risk
of a liquidity problem appears high.
Another key result from this empirical debt sustainability literature i s that a country’s
susceptibility to shocks has a significant bearing on the debt levels it can sustain. Adverse
movements in key macroeconomic variables can undermine a country’s debt servicing capacity
and move debt ratios onto an explosive path. T h e variables that determine the vulnerability o f a
country’s debt outlook include the volatility o f i t s export eamings, output growth, and exchange
rate path, as well as fluctuations in non-debt financing, including both grants and foreign direct
investment.20 Zambia’s exports earnings are heavily dependant on copper and copper products.
The exports o f mineral products, mainly copper, contribute about 70 percent o f the country’s
foreign exchange earnings (see Appendix 4). With this heavy concentration on copper in export
earnings, Zambia i s susceptible to terms-of-trade shocks that will have a material impact on the
NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio. T o capture the sensitivity o f the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio to
lower export earnings Figure 2 shows the evolution o f the ratio assuming a historical growth rate
o f exports o f goods and services o f 4.3 percent (1992-02) relative to the base case export growth
scenario o f an average annual growth rate o f 9 percent2’ New borrowing remains at the levels
projected in the base case scenario, and IDA lending i s assumed to be at the base case level as
well. Under this scenario, in the absence o f any moves to constrain new borrowing, the NPV o f

debt-to-exports ratio does not fall below the 150 percent level for the entire projection period.
Were new borrowing t o be at levels expected in the l o w case scenario the ratio falls below 150
percent in 2007, but would remain close to 150 percent for the entire projection period.

This analysis has a number o f policy implications. F o r the Zambian authorities, as
emphasized in this CAS, a demonstrated commitment to improve policies and institutions by way
o f a continuation o f i t s program o f zero tolerance for corruption, a strengthening o f economic
governance and accountability, and greater transparency o f public sector management i s
necessary to support macroeconomic stability and improve the climate for entrepreneurship and
foreign investment. All o f which may positively impact long-term growth and thereby reduce the
probability o f debt distress. The authorities may further reduce the risk o f debt distress by
diversifying the export base away from copper and copper products as this C A S proposes t o
support through a combination o f lending and AAA. Moreover, a stronger capacity in debt
policy, monitoring and strategic debt management would allow a more systemic assessment o f
the impact o f new borrowing o n debt sustainability. Lastly, for the international community,
careful attention must be paid to the impact that new lending m a y have on the risk o f debt distress
in Zambia, which may require additional grants to prevent disruption t o the development program
without creating debt servicing problems in the future.”

Domestic debt
Zambia has accumulated significant domestic debt over the past few years to finance i t s
fiscal deficits, as budget support from foreign donors and multilaterals did not materialize. By
end-2003 domestic debt was equal to 21.8 percent o f GDP and interest payments on domestic

debt amounted to 3 percent o f GDP. External debt service i s estimated to be an additional 3.6
percent o f GDP at end-2003, further increasing the debt service burden and adding to the risk o f
debt distress. Overall debt sustainability hinges critically o n the Government’s ability to regain
control over i t s fiscal deficit and implement a macroeconomic framework that will lead to a
reduction in domestic interest rates and can be supported by an IMF program.
Conclusion
Zambia’s NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio i s estimated to have increased sharply from end1999 to end-2003. The increase was largely unanticipated according to decision point projections
and resulted from new borrowing, changes in the discount rate and the depreciation o f the U.S.
dollar vis-a-vis the euro and the pound sterling. Under both the high case and base case lending
scenarios in this CAS, the NPV o f debt-to exports ratio does not fall below 150 percent until 2006
compared to 2004 as predicted at decision point. Under the l o w case lending scenario, the ratio i s
estimated to fall below 150 percent in 2005. Zambia’s prospects for long-term debt sustainability
are hampered by weak economic govemance and a heavily reliance on copper and copper
products for export revenues. T o reduce the r i s k o f future debt distress the Zambian authorities
must improve economic governance and accountability in an effort encourage growth and
improve the climate for entrepreneurship and foreign investment. Diversifying the export base
and stronger debt management i s also necessary in this regard. The international community must
pay close attention to the impact that new lending may have on the risk o f debt distress in
Zambia.

Recent Economic Developments and Performance
U n d e r the Staff M o n i t o r e d P r o g r a m (SMP)

1.
A f t e r two decades o f persistent high inflation, stagnant economic growth, a n d
growing poverty, Zambia’s economic performance has i m p r o v e d m a r k e d l y since mid-2000.
Real GDP growth averaged about 4 percent during 2000-02, and inflation slowed to an average o f
about 24 percent. In 2003, growth i s estimated at 4.2 percent, while the 12-month inflation rate o f
17.2 percent through December 2003 i s the lowest rate recorded since 1982.
The overall fiscal deficit a n d domestic financing are estimated t o have exceeded t h e
2.
target under the S M P by m o r e than 2 percent o f GDP in 2003. Through end-August,
performance was broadly in line with the SMP but, in September, domestic financing o f the
Govemment exceeded the target by one percent o f GDP. Wage payments were broadly in line
with the SMP, and the Govemment reached agreements with the unions to significantly reduce
the housing allowance awarded in 2003. However, there were large unbudgeted security-related
expenditures and payment o f retrenchment benefits t o workers in Luanshya to facilitate the sale
o f the RAMCOZ mine. Expenditures on PRSP priority projects fell short o f program levels,
reflecting overruns in other spending categories.
After expanding by 49 percent in 2002, g r o w t h o f reserve money decelerated t o
3.
about 17 percent in the f i r s t nine months o f 2003, a n d the B o Z observed t h e corresponding
ceiling o n ,NDA a n d the floor o n gross reserves. Over the same nine-month period, broad
money grew by about 12 percent, in l i n e with the SMP, and compared with the 12-month increase
o f 32 percent in 2002. In combination with Government’s significant financing needs, this
monetary restraint resulted in interest rates on treasury bills remaining in the range o f 30-35
percent for most o f the year. However, in the final months o f 2003, interest rates declined sharply
in response to a reduction in the cash reserve requirement (effective October 3 1) from 17.5
percent to 14 percent that was not offset by open market operations. Broad money growth i s
expected to pick up toward end-2003 following this loosening o f monetary policy and because o f
the sharply higher government spending.

4.
The overall balance o f payments t h r o u g h end-December 2003 i s expected t o b e
better t h a n projected under t h e SMP. Boosted by a 50 percent increase in copper prices in
2003, and further strong growth in nontraditional exports, total exports are estimated to increase
by about 22 percent, while total imports increased by about 13 percent. The current account and
overall balance o f payments deficits are estimated to have narrowed to 6.2 percent and 7.7
percent o f GDP, respectively, compared with 7.5 percent and 8.8 percent o f GDP, respectively, in
the SMP. The BoZ was able to meet the adjusted end-December 2003 SMP target for gross
international reserves.
T h e relatively stable t r e n d in the r e a l effective exchange rate since t h e mid-1990s

has continued t o support the g r o w t h o f nontraditional exports. During 2003, the real
effective exchange rate depreciated slightly. However, this masks significant differences in
movements o f individual currencies, with the Kwacha remaining broadly stable against the U.S.
dollar but depreciating substantially against the South African Rand and the Euro.

6.

Progress in implementing structural measures was mixed during 2003. A mediun

t e r m expenditure framework (MTEF) was discussed for the first time with stakeholders in the

preparation o f the 2004 budget, and the B o Z introduced an interbank foreign exchange market n
July 2003. However, reforms in public expenditure management were undermined by cash
releases for unbudgeted expenditures. The authorities completed an initial draft o f a financial
sector development plan (FSDP) in December 2003 to address issues identified in the 2002
FSAP. Progress was also made in developing plans to deal with three insolvent nonbank
financial institutions, and discussions continued for the privatization o f the Zambia National
Commercial B a n k (ZNCB) to a strategic investor.

The authorities have made some progress towards reaching the floating completion
7.
point under the enhanced H I P C Initiative. Measures have been implemented in the areas o f
health and education; the privatization o f ZNCB; agreement on the commercialization o f the
Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO); the preparation and implementation o f the
MTEF; and the preparation o f the PRSP progress report, a draft o f which i s being finalized. A
key outstanding area i s the maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic environment as evidenced by
a satisfactory performance under a PRGF arrangement.
Status o f Fund Relations
Zambia’s PRGF arrangement, in an amount o f SDR 278.9 million (52 percent o f
8.
quota) expired in M a r c h 2003. After consideration o f a new three-year PRGF arrangement was
precluded by large budgetary overruns, understandings were reached in July 2003 o n an SMP for
the period July-December 2003.

9.
However, a Fund mission that visited Zambia in November to conduct discussions
for the 2003 Article I V consultation found that the S M P was significantly off track mainly
because o f unsustainable expenditure policies. In the light o f these overruns, discussions
focused on revising the 2004 macro framework, including the 2004 budget, and extending the
SMP through June 2004. Understandings were reached on an extended SMP, which i s expected to
be presented to the Board in March 2004, together with the staff report for the 2003 Article I V
consultation, which will also include an ex-post assessment o f performance under past Fundsupported programs. Discussions on a new PRGF arrangement could resume after the conclusion
o f the Article I V consultation.

REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA

1999 CAS COMPLETIONREPORT
Country: Zambia

Date o f CAS: November 17, 1999

Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY2000-FY2003
C A S Completion Report prepared by:

A.

Emmanuel Y. Ablo, Lead Economist
Zoe Vantzos, Consultant
Taqi Sharif, Portfolio Manager
Date: February 8,2004

Introduction

The main purpose o f this C A S Completion Report i s to evaluate the effectiveness o f the
1.
W o r l d Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Zambia dated November 17, 1999. The C A S was
intended to cover the period FY00-FY02. However, on account o f the difficult political
conditions that followed the 2001 presidential election, it was extended to FY03. N o progress
report on the implementation o f the 1999 C A S was presented to the Board. The C A S results
matrix (Annex 1) summarizes the progress made towards the attainment o f the main goals set out
in the CAS. Annex 2 compares actual lending to planned lending over the CAS period. Annex 3
looks at planned non-lending services versus actual non-lending services. Annex 4 shows trends
in selected measures o f well-being over 1990dearly 2000s.
2.
Average incomes in Zambia have been o n a path o f almost continuous decline since
independence in 1964 largely because o f lack o f robust economic growth. Per capita income
dropped from U S 7 5 2 in 1965 to US$351 in 2002. During the 1970s and 1980s when population
was growing by about 3 percent a year, the economy grew by 1.5 percent a year. During the
1990s, the economy grew by a paltry 0.3 percent a year. However, GDP growth has picked up,
averaging 1.4 percent a year during 2000-2002.
In 199 1, Zambia achieved a peaceful transition from one-party rule to multi-party
3.
democracy. The democratically elected Govemment embarked upon a sweeping program o f
economic liberalization and privatization and accomplished a great deal during its first five-year
term o f office. Unfortunately, the zeal for economic reform waned markedly during the
Government’s second term in office as political considerations loomed larger and larger in the
run-up to the 200 1 presidential election and corruption became rampant. I t was within this
context that the 1999 CAS was prepared. The C A S aimed to bolster the Government’s flagging
zeal for economic reform and create the conditions that would halt the decline o f the living
standards o f the average Zambian.

4.
The conclusion o f the CAS Completion Report i s that the Bank’s assistance strategy was
relevant to the short-medium t e r m development goals o f the country in some respects and not so
relevant in other respects. In the areas o f privatization, private sector development, and public
sector reform, the relevance o f the strategy was clear. In the areas o f macroeconomic

- 91

-

management and the targeting o f assistance to the poor and vulnerable groups, the strategy was
not very clear.

B.

Long Term Strategic Goals

The 1999 CAS benefited from extensive Government-led consultations aimed at arriving
5.
at a new long-term development vision for the country. Although Zambia was not a CDF pilot
country, the consultations followed the C D F approach. Based on these consultations, three
strategic areas or “pillars” were identified as key to reducing poverty. These were: (1) removing
constraints to sustainable, diversified growth; (2) improving governance; and (3) increasing
access to basic services and direct poverty interventions.
The medium t e r m strategy aimed at: (1) improving macroeconomic management; (2)
6.
promoting economic growth and raising private sector efficiency and competitiveness; (3)
improving governance; and (4) increasing access to basic services. The Zambian economy had
been in decline for so long that re-igniting growth became an imperative if the Government was
to show the people that the economic reforms are bringing tangible benefits to them. Economic
growth i s not a panacea but without sustainable growth o f national output there was n o prospect
o f raising the living standards o f the majority o f the people. The CAS set a modest target o f an
annual GDP growth rate o f 3 percent as the most likely outturn.

7.
Three issues came to occupy center stage during the CAS period. One issue was the
privatization o f ZCCM in December 2000 after a long delay, followed by the withdrawal o f
Zambia Copper Investments Limited (of which Anglo American was the majority shareholder)
from Konkola Copper Mine (KCM) about a year later. A major source o f growth envisioned in
the C A S was the recovery o f copper production following the privatization o f Z C C M . The
withdrawal o f Zambia Copper Investments Limited, therefore, sent shockwaves throughout the
economy and gave privatization a bad name. Another issue that took on increasing importance
was governance as the perception grew among Zambians and donors that the Government’s
reform efforts were flagging and that corruption was becoming rampant. The third issue was
H I V i A I D S where the Government, the Bank, and other donors came to realize that the response
to the H I V i A I D S pandemic was inadequate.
8.
The Bank’s performance was mixed. On one hand, the Bank made an important
contribution towards the creation o f the conditions necessary for sustainable, diversified growth
by encouraging the Government to press ahead with the privatization program, regardless o f the
outcome o f the Z C C M privatization. O n the other hand, the results o f the Bank’s efforts to assist
the Government to achieve macroeconomic stabilization were much more modest than had been
envisaged.
C.

CAS Outcomes

9.
CAS Objectives. The W o r l d Bank’s main goal was to assist the Government to create the
conditions necessary for the achievement o f sustained economic growth and improve the l i v e s o f
Zambians. In this context, the W o r l d Bank sought to achieve a number o f outcomes relating to
the three “pillars” referred to in para. 5 above. At the outset, great emphasis was placed on the
attainment o f macroeconomic stability as shown by the share o f total lending that was allocated to
adjustment lending; approximately 50 percent. The Bank expected to work closely with the IMF
to help the Government reduce the fiscal imbalances that had hitherto stymied attempts at
stabilizing the economy. The Bank saw a pick-up in economic growth as crucial to

- 92 -

demonstrating the benefits o f the reforms, but was realistic enough to acknowledge that the pace
at which the economy could grow over the CAS period would be modest.
Indicators were developed for the low, base and high case lending scenarios. M a n y o f
10.
the indicators were couched in rather vague terms. In the base case lending scenario, for
example, expressions such as “substantial adherence to . .. macroeconomic and structural policies
and timetables ...” left a great deal o f room for disagreement.

Removing Constraints to Sustainable, DiversiJied Growth (First Pillar)
Macroeconomic Management. After nearly a decade o f attempts at macroeconomic
11.
stabilization and structural adjustment, Zambia was s t i l l plagued by severe fiscal imbalances.
The main instrument that the Bank deployed to help the Government reduce the macroeconomic
imbalances was an adjustment credit, the Fiscal Sustainability Credit (FSC). The diagnosis at the
time o f preparing the 1999 C A S was that the fiscal imbalances emanated largely from huge
parastatal losses as well as weak budget execution and expenditure control. In view o f this, the
Govemment and the Bank agreed, in the context o f the FSC, o n a number o f actions aimed at
improving fiscal management in general by improving the predictability, accountability, and
transparency o f public spending as well as extending fiscal adjustment to the operations o f
selected parastatals. In support o f the agreed actions, a total o f US$177.2 million was disbursed
under the FSC, making it the largest credit in the Bank’s portfolio during the C A S period.
T o improve fiscal management, the Bank focused o n replacing the ad-hoc cash budget
12.
system by a rule-based system (predictability); carefully monitoring commitments and penalizing
officers who exceed allocations (accountability); and publishing actual cash outlays as opposed to
planned allocations (transparency). Success in these areas was sporadic and not sustained. T o
better address these areas in the future, the Bank prepared a Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) in 2003 that analyzes public spending in Zambia
and provides a roadmap for improving public sector management.
Under the FSC, there was mixed progress, with some success achieved towards
13.
containing parastatal losses. (For example, Zambia Electricity Supply Company (ZESC0)received a cash settlement o f US$15 million from ZCCM o n account o f amount owed, and
increased i t s tariffs by 25 percent prior to Board consideration o f the FSC; the retail price o f
petroleum products was liberalized; Zambia National Oil Company (ZNOC) was put under a
liquidation plan, with i t s major assets offered for sale; agreement was reached with the Tanzanian
Govemment t o concession the TAZAMA o i l pipeline; the Govemment approved the sale o f a
majority o f shares in the INDENIrefinery; and the Bank o f Zambia enhanced i t s power to delicense deficient banks and improved i t s cash management practices.)

14.
The burden o f extemal debt also weighed heavily o n Zambia’s fiscal balances. Progress
towards the much-needed debt relief came when Zambia reached the HIPC decision point at the
end o f 2000, with the result that interim debt relief reduced Zambia’s debt service payments from
about US$600 million a year to about US$165 million a year. However, overall fiscal
management did not improve. The fiscal deficit, including grants but excluding quasi-fiscal
deficits, increased from 2.4 percent in 1999 to 7.2 percent in 2001; it fell to 5.5 percent the next
year.
Privatization. State domination o f the economy in Zambia in the past took two main
15.
forms namely, pervasive controls and extensive state ownership o f businesses. By the time o f the
1999 CAS, the bulk o f the controls on economic activity had been swept away. Substantial

- 93 -

progress had also been made on privatization, but major state assets remained to be divested.
Thus, privatization was s t i l l seen as a means o f unlocking the productive potential o f the large
number o f enterprises s t i l l under state ownership. During the C A S period, the Bank provided
financial and technical support for the Government ' s privatization agenda. T w o IDA credits were
approved during the C A S period: the Mine Township Services Project and the Copperbelt
Environment Project.

O f all the assets awaiting privatization, ZCCM was the biggest prize. At the time the
16.
C A S was written, the sale o f Z C C M had undergone five years o f long and costly delay.
Negotiations were underway for Anglo-American Corporation (AAC) to buy the largest o f the
Z C C M packages, which included Zambia's largest mine, Konkola Copper Mines (KCM). In
M a r c h 2000, the Government clinched a deal with Anglo and the assets were transferred to the
n e w owners.
17.
However, in January 2002, Anglo announced i t s intention to stop further investments in
K C M and to close down i t s operations in Zambia. Zambia faced the prospect o f losing a major
source o f employment and exports. With timely technical assistance from the Bank, the
Government agreed with Anglo on exit terms that would preserve mine production o n a
commercially viable basis. The Bank subsequently provided technical assistance to the
Government during the process o f selecting a strategic partner in K C M .
18.
In the case o f ZESCO, the Government abandoned the idea o f privatization or
concessioning in favor o f commercialization. InM a y 2003, the Government, the W o r l d Bank,
and IMF agreed o n a roadmap that outlined the major sector issues and options for ZESCO to be
operated as a commercial entity. The issues centered around the independence o f the ZESCO
Board and the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB), both o f which should be free f r o m political
interference.
Efforts were made to streamline the operations o f ZNOC, which had huge losses and
19.
inefficiencies in the past. However, the efforts failed and Z N O C was eventually placed in
liquidation. Cabinet approved the sale o f 5 percent o f government shares in the INDENI refinery.
The agreement for the concessioning o f Zambia Railways (ZR) was signed in February 2003, but
a number o f hurdles remain to be cleared before full implementation can proceed. The
discussions about the concessioning o f the TAZAMA pipeline (which i s jointly owned by the
Governments o f Zambia and Tanzania) stalled as Government started backsliding o n the whole
issue o f privatization.
20.
All in all, significant progress had been made o n privatization up until the unraveling o f
the Z C C M privatization. By the end o f 2002, a total o f 254 out o f the 280 parastatals under the
ZPA had been privatized. The withdrawal o f Anglo from Zambia, coupled with the widespread
perception that privatization i s largely responsible for rising unemployment, created a strong
political and popular backlash against privatization. As a result, the Government began to
reassess i t s strategy for the disposal o f the large public utility companies and parastatals in the
petroleum, transport, and financial sectors. The end result i s that progress made o n privatization
during the CAS period fell short o f expectation.
Economic Diversification: Historically, the Zambian economy has been over-dependent
2 1.
o n copper, especially for export earnings. Over the years there has been much rhetoric about
diversification but little or no concrete action. The CAS, therefore, sought to refocus attention o n
diversification by raising private sector efficiency and competitiveness as well as supporting
potential growth sectors such as agriculture.

- 94 -

The Bank used a combination o f lending and non-lending services to promote the goal o f
22.
diversification. The Enterprise Development Project (EDP), which predates the 1999 CAS, had
three components, including the matching grants component aimed at helping f i r m s acquire
know-how and increase production, and the line o f credit component aimed at improving the
supply o f medium and long term finance for private enterprises. The EDP succeeded to: (i)
contribute to the diversification process o f Zambian economy; (ii)
spread out financial resources
across the entire spectrum o f firms; (iii)
create jobs, generate corporate and tax revenue and
export proceeds; and (iv) contribute to the development o f financial sector. The EDP funded 192
projects by lending about U S 6 0 million by recycling repayments. Agriculture related activities
were the main beneficiary o f the EDP, receiving almost 44 percent o f total loans while mining
related loans were only 12.4 percent o f total loan disbursements. The Regional Trade Facilitation
Project (RTFP) was not envisioned in the C A S but was added in FY 2001. I t s main objective was
t o assist the Government to establish and operate an insurance facility to encourage private
sector-led growth and trade in the region, as envisaged under the A f n c a Trade Initiative (ATI).
The Agricultural Sector Investment Program ( A S P , which closed o n December 3 1,
23.
200 1) sought to achieve the following objectives: (i)
a consistent, liberalized agricultural policy
environment; (ii)
improved service delivery to both the commercial farming sectors and small
farmers; (iii)
a complementary program o f direct investment at the village level; and (iv)
additional work on rural finance. Little or n o progress was achieved in all four areas. A S P ,
which followed the sector wide approach, proved to be difficult to implement because it was
overly ambitious and lacked broad support, particularly from other donors. Agricultural policy
reversals and interventions by the Government in input markets continued during the C A S period
and a planned study to review the Government’s rural development strategy was not done. Also,
studies on rural finance, a key constraint to agricultural development, were not done.
The Bank used two pieces of analytical work to help deepen understanding o f the
24.
constraints to sustainable, diversified economic growth. The first, the Challenge o f
Competitiveness and Diversification study, highlighted a number o f problems which contribute to
raising the costs o f doing business in Zambia, namely:
0

macroeconomic instability, with the attendant difficulties in exchange rate risk
management;
inadequate government support in dealing with ‘rules o f origin’, border delays, and other
non-tariff barriers;
very high costs for a range o f intermediate inputs and services, including fuel, cement,
packaging materials, and engineering and legal services;
inefficient administration o f duty drawback, VAT refund and other export incentive
schemes;
very high cost o f finance, contributing to the concentration o f growth amongst foreign
firms with access t o off-shore finance or other companies with access to concessionary
lines o f credit; and
unreliable service and/or very high cost o f infrastructure and transport services.

The second piece of analytical work i s the Financial Sector Assessment (FSA). The most
25.
disturbing finding o f the study was that virtually all the state-owned financial institutions, which
once dominated the Zambian banking scene, are insolvent. Their accumulated losses were
conservatively estimated at US$136 million. The report also drew attention to the high and
volatile interest rates resulting from the unstable macroeconomic environment.

- 95 -

Infrastructure Development. The Bank recognized that supporting infrastructure was
26.
needed for economic diversification; hence the attention paid to roads and the public transport
and utility companies in the CAS.
Bank instruments in support o f infrastructure development included the Road Sector
27.
Investment Program (ROADSIP) which predates the CAS. The Government’s poor performance
with regard to the funding o f road maintenance continued during the CAS period although the
financing o f other elements o f the program were at or above target. Also, the adoption o f the
policy reform agenda was delayed and the institutional reforms were not carried out as expected,
but were subsequently brought back on track and are under implementation under the ROADSIP.
The road network quality targets were generally reached, except for feeder roads, and innovative
approaches such as community transport infrastructure and intermediate means o f transport were
introduced.
The C A S provided for a Transport Sector Strategy review. N o such stand-alone piece o f
28.
work was done. Rather work was done under the ROADSIP in support o f the analysis o f the
proposed transport sector policy framework document and i t s application to the proposed road
sector institutional reform process. Three laws were subsequently enacted, setting up the Road
Fund Agency, the Road Development Agency and Road Transport and Safety Agency.
Other efforts to improve infrastructure were supported by the Railways Restructuring
29.
Project, the Power Rehabilitation Project (approved in Feb., 1998), Urban Restructuring and
Water Supply Project (closed December 3 1,2001), and the M i n e Township Services Project
(approved in June 2000). The outcomes in respect o f the public transport companies and utilities
have already been discussed. With regard to water and sanitation, the Bank has, through two
projects-Mine Township Services Project and Urban Restructuring and Water Supply
Project-reached 88 percent o f Zambia’s urban population, providing more reliable and safe
water and improved sewerage services. The Bank’s work has focused on the urban sector largely
because i t i s an area in which other donors are not involved and also because it i s strategically
relevant, given Zambia’s high level o f urbanization (45 percent) and rising urban poverty.

The devolution o f authority for service provision from central government to local
30.
authorities and private enterprises has resulted in the creation o f commercialized utilities (CUs).
A regulatory system was instituted to balance the interests o f consumers and service providers.
The CUs are not yet operationally or financially viable; viability i s critical to achieving efficient
service delivery and expanding services to the urban population currently unserved. The M i n e
Township Services Project has successfully demonstrated a model to achieve sustainable C U
operations through cost reduction, demand management, cost recovery and commercial
principles, and the participation o f the private sector in service delivery.
Improving Governance (Second Pillar)
Transparency and Accountability, and Public Service Efficiency and Capacity. The
3 1.
Bank’s focus was directed at budget management and public service reforms. T w o Bankfinanced projects provided support for the Government’s efforts t o improve governance namely,
the Fiscal Sustainability Credit and the Public Service Capacity Building Program (PSCAP). The
objectives and results o f the FSC have already been discussed. PSCAP was designed to work in
tandem with adjustment lending and focuses o n restructuring the public service and the
development and implementation o f a comprehensive fiscal reform program. T w o pieces o f
analytical work to support the dialogue and lending in the area o f governance were carried out

- 96 -

during the C A S period. These are the Public Expenditure Review (PER) and the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR).
32.
T o improve budget management, the Government initiated the process o f putting in place
a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to improve resource allocation and use.
Similarly, i t embarked upon the development o f an Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS), which integrates and links budgeting and auditing systems. Progress on almost
a l l fronts in respect o f improving governance has been lackluster. Government has failed to
achieve budget predictability because the discipline needed t o do so has been lacking. As a
result, cash releases by MFNP remain erratic and payment arrears build up.
Moreover, little was accomplished by way o f restructuring an oversized, underpaid, and
33.
de-motivated public service. The result i s that the public service remains inefficient and
ineffective. The wage bill continues to crowd out operating and maintenance expenditures.
Rather than coming down, the civil service wage bill has shot up from 5.5 percent o f GDP in
2000 to 8 percent in 2002. The Government s t i l l lacks accurate payroll data.
34.
During much o f the CAS period, corruption reportedly took a turn for the worse and the
Bank was perceived by many c i v i l society organizations and even other donors to have turned a
blind eye to what was going on. However, under PSCAP, the Bank financed a survey o f
corruption as seen through the eyes o f various stakeholders. Since his assumption o f office in
January 2002, President Mwanawasa has pushed the fight against corruption in public l i f e to the
top o f his Government’s agenda.
Increasing Access to Basic Services and Direct Poverty Interventions (Third Pillar)

35.
The CAS focus here was on H I V / A I D S prevention, improvement o f basic health and
education and targeted interventions in support o f vulnerable groups. Each o f these areas i s
discussed below.
H I V / A I D S Prevention. By 1997, the adult HIV prevalence rate in Zambia was estimated
36.
at 19 percent, which was one o f the highest in the region. This was in spite o f the fact that a
multi-sector H I V I A I D S Control and Prevention Program had been established in 1986. In view
o f the growing threat posed by the disease, the 1999 C A S envisioned stepped-up support for the
Government’s H I V / A I D S prevention efforts in order to slow down the increase in the rate o f n e w
H I V / A I D S cases reported, and increase the contraceptive prevalence rate from 14 percent in 1997
to 22 percent by 200 1.

A MAP project to support the Government’s National Strategic Framework o n
37.
H I V / A I D S was planned for FY 2002 but was delayed until FY 2003. The project was postponed
because o f delays encountered in submitting the National A I D S Council Bill t o Parliament and
changes in W o r l d Bank safeguard procedures, which made MAP projects category B rather than
category C, requiring an environmental assessment to be carried out. Zambia, l i k e many other
countries, had also been initially reluctant to borrow money for HIV/AIDS. Fortunately, IDA
decided in September 2002 t o fund future HIVIAIDS projects with grants. The Zambia MAP
project was thus approved in December 2002 as a grant rather than a credit, but i t came too late to
have an impact during the C A S period.
An H I V I A I D S component was also added to the Bank’s education program in FY 2000
38.
to address prevention, advocacy, and sensitization. The component focused on integrating

- 97 -

H I V / A I D S education into the school curriculum and dealing with the issue o f the rising number
o f reported cases o f HlV infection among students and teachers.

In 2002, the sero-prevalence was estimated at around 20 percent. If this figure i s
39.
confirmed, it would mean that the Government’s efforts to slow down the rate o f HIV infection
have not started to yield the desired result.
40.
Basic Health. Health indicators in Zambia have been deteriorating since the economic
decline set in nearly three decades ago. In the light o f this situation, the Bank aimed to upgrade
the Bank-financed Health Sector Support Project (HSSP) from a problem project and improve
health outcomes, for example, by lowering the infant mortality rate (IMR) f r o m i t s 1997 level o f
109 to 100 per 1,000 live births by 2001 and the maternal mortality rate (MMR) from 649 to 600
per 100,000 live births.
The HSSP, which was designed to support health sector reforms, was extended in 1999,
41.
despite being a problem project, in order to allow for additional disbursements and perhaps
achieve the intended development objectives. However, it remained a problem project, with
minimal funds disbursed during the CAS period, and closed in June 2002.
Given the difficulties encountered in implementing the HSSP and the failure o f the
42.
project to achieve i t s development objectives, it i s not surprising that health outcomes in Zambia
continued to deteriorate.
Basic Education. As in health, education indicators in Zambia have also been
43.
deteriorating. For example, the primary school enrollment rate fell from 88 percent in 1985 to 69
percent in 1996. To begin to halt the deterioration, the Government aimed to increase net primary
school enrollment by 4 percent annually, from 1.63 million students to 2.5 m i l l i o n by FY2002
and improve learning achievement.
44.
Since 1999, the Bank has been supporting the Government’s Basic Education Sub-sector
Investment Program (BESSIP - approved April 1999) through the first o f t w o planned credits
under the Adaptable Program Lending (APL). BESSIP i s modeled on the Sector-Wide Approach
(SWAP) and serves as a coordinating mechanism for the donor community. The program i s
supported by 12 donors, including IDA. BESSIP has led to the establishment o f District
Education Boards in every district in 5 o f Zambia’s 9 provinces; improvements in primary school
infrastructure, including the construction o f over 2,000 classrooms; and enhanced teacher training
and readiness.
45,
Enrollment increased by 2 percent a year until 2002, when it increased by 7 percent
following the introduction o f the free primary education policy, which prohibited PTA fees as
user fees. This policy has effectively helped to eliminate the financial barrier t o attending school.
T o measure learning achievement, the first National Assessments o f Education Achievement
were administered to Grade 5 students in 1999 and 2001. The tests revealed modest
improvements over the period. The mean English score was 33 percent in both 1999 and 200 1,
while the Mathematics score improved from 33 percent in 1999 to 36 percent in 2001.
Targeted Interventions in Support o f Vulnerable Groups. The poverty indicators in
46.
Zambia are among the worst in the region. In the late 1990s, headcount poverty was 73 percent
and stunting among children five years o l d or younger was 47 percent. The CAS, therefore, set
out to reduce the incidence o f poverty; increase the number o f social development projects
located in the most remote areas in the poorest districts from 40 percent in 1998 t o 65 percent by

- 98 -

FY2002; increase the ratio o f assistance to women and orphans under the Zambia Local
Development Fund, and secure Cabinet approval and implementation o f the gender policy.

As things turned out, the Bank did not have a safety net program during the C A S period.
This was a gaping hole in the Bank’s assistance strategy, given the economic and social upheaval
caused by the dismantling o f the command economy that prevailed prior to 1992.
47.

Other CAS Outcomes

48.
Drought. An issue that came to the fore during the C A S period was the drought that
affected a number o f countries in southern and eastern Africa. Zambia was one o f the worstaffected countries. The production o f maize, the staple food-crop, i s estimated to have dropped
from 802,000 metric tons in 2000/2001 to 664,000 metric tons in 2001/2002. The occurrence o f a
drought o f this severity at a time o f widespread poverty posed a big challenge for the
Government. The Bank responded in a timely fashion with the Emergency Drought Recovery
Project o f US$50 million in grants.
Summary Assessment. During the CAS period, overall progress in terms o f the C A S
49.
outcomes has been mixed. On the achievement side, growth rates grew at modest levels; higher
percentages o f both urban (88 percent) and rural (48 percent) populations had access to safe water
supplies; contraceptive prevalence rate improved to 22 percent; the H P C decision point was
reached in December 2000 thereby significantly reducing Government’s debt service payments
f r o m US$600 m i l l i o n to US$165 million per year; financial performance o f a number o f
remaining parastatals has improved; exports o f non-traditional commodities increased materially;
receipts from international tourism rose steadily; rehabilitation o f main and trunk roads network
reached i t s financing target, whilst paved roads in good condition exceeded target; the PRSP and
baseline study for a monitoring system were completed; number o f public accountants has
increased and procurement units in all ministries have been established; decentralization policy
was approved by Parliament; an H I V / A I D S program under MAP was launched; enrollments grew
gradually, and test scores improved modestly.

50.
On the other hand, the C A S outcomes were significantly less than those envisaged in
Novemberl999. Overall poverty levels appear to have remained at the same level (73 percent
Zambians estimated to live below the poverty line); adult HIV sero-prevalence rate remains
around 20 percent; Government’s record on privatization has been mixed, creating uncertainty
and adversely impacting upon private investment; study o n Govemment/Bank rural development
strategy for Zambia was not undertaken; maintenance funds for roads, particularly rural roads,
was well below target; retrenchment program in public sector has been slow and difficult; and,
basic health indicators did not show any improvement.
Sustainability. Insufficient progress towards poverty reduction objectives over the C A S
5 1.
period were due to macroeconomic instability, weak political commitment, and the lack o f
Government capacity to deliver the public services. The new C A S participatory preparation
process and the anticipated further release o f H P C resources have created a momentum that
augurs well for the sustainability o f the reforms achieved so far and the chance o f deepening the
reform agenda further. H I V / A I D S remains a serious threat t o Zambia’s development prospects.
However, continued economic growth and a visible increase in Government commitment to
resolve governance and poverty issues should help t o mitigate these risks in the coming years.

D.

Bank Performance

52.
Portfolio Assessment. Under the base case scenario, lending over the period FY00-FY02
was anticipated t o be US$375 million, divided almost evenly between adjustment and investment
lending. The l o w case scenario, which would have been triggered in the case o f civil strife,
Zambia being drawn into a regional conflict, reversals in economic policies, acute governance
problems, or a failure to complete the Z C C M privatization, entailed a reduction in lending to
US$90 million. The triggers for the high case scenario were GDP growth rates exceeding 5
percent, improved governance, and deepened reforms in the agricultural and social sectors. These
events would justify lending in the range o f US$410-500 million. During the extended CAS
period (December 1999 - December 2003), seven projects were approved with commitments
totaling US$501.9 million (see Annex 2).
The performance o f the W o r l d Bank lending portfolio fluctuated during the C A S period
53.
due to varying economic and political factors. The sale o f Z C C M appeared to have led to
improved Government focus on other issues and progress in the implementation o f donor
projects. This improvement was, however, short-lived, as all the performance indicators
deteriorated in the following year; most significantly, the number o f projects at risk in the
portfolio increased f r o m 2 (14 percent) to 5 (3 1 percent). This was partly a reflection o f the
uncertain political environment in Zambia during the run-up to the December 200 1 elections. The
Country Office recruited a procurement specialist and a financial management specialist as part
o f the Africa Region-wide program o f placing these specialists in countries where the Bank has
an active lending program.
T w o CPPRs were carried out during the C A S period: an interim CPPR in November
54.
200 1 and a comprehensive CPPR in June 2003. B o t h CPPRs identified slow disbursement as a
major implementation issue. Slow disbursement in turn was found to be due to inadequate and
irregular releases o f Govemment counterpart funds, inefficient and slow procurement and weak
project management.

55.
Over the C A S period, QAG rated project quality at entry at 100 percent and quality o f
supervision at 66 percent.23 In the previous CAS period, FY 1997-99, the quality o f entry was
rated at 100 percent and the quality o f supervision was rated 73 percent. During FY00-FY02,
OED found 73 percent o f projects to be satisfactory and 43 percent o f the project outcomes as
likely to be sustained, compared to a 70 percent satisfactory rating and a 30 percent sustainability
rating during FY97-FY99.24
Non-lending activities during the CAS period included the PRSP and HIPC Debt
56.
Initiative. Others were the Public Expenditure Review, which was rated “Best Practice” by
QAG, and PEMFAR. However, AAA activities were, by and large, not completed o n
schedule. Moreover, a number o f formal and informal products were dropped. Inretrospect,
23 The sample size o f the QAG data i s acutely small, and drawing conclusions f r o m the Q A G data i s
problematical because it is not clear that the rated projects are reflective o f the portfolio at large. During
the CAS period (FY 2000-02), only one project was rated for quality o f entry (in FY 2001). Furthermore,
the figure reported for quality o f supervision i s based o n only three observations (two for FY 2000 and one
for FY 2003). There i s also one observation for FY 2001, but in this year QAG rated only risky projects
and evaluations f r o m this year are not deemed by QAG t o be comparable to other fiscal years because the
unique methodology used during this year. In terms o f the previous C A S period (FY 1997-99), there are a
total o f two observations for quality at entry, while there are eleven observations for quality o f supervision.
24

O E D rated seven projects during FY 2000-02 and ten projects during FY 1997-1999.
- 100 -

it seems that the CAS AAA targets were too ambitious; see Annex 3 for a complete l i s t o f
non-lending activities.

Countrv dialogue and aid coordination. As the 1999 C A S was designed, the W o r l d
57.
Bank actively engaged key stakeholders in the process through consultation and coordination.
Although Zambia was not a CDF pilot country, the CAS nevertheless adopted the C D F
approach, initiating a wider government-led process to forge a common long-term vision and
development framework. Groups consulted in the CAS/CDF process included local and
national government representatives, local bilateral and multilateral development partners,
heads o f UN agencies, NGOs, trade unions, church groups, private sector representatives,
new mine owners, academics, parliamentarians, former senior government officials, and a
sample o f poor urban and rural communities through the Poverty Assessment Group.
(Continued close collaboration between IMF/IFC/IDA can serve as the basis for a future C D F
for Zambia). The extent to which the Government took into account the views o f these
various stakeholders i s hard t o determine.

58.
Despite concerted efforts to follow a coordinated development strategy, partnership
among donors was strong in some sectors and weak in others. Weak partnership was
particularly noticeable in the health sector where relations between the Government and the
Bank deteriorated as disagreements over the HSSP dragged on. This contributed to delays in
designing and implementing an effective H I V / A I D S prevention program. Against this could
be set the example o f strong coordination in the roads subsector where the existence o f strong
coordination mechanisms o n the Government side - using the National Roads Board - have
contributed to good implementation performance (though not quite as successful on policy
and reform issues).

E. Lessons Learned
59.
The conclusions o f this C A S Completion Report tally with the main findings and
recommendations o f the OED’s November 2002 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) covering
the FY96-0 1 period. The overall conclusion o f the C A E was that the outcomes from the 1996
C A S and the 1999 CAS were generally poor. The CAE noted that progress o n macroeconomic
stabilization was particularly disappointing despite the considerable amount o f adjustment
lending that took place. The CAE went on to recommend better use o f the instruments at the
Bank’s disposal so as to have the greatest impact in three areas that i t identified as being o f
primary importance for economic growth and poverty reduction. These are: public expenditure
management and governance; the investment climate; and H I V I A I D S .
The following lessons emerge from this review o f the 1999 CAS:

60.
0

0

0

country dialogue and ownership have to go beyond pro-forma consultations between
Government and other stakeholders, with the Government seen t o be actually taking into
account the views o f all major stakeholders and not just those o f the foreign donors;
reforms are not likely t o be sustained if policy dialogue i s confined to a small economic
team in Government (Minister o f Finance, a handful o f sector Ministers, Governor o f the
central bank) and the majority o f the political leadership i s excluded and thus not well
informed;
in the absence o f improved governance and public sector management as well as a stable
macroeconomic environment, liberalization and privatization by themselves could not
provide the stimulus for increased private investment, and

- 101 -

0

0

0

investment in the modernization o f agriculture has to be an essential element o f a
diversified and pro-poor growth strategy.
A focus only on preparation o f a given piece o f economic and sector work, without
enough attention paid to dissemination o f the report and feeding i t s findings into dialogue
and lending operations, i s inadequate.
Implementation i s key to a successful reform program. The weak implementation in
Zambia was partly due to shortage o f qualified personnel in certain key areas but largely
due to inadequate incentives and sanctions and to the pervasive failure to apply laws and
regulations and adhere to established systems and procedures.

The experience o f the 1999 CAS shows that, without conviction at the highest political
61.
levels, reforms can quickly stall or even unravel. This i s what happened in the run-up to the
200 1elections. Privatization became a political liability as the program became increasing
unpopular among Zambians. This new-found aversion to privatization has carried over into the
new administration which n o w talks o f commercialization rather than privatization or
concessioning.

On issues absolutely critical t o turning the Zambian economy around, especially
62.
improved public sector management, macroeconomic stabilization and HIV/AIDS, there i s n o
substitute for sustained dialogue with the Government. An important input into country dialogue
i s analytical work. But as often happens, there was too much focus on the preparation o f a given
piece o f economic and sector work and not enough attention paid t o dissemination o f the report
and feeding i t s findings into dialogue and lending operations.

By and large, agreeing on policies and programs was the easy part o f the Bank’s relations
63.
with the Government. The really difficult part was and continues to be implementation. Weak
implementation i s partly due to shortage of qualified personnel in certain key areas, but i t i s
largely due to inadequate incentives and sanctions and to the pervasive failure to apply laws and
regulations and adhere to established systems and procedures.
The failed attempts at macroeconomic stabilization over the past twelve years cannot
64.
inspire confidence in the Government’s ability to manage the economy. Therefore, attainment o f
macroeconomic stability has to be the starting point for restoring the confidence o f investors and
the general public in the Government’s capacity to manage the economy. T o achieve this
macroeconomic stability, Government needs to break with the past. There are economic success
stories from the region that Zambia could learn from. The best example comes from Botswana,
which i s one o f Zambia’s neighbors. Other examples are Mozambique and Uganda that have,
each in i t s own way, achieved a dramatic economic turn-around and moved o n t o a path o f rapid,
sustained GDP growth.
