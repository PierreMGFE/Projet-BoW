Executive Summary
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s being prepared at a difficult and uncertain
time for Bolivia. There has been an escalating trend o f social unrest-with serious conflicts in
April 2000, September/October 2000, January 2002, and February 2003. These conflicts
culminated in the forced resignation o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003
and the assumption (in accordance with constitutional processes) o f Vice President Carlos Mesa
as President.
Current Situation

Bolivia’s current situation i s the result o f the volatile confluence o f three trendseconomic, political, and social-that have been building up over several years. On the economic
side, three features stand out-a lack o f progress in poverty reduction and high inequality, a
vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks, and a precarious fiscal situation.
O n the political side, there has been a growing disenchantment with the overt use o f
political patronage and the tolerance, if not actual support, o f corruption, on the part o f the
traditional political parties. With the recent change in administration, this disenchantment gave
way to a total rejection o f the traditional parties, and the Mesa cabinet was formed out o f
independent members. The last several years have also witnessed the rise o f new political parties
closely aligned with indigenous groups. Neither the government nor the partners that work with
the government can afford to ignore the new voices. The challenge w i l l be to incorporate a
multicultural perspective in a way that does not cut o f f the poor and indigenous people from the
economic opportunities offered b y economic integration with the outside world.
O n the social side, there i s an increasing impatience with the levels o f inequality,
particularly in land distribution. Indigenous groups feel that they have received little from the
exploitation o f natural resources in the past-silver
and tin. These deep suspicions, plus
suspicions o f the capitalization process, fed opposition to the natural gas export project. General
discontent was also fed b y lack o f progress in income-related measures o f poverty. There has
been progress in social indicators, but i t has been uneven and has not been perceived b y
disaffected groups as enough.
Government Strategy

The government o f President Mesa that took over in a constitutional transition on
October 17, 2003 following the forced resignation o f Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has moved
quickly to formulate i t s plans. The plans have been formulated to cover two periods: (a) a first
phase-from the present to the planned completion o f a Constitutional Assembly (expected to
take between 14 and 18 months), and (b) a second phase-from the end o f the Constitutional
Assembly to the end o f the constitutional term o f the President (that is, until August 6, 2007).
During the first phase, the government w i l l be pursuing the following three political
objectives:
0

Revising the hydrocarbons law;

0

Submitting the decision to export natural gas to a public referendum;

0

Calling for a Constitutional Assembly t o modify the existing Constitution.
1

In addition to the three political objectives, the government w i l l be attempting to achieve the
following three economic objectives:

Restoring macroeconomic stability
Reorienting some public expenditure toward high-visibility programs that respond to
underlying factors that led to social conflict, especially in sensitive geographical areas
Relaunching the institutional reform program and anticomption efforts.
The second phase o f the Mesa administration would begin once the Constitutional
Assembly ends. B y the beginning o f the second phase, the government would hope to have: (i)
passed the potentially divisive processes o f the gas referendum and the Constitutional Assembly
with sufficient internal cohesion to maintain social peace and to move forward to solve problems
o f inequality, exclusion and poverty; (ii)formulated a revised Poverty Reduction Strategy,
having passed a period o f consultation with civil society; (iii)
instituted a fiscal pact, where civil
society would recognize the difficult fiscal situation and would be agreeable to measures
designed to raise revenue in a progressive way and to moderate growth in expenditure,
particularly in the wage bill; and (iv) adjusted the portfolio o f international assistance so as to
make past reforms financially sustainable and so as to be aligned with the revised Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
The government w i l l move relatively quickly to start revising the PRSP that was
reviewed by the Board in June 2001. This revision w i l l place greater emphasis on increasing
income opportunities for the poor and achieving Millenium Development Goals (MDGs). A new
process o f National Dialogue in support o f the revision i s already underway.

IDA/IBRD Strategy
Given the particular circumstances in Bolivia, to be effective the World Bank (WB)
cannot adopt a business-as-usual approach. N o t all the expected elements for preparing a
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) in an International Development Association (IDA) country
are in place. For example, i t w i l l be impossible to have a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) with adequate consultation for many months. In the meantime, there are critical areas
where government needs to move forward and needs World Bank help to do so.
Bank management proposes a strong package o f financial assistance and rapidly
delivered technical assistance to be included under the CAS that would cover two years, FY04
and FY05. The relatively short period to be covered by this CAS i s due to the uncertainty that i s
generated by the plan to hold a Constitutional Assembly over the next 18 months.
The proposed financial resources to be provided to Bolivia are up to US$lOO million a
year in the base case scenario, up to U S $ l 5 0 million a year in the high case scenario, and
approximately US$45 million a year in the l o w case scenario. The proposed level o f assistance
in the base case would be sufficient to support an average o f four projects and four pieces o f
Economic and Sector Work (ESW) per year during 2004-05. The composition o f the lending
program would be 50 percent adjustment and 50 percent investment lending.
Because Bolivia’s gross national income (GNI) per capita i s projected to fall below the
International Development Agency (IDA) cutoff and to remain below that cutoff for several
years, Bank management proposes to delay graduation of Bolivia from IDA, and for Bolivia to

11

remain a blend country through the end o f the IDA 14 cycle. In the low case scenario, Bolivia
would be provided access only to IDA, while in both the base and high case scenarios Bolivia
would receive a blend o f IDA and IBRD resources.

This support would be aligned closely with the government’s program. There are 15
projects in the existing portfolio that are at different stages o f implementation. The original
amount o f these credits was US$592.2 million, and as o f November 24, 2003 there remained an
undisbursed balance o f US$286.6 million.
Three projects are proposed for FY04. T w o projects, the Emergency Economic Recovery
Credit (US$14 M i l l i o n IDA) and the First Programmatic Bank and Corporate Sector
Restructuring Project (US$15 M i l l i o n IDA and US$15 M i l l i o n IBRD), would respond to the
problems o f maintaining macroeconomic stability. One project, the Social Sector Programmatic
Credit (US$20 M i l l i o n IDA), would help maintain progress in health, education and water and
sanitation and would accelerate progress towards MDGs by reducing disparities in outcomes
across different regions, ethnic groups and income classes.
Five projects are proposed for FY05. T w o projects, the Land Reform Project and the
Spatial Rural Development/Community-driven Development Project, respond directly to the
problems o f inequality and to the problems that the poor have in generating income. One
project, the possible Second Programmatic Bank and Corporate Restructuring Loan or the Fiscal
Adjustment Loan, responds to problems o f maintaining macroeconomic stability. One project,
the Second Institutional Reform Project, would help the government relaunch i t s institutional
reform and anti-corruption programs, one o f the current high priorities. The fifth project, the
Secondary Education Project, does not respond to an immediate short-term priority, but i s
necessary and important to allow the country to continue with i t s successful ongoing Education
Reform program. The Education Reform i s one o f the few government programs that could be
considered truly a state policy, as i t has been supported across several different administrations.
In addition to these projects, Economic and Sector Work proposed for FY04 would
consist o f a Public Expenditure Review (PER), a Country Financial and Accountability
Assessment (CFAA), a Poverty Assessment, an Education Sector Study and a Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis. The proposed E S W program for FY05 would concentrate on issues related to
growth, especially the problems faced b y the poor in generating income. The major piece o f
ESW would be a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focusing on growth recovery and
trade. Given that such a high percentage o f the economy in Bolivia i s informal, the C E M would
be complemented by a labor and informal market study. Other pieces o f ESW for FY05 include
a study on conflict analysis and resolution and an analysis o f Bolivia’s Social Protection
Framework.

IFC Strategy
In conjunction with the Bank support to growth, I F C w i l l continue to provide support for
private sector development over the next CAS period. IFC’s support w i l l focus on: (i)
monitoring o f the existing portfolio to ensure that IFC-financed projects could weather these
difficult times, (ii)technical assistance and capacity building through a new regional S M E
facility to strengthen small and medium enterprises and microenterprises; and (iii)selectively
providing financing for viable, high impact projects in such sectors as the hydrocarbons sector,

...

111

infrastructure including power, the social sectors, the financial market, and mining, provided that
there i s suitable investment climate in the country and the sector.

WBI Strategy
In the next CAS program, there w i l l be a concerted effort to increase the focus o f World
Bank Institute (WBI) programs compared to how the program was managed in the past. It i s
expected that 80 percent o f the WBI program would be focused on the following four priority
areas: (i)
improving governance, with a focus on anticorruption and enhancement o f institutional
capacity; (ii)improving voice, accountability and inclusion; (iii)pro-poor growth; and (iv)
achieving MDGs. The remaining 20 percent o f the WBI program would cover a variety o f
ongoing regional programs.

Conclusion
The World Bank has supported Bolivia extensively, and as Bolivia now faces high risks
and uncertainty, the World Bank Group can provide strong support through a combination o f
lending tailored to current needs, a comprehensive package of ESW, support to the private sector
provided by the IFC and the knowledge shared by the WBI to make i t more likely that Bolivia
could address i t s problems of exclusion, inequality, poverty and fiscal imbalance.

I.INTRODUCTION
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s being prepared at a difficult and uncertain
time for Bolivia. There has been an escalating trend o f social unrest-with serious conflicts in
April 2000, September/October 2000, January 2002, and February 2003. These conflicts
culminated in the forced resignation o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003
and the assumption (in accordance with constitutional processes) of Vice President Carlos Mesa
as President. H e faces numerous challenges in trying to resolve the country’s economic,
political, and social problems, and the way forward i s not entirely clear.
2.
The typical approach to uncertainty o f backloading support i s not appropriate at this
decisive moment in Bolivia’s history. There are risks in Bolivia, but these risks w i l l be higher if
the World Bank does not remain actively engaged. However, for the World Bank to be effective,
i t w i l l be necessary to adapt to the difficult circumstances. N o t all the expected elements for
preparing a CAS in an International Development Association (IDA) country are in place, and
the World Bank cannot adopt a business-as-usual approach. For example, i t w i l l be impossible
to have a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) with adequate consultation for many months.
In the meantime, there are critical areas where government needs to move forward and needs
World Bank help to do so.

3.
Bank management proposes a strong package o f financial assistance and rapidly
delivered technical assistance to be delivered under a CAS that would cover two years, F Y 0 4 and
FY05. This support would be aligned closely with the government’s program and, together with
the continued implementation o f the existing portfolio, the new programs would help the country
address problems o f exclusion, inequality, poverty and fiscal imbalance. The relatively short
period to be covered by this CAS i s due to the uncertainty that i s generated by the plan to hold a
Constitutional Assembly over the next 18 months. The exact date i s unknown at this time.
While the changes coming out o f the Constitutional Assembly could be positive or possibly
negative and minor, once the Assembly i s convened it would have the power to change anything
in the Constitution.
4.
A new CAS would be prepared to cover FY06 and beyond, when i t i s likely that the
outcome o f the Constitutional Assembly would be known. Provided there i s a viable economic,
political, and social arena in which the Bank can be effective, the Bank would be prepared to
work on a comprehensive program that would include further initiatives to address inequality
and lack o f income generation for the poor. I f i t proves extremely difficult to operate, the Bank
would limit i t s activities to basic investments in infrastructure and the social sectors.

On the economic side, three features stand out-a lack o f progress in poverty reduction
and high inequality, a vulnerability o f the economy to external shocks, and a precarious fiscal

situation. Poverty reduction has been slow when reasonable rates o f growth occurred (19901997). When growth rates declined (1998-2002), poverty increased (see Table 1).

7.
Poverty outcomes have also been very uneven-with
significant differences across
divisions o f ruralhrban, highlandlowland, and indigenoushonindigenous groups. The lack o f
significant progress in poverty reduction, the l o w level o f private domestic investment (less than
1 percent o f GDP in 2002), the stagnation o f exports over the last 20 years (although the
composition has changed), and continued high levels o f informality have led to increasing
questioning o f the ability of the “economic model” to deliver the goods.
8.
Bolivia’s inability to make more rapid and sustained progress in poverty reduction i s due,
in part, to the economy being buffeted by shocks-both positive and negative and both external
and internal. High growth in the 1990s was sparked by positive external shocks that led to the
expansion o f service sectors and exports. In a pattern typical o f positive shocks, there followed a
bank credit boom, a shift in relative prices favoring the nontradable sector, and increases in tax
revenue with attendant increases in government expenditure. International reserves climbed and
the primary fiscal balance before pensions reached 2.5 percent o f GDP. At the end o f 1997,
there were expectations o f sustained high growth for the entire Latin American region, including
Bolivia.

9.
Unfortunately, the good times did not last and the positive shocks o f the early and mid1990s were followed by negative shocks in the late 1990s. As a result o f the international capital
market crisis o f the late 1990s, there was a sudden drop in external financing, leading to a
reduction in growth in the entire Latin American region. Bolivia suffered along with other
countries.
10.
Slower growth in trading partners l e d to slower growth in Bolivia as a result o f lower
demand for Bolivian goods and lower levels o f remittances, principally from Bolivian workers in
Argentina.
The Brazilian and Argentine devaluations dramatically affected Bolivia’s

2

competitiveness. On the domestic side, a 70-percent drop in coca production between 1998 and
2002, while an important advance for the country as a whole, did reduce incomes. These shocks
were only partly compensated for b y the exploitation o f new gas reserves. The net result of these
shocks put considerable strain on the corporate and banking sectors. Moreover, the accelerated
depreciation needed to maintain competitiveness in the face of Brazilian and Argentinian
devaluations did have the effect o f increasing debt service burdens since virtually all lending i s
dollarized. As the slowdown in growth occurred, the response of the government and private
banks to strengthen the financial sector led to a credit crunch.' The overall lending portfolio
shrank (as the banks adjusted to the less-promising investment climate) and the share o f
nonperforming loans increased (see Figure 1).

These shocks and the resulting slowdown in growth led to drops in per capita income (see
Table 2), increases in poverty, and pressure on the fiscal balance.

1 During 1995-2000 the Superintendencia de Buncos y Entidades Financieras (SBEF) passed several important
new regulations, aimed at strengthening banks and enhancing supervision. The most salient o f them included
new capital rules, as a result o f which bank capital more than doubled during 1995-2000, from US$235 million
to US$495 million. The impact o f these regulations in terms o f credit availability was stronger after the shock o f
the late 199Os, when banks stopped borrowing abroad and the economy started to decelerate, leading both to
scarce bank liquidity.

T h e f a l l in per capita income was n o t uniform (see Figure 2). T h e drop was greatest
among the lowest income deciles in the rural areas and in a l l but the wealthiest decile in the
urban areas. T h e recent decline in per capita income in urban areas has fueled the increasing
social unrest.

With the negative shocks, tax revenue fell, but the government was unable to cut
expenditures accordingly to sustain fiscal balance. In 2002 the fiscal deficit reached 8.9 percent,
and for 2003 i t appears that i t will decline only slightly to 8.1 percent. T h e resulting fiscal deficit
i s a c o m m o n occurrence with this pattern of positive and then negative shocks. In Bolivia, the
fiscal imbalance was magnified by the election uncertainty and social unrest.
14.
T h e fiscal problems caused by a pattern o f first positive then negative shocks were
exacerbated by increasing costs of reforms, particularly in pensions (see Figure 3). In some
cases, there were political decisions that affected the w a y in w h i c h reforms were implemented.
In other cases, with hindsight, some of the reforms were either premature or relied on
assumptions that the relatively high growth rates of the mid-1990s would continue in order to

4

cover future costs. In the mid-1990s many Latin American countries had overly optimistic
growth projections, which caused them to underestimate the fiscal impacts of pension reforms.

There has been some negative feedback from political and social events to the economic
situation. The social conflicts o f October 2003 may have persistent negative effects on the
economic prospects for L a Paz/E1 Alto-scaring
away potential investors and making the
banking system more jittery.
16.
Throughout this entire difficult period, overall growth in Bolivia has never been negative,
although per capita growth rates have been negative. This i s surprising given the magnitude o f
the shocks that the economy has faced, and stands in contrast to the experience o f other Latin
American countries (for example, Paraguay). However, i t must be noted that the official figures
may understate the true changes given that so much o f the economy i s informal and given that
many o f the shocks affected the informal economy.
17.
Looking forward, there are some promising signs as the economies o f Brazil and
Argentina have improved. This means that the external shocks reaching Bolivia are likely to be,
i f not positive, at least not as negative as they have been in the past.

B. Political
18.
Over the last decade there has been a growing disenchantment with the overt use o f
political patronage and the tolerance, if not actual support, o f corruption, on the part o f the
traditional political parties. With the 'recent change in administration, this disenchantment gave
way to a total rejection o f the traditional parties, and the Mesa cabinet was formed out o f
independent members.
19.
Other factors that have led to a loss o f prestige and credibility o f the political parties and
o f the government, in general, have been the lack o f transparency in transmitting information, the

5

poor j o b of communicating government policies, and the poor job on implementation. This latter
problem i s caused, in part, by the high turnover o f personnel associated with political patronage.

20.
The reliance on political patronage can be traced back to an electoral system that
promotes coalition building as part o f the process o f selecting the presidents. These coalitions
tend to be formed not on the basis o f shared platforms, but on the basis o f trading political
patronage. The major political parties appear to have increasing disagreements on policy
direction-compared to the late 1980s-early 1990s.
21.
The last several years have witnessed the rise o f new political parties closely aligned with
indigenous groups. The increased mobilization o f poor and long-excluded people i s a positive
force for development and for efforts to reduce poverty. The grievances and demands being
aired by leaders o f the new groups cover a wide gamut-a return to traditional values associated
with mostly rural societies, opposition to eradication o f coca cultivation and suspicion o f
“globalization,” among others. For all the variations, there i s little question that underlying these
movements i s a long history o f social exclusion and inequality. While recent transitions to
democracy have brought gains, patterns o f influence remain unequal, with favoritism, patronage
and corruption often persisting despite national and local elections.
22.
Neither the government nor the partners that work with the government can afford to
ignore the new voices. The challenge w i l l be to incorporate a multicultural perspective in a way
that does not cut o f f the poor and indigenous people from the economic opportunities offered by
economic integration with the outside world. There are risks that the political movements would
be dominated by groups that could reject the possible economic opportunities and, thereby,
condemn their own followers to continued marginalization.
C. Social

23.
There i s an increasing and understandable impatience with the levels o f inequality,
particularly as i t applies to land. Bolivia i s among the most unequal countries in the most
unequal region o f the world. Figure 4 shows the Gini coefficient for the distribution o f
household equivalized income2 for several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)
around year 2000. Bolivia clearly stands as a high-inequality country. This, combined with a
l o w per capita GDP, contributes to the high poverty levels o f the country. More specifically, the
evolution o f the shape o f the income distribution and how far the poor are initially located from
the poverty line are key factors explaining the meager poverty decline in Bolivia during the
1990s. The income distribution in Bolivia i s severely skewed to the l e f t (the distance o f the poor
from the poverty line i s among the highest in the region), particularly in rural areas, making i t
more difficult for growth to bring about immediate significant declines in poverty. Moreover,
income inequality increased over the 1990s malung growth translate into even less poverty
reduction than distribution-neutral growth. In a poor country like Bolivia, actions are needed to
both sustain high levels o f economic growth and to aid the poor to benefit disproportionally from
it.

2. Equivalized income i s defined as the sum o f the income of all individuals in the household divided by the sum o f
the number o f adults and a weighted sum of the number of children under age 5 and the number aged 6 and 14
raised to a power theta, whose value regulated the degrees of household economies of scale.

Indigenous groups feel (rightly so) that they have received little from the exploitation of
natural resources in the past-silver and tin. These deep suspicions, plus suspicions with the
capitalization process, fed opposition to the natural gas export project. General discontent was
also fed by lack o f progress in income-related measures o f poverty. There has been progress in
social indicators (again, uneven), but that has not been perceived by disaffected groups as
enough.

25.
Growing tensions are apparent among regions, classes, and indigenoushonindigenous
groups. The highland versus lowland tension also reflects a split between mainly Aymara and
mainly Spanish descendants. Part o f this tension has always been present; part has been created
b y recent events where different groups do not share the same views and objectives.
26.
As part o f the social movement, there i s a desire for greater political and economic
power. Even before the latest round o f conflicts, i t appeared that pressuring the government
through demonstrations in the streets-whether violent or otherwise-was a winning strategy.
The ability to topple a president demonstrates the power that i s present.
27.
Government has yet to be able to break this pattern o f setting policy. I t faces s t i l l another
challenge to i t s ability to break this pattern in deciding how to respond to the October crisis in El
Alto and L a Paz, without creating negative incentives in the rest o f country, and without sending
the wrong message that if a group were to instigate a violent conflict, i t would receive additional
resources.

D. Role of Past Reforms
28.
Bolivia i s known internationally for i t s series o f reforms dating back to 1985, when i t
enacted bold reforms to eliminate hyperinflation and to reduce the role o f the government in the
economy. These reforms had many notable achievements (see Annex F), with reforms in the
social sectors have been among the most successful. A greater emphasis on social policies was
followed by a greater allocation o f resources and an observed impact on social indicators. Social
expenditure increased from 15.7 percent o f GDP in 1998 to 19.6 percent in 2002 and the
efficiency and quality o f social services improved.
29.
In the health sector, the introduction and implementation o f the health reform has led to
an important increase in coverage. K e y policies under the reform included the introduction o f a
public health insurance for maternal and child interventions and a series o f vertically financed
programs t o tackle communicable diseases, an increase in health staff under the framework o f
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and the introduction o f a resultsbased scheme that set yearly targets for key health indicators. The implementation o f these
policies was followed by a significant advance in health indicators. Coverage o f skilled birth
increased from 44 percent in 1998 to 54 percent in 2001, coverage o f pre-natal control rose from
29 percent to 37 percent in the same period and a complete coverage o f pneumonias in children
under 5 was reached. Similarly, the malaria, Chagas and TB programs significantly improved
their coverage and quality. While this improvement in coverage i s remarkable, equity gaps
remain as rural, poor and indigenous have limited access to formal health services. An
intercultural approach to health care was recently introduced to reduce cultural barriers o f access
to health services.
30.
In the education sector, a transformation o f both the institutional and technicalpedagogical aspects o f the education system have taken place in the last few years. As a result o f
the implementation o f the education reform, there are several important achievements, many o f
them are reflected in the behavior o f education indicators. B y 2001, the illiteracy rate decreased
to 13.3 percent. In rural areas, there has been a drop o f 11 percentage points in illiteracy rates,
although the absolute level remains high at 25.8 percent. In urban areas, the illiteracy rate i s
considerably lower - 6.9 percent. The youth literacy rate i s now three percentage points above
the average o f the Latin America and the Caribbean region, which reaches 94.1 percent. The
gross coverage o f primary education stood at 108.4 percent while the net coverage ratio
increased to 97 percent for both girls and boys suggesting that Bolivia i s very close to achieving
equal educational opportunities. Furthermore, more children finish primary school as the
completion rate and the graduation rate improved while drop-out rates decreased. As in the
health sector, indicators at the national level conceal differences among income and ethnic
groups that have to be tackled.
31.
However, the fact that Bolivia i s in the difficult situation i t i s in today has caused many
observers (particularly domestic observers) to question how useful past reforms have been. T o
some extent, there i s a tendency within the country not to appreciate Bolivia’s vulnerability to
external shocks and not to recognize the possibility that Bolivia’s situation might have been
considerably worse if it had not enacted some of the reforms i t did-particularly
in financial
sector regulation. Of course, i t i s impossible to establish with any degree o f certainty that
Bolivia was better equipped to face the shocks with than without the reforms, because Bolivia
faced these shocks only with the reforms in place. Notwithstanding this argument, i t i s

8

impossible to refute the statement that Bolivia’s reforms were not sufficient to prevent the
country from falling into i t s current problems. This fact, alone, justifies a more critical look at
the past reforms.
32.
There have been four problems with the past reforms: (i)
timing, (ii)
implementation, (iii)
financing, and (iv) adequacy o f the reform package. The timing problem i s that many o f the
reforms have costs in the short run and benefits in the future. This i s the case for the pension
reform and education reform, among others. The implementation o f the reforms has not always
been as satisfactory as hoped (see Annex F). In some cases, political decisions have made
reforms more costly than expected, or have taken away potential sources o f financing for them
(for example, failure to use capitalization proceeds to reduce pension reform costs). The timing
and implementation problems have contributed to the difficulty o f financing the complete
package o f reforms. In retrospect, there does not seem to have been an adequate j o b by either the
governments or the donor community3 o f adding up the costs o f simultaneously carrying out
Bolivia’s comprehensive package o f reforms. Adding to the problems o f financing were overly
optimistic estimates o f growth. When the expected growth rates did not materialize, the costs o f
the extensive reforms began to place an increasingly unsupportable burden on government
finances. Finally, while there was a comprehensive package o f reforms, one particular type o f
reform that i s conspicuous in i t s absence i s a reform to reduce the microeconomic constraints to
growth. Indeed, outside o f a general attention to the regulatory environment, there has been less
emphasis on developing the productive sector than on ensuring macro stability, promoting
political institutionality, and developing the social sectors. Without growth, over time the social
and institutional reforms w i l l prove to be unaffordable for a country as poor as Bolivia.
E. Role of Intemational Assistance
33.
In addition to being known for i t s reforms, Bolivia i s known as a country that receives
high levels o f external assistance. As with the role o f reforms, one cannot refute the statement
that the international assistance has not been able to prevent Bolivia from falling into i t s current
difficulties. T o some extent, the build-up o f the strong trends in the economic, social, and
political arena has been obscured-first b y faith in reforms, initial years o f democracy, and years
o f some reasonable levels o f growth-then by a focus on a poverty reduction strategy that
perhaps placed too much emphasis on the task o f assigning HlpC resources.
34.
Bolivia’s participation in the HIPC program has helped maintain poverty-oriented
expenditure, but has not helped address the increasing fiscal deficit problems. The debt relief
substitutes expenditure for repayment o f debt for expenditure on poverty-oriented programs.
However, i t does not address the problem o f expenditures in total being greater than income.
35.
The international assistance has helped Bolivia maintain overall levels o f investment by
increasing i t s level o f assistance to compensate for the virtual collapse o f private domestic
investment. Indeed, the response b y the donor community probably goes a long way to explain
why Bolivia has not experienced negative rates o f growth (as many other Latin American
countries have), despite being hit b y sizable external shocks.

36.
The benefits o f the international assistance have come at a cost o f generating dependence.
External resources now account for one-third o f all public expenditure. The inescapable
3. Donor community refers to both bilateral and multilateral agencies.

9

conclusion i s that the size o f the government now exceeds the ability o f the domestic economy to
support it. This dependence should diminish over time, but currently i s difficult to do so. Just as
with the fiscal deficit, what i s needed i s a path o f international assistance over the future that i s
economically, politically, and socially viable.
37.
In the meantime, there are certainly actions that could be taken immediately to make the
development assistance more effective. International assistance remains fragmented and
dispersed, even after the introduction o f the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF).
While there have been some positive effects with the introduction o f the C D F (with better
coordination in a few programs and a general acceptance o f CDF principles), there has not been
enough change in the normal business practices of the different agencies. The high level o f
assistance remains one o f the most important assets the country has to help pull itself out o f i t s
current difficulties. Further efforts to follow through on implementation o f the C D F principles
would certainly help the government make more effective use o f this asset.

F. Latin American Context
38.
The recent turmoil in Bolivia i s not occurring in a vacuum. The impatience with the slow
pace o f poverty reduction and reduction in inequality, skepticism about the ability o f the
Washington Consensus to deliver the goods, disenchantment with traditional political leaders,
the increasing appeal o f simple but erroneous policy prescriptions o f populism, and the growth o f
indigenous movements are trends occurring in the Andean region, and perhaps in other regions
as well.

111. GOVERNMENT
STRATEGY
A. Time Horizon for the Mesa Govemment

39.
The government o f President Mesa that took over in a constitutional transition on
October 17, 2003 following the forced resignation o f Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has moved
quickly to formulate i t s plans. The plans have been formulated to cover two periods: (i)
a first
phase-from the present to the planned completion o f a Constitutional Assembly (expected to
take between 14 and 18 months), and (ii)
a second phase-from the end o f the Constitutional
Assembly to the end o f the constitutional term o f the President (that is, until August 6, 2007).
One o f the casualties o f the recent disturbances has been a shortening o f what i s considered the
medium term. Whereas prior to the social conflict o f October, the government was preparing i t s
revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) to cover a medium-term period up to 2015,
today the medium term i s considered to be the period up to 2007.

40.
I f the current Constitution were followed, the only way in which President Mesa would
not serve out the remaining presidential t e r m would be if he were to resign, in which case the
president o f the Senate would then call for new elections. However, as part o f the upcoming
Constitutional Assembly, the rules o f the game could change and (among other possible changes)
the Constitutional Assembly could call for new elections, whether President Mesa wished to
resign or not.

10

41.
There i s s t i l l a risk that social conflict could erupt again (around February/March 2004).
Some opposition groups have given President Mesa a limited time to resolve problems before
launching another round o f social conflict. I t i s clear that the demands cannot be met in the
allotted time frame. It remains to be seen whether the Mesa government can meet enough o f the
previously unfulfilled demands to keep social peace. Alternatively, the Mesa administration may
be able to convince the general public (and those threatening more social conflict) that the
actions that the government i s carrying out are substantive, even i f they do not match exactly the
original demands. I f so, the Mesa administration may be given the time and social peace to
allow i t to carry out i t s agenda.
B. Objectives during the First Phase
During the first phase, the government w i l l be pursuing the following three political
42.
objectives :
0
0
0

Revising the hydrocarbons law;
Submitting the decision to export natural gas to a public referendum; and
Calling for a Constitutional Assembly to modify the existing Constitution.

43.
An important element o f the government strategy i s to tackle these three issues in
sequence. The first difficult task i s to revise the hydrocarbons law. There i s a strong perception
among the general public that Bolivia did not get a fair deal from the existing gas contracts under
the capitalization process4, because the companies were able to move expenditures and income in
such a way as to minimize taxes. This perception was one o f the strong factors fueling
opposition to the gas export projects during the conflicts o f October 2003. President Mesa would
build political credibility (and also needed tax revenue) if he could increase the government
"take" on hydrocarbons. This would have to be done in consensus with o i l and gas companies to
avoid negative reputation effects that would result from unilateral action on the part o f the
government. There i s some potential for success in this effort because the gas companies may
take the long-term view that some concessions are needed in order to make future gas exports
viable.
44.
I f the outcome with the revision o f the hydrocarbons law i s successful, the government
would have more political weight to put behind a positive vote to export gas. I t i s essential that
the general public perceives that the government will act in the best interests o f the poor and
excluded in setting the terms o f the agreements on gas exports, especially given the failure o f
past exploitation o f vast reserves o f silver and tin to benefit the poor. The issue o f gas i s viewed
as being o f such high stakes because the poor see gas as their last chance to take advantage o f
rich natural resources. I t i s not entirely clear at this state what the wording w i l l be in the
referendum. Bolivia already exports gas. Past opposition has been to future proposals to export
gas through Chile. The previous administration was not able to convince the poor and excluded
4. Under the leadership o f President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when President in 1993-97, the Bolivian
government provided a helping hand to the nation's economy using Capitalization," a unique approach
involving the private sector through which strategic partners make investments in public enterprises in exchange
for management control. At the same time, government interest in the capitalization enterprises i s used to
finance pensions for i t s citizens 65 years and older. B y 1996 capitalizations had been completed in electricity,
telecommunications, aviation, railways and hydrocarbons.

11

that i t was worlung to defend their interests. I t remains to be seen whether this administration
w i l l be more successful. The recent agreement that Indonesia made to supply gas to California
w i l l complicate Bolivia’s search for markets, but may make i t more likely that a positive vote on
the Gas Referendum w i l l be obtained.

45.
Finally, if the government i s successful in managing the first two activities, i t could be in
a sufficiently strong position to manage the Constitutional Assembly. There are some
deficiencies in the current Constitution that could conceivably be improved through the
Constitutional Assembly. Three potential improvements would be: (i)
to improve the selection
process o f electing the President to reduce incentives to trade votes for political patronage; (ii)
to
allow representatives to be elected without the requirement that they be members of national
political parties; and (iii)
to clarify issues related to regional autonomy. However, conducting a
Constitutional Assembly under the current climate o f uncertainty i s a highly risky undertaking
because, once the Assembly i s convened, i t would have the power to change anything in the
Constitution. While there had been some support for a Constitutional Assembly in the last
several years, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada resisted these calls until the last days o f his
administration. Once he publicly agreed to call the Constitutional Assembly (two days before
the change), i t became politically impossible for President Mesa to go back on that agreement,
even if he had wanted to.
46.
In addition to the three political objectives, the govemment w i l l be attempting to achieve
the following three economic objectives:
0
0

Restoring macroeconomic stability;
Reorienting some public expenditure toward high-visibility programs that respond to
underlying factors that led to social conflict, especially in sensitive geographical areas;
and
Re-launching the institutional reform program and anticorruption efforts.

47.
The government’s economic team i s placing considerable emphasis on restoring
macroeconomic stability, which i s important given all other potential signals of instability. T o
restore macroeconomic stability, the government w i l l have to chart a projected path o f the fiscal
deficit that i s economically, socially, and politically feasible. That the fiscal deficit w i l l have to
be reduced i s clear to most observers, but not necessarily to all groups in Bolivia. H o w far and
how fast the fiscal deficit w i l l have to fall depends to a large extent on the availability o f external
financing and, in particular, on the availability o f donations and concessional financing.
48.
While macroeconomic stability i s necessary, i t i s clearly not sufficient for Bolivia.
Highly visible actions need to be taken to begin to address some o f the underlying problems
behind the social conflict. There needs to be a sense o f urgency to the task because frustration
with the pace o f poverty reduction and with actions to reduce inequality are generating a
dangerous dynamic. Social conflict and further deterioration in the ability o f the economic
system to generate growth could continue to feed o f f each other and send Bolivia into a
downward spiral. The govemment w i l l be launching some efforts to address the problems in the
next several months, with further efforts t o be undertaken as part o f the revised PRSP.
49.
The third major priority i s to relaunch the institutional reform process that stagnated
under the Sanchez de Lozada administration. Carlos Mesa was brought in as vice president to be
the champion for institutional reform and anticorruption efforts, but was widely viewed as

12

blocked b y the coalition members from acting. The country wants to see what President Mesa i s
preparedto do now that he i s not constrained as before.

50.
The six priorities address some of the economic, political, and social problems in a
holistic fashion. These priorities w i l l have to be augmented by additional activities supporting a
medium-term vision that w i l l be dealt with in the process o f revising the PRSP.
C. Objectivesfor the Second Phase
51.
The second phase o f the Mesa administration would begin once the Constitutional
Assembly ends. By the beginning o f the second phase, the government would hope to have: (i)
passed the potentially divisive processes o f the Gas Referendum and the Constitutional
Assembly with sufficient internal cohesion to maintain social peace and to move forward to
solve problems o f inequality, exclusion and poverty; (ii)
formulated a revised Poverty Reduction
Strategy, having passed a period o f consultation with civil society; (iii)
instituted a fiscal pact,
where civil society would recognize the difficult fiscal situation and would be agreeable to
measures designed to raise revenue in a progressive way and to moderate growth in expenditure,
particularly in the wage bill; and (iv) adjusted the portfolio o f international assistance so as to
make past reforms financially sustainable and so as to be aligned with the revised PRSP.
52.
T o arrive at that desired outcome w i l l require preparatory work that must begin before the
Constitutional Assembly ends. The government has already begun the process to revise the
PRSP. The starting point for the revisions i s the document presented at the October 2003
Consultative Group meeting. This document was structured around three strategic areas: (i)
productive development o f micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii)
social development
of a minimum set o f services; and (iii)social exclusion and cross-cutting public policies. In
addition, the document presents what are termed implementation commitments to ensure
institutional sustainability, fiscal sustainability and participation and dialogue. Finally, the
document considers resource allocation and financial requirements to achieving the targets in the
revised PRSP and discusses how the government would propose to move forward with a greater
results orientation.
A series o f consultations w i l l take place to revise the PRSP under the direction o f a
53.
National Directory consisting o f representatives from the government, the National Mechanism
o f Social Control, key organizations o f indigenous peoples, women’s organizations, associations
of municipalities the parliament, organizations representing small and medium enterprises and
organizations representing medium to large firms. A technical secretariat has also been formed
to help organize the consultation process. The current plan i s to proceed with the National
a pre-dialogue until the end o f January 2004 mainly to discuss
Dialogue 2003 in four stages: (i)
the nature o f the problems facing Bolivia; (ii)a Municipal Dialogue from the middle o f
February 2004 to the end o f March 2004, where the focus would be on developing strategies for
productive sector activities that could be implemented at the municipal level; (iii)
a Departmental
Dialogue from the beginning o f April to the 20th o f April; and (iv) a National Dialogue that
would take place the last 10 days o f April. At this final stage, proposals for the revised PRSP
and modifications, i f necessary, to the National Dialogue Law, the law which formalized the
conclusions o f the National Dialogue 2000, would be presented formally to President Mesa.
54.
The development o f the fiscal pact w i l l be done in coordination with the National
Dialogue 2003. For the fiscal pact to be successful, i t w i l l be necessary for the public to have

13

adequate information about the nature o f the fiscal problems facing the country. In visits that the
World Bank made to different regions to discuss the CAS, i t was clear that most people and most
institutions participating in the meetings did not have this information.

55.
The government plans to work closely with the donor community to bring about needed
changes to the overall portfolio. This w i l l be done in conjunction with a follow-up to the High
Level Forum on Harmonization held in Rome in February 2003 and with an overall effort to
align donor assistance to the PRSP.

56.
Despite the overall uncertainty prevailing in Bolivia at this moment, moving quickly with
the process o f revising the PRSP makes sense. I f this process were to be delayed until after the
Constitutional Assembly, there might be a risk that those (understandingly) frustrated with the
slow pace o f poverty reduction would try to resolve the problems through rewriting the
Constitution rather than through the more reasonable approach o f setting short and medium-term
public policy. The PRSP provides direction to public policy and a focal point around which
international assistance could be organized. The World Bank continues to support strongly the
PRSP process.
57.
I t i s unlikely that the revised PRSP would be ready before July 2004-and
possibly later.
H o w aggressive the poverty reduction targets set forth in the revised PRSP can be depends on
future tax revenue, which, in turn, depends on the outcome o f the Gas Referendum. Since the
nature o f the country could change dramatically depending on the outcomes o f the Constitutional
Assembly, the nature o f the PRSP might also be expected to change as a consequence.
D. Risks and Opportunities in Implementing the Govemment ’s Strategy
While the government i s presenting a clear and reasonable strategy for moving forward,
58.
there are many r i s k s that have to be faced. Among the main risks are the following:
0

0

0

0

0

0

The Congress i s s t i l l controlled by traditional political parties. It i s not clear that they
w i l l be supportive of the administration’s agenda.
President Mesa could not serve out the remainder of the president’s constitutional term.
A new government could adopt policies that lead to further deterioration o f the economic
situation. A new government could enjoy less support than that o f President Mesa.
Strong demands are being placed on the government from many different sectors, but the
government has limited ability to respond. Dissatisfaction with the government’s
response could trigger a new round o f social conflict.
While some groups genuinely would like to see their demands met, there are several
groups that have l i t t l e interest in demands being met and would prefer to see the
government fail and fall. They would be willing to work actively to try to bring this
about.
The banking and financial sector remains fragile.
M u c h o f the public has disdain for the concept o f a budget constraint. They want their
demands met now, yet there i s a reluctance to pay taxes. Part o f the reluctance to pay
taxes i s due to perceived corruption .and to the perception that they are not getting
services, but merely paying for salaries o f government officials.
There i s considerable uncertainty surrounding the level o f foreign assistance that w i l l be
forthcoming-particularly in the critical area o f donations from bilaterals.

14

There i s likely to be resistance from some o i l and gas companies to renegotiating the
hydrocarbons law.
Achieving success in the political agenda requires each o f the three steps to be successful.
There i s a less than 100-percent probability o f success in each individual step, and the
probability o f achieving all three i s considerably lower than the probability o f achieving
any single outcome.
Regional tensions within the country are rising.
I t i s unclear what direction the coca eradication campaign w i l l take at this time. While
the program i s important, an aggressive push might raise the overall level o f tension and
conflict in the country.
There are growing demands for land issues to be resolved, and some groups are pursuing
a strategy o f land invasions. Controlling land invasions has the potential to escalate into
armed conflict.
The administration may start to lose i t s focus as different ministers start to push their own
sectoral agenda. As a result, the administration may depart from the good practices o f
successful transition governments to do a few things well.
The implementation capacity at different levels of government i s weak-particularly in
municipalities and prefectures. I t i s also weak in some ministries. I t has been weak in
the Fondo de Znversidn Productiva y Social (FPS), although there have been recent
improvements. I t remains weak in the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional.
Under the difficult country circumstances, i t i s likely that both domestic and foreign
private investment w i l l be l o w in the near term, making i t difficult to sustain growth.
Virtually any result could come out o f the Constitutional Assembly, and i t w i l l be
difficult for the government to manage the agenda. I t w i l l be easier to manage if
President Mesa gains prestige and popularity as a result o f successes with the
modification o f the hydrocarbons law and a successful outcome o f the Gas Referendum.

As with all crises, along with the risks come opportunities. The main opportunities are as
follows:
With the traditional parties absent from the government, there should now be greater
political w i l l to move on institutional reform.
President Mesa i s a strong communicator and enjoys a reasonable level o f popularity and
support internally and externally.
The new government has a clear strategy, at least for the initial phase-with strong
interest in sticking to a solid macro-framework supported by an agreement with the IMF.
There i s a new opportunity to achieve agreement on gas.
The Constitutional Assembly could clarify decentralization policy and questions o f
regional autonomy. I t could introduce measures to strengthen representative democracy.
There i s now a more favorable external economic environment with the improvements in
the economies o f Brazil and Argentina.
Bolivia has recovered most o f i t s competitiveness with respect to Brazil and Argentina as
a result of the accelerated pace o f depreciation the Central Bank has put in place over the
last two and a half years.

Bolivia has access to U.S. markets for some products through the Andean Trade
Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). Foreign investors may want to locate
to Bolivia, if social peace could be assured, to take advantage of Bolivia’s preferential
access to markets.
There i s a possibility that the government could successfully increase tax revenues
toward the end o f the first phase. This relies on a strategic sequencing of events. If
negotiations on the hydrocarbons law result in an increase in government tax revenues
from transnationals, this may provide an opening for more demands to be made for
domestic f i r m s and wealthier individuals to increase their tax contributions.

Iv. WORLD BANKGROUPSTRATEGY
60.
The World Bank Group Strategy i s to establish a plan o f assistance for two years, FY04
and FY05, that roughly covers the first phase o f the government strategy. During this CAS
period, the Bank would provide a concrete package o f financial assistance and rapid technical
assistance to support what the Bank believes i s a sound approach to the current difficulties facing
the country. A new CAS would be prepared to cover FY06 and beyond, when i t i s likely that the
outcome o f the Constitutional Assembly would be known. Provided there i s a viable economic,
political, and social arena in which the Bank can be effective, the Bank would be prepared to
work on a comprehensive program that would include further initiatives to address inequality
and lack of income generation for the poor. I f i t proves extremely difficult to operate, the Bank
would limit i t s activities to basic investments in infrastructure and the social sectors.

A. Level of Assistance, Mix between I D A and IBRD
61.
Before entering into a detailed discussion o f the assistance to be provided over the two
distinct phases, i t i s important to note the parameters that w i l l govern the amount o f assistance
the Bank can provide. The proposed financial resources to be provided to Bolivia are up to
US$lOO million a year in the base case scenario, up to U S $ l 5 0 million a year in the high case
scenario, and approximately US$45 million a year in the low case scenario. The proposed level
o f assistance in the base case would be sufficient to support an average o f four projects and four
pieces o f Economic and Sector Work (ESW) per year during 2004-05.
62.
Because Bolivia’s gross national income (GNI) per capita i s projected to fall below the
International Development Agency (IDA) cutoff and to remain below that cutoff for several
years, Bank management proposes to delay graduation o f Bolivia from IDA, and for Bolivia to
remain a blend country through the end o f the IDA 14 cycle. In the low case scenario, Bolivia
would be provided access only to IDA, while in both the base and high case scenarios Bolivia
would receive a blend of IDA and IB’RDresources.
63.
Bolivia initially received an allocation for FY 03-05 consistent with a previously agreed
plan for graduation at the end o f IDA 13. Along with the proposal to delay graduation, Bank
management has recalculated Bolivia’s IDA 13 allocation on the full performance-based
allocation, rather than the reduced amount assigned assuming graduation. Based on this
recalculation and taking into account the resources used in FY03, Bolivia’s remaining IDA
allocation under IDA13 for FY04 and FY05 i s US$85 million. Continued IDA access during
FY06-07 i s subject to further discussion and determination during the I D A 1 4 negotiations.

16

64.
It i s important to assess whether Bolivia could afford to contract the proposed amounts
without running into difficulties o f debt sustainability. T o answer that question, the Bank carried
out a detailed analysis o f Bolivia’s debt sustainability based on several scenarios-with and
without revenues from the export o f natural gas, with an aggressive fiscal adjustment that could
be politically difficult to achieve, and with a less aggressive fiscal adjustment that may be
politically and socially more viable. Scenarios without fiscal adjustment have been analyzed. as
well, but they are clearly not sustainable, so their results w i l l not be presented here.5

65.
The results o f the different scenarios are summarized in Table 3. The baseline scenario
assumes that there w i l l be a positive vote on the Gas Referendum, but that the gas project w i l l
not start until 2008, with exports coming on line three years later in 2011. The baseline scenario
with gas and a less aggressive fiscal adjustment i s the most viable scenario in economic, political
and social terms. However, i t does present a problem o f increasing domestic debt. In this
baseline scenario fiscal sustainability would be strengthened if additional donations or
concessional credits are made available to reduce the implied path o f domestic debt. The
scenario without gas and with less aggressive adjustment i s not fiscally sustainable. Without gas,
the situation i s sustainable only under the assumption o f an aggressive fiscal adjustment. With
gas and an aggressive fiscal adjustment makes the situation economically most sustainable, but at
a cost o f the political and social viability.

66.
Another important conclusion drawn from empirical results i s that the composition o f
World Bank lending between IDA and IBRD financing doesn’t affect fiscal sustainability results.
Details o f the calculations under the baseline scenarios and results under alternative scenarios are
presented in Annex C.
5. The debt sustainability exercise was prepared by World Bank staff building on technical consultations with
Bolivian authorities. The exercise i s based on loan-by-loan data provided by the authorities and creditors. The
external debt outstanding i s as o f end-2002, and includes the debt relief provided under the HIPC, enhanced
HIPC Initiatives, and beyond HIPC. Data on the public sector’s domestic debt employed i s as of December 31,
2002, and has been provided by the Treasury. Information on new external disbursements has been provided by
the Central Bank. Once all identified external financial flows are taken into account, i t i s assumed that the
private sector obtains additional financing from the external private sector (at commercial terms) to close the
external accounts. To close the fiscal gap, the government i s assumed to sell US$-denominated 3-year bonds
and 15-year treasury bills (to Administrudoru de Fondo de Pensiones [AFPs]). I t i s assumed that this
government paper i s held by the private sector andor b y the monetary sector.

17

67.
To take into account the uncertainty of having a baseline scenario that assumes a positive
vote on the Gas Referendum, the Bank performed a Monte Carlo simulation on the trends o f the
public debt to GDP ratio with different assumed starting dates for the gas project. The
simulation exercise assigns a uniform probability to the gas project starting between 2005 and
2035 and then introduces further uncertainty in the assumptions o f the real GDP growth,
devaluation and inflation6 Forecast confidence intervals are generated that estimate the
likelihood o f the future situation o f the public debt of Bolivia based on the distribution of
assumed values o f the key economic variables.
68.
The results in Figure 5 indicate with 90 percent confidence probability that, assuming a
progressive fiscal adjustment, the ratio o f nominal stock o f public debt to GDP (at 67.8 percent
o f GDP in 2003) shows a tendency to contract from 2006 onwards. This trend follows the sudden
increase associated with the high levels o f deficits expected for the coming years (2003-05). In
the worst cases, this ratio would not decrease to current levels but would stabilize close to 75
percent o f GDP.
69.
T w o additional scenarios were analyzed to take into account two immediate concerns
about the economy: (i)
the possible inability to attain a progressive fiscal adjustment (Scenario
5); and (ii)
the effects o f a financial crisis (Scenario 6). Both scenarios adopt the pessimistic
assumption that the gas project would not materialize at all. Figure 6 illustrates the results of
Scenario 5: where the service o f domestic debt becomes such a heavy burden for fiscal accounts
that by 2008 the ratio o f nominal stock to GDP enters in an unstable exploding path. Due to
liquidity and solvency difficulties in the medium-term this scenario i s clearly fiscal
unsustainable. The results o f Scenario 6 are only presented in Annex C; they l i e between the
results o f Scenarios 5 and 3.

6. Normal Probability Distributions for real output growth, inflation and devaluation were specified based on the
analysis o f historical data. In the case o f real output growth (e.g. an average o f 3.6 and a standard deviation o f
1.7 were assumed-3.6 percent was the real output growth average for the 1990-2002 period). Some autocorrelation has been introduced to take into account inertia in the evolution o f these variables. Similarly,
correlations between growth, inflation and devaluation were also introduced. The assumptions o f the simulation
exercise rules out a major economic crisis, say triggered by a financial or major social unrest. We have
evaluated how results vary when the probability determining the scenario with gas or without gas; simulation
outcomes indicate that the results does not change qualitatively nor significantly if the gas scenario has a bit
more or a bit less chance to occur.
7. Starting from the assumptions o f Scenario 3 (without gas), Scenario 5 assumes a permanent increase in current
expenditures o f 1 percent GDP from 2004 onwards to reflect the costs o f a potential financial crisis. I t i s also
assumed that the long term output growth rate i s reduced by 0.5 percentage points. Because o f the uncertainty
environment assumed, external capital flows, especially o f FDI are reduced as well. Export levels due to low
investment levels are also reduced. Scenario 5 maintains the baseline-scenario-levels o f external financing
which implies that public debt growth i s explained essentially by an increase in domestic debt.

B. The Case for Postponing IDA Graduation

70.
The case for postponing IDA graduation until the end of the I D A 14 Cycle i s based on
the recent performance o f Bolivia's GNI per capita. As shown in Figure 7, since 1999 this
indicator i s converging toward levels below IDA cutoff limits. Moreover, there i s a considerable
probability that Bolivia's GNI per capita w i l l fall under the actual I D A cutoff limit and stay
below the limit for a couple years. The Bank performed a Monte Carlo simulation o f the trends
in GNI per capita under different assumptions o f the rate of growth o f output, devaluation, and
inflation.8 The results in Figure 8 and Table 4 indicate that for 2004 and 2006 there i s a greater
than 50 percent chance that GNI w i l l fall below the IDA cutoff point. In later years, the
probability o f being below the cutoff point declines significantly.

Figure 8 shows the evolution o f GNI per capita, together with corresponding confidence
intervals that are calculated based on the Monte Carlo simulations.

8. Normal Probability distributions for real output growth, inflation, and devaluation were specified, based on the
analysis o f historical data. In the case o f real output growth, for example, an average o f 3.6 and a standard
deviation o f 1.7 were assumed (3.6 average for 1990-2002). Some autocorrelation has been introduced to take
account o f certain inertia components in the evolution o f time series. Similarly, correlations between growth,
inflation, and devaluation have also been introduced.

Note: The IDA per capita income operational cutoff i s updated annually. GNI per capita of calendar year t has to be

compared with the cutoff corresponding to the fiscal year t+2.

72.
Compounding the past negative trends in GNI per capita, Bolivia is entering into a period
o f increased uncertainty. For these two reasons, Bank management believes a postponement o f
IDA graduation until after the IDA 14 cycle i s warranted.
C. Triggers for Different Lending Scenarios

73.
Table 5 presents the triggers that would move the lending program either down to the low
case, or up to the high case. Reviews o f the triggers would take place at the end o f June 2004
and at the end of December 2004. During these evaluations, to make a judgment on whether
macroeconomic conditions are worsening or improving, the Bank w i l l review key short term
macroeconomic targets included as quantitative performance criteria in the government's
economic program supported by the IMF arrangement. T o complement these short-term
indicators, the Bank w i l l also evaluate recent trends (over the last 24 months) and medium- and
long-term prospects (over the next two to three years) o f specific economic and financial
indicators such as fiscal balances, short-term to total debt ratio, total debt to GDP ratio and NIR
(as number of weeks in terms o f imports o f goods). The combination o f specific quantitative
indicators, trends and prospects would provide a solid basis for making informed assessments
over changes in macroeconomic conditions.

increased expenditure pressures threatened fiscal and debt sustainability and economic growth.
The deterioration in the macroeconomic framework would imply that there would be no IMFfunded program in place, and that there would be no BanWIDA adjustment lending, and no
IBRD lending.

years.
Prepare either a Second Programmatic Bank and Corporate Sector

Work with all donors on meeting projected fiscal deficit gap for 2004. Try to

how high-impact expenditures can be prioritized and lower-impact
expenditures cut.
Support Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) to help government
calculate ex ante the likely effects o f possible changes to try to restore
macroeconomic stability.
These actions represent an immediate response. However, i t i s necessary to reflect
on how Bolivia got into this precarious fiscal problem. It would appear that past
reforms have been woefully underfunded and were financially sustainable only
under assumptions o f high growth rates and under the assumption that when faced
with a difficult political decision, the authorities would always take the decision
that limited the costs o f reforms. Both assumptions were unrealistic. The nature o f
the problem has to be universally recognized and corrective actions are needed.
Budgetary support i s needed not for new reforms, but to make previous reforms
financially sustainable. Bolivia has had to make major increases in expenditures
over the last several years to support these reforms. For example, i t raised teacher
salaries 60 percent in real terms in the last 10 years and now approaches the
benchmark recommended by the World Bank. Other countries are receiving
Education For All (EFA) Fast Track resources to achieve this, while Bolivia has
financed t h i s out o f current income. Similarly, Bolivia financed all o f the transition
costs o f the pension reform out o f current income. These costs have caught up with
the country. At the same time, individual donors have financed new initiatives
when the cost o f existing reforms i s now revealed not to be fully covered.
Modifications to how donor assistance i s delivered i s needed, and the World Bank
could play a leading role in convincing other donors what the underlying dynamics
that led to the fiscal problems are and what corrective actions need to be taken. The
PER i s the most effective vehicle the Bank has for bringing these issues t o the
table.

first three months o f 2004. T h i s includes three projects that are proposed for FY04, described
below.

78.
EMERGENCY
ECONOMIC
RECOVERY
PROJECT
(EERP). This U S 1 4 million IDA project
has been presented to the Board in December 2003. The EERP provided quick disbursing
financing against a positive l i s t o f imports in order to assist the Government o f Bolivia to
continue provision o f public social services and sustain existing economic and social recovery
programs.
79.
FIRSTPROGRAMMATICBANKAND CORPORATESECTOR RESTRUCTURING
PROJECT.This
w i l l be presented to the Board in February 2004 along with the CAS. The project would provide
US$15 million o f IDA and US$15 million o f IBRD financing. The govemment's program
supported by this operation focuses on strengthening and restructuring the financial and
corporate sectors in the context o f difficult political and macroeconomic conditions. The
program involves four main components: (i)
enhancing organizational arrangements to manage
systemic bank corporate restructuring, (ii)
achieving legal clarity and appropriate distribution o f
financial sector regulatory powers, (iii)strengthening prudential regulation and the bank
resolution framework, and (iv) improving the institutional framework for corporate restructuring,
including through broadening the diagnosis o f the corporate sector and i t s interrelations with
banks. The program has been designed to strengthen the overall system and not the financial
interests o f the owners o f the banks or o f the corporations, by assigning losses first to those that
undertook the riskier activities while limiting the use o f public resources.

80.
The implementation o f this program i s crucial not only to strengthen the financial and
corporate sectors, but also for the overall program o f Bank assistance to Bolivia (see Table 5).
Indeed, failure to implement specific actions w i l l contribute to move the overall lending program
to the low case. These actions include, inter alia, the issuing o f regulations by the
Superintendency o f Bank and Financial Institutions (SBEF) to upgrade consolidated supervision
and to make loan classification more consistent with international standards, and the SBEF
ensuring the full capitalization o f financial institutions included in the reform program. In
contrast, accelerating the implementation o f these specific actions, advancing the reform
program, and reducing the systemic risks o f the financial sector w i l l contribute to move Bolivia
to the high case lending scenario.
81.
SOCIAL SECTOR PROGRAMMATICCREDIT.
This US$20 million IDA project i s proposed to
be presented in June 2004. I t would be designed to ensure that previous advances in health,
education and water and sanitation are maintained, and to ensure that Bolivia would be
positioned to accelerate progress on MDGs once current economic, political, and social
difficulties are overcome. Particular attention would be paid to reducing inequality in education,
health and water and sanitation outcomes across municipalities, ethnic groups, and income
classes. If during preparation Bolivia moves forward in revising i t s PRSP, i t would be possible
to convert this credit into a PRSC. If little progress i s made in the PRSP because o f the difficult
situation, the Bank could s t i l l go forward with the Programmatic Social Sector Credit. Both
projects would be f ast-di sbursing adjustment credits.
82.
Five projects are proposed for FY05. Two projects, the Land Reform Project and the
Spatial Sustainable Development Project, respond directly to the problems o f inequality and to
the problems that the poor have in generating income. One project, the possible Second
Programmatic Bank and Corporate Restructuring Loan or the Fiscal Adjustment Loan, responds
to problems o f maintaining macroeconomic stability. One project, the Second Institutional
Reform Project, would help the government relaunch i t s institutional reform and anti-corruption
programs, one o f the current high priorities. The fifth project, the Secondary Education Project,

25

does not respond to an immediate short-term priority, but i s necessary and important to allow the
country to continue with i t s successful ongoing Education Reform program. The Education
Reform i s one o f the few government programs that could be considered truly a state policy, as i t
has been supported across several different administrations.

83.
LAND
REFORMPROJECT. The major issue in land reform i s that the process o f land titling
and regularization has advanced too slowly. After six years o f implementation o f the Znstituto
Nucional de Reformu Agruriu (INRA) Law, many fewer titles have been issued and too few
hectares have been redistributed than expected. Around 4,000 titles have been provided to
property owners and six million hectares have been regularized, yet there are around 8,000 titles
that remain mired in the bureaucratic process and over 24 million hectares in process o f
regularization. As a result, new demands for Tierrus Communiturius de Origen (TCO) titles
have arisen from indigenous communities in the highlands. A landless movement demanding
greater equity and improved access to land by the poor has also arisen.
84.
The process o f land redistribution i s generating social unrest. Because the amount o f land
being reverted to the State i s limited, there i s little new land available for redistribution.
Similarly, land suitable for agricultural settlement or livestock activities i s very limited. There
have been reductions in rural property taxes that have served as a disincentive for redistributive
transactions and the rational use o f the land. In addition, proper operation o f the property registry
i s hampered by needless institutional complexity and lack o f policy definitions regarding
multiple uses o f the registry. The slow pace o f progress and the adverse incentives for a more
rational use o f land are some o f the issues that w i l l be tackled in the upcoming land reform
project.

85.
SPATIAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT. This project would support: (i)
local
development planning, (ii)
organizational support to producers and service providers, and (iii)
the development o f new mechanisms to finance economic development. In this line, the Bank
would support productive development initiatives that w i l l be prepared by the producers, in
response to local economic development plans. This project complements the Participatory
Rural Investment Project and the Decentralization PSAC, but emphasizes community
participation and producer’s needs.
86.
This project would help address some o f the great differences that exist in Unmet Basic
Needs (UBN) between regions and the increasing divergence in economic outcomes across
regions. I t i s worrisome that differences in UBN are deepening in spite o f government programs
promoting greater decentralization. An initial analysis o f UBN variation between municipalities
in the period 1992-2001 shows that there are close to 80 municipalities in which the proportion
o f the population with unsatisfied basic needs has increased.’ Overall, the rate increased in 5
departments (Chuquisaca, Cochabamba, Tarija, Santa Cruz and Pando) and actually diminished
in 4 others (La Paz, Oruro, Potosi and Beni). The case o f Potosi i s particularly dramatic since
the rate for the latter period i s close to zero (0.09 percent per year). This growing divergence,
mirroring that between urban and rural areas, signals the partial failure of equalization policies
implemented through decentralization and sector reforms. Thus, the difference o f 41.7 percent in
the proportion of population with unmet basic needs between Santa Cruz and Potosi signals a
country becoming increasingly polarized.
9. This initial distribution seems to reflect in particular variations in the provision o f health services, which may
be partly due to measuring factors.

26

87.
In spite o f the growing importance o f agricultural exports from some lowland areas,
economic growth has followed an enclave pattern, with highly capital-intensive investment in a
few sectors (mostly hydrocarbons) and little effect in rural areas due to the small growth in
employment and in demand for agricultural products. This pattern has been reinforced b y the
opening o f the Bolivian economy and the incapacity of most food farmers (i.e. mostly peasant
farmers) to compete with cheap imports. The rural economy i s being increasingly polarized
between a peasant sector, mostly dedicated to food production, and an “entrepreneurial” farm
sector mostly dedicated to the production o f export cash crops. A study o f 40 communities in the
Bolivian highlands” confirmed that within the peasant sector close to 80 percent o f producers
were caught in a vicious cycle o f agricultural intensification, land degradation and diminishing
income. Significantly, 20 percent o f the farmers in the sector had managed to break out o f this
negative cycle and showed improvements in productivity and income even in the Altiplano,
showing that ecosystemic characteristics did not represent absolute limitations to poverty
reduction, as i s often argued.”
SECOND PROGRAMMATIC BANKAND CORPORATE SECTOR RESTRUCTURING
PROGRAM OR
88.
FISCALADJUSTMENTLOAN.
Bank management would propose to present either one or the other
project. The decision on which loan to prepare would depend on the need for further bank and
corporate restructuring, on the effectiveness o f the measures included in the first programmatic
loan and on the type o f measures that the government might take to help bring about a fiscal
adjustment. If the Bank were to proceed with a fiscal adjustment loan, i t would be expected to
be informed by the results o f the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA), that the Bank i s
undertalung jointly with the government and the IMF as part o f the program o f ESW.

89.
SECOND INSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROJECT. The existing Institutional Reform project was
restructured to allow the government to meet i t s pressing fiscal needs in 2003. The new project
would be designed to support the Government’s new direction in institutional reform, possibly
including judicial reform. I t would also help support the government’s anti-comption program.
There i s active work in this area by other donors (Denmark, The Netherlands, Sweden, United
Kingdom among others). The first Institutional Reform Project was cofinanced with other
donors. I t i s expected that this would be as well. In fact, the Institutional Reform Program
supports Institutional Reform Agreements (ARI in Spanish) aimed at strengthening public sector
agencies. The first program supported the reform process in few agencies, including the Ministry
o f Finance, Agriculture, Housing and Education. The ARI lays out specific actions, such as full
operation o f integrated financial system, use o f budgeting b y results, and a functioning
performance evaluation system, indicated b y the publication o f annual evaluations to be
undertaken with the aim o f achieving measurable improvements in program effectiveness. The
implementation of ARI actions i s key to achieve an efficient public sector, and to the overall
Bank assistance program (see Table 5). Failure to comply with at least 75 percent o f the ARI
actions w i l l contribute to place Bolivia in the l o w case lending scenario, while compliance with
at least 90 percent o f the ARI actions will contribute to place Bolivia in the high case scenario.
90.
SECONDARY EDUCATIONPROJECT. This i s being proposed for FY05 because the
Education Reform Program has now reached the secondary level. This project i s also likely to
be cofinanced with other donors, building upon the close working relations among donors
10. Mas a l l i de las cifras. Viceministerio de Participacion Popular y Viceministerio de Desarrollo Rural. 1999.
11. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that some Altiplano farms manage to generate greater profits per area unit
than exporuoriented farms in the lowlands.

27

worlung in the eduction sector. The country needs assistance in formulating strategy and
financing investments in secondary education. A key element w i l l be managing the hiring o f
teachers for secondary education as secondary education i s expanded. Currently, studentteacher ratios are low at the primary level. Retraining excess primary teachers and placing them
in secondary schools could result in huge cost savings compared to the practice o f first hiring all
the secondary teachers and then realizing that the country cannot afford such an overall l o w
student-teacher ratio. The possibility o f carrying out this redeployment with minimal resistance
from a strong teacher union i s available only one time-when secondary education i s expanded.
91.
In summary, provided that Bolivia remains in the base case scenario, the projects that
would be prepared during FY04 and FY 05 would be as follows:

In addition to these projects, there are 15 projects in the existing portfolio that are at
different stages o f implementation (see Annex D). The original amount o f these credits was
US$592.2 million, and as o f November 24, 2003 there remained an undisbursed balance o f
US$286.6 million. In projects due to close on December 31, 2003 there i s an undisbursed
balance o f US$28.0 million. In projects due to close on June 30, 2004 there i s an undisbursed
balance o f US$103.2 million. In projects due to close after June 30, 2004 and before December
31, 2007 there i s an undisbursed balance o f US$155.4 million. Efforts w i l l be made with the
government to accelerate implementation o f this existing portfolio. As part o f i t s portfolio
management plan, the Bank i s planning to carry out an in-depth strategic review o f the portfolio
during the 3rd quarter o f FY04.

28

ESW for FY04
93.
In addition to the informal technical assistance related to the revision o f the hydrocarbons
law and to the information dissemination program, the World Bank w i l l present several pieces o f
formal ESW during the first phase.
94.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
REVIEW (PER). The PER, which i s being carried out jointly with
the Inter-American Development Bank, examines sources of recent fast expenditure increases,
the budget process, the sustainability o f social protection programs, and the equitability and
efficiency o f public sector service delivery in Bolivia. The ultimate goal o f the report i s to
provide policy recommendations to address Bolivia’s pressing public expenditure issues, to help
return Bolivia to a sustainable fiscal path, and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f
public services. The PER analysis indicates that (i)
pension costs and the wage bill have been
significant drivers o f fast expenditure growth in recent years; (ii)
there have been improvements
in the budget process in the context o f Bolivia’s PRSP, but much remains to be done to eliminate
sources o f soft budget constraints; (iii)
social protection outlays have increased in recent years
and are considered sustainable; and (iv) the HIPC initiatives have resulted in more equitable
delivery o f public services, although much remains to be done to reduce the inequality gap.
95.
Moreover, roughly 90 percent o f the amount of expenditure covered by domestic
resources (the rest being covered by external resources) i s viewed as “inflexible” (see Table 7),
resulting from salary costs associated with the (needed) expansion o f social services, debt service
costs, and pension reform costs.

96.
While these expenditures may be labeled as “inflexible,” if the level of external resources
decreases (or another crisis were to occur, and the donor community were not able to respond),

29

the country would have n o choice but to cut “inflexible” expenditures. Thus, i t would be prudent
to proactively map out a more sustainable expenditure pattern that-if i t does not result in
outright cuts-at least takes strong action to control the rate o f increase o f expenditure which has
been relatively high over the last several years relative to the country’s ability to generate
domestic resources. The PER provides some assistance in prioritizing expenditures to generate a
more sustainable path in the future.
97.
In addition to the worrisome growth o f public expenditures in recent years, the
sustainability o f reforms i s cause for concern. Bolivia’s reforms since the mid-1980s have been
supported through international cooperation. The financial sustainability o f these reforms i s in
some doubt. Given that some o f the reforms were designed to increase revenue, they have either
not realized as much revenue as expected or have met with resistance (e.g., the tax reform and
the civil service reform). The reforms that involve expenditures have proven to be more costly
than expected (e.g., pension reform), partly due to growth rate overestimations-a phenomenon
that characterized the whole Latin America region in the 1990s. These reform shortcomings
make i t imperative to rationalize public expenditures for the purposes o f achieving fiscal
sustainability .
98.
The PER also provides a good basis on which to organize all international assistance to
ensure financial sustainability o f existing reforms. Many o f the donor agencies’ plans are now
based on the assumption that past reforms are financially sustainable, and that future assistance
need only build upon solid past reforms. To ensure financial sustainability o f past reforms,
future assistance must be directed to put the reforms back on firmer financial footing. This
should be done in a participatory way-with other donors and the government.
99.
COUNTRY FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTABILITYASSESSMENT
(CFAA). The new CFAA,
currently underway, which i s being carried out jointly with the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), w i l l examine more closely the issues o f revenue management, the structure o f
internal controls and audits, the quality and periodicity o f government reporting, and the system
for tracking poverty reduction expenditures (including HIPC funds), and w i l l build upon the first
diagnostic study that was carried out in 1999. Additionally, the C F A A w i l l also examine the
rules and regulations (and their application) that govern fiscal decentralization and the absorptive
capacity at the local government level to adhere to standards. The C F A A w i l l be complemented
by the European Commission’s Compliance Test, which w i l l examine the quality of expenditures
within several sectors (and test the control systems within these sectors). The combination o f
both analytical works w i l l provide a full and robust picture o f the quality o f Bolivia’s Public
Financial Management (PFM) and w i l l result in a single set o f recommendations to further
strengthen the country’s public overall financial management.
100. POVERTY
ASSESSMENT.
In addition to normal diagnostic activities, there w i l l be an effort
to look at inequality and at factors that impede poor people’s ability to generate income. The
proposed Poverty Assessment complements recent analytical work on poverty conducted b y the
Bank with the Bolivian government. In 2000 the Bank prepared a poverty diagnostic report in
conjunction with the National Institute o f Statistics and Unidad de Andisis de Politicas
Econdmicas (UDAPE) as part o f the formulation of Bolivia’s PRSP, which presents a diagnostic
o f poverty and human development and analyzes the impact o f access to social infrastructure on
poverty. The 2000 report called for future work to focus on better understanding the
determinants o f growth and how i t could bear a bigger impact on the productive activities o f the
poor.

30

101. The Poverty Assessment w i l l undertake further investigation of the microconstraints to
firm growth and job creation, the sources o f distributional change, the dynamics of the labor
market and internal migration, and the identification o f the fine grid o f economic activities from
which the poor derived most o f their income and the main bottlenecks and market failures
affecting them.
102. EDUCATION
SECTOR STUDY. Since the passing o f the Education Reform law in 1994,
Bolivia has embarked on a path o f strong educational reforms that have been impressive in scope
and positive in yielding results. After an increase o f 22.7 percentage points in net enrollment
since 1990, universal primary enrollment i s very close to being achieved. For secondary
education, the results are also impressive: an increase o f 21.5 percentage points in six years. N o t
only did Bolivia improve educational results over time, i t also now does better than much o f
Latin America, particularly when per capita income i s controlled for.
103. These relatively positive results should not, however, be reason for complacency. The
educational reform process i s far from finished, since much o f the original plan remains to be
completed. In some areas, such as initial teacher training and evaluation systems, the reform
process appears to have advanced further, and in others, such as decentralization, i t appears to be
in a difficult middle-of-the-road position. Also, the positive results that are shown above are
themselves creating new challenges. For example, improvements in primary education access
and completion have brought about very sizeable increases in secondary school demand, which
must be quickly accommodated. The objective o f the Education Sector Study w i l l be to analyze
where Bolivia stands today in the path o f i t s education reform process and map out the
challenges that l i e ahead, all in order to improve student attainment and achievement to provide
for a better-educated population in Bolivia.
104. POVERTY
AND SOCIAL
IMPACT
ANALYSIS (PSIA). The PSIA consists essentially o f ex
ante analysis o f consequences o f policy changes. I t w i l l be particularly important in this period
o f uncertainty to carry out this type o f analysis. This work w i l l be carried out jointly with the
IMF and the government’s policy analysis unit, UDAPE. With World Bank and IMF assistance,
the government w i l l have in place greater capability to anticipate effects o f policy changes that
they might propose or that might be proposed by the opposition.

ESW for FY05
105. The proposed E S W program for FY05 would concentrate on issues related to growth,
especially the problems faced by the poor in generating income, and in policies that would help
Bolivia export. The major piece o f ESW would be a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
focusing on growth recovery and trade. Given that such a high percentage o f the economy in
Bolivia i s informal, the C E M would be complemented b y a labor and informal market study.
106. Because poverty has increased in urban areas over the last four years and because urban
areas have been at the center o f social unrest, the World Bank would carry our a City Poverty
Strategy. One of the topics that would be considered in this study i s whether the new rules for
fiscal transfers based on formulas have been adequate for those cities that receive a large number
o f migrants.
107. Three other potential pieces o f ESW would respond to current problems. One would be a
study on conflict analysis and resolution. Current practices o f resolving conflict are imposing

31

high costs on society and the economy and there may be better ways to resolve the conflicts.
The second study would analyze Bolivia’s Social Protection Framework. There are some
elements in place (e.g., the temporary employment program known as PLANE), but the overall
framework i s fragmented and could certainly be improved. The third, Subnational Government
Reform, would analyze emerging issues related to relations across different levels o f
government.

E. IFC Activities
108. In conjunction with the Bank support to growth, I F C w i l l continue to provide support for
private sector development over the next CAS period. IFC’s support w i l l focus on: (i)
monitoring o f the existing portfolio to ensure that IFC-financed projects could weather these
difficult times; (ii)
technical assistance and capacity building through a new regional Small- and
Medium-Enterprise ( S M E ) facility to strengthen small and medium enterprises and
microenterprises; and (iii)
selectively providing financing for viable, high impact projects in such
sectors as the hydrocarbons sector, infrastructure including power, the social sectors, the
financial market, and mining.
109. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
TO ARREST ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
DEVELOPMENTS. The private sector, including I F C clients, has been negatively affected by the

economic slowdown that the country has been experiencing during the past few years and the
uncertainties associated with political developments. In light o f these events, the domestic
banking sector has been experiencing an increase in non-performing loans. That has not been the
case for I F C portfolio where N o n Performing Loans (NpLs) remained under 0.5 percent (as endOctober 2003). However, remaining uncertainties in the country could have additional impacts
on the performance o f IFC’s clients. IFC’s activity w i l l emphasize prudent portfolio
management to arrest, to the extent possible, adverse effects of economic and political
developments that could impact i t s clients.
IFC w i l l help strengthen S M E s and
110. STRENGTHENING SMEs AND MICROENTERPRISES.
microenterprises in Bolivia through the newly established L A C S M E Facility, approved by the
Board in June 2003 (See B o x 1). Through the Facility, IFC together with donors w i l l provide
technical assistance for S M E s and microenterprises; advise the government jointly with the Bank
on ways o f reducing red tape and creating business incentives for SMEs; and facilitate S M E linkage programs related to I F C investments. In particular, the successful initiatives o f natural
resources management b y S M E s (such as ones framed within the forest certification programs
and other agriculture related operations) w i l l continue to be promoted.
Box 1. LAC SME Facility in Bolivia

With the Board approval in June 2003, the World Bank-IFC SME Department has launched the LAC S M E Facility,
a multi-donor technical assistance and capacity building program to promote private sector development through
support to SMEs. Initially i t covers Bolivia, Peru, Honduras and Nicaragua. In Bolivia, the Program was initiated
upon a request o f the government in November 2002.
Currently over 90 percent o f the workforce in Bolivia i s employed in the MSME sector, generating only 35
percent o f the GDP. A large level o f economic activity remains in the informal sector (in the manufacturing sector
nearly 100,000 establishments). One factor for the high level o f informality i s the high cost o f doing business in
Bolivia. Studies consistently rank Bolivia as one o f the most bureaucratic countries in the world.
Working with organizations and institutions that support SMEs, such as business associations and
registries, financial institutions, governments, N G O partners, universities, trainers, the Facility will focus i t s main
activity on: (i)
improving the capacity of financial institutions to better serve the S M E market by upgrading the

32

skills required to reach SMEs and analysis o f the instruments such as leasing; (ii)
improving the business enabling
environment by supporting selected government and World Bank initiatives (e.g. registration and licensing
simplification) particularly at the municipal level; (iii)
supporting the development of clusters in specific sectors in
Bolivia to expand high value added exports and create jobs and increase incomes particularly in sectors that have
high potential for poverty alleviation such as quinoa and wood; and (iv) depending on donor support, a number of
additional activities or “special programs” are envisaged, including: support to micro-finance institutions and SME
development programs to link rural producers into urban and export markets, and linkages programs in the o i l and
gas sectors.

111.

SELECTIVELY PARTICIPATING IN PROJECTS WHICH CAN DEMONSTRATE VIABLE INVESTMENT

OPPORTU
E
N
T
S
I.
IFC w i l l consider supporting viable, high impact transactions in such areas as
hydrocarbons, infrastructure including power, the social sector, the financial market, and mining
as opportunities arise and investment climate improves. While the relatively small size o f
Bolivia’s economy constrains the development o f larger industrial enterprises which could
benefit from direct IFC financing, IFC i s prepared to help finance investments given the
shortages o f sources o f long-term financing in Bolivia.

112.
HYDROCARBONS
SECTOR. Due to the importance o f the natural gas sector to GDPgrowth and government tax revenues, IFC would consider participating in financing projects
related to transporting and value-added use o f the gas and i t s associated crude, such as domestic
and export gas pipelines, gas to liquid (GTL) plants, improvements in existing refineries,
fertilizer plants. The degree o f IFC’s participation would, however, depend on the laws and
regulations related to the industry-in particular, the revised hydrocarbon law; potential impact
on the public referendum; the progress o f the implementation by the government o f the
government’s six priority political and economic objectives; and the level o f political stability in
Bolivia. In the case o f investing in these projects, IFC would also provide the projects with
international, social and environmental best practices to ensure long-term sustainability and
commitment from different stakeholders. In a larger project, IFC would explore revenue sharing
models in which revenue distribution i s clearly defined between the government, shareholders,
employees, local communities; and other interested parties. In addition, the financing may entail
an Sh4E-linkage component to strengthen their services to larger enterprises.
113.
INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING
POWER. Even though Bolivia’s infrastructure sector has
incorporated substantial private participation, Bolivia s t i l l needs substantial investment in this
sector. While IFC’s participation in the sector during the CAS period would depend largely on
the overall political and economic environment, and a stable regulatory framework, IFC would
selectively consider providing support for a private sector project in key areas such as power, as
well as telecommunications, transport, and water and sanitation. In a larger project, IFC may
consider a public-private sector partnership model to improve cost recovery for private sector
participants and reduce costs for consumers.
114. SOCIAL SECTOR AND FINANCIAL MARKET. IFc would also consider selectively investing
in the social sector, particularly in education. In the financial market, IFC may complement the
Bank efforts in improving regulatory and supervisory requirements with technical assistance on
governance and housing finance. IFC support w i l l especially be aimed at strengthening the risk
assessmenumanagement capabilities o f selected institutions and reinforcing corporate
governance in the banking sector.

33

F. MIGA Activities
115. MIGA currently has one US$15 million guarantee in Bolivia. MIGA remains ready to
provide political risk guarantees for foreign investors investing in suitable projects in Bolivia,
however, the current low level o f investor interest suggests that additional guarantees operations
in this upcoming CAS period may be unlikely.
G. WBI Activities
116. In the next CAS program, there w i l l be a concerted effort to increase the focus o f World
Bank Institute (WBI) programs compared to how the program was managed in the past. I t i s
expected that 80 percent o f the WBI program would be focused on the following four priority
areas, tailored to Bolivia’s needs. The remaining 20 percent o f the WBI program would cover a
variety o f ongoing regional programs.

117.

IMPROVING GOVERNANCE, WITH A FOCUS ON ANTICORRUPTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. Previous attempts at institutional reform were blocked by less

progressive members o f the traditional parties who did not want to see their party interests
affected. Because the current cabinet consists o f independents with no party affiliation, the
chances o f pushing through real institutional reform are higher today than they have been in the
past. This i s an area where President Mesa has expressed a strong desire to move ahead, and an
area where public demand for increased governance i s extremely high. The WBI Program would
bring worldwide experience and best practices to Bolivia and would draw upon the findings o f
the World Bank’s Institutional and Governance Review for Bolivia and the implementation
experience with the Institutional Reform Program. There would be close collaboration between
WBI staff and sector specialists.
118. IMPROVING VOICE, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND INCLUSION. The existing civil society program
has promoted participation but has not made any effort to strengthen institutions o f
representative democracy. Greater participation without universal confidence in the role o f
Congress to resolve conflicts has meant that the conflicts have been left to be decided in the
streets. The World Bank would l i k e to put more balance into i t s support for representative
democracy by instituting a program o f supporting the Parliament’s role in the PRSP process and
in instituting a program o f dissemination o f results o f the PER and C F A A to Parliament.
Continuing the efforts to strengthen the oversight capacity o f civil society would complement
this work.
119. PRO-POORGROWTH. The idea would be to bring worldwide experience to the Bolivians
to help them think through how best to structure public policy in this area. This module would
be linked to the governance and voice/accountability issues, since there i s some evidence that
deficiencies in these areas have contributed to the unsatisfactory progress in poverty reduction.
This work would also be related to the pro-poor growth component of the Poverty Assessment
and to the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis.
120. ACHIEVING MDGs. Again, the idea would be to bring worldwide experience on what
works and what does not to help both the central government and the municipalities formulate
policies and assign investments. Work related to the Shanghai Conference on scaling up
interventions could be useful.

H. Other Donor Assistance
121. In the immediate short term, other donors are also helping the government respond to the
crises of February and October 2003, through fast-disbursing budgetary support. Since the
October crisis, the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) has come forward with US$55
million; the Interamerican Development Bank i s providing US$50 million for new projects and
i s reassigning US$26 million o f i t s existing portfolio; the Netherlands i s providing US$6 million
and Denmark US$3 million o f budgetary support; and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) i s advancing US$8 million from i t s 2004 allocation. These activities
complement the support provided by the World Bank o f (i)
the US$14 million Emergency
Economic Recovery Credit; (ii)
acceleration o f the US$10 million second tranche o f the existing
Social Safety Net SAC; (iii)restructuring o f US$17 million from the existing Institutional
Reform Project; and (iv) a redirecting o f US$5.7 million from existing projects to confront
problems in El Alto and L a Paz.
122. The government i s aware that i t w i l l not always be possible for the international donors to
respond to repeated emergencies. The government’s strategy (discussed previously) i s designed
to break the pattern of repeated emergencies. Given the current rigidities in the budget and the
potential difficulties in raising immediately domestic resources, the financing o f the plan i s
dependent upon external resources. Indeed, how the government manages the stocks and flows
of i t s entire external assistance i s critical to the task o f resolving the immediate fiscal deficit
problems and getting back on track to meet i t s medium-term objectives. While the World Bank
i s an important actor, in 2002 i t accounted for only 13.6 percent o f the total gross disbursements,
and a lower percentage in terms o f net disbursements.
123. Basic information about the nature of the entire portfolio o f the donor community was
collected as part o f the CAS preparation, through a joint effort o f the W o r l d Bank, the IDB, and
the government. This information i s based on an extensive canvassing o f the main agencies
working in Bolivia, taking into account their plans for 2003-06. The main findings o f that report
are:
0

External assistance i s o f critical importance to overall public finances. The external
assistance from all agencies reached roughly 10 percent o f GDP last year, and financed
roughly one-third o f the public budget (see Table E.1 in Annex E).
There are roughly US$1.6 billion in undisbursed resources in existing projects and
roughly US$SOO million a year projected in new flows (see Table E.2 in Annex E).
There i s substantial inertia in the assignment o f external resources. The planned
allocation o f resources for 2003-06 look very similar to the actual allocation o f resources
that were made between 1998 and 2001 (see Table E.3 in Annex E)
The assistance provided by the donor community i s scattered across too many projects.
Over 1998-2002 there were 633 agreements signed between the government and the
donor community that translated into over 1,700 development projects (see Table E.4 in
Annex E).

124. Over time, i t would be advisable for the country to significantly reduce i t s dependence on
the donor community. With such high levels o f external assistance, i t would appear that the level
o f government i s high relative to what can be supported by domestic resources. While there may

35

be several understandable explanations for how Bolivia came to this position, the medium-term
strategy should be to actively reduce less-essential expenditures and raise the proportion o f
domestic financing while decreasing the percentage o f the public budget covered b y external
assistance.
125. I t w i l l be important not to treat this adjustment as a simple mechanical exercise, because
there are some important political economy elements at play. For example, if Bolivia starts to
receive increased revenue from gas, the donor community may take this as a signal to reduce,
dollar for dollar, i t s assistance. I f this were to happen, the net fiscal situation would remain the
same after initiating the gas export project as before. Assuming that the Gas Referendum turns
out positively and that a viable market i s found for the natural gas project, there could, after all,
be a backlash from the general public who might feel that the gas export project has yielded no
benefits. I t would be helpful if the level o f external assistance could be brought down gradually,
so that the gas export project could yield net positive results.
126. I f over the medium term the task should be to gradually bring down the level o f external
assistance, the main task over the short term-that is, over the first phase-should be to change
the m i x of external assistance. Based on the background analysis carried out for the CAS, i t
appears that there w i l l be a substantial amount o f money available for Bolivia. The problem i s
that Bolivia has money to do what may no longer be a priority, and does not have money to
cover the costs that i t must meet now. In particular, many o f the new flows o f money are to
finance additional reforms and initiatives, when the past reforms have not had their costs fully
covered.
127. Business as usual i s not likely to help Bolivia out o f i t s current problems. The first step i s
for the donor community to recognize that the foundation on which they assumed they were
building i s not as solid as they thought. I t i s not as solid because the implementation o f the
reforms has been incomplete or poorly executed in a number o f cases, and the necessary
financing underestimated. This lies at the heart o f some o f the country’s current fiscal deficit
problems (together with the loss in income as a result o f external and domestic shocks).
128. The second step i s for the government to lay out a credible plan that not only addresses
the short-term problems, but also lays out the end game that suggests how the country w i l l be
getting back on track in the medium term. In the recent past, Bolivia has lurched from crisis to
crisis-each time triggering a rush to provide rapid disbursing money with very few conditions
because the government, in i t s weakened position, i s not in a position to deliver additional
reforms. This plan should propose a modification o f the use o f future flows o f external
assistance to: (i)
ensure past reforms are adequately financed; and (ii)
cover new high-priority
activities to reduce inequality and poverty through greater efforts to help the poor generate
income. The plan should specify what efforts the country w i l l be making to mobilize more
domestic resources and to reduce less-essential expenditures.
129. Despite the current uncertainty surrounding the medium term, providing such a plan i s
critical, because the international agencies need a framework around which they can organize
their much-needed assistance. Given the fluidity o f the situation and the unexpected manner in
which the current administration came to power, the donor community must anticipate having to
work with rolling plans. However, i t would be extremely useful for there to be a common view
at any given time of what i s the short-term and medium-term plan prevailing at that moment. I t
would also be useful to know when the next iteration i s likely to come, so that the donor

36

community can take the necessary steps to ensure that the right amount and right type o f
assistance comes at the right time.
130. The third step i s for this change in the future flows o f external assistance to take place.
This w i l l not be easy for donor agencies, and would require strong leadership b y the government
to revitalize donor coordination and strengthen the development effectiveness o f the external
assistance that Bolivia receives.
The approach to donor coordination o f the
COORDINATION.
131. REVITALIZING DONOR
BanzedQuiroga administration demonstrated both the potential and the difficulties associated
with implementing the CDF principles. Over the Sanchez de Lozada administration, some stress
has been placed on donor coordination efforts-partly
caused b y the particularly difficult
economic circumstances and the type o f rapid assistance requested by the government and partly
caused b y a lower level o f government emphasis on donor coordination. Given that the donor
community has a potentially important role to play in getting Bolivia back on track towards
meeting i t s medium-term development goals, taking decisive action to revitalize donor
coordination should be a priority for the government and the entire donor community, including
the World Bank.
132. In the first months o f 2004, the bilateral and multilateral donors w i l l propose to the
government different options for structuring donor assistance in a workable fashion. The
government would retain i t s essential leadership role by taking the final decision on the structure
that would best facilitate the coordination-choosing from the different options or proposing
their own. However, the donor community would pursue a more pro-active approach, rather
than waiting for the government to develop from scratch a new structure for coordination.
133. The World Bank w i l l participate actively with other donors in this effort to revitalize
donor coordination. The World Bank could also take an active role in trying to convince other
donors that corrective action i s needed to ensure the financial sustainability o f existing reforms.
This may take some analytical work to highlight what policy actions were taken and to
demonstrate that when summing up the costs o f all reforms, domestic resources were not
sufficient to cover the costs. The World Bank could also work with other donors to implement
recommendations o f the PER and C F A A that would support the proposed portfolio shifts. A
second immediate task for the government to tackle with the help o f all donors (including the
World Bank) i s to address some o f the key implementation problems. As many o f these
problems are common across different programs, they are best addressed through a joint effort o f
all donors.
134. Once the government clarifies i t s medium-term objectives through the revision o f the
PRSP, two further tasks for the government and the donor community will be (i)
to align the
portfolio o f the donor community to the revised PRSP, and (ii)
to consolidate over 1,700 projects
into a more manageable number o f programs. There i s considerable interest in harmonization,
and some bilateral agencies are taking a leading role. Other key tasks relate to the overall
harmonization agenda coming out o f the High Level Forum in Rome. These additional activities
might include:
OF PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES AROUND NATIONAL NORMS.
The
135. HARMONIZATION
objective w i l l be for all agencies to use Bolivia norms in place o f their own for contracting,
independently o f whether the activity i s financed b y external or domestic resources. The
government has recently made improvements to the Bolivian norms, bringing them closer to

37

international standards. They ‘ w i l l be working closely with all agencies to identify and resolve
remaining objections to the use o f national norms. For some agencies, i t may prove impossible
to totally accept the Bolivian norms, but there w i l l be an attempt to keep differences to a
minimum.
COLLABORATION TO REDUCE TRANSACTIONS COSTS OF RECEIVING ASSISTANCE.
136. GREATER
There are a variety o f actions, ranging from common financing o f information systems that serve
the interests of all to joint supervision to more effective transmission o f knowledge from
headquarters to the country where the government (and many o f the donors) feel that better
organization and realization o f economies o f scale would have high payoffs.

I. Beyond the current CAS period
137. As the period covered by this CAS i s relatively short, i t may be useful to provide some
indication of the type o f projects that might be supported in the next CAS period. As mentioned
previously, there are two possible scenarios for Bolivia following the Constitutional Assemblyan optimistic scenario (with a successful outcome o f the Gas Referendum and Constitutional
Assembly, a revised PRSP in place, some fiscal adjustment done in an economically, politically
and socially viable way and social peace) and a pessimistic scenario (where Bolivia heads into a
vicious cycle in which poor economic decisions generate more social unrest that, in tum, reduces
the chances o f generating income for the poor).
138. Under the optimistic scenario, the World Bank would align i t s program closely with the
revised PRSP. As the revised PRSP w i l l undoubtedly have a strong focus on generating income
opportunities for the poor, i t is highly likely that the World Bank would develop projects to
support this objective. Particularly important would be the poor to benefit from trade. Given the
small size o f the domestic economy, the ability to generate labor intensive exports w i l l be crucial
for Bolivia’s development. The design o f these projects would build upon related ESW carried
out in FY04 and FY05, the World Bank’s Micro-economic Constraints to Growth study as well
as related follow-up work, the experience with I F C in the S M E Facility and other activities, the
results o f the pro-poor growth program of the WBI and the implementation experience with
related projects such as the Indigenous LE and the Spatial Rural Development Project. Table 8
presents the potential projects that might be presented, organized by the different categories in
the revised PRSP document presented at the October 2003 Consultative Group meeting. This i s
the latest available document that provides an indication o f how the PRSP might be revised.

139. Under the pessimistic scenario, i t may prove difficult for the W o r l d Bank to be effective.
Under this scenario, the World Bank might limit i t s projects to basic investments in
infrastructure and the social sectors.

J. CAS Consultations
140. As part o f the preparation o f the CAS, four consultations took place in different regions
of the country-in the highlands (Potosi), the lowlands (Santa Cruz), the valleys (Tarija) and the
Amazon (Riberalta). T w o consultations were carried out prior to the October 2003 social
conflict and two after. In total, during the four fora, around 256 representatives o f urban and
rural organizations, indigenous, ayllus, youth, women, NGOs, universities, “juntas vecinales,”
“comite‘s de vigilancia y control social,” small and medium entrepreneurs, unions, civic
committees, etc. participated. On average, 39 percent o f the participants were women and 6 1
percent men.

Main observations from the Santa Cruz and Tarija fora (before October social conflict):
High degree o f pessimism about the country’s current situation and i t s future;
Lack o f confidence in the government’s ability to administer international donor funds;
Strong criticism o f acts o f corruption at all three levels o f government-national,
departmental, and municipal;
Desire that there be more direct transfers o f resources to communities as a way to reach
the poor;
Considerable variation across organizations in the extent o f their knowledge and in their
opinions concerning the National Dialogue 2000, plans for the National Dialogue 2003,
the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the mechanisms o f social control;.
Widespread criticism of the “Comites de Vigilancia” (municipal-level citizen oversight
committees). Some participants felt that the oversight committees had been co-opted b y
local politicians;

39

Strong demand for increased decentralization;
Criticism of the government for not doing more to support the productive sector,
combined with requests that the World Bank do more in this area. Surprisingly, few
participants linked the expected revenues from gas to an ability to be able to provide
more assistance;
Participants tended to generalize. Although there were a wide group of organizations
represented in the fora, they appeared to have little in the way o f specific proposals about
what to do; and
NGOs tended to be more critical o f the World Bank and donor assistance, in general,
whereas campesino (peasant) organizations tended to take a more pragmatic position,
asking what more could be done to receive financial and technical assistance.
Main observations f r o m Riberalta and Potosi fora (after October social conflict):
0
The two regions had different perspectives about the country’s new situation. There was
considerably more optimism expressed in Riberalta (Amazonia) than Potosi (highlands).
Participants in Riberalta felt that with the changes o f October more spaces had been
opened for civil participation and that the new administration should be given time to
complete i t s agenda. Participants in Potosi felt that there had only been a change in the
administration, but that there had not been any major substantive change.
0
In both regions there was a strong demand for more information about the plans for the
Gas Referendum and the Constitutional Assembly;
0
In Potosi, the general view was that there was hardly any need for a Gas Referendum, as
in their mind the issues had been settled as an outcome o f the October conflict. They felt
that the use of gas should be guaranteed for all that it should be used first to help
industrialize the country and only after domestic uses had been exploited should i t be
exported. In Riberalta, the participants were in favor o f having a Gas Referendum as
they felt civil society should participate in the definition o f policy. Participants were
more supportive o f exporting gas, but mentioned that there should social control to ensure
that the gas benefits, in a equitable way, the development o f the productive sectors, health
and education;
0
In Potosi, participants felt that the Constitutional Assembly should involve a deep and
broad analysis o f the Constitution with the objective o f making significant changes. In
Riberalta, the participants felt that changes were needed to grant greater autonomy to
each region and to allow higher levels o f direct participation in decision-making
processes;
0
As in Santa Cruz and Tarija, there was a call for more direct transfer o f resources to
regions, communities and organizations as a way to achieve better results; and
Participants in both Riberalta and Potosi felt that there should be a more equitable
distribution o f resources, especially land.

141. In considering the implications o f these consultations for the preparation o f this CAS and,
especially, for the implementation of the CAS going forward, a number of points stand out.
First, there was universal recognition that Bolivia i s in a very difficult situation. There was also
more or less general agreement with the World Bank’s reading o f the situation (described in this
CAS and shared with participants at the fora). Second, there appear to be strong differences in

40

views held in the different regions, which may come to the forefront around discussions o f the
Constitutional Assembly. Third, there was a concern about corruption at all levels o f
government. Managing resources at the municipal level, closer to the citizens, was not seen as
being necessarily better in terms o f corruption-largely because the citizen oversight committees
were not seen as functioning well in practice. Making the mechanisms o f social control more
effective w i l l be an important challenge for the country in the coming years. Fourth, there was
strong interest in having more resources managed directly by the community. This w i l l be done
within the World Bank’s existing Participatory Rural Development Project and in the proposed
Spatial Rural DevelopmentICommunity-drivendevelopment project. Fifth, there was universal
demand for the government (and the donor community) to pay more attention to supporting the
productive sectors. This w i l l be done with the new program o f projects and ESW in this CAS,
with the expectation o f follow-up in the next CAS period. Finally, there was universal demand
for the World Bank and the government to demonstrate what results had been achieved with the
assistance and an almost palpable thirst for information, particularly among the youth
representatives at the fora . The World Bank Country Office has recently instituted a Public
Information Center (PIC) and has made information on i t s projects available in Spanish,
Quechua, Aymara and Guarani. Continued efforts on dissemination and on consultation are
needed.
K. Environmental Issues
142. The success in long-term sustainable development w i l l depend on the ability o f future
development policies and poverty reduction programs to fully integrate environmental issues and
to focus on the sustainable use o f natural resources.
143. Bolivia’s economy is, and w i l l remain in the near future, highly dependent on the
The
exploitation o f i t s natural resource base (see key environmental indicators in Annex I).
modalities o f use o f these resources, and the institutional and regulatory aspects associated with
these patterns o f use, determine opportunities to promote growth, but can also be responsible for
most of i t s limiting factors, because they can directly intensify the poverty levels o f the
population, if inappropriate. T w o important challenges in the development agenda o f the
upcoming decade are: (i)
the need to expand the potential o f the natural resource base to promote
growth, and (ii)
the need to avoid negative environmental impacts from productive activities,
which w i l l directly affect the livelihood o f the poor. Productive sectors like agriculture,
irrigation, energy, and forestry have s t i l l untapped potential to generate growth if the binding
factors limiting the sustainable use o f these resources are addressed (particularly in relation to the
limited access to productive, human, and financial assets, and to improved technologies and
infrastructure). A good example o f this available potential i s seen in the Bolivian forests and
their successful certification program, where today only 20 percent o f the total productive forests
are managed sustainably.
144. The up-front consideration o f environmental aspects in most sectoral activities i s also
essential to reduce poverty and enhance many o f the country’s human development indicators
and Millennium Development Goals. As such, infrastructure investments planned to enhance
hydrocarbon, industry, and agriculture activities need to be accompanied by honest
environmental assessments and early planning to control emissions and avoid potential conflicts
in land use. Environmental safeguards should be incorporated in health programs to minimize

41

the employment o f persistent organic pollutants and carcinogens in malaria-and
other
parasites-control plans, and in the monitoring of water systems feeding urban and rural areas, to
control impacts from mining activities on individual health and agriculture production.

145. Given that most o f the productive activities in the country (mining, agriculture, industry)
are highly water dependent, a third important challenge in the development agenda o f the
country refers to the use and management o f water resources. Issues requiring particular
attention relate to the enhancement o f water availability in the drought-prone areas of the center
and southeast, management o f the water cycle in the Amazonian valleys, regulations to address
conflicting uses and their cross impacts, and enforcement o f regulations to control pollution
effects. Sanitation i s also a major issue on the agenda, particularly in rural areas, where only 35
percent o f the households have access to potable water.
146. Future poverty reduction efforts should foster the environment-development integration
process, and make the environment, and the natural resource base, an engine to promote growth.
This can only be achieved by encouraging a culture that favors public-private partnerships and
dialogue, by identifying local solutions and providing responses to sustainable development
initiatives at the local level, by developing resource-based income streams for the poor, and by
adjusting the culture and the patterns o f development, production, and consumption, which w i l l
in turn require transformations in value systems, attitudes, and social behavior.
L. Gender Issues
147. Over the last decade, the government has placed greater emphasis on tracking indicators
related to gender, especially with regard to education, health, and the labor market.
148. In education, the gap between boys and girls has narrowed at the primary level, but
disparities remain at the secondary level. The ratio o f girls to boys in primary education hovered
around 100 percent, while the average years o f schooling stands at 8.44 for men and 6.81 for
women. Disparities also remain between urban and rural areas (see Table 9).

149. On the health front, the recently launched Seguro Universal Matemo Znfantil ( S U M I ) i s
tackling mother and child health care. There i s a long way to go in improving living standards,
especially for women living in rural areas. For instance, in the rural area more than 74 percent o f
newborns were attended by unslulled staff in 2001.

42

150. With regard to the productive sector, there i s a major bias against women regarding
entrance into the labor market. When turning 25, more than 90 percent o f men are part o f the
workforce, in contrast to 70 percent o f women. In addition, major differences in salaries remain
between women and men.
151. The government i s addressing gender disparities b y implementing a series o f policies that
recognizes the difference in responsibilities and roles that women and men face at the different
stages o f their lives. Public policies w i l l focus on rural areas, since disparities there are more
evident than in urban areas.
M. Procurement
152. Reforms of the public contracting system in Bolivia aim at strengthening the current legal
and institutional procurement framework in a manner consistent with international procurement
standards and practices in order to ensure increased conditions o f transparency, economy, and
efficiency in management o f public procurement, reducing levels o f corruption in the public
sector, and providing sustainability to implemented reforms.
153. Harmonization o f policies and procedures i s a key objective o f procurement reforms in
Bolivia. The Government o f Bolivia and the Bank have discussed this issue along with the
implementation o f the agreed Action Plan of the Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) with a view to achieving such objective through: (i)
preparation o f modem procurement
legislation compatible with international standards and practices, including the implementation
o f a national regulatory agency and a Code o f Ethics for public procurement staff; (ii)
gradual
implementation o f an e-government procurement system; and (iii)
issuing o f adequate local
standards procedures and adoption o f standardized local bidding documents at all levels o f
government.
154. Overall procurement risk assessment o f Bolivia i s rated as high, although significant
improvement has been achieved in the C D F context by a majority o f project-implementing
agencies. Assigned risk assessment level i s due mainly to a limited institutional capacity for
implementing projects at all levels, particularly at the local government level; lack o f qualified
procurement staff in a number o f agencies to carry out procurement functions and tasks in an
efficient manner; and the need to introduce modem and streamlined country procurement
policies and procedures.

N. Financial Management
155. An assessment o f the financial accountability arrangements o f the Bolivia public sector
was conducted b y the Bank in 1999. The report concluded that (i)
the government systems did
not provide reliable information sufficient to permit an evaluation o f the government’s
performance; (ii)
the Supreme Audit Institution (CGR) did not report on the government’s
annual financial statements; and (iii)there was a lack o f control of government-owned fixed
assets.
156. On the basis o f the 1999 CFAA, the government and the Bank agreed to a financial
improvement action plan, the major items o f which were included among the benchmarks o f the
First Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC-I), and included (i)
the unambiguous
application of the Supreme Decree that related to the Integrated Financial Management Systems

43

(SIGMA), and (ii)a commitment to achieve agreed minimum benchmarks in financial
management in all central government ministries through the implementation o f SIGMA.
157. A review o f the advances against benchmarks set in the PSAC-I, conducted in December
2001, indicated that S I G M A became operational in all central government ministries. This
implementation now facilitates reliable reporting o f budget execution. In addition, data on
government expenditure has been made available to the public, through the Internet. During
2002, SIGMA also began operating in some decentralized entities, including FPS and the
National Customs Service. However, the scope and operations o f SIGMA need to be expanded
to the rest o f the decentralized entities and regional (prefectures) and municipal levels in order to
contribute to the completion o f one o f the major recommendations o f the CFAA.

158. The Government o f Bolivia has demonstrated i t s commitment to decentralization and
popular participation in local governance, as guiding principles for the reform o f the country’s
public administration. An anticonuption strategy and institutional reform (fundamentally linked
to the anticonuption battle) are high on the government’s agenda. Efforts are being made to
clarify roles, responsibilities, and fiscal and financial relations among different levels o f public
administration (national, prefectural, and municipal).

159. From the Donor perspective, the World Bank and other financing agencies have seen
their business change considerably in recent years. The relative increase in adjustment lending,
debt relief and sector programs, in place o f traditional investment projects has reduced the
relative importance o f traclung individual borrower transactions as a source o f fiduciary
assurance and highlighted the importance o f assessing the country’s own Public Financial
Management (PFM) system. Meanwhile, the increasing emphasis by donors on worlung with,
and improving, government institutions and systems, has indicated a need to better understand
opportunities for enhancing public sector performance, and thus reducing fiduciary risk.
160. There i s additionally a demand from the public for increased government transparency
and accountability. This i s expressed through citizen and political groups, which have gained
significant strength in Bolivia over the past several years.
161. Bolivia has been identified as one of the Pilots for Harmonization. Therefore, during the
CAS period, efforts w i l l be intensified to harmonize operational policies at the institutional and
country level in order to enhance effectiveness and efficiency and promote greater country
ownership. These efforts w i l l be guided by directives laid down by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC)
Task Force on donor practices. Critical to the success o f this initiative would be the
government’s commitment to lead the agenda and the engagement o f a critical mass o f countrybased donors.
162. Further coordination i s proposed through a joint diagnostic review o f private sector
accounting practices, leading to identification o f opportunities for capacity building in the
accounting profession. In addition, in response to institutional weaknesses observed in some
implementing agencies, institutional development grants w i l l be a key instrument in capacity
building.
163. In view o f a possible increase in noninvestment lending in the portfolio b y the Bank and
other donors, i t i s recommended that testing be conducted in order to evaluate the fiduciary

reference and quality assurance w o u l d be provided by the donor community.

165. At this point, the revised PRSP presented at the October 2003 Consultative Group
meetings provides the best indication of how the government would work to meet i t s mediumterm objectives. In i t s revised PRSP, the government has placed considerable emphasis on
achieving the MDGs and has presented explicit targets for the social and productive sectors,
which are set out in Table 11.

166. The government has made an initial attempt to estimate the costs o f reaching the targets,
and presents two sets o f estimates. One assumes that 60 percent o f the target w i l l be reached,
and the other that 100 percent o f the target w i l l be reached, b y 2015. The methodology and
assumptions used for the estimates are described in the government document. The state o f the
art in estimating financing requirements for meeting MDGs does not allow for a great deal o f
precision-in either Bolivia or in other countries. Thus, the estimates should be taken as
ballpark figures, subject to later revision.
167. Notwithstanding these caveats, the best estimates that the government has at this time
suggest that the costs o f achieving 100 percent o f the social goals would run around US$1.4
billion a year, and the costs o f reaching 100 percent o f the productive sector goals would run
around US$1.1 billion a year. The total o f US$2.5 billion a year i s over four times the average
amount o f external resources received by Bolivia during 1998-2001, and around three times that
received in 2002, which was a record year. Clearly, the financing gap dwarfs the amount o f
external resources likely to be available. The government would be able to advance aggressively
toward their MDG targets only if considerably higher levels o f concessional financing were
available in the future than has been made available in the past.

46

168. The revised PRSP carries out a second exercise that identifies the desired relative
allocation across productive investments (roughly 59 percent o f total investment), production
chains and local economic development (13 percent), and social sector investments (28 percent).
In making this relative allocation, the government estimates per capita expenditures to increase
progressively from US$607 million in 2003 to US$713 million in 2007.
169. The government recognizes that in order to achieve national targets, it w i l l be necessary
to set municipal targets, since implementation o f policies i s carried out in a considerably
decentralized setting. The government has proposed to condition part o f the intergovernmental
transfers from the central level to municipalities on efforts made by the municipalities to achieve
national goals. If a municipality has poor indicators in, say infant mortality, and i s not taking
steps to address the problem, they would find themselves with less resources. This conditioning
should also have the effect o f improving the results orientation and generating faster
achievement o f the targets. I t i s not clear whether this approach w i l l s t i l l be pursued after the
change in administration.
170. T w o other important steps that the government proposes to take over the upcoming CAS
period are: (i)
consolidating the over 1,700 development projects into a reduced number o f
approximately 100 projects (this should make i t easier to set a manageable number o f targets);
and (ii)
the carrying out o f a pilot test o f a municipal level information system (with the support
o f the World Bank), with the expectation that this would soon be rolled out in all municipalities
in the country.
171. Finally, i t i s realistic to acknowledge that i t w i l l be a number o f years before a resultsbased management approach w i l l take hold in Bolivia. Some other key elements that are needed
(and that are not yet in place) include:
Improved data and information systems-particularly at the municipal level.
Development o f systematic approaches to link policy actions to results12.
Formulation o f adequate intermediate targets to orient decisions in the productive sector
(this lags behind advances in the social sectors).
Workable approaches to attributing the contribution o f the actions o f a particular agency
to a particular result.
Reorientation o f the budgetary allocation system to ensure that financial resources flow to
key bottlenecks that stand in the way of achieving results.
Improved donor coordination and greater harmonization o f procedures in order to provide
more flexibility in the allocation o f resources but with enhanced accountability for
results.
Public sector reform that would ensure that government positions and political rewards
follow from delivering results-rather than from political patronage.
Much greater transparency o f government programs, and transparency o f expenditures
and outcomes.
A champion within government to promote a results-based management approach.
Greater familiarity o f and s k i l l with evidence-based advocacy on the part o f the public.
12. The World Bank i s helping the government develop explicit quantitative models using tools from system
dynamics theory to make explicit the link between policy actions and results. Progress has been made with
such models in the areas o f malaria, TB, Chagas, and education, and w i l l be gradually extended to other areas.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
173. This CAS i s being prepared during a period o f considerable difficulties and uncertainty in
Bolivia. Bank management believes that the role of the World Bank in helping the country
through this difficult time i s important and this i s no time to disengage. Bank management
proposes a strong package of financial assistance and rapidly delivered technical assistance to be
delivered under a CAS that would cover two years, FY04 and FY05. This support would be
aligned closely with the government’s program and, together with the continued implementation
o f the existing portfolio, the new programs would help the country address problems o f
exclusion, inequality, poverty and fiscal imbalance.

Sustainability Analysis

A. The Baseline Scenario
1.
The baseline scenario assumes a conservative macro framework. Rates o f output growth
are lower than those employed in the scenario the Government and the IMF have agreed upon
under the current I M F ’ s Standby Agreement. In particular, i t i s assumed that without a gas
export project, the real GDP growth converges to 3.6 percent (this figure being the average
growth rate for 1990-2002, this period includes economic boom o f mid 1990’s and the ongoing
economic crisis that started in 1999).’ This scenario takes into account the programmed World
Bank support to Bolivia presented in this document. I t i s assumed that both the World Bank’s
and the other creditors’ graduation o f concessional credits starts progressively in 2004. Exports
and FDI inflows should be less buoyant that in previous scenarios, i t i s assumed that a gas export
project would start in 2008. External capital flows are assumed to decrease in 2003 and 2004
recovering modestly afterwards; FDI increases from 2008 due to the gas export project. On the
fiscal front, a progressive fiscal adjustment i s assumed to take place over the 2004-08 period.
The baseline scenario rules out the possibility o f a financial crisis or generalized social conflicts.
Table C2.1 summarizes the assumptions in the macroeconomic framework.

2.
In the baseline scenario total debt stock indicators do not show an explosive pattern (see
Figure C2.1). The stock of debt to GDP deteriorates until 2005, reaching a level o f 80.6 percent,
1. In the very short run, despite the decline in domestic demand (mainly due to the difficult social and political
situation), exports are leading economic growth: the hydrocarbon sector sustained i t s performance, agriculture
production (mainly due to soybeans) increased and textiles production recovered. In the medium-term, real
output will be positively affected by the recovery o f Brazil’s gas demand (as currently projected). This would
increase prospects for increasing gas exports to Brazil. Currently, gas exports stand at only about 13.5 M M m 3
per day, while the take or pay clause o f the Gas Supply Agreement has already reached 18 M M m 3 per day.

77

then recovers and reaches 65.8 percent by 2015. The net present value (NPV) o f debt to GDP
deteriorates until 2005, reaching a level o f 62 percent and remains constant until 2015.
Convergence between the NPV debt and the nominal terms debt curves reveal the impact o f the
graduation and the increase in domestic debt. External debt f l o w indicators do not show an
explosive pattern, either.
Domestic debt f l o w indicators suggest there w i l l be liquidity problems in the medium3.
term related to servicing domestic debt. Despite the primary balance adjustment, the shock debt
indicators deteriorate dramatically f r o m 2009 due t o the increase o f domestic debt service. This
behavior reflects the recent increases in domestic debt, the shortage o f external financing and the
uneven composition o f the domestic debt (concentrated in very short term and long term
instruments)-a significant amount o f domestic have to be amortized in the very short term; by
2009 l o n g term debt instruments (AFP bonds) start to be amortized, thus increasing debt service
payments between 2009 t o 2015. The pattern o f domestic debt indicates that t o achieve domestic
debt sustainability the Government needs to find additional grants and concessional credits to
substitute domestic financing (Scenario 5). T o reduce domestic debt service payments in 200915, the Government should find altemative sources for financing the cost o f the pension reform
and find ways t o diversify i t s total public debt.

B. Altemative Economic Peij6ormance and Fiscal Adjustment (Scenarios 2, 3 and 4)

4.
Scenario 2 differs f r o m the baseline only in the better fiscal adjustment o f the
Government, which aggressively reacts to lower economic performance by reducing i t s

78

expenditures and by increasing tax revenues2. Given the current social and political situation, the
fiscal adjustment assumed by this alternative scenario might be very difficult to implement. To
assess how fiscal sustainability i s affected by lower economic growth rates and less optimistic
export prospects, Scenario 3 assumes more pessimistic GDP growth since there i s no
implementation of any project similar to the liquid natural gas (LNG) project. The FDI prospects
are lower, export growth i s significantly reduced. Other external financing assumptions are the
baseline's. Fiscal adjustment assumptions for Scenario 3 are those from the baseline. Scenario 4
differs from the Scenario 3 in the better fiscal adjustment o f the Government, which aggressively
reacts to lower economic performance.

5.
The outcome o f alternative scenarios i s presented in Figure C2.2 and Tables C2.2 to
C2.5. Results from Scenario 2 show that if an aggressive fiscal adjustment takes place, debt
sustainability i s achieved; given the current social and political situation this fiscal adjustment
might be difficult to implement. As compared to the baseline, Scenario 3 shows that all debt
indicators deteriorate, attesting that if low economic performance i s assumed, debt sustainability
i s significantly affected. However, fiscal sustainability in the l o w economic performance
scenario can improve significantly if the Government reacts to lower growth rates by reducing
current expenditures and/or increasing fiscal revenues (Scenario 4).

C. Scenario with No Domestic Financing and only Extemal Financing (Scenario 5 )

6.
An alternative scenario, based on the base case, i s considered to illustrate the relative
contribution o f the build-up o f internal debt to Bolivia's debt problem. T o do so, the base case i s
2.

Starting from the baseline fiscal adjustment assumption, Scenario 2 assumes that current expenditures are
reduced by 0.25 percent o f GDP per year from 2004 to 2015 and that tax revenues increase by 0.25 percent o f
GDP per year from 2005 to 2015.

79

compared with a hypothetical case which includes n o internal financing with the entire debt
financed by an unidentified external creditor under conditions that would prevail under a blend
o f concessionary and nonconcessionary f i n a n ~ i n g . ~Figure C2.3 compares the results o f this
scenario with those o f the baseline. In this scenario, stock and f l o w indicators are better than in
the base case and the nominal value and NPV o f debt to GDP are reduced significantly in the
medium term. The debt service to public revenues also decreases. This reflects the impact o f
more expensive domestic debt and highlights the danger o f the government turning to more
accessible but more expensive domestic debt to finance the fiscal deficit.

D. Scenarios of Financial Crisis and Insuficient Fiscal Adjustment (Scenarios 6 and 7)

7.
T w o critical scenarios were simulated t o evaluate the effects o f t w o risks in the Bolivian
economy: (i)the possible inability to attain a progressive fiscal adjustment (Scenario 6); and (ii)
the effects o f a financial crisis triggered say by further political instability a n d o r increased social
unrest (Scenario 7).4 Figure C2.4 compares the results o f these t w o scenarios with those o f the
baseline. Results o f Scenario 6 do not show fiscal sustainability: the domestic debt service
becomes such a heavy burden for fiscal accounts that by 2008 the ratio o f nominal stock o f debt
3. The assumed conditions in scenario 5 are: 10 years o f maturity, 2 years o f grace and an interest rate o f 4 percent.
4. Starting from the assumptions o f Scenario 3 (without gas), Scenario 6 assumes a permanent increase in current
expenditures o f 1 percent GDP from 2004 onwards; the long term growth rate o f real output i s reduced by 0.5
percentage points. External capital flows, especially o f FDI and export performance are reduced as well. The
baseline-scenario-levels of external financing are maintained, this implies that public debt growth i s explained
essentially by an increase in domestic debt. Scenario 7 starts from the assumptions o f Scenario 3 as well and
assumes that a financial crisis takes place during 2004. The total fiscal cost o f the financial crisis i s assumed to
amount 5 percent o f GDP and i s fully supported by the Government o f Bolivia (GOB) during 2004 and i s
financed by domestic debt.
80

to GDP enters in an unstable exploding path. D u e to liquidity and solvency difficulties in the
medium-term, this scenario i s clearly fiscal unsustainable. Results of Scenario 7 l i e between the

results of Scenarios 6 and 3; they do not show fiscal sustainability either. Similarly, debt service
starts to increase rapidly f r o m 2009 onwards. As a result, the ratio of the stock debt t o GDP
remains constant at about 70 percent of GDP (reflecting the relative increase of debt in
commercial terms-domestic debt, relative to debt on concessional terms).

ANNEXE: BOLIVIA CAS

- INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION
ASSISTANCE

1.
Basic information about the nature o f the entire portfolio of the International
Cooperation was collected as part o f the CAS preparation, through a joint effort o f the World
Bank, IDB and the Government. This information i s based on an extensive canvassing o f the
main agencies working in Bolivia, taking into account their plans for the period 2003-2006.
Some o f the important findings from that study are as follows:
External assistance is of critical importance to overall public finances.

2.
External assistance reached roughly 10 percent o f GDP last year and financed roughly
one third o f the public budget. The total i s more that all public investment. The Government
resorted to increased financing from C A F in 2002 to finance part o f the fiscal deficit.
Disbursements from all sources in 2002 reached US$784 million compared to an average o f
US$572 million in the previous years. C A F disbursements in 2002 were US$278 million,
roughly US$200 million more than their average o f the previous three years. The levels o f
assistance provided b y different agencies are presented below in Table E.1. There are roughly
US$1.6 billion in undisbursed resources in existing projects and roughly US$SOO million a year
projected in new flows.

The projected new flows represent a significant increase over what Bolivia received over
the 1998-2001, which was around US$572 million. This increase i s largely due to increases of
the multilaterals, rather than the bilaterals. Table E.2 shows how the current stock o f projects are
distributed and where new resources are expected to be allocated. There i s considerable inertia
in the system. The planned allocation o f resources for the period 2003-06 looks very similar to
the actual allocation o f resources that were made between 1998 and 2001

Table E.3 contrasts planned expenditures over the period 2003-06 with actual
disbursements over the 1998-01 period.

5.
The planned allocations represent the aggregation o f decisions taken independently by
the different agencies. Because the original PRSP did not specify detailed priorities, virtually all
donor activities were considered to be consistent with the strategy. Thus, no reorientation of the
portfolio to the PRSP took place between 2001 and 2003.
Some initial observations on planned expenditures over the 2003-06 period that are
6.
worth noting include the following. The amount projected to be spent in education in the future
(2003-06) i s less than in the past and i s lower (at 6 percent o f total external resources) than one
might expect given i t s importance. A high percentage o f past and future external resources are
spent on institutional strengthening (roughly 17 percent or projected for 2003-06, some US$500
million). One could certainly question whether there has been sufficient progress to show for the
amount spent (largely in paying salaries). Relatively small amounts are projected for

92

productivity and competitiveness (3.2 percent o f total assistance), despite the emphasis on this
topic in the government's revised PRSP.

Assistance provided by the International Cooperation is scattered across too many projects.

7.
The detailed analysis o f external assistance revealed excessive dispersion o f effort. Over
1998-2002 there were 633 agreements signed between the Government and the International
Cooperation that translated into over 1700 development projects. The distribution o f agreements

The sheer numbers of projects complicates greatly the task o f generating a results
orientation. Even if one were to assume that each project has only one objective (which typically
i s not the case), this would imply that the Government i s trying to achieve at least 1,700
objectives. Obviously, this i s infeasible.

Annex G. Experience over the last CAS period

Annex G

Country: Bolivia
Date of CAS: M a y 1998
Date of Progress Report(s): M a y 2001

Introduction
The last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Bolivia was designed to cover five years
(FY98-FY02) so as to coincide with the term o f the then-newly-elected Government o f Hugo
Banzer. I t was entirely aligned with the government’s development plan except for the
component relating to coca eradication policy where the Bank decided to not be active because i t
does not have a comparative advantage in the area. In M a y 2001, in light o f two important
developments that would have an impact on the Bank’s assistance-the introduction o f the
Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) and the preparation o f Bolivia’s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)-a CAS Progress Report was presented to the Board. The
CAS Progress Report presented a planned lending program for FY03 that included new actions
to make the Bank’s program consistent with the PRSP.

This annex looks back at the country planning process and the achievement o f country results
and CAS outcomes over the last CAS period (1998-2002). I t also assesses the performance o f
the Bank during the previous CAS period in terms o f the quality o f i t s products and services, the
delivery o f i t s lending and technical assistance program and the status o f the portfolio. Over the
last years, the Bank has worked closely with other donors to support the government’s program.
Thus, this report presents some of the important findings from an Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) assessment o f the implementation o f the C D F in Bolivia, which allowed the
Bank to play an important role in the donor coordination effort. I t also reports on the extensive
consultation process that culminated in the preparation o f the country’s PRSP, which was fully
supported by the Bank. This report concludes by presenting a brief assessment o f the
performance o f the CAS.

A.

Country Planning Process

Following a nation-wide participatory process that brought together government and civil society
representatives in 1997 (known as the First National Dialogue), the Banzer Administration
developed a National Action Plan for the 1997-2002 period. The plan was a comprehensive
strategy structured around four pillars-dignity,
equity, institutionality and opportunitydesigned to deal with coca eradication, improve social indicators and reduce inequality, promote
institutional reform and foster economic growth and reduce poverty. I t identified the most
important development challenges and possible actions to address them.
In 1997, the incoming Banzer Administration also launched an external aid framework called the

Nuevo Marc0 de Relacionamiento entre el Gobiemo y la Cooperacidn Intemacional, a proposal

aimed at increasing the effectiveness of development aid and aligning external assistance with
political vision. In M a y 1999 the Government and the Bank officially launched the CDF, but the
implementation of i t s principles-long-term
holistic vision, country ownership, country-led
115

partnership and results orientation-took place in the middle of a complex situation: at the same
time that recognized economic, social and institutional advances were taking place, social
tensions were becoming even more evident.

By 2000 Bolivia was eligible for a debt reduction package under the enhanced m g h l y Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC 11) initiative. Bolivia qualified to begin receiving assistance under HIPC I1
when the Boards o f the Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) endorsed the country’s
PRSP in early 2001. One o f the noteworthy features o f Bolivia’s PRSP i s that i t was developed
following an extensive bottom-up consultation process. In 2000, the government undertook a
broad consultation process with civil society and with representatives o f municipal governments
known as the Second National Dialogue. The PRSP considerably redefined the nature o f the
government’s interventions b y recognizing the important role municipalities should play in
reducing poverty. With the HIPC I1 debt relief, for the first time resources were going to be
distributed to municipalities in accordance with poverty criteria.
The PRSP was a
comprehensive strategy organized around the following four strategic components: (i)
expanding
employment and income opportunities by supporting and promoting productive capabilities, (ii)
building capabilities by guaranteeing improvements in the delivery o f social services, (iii)
increasing security and protection for the poor and the most vulnerable segments o f the
population, and (iv) promoting integration and social participation.
Tracking Results
There have been several efforts to set and track targets related to development outcomes in
Bolivia. The country’s initial efforts at identifying results and establishing performance targets
began with the HIPC Iinitiative in 1998 and were taken up again as a central part o f the progress
review conducted during the Consultative Group (CG) meetings later that year. This set o f
indicators and target goals replaced those indicators established under the National Action Plan.
In August o f 2000, the Government noted that 16 out o f the 17 core targets were met. In
particular, significant advances were made in increasing the productivity of labour in the nontraditional agricultural sector, providing piped water, modernizing public administration, and
eradicating coca.
Bolivia’s PRSP established the overarching goal o f reducing poverty levels from 63 percent in
2000 to 41 percent by 2015. I t i s difficult at this early stage to report on progress in this longterm goal, but the PRSP also established another set o f impact, intermediate and results
indicators that are being closely monitored b y the Government. Since the PRSP was endorsed in
early 2001, the Government’s Economic and Social Policy Analysis Unit (UDAPE) prepared a
series o f progress reports. In qualitative terms, these reports identify the main recognized
achievements o f the PRSP to be: (i)
a better targeting o f resources at poverty reduction; (ii)
the
progressive distribution o f resources so as to benefit the poorest population and the creation o f
the Fondo Solidario Municipal to reduce the historical shortage in the availability o f teachers and
health staff, primarily in poor rural municipalities; (iii)the development o f participatory
mechanisms at the municipal level to improve decision-making in resource allocation; (iv) the
implementation o f the Mechanism o f Social Control (MCS), which includes civil society
institutions and an inter-institutional government committee, designed to improve participatory
evaluation mechanisms to follow-up on the PRSP; and (v) substantial progress regarding the
PRSP implementation plan.
116

The implementation o f the C D F in Bolivia strengthened the focus on results in the public sector
and the donor community. By 2000, Bolivia was already known as one o f the two countries that
had made the most overall progress among all C D F countries. The O E D carried out a multipartner evaluation of Bolivia’s progress in all four principles o f the CDF: a long-term, holistic
framework; results orientation; country ownership; and country-led partnership. According to
the OED evaluation, there have been important achievements under the CDF, Bolivia’s PRSP
has succeeded in articulating a long-term vision focused on poverty alleviation, and other wideranging reforms have taken place. Government ownership o f the C D F was strong and the
process o f developing the PRSP was a step forward in extending i t s principles beyond the public
sector. The development o f the PRSP benefited from strong participation from various segments
o f civil society, and i t emerged as a bottom-up process. The continuation o f the process has
being guaranteed b y the passage o f the Dialogue Law. Progress has also been made in the
government taking ownership o f the donors’ long desired goal o f improving the c i v i l service
system. In terms o f partnership, an effective in-country forum for partner coordination was
temporarily in place, and donor assistance programs were aligned with the country National
Action Plan and then with Bolivia’s PRSP. The increased government participation in donorgovernment C G meetings i s a major advance, while steps have been taken in moving away from
traditional donor-driven and freestanding projects toward broader sector-wide approaches that
support national goals. With regard to a focus on results, the development o f information
systems has been impressive in the last few years (a summary o f the production o f statistical
information i s provided in Box. 1) and there has been some progress in elaborating mechanisms
to track development results.
Box 1. Information systems

In general, the production o f statistical information i s carried out in conjunction with the organizations that
make up the National System o f Statistical Information. The actual production o f basic statistical information
in Bolivia i s realized principally by the National Institute o f Statistics (Znstituto Nacional de Estadistica, INE),
the Economic Analysis Policy Unit (Unidad de Andlisis de Politicas Econdmicas y Sociales, UDAPE), and the
sectoral ministries. Raw data i s obtained through the national censuses, surveys, and administrative registers
which, in turn, are compiled from health centers, educational units, ministries, municipal offices, and some
public companies.
The Znstituto Nacional de Estadistica (INE) collects and maintains all data sources for poverty reduction
efforts. There are two principal data sources used for measuring and monitoring poverty in Bolivia: a national
census (of which the last installment was in 2001) and various household surveys. The national census (Censo
Nacional de Poblacion y Vivienda), carried out approximately every ten years, provides data on non-monetary
indicators o f well-being which i s then used for building poverty maps and targeting government interventions
using the concept o f Unmet Basic Needs (Necesidades Basicas Znsatisfechas or NBI). The INE-UDAPECenso 2001 recently provided an update o f the country’s NBI-based poverty map (2002).
In addition to this census, Bolivia’s INE has implemented over the years a number of multi-purpose household
surveys. Until 1995, INE carried out the Encuesta Zntegrada de Hogares in Bolivia’s larger cities. The key
results for the 1989-1995 period are available on CD-ROM, and standardized data files for selected years have
been prepared by CEPAL. In 1996 and 1997, INE implemented three rounds o f the Encuesta Nacional de
Empleo (June 1996, November 1996, and November 1997). These surveys had national coverage. The
November 1997 survey i s the richest in terms o f content because it contains detailed modules on education and
health.
In March 1999, INE implemented the Encuesta Continua de Hogares again in Bolivia’s larger cities. The
survey provided information on both income and, to a lesser degree, expenditures. Then, in November 1999,
INE implemented the Encuesta Continua de Hogares-Condiciones de Vida at the national level. This survey
benefited in part from the support o f the M E C O V I program. The range o f questions in this 1999 survey i s

117

more comprehensive than in previous surveys due to modules on health, education, occupation, income, and
expenditures. The module on expenditures has been particularly useful for future poverty monitoring.
These surveys are not always comparable due to changes over time in the questionnaires and the fact that some
o f surveys have only been implemented in large urban areas only, making i t difficult to establish national
poverty trends in Bolivia in the 1990s. Some additional information for rural areas i s also available in two
surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 by Bolivia’s social investment fund (Fondo de Inversion Social, FIS). But
these surveys are not fully representative o f rural areas so results should be treated with caution.
INE currently fields the Encuesta Continua de Hogares-Condiciones de Vida regularly and at a national
level. Its advantages are principally that instead o f income, expenditures are the preferred indicator o f wellbeing, and the use o f the survey to compute the cost o f basic food and non-food needs.
Since October o f 1999, Bolivia has participated in the M E C O V I (Mejoramiento de las Encuestas y la
Medicion de las Condiciones de Vida en America Latina y el Caribe) program coordinated jointly by CEPAL,

the Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank. Among its aims are to improve the system o f
household surveys, improve the use o f surveys for poverty targeting, and strengthen the institutional capacity
o f member countries to analyze the survey data for policy and project design. In Bolivia, MECOVI assisted
INE in i t s efforts to create an Integrated System o f Household Surveys as part o f the strategy o f statistical
information to combat poverty.

Success to Date in Achieving the Millennium Development Goals

Recently, Bolivia has adopted a modified version of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), aligning i t s PRSP to a set o f MDGs that best reflects i t s situation. The adoption o f the
MDGs b y Bolivia and the international community has changed the results-orientation approach
from an extensive and often ambiguous l i s t o f indicators to a more concrete selected set o f goals
and targets. The original version o f the country’s PRSP contains a broad range o f almost fifty
indicators; a revised version o f the strategy identifies a selected group o f twelve targets. In this
way, the country has taken a first step in adopting a modified version o f the MDGs by aligning
i t s PRSP to a selection of MDGs. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has been
regularly tracking the status o f the country with respect to the MDGs (see Table 1) in
conjunction with UDAPE and INE.

Progress Achieved in Introducing a Results Orientation in the Public Sector

Despite the Government’s increased focus on setting and tracking targets, there has been much
less progress made in all the supporting activities needed to make a results-based management
(RBM) system work in Bolivia. For example, there has been little connection between the
setting o f targets and the preparation o f the ministerial annual operating plans, budgetary
allocations, or the design o f externally financed development programs. An RBM approach
emphasizes the need to clarify the underlying cause and effect relations between actions and
results. However, many agencies appear to be stuck at the conceptual level o f fixing results,
without putting into place practical, operational systems to monitor intermediate indicators.

120

The findings o f a UK’s Development Strategies report on RBM in Bolivia’ are revealing. The
report argues that advances to date with a comprehensive results-based management approach
have been limited, principally because o f the difficulty o f introducing public sector reform into a
system where political patronage remains strong.
I t states that “[r]esults-based public
expenditure management i s based on a system o f performance measures, selection o f targets,
evaluation and verification and monitoring.. .. However, i t requires a minimally effective
bureaucracy, especially in personnel management, budgeting and financial controls. The
Bolivian public administration does not meet these minimum requirements.. ..”
Recently, the World Bank has been active in helping the government development operational
systems to track targets and monitor intermediate indicators. The progress to date i s discussed in
Box 2.

I Box 2. Attributing Outcomes to Policy Actions

The World Bank has been helping the government develop a system dynamics approach as a way o f
developing rather complex, graphic, structural models o f these dynamic relations in a given system easily and
intuitively. A system dynamics approach i s particularly useful since a result i s rarely due to a single action.
Even in simple cases, results depend on a multitude o f policy actions-ach
with i t s own dynamic path-that
affect outcomes within that system. The approach also allows for the representation of the dynamic aspects
o f feedback effects and time lags in a system and helps avoid the difficulty o f keeping multiple dynamic
relationships in one’s head. I t also offers important benefits for planning and for monitoring and evaluation
activities.
To date, the government and the World Bank have finished a model that analyzes the relations between health
sector policies and underlying epidemiological risks that together determine the prevalence o f malaria in the
country. The model takes into account the feedback between infected individuals and the rate o f transmission
o f the disease, as well as the actions undertaken and the government’s planned 2001-05 strategic sector plan,
and also tracks the costs and financing needs contemplated b y the plan. Socioeconomic factors that affect,
say, the responses by different groups to a diagnosis and treatment program can be factored into the model.
Similarly, exogenous factors that may affect the outcome, but may not be amenable to public policy, can be
incorporated.
Progress has also been made in modeling the relation between policy actions and infant mortality and
infectious disease outcomes. Finally, there i s an effort underway to analyze the relations between educational
policy decisions and outcomes.

C. Country Development Results and CAS Outcomes
The previous CAS proposed a set of core outcome benchmarks to “help guide, monitor and
evaluate the implementation o f the CAS during the coming five years.” Table 2 presents the
targets as originally proposed and the actual values o f the benchmarks in 2002.

Clearly, the CAS benchmarks were not met. Although the FY98-FY02 CAS stated that the
effectiveness o f the CAS should be judged by i t s ability to deliver the desired poverty reduction
results, i t i s unlikely that the poor outcomes can be attributed to the World Bank. The lack o f
progress in the core CAS benchmarks i s largely due to the difficult economic situation that
Bolivia has gone through over the last five years. During the late 1990s and early 2000, Bolivia
was hit by external and internal shocks that led to lower growth rates and stressed the private and
public sectors. The last five years have been years o f l o w growth, stagnation in poverty
reduction and increasing social conflict.
There were several external factors that turned unfavourable beginning in 1998. The Russian
crisis and the devaluation of the Brazilian real led to a sudden stop of.capita1 inflows and capital
outflows in emerging markets, decelerating growth, tarticularly among Bolivia’s trading
partners, leading to less demand for Bolivian exports.
The Argentinean crisis of 2001,
involving curtailment o f credit and a sharp devaluation o f the Argentine currency reduced
Bolivian exports to Argentina, increased competition in the domestic market from cheap
Argentine imports, and diminished remittances from Bolivian workers in Argentina. When the
external environment turned unfavourable in 1998, banks, and in particular foreign banks that
had recently acquired local banks, quickly reacted by reducing and restructuring their portfolios.
The effects of these external shocks were compounded by internal shocks caused by the
eradication o f coca crops, an aggressive campaign against smuggling as part o f the Customs
Reform-which was supported by the Bank-and by adverse weather shocks. The worsening
2 World Bank analysis shows a high correlation between the cyclical growth component o f Bolivia and its Andean
trading partners. The analysis also shows a high correlation between Bolivia’s growth and that o f Argentina and
Brazil. These results suggest there are two sources o f shocks that affect Bolivia-a direct shock that lowers
growth in Bolivia and an indirect shock that lowers growth in trading partners that leads to lower demand for
Bolivian exports. The systemic drop in capital inflows to the L A C region in the late 1990s could explain the
strong change in Bolivia’s growth.
122

economic situation has been exacerbated b y an escalating trend of social conflicts that emerged
in early 2000 and continues today.

The net effect o f these economic shocks and social conflict was a drop in the rate o f growth from
5.03 percent in 1998 to 2.8 percent in 2002 and an increase in poverty rates from 60 to 64
percent between 1999 and 2001. B y the end of the 1990s, the fiscal situation had deteriorated
due to the lag in growth and subsequent drop in tax revenues. The difficulties the public sector
faced were shared by the corporate and financial sectors, as reflected in their negative
performance indicators. Table 3 demonstrates that the actual economic performance o f key
economic indicators turned out worse than even CAS l o w case scenario projections.

In addition to the core CAS benchmarks, the 1998 CAS presented a program matrix that
contained an exhaustive list o f country performance indicators and World Bank Group selfevaluation indicators that were intended to be used to track progress, not only for the World
Bank, but also for donors and the Government. This matrix turned out to be quickly supplanted
by a reduced set o f core and complementary indicators developed jointly b y the Government and
donors that were reviewed during the C G meetings.

Although Country Performance Indicators in the CAS Program Matrix received very little
follow-up because they were so soon replaced by a different set, Attachment Table 1 attempts to
report on progress towards meeting the original targets. In retrospect, the task o f comparing
actual outcomes to the targets proved exceedingly difficult. Many targets were not quantified.
Others were difficult to measure. Some can only be measured with census data that i s reported
every 10 years. Moreover, because the Government and donors chose to track a different set o f
country performance indicators, the country performance indicators in the CAS Program Matrix
were not actively tracked and the Bank indicators were not updated when the nature o f the
lending program changed.

123

Based on what could be reviewed, the performance in meeting targets was decidedly mixed. In
the equity area, many of the targets were met. A greater emphasis on social policies was
followed by a greater allocation of resources and an observed impact on social indicators. Social
expenditure increased from 15.7 percent o f GDP in 1998 to 19.6 percent in 2002, and the
efficiency and quality of social services improved as well. The introduction and implementation
o f the health reform has led to an important increase in coverage across priority indicators-i.e.
births attended b y trained personnel, complete pre-natal care attendance, administration of
DPT/Pentavalent vaccine. Indeed, the impact of the Bank’s assistance in the health sector has
been remarkable. In the education sector, the impact o f the Bank’s assistance has also been
strong. Drawing upon advances made by the previous administration, the Government managed
to push forward a transformation o f both the institutional and technical-pedagogical aspects o f
the education system. Net primary coverage has reached 96.4 percent and the primary
completion rate reached 72.7 percent with an annual increase o f two percentage points per year,
placing Bolivia on track to achieve universal primary education by 2015.
However, on the macro front, over the last CAS period the Bank underestimated the limited
ability o f the economy to withstand shocks. Moreover, the fiscal imbalance was reinforced by
the deterioration o f the banking and corporate sectors, which added to the problems created b y
the pension system reform, putting the fiscal framework on a non-sustainable, explosive path.
Finally, the objective o f poverty reduction was not achieved, and the system o f safety nets
proved inflexible and unable to protect the most vulnerable groups in the events o f unexpected
shocks. While the Bank carried out a useful study on the microeconomic constraints to growth,
the lending program over the past CAS period did not address the bottlenecks that impede higher
growth .

With regard to institutional reforms and decentralization, achievements are mixed. There was
progress in consolidating reforms in three key public agencies: the National Customs Service, the
Tax Services and the National Roads Service. Between 1998 and 2001, tax revenues collected
b y the Tax Service increased from 7.48 percent to 10.9 percent o f GDP and, during the same
period, more than 20,000 public employees in the upper and middle levels o f government
presented a sworn statement of their personal goods. In the judicial sector, important laws were
approved to deal with criminal procedures and the c i v i l code. A C i v i l Service Statute was
approved and a C i v i l Service Superintendency was created. SIGMA-an integrated financial
management system-has been implemented in the whole central administration and w i l l be
soon implemented at the departmental and municipal levels.
There remains, however, important aspects o f both S I G M A and the PRI that are s t i l l pending,
including extending the implementation o f S I G M A to Municipalities and Prefectures that w i l l
require further evaluation to determine their financial, technical, and institutional sustainability
over time. Institutional reforms succeeded in three key autonomous agencies (national roads,
customs and tax services), however, the core o f the public sector remains largely unreformed and
s t i l l suffers from deep institutional weakness. Taking into account institutional constraints
within the judicial branch, the Bank decided to drop i t s support aimed at strengthening the
judicial system.
Regarding decentralization, the WBG plays, through the CAS and i t s lending instruments, an
important role to unify donor support to the area of fiscal and administrative decentralization in
Bolivia. There are three important lessons that can be learned from the experience to date. First,
while implementation o f the program supported by specific operation (e.g. the PSAC-I) has been,
124

in general, satisfactory, and basic institutional arrangements for decentralization established at
the outset o f the program are in place, continued efforts are needed in the areas o f reinforcing the
incentive structure and system o f administrative controls to address the core aspects of the
decentralization process, including the need for fiscal discipline, clear lines o f responsibility
among the levels o f public administration, and the involvement o f civil society stakeholders in
the delivery and oversight o f services at the local level. The programmatic adjustment approach
provides a good instrument for continuing such support. Second, the new government i s using
the flexibility o f the programmatic approach to improve the institutional arrangements for
decentralization-including establishing the ComitC de Analisis de Descentralizacih (CAD) and
rethinking the role o f the FPS-and provide the basis for the soon-to-be finalized National
Decentralization Strategy. Third, the centrality o f decentralization within the Bolivian Poverty
Reduction Strategy and the challenges inherent to operations with multiple partners and
government stakeholders require a high level o f donor and WBG coordination and intense
supervision o f the government’s decentralization program.

IFC Accomplishments since last CAS
Despite the adverse social and economic conditions that prevailed during the past few years, the
implementation o f IFC’s strategy has been strong in supporting the Bolivian private sector
during one o f the most difficult periods in recent history. The 1998 CASPSS articulated IFC’s
main areas o f focus: (i)
financial sector development; (ii)
support for S M E s and microenterprises
through financial intermediaries; (iii)
private infrastructure; (iv) support for general industry,
including export-oriented enterprises in manufacturing, gas, and mining; and (v) non-investment
activity to improve the business environment.

As o f October 31, 2003, IFC’s portfolio (outstanding loans, syndicated loans and equity) stood at
US$lOS million. Three-quarters o f the portfolio consisted o f infrastructure projects, including
transportation, power, water infrastructure, and telecommunications, while the rest consisted o f
the financial sector, mining, and chemicals. IFC’s support has been strong relative to the size o f
the economy. During FY99-FY04 (through October 2003), I F C committed to financing for 12
projects for US$132 million, including syndications, focusing on the IFC’s CAS priority areas
and following on the Bank’s work in the relevant sectors.
The relatively small size o f projects in the industrial sector has been a constraint for direct I F C
investment. B y providing six credit lines (including the four new lines approved in FY03) in the
financial sector for non-lending to S M E s and microenterprises, IFC has been able on a wholesale
basis to reach smaller companies while supporting financial institutions. Support for private
infrastructure has been provided through projects in electricity, soybean-shipping port, railway,
telecommunications, and water and sanitation, capitalizing on the early gains in Bank supported
regulatory reform. The river port project, combined with the privatized railway (through an IFCsupported railway project in Chile) from Santa Cruz to Puerto Suarez, i s supporting shipment o f
increased soybean production thereby revitalizing the rural economy. F I A S provided assistance
in regulatory and administrative barriers to investment, and the Bank-IFC joint S M E Department
carried out an “ S M E mapping” a study for diagnosing and addressing existing constraints to
S M E development. This study combined with the Bank’s “Microeconomic Constraints” study
are now feeding into several initiatives to have a more targeted and efficient approach to provide
assistance to microenterprises and SMEs. Building partly on these works, I F C launched a
regional S M E Facility approved b y the Board in June 2003 to provide technical assistance and
125

capacity building programs for microenterprises and SMEs, initially covering Bolivia, Peru,
Honduras and Nicaragua.

D. Measuring Bank Performance
Portfolio Assessment

Between FY98-FY02 there has been a rationalization o f the Bank’s portfolio. The number o f
projects decreased from 21 in FY98 to 17 as o f October 2003. Between FY99 and FYOl, there
was a sharp deterioration in the quality o f the portfolio. As o f end-FYOl Bolivia had 35 percent
o f i t s commitments at risk (compared to 7 percent as o f end-FY99) and had 24 percent o f i t s
projects at risk. As a result o f the increase in the riskiness o f the portfolio, in FY02 Bolivia was
added to the l i s t of PIP (Portfolio Improvement Program) countries, subject to intensive portfolio
monitoring and supervision. Between August 200 1 and June 2002, bi-monthly follow-up
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews took place in Bolivia. An action plan identifying
critical steps, responsible unithector and target dates was prepared. I t focused on restructuring
some problem projects, ensuring the availability o f counterpart funds, monitoring bidding
processes, tracking overall disbursements and carrying out some project-specific actions. Five
quantitative benchmarks and targets related to portfolio monitoring indicators were set for FY02.
One year later, a strong improvement in portfolio indicators was followed by the removal o f the
country from the improvement program. Bolivia’s portfolio performance went beyond the targets
set under the PIP. In FY02, the percentage o f commitments at risk were less than half the target
o f 20 percent established in the action plan, while the percentage o f projects at risk dropped from
24 percent in FYOl to 11 percent in FY02 and the proactivity index increased from 0 to 100
percent. Table 4 presents a comparative view of the portfolio performance over the last CAS
period. There has been a deterioration o f the portfolio in FY03, with a sharp increase in the
number o f risk flags from 7 in FY02 to 28 in FY03 (40 percent are related to procurement and
project management).

Quality of Products and Services

OED evaluated 21 projects that exited between FY98 and FY03. Regarding Bank performance,
about 81 percent of the projects evaluated are rated as satisfactory, only one o f the projects has a
highly satisfactory record and three were rated unsatisfactory. Regarding portfolio management,
Bolivia projects were only part o f the sample in 2000 for Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA),
both projects were rated satisfactory at entry. Results are encouraging, but i t i s worth mention
that during FY03 (not reflected in Table 5) one Bolivia project was sampled for QEA and
received only a marginally satisfactory rating. Between FY97 and FY03, ten projects were
selected for a Quality at Supervision Assessment and in FYOl two projects were evaluated as
part o f the Quality at Supervision o f risky projects, 82 percent were satisfactorily supervised.

Delivery
Approvals over the entire FY99-FY02 period equalled US$373 million, which lies between the
base case o f US$325 million and the high case o f US$450 o f the 1998 CAS. I t i s worth noting
that the nature o f the projects changed somewhat over the course o f the CAS period from what
had been planned at the beginning o f the period. Table 7 compares actual t o planned projects, i t
can be clearly seen that a number o f projects were dropped or delayed. In fact, only five of the 18
proposed projects were actually carried out, reflecting the adaptation o f the Bank’s program o f
support to the economic, social and political circumstances faced by the country. For instance,
the series o f municipal development projects were replaced by a series o f PSACs in
decentralization in order to tackle issues within the whole system o f decentralization instead o f
providing support to stand-alone municipal projects. Similarly, a Judicial Reform project was
dropped in face o f political constraints and a Secondary and Higher Education Reform project
was dropped due to difficulties in carrying out two major reforms in the education sector -the
Education Reform Program was being implemented in primary. The introduction o f a Social
Safety N e t SAC in FY03 responded to the urgent need to provide immediate response to the
current social and economic crisis in Bolivia. I t helped the Government to close a financing gap
in 2003 while guaranteeing the provision o f basic social services during the period o f fiscal
adjustment.
The approval o f only one project for US$5 million in fiscal year 2000 stands out. This occurred
as the result o f an explicit decision b y the Bank not to go forward with additional projects until
the Government proceeded with the institutionalization o f the National Road Service. This
decision reflects the seriousness that Bank attached to institutional development with the
launching o f the CDF. Other changes included: (i)the replacement o f a proposed series o f
investment projects in municipal development for a far-ranging Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Credit in decentralization; (ii)dropping a secondary and higher education standalone project in favour o f modifying the existing Education Reform project to incorporate a
program o f initial reforms in higher education (given resistance to higher education reforms
within the universities, this approach was adopted to promote a low-key, home-grown demand
for change); (iii)
dropping a Judicial Reform project and two other institutional reform projects,
given the difficulties in obtaining progress in this area; (iv) replacing two stand-alone highway
projects with a single road rehabilitation and maintenance project because i t was felt that this
project was likely to have greater impact; and (v) dropping two rural investment projects as a

128

result of experiences with corruption in the Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino, one of the main
executing agencies for rural development.
The planned lending program for FY03 was presented to the Board in the CAS Progress Report
o f M a y 2001. The actual lending program for FY03 departed from the original plans because o f
the need to respond to the economic, political and social crisis that had been building over the
last several years and which came to a head in the violent protests in February 2003. In
particular, the Social Protection Project was designed to protect essential social expenditures,

Appropriateness of Instruments and Fiduciary Issues

The use of APLs was appropriate given the strong emphasis on long-term institutional reform.
L I L s are being used effectively to test new approaches (Indigenous People Development) and to
address specific issues in sectors where the Bank has limited interventions (Hydrocarbons).
Significant attention was given to fiduciary issues. The results o f the C F A A and the CPAR were
included as benchmarks o f an adjustment operation (PSAC I).

E. Consultation
Over the last CAS period the Bank’s program o f support was entirely aligned with the
government’s development plan, first to the National Action Plan and later to the country’s
PRSP. Both o f them resulted from broad consultation processes, the First and Second National
Dialogues, respectively. This section will discuss the government’s efforts to move towards more
open and participatory policy planning. .
In 1997, the Government convened National Dialogues that brought together different sectors o f
society to discuss Government plans and public policy objectives. Subsequent and successive
rounds o f this National Dialogue were envisioned; each expected to build upon the results o f the
previous rounds.
In October o f 1997, the Government convened the First National Dialogue that brought together
representatives from the business community, the church, civil society organizations, labor
groups, NGOs, and universities, with the Government and opposition parties also participating.
Despite some shortcomings, the dialogue produced various positive outcomes and resulted in
agreements to support a program to reduce poverty and boost economic growth. This led to the
National Action Plan mentioned in previous sections. Against this backdrop, the Government
prioritized social spending and began implementing programs aimed at alleviating poverty and
improving the living conditions o f the population. Although the Government made substantial
efforts to implement this strategy, little follow-up was done before the inauguration o f the second
National Dialogue in 2000. A multi-disciplinary group was also convened to work on a proposal
to fight poverty. In September o f 1998, the group published a document identifying actions to
fight the root causes o f poverty and underdevelopment. The document noted that the main
assurance that these actions would be implemented was the capacity o f Bolivian society to take
responsibility for carrying them out (an idea that became a principal objective o f the second
National Dialogue in 2000).

The Second National Dialogue was launched in April o f 2000 to promote a participatory
approach in the preparation o f Bolivia’s PRSP. In the months preceding the dialogue, various
civil society groups mobilized on their own to prepare their own dialogues. This included the
catholic church-sponsored jubilee 2000 forum o f NGOs and included groups representing small
producers, indigenous people and miners. The Second National Dialogue was designed as a
bottom-up process with discussions taking place first at the municipal level, and then moving to
the regional and national level^.^ Four topics were discussed at the municipal roundtables:
determinants of poverty, mechanisms for the allocation o f HIPC debt relief resources, citizens’
3. A total o f 1,215 people from 314 municipalities participated in the municipal roundtables, while there were 935
people in the departmental roundtables and 273 people in the national roundtable.

participation in monitoring the use of HIPC resources, and carrying out a follow-up o f the
national dialogue. The nine departmental roundtables included delegates from each o f the
municipal roundtables, as well as representatives from the government, civil society and the
Jubilee 2000 forum o f NGOs. But high-level government participation in these departmental
roundtables was limited, with government officials present at only three o f the nine roundtables.
The meetings focused on priority actions at the regional level in the fight against poverty, as well
as citizens’ participation in the monitoring o f resources for public investment, the content and
institutional framework o f public policies, and conducting a follow-up o f the National Dialogue.
In August o f 2000, delegates from the municipal and departmental roundtables attended the
national dialogue with the attendance o f government ministers and vice-ministers as well as
representatives o f c i v i l society. However, representation o f political parties and the legislature
was very low. Six sectoral topics were discussed: support to production, education, health, basic
sanitation and housing, land, and the environment. Some structural issues were also discussed
including tax policy, labor reform, trade policy, and the regulatory environment for businesses.
Agreements were reached on several topics, including: (i)the determination o f priority policy
areas (such as productive infrastructure and support for production, education, health, and land
tenure); (ii)
the definition o f a mechanism for the distribution o f HIPC resources; and (iii)
the
need to establish social oversight mechanisms which would give c i v i l society a role in
monitoring the utilization o f HIPC resources.

The Government drafted the PRSP based on the results o f the Second National Dialogue. The
document was shared with the general public, followed by public discussions o f the draft. As a
result, the document was revised in several areas to include a more extensive analysis o f
indigenous, gender, and environmental issues. Plans were then made for an extensive follow-up
to the PRSP through existing mechanisms o f social oversight at the municipal level, and through
newly created agencies o f social oversight at the departmental and national levels. This entire
review process was formalized in the new National Dialogue Law (Ley de Dialog0 Nacional).
But despite these efforts to bring the participatory process closer to people b y decentralizing it,
NGOs and c i v i l society groups raised various concerns over whether: (i)some consultations
were unduly influenced by local decision-makers; (ii)
vulnerable groups were under-represented
(specifically women and indigenous people); (iii)
the highly structured methodology used failed
to promote real participation; and (iv) the agenda o f the discussions was not sufficiently flexible.
Nevertheless, most observers agreed that the Government made a good faith effort at utilizing a
participatory approach in developing i t s strategy and laid the groundwork for an on-going
participatory process for monitoring i t s strategy.

F. Coordination
With regards to donor coordination and partnership, there have been important advances over the
last years. The Consultative Group meetings, the introduction o f the government’s Nuevo Marc0
de Relacionamiento entre el Gobiemo y la Cooperaci6n Zntemacional, the CDF, and specificsector practices have all improved donor coordination. Over the past CAS period there have been
important efforts aimed at increasing coordination among donors. An effective in-country forum
for partner coordination was temporarily in place, and donor assistance programs were aligned
with the country National Action Plan. The system o f donor coordination functioned in such a
way that one aid agency had to be elected to represent the donor community and to work with a

131

representative o f the Government in each one o f the four pillars. Government participation in
donor-government Consultative Group meetings increased, and steps have been taken in moving
away from traditional donor-driven and freestanding projects toward broader sector wide
approaches that support national goals.
The introduction o f the CDF allowed the Bank to play an important role in the donor
coordination effort. In supporting the implementation o f country programs, the Bank worked
closely with other donors. The extensive use o f co-financing and technical assistance trust funds
has strongly supported the CAS implementation. In FY03 TF disbursements o f $20.5 million
placed Bolivia as the biggest country user o f trust funds in the Region. Similarly, there have been
several good practices in co-financing and joint coordination o f supervision. For instance, the
Institutional Reform Program was jointly prepared between the Government and a group o f
donors, while there were joint supervision missions o f the Education Reform Project. But despite
these major advances, the assistance o f the donor community i s s t i l l disperse and fragmented,
and efforts at rationalizing overlapping investments and harmonizing operational practices are
s t i l l pending.

G. Overall Assessment of the Performance of the CAS
Bank management rates the overall performance o f the assistance program as satisfactory over
the last CAS period. The Bank did particularly well in the social sectors. I t introduced a Health
Reform Program that pioneered a successful results orientation and advanced well in the two
Education Projects, with close coordination with the other donors. A separate component
dealing with needed reforms in the Higher Education Sector was introduced, with no additional
preparation budget, and the Bank was instrumental in convincing other donors to provide
additional financing to basic education to replace the funds directed to Higher Education Reform.
Over the CAS period, the Bank also advanced reasonably well in Institutional Reform. The
Bank’s decision to hold up all new lending until there was serious reform in the National Roads
Service (which resulted in one year when only $5 million in new projects was approved)
provided a very clear signal of how seriously the Bank took the issue o f institutional reform.
Largely as a result o f this action, the National Roads Service was reformed and, though i t i s
subject to attempts to introduce political interference, remains today very much better than i t has
been in the past. Other advances in customs and tax administration, supported by the World
Bank Institutional Reform Project, are also noteworthy. Finally, in the area o f institutional
reform and governance the Bank made effective use o f i t s Anti-fraud and Anti-corruption unit to
identify cases o f corruption that resulted in the conviction and incarceration o f those involved.
Less success was apparent in the institutional reforms dealing with the Ministries and many o f
the gains did not survive the transition o f administration in 2002.
The Bank also made a strong effort to follow through on the principles o f the CDF. I t organized
the Country Office around three o f the government’s four pillars and decentralized staff to the
field. Progress was made in country procurement procedures, culminating in a new procurement
decree that w i l l make i t easier for donors to harmonize around the improved country procedures.
The Bank was also proactive when the portfolio deteriorated and successfully oversaw a
Performance Improvement Plan that turned around the quality of the portfolio within a relatively
short time.
132

The Bank was relatively less successful in the area o f private sector development. The Bank did
carry out a useful study on Microeconomic Constraints to Growth and the results of that study
were picked up by the government’s Productivity and Competitiveness Unit that was created
within the Ministry of Economic Development.

Annex H

In parallel with the preparation o f this CAS, IDA i s supporting the new Government in i t s
transition through an emergency assistance package defined to contribute to the country’s urgent
short-term financing needs while also assisting with small, focused, and visible social sector
investments.

This emergency package comprises of the following instruments: i) a $14 million
Emergency Economic Recovery Project, discussed at the Board in December 2003, designed to
provide quick disbursing financing against a positive l i s t o f goods in order to assist the
Government o f Bolivia; ii)the advance release o f the pending second tranche o f $10 million o f
the existing Social Safety Net SAC, conceived as a mechanism to protect priority social
expenditures after the February crisis, and sent to the Board for No Objection in December 2003;
iii)the acceleration o f an existing operation in the portfolio, the Bolivia Institutional Reform
project, with $20 million envisaged to be directed towards funding o f wages and salaries o f c i v i l
servant hired through competitive and transparent mechanisms in pilot agencies; and iv)
reassigning funds from ongoing I D A operations ($5.6 million before March 2004) to support
small but visible social investment projects in the L a Paz and El Alto municipalities.
For this last activity, country management has identified sources o f available funds from
projects presently active in the Bolivia portfolio that lie within existing project objectives (no
Board approval required), including Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance (PO-68968), Health
Reform (PO-60392) and Education Quality and Equity Strengthening (PO-06204). The total
amount o f redirected funds amounts to $5.7 million, with an additional $14 million to be
disbursed from the Road project after March 2004. Table 1 below summarizes the details o f this
emergency package component, which the Bank w i l l finance in line with i t s fiduciary guidelines.
The Government and the donor community have been consulted on this final l i s t and are
supportive o f it.
