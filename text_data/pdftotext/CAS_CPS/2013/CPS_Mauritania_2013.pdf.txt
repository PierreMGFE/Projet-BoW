EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.

Mauritania is one of the high-growth countries in the region and with the right
policies and political stability can substantially reduce poverty, accelerate growth and boost
prosperity over the next decade. Mauritania is mostly a desert country, with a population
of about 3.5 million and a GDP per capita of about US$1,160 (2012). As in many African
countries, Mauritania’s recent mineral discoveries have buttressed growth and raised incomes.
The mining sector has very strong potential. With more than 11 million tons exported in 2011
(valued at about US$1.5 billion), the country is one of the largest exporters of iron ore in Africa,
and output is expected to increase to 18 million tons by 2015. Mauritania also exports gold and
copper and has significant potential for more mineral production. In addition, Mauritania has
become a modest offshore oil producer, and there are other prospects, for more gas in particular.
Mauritania’s waters have some of the most abundant fish stocks in the world. Industrial fishing
exports 800,000 tons of fish per year and artisanal fishing catches are about 80,000 tons per year.
Mauritania is also a significant livestock-producing country and has a strong potential for
irrigated agriculture along the Senegal River under the regional Senegal River Basin
Organization (OMVS). Mauritania’s ability to manage these resources and use the corresponding
revenues in an inclusive manner will be key for its economic and social development.

ii.
Mauritania is slowly emerging from its internal governance crisis. Following the
successful presidential elections of July 2009, the international community lifted sanctions
imposed following the 2008 coup, and the new transitional national unity government has
articulated its growth and poverty reduction agenda in the country’s third Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP-3) for 2011-2015. GDP growth is estimated at 6.9 percent in 2012,
compared to an average of 4.15 percent in 2010-2011. The outlook for 2013 and the medium
term is positive, with GDP growth projected at 6.2 percent. Reserves stand at 6.7 months of
imports (end-2012). Recent debt sustainability analysis shows that Mauritania has a moderate
risk of debt distress, with total public debt at 84 percent of GDP.
iii.
For Mauritania to realize its full potential, it must confront a number of severe
domestic and external challenges. There are important disparities between urban and rural
areas, but overall inequality is moderate. In rural areas, where 78 percent of the poor reside,
the poverty rate remained deeply entrenched at 59 percent between 2004 and 2008. In urban
areas, by contrast, poverty declined from 28.9 percent to 20.8 percent. In absolute terms, the
number of poor remained constant at 1.3 million because of population growth. Poverty
incidence varies significantly across regions. It is lowest in the main towns of Nouakchott and
Nouadhibou (16-19 percent) and the surrounding regions (32-37 percent). Poverty is highest
(above 60 percent) in two of the regions bordering the Senegal River, Gorgol and Brakna, which
together account for 30 percent of the poor. However, inequality is only moderate; the Gini
coefficient was estimated at 0.38 in 2008, essentially the same as in 2004 (0.39). The bottom 20
percent enjoyed significant increases in consumption – higher than increases for the non-poor –
between 2000 and 2004, suggesting an inclusive pattern of growth. However, this pattern was
reversed in the 2004-08 period, as growth was driven more by extractive industries.
iv.

Vulnerability to external shocks remains a threat. More than 70 percent of current
cereal consumption is imported. Mauritania’s environment, land and fishery resources are under
increasing pressure as droughts become more frequent. In addition, Mauritania has yet to reap
the benefits of its unique geographic and cultural location, sandwiched between the Sahelian
i

countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb. Strong ethnic and tribal linkages are often a
source of tension, and the population remains fragmented into three main groups. More recently,
the country has been affected by global security threats. Starting in 2006, terrorist attacks and
hostage taking by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) began to affect Mauritania – adding
to the problems resulting from illegal immigration and drug trafficking through the Sahara
desert. The recent crisis in neighboring Mali has further compounded these security concerns.
v.

With both increasing discoveries of mineral resources and some political stability,
now is the time for the new Government to translate its natural resource wealth into
inclusive growth. If well managed, Mauritania’s natural and mineral resources could provide the
means to increase incomes at an accelerated pace, reduce inequality, and boost prosperity.
However, achieving this will require that Mauritania builds its road, energy and irrigation
infrastructure; improve the business climate to attract private investment; and develop a labor
force with the skills to make the mining, fishery, and agriculture sectors more globally
competitive. Mauritania will also have to build stronger ties with its neighbors. The five years of
the PRSP-3 period, which largely coinciding with the CPS period (2014-2016), will be a critical
opportunity to deepen some of the essential reforms needed to create jobs and improve
resilience.

vi.

The FY14-17 CPS supports the areas of the PRSP-3 in which the Bank Group has a
comparative advantage. The program will be organized along two main pillars, which include
both ongoing Bank Group activities and proposed new operations:
a. Pillar 1 – Growth and Diversification would aim at increasing productivity and
expanding the productive base of the economy by supporting infrastructure
development, promoting the private sector, and strengthening the financial sector. It
would also identify ways to trigger more inclusive growth linked to the thriving
mining industry, and help to unleash the potential of the fishery and agriculture
sectors.
b.

Pillar 2 – Economic Governance and Service Delivery would focus on improving
public sector performance, with special emphasis on local government performance
strengthening and food security. In addition to continuing efforts in the area of
education and skills formation, the Bank would promote increased access to basic
social services, and greater efficiency of safety net programs.

vii.

The CPS is informed by the WBG’s overall strategic goals. In a country like
Mauritania where extreme poverty is still at 23 percent, the WBG aims at promoting the
eradication of poverty. Given the predominantly rural nature of poverty, agricultural
productivity improvement and strengthening enrollment in basic education will be a cornerstone
of any poverty reduction strategy. However, ultimately many people will have to move to urban
areas, so private sector development will also be key. A vital complement will be judicious use
of natural resource rents in education, social safety nets and infrastructure. The proposed CPS
will play an important role in this effort, notably through support to agriculture and fishing, the
creation of a targeted safety net system, and the decentralization of service delivery. Capacitybuilding on statistics, including support for the next household poverty survey and the poverty
assessment study will improve understanding of the causes, characteristics, and spatial
distribution of poverty.

ii

viii.
IFC will support private sector initiatives, especially in the infrastructure, banking,
and agribusiness sectors. To ensure that economic growth is inclusive and sustainable, the
focus will be on SME capacity building. In this regard IFC has started rolling out Business Edge
training programs in Mauritania. IFC will also support investment climate reforms alongside the
Business Environment Enhancement Project (BEEP), with a focus on simplifying the procedures
for starting a business by implementing a one-stop shop, by paying taxes, and improving SMEs’
access to credit, including by supporting creation of a credit bureau. In addition, IFC has
identified other financial institutions that could increase SME and trade financing. IFC also plans
to finance the expansion and diversification of a local dairy company, which will have a direct
impact the revenues of more than 2500 MSMEs. In the past, MIGA’s activities have mainly
focused on TA in the financial sector. Going forward, MIGA will use its guarantee products,
joining IFC and the Bank across the private sector, with particular attention given to developing
PPPs in key sectors such as energy and transport infrastructure.
ix.
The proposed program design is based on the assumption of an IDA-16 allocation of
SDR43.2 million, equivalent to US$65 million, followed by (anticipated, approximate) IDA-17
annual allocations for FY15 and FY16 of US$20 million for each year (assuming the IDA-17
allocation remains the same as the IDA-16 allocation). This would amount to a total CPS
envelope for new IDA lending of US$102 million, supplemented by additional IDA allocations
for regional projects, and other WBG products where possible. Additional resources would be
leveraged through other donors. It should be emphasized that IDA’s role is shifting from a
primarily financing one to more of a catalytic role, using IDA resources to leverage government
financing and other development partners’ participation in sectors where IDA is present.
x.
The CPS has been prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, and
will be complemented by renewed efforts on donor coordination, including: (a) sharing
information on sector strategies, with joint funding of programs and projects; (b) providing
feedback on implementation and generic portfolio issues for ongoing operations; and (c)
undertaking joint coordinated efforts in communicating with the Government and other
stakeholders.
xi.
Implementation of the new CPS could face three major risks: (a) regional political
instability; (b) lack of implementation capacity in the Government; and (c) vulnerability to
external shocks. The second and third risks would be mitigated by continuing to build consensus
throughout Mauritania on the objectives, content, and approach of the specific programs
supported by ongoing Bank activities and by proposed new operations, complemented by
support from other development partners, including the IMF. The risk of political instability
would be monitored closely in cooperation with the regional and international entities, such as
ECOWAS, the African Union and EU, all of which are involved in regional stability, in
particular with respect to the conflict in Mali. All operations would include a capacity-building
component.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

1.1. Political and Social Context
1.
Mauritania is currently recovering from a succession of internal shocks over the
past several years that deeply affected its political environment and economic performance.
After a bloodless military coup in 2005 followed by a democratic transition in 2006-2007, the
new Government engaged in a constructive dialogue with development partners to launch its
development program. With an agenda focusing on economic governance – a clear break from
earlier practices – Mauritania was granted debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country
Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and a new Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was approved by the IMF, all in 2007. However, in
August 2008, the new civilian president was removed from office by another military coup. The
political crisis led the international community to put most of its activities in Mauritania on hold.
The World Bank, in accordance with OP/BP 7.30 (Dealings with De Facto Governments), also
suspended its activities, and only started reengaging in September 2009, following the successful
presidential elections 1 of July 2009, which led to the establishment of a national unity
government and the lifting of international sanctions. In March 2010, the IMF approved a threeyear Extended Credit Facility (ECF) agreement for about US$118.1 million. Economic recovery
was discussed at the Brussels Round Table in June 2010, at which time total pledges of US$3.2
billion (including US$365 million from the World Bank Group) were made for 2010-2015. As of
end 2012, roughly three quarters of this amount had materialized.
2.
The country nevertheless remains vulnerable to political instability. Lingering
questions about the legitimacy of past elections, domestic social tensions, and the rebellion in
northern Mali all combine to create a high degree of political risk. The opposition of groups of
African-Mauritanians 2 to the civil census launched in 2011 has added to the tensions. The
municipal and legislative elections initially scheduled for end-2011 have been postponed, but an
agreement has been reached between the Government and the opposition on the creation of an
independent electoral commission and more liberalization of the media. 3
3.
Mauritania is also affected by global security threats. Starting in 2006, some terrorist
attacks and hostage-taking by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) began to affect
Mauritania, adding to the problems resulting from illegal immigration and drug trafficking
through the Sahara desert. These security problems have damaged Mauritania’s image as a safe
country for foreigners – investors as well as tourists. The Government has started to devote more
resources to addressing those issues, cooperating actively with other countries of the region and
the international community. The recent crisis in neighboring Mali has further compounded the
security concerns. The north of the country, especially at the Mali border, remains tense. This
region has a high concentration of mercenary factions involved in the Arab Spring, insurgent
groups, and refugees, mainly Tuareg. There were more than 65,000 refugees registered in the
country as of September 2012.
1
The Constitutional Court and the international community recognized the results of the elections, which had been monitored by
international observers. Former general Ould Abdel Aziz won with 52 percent of the votes.
2
Moors (Beydane Arabic speaking), black African Mauritanians (speaking a variety of other languages), and Haratins
(descendants of former enslaved dark-skinned Africans speaking Arabic, culturally closer to the Moors).
3
Notably, Mauritania has significantly improved its ranking on the Press Freedom Index to 67 out 179 countries for 2011-2012.

1

4.
The country has also experienced significant structural changes – a sharp decline in
the importance of agriculture, due mostly to repeated droughts; and a massive rural-urban
exodus, which has drastically reduced the share of nomads in the population and increased the
share of the urban population to more than 40 percent. 4 Urbanization has compounded demands
for educational, housing, employment, health, administrative, and other services, and led to the
breakdown of traditional social protection structures. Moreover, the population remains
fragmented along ethnic and tribal lines among three main groups. 5 Income disparities have
grown between privileged groups (anchored on a class of traders and the military) and the rest of
the population, and have fostered wealth redistribution within a clientelistic system (see Box 1).
Box 1: Social and Political Challenges
One of the major challenges in Mauritania is to ensure that recent macroeconomic success leads to broad-based and
equitable growth, and does not exacerbate the social and political tensions arising from:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Cultural identity and social relations built around clans and families;
A history of violent change of power and limited democratic processes;
Insecure land tenure;
A rent-driven economy that favors economic clientelism and patronage; and
Rapid urbanization, which has created pauperization; and
Spatial division along ethnic and religious lines.

To achieve inclusive growth, the Government must pay special attention, in its policies and programs, to (a)
marginalized groups and ethnic/tribal complexities; (b) traditional conflict resolution mechanisms and local
justice, as these are the mechanisms most used by the local population especially the poor; (c) access to justice in
land disputes in a manner that combines respect for traditional rights with a modern land registry system; (d) issues
of youth exclusion and unemployment, especially in urban areas, which have the potential to increase religious
extremism and violence among marginalized groups; and (e) the inclusion of civil society in decision-making, to
increase citizens’ stake in democratic governance.

5.
Mauritania’s Human Development Index improved from 0.42 in 2007 to 0.45 in
2011 (compared to an average of 0.46 for Sub-Saharan Africa), and it now ranks 159th out of 187
countries. The rate of population growth declined to an estimated 2.5 percent in 2011, from 2.7
percent in 2005. There has been progress in the social sectors, but overall results in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been mixed (see Annex 5). MDGs regarding
universal primary education and gender equality in primary education appear achievable in light
of the significant progress already realized in school enrollment. The gross primary enrollment
rate has reached 100 percent, and gender balance has been attained in primary and secondary
schools. The MDG related to access to water is within reach if stronger efforts are made.
6.
Important deficiencies in achieving the health-related MDGs persist. MDGs related
to child and maternal health will not be within reach under current policies; infant-child mortality
is still at 122/1000 versus a target of 45/1000, and maternal mortality is at 560 per 100,000 live
births against an MDG target of 232. Only 60 percent of births are assisted, and child vaccination
coverage is 64 percent. Performance in the sector has been compromised by the underfunding of
priority interventions (tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive health, infectious disease control,

maternal and child health and nutrition), weak expenditure management, poor inter-sectoral
collaboration (in water, sanitation, and nutrition), insufficient community participation, and no
real strategies to stimulate demand for preventive and basic health services.
7.
While some gender indicators have improved, progress has been constrained by
cultural, social, and economic barriers and by the failure to use human rights approaches
to respond to the strategic and practical needs of women and men. In recent years, the
Government has shown strong commitment to gender equality. It has ratified most international
juridical instruments relating to women; set up an institutional framework to maintain women’s
fundamental humans rights (Personal Status Code); and approved a new Gender-Based Violence
Law in 2011. However, much more needs to be done to foster women’s economic
empowerment.
8.
Mauritania’s environment and natural resources are under increasing pressure from
climate change, urban population growth, and economic development. Mauritania has a fragile
climate, with inadequate rainfall to support crop production in most of the country. This situation
is aggravated by poor environmental governance; Mauritania was ranked 161st out of 163
countries in the 2010 Environmental Performance Index. The degradation of ecosystems and
decrease in biodiversity are harming rural populations and affecting their income-generating
activities. The poorest people, who are already the most severely affected, will become
increasingly vulnerable to floods and droughts. The recent droughts have brought to the forefront
the need to move from crisis response to the sustainable and resilient development of dry lands.
Coastal zones are also extremely vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly storm surges, floods,
and coastal erosion. This may affect the prospects of the existing oil and the new gas fields off
the coast of Nouakchott, the capital. Rapidly growing coastal urban centers, critical
infrastructure, and economic activities in ecologically sensitive areas tend to increase the risks.
Despite these challenges, Mauritania’s significant natural resources can be used to support
progress toward its development and poverty reduction goals.

Poverty Profile and Trends

9.
The dual structure of Mauritania's economy presents a formidable challenge to
poverty reduction, with (a) a natural resource-based, capital-intensive modern enclave economy
serving as an engine for export growth but having little direct impact on the population; and (b) a
subsistence economy supporting half of the population, based mainly on rain fed livestock
raising, some farming and related activities, traditional fishing, and small-scale commerce. The
enclave economy has generated high and consistent rents, providing finance for development and
infrastructure, but has only limited links with the subsistence economy. Raw mineral exports
involve limited linkages to the domestic economy, and given the capital-intensive nature of
extraction activities, the sector’s demand for labor is modest.
10.
Poverty still affects a major part of Mauritania’s population, particularly in rural
areas. According to the most recent poverty assessment (2008 household data), poverty
remained at about 46.5 percent between 2000 and 2004 before declining to 42 percent in 2008.
Extreme poverty, as measured at the US$1.25 per day line, was estimated at 23 percent in 2008.
Poverty incidence is unlikely to have improved much since 2008, given the slow rate of GDP
growth resulting from the 2009 political shock and the 2011 climatic shock. Using the growth
elasticity of poverty for the 2004-08 period, poverty incidence would be 41 percent in 2012;
therefore, the 2015, MDG poverty target for Mauritania of 25 percent appears to be out of reach.
3

11.
There are important disparities between urban and rural areas, but overall
inequality is moderate. In rural areas, where 78 percent of the poor reside, the poverty rate
remained deeply entrenched at 59 percent between 2004 and 2008. In urban areas, by contrast,
poverty declined from 28.9 percent to 20.8 percent. In absolute terms, the number of poor
remained constant at 1.3 million because of population growth. Poverty incidence varies
significantly across regions. It is lowest in the main towns of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou (1619 percent) and the surrounding regions (32-37 percent). Poverty is highest (above 60 percent) in
two of the regions bordering the Senegal River, Gorgol and Brakna, which together account for
30 percent of the poor. The districts affected by the most extreme poverty are Monguel (71
percent), Moudjéria (65 percent), M’bagne (61 percent), Barkjéwol (60 percent) and M’bout (60
percent) 6. However, inequality is only moderate; the Gini coefficient was estimated at 0.38 in
2008, essentially the same as in 2004 (0.39). The bottom 20 percent enjoyed significant increases
in consumption – higher than increases for the non-poor – between 2000 and 2004, suggesting an
inclusive pattern of growth. However, this pattern was reversed in the 2004-08 period, as growth
was driven more by extractive industries. The creation by the government in March, 2013, of a
special agency (National Agency Tadamoun) to fight poverty and the legacy of slavery which
will consolidate previously scattered social protection programs in various government agencies
is a good start for better targeting the most vulnerable and the living conditions of the Haratines 7.
12.
The main constraints to poverty reduction are weakness of the rural economy,
dependence on capital-intensive sectors such as mining and industrial fishing, and
vulnerability to both environmental and economic shocks, which put the poor at even greater
risk of food insecurity and malnutrition. It is known that drivers of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity largely rely on economic diversification, social protection and employment
generation; however, growth poles in Mauritania are typically concentrated in sectors with
negligible diversification, limited job creation, and which are mostly poorly organized and
marked by high seasonality, such as the mining cluster, fishery and constructions. In 2007, rising
oil and food prices directly affected the food security of about 30 percent of the population; and
in 2011, the drought caused significant losses of cattle, with severe wealth and income loss for
farmers. In December 2011, an estimated one quarter of rural households were food insecure,
and half of these, severely so. In summary, for the poor and destitute, the stakes are high: any
environmental or economic shock could have an immediate and direct impact on their food
situation. As of end-2012, food insecurity – as a share of population – appears to be worst in the
northern regions of Mauritania (Figure 1). Due to the higher population density in the southern
and eastern regions, however, the number of people concerned is significantly larger in those
areas. Multiple factors underpin the worsening of food insecurity in the North, the main one
being a severe vulnerability of agricultural and pastoral activities to rainfall deficits. Inadequate
humanitarian response in these remote areas, which are hard to reach by development partners,
coupled with the effects of higher food prices, contribute to this scenario. 8

13.
The data that inform the Government’s recent food security strategy (2011-12) and
poverty reduction strategy (PRSP III, 2011) show that 26 percent of the population is
affected by food insecurity. This situation is related to the overall level of poverty; lack of
investment in the social and productive sectors, in particular agriculture; and the harsh climate.
Food insecurity was recently further aggravated by the recent rise in the price of food staples and
by the 2011 drought. Food insecurity is now affecting cities, but it remains most significant in
rural areas, and can affect any region of the country in a given year. The most vulnerable groups
are women and children, 25 percent of whom are less than 5 years old. In 2012, the Government
prepared an emergency program (called EMEL) of about US$157 million to mitigate the effects
of the drought. This program, financed by donors (including the Bank) and the government
budget, included three main components: (a) preventing human food insecurity through free food
distribution and access to subsidized food from boutiques de solidarité; (b) providing health care
for vulnerable groups and children; and (c) preserving livestock through imported feed supply,
animal health measures, and access to water points.
14.
The need for such emergency measures will likely increase, because the country’s
safety nets are unable to protect the poor and neediest. Existing safety net and nutrition
programs (about 0.2 percent of GDP) are small, fragmented, and poorly targeted; and do not
have the flexibility to address chronic food insecurity, respond to shocks, or be scaled up during
a crisis. Weak capacity to adapt safety net programs to changing population needs, and the
country’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, limit the effectiveness of these programs.
Moreover, their focus on short-term emergency relief does not contribute to poverty reduction.
15.
It will be difficult for Mauritania to achieve the MDG poverty target without
concerted effort on the key drivers of poverty reduction. However, if Mauritania can
maintain currently projected per capita income growth rates of 3.5 percent per annum, it could
cut extreme poverty in half 9 by 2030. This will require a more inclusive growth model, and a
strong social safety net to protect the poor from the increasingly frequent climatic shocks. Given
the predominantly rural nature of poverty, agricultural productivity improvement will be a
cornerstone of any poverty reduction strategy. However, ultimately many people will have to
move to urban areas, so private sector development and job creation will also be key. Improved
social services delivery and access to basic infrastructure will be also essential to support the
rapid urbanization. A vital complement will be judicious use of natural resource rents in
education, social safety nets and infrastructure. The proposed CPS will play an important role in
this effort, notably through support to agriculture and fishing, creation of a targeted safety net
system, and the decentralization of service delivery. Capacity-building on statistics, including
support for the next household poverty survey and the poverty assessment study will improve
understanding of the causes, characteristics, and spatial distribution of poverty.

9

According to the latest household survey (2008) and to recent World Bank staff (2012), extreme poverty in
Mauritania to date would be 41 percent.

Recent Economic Developments

Economic growth
16.
Mauritania’s growth recovered rapidly following the 2008-9 food and financial
crisis in spite of a number of exogenous

been construction, services, and agriculture
(which rebounded in 2010 and 2012) – all supported indirectly by mining exports, which
stagnated in volume terms but boomed in value terms due to rising prices for iron ore and gold.
Thus the total value of exports doubled between 2009 and 2011. This contributed to a significant
expansion in public revenues and spending, including major expansion plans by the state-owned
mining company, Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière (SNIM). At the same time,
substantial foreign direct investment has financed further expansion in mining, a power plant,
and a new airport.
Job creation
17.
Despite this growth, unemployment, broadly defined, affects an estimated 10
percent of the population and almost 17 percent in urban areas. 10 However, there is also
significant under-employment, as well as many who are no longer looking for work. One-third of
youth (15-34 years old) are inactive, neither working nor in school. Capital-intensive mining
projects are unable to absorb this rapidly growing and low-skilled population. The informal
economy and low value-added activities have contributed significantly to job creation in recent
years, and account for 85 percent of the total labor force. However, construction, transport, and
trade, while expected to absorb a portion of the unemployed workforce, remain poorly organized
and marked by high seasonality. The attractiveness of doing business in the country remains low,
especially with respect to taxes and access to credit. For both these indicators, Mauritania ranked
in the lowest decile in the 2013 Doing Business report, which analyses 185 economies.
Balance of payments
18.
The trade balance in 2011 registered a US$270 million surplus, driven by record
commodity prices. The value of exports increased by 52 percent in 2010 and 35 percent in 2011,
but no further increase was projected for 2012 as world mineral prices moderated. Three sectors
10

(minerals, fishing, and oil) account for virtually all exports, with iron ore alone representing half
of the total. China accounts for about 50 percent of total export sales. Imports rose dramatically
due to the expenses associated with the EMEL emergency program and major mining, energy,
and construction projects. As a result, the trade balance turned negative in 2012 and the current
account deficit was projected to soar to 31.6 percent of GDP. However, foreign investment was
also booming, and was estimated at roughly US$1.4 billion in 2012, equivalent to 34 percent of
GDP. Consequently, international reserves reached a record level of 6.2 months of imports as of
end 2012 and are expected to reach 7.4 months in 2013.
Fiscal developments
19.
The overall fiscal deficit has improved significantly; from 7 percent of GDP in 2008
to 1.5 percent in 2011 (see Box 2). This trend continued in 2012, with an estimated surplus of
2.8 percent. Expenditures rose by 6 percent of GDP due to emergency spending to address the
impact of the food crisis, and to increased investments in the energy and infrastructure sectors.
However, this was more than offset by a large increase in grants and revenues, from 26 percent
of GDP in 2011 to 38 percent in 2012, due to the food emergency, the booming mining sector,
and improvements in tax receipts. The fiscal deficit does not include a small oil fund, which
remained at 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012 after a partial drawdown to help finance the emergency
program.
20.
Rising subsidies and transfers, and a high wage bill, remain a challenge. The
government subsidizes gas, electricity, and petroleum, which altogether represent approximately
2.6 percent of GDP (2012). A significant share of this consists of arrears payments to fuel
retailers, as electricity and gas subsidies were reduced (in nominal terms) by roughly 50 percent,
and subsidies on petroleum products by more than 60 percent, between 2011 and 2012. The
authorities hope to raise domestic energy prices to international levels in 2013, providing there is
no further rise in international prices. Transfers to the 123 state agencies and state-owned
enterprises have also risen, mainly as a result of the lack of effective control over their
performance. Progress has been made on the wage bill, which was among the highest in SubSaharan Africa at 10 percent of GDP, but dropped to 8 percent in 2012. However, these savings
will be partly reversed by the wage increases in the 2013 budget.
Debt management
21.
According to a recent World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis, Mauritania is
at moderate risk of debt distress. As of end-2011, Mauritania’s total public debt stood at 84
percent of GDP. Only 9 percent of this was domestic debt. The country has not accessed the
international bond market to date, and 85 percent of its external debt is owed to multilateral and
bilateral creditors. The composition of debt has been relatively stable over time, shifting slightly
toward multilateral donors. A loan with the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), which was not
included in HIPC debt relief in 2002 (as it was considered passive at the time), has increased
from around US$40 million in the 1980s to US$1 billion in 2013 due to compounded interest on
arrears, and now represents 40 percent of total external debt stock. Negotiations have dragged on
for years, but the Mauritanian authorities expect a resolution in the near future, likely with a 8090 percent cancellation of the stock (including arrears) and a concessional rescheduling of the
remainder. This would significantly improve the country’s debt dynamics but not change the
level of risk of debt distress.

Economic Prospects

22.
In the PRSP-3, the Government stated its macroeconomic objectives for the 2011-15
period as: (a) average annual real GDP growth of 5.8 percent for the entire period; (b) average
inflation below 5 percent for the period; (c) budget deficit below 2.6 percent of non-oil GDP by
2015; and (d) international reserves close to 4 months of imports by 2015. All but the first have
already been achieved and should be sustainable. Achievement of the first objective is also
feasible, given current plans for expansion in the mining sector, as long as authorities continue to
put in place prudent fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies while pressing ahead with the
structural reform agenda.

merged with, the existing oil fund, to help manage volatile revenue flows. Capital expenditures
will remain stable in the medium term, at about 9-10 percent of GDP. A large portion of public
investment over the medium term is expected to focus on energy and transport (see Figure 3).
Current expenditures are expected to return to more normal levels in 2013 and then fall by 5
percent of GDP by 2017, as subsidies are phased out and the wage bill is controlled. State-owned
enterprises and agencies have contingent liabilities, but efforts are under way to strengthen
controls. The rationalization of the public sector may, however, prove challenging, given current
political and social tensions.
Box 3: New Bank Sahel Initiative

The Sahel sub-region (Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Chad) faces grave threats to its security
and development, exacerbated by the current crisis in Mali, but rooted in decades-long, regional economic,
political, demographic and ecological stresses. The country-focused development lens of the World Bank Group
and international partners has in many ways failed to identify and respond fully to these inter-linked, regional
drivers of fragility and instability. A new, regional approach to development is needed to prevent insecurity and
economic stresses in Mali from spilling over the Sahel in the short term and to ensure the region avoids a fragility
trap in the longer term.
Instability in the Sahel derives from a complex web of factors. Land pressures from rapid population growth,
combined with deteriorating and ever more extreme climate conditions—droughts, desertification and flash floods—
have induced significant migration and adoption of alternative survival means such as smuggling, trafficking or
joining radical groups. Weak institutions and lack of state presence in remote regions has undermined the formation
of national identity and hence the legitimacy of central governments. The return of hundreds of thousands of
immigrants as well as militants to their countries of origin in the Sahel following the Libyan crisis has further
aggravated prevailing food insecurity and malnutrition problems, cut the flow of remittances and contributed to the
radicalization of previously non-violent liberation movements in Mali.
The Sahel region is at risk of falling into a ‘fragility trap’—with the region and its economies caught in a low
growth, high poverty and insecurity equilibrium. Individual countries in the region—or at least large segments of
them—would find it difficult to exit this vicious circle as the stresses and conflict in neighboring countries continue
to spill over and buffet their economies. Addressing a region-wide fragility trap will require a coordinated, regional
response.
Key aims of the proposed regional approach are: First, substantially expand irrigation coverage by developing
the potential of the Niger and Senegal River Basins. Second, expand access and lower the cost of energy. Third,
support the resilience and productivity of pastoralism across the region. Fourth, strengthen safety nets and early
warning systems. Fifth, improve natural resource management to support sustainable and climate resilient
development. Sixth, reduce barriers to regional trade and integrate markets across the region, including improving
transport links and creating a fully integrated ICT network. Seventh, eliminate the seven Neglected Tropical
Diseases, which are a major cause of vulnerability throughout the Sahel. Eighth, adopt gender as a cross-cutting
theme. Ninth, work in partnership, especially with regional institutions and programs, and support their capacity
building. Mauritania will benefit from this Initiative, including through the Regional Pastoral Livelihoods
Program for the Sahel, the Regional Safety Nets Support Program for the Sahel, Banda Regional Gas to Power PRG
and Senegal River Basin Water Resources Development Program Phase II.

24.
Macroeconomic prospects remain vulnerable to external shocks, such as commodity
price volatility, drought and political instability in the Sahel. The current robust position is
largely due to recent exceptional world prices for iron ore. Current fiscal projections assume a
modest fall in this price, but a major drop could have negative impacts. The last drought in 2011
led to rising poverty and to a direct fiscal response equivalent to more than 2 percent of GDP, not
9

including the indirect impact through slower growth. Another source of vulnerability is related to
the current instability in the sub-region. This has led to higher expenses for security and the care
of refugees. These risks have been somewhat mitigated in the past through the oil fund, which
helped finance the response to the 2011 drought. Current proposals to create a mining fund
would help smooth out fluctuations in mineral prices. Agriculture programs, including irrigation,
supported under this CPS, will mitigate some of the risks related to droughts. Political instability
will be addressed through close collaboration with regional and international bodies, including
the new Bank-led Sahel initiative (see box 3).

1.5.

Major Development Challenges

25.
Mauritania faces three major and interrelated development challenges: (a) inclusive
growth; (b) competitiveness; and (c) governance.
Inclusive growth
26.
The lack of consistently inclusive growth has two main features: First, the country’s
current growth drivers – the extractive sectors – primarily benefit the public sector while
producing little private sector employment. Government revenues from the mining sector have a
high likelihood of growing because of (a) the projected 100 percent increase in volume over the
next five years; and (b) termination of the Kinross and Mauritanian Copper Mines (MCM) tax
holidays. While gold prices have fallen some 15 percent in the first quarter of 2013, the resulting
loss of revenues will be more than offset by the end of tax holidays, so overall revenue is
expected to remain high. Prices for gold as well as iron ore and copper are expected to trend
downwards over the coming years, but there are no indications that a negative price effect will
outweigh the growth in output. Second, the agriculture sector accounts for a large share of the
workforce, but has low productivity and is vulnerable to climate shocks, which has led to an
increase in food insecurity in rural areas, and to the expansion of urban slums populated with
unemployable rural migrants.
27.
The extractive industries are creating significant revenues; however, with few
linkages to other sectors, they have had little effect on private sector job creation (see Box
4). As a result, youth unemployment is high, creating the potential for social unrest. To address
this challenge, Mauritania will need to evolve from a rentier economy dependent on raw material
exports, to an economy that creates jobs through activities that add value to natural resources,
provide greater linkages to the rest of the economy, and give rise to new growth sectors. The
Government has taken some important steps in this direction by (a) providing targeted support to
skills development (e.g., the newly established School of Mines, and modernization of vocational
training programs in line with the needs of investors); and (b) making plans to use gas resources
to improve domestic electricity supply. Creating the foundation for broader growth, however,
will also require that mineral rents be used to diversify the economy and develop cheaper and
more reliable electricity, better roads, and modern communication systems, for the benefit of
commercial agriculture and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as investors. This
CPS, through its pillar 1, will help improve competitiveness and foster inclusive growth.

10

Box 4: Mining in Mauritania – A Growth Anchor
Mauritania has a long tradition of mining. The national iron ore mining company, SNIM, was established in 1952,
before independence, to construct and operate facilities to mine the large iron ore deposits identified in the northern
part of the country. The first shipment of iron ore took place in 1963. Since that time, SNIM has evolved into a
conglomerate with stakes in tourism, transport, and construction, although mining remains the dominant part of the
company’s operations.
In 2006, important gold and copper mining operations were launched by well-established international mining
companies. Since then, production volumes have gradually increased for all three commodities. Moreover, the
“commodity super-cycle” of rapidly increasing prices has greatly benefited the Mauritanian mining sector. In dollar
terms, the combined annual export value of these commodities has gone from approximately US$300 million in
2005 to US$1 billion in 2008 and more than US$2 billion in 2011. The production volume is expected to double
within the next five years, as various development plans, which are either under construction or at advanced stages
of design, come on line. The total investment costs for these developments are on the order of US$5-10 billion.
The mining operations have had significant and visible impacts on surrounding areas. Mine developers have
invested heavily in infrastructure facilities (roads, water, electricity) that supply mine sites, as well as in health
clinics, schools, and other local needs. Nevertheless, these operations have had little local economic impact in terms
of either direct employment or the emergence of local subcontractors. In response, the Government, in collaboration
with the mining companies and through Bank co-financing, has established a School of Mines which admitted its
first class of 24 students in 2011. At the time of their academic graduation in 2016, they will be joined by about 100
students who will, by then, have completed their three-year technical education in mine-related subjects. It is
expected that the annual batch of graduates from both academic and technical programs will double in size before
2020. These graduates are expected to be the foundation of mining-related industries.

28.
Inclusive growth will also require targeted support for agriculture and fisheries.
Mauritania’s rich marine fish resources contribute roughly 6 percent to GDP, and provide more
than one fourth of the country’s public revenues and roughly one third of export revenues.
However, the level of local employment in fishing is relatively low, and some 95 percent of the
fish caught in the country’s waters are taken by foreign fleets, only a share of which are landed
or processed in the country. The new EU fishing agreement would probably improve this.
29.
A much more serious problem is weak agricultural productivity, which is the main cause
of rural poverty. Almost all rural communities in Mauritania are food insecure, as are a large
proportion of poor people in peri-urban areas. This low productivity sector provides the main
source of income for a large share of the poor population. 11 The sector’s contribution to GDP is
limited by harsh climatic conditions, low and unreliable rainfall, poor agricultural water
management systems, and a very low level of irrigation development compared to potential. 12
30.
Despite limited arable land (0.5 percent of total land area), the sector has the
potential to guarantee the country a reasonable level of food security and reduce poverty in
rural areas (see Box 5). The potential for irrigated agriculture (140,000 ha) alone could satisfy all
the country’s needs for rice and a significant part of its needs for vegetables and other crops. The
sector already meets 30 percent of country’s requirements for cereal and milk production, and
100 percent of its requirements for red meat production. About 75,000 tons of meat (live animal)
exports per year account for 70 percent of agricultural GDP. An important focus of this CPS is
11

Estimates range from 50 percent in the last census (2000) to 23 percent in the 2008 household budget survey.
Agriculture is underperforming and declining in importance relative to mining and other sectors. The share of
agriculture (including livestock) in GDP fell from 37.4 percent in 1995 to 12.5 percent in 2007, with an average of
16.7 percent (3.7 percent crops and 13 percent livestock) during the 1991-2008 period.

11

improving agriculture and fishery productivity which are seen as key drivers of poverty
reduction.
31.
An important consequence of agriculture sector weaknesses is rapid urbanization,
which has made Mauritania one of the most urbanized countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (40
percent in 2011). This economic and demographic transformation has helped reduce rural
poverty, but has increased urban poverty and led to new challenges for urban service delivery.
More than 50 percent of the urban population now lives in informal settlements, and less than 27
percent is connected to electricity, 48 percent to water, and only one percent to sanitation
networks. These problems are compounded by lack of capacity at the local government level
(due to low revenues, insufficient and unqualified staff), posing key challenges for city planning,
economic integration, and the provision of basic services and key infrastructure. While rural
areas do not face similar population pressures, dispersed rural settlement patterns have resulted
in extremely low standards of rural service delivery, including transport and electricity, leaving
the rural poor disconnected from the growing economy.
Box 5: Agriculture for Food Security and Employment
Food imports are equivalent to ten percent of GDP in Mauritania. The Government and the Bank signed a US$10m
grant in September 2012 to mitigate the impacts of the 2011-2012 drought, combining IDA and GFRP resources. In
2012, with the assistance of the Bank, the country prepared a new Rural Development Strategy (horizon 2025),
together with a new legal framework for agriculture (LOA-loi d’Orientation Agropastorale) which is about to be
ratified in 2013. Simultaneously, the CAADP process in Mauritania led to the adoption of the country national
agricultural and food security investment plan (PNIA/SA).
Within this context, a priority agricultural investment program (called Programme de Développement Rural Intégré
- Integrated Rural Development Program, PDRI 2014-2019) was set at the end of 2012 for the forthcoming five-year
period. The Program consists of six sub-programs within which priority investments totaling US$417 million have
been identified. With strong private sector involvement, the Government expects this program will contribute to a
gradual increase of agricultural production leading to at least 234,570 metric tons of grain. Irrigations schemes are
expected to provide 170,000 T of cereals. About 19,200 tons of milk (26 percent of current milk import in 2011) are
expected to be produced by 2018. The PDRI is expected to benefit around 73,500 farm households and to boost
employment in rural areas.
The Government has asked the Bank to help organize donors’ support through a limited number of large projects
including pool funding and/or parallel financing. Following the principles of the Paris Declaration on aid
effectiveness for donor coordination, alignment and harmonization, the Bank is currently in the preparation process
of preparing an agriculture sector support project. It is using limited IDA resources to leverage funds from a number
of other financial and technical partners (Islamic Development Bank, AFD, the EU, GEF) in order to contribute to
solve key issues like poor sector governance and coordination, mismanagement of productive investments, lack of
capacity of regulatory, advisory and productive services, low competitiveness of key value chains, etc. Some
encouraging early results have been achieved.
In addition, the Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) assisted the Government in the preparation
of a new GAFSP proposal in June 2013. It is expected that this will lead to transformational investment operations
within the PDRI framework program, as early as FY14. New operations are designed to avoid overlaps and ensure
complementarity with two other Bank supported regional operations currently under preparation for IDA financing
(i.e. the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program for Mauritania – WAAPP/MR which will be done through
CILS and the Integrated Water Resources Management Program - PGIRE/OMVS-phase 2).

32.
Following successful slum rehabilitation in Nouakchott, financed by the Bank, the
Government launched a broad slum restructuring program in Nouakchott and around the
12

country. The program is progressing well, but the level of access to basic infrastructure and
services is still insufficient in the rehabilitated and newly built areas. The large proportion of
youth among the slum population (60 percent are under 25), and the high youth unemployment
rate in the slums (60 percent for youth between 15 and 24), have become pressing challenges in
recent years. Addressing these challenges will require targeted efforts to strengthen local
governments, through: (a) short and medium-term policies to reinforce local governments,
including significant fiscal transfers and efficient capacity building; (b) policies to improve
access to basic services and infrastructure in cities; (c) access to decent housing for low and
below-average income earners; (d) investment climate reforms and economic diversification; and
(e) improved education and skills, particularly for slum-dwelling youth (see Box 6). The recently
approved local government development program will be a critical part of government’s strategy
of improving service delivery to its population.
Box 6: Local Government Development Program
Mauritania Local Governments Development Project (LGDP) is an integrated, multi-sectoral project that aims to
strengthen the capacity of local governments (LGs) to reduce poverty and strengthen inclusion. In addition to
capacity building, the project provides significant resources to finance local investment priorities.
Improving access to basic infrastructure and services: Investment priorities are identified in a participatory
manner and correspond to the real needs of local populations. They cover the entire field of competence of LGs,
including, among others, education and skills development, health, transport, water, sanitation, solid waste
management, power, youth, and sports.
Targeting poverty and areas with specific stress: The LGs to be covered by the program have been chosen with
great care to ensure both a wide geographic coverage and good poverty targeting. Apart from the LGs of regional
capitals, which have already benefited from the Urban Development Program (UDP), all LGs of department capitals
will be covered, which provides coverage of almost the entire country. In addition, rural LGs in the area known as
the "triangle of poverty," and all rural municipalities bordering Mali, will be covered by the project.
Search for greater inclusiveness: Funds will be allocated on an annual basis. The amount allocated to each LG will
depend on its performance in a number of pre-defined areas, as assessed annually by an independent auditor. The
project places great emphasis on the participation and involvement of the population, especially vulnerable groups,
in local-level decision making. The LGs, for their part, see the project as helping to develop and encourage social
responsibility.
Ensured sustainability and an open door for aid harmonization: The project is supporting the National
Integrated Program, largely funded by the Government, which wants it to become a permanent support program for
LGs. The main component of the program, the performance-based grant, which allocates funding for investment
priorities, is designed as a basket fund to which all interested partners can contribute. In addition to the Government
and the Bank, the European Union has already confirmed its participation in this program, and other partners are
expected to join.

Lack of competitiveness
33.
Mauritania’s competitiveness is hampered by a small formal economic base,
declining manufacturing sector, limited diversification, and a weak legal environment
(figures 4-6). By the mid-2000s, fewer than 250 formal firms with more than 5 employees were
active in manufacturing/handicrafts and retail trade (World Bank 2007). Manufacturing and
handicrafts accounted for 3.7 of GDP in 2011 (against about 8.5 percent in the mid-1990s), and
were concentrated in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. The narrow manufacturing base has further
reinforced the dominance of large business groups, which have crowded out most SMEs.
13

Monopolies also dominate bank credit at the expense of SMEs. In effect, most local banks
behave as if they were departments of commercial and industrial groups, and deal mainly with
the members of those groups; customers that do not belong to a group have difficulty obtaining
financial services. Large firms with political connections continue to dominate state procurement
contracts and import markets, even in the presence of cheaper local producers. These
monopolies, whether public or private, are indifferent to inflation and the exchange rate because
they can pass costs on to their captive markets. At the same time, the environment remains
difficult for SMEs and investors in non-monopoly sectors because of serious deficiencies in
terms of taxation, access to credit, starting a business, resolving insolvency, and trading across
borders. Mauritania is ranked 167th out of 185 countries in terms of business environment. A
key feature of this WBG CPS, supported by IDA, IFC and MIGA, will be to improve the
competitiveness of the economy, hence fostering the creation of jobs by small medium
enterprises, a key driver for poverty reduction and sharing prosperity among the population of
Mauritania.

Access to finance is the top constraint for the Mauritanian private sector (Figure 7).
Mauritania stands at 167th in the ranking of 185 economies on the ease of getting credit, which is
below the regional average for Sub-Saharan Africa and for comparable economies such as Mali
and The Gambia. One of the main reasons for limited access to financial services, especially for
SMEs, is the lack of financial statements, itself a result of a weak accounting profession. The
credit information system and collateral and bankruptcy laws also do not facilitate access to
credit.

35.
A shortage of skilled workers is also a key constraint. Inadequate education of the
workforce is the third most important constraint to firms in Mauritania (WEF 2012). Many
workers have limited or no education and very few firms provide formal training for their
employees. With World Bank support, progress has been made in increasing the access to and
relevance of technical and training programs, using competency-based approaches and on-thejob training. In addition, seven training institutions have signed performance contracts with the
Government.
36.
Weak human resource capacity is a pervasive and cross-cutting issue that affects not
only large and small private enterprises, but also public administration and civil society.
Progress has been achieved in recent years through improvements in education, and further
progress is expected with the strengthening of the higher education and technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) systems. Much remains to be done, however. Training in the
public sector is still sporadic and does not provide the skills needed to modernize the
administration and support accelerated growth. Furthermore, a succession of changes in key
ministries (including the Ministry of Finance), which continued until early 2011, led to the loss
of many high-level civil servants and consequently, of institutional memory, which hurt reform
efforts. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity was also lost in many areas, and the
capabilities of the National Statistical Office (ONS) declined sharply. Human capacity
weaknesses also amplify Mauritania’s governance challenges.
15

Poor governance
37.
Corruption remains important and has broad economic and social impacts. Governance is
also a challenge in key sectors such as land management and natural resources management.
These challenges, compounded by public administration capacity limitations, are also affecting
state effectiveness in delivering services, implementing public policies, and ensuring adequate
corporate governance of SOEs, whose role in the economy has been growing over the last five
years. A major focus of his CPS, through its pillar 2, will be on improving economic governance
and service delivery, through support to improved services in education, health and social
protection sectors.
38.
Despite its impressive 20-point rise in Transparency International’s Corruption
Perception Index, Mauritania still ranks 123rd out of 176 countries and territories in level of
corruption. For firms, corruption generates instability in the business environment and increases
operating costs, which further undermines the country’s competitiveness. In the mid-2000s, an
estimated 6.4 percent of manufacturing turnover was devoted to informal payments (World Bank
2007). The Government has taken concrete steps to strengthen transparency and accountability
and combat corruption, including adoption of a National Anti-Corruption Strategy, formulated
with UNDP support, and a Code of Ethics for civil servants. Several cases of corruption have
been prosecuted.
39.
Social cohesion and resilience in both urban and rural areas are also affected by
poor land governance. In urban areas, land speculation and illegal land occupation have created
social divisions, marginalization, and a growing sense of injustice. In rural areas, land
distribution and management have serious implications for stability and development. Property
rights are a serious source of conflict for smallholders and for returnees, who often are allocated
land with limited agricultural value. The potential for conflict is magnified by the lack of access
to formal justice and redress mechanisms. Land issues are of particular significance in
Mauritania because of its historically high number of migrating populations. Further, there are no
land-use management plans that would allow for the rational, balanced, and equitable
development needed to reduce regional inequalities.
40.
Governance is also critical to strengthening social resilience to shocks, in particular
through improving service delivery. Critical areas for service delivery include the MDG areas
of maternal health, child mortality, and hunger alleviation. There have been slight improvements
in access to health services, but the quality of health services, especially for the poor, have yet to
improve. Utilization of public health facilities, especially in the poorest areas, has not increased
despite the support of the World Bank and other donors. MDG targets for maternal health, child
mortality, and hunger alleviation are off track. Access to electricity also remains limited, with an
estimated 60 percent of the population still using solid fuels. Overall, the Government recognizes
that general subsidies on energy products mostly benefit the rich, while the poorest households
allocate less than two percent of their total spending to energy products. There is poor
coordination and little monitoring of the safety net programs, and their effectiveness is
diminished by significant leakages to the non-poor.
41.
Natural resources management is also facing important governance challenges
despite progress in terms of transparency. Mauritania qualified as a compliant country under
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in 2012, and since that time, Government
16

revenues from the sector have been regularly published. However, other parts of the extractive
industry value chain, including license allocation and the investment of natural resource
revenues, are considerably less transparent, as noted in the country 2012 EITI report. In addition,
despite the introduction of a rules-based and digitized licensing system for mining and
hydrocarbon rights, there is strong political interest in retaining close control of the licensing
process. Capacity building in license management and monitoring of investor performance has
already contributed to improvements, but further strengthening is required. It is expected that
new EITI requirements concerning license disclosure will strengthen governance in this area.
42.
In 2007, some failed privatizations and private ventures 13 led the Government to
create a number of SOEs to provide services and employment. 14 However, this expansion of
the state’s role in the economy was not accompanied by sufficient strengthening of the SOE
governance framework, which allowed for ineffective financial management, making it
necessary to increase subsidies and transfers, and negatively impacting the fiscal situation.
Further, the lack of performance monitoring and evaluation has led to entrenched managerial
weaknesses and poor service delivery, which hurts social resilience and increases the potential
for social unrest. Improving the governance and oversight of these SOEs is critical, and the
rationale for their creation needs to be reviewed. There is also insufficient governance of the
financial management and human resources systems of public agencies, which limits the
agencies’ effectiveness and presents a fiscal risk.
43.
All of these governance challenges are compounded by public administration
limitations. It is clear that revenue collection has increased, Treasury management has been
strengthened, automatic expenditure chains have been introduced, and sector-level medium-term
expenditure frameworks (MTEF) are being developed. However, the financial situations of SOEs
and public agencies, and lack of effective oversight, represent a substantial fiscal risk. Further,
the recently initiated public procurement reform appears to be highly complex, and human
resources management still represents a significant challenge. The human resource management
system is poorly integrated, and the wage bill is significant by regional and international
standards, representing around 7 percent of GDP, or 72 percent of domestic revenue. 15
Statistical capacity also remains limited, constraining the Government’s ability to use data as a
basis for decision-making.

1.6.

Government Priorities and Poverty Reduction Strategy 2011-2015

44.
Following the general vision for 2015 articulated in the Poverty Reduction
Framework Law of 2001, the Government has adopted its third PRSP for 2011-2015.
PRSP-3 follows and builds on PRSP-1 and PRSP-2. The PRSP-3 provides a comprehensive
framework for implementing an ambitious growth and poverty reduction agenda over 20112015. It has the same five principal objectives as PRSP-2 and is articulated around the same five
pillars: (a) accelerating economic growth and maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) making
growth more inclusive by developing the growth potential and productivity of the poor; (c)
13

The failed privatization of the power utility SOMELEC and recent bankruptcy of the privately owned domestic
airline.
14
This includes the creation of SOEs handling public transport and housing, a public bank, a national airline and the
planned expansion of energy production that is not backed by the private sector.
15
The wage bill is among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, it is above the recommended target rate
of 35 percent of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

17

improving the potential of the Mauritanian people and expanding their access to basic social
services; (d) enhancing governance and institutional development; and (e) improving planning
and M&E systems. The PRSP-3 was prepared through a wide participatory process with the
private sector and civil society. Moreover, in 2012, the Government, with technical support from
UNICEF, prepared a comprehensive National Social Protection Strategy to complement the
PRSP-3, and this strategy is expected to be adopted before the end of 2013. Together, these
strategies provide a solid basis for donor coordination and resource mobilization. While the
PRSP-3 is quite comprehensive, the pillars do not clearly prioritize the proposed actions. The
pillars are summarized below.
Pillar I: Accelerating Growth and Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
45.
PRSP-3 is built on a macroeconomic framework that aims to unlock Mauritania’s
growth potential while safeguarding stability. The strategy recommends three key sets of actions:
•

The first set of actions are focused on stimulating the private sector, including SMEs and
agriculture; improving the business environment and investment incentives; modernizing
the financial sector; liberalizing the business and services sector; and improving the
competition framework in order to stem non-competitive practices.

•

The second set of actions aim at developing and expanding growth-supporting
infrastructure, including transport, electric power production, and ICT. 16

•

The third set of actions aim at making more productive use of the country’s sources of
growth – mining and hydrocarbons, fisheries, tourism, and manufacturing, as well as
agriculture and rural development. Actions in the area of rural development include
policies and investments to modernize the sector and support the development of rain-fed
agriculture, irrigation, and livestock raising, with the aim of increasing productivity and
reducing dependency on food imports (particularly cereals).
Pillar II: Making Growth More Inclusive

46.
Extending growth to the poor is a critical challenge, since growth is typically not
driven by the labor-intensive sectors that employ most of the poor, in particular agriculture
and fishery. In recognition of this fact, the PRSP-3 aims at a rural sector contribution to growth
of 0.7 percent of GDP – greater than the 0.6 percent achieved under PRSP-2, but considerably
less than the 2 percent planned for industry and mining, and the 2.4 percent for services.
Acknowledging that improving the productivity of agriculture is key to poverty reduction, the
PRSP-3 aims under Pillar 1 to make the sector more modern and productive. Pillar 3 adds to
these efforts by also targeting (a) food security; (b) urban (including peri-urban) development;
(c) microfinance and microenterprise; (d) development of the economic potential of the
environment (particularly to benefit migrating populations); and (e) social protection. In support
of the latter, the recently adopted National Social Protection Strategy aims at putting in place a
medium term framework to protect the poor. This framework will improve the efficiency of
existing safety net programs, and introduce new programs (such as cash transfers) targeted to the
chronic poor and vulnerable, which could be scaled up as needed to respond to crises.

16

Penetration of telephony services reached 100 percent in 2011, matching the levels of Morocco and Algeria, with
some remaining challenges in terms of rural coverage, especially in the eastern part of the country. However,
broadband services have so far achieved only 2 percent penetration.

18

Pillar III: Developing Human Capital and Enhancing Access to Basic Services
47.
PRSP-3 underscores the importance of investing in human capital as a key
development priority, and sets out a program covering six areas: (a) education and training; (b)
healthcare and nutrition; (c) employment promotion; (d) universal access to basic services,
including access to drinking water in rural areas; (e) gender equity and protection of children;
and (f) population policy. The comprehensive education agenda covers primary, secondary, and
higher education, as well as TVET and literacy. It focuses on improving the quality of education
at all levels; gearing curricula towards meeting market demands for advanced and technical jobs;
and closing educational disparities based on gender, socioeconomic characteristics, and region.
Pillar IV. Improving Governance and Capacity Building
48.
PRSP-3 prioritizes governance reforms in six separate areas. First, a set of political
and judicial reforms will strengthen democratic processes, human rights and national unity, and
redress the effects of slavery. A second set of governance reforms will aim at accelerating
institutional decentralization, modernizing local government, and promoting spatial planning and
regional development, including through growth poles. Third, in the area of public
administration, the Government will implement the comprehensive finance reform program, the
new public procurement framework, the new anti-corruption strategy, and the statistical
development strategy. Additional reforms will strengthen accountability and improve oversight
and management of state property and assets, in particular SOEs and public agencies. Fourth, an
environmental governance framework will be developed and climate change risks integrated into
development strategies and programs. Fifth, the development of civil society will be encouraged.
And sixth, an ambitious program will be carried out to improve public sector capacity in the
areas of administrative processes, human resources management, and information technology.
Pillar V. Improving Monitoring and Evaluation
49.
The M&E framework under PRSP-3 is stronger than it was under PRSP-2, and uses
fewer and more relevant indicators (74 indicators, including 19 MDG indicators). Monitoring
will be carried out by Sectoral Technical Committees, and coordinated by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and Development (MAED) and its dedicated PRSP monitoring unit. The
reporting system will include input reports (budget execution), quarterly technical committee
reports on monitoring actions taken, bi-annual summary reports by MAED, and comprehensive
annual progress reports. Bi-annual coordination meetings are planned between the Government
and financial and technical partners, and regular consultations will be held with the private sector
and civil society.
II. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

2.1.

Experience and Lessons Learned from Previous CAS and from
Stakeholder Feedback

The 2008-2011 CAS Completion Report
50.
The Bank’s objectives and planned activities in Mauritania over the past five years
were articulated in the 2008-2011 CAS presented to the Board on July 17, 2007. This was
the Bank’s third CAS for Mauritania. Results and lessons from that CAS are assessed in the
19

CAS-3 Completion Report (CASCR), attached as Annex 2. The CAS-3 was closely aligned with
PRSP-2 pillars I to IV. A major constraint in preparing that CAS was the limited new IDA
financing expected to be available – only US$43 million for the whole period. However, the
CAS-3 anticipated that, with Mauritania’s GNI boosted by oil revenues, the country might be
transitioning from low-income to middle-income country (MIC) status, and therefore suggested
introducing IBRD instruments (loans and guarantees) as alternative sources of financing to
support private enclave projects (ports and power plants). The CAS-3 priority areas were: (a)
private sector and basic infrastructure development; (b) urban development; (c) rural
development; (d) governance (strengthening of public administration and economic governance);
and (e) the social sectors. 17 Priority areas were targeted through ongoing operations approved
during CAS-2, as well as through new operations.
51.
CAS-3 implementation, as well as Mauritania’s economic performance, was
negatively affected by the political events of 2008-2010 and the resulting disruptions,
including the suspension of external aid (and World Bank activities) for more than a year.
Overall, the performance of the CAS program was assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. Bank
performance was also assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. A detailed assessment is included
as part of the CASCR in Annex 2.
52.
Important lessons learned include, first, that development impact can be achieved
with sustained engagement; and second, that the pervasive problem of Mauritania’s weak
capacity can be mitigated through the Bank’s long-term involvement with a program of
reforms with realistic objectives, combined with sustained capacity building efforts. A third
lesson is that development results – particularly transformational change – is not
necessarily linked to the amount of financing provided by the Bank. Rather, a key factor is
the Bank’s strong convening role, as other donors will engage in a sector along with the Bank, as
is currently happening in the agriculture sector. The Bank’s ability to leverage change is
strengthened by the widespread perception that it is an honest broker whose participation brings
unique global know-how. In the future, if Mauritania realizes the expected increase in natural
resource revenues and is able to finance a larger share of its development programs, the
Government will be increasingly interested in working with the Bank as a source of knowledge
and worldwide experience that other donors may not have.
53.
Despite progress achieved in public sector capacity building, more needs to be done
in areas such as SOE corporate governance. Tax administration has been strengthened, with a
fiscal census which increased the number of identified taxpayers and generated a significant
increase of tax collection in 2012. Expenditure management was also reinforced with the
successful introduction of an expenditure tracking system, the recent public procurement reform,
and the reconciliation between payroll and human resources data.
54.
At the end of the CAS-3 period, in December 2011 and January 2012, a country
survey was carried out to collect perceptions and advice on the Bank’s work in Mauritania.
The survey, which collected responses from 110 stakeholder representatives, revealed a clear
split in stakeholder perceptions: (a) stakeholder groups, which were more familiar with the Bank,
had a mostly positive view of its work and, (b) NGOs/CBOs which were unfamiliar with the
Bank, had very negative perceptions of its work in the country. Government effectiveness,
17

Despite the number of donors already active in the social sectors, the Bank played an important catalytic role, and
has a relatively strong comparative advantage.

20

governance, and education were top priorities for all stakeholders. Non-NGO groups were much
more concerned about economic growth, whereas NGO respondents voiced concern about
corruption. During the upcoming CPS, the Bank will reach out more to stakeholder groups that
are unfamiliar with the Bank’s work.
55.
Across all respondents, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Mauritania received a mean
rating of 4.7 on a 10-point scale, lower (driven significantly by NGOs) than the ratings in FY08
(5.3) and FY05 (6.8). The majority of all respondents indicated that the Bank should: (a) be more
involved in Mauritania’s development strategies; and (b) focus more attention and resources on
the regions outside of Nouakchott. Respondents also indicated that the Bank’s greatest weakness
in its work in Mauritania is the tendency to impose technocratic solutions without regard to
political realities.
Lessons Learned from the Political and Social Analysis
56.
A Political and Social Analysis (PSA) of the conflict and fragility risks, based on incountry interviews and seminars with opinion leaders, was carried out in early 2012. The
PSA concluded that: (a) the Bank faces a reputational risk from engaging in Mauritania, given
its social and political instability; (b) the Bank needs to address the issue of land tenure; (c) there
is a need to improve access to justice and formal conflict resolutions mechanisms; (d) youth
exclusion is a major issue, especially in urban areas; (e) urbanization and the ethnic-social divide
are leading to the creation of ghettos and a perpetual cycle of marginalization; (f) the Bank
should support and reinforce the Government’s communication with civil society, encourage
cultural dialogue, and promote transparency through better access to information; and (g) given
the high level a distrust towards the Government, it is essential to put a strong emphasis on
governance and anti-corruption (GAC) programs.
Gender Assessment
57.
As a follow up to the 2007 Strategic Country Gender Assessment, the Bank
conducted the 2012 Gender Portfolio Review 18. This report concluded that over the last
decade, Mauritania has been made significant progress in many gender-related areas, including
reducing gender disparities in primary education, improving access to clean water, reducing
adolescent fertility, reducing the prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM), and increasing
women’s voice in public decision making, including through the introduction of a quota for
women’s representation in parliament. However, key challenges remain, especially with regard
to achieving the MDG target to improve maternal health, gender inequalities in secondary
education; rural women’s low access to productive inputs and consequent low agricultural
productivity.
58.
The Bank’s 2012 Gender Portfolio Review for Mauritania found that 65 percent 19 of
all portfolio activities are gender informed (11 out of 17 active projects at the time of the
review, in the first semester of 2012). This means that 63 percent of the currently active IDA
portfolio, 100 percent of the pipeline IDA portfolio, 100 percent of trust-funded projects, and 25
18

The 2012 Gender Portfolio provides an overview of the current state of gender in Mauritania as well as an
assessment of the coverage of gender work in the World Bank portfolio.
19
This rate surpasses the IDA-16 target of 60 percent for gender-informed activities.

21

percent of economic and sector work (ESW) and technical assistance (TA) in Mauritania are
gender-informed on at least one of the following dimensions: analysis, actions, and M&E. At
the time of the review, the portfolio was supporting a range of gender-related outcomes,
including (a) expanding women’s access to basic social and economic infrastructure and
services; (b) increased agricultural productivity and food security for rural women; (c) improved
economic opportunities for women entrepreneurs; (d) job creation for women; (e) more effective
participation of women in community decision-making; and (f) increased capacity of women to
be aware of and engage with key issues in extractive industry governance. (See Box 7.)

improve productivity and improve food security. Further, the project addresses fundamental issue of women’s legal
rights and secures their access to land which in turn could allow the Bank to build on its current activities and ensure
that gains in female agricultural productivity and food security are sustainable and secure over the long-term.
Urban Development Project address women’s needs in term of basic social infrastructure and services in urban
areas. The project applies the issue of access to land with a component in land tenure-regularization, as most of the
beneficiaries in this area are female headed households.

59.
The proposed CPS aims to further increase the gender sensitivity of the portfolio,
with a focus on: (a) inclusion of appropriate gender-sensitive indicators in project results
frameworks; and (b) increasing the use of gender-relevant analysis in ESW and analytical and
advisory activities (AAA), in order to build the gender knowledge base and provide critical
inputs to current and further operations. In terms of substance, the CPS will emphasize the
following priorities, in line with the PRSP-3 and the Government’s gender strategy documents:
•
•
•
•

Increase women’s participation in the economy
Increase women’s access to basic social services and infrastructure
Promote gender equality in secondary education
Increase gender equity in the agriculture sector.

60.
During the CPS period, the gender focus will be on issues in agriculture, environment,
education, mining, and health, especially maternal mortality. The CPS will support a more
detailed mapping of women's poverty and role in the economy, looking in particular at
employment opportunities in the extractive industries, and at other economic activities under the
Bank’s current and planned operational portfolio. The social protection and sustainable
livelihood operations will also focus more on gender issues.

In addition to the lending program, the Bank is engaged in a range of analytical
work and technical assistance focused on accounting, land governance, and SOE governance.
This work includes:
•

Support to the General Directorate to implement recommendations of the Report on the
Observation of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for the private sector accounting and auditing
profession.

•

A land governance study in support of the Land Governance Assessment Framework
(LGAF). The study focuses on five key areas: rights recognition and enforcement; land use
planning, land management, and taxation; management of public land; public access to land
information; and dispute resolution and conflict management. The study is part of a process
aimed at establishing consensus about priority actions to address gaps in existing
information, areas for regulatory or institutional changes, and criteria to assess the
effectiveness of mitigating measures.

•

A study on SOEs and public agencies. Both a diagnostic of the current governance
framework, with a focus on state oversight and monitoring of fiscal risk and service delivery
performance; and a knowledge product that transfers international experience, the study is
expected to lead to a series of policy changes and measures to improve state oversight.

63.
MIGA’s activities in the past have focused on TA in the financial sector; it has not
yet issued coverage for any investments in Mauritania.

IFC’s advisory services have included a fee-for-service contract with the Government
to structure a public-private partnership (PPP) for development of a new container terminal in the
port of Nouakchott; and the promotion of leasing as an alternative source of financing under its
Africa Leasing Facility. IFC has also pursued projects in the mining, energy, non-bank financial
institution (NBFI), and agribusiness sectors. IFC’s investments in Mauritania during FY13
included US$13.8 million with two commercial banks under its Global Trade Finance Program
(GTFP); and a two-year, US$127.5 million trade facility for BB Energy to purchase and import
refined petroleum products to Mauritania. The facility will ensure no supply interruption in the
flow of energy products.

Looking Forward: Proposed World Bank Group Strategy for
FY2014-16

The design of the FY 2014-16 CPS is guided by the following principles:
Selectivity based on the comparative advantage of the Bank Group.
Complementarity with other donors, with preference given to new operations in which
the convening power of the Bank leverages financing from other donors for
transformative change.
Program and project design that takes into consideration the need to strengthen the
population’s resilience to shocks; gender equity issues; and the social fabric and political
economy of the country.

66.
The CPS will selectively focus on areas that are acknowledged as key constraints to
development, and where (a) there is a window of opportunity for growth and job creation; and
(b) the Government, private sector, or other donors seek to work in partnership with the WBG.
These selectivity criteria will help to focus the Bank’s engagement and build stronger teams for
results. The CPS will participate in area in which long-term Bank involvement is essential, and
where Mauritania itself will finance a larger share of its development programs out of expected
natural resource revenues. The Government is increasingly interested in the participation of the
Bank as source of knowledge, bringing worldwide experience that other donors may not have.
Leverage for change is particularly strong when the Bank is perceived as an honest broker and a
source of unique worldwide know-how.
Financial Envelope
67.
The proposed program design is currently based on the assumption of an IDA-16
allocation of SDR43.2 million, equivalent to US$65 million, followed by (anticipated,
approximate) IDA-17 annual allocations for FY15 and FY16 of US$20 million (assuming the
IDA-17 allocation will remain at the same level as the IDA-16 allocation). This would amount to
a total CPS envelope for new IDA lending of US$102 million, supplemented by additional IDA
allocations for regional projects, IBRD enclave loans, and trust fund resources. IDA allocations
for the years beyond FY14 are indicative. Actual allocations may vary depending on: (a) total
IDA resources available, (b) the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population;
(c) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with
MDRI annual debt service foregone; (d) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA
24

assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (e) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also,
IDA allocations are provided in SDR terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at
the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR (applicable for IDA16), the exchange rate for each
operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval. Additional resources
would be leveraged through other Donors (such as the Islamic Development Bank and the
French Development Agency in the agriculture sector, for example), trust funds (TF, including
the Global Agriculture Food Security Program - GAFSP), the Institutional Development Facility
(IDF), the Global Environment Fund (GEF), the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), and
Bank-executed trust funds for technical and analytical work.
68.
During implementation of the previous CAS, the team was successful in leveraging
some additional trust fund resources (equivalent to about one quarter of the currently
active IDA commitments). Under the proposed CPS, the team is also expected to leverage
resources from the Islamic Development Bank, AFD, the Global Agriculture Food Security
Program, (GAFSP), IDF, GEF, GPE, and Bank-executed trust funds for technical and analytical
work as well using the instruments to mitigate country risks for private sector financing such as
WB PRGs, and MIGA insurance instruments.

2.4.

Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending
Activities

69.
The Bank’s proposed CPS work program for FY 2014-16 is fully aligned with the
Government’s PRSP-3 pillars I-IV, and proposes to respond to Mauritania’s development
challenges by concentrating on two main pillars.
•
•

Pillar 1 – Growth and Diversification
Pillar 2 – Economic Governance and Service Delivery

Pillar 1 – Growth and Diversification
70.
Under Pillar 1 of the new CPS, the World Bank Group will support infrastructure
development, private sector development, and strengthening of the financial sector. In
supporting these main drivers of poverty reduction and improving shared prosperity, this CPS
will contribute towards inclusive growth and a more competitive economy. Additional activities
will identify ways to trigger shared prosperity linked to the thriving mining industry, and to help
unleash the potential of the agriculture and fisheries sectors. In particular outcomes 1A, 1B, 2,
3A and 4 will contribute to the goal of shared prosperity while outcomes 5, 6, 7 will contribute to
both poverty eradication and shared prosperity. Capacity building and institutional strengthening
will continue in the mining and oil sectors. Outcomes and associated operational and analytical
activities are as follows:
71.
Outcome 1.A: Improved financial services for micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs). Although large business groups dominate the market, MSMEs comprise the
largest share of firms in Mauritania, and a key constraint is their access to finance. Interventions
in this area will be carried out jointly by the IFC and the World Bank.
Analytical and Advisory Activities
25

-

TA on implementation of the financial sector strategy. Financial Sector Reform and
Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative funding in FY13 supported the development of a
financial sector development strategy. Technical assistance in this area would focus on
assisting the Government in finalizing its strategy and a roadmap for implementation.

Operational Activities
-

As indicated in para 34, access to finance is the main constraint for the Mauritanian
private sector. IFC will contribute to improve SMEs’ access to finance through TA to
support creation of a credit bureau. In addition to promoting trade via two commercial
banks under its Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), IFC has identified other financial
institutions to increase trade and SME financing. It is expected that one or more
commercial banks will be provided with IFC’s MSME advisory services to build their
SME lending capacity.

-

IFC expects to finance the expansion and diversification of a local dairy company, to
support the production of affordable protein sources and increased domestic food
production. The project will provide better livelihoods and incomes to up to 2,000
nomadic herders and more than 2,500 MSMEs.

72.
Outcome 1.B: Improved regulatory climate. The business environment in Mauritania
suffers from significant deficiencies, and the CPS will provide a structured program of analytical
work and lending to support its improvement. Under this CPS, the Bank will provide the
analytical and advisory services as well as lending.
Analytical and Advisory Activities
-

An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) will provide an up-to-date analysis of
investment climate issues based on results from a firm-level survey. In addition to the
usual analyses of constraints to growth and productivity, specific attention will be
devoted to sector competitiveness and firm taxation; access to finance; and gender-aware
employment generation.

-

An assessment of linkages and clusters in the extractive sector in Mauritania will be the
basis of a policy note on the mismatch between the procurement needs of extractive
companies in Mauritania and the capacity of local SMEs to meet those needs. This work
will contribute to identifying a roadmap of interventions and institutional reforms to
address these constraints.

-

TA to assist the Government in operationalizing the Nouadhibou Special Economic Zone
(SEZ) and other SEZs in the country.

Operational Activities
-

The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project: A Special Economic Zone
Approach (FY15) will improve firms’ competitiveness and support Government efforts to
create SEZs in the country. The Bank will support the SEZ of Nouadhibou.
26

-

The Business Environment Enhancement Project (BEEP) is an ongoing project aimed at
improving the financial, legal, and regulatory environment for business. The project will
receive additional financing in FY15.

-

Complementary to the BEEP investment climate reform project, IFC will focus on
simplifying the procedures for starting a business and paying taxes.

-

To ensure that economic recovery is inclusive and sustainable, IFC will also focus on
SME capacity building, and has started to roll out its Business Edge training programs in
Mauritania.

-

IFC and the Bank will continue engaging with the Government in develop PPPs in
infrastructure that are in the best interests of the country like the extension of the Gas to
Power initiative, roads and infrastructure for the SEZ of Nouadhibou. MIGA guarantees
can also be used to reassure private investors at an early stage in the PPP process, and can
be used to complement other WBG products to maximize the chances for PPP success.

-

MIGA will provide political risk insurance product lines, in the traditional covers of
Transfer Restriction, Expropriation and War and Civil Disturbance to encourage foreign
investors into the Mauritanian market, thereby improving local competitiveness, growth
and efficiency.

73.
Outcome 2: Improved mobility in targeted inter-urban roads. Under this CPS, the
ongoing rehabilitation of Nouakchott-Rosso road 20 will contribute to reducing two of the major
barriers to growth and the very high cost of transport service provision, while consolidating
Mauritania’s access to Senegal and its position as a link between Morocco and the rest of SubSaharan Africa. The objective is to reduce physical barriers to road transport along the corridor
from Nouakchott to Rosso. The project will reduce transit times and vehicle operating costs
along the corridor. The other important obstacle to inter-urban mobility is the need for a bridge
across the Senegal River, which can now be crossed only by ferry. This is particularly important
for the regions of Gorgol and Brakna which together account for 30 percent of the poor in the
country. A bridge project is being considered by the AfDB and European Commission (EC).
Operational Activities
-

In addition to the road project, the Bank will support a Local Government Development
Project aimed at developing the capacity of urban local governments to ensure better city
planning, promote economic and social integration, and provide high-quality basic
services and key infrastructure. In its first phase, the project will cover all municipalities
which are capitals of departments, as well as a group of rural local governments in the
more vulnerable areas (borders regions and the “poverty triangle,” now called “Hope
Triangle”). The participation of the department capitals will ensure good geographical
coverage, and the participation of the select rural local governments will ensure better
inclusion and poverty targeting, and help to strengthen social cohesion and stability

20

The road will be part of the reconstruction of two major road corridors to Mali (Route de l’Espoir) and Senegal
(Nouakchott-Rosso road).

27

around the country. The project will set up a new fund to provide performance-based
grants to local governments. It will also include a capacity building component to support
all actors, using a results-based approach. The project will be mainly funded by the
Government, ensuring strong ownership and likely sustainability. It will also provide an
opportunity for aid harmonization, as the performance-based fund will be designed to
receive contributions from other donors. The EU has already decided to contribute, and
other donors are expected to do so.
74.
Outcomes 3.A and 3.B: Increased cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable
electricity supply for Mauritanian households and industry, and increased electricity
exports to Senegal and Mali. The Government of Mauritania is developing a large energy
investment plan that includes a gas-to-power project (350 MW), a wind power plant (30 MW),
and a solar power plant (15 MW). This investment plan, particularly the gas-to-power project,
could more than double power generation in Mauritania and exports to Senegal and Mali, while
substantially reducing costs. This will help improve electricity connectivity for more than 50
percent of the urban population living in informal settlements. The gas-to-power project, which
will be structured as a PPP, is being developed in two phases. The first phase includes the
offshore Banda gas field production facility and pipeline (upstream sub-project); 295 MW of
generation in Nouakchott, including 80 MW of power exports to Senegal through the existing
transmission line managed by the Organization for Development of the Senegal River (OMVS);
and a transmission line to the north of the country with a target completion date of end 2015. The
second phase includes additional power generation capacity, an onshore gas pipeline to the
Tasiast mining area, and a new transmission line between Mauritania and Senegal which would
allow additional exports after its completion by end 2016.
Operational Activities
-

The Banda gas-to-power project (PRG) is currently under preparation for delivery during
the first half of the CPS period. Following its approval, efforts to develop the project as a
PPP, with IBRD and MIGA support, would be pursued. In addition, a regional project
under OMVS will upgrade the transmission line to help Senegal and Mali take up to
200MW from the gas-to-power capacity. IFC is considering financing the gas-to-power
project, subject to the structuring of an appropriate PPP.

75.
Outcome 4: Increased access to internet services. Mauritania has shown a strong
commitment to opening telecommunications to competition, and the market at the local level is
dynamic and competitive. The mobile penetration rate is with 93 percent – almost at the top of
the ECOWAS average – but the broadband market remains underdeveloped, with less than 2
percent penetration, which prevents the country from reaping the benefits of the ICT revolution
in terms of growth, job creation for all, including the unemployed youth in slums in particular,
and regional integration. The World Bank will provide both policy and lending services.
Analytical Activities
-

21

ICT policy notes: A programmatic sector dialogue will assist the line ministry and
regulatory agency in charge of ICT in drafting a new sector policy note 21 and action plan
to promote investments by telecom operators and internet service providers.

The new telecom sector policy note was approved in January 2013.

28

Operational Activities
-

West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (WARCIP). This FY13
regional project will boost regional connectivity and support a new wave of ICT reforms,
to accelerate broadband internet coverage, reduce the digital divide in Mauritania, and
pave the way for successful development of e-government and a digital economy. A key
outcome of WARCIP will be increased access to internet services (from 2 subscribers per
100 people in 2011 to 10 by 2016) through focused PPP investments in: (a) the rollout of
crucial fiber optic links to create a reliable regional and national backbone, with a ring
covering most of the population in Mauritania, and links to newly available low-cost
international capacity via the Africa Coast to Europe Submarine Cable (ACE); and (b) a
national and regional internet exchange point (IXP) and data center where e-applications
and content will be developed to transform service delivery across sectors.

76.
Outcome 5: Improved management of fishery resources. In the fisheries sector a twin
track approach is proposed with GEF/IDA on sector governance reform and port infrastructure to
increase local value added in fisheries. It would combine IBRD enclave funds for infrastructure
and GEF grants via the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP).
Analytical Activities
-

The assessment of the potential value of the sector will be updated.

Operational Activities
-

As part of the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program, the Bank is preparing a US$49
million Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for FY 13, with financing from IBRD, IDA, and
GEF. The project aims at strengthening the capacity of Mauritania to govern targeted
fisheries, to increase the contribution of these fisheries to the local economy in terms of
employment and government revenue. The project includes investment in port
construction at Tanit, 60 km from Nouakchott, which would be managed in partnership
with the private sector.

77.
Outcome 6: Improved crop yield. The Government’s Integrated Rural Development
Program (PDRI 2014-2019) will be the basis for preparation of the Bank’s new intervention in
the agricultural sector. 22 The PDRI will produce 230,000T/year by secured water management
(40,000 ha) of cereals (mainly rice). The new intervention will also increase the agricultural
intensification rate to substantially increase domestic coverage of food demand for a number of
additional value chains (milk, meat, horticultural crops). The financing requested by the
Government to support this program amounts to US$417 million over five years, to cover (a)
livestock value chain development; (b) irrigation development; (c) rain fed agriculture and
traditional livestock development; (d) wetlands agricultural development; (e) research, training
22

The Government adopted a renewed Rural Development Strategy in December 2012, and is in the process of
significantly enhancing its budget support to the sector. It is also modernizing the legal and institutional framework
for agricultural development. The Government adopted its first "Loi d' Orientation Agropastorale” (Agriculture
Sector Modernization Law, which includes livestock), and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Program (CAADP). Investments in the sector are being prioritized within a streamlined PNIA-SA (National
Agriculture and Food Security Investment Plan), of which the PDRI is one component. A longer-term national
livestock and agriculture development program (Programme National de Développement de l’Elevage et de
l’Agriculture – PNDEA 2025) is also being developed.

Integrated Water Resources Management Program (OMVS/PGIRE2)- regional
West Africa Agriculture Productivity (WAAPP)
Support Project to PDRI (PA-PDRI)

78.
The Bank response will come through a large project to support PDRI,
complementing two regional projects, namely the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program
(WAAPP) and the Integrated Water Resources Management Program (PGIRE/OMVS). All three
operations are either currently under preparation (PA-PDRI and PGIRE-OMVS) or about to be
prepared (WAAPP). Preparation of the larger PA-PDRI project (projet d’appui au programme
de développement rural intégré) is underway for Board presentation in FY14. It will include
productive investments (irrigated agriculture, rain fed agriculture and livestock development)
and strong capacity building and sector coordination activities to address the issue of low
productivity which led to the large urban migration. Co-financing from GEF and GAFSP are
expected.
79.
Outcome 7: Resilience to climate change integrated in Mauritania’s overall
development agenda. Mauritania’s environment and natural resources are steadily deteriorating
under the increasing pressures of climate change and economic development. A rapidly growing
population, large coastal urban centers, critical infrastructure, economic activities, and
ecologically sensitive areas tend to increase the risks. With its poor environmental governance,
Mauritania was ranked 161st out of 163 countries classified under the 2010 Environmental
Performance Index. The degradation of ecosystems and the decrease of biodiversity are harming
rural populations and affecting their income generating activities. The poorest people, who are
already the most severely affected, will become increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters such
as floods and droughts. Coastal zones are extremely vulnerable to natural hazards such as storm
surges, floods, and coastal erosion. Climate change will make coastal zones more vulnerable to
storms, extreme precipitation, sea level rise, and associated impacts such as salinization of water
and soils and degradation of ecosystems. Existing national and local institutional capacity and
technical knowledge are insufficient to deal efficiently with these challenges.
Analytical Activities
-

A report on inclusive green growth (IGG) in Mauritania (FY14) will provide a rapid
socioeconomic analysis of Mauritania’s priority economic sectors and a review of
existing sector-specific economic data. It will also provide examples of IGG policies
from other countries; and make country-specific recommendations for the adoption an
IGG agenda. The report will focus on: (a) the priority sectors contributing to the
country’s economy and people’s livelihoods – mining, industrial fisheries, and agropastoralism; and (b) macroeconomic and governance policies. The purpose of this review
is to identify the mechanisms necessary to convert rents into sustainable investments, and
the main constraints to adopting those mechanisms. This will involve an analysis of the
30

legal, institutional and regulatory frameworks, public expenditures, re-distributional
effects, efficiency, sustainability, and resilience issues for each sector.
Operational Activities
-

The Bank will support a Mauritania Dry Lands Management Project as part of broader
sub-regional Dry Lands Program (Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan and Somalia).
The overall project/program objective is to enhance the resilience of dry lands in order to
improve livelihoods, food security, employment, and social stability in dry areas. It will
follow a multi-sectoral approach, with activities focused on agriculture, natural resources
and water resource management, disaster risk management, infrastructure, and social
development. In addition to IDA resources, the Bank plans to leverage additional funds
from climate finance resources and the Global Environment Facility (GEF).

-

A separate GEF/Mauritania project was approved in FY11 under the Sahel and West
Africa Program (SAWAP) in support of the Great Green Wall Initiative (approximately
US$6 million from Mauritania GEF STAR Allocation), and is planned for delivery in
FY14.

Pillar 2 – Economic Governance and Service Delivery
80.
Pillar 2 activities will aim at enhancing public sector capacity to: (a) promote effective
use of the resources generated from growth; (b) support job creation through education and skills
development; and (c) address vulnerability at the household level. The Bank will aim at
consolidating and expanding the gains of the 2008-2011 CAS in improving transparency and
accountability in the management of natural resources (extractive industries and fisheries),
strengthening the performance of the civil service, and enhancing public service delivery,
particularly in the MDG-related areas of health and education. On the latter, a two-prong
approach will be supported by the Bank and introduced in the CPS: (i) a TA on health financing,
with the primary objective of helping the Government to improve the efficiency of its health
expenditures (especially through the development a strategy for result-based financing); and (ii)
a lending project in the health sector that will also leverage additional financing from the
Results-Based Financing Trust fund. Outcomes under pillar 2, including outcomes 8A, 8B, 9, 10
and 11 will contribute to the goal of poverty eradication.
81.
During the first part of the CPS period, public sector capacity building activities
started under the previous CAS will continue: PRECASP, EITI and TA/ESW (TA on public
enterprises and agencies, sector public expenditure reviews (PERs), and a Service Delivery
Indicators assessment). Given the long-term efforts necessary to deepen the reforms and advance
the institutional and capacity building programs to a point where sustainability would not be
endangered, these activities should also be pursued under the proposed capacity building.
82.
Outcome 8.A: Improved quality of basic education. The Bank will continue its efforts
in the areas of education and skills development, with a focus on improving the quality and
relevance of programs, the quality of teaching, and equity of access, particularly for middle
school students in Tagant, Hodh Charghy, Hodh Gharby, Assaba, Gorgol, and Guidimagha
regions where a large portion of the population lives in rural areas and where the transition rates
among girls from primary to lower secondary school are the lowest. These regions are the
poorest areas and are also densely populated.
31

Operational Activities
-

Basic Education Support - A new Basic Education Project is proposed to be funded under
the Global Fund for Education and will be a continuation of the basic education projects
started under the previous CAS Pillar 2. .

83.
Outcome 8.B: Improved access to technical and vocational training. As Mauritania
improves its private sector growth potential, there is a need to align vocational and professional
training of the youth and rural migrants to the needs of the labor market. A major focus will be to
modernize the management of training institutes and improve the quality of programs. Seven
technical training institutions have already negotiated performance contracts, and by 2016 at
least three programs should be certified as meeting international standards. A new regulatory
framework for private sector training institutions will also be in place, thereby increasing the
supply of programs aimed at meeting enterprise demand.
Operational Activities
- Skills Development Support Project (FY11), approved towards the end of the previous
CAS period, will continue through the new CPS period. Its objective is to improve the
relevance and efficiency of vocational and technical training, making the labor force
more responsive to market demands. An additional US$8 million in financing, made
available by cancellation of part of the Higher Education project, will allow for an
expansion of this training project.
84.
Outcome 9: Better targeting of safety net programs. Through this CPS, the Bank will
provide TA for the design of a social protection strategy and social protection policies to meet
the needs of the chronic and transitory poor. In addition, through the proposed lending operation
on health and social safety nets, the Bank will support the Government with the provision of
tools and procedures that are part of a well-functioning safety net system, including registration
and payment systems, and procedures to identify eligible beneficiaries and monitor food-insecure
populations.
Analytical Activities
- Social Safety Nets (FY14) - This TA will (a) inventory the targeting mechanisms of the
existing safety net programs, with the aim of developing a unified national mechanism; and
(b) assess the feasibility of developing a national cash transfer program. This activity will
form the basis of the social safety net operation planned for FY15. It would also contribute to
design of the health sector support operation.

32

Government request will include support to statistics, SOE and Public Agencies Governance, and
fiscal revenues from the mining sector. The capacity of national statistical system (NSS),
including the National Statistical Office (ONS), has declined sharply in recent years, leading to
lower production of basic socioeconomic data. The Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) 24 went from
68 (2009) to 58 (2012). The implementation of the National Strategy for the Development of
Statistics (NSDS) has been delayed due to the low level of funding of NSDS action plans. The
production of and open access to good quality, relevant and timely data are the prerequisite for
(a) a deeper understanding of Mauritania, society; (b) a closer monitoring of projects and
programs and the overall socioeconomic situation; (c) a serious evaluation of the impact of
projects and programs and external shocks; and (d) forecasting and modeling of future events.
Statistical development in the country is hindered by several bottlenecks, related to human
resources, governance and coordination practices, and dissemination challenges. The World
Bank Group’s support in this area materializes in a number of projects, which leverage on
technical assistance and financing instruments; more details on these activities as well as on the
Mauritanian Statistical system are available at the Annex 9 of this document. Management of
fiscal matters in the mining sector has been constrained by lack of coordination across ministries
as well as training of a dedicated team of specialists. An inter-ministerial committee has been
proposed but has yet to become operational. SOEs and public agencies are critical to
Mauritania’s economic development and service delivery, with more than 150 entities
contributing to 14 percent of GDP. However, they represent a growing fiscal risk for the country,
and there is considerable scope to improve their service delivery performance. Addressing
service delivery and fiscal risk challenges requires the introduction of reforms to improve their
governance framework.
Analytical Activities
- A State-Owned Enterprises and Public Agencies study will combine (a) a diagnostic of
the current governance framework for these institutions, with a focus on state oversight and
monitoring of fiscal risk and service delivery performance; and (b) the transfer of knowledge
and international experience. It is expected to lead to a series of policy changes and measures
to improve state capacity to improve oversight of SOEs and public agencies.
- A Service Delivery Indicator study will establish baseline indicators on service delivery in
basic health and education, including the competence and absenteeism of health practitioners
and teachers. The review is part of an Africa-wide human development study that has already
been carried out in Senegal, Tanzania and Kenya. It will provide a baseline for future
interventions aimed at improving the quality of social service delivery, and will complement
future public expenditure reviews.
- A Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) will
assess implementation of the BOOST methodology, designed to help organize public
expenditure data for easy analysis and dissemination to the public. The Bank team will work
with local authorities to conduct the review, which will focus on broad trends and at least one
social sector. It will be complemented by assessments of public financial management and
procurement policies and procedures. Particular attention will be given to the way in which
mineral revenues are managed.

- Strengthening the Accounting Profession and Enhancing Accounting and Auditing
Practices. ROSC action plan implementation. Weaknesses in accounting and auditing
practices are a significant constraint on private sector development. Both local and
particularly foreign investment is strongly linked to the reliability of financial reporting and
audit and use of internationally comparable accounting and auditing standards. A ROSC
accounting and audit exercise was undertaken in Mauritania. The report have been approved
by the Government and published.
Operational Activities
-

Public Sector Capacity Building. The Bank’s involvement in public sector capacity building
has included co-financing of the population census through the Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (PRECASP, FY07, ongoing); as well as preparation of the Trust Fund for
Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) grant to support improvement of NSS and ONS
management, data collection (national accounts, enterprises, livestock, and swamp
management), and data dissemination. Harmonized partner support to the whole statistical
system will be organized through implementation of the NSDS.

-

The proposed IDA-funded capacity building operation will focus on SOE governance,
management of fiscal revenues from the mining sector, and statistical capacity development.
This operation aims to (a) improve the corporate governance of SOEs and public agencies by
strengthening oversight capacity, improving the availability of consolidated financial data,
and enhanced internal control and board management of SOEs and public agencies; and (b)
increase the statistical capacity of NSS and ONS, including the production and dissemination
of basic statistics. Open access to data (anonymized) will also be the subject of policy
dialogue between the Bank and the Mauritanian authorities.

-

The existing PRISM-2 is supporting capacity building on taxation and fiscal issues related to
the extractive industries. Moreover, the proposed Capacity Building Project will further
support institutional strengthening as well as training of staff of the ministries involved in
extractive industries including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and
Mines, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and possibly the Treasury.
Outcome 11: Improved financial management at decentralized/local government levels.
Operational Activities

-

Local Government Development Project will set up a new fund to provide grants to local
governments, based on their performance in the areas of accountability and participatory
planning and budgeting. The project will also include a results-based capacity building
component that will support all actors involved in decentralization and local NGOs. The
project is being prepared and funded mainly by the Government, ensuring strong ownership
and likely sustainability. It will also provide an opportunity for aid harmonization, as the
performance-based grant fund is designed to receive contributions from other donors,
including the EC.

Cross-Cutting Issue: Gender
86.
All CPS activities will include a gender component, making gender an integrated
consideration in all lending and advisory activities. In addition, an ESW on gender indicators is
currently being carried out on a regional basis, it includes Mauritania. Further, the inclusion of
34

dedicated new activities on gender in the CPS through capacity building/TA operations as part of
a “high reward/high risk approach” (high risk due to Mauritania’s socio-cultural environment)
will also be exploded.

III. IMPLEMENTING THE FY14-16 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

3.1.

Managing Program Implementation

87.
The proposed FY14-16 CPS program will be implemented by Government
implementing organizations (IOs) and project implementation units (PIUs), with close
support from WBG teams. Due to existing capacity limitations and other structural issues of
the public administration, most PIUs still are not fully mainstreamed into the respective IOs. It
will be crucial to build mechanisms that allow for the transfer for knowledge and skills related to
project management, including strategic planning, fiduciary management, and monitoring and
evaluation, from PIU staff to respective IO staff. This can be done by including IO staff in
training events, creating opportunities for knowledge transfer, and twinning arrangements.
Further, terms of reference for externally hired technical consultants should include the
requirement to make appropriate arrangements for capacity development of local counterparts.
88.
In addition to close follow-up on implementation by sector teams, program
implementation will be regularly reviewed through annual Country Program Performance
Reviews. Progress on the implementation of the proposed CPS will be assessed in the course of
a mid-term review and subsequent elaboration of a CPS Progress Report.

3.2.

Partnerships and Donor Coordination

89.
The content of this CPS concept note is based on preliminary discussions with the
Government; consultations with other donors in Mauritania; exchanges with the
authorities during the visit of the new Country Director to Mauritania in early 2011; and
further exchanges with the Government during the Spring Meetings and Annual Meetings in
Washington in 2011. Additional consultations were held in Nouakchott from 25-27 September
2012 with civil society and religious leaders, parliamentarians, representatives of the private
sector, donors, and Government officials. All stakeholders expressed overwhelming support for
the two pillars of the proposed CPS. The following guiding questions were posed to participants:
Question 1: Do you think that Bank intervention in Mauritania is pertinent? Question 2: In
relation to the positions of other donors, do you think the Bank should be more selective in its
positioning? Question 3: What do you think about the positioning of the Bank in relation to the
Government’s priorities as defined in the PRPS for 2011-2015?
90.
Numerous recommendations were voiced and additional interventions proposed (for
a detailed summary, see Annex 6). The following were mentioned by all stakeholder groups:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Professional training of civil servants;
More TA and advisory assistance by the Bank;
More interventions in the health sector, particularly related to HIV/AIDS and food
safety;
More support for implementation of governance reforms;
Engagement in the justice sector, particularly training of judges and judicial staff;
More attention to gender and social protection;
Improved capacity for statistics and data collection.

91.
Aid harmonization is an important issue in Mauritania. In addition to significant
assistance from the AfDB, EC, UN organizations, and bilateral donors, Mauritania benefits from
36

substantial assistance from Arab funds and from China, which recently increased its support. The
Bank has several ongoing operations in Mauritania with these partners, and others are proposed
for FY14. The 2008-2009 events had a negative impact on the strong coordination arrangements
that existed at the start of the previous CAS. To reestablish their harmonization and alignment
framework, the donors agreed, at a meeting held in Brussels in June 2010, to come together
around the key themes of the PRSP-3. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development
(MAED) is playing role in those arrangements, which are summarized in section 1.6 above.
Collaboration with the private sector is also increasing under the PRSP-3, in the context of EITI
implementation, support for the School of Mines, vocational training for mine workers, and
potentially transformational public-private partnerships for infrastructure development.

3.3.

Monitoring and Evaluation

92.
On the Government side, detailed arrangements for monitoring and evaluating the
progress of the PRSP are laid out in its Pillar 5. On the World Bank side, a CPS implementation
monitoring system similar to that used for the 2008-11 CAS will allow for adequate review of
World Bank contributions toward Mauritania’s development. Indicators to be used to track
outputs and outcomes will be incorporated in the CPS results matrix, which will also include a
list of milestones and intermediate outcomes. The CPS implementation monitoring system will
be closely linked to the Government’s PRSP monitoring system.
IV. MANAGING RISKS
93.
Implementation of the new CPS could face three major risks: (a) political instability; (b)
low capacity of the administration; and (c) vulnerability of Mauritania’s economy to external
shocks.
94.
On the first point, Mauritania’s recent history has demonstrated that internal political
risks are high, and are not likely to disappear during the CPS period, particularly during and
immediately following the next presidential election, scheduled for the first half of 2014. In
addition, the Sahel region is threatened by expanding AQMI activities, and there is a risk of more
spillover effects from the crisis in Mali. Given these circumstances, the risks are not negligible
that some WBG development programs and current reform efforts could be stalled. On the other
hand, the strong momentum for development and poverty reduction in Mauritania has been
maintained since 2000 despite political disruptions. There is a continuing and broad consensus
throughout Mauritania that the objectives, content, and approach of specific Bank-supported
programs are appropriate. As the proposed new operations are understood to be a continuation of
ongoing efforts, they are likely to be relatively immune to political developments.
95.
Improvements in governance are crucial to avoiding risks of further corruption in the
mining and fisheries sectors, which are also key areas of intervention in this CPS. In addition to
the fiduciary mitigation measures embodied in each of Bank-funded operations, this CPS will
provide support to improve governance in the fishery sector as well as a capacity building
program to improve governance of SOEs and public agencies, and extractive industries. The Bank
will continue to support reforms on public procurement. The reforms set up the institutional
framework and support capacity building and (i) further integrate procurement as part of budget
preparation and budget execution, (ii) all procurement plans prepared during budget preparation,
(iii) strengthen procurement oversight through regular audits and (iv) annual technical audit of
37

procurement implemented by contracting Authorities. The importance of fully achieving the
governance agenda cannot be minimized, given the existence of entrenched interests and the
temptation to try and capture the rents from natural resources. However, the current authorities
have shown a strong commitment to advancing the governance agenda, as evidenced by the
progress made on the EITI validation process. There is broad consensus among the political
parties and civil society to keep governance at the forefront of the development agenda.
96.
The proposed dual approach – combining (a) low-risk/good-return ongoing and follow-up
operations with (b) some new high risk/high return actions –is appropriate to achieve
development objectives (including some transformative change) while mitigating risks. The midterm review of PRSP-3 implementation, which will coincide with the timing of the CPS
Completion Report and the next presidential election, will provide an opportunity for stocktaking
and for launching new initiatives, possibly including high-risk/high reward activities consistent
with WBG goals. A close analysis of the country’s political economy during the next three years
will be essential to identify and prepare the most appropriate activities going forward.
97.
In terms of insufficient capacity of the administration, the Government is fully aware of
the challenge, as highlighted in PRSP-3, and has requested capacity-building support from all
key development partners. Most development partners, including the Bank Group in this CPS,
have responded by including capacity building in their assistance strategies, either as a specific
pillar or as a cross-cutting theme. The continuing emphasis on capacity building and improving
governance should also reduce the risks to sustainability of the reform efforts.
98.
In terms of vulnerability to external shocks, which the PRSP-3 identifies as a key
challenge, the Government aims to build resilience to shocks such as falling revenues from
mining and fisheries, and climatic events that threaten agriculture and food security, by pursuing
prudent policies. WBG engagement in the sectors vulnerable to external shocks is subject to the
same set of risks identified above. The small oil fund, for example, helped to mitigate the effects
of the 2011 drought. The Bank and the IMF will advise the Government on establishing a
mining fund with even greater potential to provide a buffer against shocks. Most ongoing
operations and a number of proposed new operations under the CPS also aim at reducing
vulnerability through economic diversification, mitigation, and social protection.

Annex 2: CAS Completion Report
REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT
Summary
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses program
performance and World Bank performance with the FY08-11 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Mauritania, which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors
in July 2007 (Report No. 39532-MR); it covers a period up to March 31, 2012. During
this time, Mauritania experienced various political events along with economic shocks
and setbacks. First, a 2008 military coup led to major political disruptions and external
aid was suspended, including that of the Bank, for more than a year, until the return to
constitutional order and new elections in 2009. Second, the new off-shore oil production
for which Mauritania had high expectations, proved disappointing, with actual production
declining rapidly to levels considerably below those anticipated. Third, a drought affected
agriculture and high international food prices, in particular, hit a large part of the
population. These events affected Mauritania’s economic performance and the
implementation of the CAS.
2.
Based on staff self-assessment, the performance of the CAS program is assessed
as moderately unsatisfactory: out of 23 outcomes, only 10 were achieved (mainly under
pillar 2 – Establishing growth in the economic sphere of the poor). The Bank
performance is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. Although the Bank has
demonstrated flexibility and agility in adjusting the program to the country context, in
particular following the re-engagement in 2009 after a year of suspension under O.P 7.30,
it did not prepare a progress report to reflect the changes, including a revised results
framework for the CAS.
3.
There are lessons learnt from the implementation from the previous CAS, in
particular (a) development can be achieved even in the most challenging situation, (b)
even if weak human and administrative capacity is a pervasive problem, it can be
mitigated in areas where the Bank has long term engagement; (c) development impact –
particularly transformational change is not necessarily linked to the amount of financing
provided by the Bank; if well directed, limited IDA can leverage additional financing for
transformative projects. The design of the upcoming CPS embodies these lessons. The
upcoming CPS focus would to use the limited IDA to leverage financing for
transformational change, takings advantage of the windfall of revenues resulting from the
discovery of mineral resources and political stability to create jobs and improve
resilience; thus laying the ground for sustainable and inclusive growth.
Context and Objectives of the CAS
4.
Mauritania is mostly a desert country, with a population of over 3 million. Its
production basis and exports include a small range of commodities (fish, iron ore and
gold). While growth had averaged 4 percent from 2000-2005, GDP soared to 11.7 percent
43

in 2006 due to the first oil revenues, with oil production from an off-shore field. While
production reached 54,000 bpd in the first three months, it decreased significantly soon
after, well below the expected 75,000 bpd, because of technical difficulties. 26 Still, the
macro-economic situation continued to improve due to higher iron ore sales by the
National Iron Ore Company (SNIM) and increased fish exports. Also, exports increased
with the start of private mining operations of copper (Akjoujt) and gold (Tasiast).
5.
The country has faced many internal governance challenges. In August 2005, a
bloodless military coup ended the 21-year presidency of President Ould Taya. 27 A
transition government quickly returned to democracy and approved a new constitution;
legislative and presidential elections were held in late 2006 and early 2007. The new
government launched a constructive dialogue with development partners and committed
to a development agenda that focused on economic governance. It took a number of key
steps 28 that broke with earlier practices. First, transition authorities and then the newly
elected government moved to re-establish a stable macro-budgetary framework. The IMF
approved a new PRGF in December 2006. As a result, Mauritania was granted debt
relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Overall, the population and
Mauritania’s partners had high hopes after these political developments and particularly
with the start of a new era marked by oil production. The PRSP -2 (2006-2010) that
served as a basis for the 2008-2011 CAS was thus prepared in a highly optimistic
environment.
6.
The PRSP-2 (for 2006-2010) proposed an ambitious poverty reduction strategy
based on a set of sound macroeconomic, structural, and sectoral policies through 2015. It
had five key components: (a) accelerating growth and maintaining macroeconomic
equilibrium; (b) anchoring economic growth among the poor; (c) developing human
resources and providing access to basic social services; (d) strengthening good
governance and capacity building; and (e) reinforcing monitoring, evaluation, and
coordination. PRSI-2 focused on how to manage the wealth from natural resources
transparently. Its objectives were closely aligned with the MDGs. The goal of reducing
the poverty rate to 25 percent by 2015 and eliminating hunger were anticipated—if public
revenues would be spent efficiently.
7.
The 2008-2011 CAS presented to the Board in July 2007 was closely aligned with
PRSP-2. It was the first CAS for Mauritania. It was prepared through a highly
participatory process and collaborative approach between the World Bank Group, the
government and development partners to ensure its objectives were aligned with country
needs. Consultations included two workshops with 200 representatives from donor
organizations, ministries and civil society. The CAS stressed that Mauritania was at a

They quickly declined and remained below 20,000 bl/d after mid-2007. Hydrocarbon reserves were still considered
as modest: ie. The country’s proven and probable crude oil reserves were estimated at 310 million barrels in 2008,
compared with 2.1 billion for Chad.

He come to power under the 1984 coup and faced a failed coup attempt in 2003.
28
(a) treating oil revenues with transparency in the 2006 and 2007 budgets and engaging in prudent fiscal and
monetary policies; (b) creating a National Hydrocarbon Revenue Fund (NHRF); (c) adhering to the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and (d) seeking support and technical assistance (TA) in the oil sector from
the Bank

critical political and economic crossroads—politically, with a new, democratically
elected and reform-minded government, and economically, with the oil revenues as a
source of wealth and boost to development. Its overall goal was to strengthen economic
governance, build public sector capacity and help improve the investment climate, while
continuing to fight poverty and inequalities.
8.
A major constraint was the limited, new IDA financing, particularly for the
remainder of the IDA-14 period (FY06-FY08) with a high-case scenario IDA resource
allocation (including IDA-15) available for the CAS-period estimated at US$41 million
only. 29 The CAS thus suggested introducing IBRD instruments (loans and guarantees) as
additional sources of funds for projects with private sector involvement (ports and a
power plant), ideally combined with IFC/MIGA interventions. Also, a large number (11)
of projects started before 2007 continued and significantly required implementation
capacity and government attention, as well as WB staff resources.
9.
The CAS anticipated that Mauritania might transition from low-income status to
that of a middle income country (MIC) status with its GNI boosted by oil revenues. Thus,
it proposed preparing the country to reach this point, essentially with an AAA and only
one new IDA operation. Through this operation, the Private/Financial Sector Technical
Assistance project, 30 the Bank planned to re-engage with the private sector and address
the financial and private sector development issues, collaborating with IFC and MIGA.
10.
It aimed to maximize its impact by leveraging the Bank’s advantage as knowledge
institution with its convening power, by being selective and realistic about what projects
to finance and their likely impact and with the AAA. The CAS used a new approach
based on assessments of sectoral needs, relative added value/expertise and levels of
engagement, to align donor activities and coordination in the spirit of the Paris
Declaration. It presented a comprehensive analysis of Mauritania’s major development
challenges, 31 as well as specific ones in each of the PRSP components, along with
remedial actions. The small number of new IDA operations (due to IDA financing
constraints) was meant to leverage other financing, in particular the government own
resources , hence increasing the impact of IDA resources.
11.
The CAS was articulated around four components, the same as the PRSP-2 pillars
I to IV: 32
1. Accelerating growth and maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium;
2. Anchoring growth in the economic environment of the poor;
29

This was due to high levels of lending with aggressive front-loading in FY06 and FY07 (for national projects and
Mauritania’s participation in regional projects), plus the impact of netting-out MDRI debt service relief on Mauritania’s
allocation, and a mediocre portfolio performance at the time the IDA envelope was calculated.
30
Focussing on increasing non-oil investment in the economy and on improving the soundness and efficiency of the
Mauritanian financial system, and providing support to prepare public private partnerships in the energy sector.
31
(a) Mauritania is at critical crossroads where proper management of oil revenues is key; (b) its economy may already
be experiencing Dutch disease effects; (c) Mauritania does not take full advantage of its strategic geographic location;
(d) Social characteristics hamper equitable growth and could cause tensions; and (e) human resource capacity is weak;
(f) gender issues remain a key challenge.
32
Pillar V. Reinforcing strategic oversights of program, M&E, and coordination is not explicitly included in the CAS.

45

3. Developing human resources and broadening access to basic social services;
4. Improving good governance and capacity building.
A list of lending and non-lending activities of the CAS is respectively included in Table 2
and Table 3. The CAS included a results matrix that included outcomes against which the
CAS achievements will be measured.
12.
The CAS pointed to the following risks: (a) a slowing or reversal in government
commitment to reform, (b) economic vulnerability to external shocks, and (c) an
uncertain transition to MIC status, with insufficient aid to help it. Some of these risks
have materialized, and although the political risk was rated as slow in the CPS, it turned
out to be a major one that has hampered the implementation of the CAS.
Developments and Adjustments during CAS Implementation
13.
The 2008-2011 CAS consisted of three different phases with quite different
governments and relations with the Bank: (a) the pre-2008 events phase, with a strong
dialogue and high (overly optimistic) expectations, during which pre-CAS projects were
implemented smoothly; (b) the political crisis, starting with the 2008 coup and the freeze
of operations until late 2010; and (c) re-engagement with a completely new government.
14.
CAS implementation had barely started when the country was hit by successive
shocks which deeply affected the political environment and weighed heavily on its
economic performance. Initially, there were two positive developments, with first the
Consultative Group meetings in December 2007, jointly prepared by the government, WB,
EU and UNDP, and where US$2.1 billion of support was committed. A second event was
the January 2008 visit of the Bank’s President during which a MoU for a possible IBRD
power generation project was signed. However, by August 2008, the country’s civilian
president, elected in 2007, was removed from office by yet another military coup that
established a High Council of State (HCE), composed of officers under General
Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, to head the country. The Mauritanian political community
was split between HCE partisans and opponents. This crisis led the international
community to put most of its activities on hold. According to OP/BP 7.30 (dealing with
de facto governments), the Bank suspended disbursements and missions.
15.
After strong condemnation of the coup and sustained international pressure,
negotiations lead to the Dakar agreement between the HCE, all political parties and key
foreign partner countries and organizations on a date to return to democratic rule and
elections. Presidential elections 33 were held in July 2009, a transitional national unity
government was created and international sanctions were rapidly lifted.
16.
The impact of the 2008-2009 events was significant: (a) the reform process was
disrupted; (b) Mauritania’s fiscal situation and economic performance deteriorated
sharply. The deterioration was compounded by the effects of the food (2008) and fuel price
33

The Constitutional court and the international community recognized the results of the elections watched by
international observers. Former general Ould Abdel Aziz won with 52% of the votes.

46

shocks, and the global financial crisis (2009); (c) non-oil GDP growth dropped from 5.9
percent in 2007 to 4.1 percent in 2008 and –0.9 percent in 2009; 34 (d) on the domestic
political front, successive government adjustments included changing ministers in key
ministries (including Finance) which continued in 2010, with mergers or splitting of
ministries and creating new ones. This also caused a high turnover of civil servants at high
levels, which meant a serious loss of institutional memory including about the reforms
started in 2007. M&E capacity was essentially lost in many areas and the National
Statistical Office (ONS) capabilities also declined sharply; (e) simultaneously, WB teams
were also changing, with many key staff having left the country office for other
assignments during the crisis and others leaving thereafter. Also, the country’s decreasing
attractiveness for WB staff and those of all partner organizations was compounded by
concerns for physical security35; (f) Bank operations were also handicapped when its
country manager left (in January 2010) and was not replaced for another seven months. 36
17.
The impact of the 2008-2009 events on Bank operations has been uneven, but
generally negative. For many projects, implementation was interrupted or considerably
slowed for 14-24 months. In a few exceptions, it continued slowly, mostly when
authorities used their counterpart funds to finance critical actions. This occurred in urban
development (a PDU project), Community Driven Development (CDD) in rural areas
(PDRC), mining sector project (PRISM), and education sector project (PNDSE),
primarily due to stable project implementation units that were created before 2007 with
Ban’s suppor. This strongly confirms the need for stability and long-term continuity of
Bank operations and teams, particularly in fragile environments. Due to the delays,
closing dates for ongoing operations had to be extended—on average by two years—in
order for the projects to complete activities and achieve their development objectives by
the new date.
18.
Table 2 includes all lending activities and Table 4 presents all projects that were
under implementation during the CAS period (2008-20011). The IDA 15 envelope
reached US$36 million and the WB helped mobilize other funds from the Africa
Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF), Education for All/Catalytic Fund (EFA/CF), Crisis
Response Window (CRW) and GEF. Five new projects and two additional financing
operations to existing projects were approved in FY08-FY11. Total financing from all
sources was US$92.1 million (of which US$58.1 million was from both IDA) compared
to the IDA allocation for the CAS-period of US$41 million as projected under the CAS
high case scenario. The new projects were: (a) the Business Environment Enhancement
project (BEEP, US$5 million from IDA), to support financial and private sector
development issues, increase non-oil investments, and make the financial system more
efficient; (b) the Education Sector Program (ESDP , US$14 million from the Education
For All-Catalytic Fund) to accelerate the implementation of the government's Education
Sector Development Program; (c) the Transport Sector and Institutional Development
34

With the fast-declining offshore oil production, overall GDP growth varied from 11.4% in 2006, to 3.7T in 2008 and
-1.1% in 2009.
35
Various terrorist attacks and hostage-taking by AQMI started in 2006 to seriously affect the country’s image as a
relatively safe country in the region. Also, they have increasingly forced the government to address security concerns,
possibly at the expense of long-term development.
36
This followed a similar occurrence in 2004-2005.

47

TA project (US$4.5 million from IDA) to provide institutional support and capacitybuilding to improve the management of the road, maritime and air transport sectors; (d)
the Nouakchott-Rosso Road Corridor Rehabilitation Project (US$20 million, from the
Accelerated Catalytic Growth Fund) to rehabilitate the road with parallel EU financing;
and (e) the Skills Development Support project (US$16 million from IDA) to improve
the quality and efficiency of training institutions and create an enabling environment for a
more market-driven technical and vocational training (TVET). Additional financing was
approved for (a) the second Mining Sector Capacity Building Project (US$7.1 million
from IDA) to scale up ongoing activities and offer new education and vocational training
support; and (b) the Urban Development Project (US$25.5 million from IDA including
US$15.5 million from the IDA CRW) to scale-up its basic urban infrastructure
component.
19.
Thus, all but two of the projects proposed in the CAS base-case were launched.
Although some were delayed, they were introduced partly due to finances other than from
IDA. The exceptions were the two IBRD public-private partnership (PPP) projects (for
the ports and energy). Despite significant preparation efforts (involving IFC), the
projects did not materialize due to the political events and particularly the complexity of
such new operations in the difficult, prevailing environment. No new regional projects
involving Mauritania were begun but three ongoing ones37 were actively pursued. The
WB mobilized an added US$1.66 in Trust Funds (TF) for five new activities, including
EITI implementation, Mineral and Petroleum Institutional Capacity Building and an
Extractive Industries/Transaction Advisory Facility, which were critical for the extractive
industries. As of end of January 2013, Mauritania portfolio included eight active IDA
operations (including two regional projects), representing a total commitment of $125.1
million. Overall, the performance of the portfolio is satisfactory, with one problem
project (i.e. the High Education Projects) for which restructuring is ongoing.
20.
AAA activities (see table 3) were also delayed or cancelled. The limited
analytical work carried out and lack of macro-monitoring during 2008-2009 and the slow
resumption afterwards also had some effects. For example, the WB was not able, until
the FY010 Public Expenditure Review (PER) completion. , to grasp the results of the
post-2008 Government measures that considerably increased the role of the public sector38
in the economy.
Regarding the AAAs, work continued on procurement and fulfilled most of the
analyses planned under the CAS. Significant non-lending included the policy notes for
the new government, the PER, the Source of Growth study, and the Fisheries and ICT
sector notes; however, neither the land tenure analysis nor the CAS Progress Report were
done. The CAS remained relevant in the context of economic and political turbulence and
no major reorientation was considered necessary after 2009. The new government

(a) Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP); (b) the Senegal River Basin Multi-purpose Water Resources
Development Project; and (c) West African Power Pool (WAPP) – OMVS Felou Hydroelectric Project.

38

This included creating companies (public transport, housing, a public Bank, and an expansion in the government
power supply)

48

remained broadly committed to the CAS orientation which stressed infrastructure,
particularly urban works with quick results, and also governance.
Program Performance Evaluation
22.
Program performance is evaluated in Table 1, around 23 outcomes. As indicated
above, it is important to underscore that the implementation of the CAS was negatively
impacted by the suspension of Bank’s activities in 20008. Program performance assessed
is moderately unsatisfactory; with 8 outcomes achieved, 11 partially achieved and 4 not
achieved.
23.
In Pillar 1 (Accelerating Growth and Macro-Economic Framework), progress is
mixed: Two outcomes achieved (oil and mining), three partly achieved, but with more
under way, and three not achieved (with limited progress expected). The PRISM-2 and
EITI contributed a great deal to developing institutional capacity and improving
governance in the key extractive industry sector. ESW and expanded new dialogue in
fisheries are likely to lead to reforming governance and to a new project increasing local
value-added. The Business Environment Enhancement Project has improved financial
sector regulation and strengthened it in general, but much remains to be done to address
problems in the business climate. The transport TA project has significantly improved the
sector’s institutional capacity. While the regional power project will soon increase power
supply for Mauritania, efforts to develop the IBRD enclave Gas to Power PPP were
moving forward only slowly. The PER addressed the fiscal issues and exposed flaws in
governance/monitoring and fiscal threats from Mauritania expanded Public Enterprises
sector.
24.
In Pillar 2 (Establishing Growth in the Economic Sphere of the Poor), progress is
much more encouraging: Three outcomes were achieved (particularly improvements in
rural communities and basic services & employment in urban areas) and three were partly
achieved (with more progress underway for micro-credit). The PDIAIM APL second
phase achieved mixed results in irrigation, but not enough restructuring for agriculture
credit. The PRDC, with its CDD approach, has greatly succeeded in improving village
living conditions, with sustainable income increases, access to basic social and economic
services, and improved natural resource management (along with the GEF CommunityBased Watershed Management Project). The Urban Development Program has largely
succeeded in improving urban management, providing more infrastructures, and
strengthening decentralization; it created a momentum upon which the government is
building a new major program to be financed in great part by the budget. The
Mauritanian component of the regional Locust Project set up a fully operational control
system that prevented locust outbreaks in 2009 and 2011.
25.
There were good progress under Pillar 3 (Developing Human Resources and
Generalizing Access to Services), with three outcomes achieved, 39 three partly achieved
with more progress underway, and only one not achieved (gender and social protection).
With the PNDSE and EFA-CF, the primary education sub-sector was able to see
39

Outcome 18 being split in two: access to HIV/AIDS treatment (achieved) and maternal health (partially achieved).

49

substantial progress in access and there are good indications that internal efficiency is
improving. Mauritania is on track to reach the education-related MDGs for gender
equality and enrollment at the primary level. With the Higher Education Project, progress
has been good towards improving the quality of teaching and learning, and the relevance
of courses to the labor market (it established pedagogic, administrative and financial
management systems and improved capacity in the higher education institutions. The
recently approved Skills Development Support Project will further improve the relevance
and efficiency of vocational and technical training, making them more responsive to
market demands and reinforcing their institutional framework. The HIV/AIDS-MAP
project has achieved its goals of increasing coverage and using HIV prevention services,
of medical treatment and social care, especially for high risk and vulnerable populations.
The now closed Health and Nutrition project was instrumental in capacity building,
helping the health sector improve performance and prepare its future development. It
partly achieved its objectives in increasing access to health services in underserved areas
and in improving maternal health. It contributed significantly to improving nutrition and
convincing the government to put nutrition on its agenda. The PDU also helped improve
access to potable water, sanitation and electricity in urban and peri-urban areas. Specific
CAS activities in various projects targeting female beneficiaries (PDU, education, PDRC)
were broadly successful.
26.
In Pillar 4 (Improving Good Governance and Capacity Building), progress is
encouraging, with the two outcomes partly achieved but with more work under way and
strong prospects for speedy achievement on all fronts. The PRECASP has greatly helped
advance human resources management in public administration. Similarly, it has
significantly improved public finance management (progressive PFM reform and
reinforcing State-controlled bodies), and helped the government adopt a comprehensive
long-term public finance agenda and an anti-corruption strategy. Bank support of the
procurement reform created strong momentum for reforming public procurement, with
significant achievements already in the production of laws, regulations and institutional
building. WB efforts to support the EITI validation process helped Mauritania reach EITI
compliance status in early 2012. The PDU has successfully supported the completion of
the first decentralization pilots in large cities, and with PRECASP, created momentum for
scaling-up decentralization throughout the country.
WB Performance
27.
The WB overall performance is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. The
design, around the PRSP-2 four components, was well linked to Mauritania’s
development priorities and the government strategy presented in the PRSP. It was carried
out with the aim of selecting specific strategies to maximize impact, but was constrained
by (a) the scarcity of IDA funds and (b) the fact that many operations 40 started under the
previous CAS were to be pursued, requiring substantial WB staff resources and
government attention. The CAS report provided a sharp analysis 41 of the PRSP-2
challenges and beyond—those that could not all be addressed given the limited resources
40

Notwithstanding the fact those were still fully relevant and overall well designed to address Mauritania’s challenges
It is still fully relevant now as a basis for the new CAS.

50

(of the WB and others). The program rightly focused on the areas that were relevant for
Mauritania’s development, including developing (a) the private sector and basic
infrastructure, (b) urban areas, (c) rural areas, (d) governance, emphasizing public
administration and economic governance, and (e) social sectors. The choice of the
outcome indicators for the CAS results matrix was adequate.
28.
Considering the IDA funding constraints, there were no major shortcomings in the
program, except the decision not to continue preparing the urban water supply/sanitation
TA project. 42. In areas where the WB had been absent (fisheries, for decades, and ICT for
a couple of years), the program correctly proposed preparing re-engagement and
deepening the dialogue through ESW/TA—an approach validated by the strong prospects
of having two comprehensive operations approved in the near future. The choice of
instruments was basically correct and the selection of ESW themes appropriate. The
decision to develop IBRD projects around PPPs in transport and energy was logical and
not too bold at the time (before the 2008 coup) since the authorities were open to new
initiatives of that kind. 43 The related plans to leverage IFC services/investments and
MIGA work were also appropriate.
29.
The CAS report was broadly correct in identifying most risks. But, impressed by
the strong reform signals sent by the post-2006 government, it did not carry out a sharp
enough analysis of Mauritania’s political economy, which mirrored that of a fragile state.
The WB, like most donors, underestimated the extent of political risk and proposed a
weak risk-mitigation approach. Considering the country’s history, the CAS was
unrealistic in that area, as it did not account for (a) a one-two year slippage in most
projects, (b) delay in reforms, and (c) uncertain prospect for the proposed IBRD projects
have shown.
30.
The Bank adjusted with flexibility to the country conditions throughout the
implementation of the CAS. The WB worked intensely to engage the post-2006
government to prepare a CAS in a participatory manner and setting an ambitious reform
and development agenda, which led to the successful 2007 Consultative Group meeting.
Likewise, it rapidly re-engaged with the ongoing operations in late 2009. It speedily
resumed disbursements on ongoing projects (by September 2009), and conducted a multisector assessment mission. Projects for which the closing date had passed during the
suspension were extended retroactively. The Country office helped to swiftly reactivate
disbursements, including those for critical human development programs and obligations to
vendors. It also facilitated early missions to assess the status of the projects, the macro and
fiscal situation, and the latest developments in key sectors. However, with limited cofinancing or parallel financing for the new CAS operations, the WB has been less
successful in leveraging assistance from other donors. The Bank did not prepare a
progress report to reflect the changes that occurred following the re-engagement.
42

Well prepared until 2006 and which the critical current situation of SNDE vindicates (as the program for Aftout
Saheli water supply financed by other donors did not adequately address institutional, financial and distribution
aspects).
43
The recent bankruptcy of Mauritania Airways, a new joint-venture between foreign partners and domestic investors,
created public resentment and skepticism towards private investment public services.

51

31.
The IDA 15 envelope reached US$36 million and the WB helped mobilize other
funds from the Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF), Education for All/Catalytic Fund
(EFA/CF), Crisis Response Window (CRW) and GEF. Five new projects and two
additional financing operations to existing projects were approved in FY08-FY11. Total
financing from all sources was US$92.1 million (of which US$58.1 million was from both
IDA) compared to the IDA allocation for the CAS-period of US$41 million as projected
under the CAS high case scenario. The new projects were: (a) the Business Environment
Enhancement project (BEEP, US$5 million from IDA), to support financial and private
sector development issues, increase non-oil investments, and make the financial system
more efficient; (b) the Education Sector Program (ESDP , US$14 million from the
Education For All-Catalytic Fund) to accelerate the implementation of the government's
Education Sector Development Program; (c) the Transport Sector and Institutional
Development TA project (US$4.5 million from IDA) to provide institutional support and
capacity-building to improve the management of the road, maritime and air transport
sectors; (d) the Nouakchott-Rosso Road Corridor Rehabilitation Project (US$20 million,
from the Accelerated Catalytic Growth Fund) to rehabilitate the road with parallel EU
financing; and (e) the Skills Development Support project (US$16 million from IDA) to
improve the quality and efficiency of training institutions and create an enabling
environment for a more market-driven technical and vocational training (TVET).
Additional financing was approved for (a) the second Mining Sector Capacity Building
Project (US$7.1 million from IDA) to scale up ongoing activities and offer new education
and vocational training support; and (b) the Urban Development Project (US$25.5
million from IDA including US$15.5 million from the IDA CRW) to scale-up its basic
urban infrastructure component.
32.
Thus, all but two of the projects proposed in the CAS base-case were launched.
Although some were delayed, they were introduced partly due to finances other than from
IDA. The exceptions were the two IBRD public-private partnership (PPP) projects (for the
ports and energy). Despite significant preparation efforts (involving IFC), the projects did
not materialize due to the political events and particularly the complexity of such new
operations in the difficult, prevailing environment. No new regional projects involving
Mauritania were begun but three ongoing ones 44 were actively pursued. The WB mobilized
an added US$1.66 in Trust Funds (TF) for five new activities, including EITI
implementation, Mineral and Petroleum Institutional Capacity Building and an Extractive
Industries/Transaction Advisory Facility, which were critical for the extractive industries.
33.
Regarding the AAAs, work continued on procurement and fulfilled most of the
analyses planned under the CAS. It also included several added tasks (see Table 3).
Significant non-lending included the policy notes for the new government, the PER, the
Source of Growth study, and the Fisheries and ICT sector notes; however, neither the
land tenure analysis nor the CAS Progress Report were done. The CAS remained relevant
in the context of economic and political turbulence and no major reorientation was
considered necessary after 2009. The new government remained broadly committed to
44

(a) Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP); (b) the Senegal River Basin Multi-purpose Water Resources
Development Project; and (c) West African Power Pool (WAPP) – OMVS Felou Hydroelectric Project.

52

the CAS orientation which stressed infrastructure, particularly urban works with quick
results, and also governance.
34.
A set of 15 sector policy notes was also prepared by the Bank team with
Mauritanian counterparts to help the government and donors identify immediate and
medium-term actions to restart the economy and reforms. The Bank was also able to
confirm the increase of Mauritania’s IDA 15 allocation 45 to US$36 million. On March
2010, the IMF approved a 3-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) agreement for about
US$118.1 million. 46 Economic recovery was then discussed at the Brussels Round Table in
June 2010, at which total pledges of US$3.2 billion were made for 2010-2015 (including
US$365 million for the whole World Bank Group). Discussions were based on the sector
policy notes (mentioned above) which also laid the foundation for new PRSP priorities.
35.
WB staff should be commended for their efforts to pursue challenging work in an
uncertain context; but, given the quasi fragile-state nature of Mauritania and requirements
of re-engagement, the Bank could have paid more attention to staffing continuity,
overlapping and experience.47 The Bank’s Mauritania Country Office had improved
portfolio management by developing a systematized portfolio monitoring system
accessible to the government and partners. Its quality had gradually increased; however
supervisory quality did not return uniformly to pre-2008 levels: For example,
restructuring of all projects needing it did not proceed after 2009 as rapidly as was
required and, in a few cases, did not occur and indicators were not changed. M&E
remained weak in various operations and the need for better monitoring was stressed in
the 2011 CPPR. There has been also high turn-over of Mauritian staff, and in some
cases, the lack of continuity (sometimes with a time gap in supervision missions) led to a
loss of institutional memory, decreased quality of dialogue with counterparts and
partners, and contributed to slow project implementation.
Lessons Learned and Suggestions for a New CAS
36.
A first lesson relates to the impact of the political events and disruptions to the
CAS. Some programs/operations were less affected than others, particularly those
launched at the start of the previous CAS, where strong capacity was built in the PIUs
and counterparts were familiar with the Bank. Also, WB teams remained stable and the
government commitment has been genuine, 48 based on a full agreement with the Bank on
long-term objectives.
37.
The importance of long-term WB involvement in specific areas was again
confirmed. Such efforts over two-three CAS periods ensured stable support by the Bank,
reinforced government commitment and incentives for changes. A long-lasting
development impact is then possible, e.g. in the extractive industries, urban development
45

Mauritania’s low CPIA (evolving between 3.2 in 2005 and 3.3 in 2008) remained a restraining factor.
According to the latest (3rd) review of the program conducted in October 2011 progress appears satisfactory.
47
This was observed by counterparts and donors. The difference can be seen with projects where staff continuity
was maintained, as re-engagement went smoothly and implementation resumed faster.
48
Such as privatization.
46

53

and CDDs, PFM and procurement reform, and primary education. This argues for the
WB to (a) pursue its engagement in areas where much remains to be done (particularly in
long-term reform and capacity building); and (b) re-engage in sectors it left too soon (as
in the water sector). As the Bank is often seen as an “honest broker,” many donors are
more willing to engage in a sector when the Bank is involved and it also increases
leverage for change.
38.
A second lesson is the pervasive problem of weak capacity in Mauritania’s
administration, 49 e.g. due to the regular, rapid turnover of high officials and other staff,
compounded by political events. This reduces institutional memory and the possibility of
building of a modern administration, and raises sustainability issues. Strong capacity
building is a must in all operations and needs to be sustained over an extended period.
39.
However, capacity building in individual operations is not sufficient. Rather,
long-term reform and modernization of Mauritania’s administration is needed, not only to
increase absorptive capacity and efficiency, but also to produce good governance,
transparency, inclusive development and public confidence in the government—and thus,
political stability. PFM and administration HR management, capacity building in
extractive industries with the WB project have been steps in the right direction. A GAC
program will also help, but a comprehensive and phased public program to modernize the
administration needs to be elaborated with support from the Bank.
40.
A third lesson is that although some operations (particularly the new ones) were
constrained by the limited IDA funds (particularly stand-alone TA projects), their impact
is significant. Mauritania’s domestic resources are growing, and the government is
increasingly interested in WB participation as source of knowledge, bringing experience
that other donors do not have and helping leverage more financing from other sources.
However, this can only work if (a) the areas of intervention are those where the Bank has
a comparative advantage in knowledge and experience, and (b) there are experienced
core staff to whom Bank teams can transfer their information.
41.
Where countries, such as Mauritania, are emerging from a period of disruption
with high turnover in the administration, the Bank should pay particular attention to have
stable local staff 50 and to keep experienced international staff engaged in operations for
extended periods. Staffing issues have now become more difficult for all donors because
of (a) two episodes of political turmoil since 2005, (b) security problems, and (c) the
perception that conditions are more difficult and offer lower prospects for achieving fast
tangible results, particularly with smaller and less visible projects than in other countries.
42.
For the new CAS, a comprehensive analysis of the political economy of change is
essential, given the fragile and volatile context, in order to appreciate risks/obstacles and
design a realistic CAS with appropriate risk-mitigation approaches. Also, political and
other risks should not prevent the WB from designing a program that includes new and

49
50

There were a few exceptions, such as the Ministry of Finance.
Eg., the high turnover of local economists since 2005 has made economic analysis and dialogue more difficult..

54

bold initiatives—as long as their selection and design take into account the specifics of
Mauritania’s environment.
43.
The country is at a turning point, presenting opportunities for change but also
some risks. Because the booming mining sector is generating increased government
revenues, the WB should focus on the issues of governance, management and use of
public expenditures. With the huge investments needed in infrastructure, the government
could be tempted to devote huge efforts and increased revenues to projects that bring
quick, visible results, and to poorly targeted (but visible) subsidies, at the expense of
more long-term investments in capacity building, human development, and reforms,
particularly those linked to sustainable job creation. Thus, a balanced approach is needed
to address immediate problems in ways that can achieve quick results but also maintain a
long-term focus on capacity building and reforms that can reduce vulnerability and spur
sustainable job creation.
44.
The Bank should pursue this approach in the next CAS with various operations
plus AAAs. Regarding projects, a good mix could include: (a) operations that scale up
those implemented during the last two CAS periods (those with limited risks and
substantial rewards), and (b) a few high-risk pilots, with possibly high, long-term rewards
and demonstration effects.
45.
The development challenges identified in the 2007 CAS, cross-sector challenges
remain essentially the same. Some are even more acute now, while others were not
sufficiently addressed in the PRSP: e.g. employment generation, inclusiveness, climate
change, regional integration, vulnerability and safety nets, statistical and M&E capacity.
New challenges regarding oversight, governance and fiscal drain problems have emerged
given the large public enterprise (PE) sector. 51
46.
In the next CPS, the WB activities should attempt to boost sustained, inclusive
economic growth and employment generation, address severe poverty, reduce
vulnerability to climate change and other external shocks, diversify the economy,
enhance good governance (including natural resources, PFM and governance of PEs) and
rebuild statistical and M&E capabilities.
47.
The last two CASs focused on rural development and agriculture in the project
portfolio. While the CDD approach scaled–up in the PDRC helped bring the population
out of the rural poverty trap, irrigation projects in the Senegal valley have been
disappointing. Over the last 20 years, the WB, other donors and government have
generally failed to modernize and develop sustainable agriculture in this area, where
production could increase (but poverty is acute and the risk of social and political
tensions are high). These problems must be addressed in the fight against poverty—even
51

This placed Mauritania back to its 1984 situation before a PE reform & scaling down program was
launched.

55

more now, with Mauritania’s food crisis. But a new approach should be based on
transparent, inclusive agricultural strategies that involve a renewed irrigation policy and
land tenure. This will be built in the new proposed agriculture operation under the
upcoming CPS.
48.
The environment has historically not been high on the government agenda. The
WB played a key role in deepening the dialogue in this area and building (with the
PRECASP) a Ministry of Environment. This engagement will be pursued under the
upcoming CPS, stressing how climate change will affect Mauritania’s agriculture and
non-mineral natural resources, and work to prevent those effects (e.g. the risk of
catastrophic flooding of Nouakchott).

Other Developments
• Under EI-TAF Bank is helping prepare natural gas-to-power PPP and will
provide assistance in future project transaction.
• On fisheries, ESW and expanded dialogue have led to proposal for new twin
track approach with GEF/IDA on sector governance reform and port
infrastructure to increase local added value in fisheries (FY13). It would
combine IBRD enclave funds for infrastructure and GEF grants via the West
Africa Regional Fisheries Program. The Government recognizes clearly the
Bank’s comparative advantage in the sector, with its regional and worldwide
experience and as a neutral broker.

Annex 4 : Country Partnership Strategy Donor Positioning
Cooperation with development partners has been close in recent years and will continue during
the CPS period. An Annex Positioning of Donors will be included in the document. There are
many synergies between donors’ interventions and World Bank Group assistance. So, the Bank
teams will continue to work with bilateral donors, UN system, Arab Funds, the Islamic
Development Bank, GIZ, African Development Bank, AfD, the EU and others. The focus will be
on increased upstream collaboration on strategies, shared analytic work, and effective cofinancing. The Bank will also continue to collaborate closely with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), which conducts regular monitoring missions, and increasingly with the International
Finance Corporation (IFC).
Moreover the Paris declaration recommended regular meetings between Government and
development partners, sector-wide programs, and joint analytical work. Looking ahead, the
focus will be placed on more upstream collaboration on assistance strategies with bilateral
donors, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the EU, and the United Nations (UN) system,
greater harmonization of procedures, carrying out joint analytic work in key areas of poverty,
decentralization, building public sector and governance, and the use of sector-wide programs in
education and health.
Finally, Bank Group upstream support to remove selected constraints to private sector
development will complement others donors’ direct support to investments and to private
companies.
The CPS, prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, will be complemented by a
renewed effort on donor coordination through: (i) sharing information on sector strategies, with
joint funding of programs and projects; (ii) providing feedback on implementation and generic
portfolio issues for ongoing operations; and (iii) undertaking joint coordinated efforts in
communicating with the Government and other stakeholders. These was a strong consensus on
development challenges and priorities among various stakeholder groups, while it was
commonly agreed that actual implementation of policies, programs, and projects will determine
how successfully they will be met.

Annex 6: Country Partnership Strategy Consultations - Feedback Summary
Date: 25–27 September, 2012
Venue: Nouakchott, Mauritania
Session: Country Partnership Consultations (CPS)
Participants: Civil Society & Religious Leaders, Private Sector, Parliamentarians, Donors and the
Government
Number of Participants: 60

Specific Feedback from Stakeholders

Civil Society & Religious Leaders (25 September, 2012)
•

•
•
•
•
•

•

•

Participants repeatedly point towards the importance of taking the country context
into account, i.e. 100percent Muslim country. There is a need to sensitive donor
community intervening in Mauritania. Bank needs to redefine its strategy to see what
the priorities of the people are. Need to know where to start and this should be at the
needs of the people: access to education, health, reinforces capacities of citizens to
give them a voice.
HIV/Aids: Bank should integrate Aids into their development strategy
Education: key sector for development, there have not been fundamental changes or
progress, quality has not improved. There is a need to be more consultative and ask
what the population wants from the education system.
Reform of the banking system: this is essential because there is not distribution of
resources and credits.
Need to reinforce capacities of NGOs and civil society (CS). CS remains vulnerable.
With reference to Pillars 1 and 2 the question is posed why irrigation and food safety
are divided – they should be treated together. Lots of people do not benefit from the
Bank projects (refers to the client survey) thus there is a need to reinforce capacity of
CS and do diligent M&E of Bank funds.
Social protection: is seen as extremely important but no clear strategy of Bank
intervention can be seen from proposed CPS. It would be important for the Bank to
coordinate public services since not even 7percent of the population is covered by
these services. Also important that the Bank intervenes at the policy level of service
provision.
Governance and corruption: the main problem is that there are no mechanisms of
justice to deal with corruption although these are badly needed. Decisions taken by
the government at not implemented. What role can the Bank play here? Which
actions could Bank do to ensure that these are implemented and actually realized?
Need to turn words into action. Put in place systems to see that those who do not
79

•
•
•

•

•

•

•

•

manage finances well will be prosecuted. Huge problem due to lack of transparency
and marginalization enforced by the government.
Dividing state resources: a lot could be done with state resources if they were
distributed correctly and the Bank should help doing this.
Community Driven Development (CDD): all interventions of the Bank should be
based on this approach. Need to take local actors into consideration and to give more
capacity to the population.
Land: main problem is food security – during drought everyone thinks about saving
the starving but there is a need to make better use of land resources. There is land
which is not being exploited but then international actors come in and exploit it. A
huge part of the Mauritanian population does not have access to land. Bank needs to
intervene for better distribution of land. Need to help against expropriation and land
grab which comes from big industries in order to avoid that people lose their
livelihoods and starve. The Bank has the responsibility to take land into
consideration.
Stability and security: this needs to be the basis of all development activities.
Imams have an important role in working against violence and supporting stability
and security. Great cooperation between Imams and the government but this is not
enough to ensure stability and security.
Monitoring & Evaluation: there seems to be general concern that M&E of Bank
projects is not diligent enough. Recommendation is to be better aware of effects and
outcomes of Bank projects, e.g. food security: has the Bank through its projects tried
to evaluate the effect of their actions? Over 700,000 people are suffering from the
drought today. In the system of control of the Bank there is a need to insist that
monitoring happens, even with the government.
Social justice and human rights: add a pillar on social justice and rights – to touch
upon discrimination which is very apparent in the country. High levels of
discrimination and here we could also add gender which is an essential question.
52percent of the population is female and this is not being taken into account.
Coming close to presidential elections it is essential to include female candidates.
Youth: 70percent of the population is considered youth. Need to include youth
employment in the fight against poverty – this is a fundamental issue. We always
remain in old structures. Training is important – very important to know what youth
want and does not want. Important question to ask is why are things not improving?
Very important to include youth in different sectors of development.
Project execution: needs to be more efficient – lack of efficiency is one of the main
problems. Projects enhance corruption and favoritism and it would be important to
include citizens.

Security, stability, youth employment and education – these should be the 4 main areas
of intervention of the Bank. Without these nothing can be done. You have to change the
paradigm. Look at justice and governance. Education, land and better engagement with
CS. We cannot do development without security and CDD is necessary for better impact.

We know better the partners of the UN than the Bank – the organizations that
intervene directly. The bank intervenes at higher level, at the macro level hence it is
not known so well. Here Bank can take the lesson how to intervene in more sensitive
domains in order for the Bank to be known better.
Natural resources: there is a need to look at the given conditions of budget troubles
of the country.
Basic Services: huge concentration of population in urban areas but still many don’t
have access to water, sanitation, etc lots of people who are neither francophone, nor
speak Arabic – we need to reflect on this level of education. Need to balance the level
of wealth within the country and here the Bank could support.
Stability: Potential of a political crisis also needs to be taken into account. Necessary
to create a stabile context, also in political terms.
Bank interventions: Reports do not have a vision - direct impact on the population is
best achieved via projects.
Finances: Need to facilitate access to finances for investors and enterprises. This
problem of finances should be addressed.
Bank should accompany decentralization efforts.

Resume: Bank is very relevant in Mauritania, especially in the education sector. Health: it
had been mentioned many times that the Bank should continue its effort in projects on
Aids. Social services are very important. Need for better communication with stakeholders
on the ground. Take the context of the country into account. Strategy of the Bank is in line
with its mission.

Private Sector (26 September, 2012)
•
•
•
•
•

•

Activation of the Committee National de concertation de secteur privé – this is
their main objective. To put this in place will allow them to deal with numerous
problems – transversal and sectorial, for example when creating businesses
Problem of energy costs, liquidity, infrastructure, lack of educated professionals.
Here we need to address the education system.
Need for protection of infant industries from competition. National industry has a
socio-economic impact. Necessary to create commercial activities.
Mining industry: exportation of mining products is important but there is a need for
donor coordination.
Training: both administrative and professional. It is important for the administration
to understand the consequences of their decisions – if the decision makers at the level
of the administration do not take good decisions this is a big problem. Need for them
to understand economic principles, modern business law, etc.
Great need for human resources to be good in order for the public and private sector
can function. CPS should focus on HR as this is one of the biggest problems of
Mauritania. Capacity building on HR can be done by a program of training of
81

•

•

•
•
•
•

•

procedures of eg marketing, new IT technologies, etc. This willingness to promote
HR is essential
Federation of Fisheries: around 40,000 employees – more than in the mining sector.
Problems of commercialization – it is the state that commercializes which is a
handicap for the sector because the sector could create much higher employment if it
were better managed like in Senegal for example. It is important that this sector
develops and need to avoid that it will be taken over by foreign companies.
Agriculture: Need to see this sector as strategic since it will address all the sociopolitical problems of this country hence there is a need for particular attention. Need
for “credit agricole” – this exists already and Bank has played a vital role but the
sector is still mainly traditional hence there is a need to revise this. Problem of debt:
system credits has been put in place but real problem of natural disasters (drought,
flood, locust) and every time this happens then there is not enough agricultural
products and hence loans can never be paid back which creates a spiral of higher and
higher debt levels.
Capacity building is a transversal problem that needs to be addressed in all sectors.
Transport: problem of good roads – some are good but a lot are not. Cost of
constructing roads does not compare to cost of transport. Put in place credits to
improve situation.
Problem of good governance: social responsibility needs to be enforced. Need for
business to respect fiscal, administrative and social responsibility. And fiscal
transparency and ensure that enterprises pay taxes.
Phenomenon of informal sector – this has a huge social impact but it is important
that we understand this phenomenon – what is at the origin of it? It is the cost of
money and other difficulties. To solve this find measures that will encourage the
move from informal to formal sector.
Energy and transformation of agriculture: Don’t put too much resources on soft
(TA and ESW) but more on hard – real projects.

Donors (26 September, 2012)
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

More emphasis on partnership.
Health: WB did good interventions in the health sector which were important and we
should go back to supporting this sector. Add WASH along with nutrition.
Add social protection to Pillar 2. We should put accent here – we should put in place
a framework for protection because MR is structurally vulnerable to different external
shock (climate, security, etc). Important that the most vulnerable part of the
population is being protected. This is important for economic growth. Also add
environmental protection.
Importance of youth employment – but unclear to some what we mean when talking
about youth employment. AfDB is doing a study on youth employment which will be
available in 2013 and would be a good point of cooperation.
Professional training:
Security and stability of the sub-region:
Besides following PRSP we also have the responsibility to choose pillars that are
more realistic and achievable. Now we are following very generally the PRSP but to
82

•
•
•
•

•

be effective we really need to be more specific. Pillars looks good but we should be a
little more selective regarding the project and activities. We should be a little more
selective.
M&E and providing country with statistics is very important – need a more strategic
framework for M&E. Lack of statistics if a huge problem for all sectors in MR.
Put emphasis on the axis of resilience and vulnerability. Disaster risk management
is also a great problem in MR and we should take this upon us and appreciate when
we do our work.
Coordination: Community of partners is not big in MR and we all intervene more or
less in the same domain. At the UN they are discussing a strategy of resilience for
the Sahel – need to make sure to coordinate.
IMF: Put one pillar on inclusive growth and employment: promote investment (by
developing the private sector) and social protection. We need to focus on agricultural
and fisheries growth. It would be good to include the CPIA – what has been done for
stabilization, etc. Add a few analytical studies on employment etc. How to deal with
liberalization of products?
Reform the government and the public sector would be the most important.

Government (27 September, 2012)
•
•

•

Highlights importance of statistics – real need for data
Importance of the transport sector – here it would be good to know what Bank
envisions
Very interested in youth employment
Importance of capacity building of administration
Would be good to have something on infrastructure
Civil protection would be extremely important but this cannot be found in Bank
strategy
One suggestion: interventions should be divided in three specific activities: fisheries,
agriculture and capacity building. What we propose is too disbursed.
Health sector – disappointed not to see anything here – Bank has signed the compact
until 2015 to support health. Is also disappointed about MAP (Aids project). Bank
should again take this up.
Min of Economic Affairs argues that there already is a quite a lot allocated to
agriculture and does not want it to be divided just by three sectors. He thinks the
distribution is already quite good, because a lot of activities are already related to the
other sectors.
Min of Finance lobbies for budget support.

Annex 7: Political & Social Analysis
Mauritania’s development trajectory is closely linked to its historical and political alliances. Five
overarching themes characterize the landscape and constitute the main sources of fragility and
conflict: (i) Polarization around cultural identity and social relations built around clans and
families have impeded social inclusion and cohesion; (ii) History of coups, lack of
transparent decision-making and influence of traditional elite weakens institutions and
local governance; (iii) absence of property rights, Land distribution and management is a
source of conflict and tension; (iv) Rapid urbanization has increased perception of
inequalities, affecting urban youth in particular; and (v) Regional dimensions.
1.) Polarization around cultural identity and social relations built around clans and
families have impeded social inclusion and cohesion
•

•

Strong divide between ethnic groups, clans and casts
 Traditionally very divided society around rigid group boundaries defined by ethnicity,
clans and casts
 In large part, inter- and intra-ethnic/tribal cast system still determines social order
Access to power builds around ethnic structure, clans and families
 Reproduction of social structures through control of politics, economics and the
military by leaders from traditional ruling clans and families within ethnic groups
 Tendency is reinforced by a rent economy, concentrated on very few sectors that is
easily captured by a very small political and economic elite
 Societal dynamics reinforces exclusion and exclusionary policies
 Political and economic patronage, forced displacement, quasi slavery situation,
language of education, conflicts over land etc.

2.) History of coups, lack of transparent decision-making and influence of traditional elite
weakens institutions and local governance
•

•

Traditional social structures permeate State and local institutions
 Strong traditional system determines how many formal institutions operate
 Regular interference of army and heads of powerful clans and families in politics
weakens function of State
 Informal norms permeates formal justice system which weakens judiciary
independence
Problem of governance, especially at local level
 Tight control by a few central organizations and the military on state and local level
institutions undermines decentralization
 Large parts of the territory with very low population density experience loose state
control which increasing penetration by illegal groups
 Attempts to control rents from extractive industries and a few other sectors
undermines governance

3.) Land distribution and management is a source of conflict and tension
•

Issues around land in the Senegal River Basin reflect social injustice and inequalities of
society
84

•

•

 Characterized by scarcity, ethnic rivalries, corruption and non-transparent decisionmaking by government
 Conflicts over land categorized as: (i) intra-tribal (often between Haratin and Bidhan);
(ii) inter-ethnic (often between Halpulaar and Haratin); (iii) between traditional
chieftaincies (e.g. Halpulaar and Wolof); economically motivated (farmers vs
agribusiness); and (v) between pastoralists and agriculturalists
Serious problem with reintegration of returnees
 Land allocated to returnees is not sufficient and of low quality
 Lack of access to formal justice mechanisms and redress mechanisms
 Very strong sense of social injustice
Conflicts are latent with serious threat to social cohesion and peace
 Many conflicts created as a result of decisions taken by government, that is top down
and does not consult enough

4.) Rapid urbanization has increased perception of inequalities, affecting urban youth in
particular
•

•

Creation of spatial, ethnic and social divide:
 Ethnic division of urban districts which determines social identity
 Creation of spatial inequality, trend towards ghettoization
Lack of attention to needs of urban youth
 Lack of purpose, sense of marginalization
 Very little urban planning and social policy to address problems of youth

5.) Regional Dimensions
•

•

Rapid development of trafficking and illegal activities through the Sahara
 Trafficking in drug, humans and weapon
 Reinforced by a number of conflicts in the border regions of the Sahara (Algeria,
Libya, Touareg rebellion, Boko Haram in Nigeria)
Situation in Mali
 Pressure on local population due to inflow of refugees coupled with drought
 Pressure on livelihoods
 Strengthening of terrorist groups such as AQMI who are gaining territorial control

Annex 8: Gender in Mauritania
The Government of Mauritania is committed to promoting gender equality and empowering
women by eliminating gender disparities in several areas. The Diagnostic made with Bank
support during the last CAS and currently with UN agencies, shows that some obstacles persist
in term of equity. Gender issues are still confronted by cultural, social and economic barriers and
with weak use of human rights’ approach to respond to the strategic and practical needs of
women and men.
The GOM has ratified most international juridical instruments relating to women and has set up
an institutional framework to maintain the fundamental humans’ rights of women (Personal
status code). The political commitment has led to some improvements in term of human
development and fight against Female Genital Mutilation.
Even though progress has been made, inequity exists in term of human development, access to
productive resources, labor market, etc. However, most of the existing sectoral policies have a
focus on gender issues, in order to contribute to the reduction of gender disparities and poverty
among women.
Promote equal access for men/women to human capital development: Regarding girls'
education, Mauritania has registered significant improvement in the gross enrollment rate in
basic education. The gross enrollment rate (GER) of girls (105 percent) in primary education,
now exceeds boys (95.4 percent). However, significant gender gaps still remain at the secondary
level. According to recent studies done by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, women are lagging
behind with a 72.2 percent illiteracy rate compared to 44 percent for men. The government
continues to prioritize the issue of illiteracy and has adopted an illiteracy elimination strategy
which places particular emphasis on women and the reduction of gender inequalities in
education.
In the health sector, the most serious health issue for women in Mauritania is the high Maternal
Mortality Rate (MMR) (560 per 100,000 live births in 2010). The lack of access to health
facilities and frequent and insufficiently spaced births are among the main contributors to the
high MMR in the country. While 75 percent of women receive antenatal care from a skilled
health professional, the percentage of births attended by a skilled health attendant is much lower.
The GOM is putting a lot of emphasis on reaching the health MDGs; A National Entity for
reaching health MDG has been set up to allow a follow up of health indicators. This is a critical
area of concern for Mauritania and represents one of the MDGs for which the government is
particularly off-target.
In terms of employment and economic participation of women, the National Strategy for
Institutionalizing Gender (SNIG) notes that female employment is low since it concerns only
12.4percent of the economically active women against (27.3 percent of men in the same
category). Women are concentrated in agriculture (48.6 percent of women in this category) and,
to a lesser extent, in administration (23.6percent against 76.4percent for men) and trade
(31.6percent against 63.9 for men). On the labor market, the SNIG highlights that women
continue to suffer marginalization.
86

Women (29 percent) often have less access than men (71 percent) to decent employment and
labor standards. In the private sector, the situation is much worse, and Mauritania only has
7.9percent women in the private sector against 92.1 percent of men. In the private sector most
requested profiles are specialists in building, electrical, welding, masonry, auto mechanics, etc.
Women with these specialties are almost nonexistent in Mauritania.
Promote equal access for men/women to productive and economic Resources: The place of
women in the national economy does not reflect the demographic weight of this social group, or
its potential contribution or induced effects. Mauritanian women’s opportunities to contribute to
and benefit from productive participation in the workforce appear to be limited compared with
those of men. Even if the Economic contribution of women is increasing and becoming visible,
some constraints are limiting their access to productive resources: access to land tenure for rural
women, financial and technical resources and market. Informal sector is the largest source of
employment for women.
The female situation in the labor market is characterized by the fact that certain activities are
significantly less open to women. This is particularly the case of employees who work in
industry, justice, administration, etc. The National gender Strategy prepared by the GOM in 2010
and updated in 2012, put emphasis on Agriculture as representing the most important sector for
women’s economic participation. Over 48.6 percent of women are estimated to work in
agriculture, with almost 75 percent of self-employed rural women working in agriculture-related
activities (Gender Strategy, 2010).
Moreover, women’s representation compared to men is much higher in the agricultural sector
than in the economy as a whole. Women are estimated to represent around 54 percent of those
economically active in the sector (FAO, 2011). The potential of the agriculture sector to help
rural women out of poverty is hampered by poor productivity (partly resulting from women’s
poor access to productive inputs), sex-specialization that results in men dominating the more
profitable activities, and lower access to credit and land(property) which is very unequal between
men and women in Mauritania.
Various strategies and policies developed by the Mauritanian Government clearly state the need
to increase and strengthen the economic activities of women. The operationalization of the
concept “promotion of women's economic activities", constitute an institutional response to the
needs of women. During the preparation of the PRSP 2013-2015, some objectives have been
identified for the promotion of women’s access to: i) the productive factors (land, financial
resources, human resources, etc.), ii) access to the labor market, and iii) enhancing the
productivity of women. The strategic options for the development of micro-finance institutions
offering to women cooperatives financial services is an opportunity to develop economic
activities and to meet a real need in particular for women who do not have access to the banking
system. The establishment of IMF savings and credit institutions, managed and operated by
women themselves, has had an impact beyond considerations of access to credit, they have also
contributed to strengthening the social capital of women and their ability to participate and
support their access to economic development.
Some concrete actions are under consideration by the GOM: i) allocating more resources to the
MASEF to help the Department to set up the keys priorities for women’s economic promotion
(improvement of illiteracy, access to land, developing more financial intermediation, etc.), ii)
87

putting in place and promoting the private sector development which may include a subcomponent on female entrepreneurship.
c) Give men and women equal status and protection under the law.
Mauritania has made progress in achieving greater legal equality for women, but implementation
is often poor and some legal discrimination still exists. A new constitution, which guarantees
equal rights for men and women, was passed in 2006 (World Bank, 2007). Mauritania has also
ratified numerous international and regional legal texts such as the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (World Bank, 2007). Mauritanian
law calls for equal pay for equal work. This law is observed by the two largest employers in the
country – the civil service and the state mining company (USDS, 2011). However, in practice,
women still suffer discrimination due to poor implementation and persistent negative social
attitudes and practices (USDS, 2011).
Some progress has also been made with respect to law enforcement, prevention and response to
gender-based violence. The Personal Status Code (CSP), which was enacted in 2001, raises the
marital age for men and women to 18 years and makes the consent of the woman mandatory.
Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is still very common in Mauritania but is decreasing and there
is growing social momentum in attitudes against the practice. Between 2001 and 2007, FGM
incidence fell from 71 percent to 65 percent, mainly due to a reduced incidence in urban areas
(USDS, 2011). Support for the practice among the population is also decreasing, with 64 percent
of women and 70 percent of men now favoring the abolition of FGM (World Bank, 2007). A
law criminalizing the FGM is under preparation.
Women’s equality is also hampered by some continuing areas of explicit legal inequality in
modern civil law. Discrimination against women was seen with respect to the right to present
witnesses and evidence and the right of access to government-held evidence (USDS, 2011).
Women are considered minors before the law, cannot confer citizenship on their children if the
father is a non-national (which is not the case for men), and do not have equal inheritance rights,
with daughters entitled to only half the inheritance of sons and widows entitled to less than
widowers (OECD, n.d.). The CSP also gives the husband exclusive authority over the family and
allows the husband unilateral discretion to divorce, while it refers women’s requests for divorce
to a judge (GoM, 2008).
The government has been leading the way on women’s representation in public life, introducing
a quota system in July 2006 that requires women to make up at least 20 percent of legislative
candidates (USDS, 2011). This has resulted in women having a slightly higher level of
representation in parliament. According to 2011 WDI data, the proportion of seats held by
women in parliament was 22 percent. In addition, women hold around 35 percent of municipal
council seats and have recently been appointed to symbolically important positions, such as
‘Wali’ (GoM, 2008; 2011). However, women’s representation is lower in other political
institutions. In 2010, women made up only around 16 percent of the seats in the Senate and 18
percent of cabinet members. Women are also largely absent from senior positions in the public
sector.

Annex 9: Mauritanian Statistics and World Bank support
The Mauritanian Office for National Statistics (ONS) was established in 1990 and is a financially
autonomous agency, supervised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development
(MAED). The ONS’s main mission is to collect, process, analyze, and disseminate statistical
information, as well as to coordinate the National Statistical System (NSS). Its mission also
includes: monitoring the economic framework, conducting research, developing cooperation
(domestic and international) and facilitating training activities in the field of statistics. This
agency, together with specialized statistical services located in various Ministries (established in
the areas of education, health, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries) shape the NSS. Assessing the
impact of these services may be complex since their production of statistical data is not always
widely disseminated.
Mauritania adopted a National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS) in 2000,
covering the period 2001-2012. This strategy has recently been updated and extended, thus
covering the period 2011-2015. The main four pillars are: (1) Improving the organizational
system of national statistics, and strengthening data collection and coordination, (2) Developing
statistical production by improving data quality and its dissemination, (3) Stimulating data
analysis, and (4) Developing human capacity, as well as advocating/promoting the availability of
technological and financial resources.
The binding constraint for statistical development in Mauritania is the implementation of the
existing Strategy through annual action plans. The principal bottlenecks hindering statistical
development in the country are common to many statistical systems throughout Africa, namely:
a. The need for statistical improvement is not adequately entrenched in the national culture
and among decision makers, and the governance implications are not sufficiently
understood;
b. The scarcity of qualified human resources and the weakness of the education system,
which is unable to fully respond to the needs of the NSS, the private sector and the
international institutions;
c. The absence of a culture conducive to wide data dissemination and the very difficult
access to existing statistical figures;
d. The consolidation of statistical administrative record systems within the various
ministerial departments remains weak, particularly in the areas of water, sanitation, rural
development and environment.
Against this background, and with a view to improve the measurability of progress toward the
World Bank Group (WBG) twin goals of reducing absolute poverty and enhancing shared
prosperity, the WBG aims at supporting the Government of Mauritania strengthening the
availability and reliability of its statistical data, by leveraging on the following instruments:
a. Technical and financial support to the Population census and to the forthcoming
Household Survey, through the PRECASP statistical component. The support has already
materialized and will be directed to data collection and data processing, as well as to
sample frame design.
b. The implementation of a Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB),
equivalent to USD450’000. The main objective of the TFSCB Grant will be to support
the implementation of the NSDS 2011-2015 especially by improving the efficiency of the
NSS and the quality and coverage of specific statistics.
c. The World Bank will also provide technical comments and support on the questionnaire of
the forthcoming Household Survey by proposing methodological approaches.
