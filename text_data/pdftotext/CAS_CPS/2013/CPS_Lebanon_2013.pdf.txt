PROGRESS REPORT - COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (FY11-FY14)
LEBANESE REPUBLIC
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Progress Report assesses the implementation of the World Bank Group's (WBG)
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Lebanon for FY11-FY14. Preparations for the CPS
followed three years of political instability in Lebanon, in the aftermath of the Israel-Lebanon
hostilities in 2006. The hostilities instigated a deep political divide which paralyzed Parliament and
the Government and increased political violence. After the Doha Accord in 2008, and the formation
of a National Unity Government in November 2009, a period of political stability paved the way for a
renewed focus on the critical reforms to improve Lebanon's fiscal and debt sustainability, create
employment, provide adequate infrastructure and social services, and support social inclusion.
2.
The CPS discussions, which began with the Government in early 2010, were aimed at
putting the economy on a path to sustained broad-based economic growth, by focusing on four
strategic goals over a period of four years: (i) Growth and Fiscal Sustainability; (ii) Competitive
Business Environment; (iii) Economic Infrastructure (electricity, water, transport, environment and
waste management, local development); and (iv) Human Capital Development and Social Protection.
3.
The CPS envisaged a program of investment lending, as well as analytical and advisory
services (AAA) through the existing portfolio complemented by new lending ranging between
US$375 and US$550 million. This program is supported by investments and advisory services
provided by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The CPS is anchored in the country's
sectarian and consensus-based political reality, which makes it hard to pursue ambitious reforms.
4.
The CPS envisaged a two-tiered approach: (i) a Core Program of engagement consisting
of the existing portfolio, selected new investments in basic services, as well as technical assistance
and analytical work to inform and build momentum around key reforms (Tier I); and (ii) a deeper
engagement in additional areas where traction for reform would develop, including budget support
should Lebanon implement a sound macroeconomic framework and introduce a robust reform
program positively impacting the fiscal situation (Tier II). Progress on implementation of the Core
Program would be assessed regularly, with the Government of Lebanon (GoL) and the Bank Group
agreeing on areas for possible scale-up of WBG engagement.
5.
The difficult country context and the political and economic impact of exogenous shocks
instigated by the spillover of the Arab Spring, especially the uprising in neighboring Syria,
have strongly affected Lebanon. The influx of Syrian refugees has had not only a humanitarian
dimension but also developmental consequences. To date, there are 427,000 people registered as
refugees or awaiting registration with UNHCR (up from 120,000 in November 2012) with many
more not registered. It is expected that the number will continue to grow and possibly reach one
million by year end. This displacement is putting a strain on hosting communities that already face
challenges in terms of service delivery and poverty levels. The turmoil in Syria is also affecting the
Lebanese economy more generally, both in terms of increased risk premia vis-A-vis private sector
investment and blocked trade routes.
6.
A total of US$297 million in new IBRD commitments have been made since the start of
CPS implementation in the areas of water, education, cultural heritage and SME financing (see
Table 3). In addition, the Social Protection and Promotion Project (US$30 million), and the Mobile
1

Internet Ecosystem Project (US$6.4 million) are envisaged to be presented for Board approval before
the end of FY13. IFC has committed around US$680 million between FY11 and FY13 in a
combination of loans, guarantees and equity investments in banking, microfinance, insurance and
Information and Communication Technology (ICT). In addition, IFC has provided a range of
advisory services to: (i) scale up Sustainable Energy Finance; (ii) increase access to finance for
SMEs (with a particular focus on women-owned SMEs); (iii) develop the "ARZ" green building
rating system; and (iv) conduct a series of green building assessments.
7.
Progress on structural economic reforms, however, has not been achieved. This is due to
the continuous political tensions, which culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Najib Mikati
on March 22, 2013. Mikati had formed his Government in June 2011 after five months of difficult
consultations. The current Government has assumed a caretaker role, until a new Cabinet is formed
by PM-designate Tammam Salam. Continuous political fragmentation has hindered the
Government's ability to reach consensus on economic reform and on addressing the country's
infrastructure deficiencies.
8.
A notable exception is the Energy Sector. The Government was able to start addressing the
sector's constraints and approved in June 2010 the Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector, which
establishes a road map for investments and reform. Although some progress has been made, broader
sector reforms remain at risk due to potential lack of public financing and difficulties inherent to
Lebanon's political economy.
The strategic thrust of the CPS and two-tiered approach remains relevant. However, the
9.
heightened risks and their impact on the country program since the discussion of the CPS in 2010
requires a revision of the more ambitious goals. Economic and social vulnerabilities, as well as
internal and regional risks identified during CPS preparation have substantially increased. With the
emergence of the Arab Spring and increased regional instability, the Bank Group's assistance
program has been characterized by a protracted period of uncertainty and political instability. As
such, scaling back of the strategic goals is warranted (Strategic Goal 1 has been recast as:
StrengthenedFiscal and Public FinancialManagement; and Goal 2 has been narrowed to: Improved
Competiveness).
10.
Nonetheless, progress has been made towards achieving CPS milestones and outcomes.
Reforms in certain sectors have progressed, albeit timidly, and a number of the indicators under the
four pillars have been met or are on track to be met. The Results Matrix presented in Annex 1 has
been revised to reflect more realistic, gender-sensitive and measurable targets by ensuring alignment
with the country's program for the end of the CPS period. Going forward, new projects will
incorporate a systematic integration of gender issues.
11.
The Bank Group will continue to support the Government with lending for investments
in key economic infrastructure, as well as technical assistance and analytical work that will
inform and build momentum around key reforms. Complementing the existing program, stronger
focus will be placed on transformational sectors that show potential for progress under the present
circumstances, e.g. the electricity sector, with promising government and stakeholder consensus, the
water sector as per the priorities identified in the National Water Sector Strategy, and possibly
transport. The Bank will also continue to monitor the escalating Syrian crisis, and its socioeconomic,
fiscal and developmental ramifications, while evaluating the impact of this risk on the WBG
program.

II.

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

12.
The CPS strategic thrust remains relevant in light of the country's persisting
development challenges, which have been compounded by regional developments. The conflict
in neighboring Syria over the past two years has imposed a security, political, and economic toll on
Lebanon, fueling division along sectarian lines, and sparking repeated incidents of violence across
the country. These incidents have materially impacted the economy and diverted the Government's
attention from the envisaged reform process towards more immediate political and security concerns.
13.
Growth performance has remained below potential due to the country's
macroeconomic volatility, infrastructure bottlenecks, inadequate support to innovation,
distorted product and labor market regulations, and weak governance. The economy continues
to struggle to generate jobs necessary to absorb high unemployment and new entrants to the labor
force. Unemployment remains especially high among youth and women. The majority of the labor
force continues to be employed in low productivity service jobs and only 29 percent of workers are in
formal wage employment, i.e., with access to social security and protected by labor regulations.
The macro-fiscal framework remains fragile, posing challenges for medium-term growth
14.
Lebanon's growth spurt stopped in 2011, in part due to regional turmoil, domestic
political uncertainty and repeated security incidents. After growing by an average of 7.5 percent
in the four years through 2010, real GDP growth slowed to an estimated 3 percent in 2011 and to 1.4
percent in 2012 (Table 1). Key drivers of the slowdown were tourism, services, exports and
construction. Contingent on an improved political and security situation, a moderate rebound in
economic growth is projected for 2013 (to 2.3 percent). Key risks to the outlook are the uncertainties
linked to the June 2013 parliamentary elections, and spillovers from the Syrian civil war.
15.
Key structural reforms are required to overcome deep-rooted obstacles if higher
growth rates are to be achieved. Severe bottlenecks remain in infrastructure, especially in
electricity, transport and water, which will require significant levels of investment. Moreover,
economic volatility (including dependence on foreign financial inflows), inefficient public spending,
anticompetitive laws and practices, and low incentives to innovate need to be addressed not only to
improve growth and job creation, but also to facilitate necessary fiscal adjustment.
Maintaining a prudent approach to economic management in the midst of a volatile
16.
political and security environment remains critical. Lebanon's (large) financial sector is feeling
the effects of the Syrian crisis and regional uncertainties. High fiscal and current account deficits
increase exposure to shocks. Careful fiscal management is crucial, particularly in light of the
substantial exposure of commercial banks to sovereign risk.
The improvement in public finances was overturned in 2012, in part due to a structural
17.
increase in expenditure. From 2006 to 2012, public debt decreased by 47 percentage points of GDP,
primarily driven by record economic growth. During that period, the fiscal deficit shrank from 11.1
to 6.4 percent of GDP, mostly due to cyclical factors. 2012 marked a sharp reversal in fiscal
consolidation: the primary central government surplus shrank by 3.7 percentage points of GDP to a
deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP. Revenue performance weakened following the deceleration of the
economy while expenditure expanded briskly, mostly due to the cost of living adjustment for public
sector workers. Public debt remains high at 134.3 percent of GDP in 2012.
18.
Amid an accommodative monetary stance, money supply and lending to the private
sector remained buoyant. Money supply (M3) increased by 6.7 percent (yoy) in end-2012 thanks to
3

the continuous inflow of foreign deposits attracted by the wide LBP-USD spreads. Notwithstanding
rising sovereign credit risk, the dollarization rate of deposits remained stable. Lending to the private
sector grew broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. To further stimulate the economy, BdL
introduced a US$1.46 billion stimulus package providing discounted financing to the housing sector
and some innovative economic activities.

19.
Lebanon faces significant fiscal challenges going forward. Based on current policies, the
fiscal deficit is projected to remain elevated, at 8.9 percent of GDP in both 2012 and 2013. With
limited fiscal space, pressures on the expenditure side (e.g., increase in public sector wages) would
likely require a strengthened tax take. Revenue measures, however, have repeatedly stumbled due to
a lack of political and social consensus. If implemented without revenue offset, the proposed change
in the structure of salary scales could weaken the Lebanese economy through the return of
unsustainable debt dynamics, pressures on the peg, lower economic growth, and increased
unemployment. Reforming the public sector pension system would further reduce the negative
impact, but such reform cannot be separated from the need for strengthening social safety nets.
20.
The Syrian civil war exposed Lebanon's internal weaknesses and negatively impacted
economic growth. While the economy was already slowing down in 2011, the Syrian conflict
accelerated that movement. Private consumption dropped as precautionary saving rose due to
security concerns. Uncertain final demand and security concerns have also affected private
investment. Additionally, the political deadlock in the country, linked to the events in Syria, impeded
long awaited reforms to improve the business environment, tackle infrastructure bottlenecks, increase
4

competitiveness, and facilitate access to credit. Government consumption, however, slightly
increased as a direct result of the crisis due to spending on public services such as education, health,
and security. The Syrian crisis also put negative pressures on net exports.
21.
Lebanese banks have proved resilient to regional turbulence. Seven Lebanese banks are
currently operating in Syria. Their market share before the crisis was around 22 percent of total
Syrian deposits. Lebanese banks' assets in Syrian branches are estimated at US$2 billion and belong
to strong banks, which have adequate reserve coverage and therefore do not impose an unreasonable
added risk. These banks have increased their provisions to cover these losses. This will impact their
profitability in the short term. However, the medium-term outlook remains positive. Lebanese banks
are also impacted by the Cyprus banking crisis as their branches hold an estimated US$2.5 billion in
deposits. The impact is, however, seen as minor by markets with Lebanese banks' stock prices
largely unaffected by the surprise announcement of the tax on deposits.
The business environment is still in need of reform
22.
The Private Sector continues to suffer from the cost of transaction-based taxes
regulatory compliance and unfair competition. Corruption plays a significant role in the
application of taxes and regulations, public service connections, and public procurement. Although
corporate tax rates are not high, a variety of indirect taxes, duties and fees applied on transactions
impose a high cost on day-to-day business operations and discourage formality.
23.
A number of laws have been prepared and sent to Parliament where they remain
pending. Weak coordination among government agencies reduces the quality and impedes the
implementation of reforms at the national level. While decrees relating to company dispute
resolution, arbitration and mediation are in effect, laws on competition, procurement, e-Commerce,
and collateral as well as updates to the commercial code, trademark law and company law are
awaiting Parliamentary ratification. Preparations continue on the insurance, insolvency/bankruptcy,
construction and urban laws and on the commercial registry.
24.
Political instability continues to impede the development of efficient public-private
dialogue. When it exists, the public-private dialogue is personalized, informal and non-transparent.
Lack of coordination among civil society, universities, private sector and the diaspora hinders a
structured and comprehensive debate about economic and financial issues. While the Lebanese
private sector has some comparative advantages in the ICT sector, it has been unable to scale up for
lack of a well-structured public-private dialogue on strategic priorities.
Weak infrastructure services remain a major constraintfor economic growth
25.
Continued under-investment and the slow pace of reform have not improved the
perilous state of the Lebanese electricity sector. Public supply covers around 60 percent of
electricity demand, while technical and commercial losses exceed 30 percent of the generated
production. Generation and distribution assets are in poor condition and expensive fuel continues to
be used for generation in the absence of lower cost natural gas, while power tariffs have not been
revised since 1996. As a result, the sector cost the Government in 2012 over US$2.2 billion in fuel
subsidies per annum, or about 4 percent of GDP, representing almost half of the overall fiscal deficit
of the country. The fiscal burden represented by the sector will become worse, if the current shortterm infrastructure investments are completed without moving forward with meaningful institutional
and financial reforms. The Government is, however, moving forward in developing its offshore oil

The Minister of Finance has introduced new e-taxation measures aimed at reducing the cost of paying taxes.

5

and gas resources and is launching the tender process for the first licensing round for offshore gas
and oil exploration.
26.
Lebanon's water supply sector continues to be unable to meet demand, and service
provision remains weak. Currently, average technical and commercial losses of water are as high as
40 percent and further aggravate supply shortages. Small scale private water vendors, most of whom
are unregulated and many of whom are illegal, provide water of dubious quality. Unless measures
are taken to improve distribution efficiency and increase storage capacity, chronic water shortages
are expected to occur as early as 2020.
27.
Similarly, transport remains a major constraint on economic and social development.
Institutional capacity to oversee urban transport services is weak, and regulations to ensure minimum
levels of quality and safety are rarely enforced. Although international and primary roads are well
distributed throughout the country and in good condition, secondary and local roads are in a poor
state with less than 20 percent considered to be in acceptable condition. The GoL continues to face
major challenges in enforcing traffic rules and regulations, promoting private sector investments in
urban transport services, and mobilizing funding to carry out regular road maintenance. Public
transport services need to be better organized and developed. Moreover, excess costs, time-intensive
port clearance and land border crossings continue to impact Lebanon's competitiveness in trade.
Although considered a priority by the Government, the Environment sector remains neglected
28.
Until recently, the Environment sector has been a secondary priority, characterized by
an incomplete legal framework and ineffective policies. Environmental neglect has had an impact
on the economy resulting in a degradation amounting to US$800 million in 2005 (equivalent to 3.7
percent of GDP). Domestic and industrial discharge is released largely untreated in nature, and the
pollution of water resources is compounded by agricultural and dumps runoffs. The Ministry of
Energy and Water (MOEW) launched a National Wastewater Strategy in December 2012, and the
Government's National Municipal Solid Waste Strategy is to be finalized by June 2013. No strategy
exists for air pollution management although a number of air monitoring stations are being installed
and managed on an ad hoc basis.
Social vulnerabilities remain significant
29.
Poverty remains significant and regional disparities in living conditions are acute.
Nearly 27 percent of the Lebanese population, or 1 million people, are poor, living on less than US$4
per day, with an estimated 8 percent, or 300,000 people, living on less than US$2.40 per day. Poverty
is significantly higher in some regions, such as the North, which accounts for 21 percent of
Lebanon's population. Almost 40 percent of the poor and 46 percent of the extreme poor are
concentrated in slums around major cities. Over half of Lebanese citizens are able to cover only basic
needs, and 63 percent are not able to afford the basic necessities at some time. Of those who do have
surplus, almost 30 percent save for unexpected emergency/medical expenses, and only 7 percent save
to invest capital in business or assets.
30.
The influx of displaced Syrians is imposing a significant burden on Lebanon's ability to
provide services to local hosting communities and to the refugees. A large number of Syrians
have settled with host communities, many of which are already experiencing high levels of poverty.
Lebanese host communities are therefore bearing the brunt of the crisis, with emerging tensions
related to issues such as increasing rents, rising prices, and competition for livelihood opportunities.
Service provision, local governance strengthening, agricultural sector support, and civil society
6

assistance will be required along with infrastructure repair, livelihood assistance, and provision of
shelter.
31.
Primary healthcare services continue to be dominated by the private sector, as over 80
percent of facilities are privately owned. Only 10 percent of the population uses non-governmental
primary care centers, and only 20 percent of the population relies on a family physician. Maternal
mortality (150 deaths per 100,000 live births), is relatively high compared to other countries with
similar incomes. Weaknesses in the primary care system contribute to higher health care costs,
reduce the quality of care and generally worsen the equity of health service delivery. Approximately
half of the population is formally uninsured and more than 60 percent of total health spending is paid
out of pocket by households.
The economic downturn over the past two years has exerted pressure on household
32.
incomes, with rising food and energy prices taxing the poor and vulnerable. Geographic
disparities are striking within the country, as infrastructure investment and service delivery remain
concentrated in the Greater Beirut area. Moreover, Lebanon's North, the country's most
impoverished area, is feeling the effects of a sustained influx of displaced Syrians, putting the
Government's already constrained ability to deliver basic services under further pressure.
The CPS program remains relevant to support Government's priorities
33.
A Rapid Progress Review, conducted with GoL in September 2011 following the first
year of CPS implementation, recognized the persisting development challenges identified in the
strategy and the validity of the Bank Group's focus. The slow progress achieved in structural
reforms over the past two years further reinforces the urgency of addressing the CPS' priority areas:
declining private investment and heightened regional risks highlight the need for improving
competitiveness; lack of investment and growing demand call for improvement of basic
infrastructure services; high unemployment and low growth highlight the necessity for interventions
in the labor market, and for investments in public education; lastly, the deterioration of the fiscal
situation, combined with sluggish growth and increased unemployment, calls for an efficient and
inclusive social protection system for the most vulnerable. Continued attention to these challenges
and to building strong momentum for reform remain central to Lebanon's development prospects.
III. PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND

LESSONS LEARNED

Portfolio performance is mixed
34.
Portfolio Overview: As of March 31, 2013 the portfolio consists of 14 active projects
financed from a variety of sources including: IBRD, Lebanon Trust Fund (LTF), State and Peace
Building Fund (SPBF), Institutional Development Fund (IDF), and Program on Forests (PROFOR)
resources. These financing sources support interventions in sectors that include education, social
protection, urban development, transport, water, environment, private sector, social services,
telecommunications, and fiscal management reform, and represent a total commitment of US$477.7
million, of which a total of US$147.2 million has been disbursed. Four out of 14 projects are in
problem status: (i) the Second Emergency Social ProtectionImplementation Support Project (US$6
million; LTF) is undergoing restructuring to address unsatisfactory implementation of one of its
components; (ii) both the Second Education Development Project (US$40 million; IBRD) and the
Greater Beirut Water Supply Project (US$200 million; IBRD) experienced effectiveness delays due
to lengthy Parliamentary ratification procedures; and (iii) the National Volunteer Services Program
(US$2 million; SPBF) was delayed in meeting effectiveness conditions which hindered

7

implementation. The Lebanon portfolio is challenging as existing macro, governance, organizational,
and capacity issues are further compounded by the country's complex political economy 2.
35.
The underlying causes of mixed portfolio performance relate largely to the macro and
policy environment of the country which affects project implementation. For example, the two
loans approved by the Board since the launch of the CPS (the GreaterBeirut Water Supply Project
and the Second Education Development Project), experienced significant delays in becoming
effective, due to repeated delays in Cabinet approval, GoL loan signature, or Parliamentary
ratification. 3 These projects were only declared effective in 2012, 19 months after they were
approved. With elections looming and Lebanese political forces shifting into campaign mode, it is
likely that the remaining two projects approved by the Board since the launch of the CPS (the
Cultural Heritage and Urban Development Additional Financing and the Innovation and SME
Project) will face similar delays.
36.
Disbursement during the CPS period also reflects the impact of effectiveness delays. In
FY11, the average disbursement ratio for Lebanon stood at 44 percent, compared to 11 percent for
the MNA Region and 22 percent for the Bank, placing Lebanon as the second best performer in the
MNA Region. An increase of the disbursement ratio in FY11 versus FY10 was largely driven by the
acceleration of disbursements of several projects nearing their closing dates. However, in FY12 the
average disbursement ratio declined to 6 percent. The disbursement ratio now stands at only 3.5
percent. Declining disbursement can be attributed to the above-mentioned delays in effectiveness of
the GreaterBeirut Water Supply Project and the Second EducationDevelopment Project.
37.
IFC's Investment Portfolio stands at US$223 million in 12 companies as of end December
2012 and continues to perform well. The portfolio is concentrated in the financial markets sector
(particularly trade finance) followed by manufacturing and services. Guarantees to banks to facilitate
trade flows totaled US$676 million. With US$370 million of guarantees in FY12, Lebanon was the
most active user of the Global Trade Finance Program in the MENA region. In addition, a US$2
million equity investment was made in an early-stage ICT firm based in Tripoli helping to expand
operations and more than double its staff, while US$124 million in equity was invested in Medgulf
SAL, a Lebanese insurance company active across the MENA region. IFC also committed a US$2
million loan to a local microfinance institution, IFC's first investment in the sector in Lebanon, and
an US$8 million investment was approved to finance the improvement of distribution and collection
services in the electricity sector.
Trust Funds play a key role in the Lebanon Portfolio
38.
Trust Funds are integrated in the Bank's portfolio and support critical institutional
development. Bank-administered trust funds, including the Lebanon Trust Fund (LTF) 4, finance a
number of activities including: (i) improvement of Lebanon's social services; (ii) support to the
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority; (iii) improvement of water resources and agricultural
management; (iv) increase in youth civic engagement to improve youth employability and strengthen
social cohesion; and (v) assistance to the GoL and EdL in managing PCB inventories and disposal
2 Because of the macroeconomic situation and political environment, as well as a track record of unsatisfactory project outcomes,
Lebanon projects receive two risk flags (Country Environment and Country Record) from inception.
When political tensions escalate, political parliamentary blocs resort to boycotting parliamentary work. While the Parliament
has a constitutional responsibility to ratify all foreign loans and to examine draft laws referred by the Cabinet, the legislature has
been beset by repeated lack of quorum, which has resulted in repeated delays of the ratification of World Bank projects.
4 The Lebanon Trust Fund (LTF) was approved in September 2006 to assist in the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, and
recovery following the July/August 2006 hostilities. A total grant of US$70 million was transferred from IBRD surplus to the
Trust Fund.

8

options. Currently, there are nine active projects financed by trust funds (two by LTF, three by SPBF,
three by IDF, and technical assistance by PROFOR) for a total of US$14.5 million. One of the
recently approved IDF Grants aims to support civil society capacity development in the Ba'albeckHermel area. Specifically, the Grant will help poor communities secure their ID cards and other key
documents. The Grant has a strong gender focus and is expected to benefit around 800 women
through the provision of training and seminars on self-representation. The Trust Fund for Lebanon
was established to promote recovery from the 2006 conflict and provides a good example of
Bank/IFC integration. US$15 million of the LTF has enabled IFC to finance risk sharing facilities
and advisory projects and assist SMEs in gaining access to finance. In addition to funding a range of
IFC advisory projects, the LTF helped IFC leverage an additional US$120 million of SME finance
from local banks. Given this success, extension of the trust fund beyond its current 2014 end date is
being pursued.
39.
A good share of the operations envisaged under the CPS has been approved, with
US$297 million of new IBRD commitments provided in FY 11-FY13 for four investment operations
in the water, education, cultural heritage and urban development, and private sectors. The level of
new financing made available to the GoL during the first two and a half years of the CPS is in line
with the Tier I scenario, which envisaged a program concentrated on new investment lending
complemented by Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA).
The Bank's portfolio is complemented by outreach efforts and close partnership with other donors
40.
Over the past two years, the World Bank Group scaled up external communications,
civil society outreach and partnerships. The Bank Group has worked closely with the Government
to support communications through various workshops and consultative forums to disseminate the
results of studies and sustain momentum on policy reform, including business environment, public
financial management, energy, water, transport, regional development, education and social
protection. Public outreach was carried out under the 800-household survey on water connections in
the Ba'albeck area with PPIAF funding to determine the principal barriers to connecting households
to the infrastructure, which is key to the economic and financial sustainability of the water utility.5 A
new effort to reach out to Parliament is underway, with a view to sensitizing the legislative branch to
the scope and objectives of the Bank's engagement in Lebanon, and to seek Parliamentarians' views.
41.
At the same time, donor coordination continues in support of the Government's
economic reform program, as well as through a broad range of Bank activities. Multi and bi-lateral
donors, including Canada, Italy, France, Agence Frangaise de D6veloppement, Arab Fund, Kuwait
Fund, Islamic Development Bank, the European Union and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic
Affairs, actively co-finance or collaborate with the Bank Group in the areas of Water, Energy,
Cultural Heritage and Urban Development, Urban Transport, Environment, Social Protection and
Investment Climate. The Bank Group will continue to play a key role in leveraging donor flows in
the coming period, particularly in the areas of energy and transport.
42.
Lessons learned from closed projects: Four projects have closed over the CPS period: the
FirstMunicipal InfrastructureProject (US$30.1 million LTF); the Beka'a Emergency Water Supply
Project (US$15 million LTF); the Ba'albeck Water and Wastewater Project (US$43.5 million
IBRD); and the Emergency Power Sector Reform Capacity Reinforcement Project (US$5 million

The survey included questions on the gender impact of the Beka'a Regional Water Establishment's service delivery, which
allowed for an assessment of different gender experiences of access to and usage of water at the household level. This allowed for
a better understanding of how to operationalize gender in the water sector. Lessons learned are being applied to the Greater
Beirut Water Supply Project and to assist MOEW with implementation of the National Water Sector Strategy.

9

LTF). Several lessons from these operations will be useful in terms of informing future engagement
in these important sectors.
*

In the Water sector, and despite the Ba'albeck and West Beka'a projects having provided
target beneficiaries with significantly improved access to municipal water and sanitation
services, subscriptions to the regional water authority lagged over the project period, with
many residents preferring to obtain water through other more expensive sources. The
rebuilding of trust in publically provided services and subsequent modification of consumer
behavior is a lengthy process that must be accounted for in the design and implementation of
projects. This issue is especially relevant in water supply augmentation projects, such as the
Greater Beirut Water Supply Project, currently under implementation.

*

The Emergency Power Sector Reform Capacity Reinforcement Project informed the
development of the Government's Policy Paper for the Electricity sector, which is now the
cornerstone of the reform program. The Project also supported the investigation of Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) as a lower cost, more environmentally friendly option for power
generation. This encouraged the Ministry of Energy and Water to move ahead with plans to
develop an LNG facility. However, the Project's support for corporatization of EdL failed to
navigate the complex political economy surrounding this issue, and highlights the significant
politicization that will likely complicate progress on any higher-level reform agenda.

*

While initial results of IFC projects are encouraging, local banks' perception of high risk
associated with SMEs and atypical market segments (e.g., women-owned businesses, and
sustainable energy) continues to restrict lending; innovative approaches are needed to reach
these underserved markets. The proposed extension of the Trust Fund for Lebanon for a
further 6 years provides an opportunity to encourage further outreach to SMEs without ready
access to traditional bank financing.

43.
Main lessons for future CPS design and implementation: Bank assistance to Lebanon will
continue to be subject to substantial risks and will require flexibility to respond to emerging
challenges and changing priorities. The following important lessons can be drawn:
*

The overall fragile economic and political environment requires a flexible approach to
the work program so that the team can adapt to changing circumstances. Flexibility,
informed-risk taking and pragmatism are essential to successful engagement in such a
dynamic and uncertain operating environment.

*

Lending and analytical work should be deployed strategically, carefully sequenced, and
targeted to areas where there are realistic prospects for reform. AAA work in particular
has an important role to play in supporting nascent reform efforts and informing subsequent
lending operations.

*

Design simpler projects, use adaptable instruments and set realistic expectations. Give
greater attention to outcome/impact indicators, avoiding ambitious outcomes that are
unrealistic in the country context.
Project Readiness Filters. Ensure project readiness before approval, and all conditions of
effectiveness are met during preparation.
Effectiveness/ratification delays. Work closely with GoL in facilitating - to the extent
possible - the project effectiveness process through direct outreach to Parliament. Such
discussion has started already with members of Parliament.

*
*

*

Expand outreach and partnership with Government and civil society, including the
private sector, free media, and islands of public sector excellence. Increase the involvement
10

of local authorities/NGOs in prioritization, decision making, and implementation of local
level services.
*

Maintain a contingency to enable the Bank to support emergent or unanticipated needs.
Full commitment of Bank Group resources would limit the Bank's ability to respond
effectively in the event of crises, especially in social programs addressing the most
vulnerable.

IV. PROGRESS

TOWARDS ACHIEVING

CPS OBJECTIVES AND

OUTCOMES

44.
Because of the difficult country environment, a revision of CPS objectives towards more
realistic goals was warranted. However, progress has been made towards achieving the CPS
milestones and outcomes. The strategic goals were slightly revised towards less ambitious objectives
(Strategic Goal 1 Strengthened Fiscal and Public Financial Management; Goal 2 Improved
Competitiveness; Goal 3 Improved Economic Infrastructure; and Goal 4 Enhanced Human Capital

Development and Social Protection). Reforms in certain sectors have progressed, albeit timidly, and a
number of the indicators under the four pillars have been met or are on track to be met. Progress against
the milestones under the four development goals of the CPS, based on the revised strategic goals,
outcomes and indicators, is detailed in the Results Matrix (Annex I). A detailed report on progress to date
can be found in Annex II.
Goal 1 - Strengthened Fiscal and Public FinancialManagement
Good progress on the outcomes for all underlying goals has been achieved. The outcome of better
informed fiscal policy decisions was partially achieved for the area of strengthening the Fiscal Space.
As for Public Financial Management (PFM), the outcome of improved transparency and control
environment in public financial management was also partially achieved6 . The outcome of enhanced
capacity of Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) to carry out and analyze key survey for
Statistical Capacity Building was also partially achieved. Through a component on "engendering"
statistics funded by Bank TA, three analytical pieces were carried out by CAS on Gender and
Education, Gender and Health, and Gender and Labor. The CAS now has a link on Gender statistics
on their website and has launched a series called "Statistics in Focus", which initially covered Gender
statistics and has since been expanded to cover other sectors.
Goal 2 -

Improved Competitiveness

The underlying strategic goals for Business Environment have been partially achieved through
support of the WBG program in the areas of Access to Finance for SMEs and Women Entrepreneurs,
and in Telecommunications. The two new projects in these areas have been designed to be genderinformed, and to track the impact on women with the aim of reducing gender inequalities in access to
employment and entrepreneurship opportunities.
Goal 3 - Improved Economic Infrastructure
Reforms in the Water sector have progressed well and the outcome of increased access to and
reliability of potable water in targeted project areas was fully achieved. In the Electricity sector, the
Bank provided technical assistance for the development of an Energy Efficiency Framework and an
action plan for promoting energy efficiency measures in Lebanon. The outcome of improved
capacity to implement the Government's electricity sector reform strategy has only been partially
achieved to date. In the Urban Transport sector, the outcome of improved efficiency of existing
urban transport infrastructure and traffic management in the city of Beirut and Greater Beirut Area
6 The institutional strengthening of the PFM project has contributed to the emergence of female managers at the Ministry of
Finance (MoF). The two new units set up with the project support - the macro-fiscal and cash management units - are both
managed by women.

11

has been fully achieved, as traffic management is being reformed through the implementation of a
new Traffic Management program and the operation of a traffic management system. In the Local
Development area, the outcome of basic services restored and support for local recovery and
development are partially achieved to date. In the Environment sector, targets towards improved
environmental management have been partially achieved.
Goal 4 - Enhanced Human Capital Development and Social Protection
The strategic goals in the Education sector are progressing slowly. However, progress in the
implementation of the EDP II still needs to be determined given its recent effectiveness in January
2013 following extensive delays in Parliament ratification. In addition, the goal of improved
availability of education data for decision making in the Ministry of Education and Higher Education
is partially achieved. In the area of Social Protection and Social Safety Nets, although the planned
reforms at the National Social Security Fund were dropped, good progress was achieved with the
formal adoption of the National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP) in 2009, as well as the approval
of the New Entrants to Work program in 2011 by the Government. The NPTP has also ensured
gender equality by aiming to target 50 percent of female beneficiaries for the provision of benefits. In
the first round, out of the 84,322 total beneficiaries, 40,173 beneficiaries were female, or
approximately 48 percent.

Notable achievements have been made during the CPS period to strengthen gender
awareness and women's participation in society. According to MOSA's National Social
Development Strategy, prevalence of poverty is high among female-headed households in Lebanon.
The Social Promotion and Protection Project is aiming to target overall 50 percent female
beneficiaries out of a total number of direct beneficiaries through grants for income-generating
activities and the provision of social services. The New Entrants to Work Program under ESPISP II
targets 50 percent of women enrollment for soft skills training, as well as on-the-job training.
Furthermore, in collaboration with the Marseille Center for Mediterranean Integration, a regional
governance program is being launched focusing on accountability institutions, the justice sector and
poverty to work with civil society in providing legal information and counseling to women related to
personal status issues (divorce, marriage, alimony, child support, inheritance), and with Family
Courts to set up a system of assistance to poor women. The WBG has also increased its outreach to
women and women-led enterprises to promote greater economic inclusion of women. For example,
IFC provided advice to BLC on launching the "Women Empowerment Initiative", which offers
Lebanese women and women-led businesses information, training, and networking opportunities, as
well as financial products to achieve commercial success. As part of a broader effort targeting SMEs,
IFC assistance included gender-sensitivity training, focus group-based research and products that met
the financial needs of women. Elsewhere, IFC is integrating women's empowerment into other
projects such as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and business training.
V. THE WAY FORWARD
46.
As identified in the CPS, Lebanon's complex political economy makes it difficult to
foresee where reforms are most likely to take place. Close policy dialogue, analytical and advisory
services, and targeted investments can help inform and build momentum around the reform agenda but the inherently difficult country context, exogenous economic shocks, and regional political
developments that impact Lebanon's political landscape, can suddenly derail or significantly slow
down the Government's ability to translate its reform commitments into action. The Country
Partnership Strategy Progress Report reconfirms the validity of the two-tiered approach. The first two
years of CPS implementation have seen traction in key economic reform areas, but the consensus
necessary to implement broad structural reforms has not been developed. Therefore, a Bank
engagement that focuses on support through the existing portfolio (in fiscal and financial
management, water, transport, and urban development, support to SMEs, social protection, and
education), to be complemented by selected operations targeting transformational sectors such as
energy, transport and water that show potential for progress, appears appropriate under the present
circumstances. The Bank will ensure that gender-sensitive approaches are adopted in the existing
portfolio, as well as in the new pipeline for the remaining CPS period. Moreover, the Bank will
consider supporting the Government to address the impacts of the Syrian refugee crisis on Lebanese
hosting communities, by addressing the developmental implications of the Syrian displacement.
47.
The Bank will continue to engage with agents of change in Government and civil
society, using its analytical work to promote a strategic approach and to strengthen momentum
for reform. These activities will continue to be complemented by active IFC investment and
advisory services targeting SMEs, investment climate reform, climate change initiatives, south-south
investments, and broadening access to financial services. A particular opportunity exists by
extending the Lebanon Trust Fund that would allow the Bank Group to respond further to current
economic stresses and uncertainties by scaling up its support to SMEs, benefiting from experience
gained previously and by leveraging other donor initiatives.
48.
New lending: To date, US$297 million have been committed in IBRD investment loans
during the CPS period. Two new projects, totaling US$36.4 million, are expected to be presented for
13

approval in the remainder of FY13, and the indicative lending pipeline for FY14 currently foresees
US$168 million IBRD with potential additional lending in FY14-15 of up to US$100 million. This is
in line with the upper end of the indicative lending envelope (US$375 - US$550 million) envisaged
when the CPS was prepared. For IFC, an additional bank is expected to be added to IFC's Global
Trade Finance Program in FY13, while targeted advisory projects related to risk management for a
partner bank and corporate governance in the education sector will be completed by fiscal year-end.
The FY14 pipeline currently includes 3 equity transactions and an advisory assignment related to
sustainable energy finance.
49.
The improvement of basic infrastructure services, along with the provision of social
services and the establishment of an efficient social protection system, have emerged as
Government priorities for Bank support. A social protection project will facilitate access to social
development services at the community level and improve the coverage and targeting of the National
Poverty Targeting Program. An ICT project will strengthen innovation and entrepreneurship in the
Lebanese Mobile Internet Ecosystem 7 . A project is under preparation to reduce industrial pollution in
industrial enterprises, strengthen Government's monitoring and enforcement capabilities, and
establish a financial mechanism for environmental investments (Lebanon Environmental Pollution
Abatement Project). A new investment operation in the Agricultural sector will increase the onfarm income of smallholder farmers in remote areas. The new Financial Management Reform 2
project will continue to support MOF's efforts to improve the allocation of public financial resources,
enhance the efficiency and transparency of financial management systems, and tighten the control
environment. Bank engagement will also continue in the Water sector, where a new investment
operation will be considered to increase water supply to the Greater Beirut area to address the causes
of water shortages. Given the importance of reforming the Energy sector in terms of fiscal impact
and service delivery, the Bank Group will look to deepen its engagement by providing financing to
support the Government's reform program and to work with other partners to leverage Government
resources. This support could target Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) development through a possible
Partial Risk Guarantee, development of renewable generation and energy efficiency, transmission
strengthening or support for enhanced performance of EdL and electricity distribution. In the
Transport sector, Government recently inquired about potential Bank support for the new Beirut
Peripherique and A2 Highway project serving as a future alternative road for the existing Coastal
Highway.
50.
Analytical and advisory services will continue to underpin the CPS. Discussions with
Government have confirmed the relevance of the World Bank's ongoing Technical Assistance and
AAA program, which cuts across the four CPS pillars and informs the policy dialogue around
reform, as well as the design of the Bank's program in Lebanon. The TA and AAA support for
macroeconomic management, public financial management, business environment reform, structural
reforms in electricity and water, education, employment and labor markets, and social safety nets
remain a priority. The Bank Group will strive to adapt its analytical work to GoL requirements in
terms of addressing the ongoing or new external shocks and crises, and will increase its
responsiveness to provide just-in-time technical assistance for specific policy issues.
51.
Through the State and Peace-building Fund, the Bank has mobilized US$1.2 million to
address some of the immediately apparent development needs in light of the escalating Syrian
displacement crisis: (i) US$900,000 has been granted for capacity building and support to local
communities hosting Syrians, implemented through Save the Children and other NGOs (the project is
expected to be implemented over 18 months and provide direct benefits to hosts, Syrians and several

RiSKS

52.
In 2010, the CPS had emphasized risks related to sectarian interests obstructing the
implementation of the economic reform program, Lebanon's dependence on foreign capital
inflows, systemic corruption and weak governance, the fragile internal political environment

and the tense regional security environment. Unfortunately, the identification of these risks proved
to be prophetic. The necessary broad consensus around the reform program could not be built, and
the resulting lack of reform implementation and fiscal adjustment perpetuates the country's macrofiscal fragility. Lebanon's economy remains dependent on foreign capital inflows to absorb the
country's large sovereign debt, and sectarian interests continue to constrain political will to address
15

systemic corruption and governance issues. The unforeseen crisis that engulfed Syria as of March
2011 has further compounded these risks contributing to inter-sectarian tensions, leading to incidents
of violence across the country and resulting in an influx of displaced persons. The steady stream of
Syrians coming to Lebanon having been displaced by the conflict is straining the Government's
delivery of essential services in Lebanese host communities and may increase sectarian tensions even
further. Divisions within the Cabinet, exacerbated by the coalition's inability to reach agreement on a
policy response to the Syrian crisis, along with a stalemate in the executive and legislative branches
of the Government, impede the enactment of important bills, regulations and appointments which
remain pending. Political and sectarian spill-over effects of the Syrian crisis, especially if prolonged,
might turn out to be far reaching. Under these circumstances, the formation of a new Government
following the upcoming parliamentary elections will likely take considerable time and effort by
Lebanese political forces to negotiate coalition agreements. The delay in elections and its impact on
the Government will substantially affect Government's and Parliament's legitimacy and ability to act.
As such, this situation is likely to continue to affect successful implementation and performance of
the WBG program.

Over the remaining period of CPS implementation, the Bank Group's assistance
53.
program will be strongly challenged by the complex country environment and related risks.
The WBG recognizes that it has only limited tools to mitigate for political risks, and it is closely
monitoring the country and macroeconomic environment, as well as regional developments. The
Bank will continue to adjust to this situation by taking into account lessons learned in order to
mitigate some of the risks affecting the Bank's program: For example, efforts will be made to ensure
implementation readiness of all projects before Board approval so that even if there are delays in
parliamentary ratification, implementation can be jumpstarted as soon as effectiveness is achieved. In
addition, project design can incorporate contingencies to help address additional costs incurred as a
result of delays and increased risk premia associated with increased uncertainties in the environment.
Beyond these measures, the Bank will engage more broadly with different stakeholders across the
political spectrum to ensure a solid understanding of the Bank's work in the country and the
objectives of the specific Bank-financed operations. To this end, interactive sessions are being
planned with members of Parliament to review and discuss this CPS Progress Report and the
proposed pipeline of projects.

54.
The displacement of large numbers of Syrians is exacerbating Lebanon's existing socioeconomic challenges and is affecting the Bank's portfolio. It is foreseeable for the remaining CPS
period that this situation will challenge the strategic goal to "strengthen fiscal and public financial
management" as the large-scale influx of Syrians also has a budgetary impact on Lebanon that
already struggles with pre-existing fiscal problems. Moreover, the Syrian influx will affect
significantly our human development (HD) portfolio related to the provision of services (education,
health and social services), in particular in disadvantaged regions. Project development objectives of
the HD portfolio may be jeopardized as originally set targets may be difficult to achieve within the
originally planned timeframe8 . While continuing to support the authorities in improving effective
service delivery - as is the case with the proposed Social Promotion and Protection Project - and
providing support for prudent public financial management, the Bank team undertook and will
continue to seek flexible adjustments to the Bank program where warranted: as such the strategic
goals of the CPS as well as the outcomes have been revised. The Bank will also consider retrofitting
projects in the existing portfolio to address increased service delivery needs, livelihoods support and
safety nets in affected hosting communities.
For example, the Education Development Project II, which focuses on expanding early childhood education in disadvantaged
areas, will need to adopt a different approach as facilities are being overcrowded with new students or occupied by refugee
families. Necessary reforms such as reducing the number of contract teachers (most of whom had lower qualifications) are set
back as these new teachers would be retained to cope with additional demands for educational services.

DETAILED OVERVIEW ON PROGRESS TO DATE UNDER THE VARIOUS SECTORS

Some institutional reforms have progressed with strong World Bank TA and AAA support

*

Public Financial Management has been strengthened with the establishment in 2012 of a
macro-fiscal department within the Budget Directorate at the MoF, and the development of the
conceptual framework for a multi-year budget planning process (MTEF), but the actual MTEF
could not be finalized in the absence of an approved budget since 2005. Efforts have therefore
been refocused on key elements to improve fiscal transparency and budget management,
including the revision of the budget classification to bring it in line with GFS 2001 norms; the
revision of the public accounting law; the development of a budget preparation circular, which is
now based on a macro-fiscal framework and clear costing norms; the adoption of accounting
procedures and guidelines, and the introduction of commitment controls and payment forecasting
to avoid over-commitments and improve cash management. In addition, reforms in the debt
management area have moved forward with the establishment of a new Public Debt Directorate
that assumed both analytical and operational functions. In this regard, the Directorate has
engaged on: (i) the formulation of a new medium-term debt management strategy that aims to
inform senior policymakers of the high debt committee on cost-risk parameters and scenarios for
managing the debt in Lebanon; and (ii) the installation of DEMFAS 6 as to gradually assume the
recording and operational functions of debt issuances.

*

Statistical Capacity Building. The World Bank provided Technical Assistance to the Central
Administration for Statistics (CAS) on developing statistical technical capacity in poverty
monitoring, through poverty analysis and social statistics (TAPS), and the design of a Household
Budget Survey. Funding to the Government in revising the Statistical Law and designing an
implementation plan for the Statistical Master Plan is ongoing.

*

Business Environment. A Bank Development Grant Facility (DGF) regional partnership
program is ongoing in partnership with two leading regional incubators/accelerators to build the
capacity and technological skills of nascent entrepreneurs to start a business and make it grow.
This program, in which Lebanon participates, complements Bank private sector development and
financing operations in the region by providing strategic technical support such as skills training,
mentorship and networking, to create and build a critical mass of dynamic start-ups able to
benefit from Bank and other financing projects. In addition, the regional DGF program will also
include tools and materials that can have broader outreach and foster inclusion. The aim is to
bolster lasting cultural change in support of entrepreneurship and promote a sustainable
entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Middle East. A monthly Arabic entrepreneurship and earlystage investment newsletter will be produced in both print and online forms as well as Arabic
videos and TV skits featuring success stories, forums, educational articles, competitions and
entrepreneurship news and events. Success stories will feature successful female entrepreneurs
and diaspora entrepreneurs spotlighting those who are giving back to the region.

*

Infrastructure: In the Water sector, the technical, financial and managerial capacity of the
Beka'a Regional Water Establishment (BRWE) and the Beirut Mount Lebanon Water
Establishment (BMLWE) was strengthened through the appointment of the Managing Director
for the BRWE and the development of a business plan, as well as the implementation of several
important utility strengthening activities within the BMLWE. Moving forward, the Greater Beirut
Water Supply Project will continue to support utility strengthening of the BMLWE in general, as
27

well as the implementation of the Ministry of Energy and Water's National Water Sector
Strategy more broadly. Urban Transport and traffic management is being reformed through
the implementation of a new Traffic Management program and the operation of a traffic
management system, which has seen the establishment of a Traffic Management Center. Within
the framework of a new Public Transport Strategy, GoL is now launching the procurement for
the design of infrastructure, operational planning and contract preparation for the priority lines of
a Bus Rapid Transit system in the Greater Beirut Area, and is preparing the restructuring plan for
the Railway and Public Transport Authority. Although a roadmap for reform of EdL was
developed in the Electricity sector, which calls for its corporatization in accordance with
commercial principles, and builds its management capacity, this roadmap has still not garnered
political consensus and its implementation remains uncertain. To improve management capacity
of the Municipal sector at the central Government level, a Municipal Observatory was
established which is collecting data on local tax revenues and transfers from central Government.
Human Development: Following the establishment of a database on the poor and vulnerable
population using the proxy-means testing (PMT) targeting mechanism - which was supported
financially and technically by the World Bank through the Second Emergency Social Protection
Implementation Support Project and Bank technical assistance - the impact, efficiency and
effectiveness of Lebanon's social safety nets is being improved through the implementation of a
National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP), which is now fully operational. For the first time in
its modern history, Lebanon today has a program whose sole objective is poverty reduction and
which has already reached thousands of Lebanese households through the distribution of
education and health benefits. The GoL intends to add electricity benefits to the program as well.
The program can be scaled up in times of economic difficulties acting like a true safety net
program and helping to build Lebanon's resilience to shocks. More importantly, the NPTP is
based on a transparent targeting methodology which only uses poverty (welfare) as the criterion
for eligibility (not confessional or political affiliation). Through the NPTP, institutional capacity
has been built in the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Prime Ministry.
Policy dialogue on reform informed by the Bank's knowledge services and Technical Assistance
*

Bank Technical Assistance (TA) and analytical and advisory services underpinned new
investments, and have been instrumental in helping the Government advance on reforms.
Bank TA on public financial management helped GoL improve the budget preparation process
and its comprehensiveness, by strengthening the integration of the current and capital budget,
placing the annual budget in a multi-year perspective, and strengthening budget execution with a
focus on the treasury management function. A study on Lebanon 's Capital Inflows helped
analyze the nature and drivers of these inflows, interactions with monetary and fiscal policies,
and the extent to which they can foster sustainable, broad-based growth in Lebanon. Another
study on Boosting Growth and Social Welfare in a Context of Fiscal Consolidation is focusing
on macro-fiscal sustainability and improving fiscal space. Several policy notes on electricity,
telecommunications, and public sector wages are helping to address the key macro-fiscal
sustainability and fiscal space constraints.

*

Procurement Law. Despite the Procurement Law not being yet adopted, there has been some
engagement including having active participation of teams from various Lebanese stakeholders in
Regional Conferences on Governance and Regional Public Procurement Reform Efforts
(Amman; July 2012), and Improving the Results of Public Procurement through Transparency,
Stakeholder Promotion and Capacity Building (Tunis; December 2012). Following these
conferences, a round table discussion on Procurement Reform in Lebanon took place in March
2013 to discuss with relevant stakeholders the ongoing reforms in the national public
28

procurement system, the challenges faced in implementing the reforms, and how the Bank can
provide support in the short and long term.
In the Electricity sector, the World Bank provided close support to MoEW in the development
of its Policy Paper on the Electricity Sector, through the Emergency Power Sector Reform
Capacity Reinforcement Project, and additional studies on LNG supply and fuel conversion.
Several Bank-executed technical assistance activities were also provided for the development of
an Energy Efficiency Framework, an action plan for promoting energy efficiency measures in
Lebanon, and for the development of a wind power market in Lebanon. To support the
Government in the identification of policy options to reform the Telecommunications sector
while addressing their fiscal impact, the Bank provided substantive advice in the development of
the Telecommunication Sector Strategy, including TA on Broadband Strategy and Deployment,
and financed capacity building to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. In the Water
sector, the Bank played an active role in supporting the development and implementation of the
Government's strategy for improving the sector's performance, through TA in the development
of a National Water Sector Strategy and the development of its own World Bank Country Water
Sector Assistance Strategy. Technical assistance and analytical and advisory services to the
Ministry of Public Works and Transport were instrumental in supporting the finalization of
GoL's public transport strategy to improve mobility within the Greater Beirut Area, through the
development of an integrated public transport system plan ("TransBeirut"). In the Environment
sector, the World Bank partnered with the GoL in the preparation of a Country Environmental
Analysis (CEA, June 2011), which aimed at providing the analytical underpinning for integrating
environment into the development process. One of the main recommendations of the CEA was
"Managing Environmental Risks", to assist the GoL in reducing environmental threats due to
pollution and natural resources degradation, and adapt to potential environmental perils due to
climate change. In July 2011, the GoL issued its Ministerial Declaration which included
"Managing Environmental Risks" as one of its priorities. The CEA also included a study on
municipal solid waste, as well as a set of options to upgrade municipal solid waste management
systems. A recently approved IDF grant for Environmental Compliance will help improve
environmental compliance in the industrial sector (particularly in small and medium enterprises)
in Lebanon.
*

In the Education sector, the Bank's support to the development of a National Education Sector
Strategy in 2010 through the first Education Development Project (EDP I), and institution
building of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE), resulted in the adoption of
policies and programs focusing on early childhood development and teacher professional
development, which are supported through the recently effective Second Education Development
Project. As a result of persistent and consistent capacity building, the MEHE today is leading a
large and comprehensive, multi-donor supported education reform program. The Bank also
supported MEHE in analysis of the financial sustainability of its private teachers' pension fund.
In the area of higher education, the World Bank has provided in-time TA to MEHE focused on
university governance. 16 Lebanese universities have participated in the university governance
screening card exercise leading to two workshops where a national report was presented and
discussed. This work is not just informing the policy dialogue on quality assurance in the sector
but also helping MEHE in getting all higher education institutions engaged in the process.

*

Bank assistance was instrumental in helping GoL advance the social security, health insurance
and safety net agenda through TA support to the establishment of the NPTP, support to
modernization of the social insurance system, coupled with TA for drafting of new pension law;
and support to improving efficiency of Ministry of Public Health expenditures through creation
29

of a utilization management function and a modern hospital contracting system based on
performance indicators.
*

A multi-year technical cooperation program on labor markets entitled "MILES"
(Macroeconomy, Investment Climate, Labor, Education, Social Protection) assisted the GoL in
identifying constraints to the creation of quality jobs, presenting policy options in the areas of
social insurance and labor market programs and simulating their macroeconomic and labor
market impacts. The MILES program has resulted in the identification of an innovative active
labor market program for first-time job seekers (the New Entrants to Work Program) which aims
to address both demand and supply side constraints in the Lebanese labor market and, therefore
increase the employability of Lebanese school and university graduates. The MILES program
also resulted in the modeling of the Lebanese economy through the development of a
Computable General Equilibrium Model, which is being employed by the Government to
simulate the impact of proposed social policies such as increases in wages and salaries on
growth, investment, and employment levels. Finally, the Bank's programmatic TA in pension
reform has resulted in a revised proposal for private worker's pension, which is expected to be
submitted to Cabinet and Parliament in the coming months.

*

A grant has just been approved to build capacity of civil society in the Ba'albeck-Hermel area to
provide legal information, advice and counseling to poor communities in relation to securing IDs
and personal documents (birth and marriage certificates), thereby ensuring that the poor
communities affected will not be excluded from social benefits (health, education), employment
and political participation (voting). The program will also develop capacity of local officials to
advise poor persons on the proper procedures, and simplify procedures to ensure easier access.

IFC's Program
The IFC significantly scaled up its advisory services activities. Aiming to increase access to
finance, particularly for SMES, IFC is advising a major local bank - Banque Libanaise Pour Le
Commerce (BLC) - to establish a comprehensive offering targeting women and women-owned firms.
This is part of a holistic project that looks to increase the bank's outreach to SMEs in general and
improve its risk management practices. IFC is facilitating a South-South sharing of knowledge
between BLC and other banks in the region. In addition, IFC is working with another major
Lebanese bank - Banque Libano-Francaise(BLF) - to scale up its financing of sustainable energy
projects (i.e., those related to energy efficiency, renewables and cleaner production) to reduce
greenhouse gases and lessen the impact on the environment. Likewise, IFC also helped the Lebanese
Green Building Council to develop the green building rating system "ARZ", and conducted five
green building assessments in cooperation with local consulting firms to build capacity in the field.
To improve the investment climate, the Bank Group assisted the Government to develop its
"Improving the Business Environment in Lebanon" program, which is led by the Office of the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers as Secretariat. In this context, IFC launched a project to
simplify procedures for licensing in the tourism sector, which is currently under implementation.
Working with the Tripoli Bar Association and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Beirut,
IFC is developing local capacity to offer mediation as a means to resolve business disputes, including
the training of local mediators and institutional capacity building for the mediation centers. Projects
to improve the commercial registry, strengthen the bankruptcy and insolvency regime, and draft a
modern law on secured transactions (which allows for greater use of movable property as collateral)
were signed with the Office of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, with the draft secured
transactions law currently being finalized. The IFC and the Bank are working together to assess the
national payment system, under a project with the Central Bank of Lebanon.
