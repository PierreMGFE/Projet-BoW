REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Senegal aspires to be a high middle income country by the next decade but has been
stuck in a low-growth equilibrium since 2006. Senegal has not shared the rapid growth
experienced by many other Sub-Saharan African countries over the last decade. Compared to an
average growth rate of 6 percent in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), growth in Senegal
averaged only 4 percent between 2000 and 2010, and only 3.3 percent since 2006, with
population growth at 2.5 percent. On the fiscal front, the expansion of current spending over the
last six years (from 13.8 to 18.1 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2011) has significantly
reduced the government’s fiscal space. The deficit went from 3.0 percent in 2005 to 6.8 percent
in 2011, and total debt is back to pre-Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) levels. Senegal
needs to implement policies that improve governance, increase resilience to external shocks and
are conducive to accelerate inclusive and sustainable growth, create jobs, and improve service
delivery to protect the poor and vulnerable.
ii.
Poor governance has slowed progress in poverty reduction. With 47.6 percent of its
population living in poverty, including 15 percent in extreme poverty, there has been no
significant reduction in poverty between 2006 and 2011. The rapid decline of poverty from 55.2
to 48.5 percent between 2001 and 2005 was followed by relative stagnation, with a timid decline
from 48.5 percent to 46.7 percent between 2006 and 2011. Senegal traditionally had a good
system of public accountability and transparency, but these systems were severely weakened
between 2006 and 2011, as illustrated by Senegal’s drop in the Governance indicators.
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for Senegal declined from 3.6 to
2.9 between 2007 and 2011. Addressing issues of governance in a comprehensive way will be
critical for medium to long term growth.
iii.
Natural disasters such as droughts and flooding have slowed growth and increased
the vulnerability of the whole economy. Like many other countries, Senegal is suffering from a
rise in the incidence of natural disasters. Senegal is vulnerable to four main natural hazards:
drought; locust invasion; flooding, often with associated epidemics; and a sea level rise
associated with coastal erosion. The government needs to put in place strong governance and
cost-effective systems to manage these economic, social, and climate-related disasters in order to
protect growth and secure livelihoods.
iv.
Overall, the private sector’s ability to stimulate the economy has been limited due to
a weak investment climate and declining competitiveness, underpinned by weak
governance systems and poor implementation follow up. Senegal’s private sector activity has
i

deteriorated since the mid-2000s, as evidenced by the country’s export performance. Senegal is
ranked 117 out of 144 countries in the 2012 Global Competitiveness Index as inadequate
physical and human infrastructure, weak institutions (business environment), and governance
continue to weigh on Senegal’s growth. Senegal urgently needs to restore the competitiveness of
its economy to meet its growth objectives.
v.
Senegal's Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.459, ranked 155 out of 187
countries with comparable data, compared to an SSA average of 0.463 in 2012. Overall, Senegal
spends, as a share of GDP, resources that are comparable to its peers, but the intra-sectoral
distribution of resources is inefficient, leading to poor outcomes. While the size of the
government has grown from 24.1 percent of GDP in 2005 to 29.7 percent in 2011, access to
improved services and the quality of services have not improved in many social sectors. Overall,
a lack of clear governance and accountability systems is undermining performance in the social
sectors.
vi.
To exit the low equilibrium growth trap, the new Government has developed an
ambitious program to tackle these challenges. The Stratégie Nationale de Développement
Economique et Social (SNDES) intends to reverse this downward trend by increasing the
productivity of Senegal’s whole economy, public and private, both of which are underperforming
compared to the past and to its peers. The SNDES builds on the Government’s political program,
the Yonnu Yokute, and the joint action platform of civil society, the Assises Nationales.
vii.
This Joint Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Fiscal Years 2013 to 2017, of the
World Bank, IFC and MIGA, intends to support SNDES priorities and Senegal's efforts to
engage in a recovery and a higher growth and shared prosperity path over the medium-term
(over the next 5 years). This CPS proposes to leverage substantial amounts of resources from
collaboration with the IFC, MIGA, TFs, and also by favoring more regional projects and donor
coordination. The overarching focus of the CPS will be on improving governance, building
resilience, restoring growth and fiscal space. The Bank program is focused on one foundation
and two pillars as follow:
 Foundation: Strengthening the governance framework and building resilience. In line
with the Bank’s updated GAC agenda, the CPS interventions will focus on strengthening
governance systems and processes to enhance the predictability, credibility and
accountability of the government. In addition, the CPS will also have specific activities in
the area of Disaster Risk and Sustainable Land Management to enhance resilience across
the whole economy.
 Pillar 1: Accelerating inclusive growth and creating employment. Given fiscal
constraints, the thrust of work will focus on activities which help reduce government
spending by further involving the private sector and leveraging regional and international
markets. This approach, coupled with efforts to improve the overall business environment,
ii

will lead to an improved macro-economic and fiscal framework. Increased private sector
activity would in turn underpin job creation over the medium term.
 Pillar 2: Improving service delivery. The CPS will focus on assisting the Government to
improve the allocation and effectiveness of expenditures and the impact on results,
particularly in the social sectors. This pillar will focus on improving governance, access
and equity in the social sectors.
viii.

World Bank Group support to Senegal has some risks but also high returns. The
program could suffer if: (i) the global economic recovery is delayed; (ii) price shocks persist;
(iii) regional and political instability in Mali and other Sahelian countries remain unresolved; (iv)
governance issues remain unresolved; and (v) there is inadequate capacity to implement and
monitor the program. The team has identified a series of mitigation measures for these risks,
which include open and transparent dialogue with the government, frequent program monitoring,
the use of civil society to monitor and assess programs and progress, continued dialogue with
donors and other international agencies on the international political environment, and close
collaboration with the IMF on the macroeconomic and fiscal issues.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

I.

Country Context

Social and Political Context
1.
The population of Senegal is estimated at 13.6 million with an annual growth rate of
about 2.5 percent. Senegal is made up of over twenty ethnic groups, the largest being
Wolofs/Lebous (40.8%) followed by Pulars (27.6%), Sereres (14.4%), Diolas (5.3%) and
Mandinkas (4.2%). Senegal obtained independence in 1960 and kept the main administrative
structures that had been in place prior to independence. In 1982, Senegal joined The Gambia to
form the short-lived confederation of the Senegambia, but the merger did not succeed and in
1989 the union was dissolved. Present day Senegal is divided into 14 regions, 113 municipalities,
370 rural communities and 14,400 villages.
2.
Senegal is one of the most stable countries in Africa, and has considerably
strengthened its democratic structures. Since independence in 1960, Senegal has had four
presidents. The first President, Leopold Sedar Senghor, ruled from 1960 to 1980, and handed
over power peacefully to Abdou Diouf. In 2000 Senegal witnessed the first truly contested
elections which resulted in a democratic political transition with the Senegalese Democratic
Party (PDS) and Abdoulaye Wade winning over the traditional Socialist Party (PS) of Leopold
Sedar Senghor and Abdou Diouf.
3.
In the 2012 elections, Macky Sall, former Prime Minister of Senegal, challenged the
incumbent President Abdoulaye Wade, and won the runoff election with 65.8 percent of the
vote and was sworn in as President on April 2, 2012. The elections were the first to feature
two female candidates, and they were characterized by a high degree of transparency, and
universal acceptance of the results. Although deadly protests preceded the first round of voting,
the electoral process was peaceful and resulted in Senegal’s second democratic transition.
4.
Civil Society played an important role in bringing about political change in Senegal
in 2012. Youth movements, in particular the M23 movement and the Y-en-a-Marre, were vocal
about the deteriorating governance environment as well as the need to respect the constitution
and the democratic transition process. The June 2011 attempt by the then government to modify
the Constitution, allowing victory in presidential elections with only 25 percent of votes, was
rejected by the Legislature after strong resistance from the population, thus demonstrating the
resilience of civil society
5.
The election also highlighted the important role of the media to foster transparency
and protect the integrity of the elections. All these movements built on the 2011 “Assises
Nationales du Senegal,” another broad-based consultative civil society initiative that prepared a
Charter of Democratic Governance embraced by the current president during the campaign.

1

6.
Gender equity has been high on the new government’s agenda and, for the first time
in Senegal’s history, gender parity was a requirement for legislative elections. This
contributed to the new National Assembly being composed of 43 percent women (up from 22
percent in the previous assembly). The President’s coalition “Benno Bokk Yakaar” won 119 of
the 150 seats. The former senate has been dissolved and Senegal has returned to a unicameral
system.
7.
Senegal’s political stability will remain at risk if the issues of vulnerability and
fragility in Casamance are not addressed. This will require reinforcing social resilience
throughout the country and building more national cohesion. Social resilience in the country
generally, and particularly in Casamance, has prevented the crisis from deteriorating into civil
war. It is a sign of hope that the new Senegalese authorities are convinced that, without peace in
Casamance, it will be difficult to break the fragility trap (Box1).
Box 1 : Fragility in the Casamance – a 30-year-old Conflict
The Casamance region has, for the last 30 years, been under-going Africa’s longest lowintensity conflict, causing hundreds of deaths and injuries. The Movement of Democratic
Forces of Casamance (MDFC), experiencing a sense of abandonment and distance from
Dakar, launched a separatist movement in 1982 and created an armed wing in 1985. It is
estimated that between 30,000 and 60,000 people have been displaced due to the conflict.
Fighting between the Government of Senegal soldiers and MDFC rebels has affected the
potential of Casamance to contribute fully to the economy of Senegal and it is estimated that
the conflict has cut agricultural production by 50%. The tourism industry has also been
devastated by the conflict, with many of the industry’s 16,000 employees being dismissed as
a result of the continuing struggle. More generally, livelihoods have suffered as insecurity
has stifled traditional and commercial agriculture, trade and tourism.
The newly-elected President has stressed that resolving the Casamance crisis is a top
priority. Immediately after being sworn-in, he made his first trip to The Gambia to
demonstrate how important the resolution of the Casamance question is to Senegal. Cabinet
Ministers met on June 27, 2012 in Ziguinchor under the President’s chairmanship, and he
reaffirmed that his government was open to talks aimed at finding durable peace in
Casamance. The prospect of re-engaging in Casamance to find a peaceful solution has
generated interest within the political leadership of the country, as well as among civil society
organizations, local communities, donor agencies and the Movement of Democratic Forces of
Casamance (Mouvement des Forces Démocratiques de Casamance )
World Bank 2012

Poverty, Gender and the Millennium Development Goals
8.
Poverty in Senegal declined only slightly over the last six years to 46.7 percent in
2011 from 48.3 percent in 2005. This contrasts with a decline from 55.2 percent to 48.3 percent
between 2001 and 2005, during this period, growth was moderately inclusive, with a growth
2

elasticity of 1.1, slightly better than the SSA average (1.0). The disappointing performance in the
more recent period is consistent with the macroeconomic environment and with a series of
shocks that affected welfare during 2006-2011, including poor rains, global food and fuel price
shocks, and floods, as well as deterioration in overall governance. However, the growth elasticity
of poverty also appears to have fallen. Extreme poverty, defined as the portion of the population
whose total consumption is less than the cost of a food basket providing minimum calorie
requirements, dropped more slowly – from 17 percent to 15 percent between 2001 and 2011.
9.
The poverty gap between Dakar and rural areas has widened. Poverty remains
highest in rural areas, where 57.1 percent of the population was poor in 2011 compared to 26.1
percent in urban Dakar. From 2001 to 2011, poverty was reduced the most in Dakar, where it
decreased by 12 percentage points, compared to 8 and 4 percent in rural areas and “other urban
centers”’ respectively. Seventy percent of the poor lived in rural areas in 2011, unchanged from
2001. Of the extreme poor, more than a third lived in the Kolda or Ziguinchor regions of the
Casamance. About 62 percent of people living in households with a head whose main occupation
was agriculture were poor, compared to 33 percent for other occupations.
10.
Inequality is significant and has remained stable in Senegal over the last decade. The
Gini coefficient fell slightly from 39.2 in 2001 to 37.4 in 2005 and 37.8 in 2011. However, the
ratio of the expenditures by the top quintile compared to the bottom quintile went up from 6.7 in
2001 to 7.0 in 2005 and then back to 6.9 in 2011. The Gini coefficient is about average for SSA.

11.
Lack of education, household size, and the gender of the head of the household are
major correlates of poverty in Senegal. In 2011, 54 percent of people living in a household
whose head had no formal education lived in poverty, unchanged since 2005. In contrast, poverty
among those living in households whose head had primary education came down from 43
percent to 34 percent over the same period. About 83 percent of the poor live in households with
a non-educated head, a figure unchanged over the past 10 years. Additionally, larger household
3

size is strongly associated with higher poverty. The poverty rate of people living in femaleheaded households is 35 percent, compared to 51 percent for male-headed households.
12.
The poor suffer more shocks than the non-poor and have fewer or no coping
strategies due to the absence of an effective safety net system. Unsustainable management of
natural resources impacts poor and rural households more acutely. Rural and poor households
depend heavily on natural resources, primarily for food production as well as for wood energy,
hunting and gathering. Terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems are at risk, with land degradation
affecting 34 percent of the land area, causing deforestation (0.5%) and overfishing, and
contributing to increased poverty. The level of food insecurity for 28 percent of the population is
extremely high. Figure 1 presents the determinants of poverty.

Despite clear progress over the past decade, many MDGs will be difficult to achieve.
There has been significant improvement in a number of goals where Senegal is on track to meet
the MDG goals. These include goals for malnutrition, gender equity in primary and secondary
schooling, improved water source, and under-5 mortality rates. In general, programs which have
had specific measureable objectives and clear goals, effective targeting to poor and
disadvantaged groups, indicators which are monitored with significant community involvement,
4

accountability mechanisms, and social mobilization strategies have had positive results and are
on track to reach MDG goals.
14.
Health indicators addressed by “vertical” programs including HIV/AIDS, malaria
and nutrition have performed well. For example, the proportion of children sleeping under
treated bed nets increased from 14 percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 2011 (DHS). The
malnutrition program, which specifically targeted pregnant women and children under 5 in poor
rural and urban areas, has reached over 1.1 million children under 5 (60 percent of the
population), leading to a dramatic fall in chronic malnutrition and child stunting to 16 percent in
2011. The primary education gender equity goals have been met by targeting specific regions; in
2011, the ratio of girls to boys in primary enrollment was 106 compared to 86 in 2000.
15.
Successive external and domestic crises over 2006-2011 have undermined growth
and delayed progress on some MDGs, such as MDG1 – reducing poverty by half. Regional
disparities in access and overall low quality of basic social services remain a serious concern. In
the education sector, despite high admission rates at grade one, completion rates still remain low
due to high dropout rates at the first and fifth grades and also the low access rates in some areas
where people are asking for a different education that is more aligned with their religious beliefs.
Little progress has been made on improving MDG 5 relative to maternal mortality, which
remains high at 392 for 100,000 births. Those indicators addressed by the overall health system
have not seen major improvements due to weak accountability systems for providing good
services and also inefficient intra-sectoral budget allocations. The modern contraception rate is
still low (at 12.6% in 2010, from 10.3% in 2005). The rate of births assisted by trained personnel
has only increased marginally to 65% (DHS 2010) from 52 % in 2005, and immunization
coverage has not increased substantially – all of which explains why neonatal mortality is still
high (36 per thousand in 2010).
Country Statistical Systems
16.
Since 2004, Senegal has strengthened its National Statistical System (NSS) with the
establishment of a more independent statistical institution, Agence Nationale de la
Statistique et de la Démographie (ANSD), a statistical law, a National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics (NSDS), and a new statistical school (ENSAE-Senegal). The new law
was approved in 2011 and it includes the organization of a nation-wide survey program, more
open access to data, and the management for results approach for statistical development. The
main constraints to the NSS are: difficulty in access to primary data, sector statistics not being
fully included in the SDS, ad-hoc surveys based on availability of funding, and poor
management systems leading to difficulty with collection and dissemination. Development
Partners have established a Thematic Group, chaired by AfDB and UNFPA, to finance NSDS
implementation and to coordinate efforts in supporting Senegal’s statistical development.
Economic Developments
17.
Senegal’s economic growth cycles reflect large effects from economic and internal
governance shocks. From 1995 to 2005 the economy grew at 4.5 percent. Following the
1994 devaluation, the economy entered a relatively long period of sustained high level growth.
5

Growth peaked at about 6 percent in 2003 and 2004, mostly owing to good weather conditions, a
favorable external environment and appropriate domestic policy. With high real growth rates,
strong macro-economic consolidation, and HIPC debt relief of around US$800 million, Senegal
ran large primary surpluses, allowing for ample fiscal space to increase investment and underpin
growth. On the external front, robust capital inflows, rising remittances, and increasing FDI also
helped keep Senegal’s external position stable. However, real growth has slowed since 2006
when the economy was buffeted by a series of domestic and external shocks (see Box 2) as well
as poor policies that persisted through 2011. Together these have structurally changed the
country’s macro-economic fundamentals and constrained growth.

6

Box 2: Recent Shocks
A series of domestic and external shocks in 2006-2012 stalled per capita GDP growth at 0.7
percent. Poor rains in 2006-2007 led to a fall in agricultural output by about 15 percent in each year,
followed by a spike in food and fuel prices in 2008. These had a major impact on the cost of living,
since Senegal imports 80 percent of its rice and 100 percent of its wheat and fuel oil.
The global financial crisis of 2008-09 revealed Senegal’s significant exposure to the global
recession. Impacts included declines in export demand and prices, tourism, remittances and FDI.
Although this crisis produced a temporary fall in food and fuel prices, the fall was short-lived and in
2010-11 prices rose sharply again. The world slowdown in 2012 has done little to moderate prices.
Floods and droughts in 2009 and 2012 threatened livelihoods. The floods affected some 475,000
people in 2009 and 300,000 in 2012, mainly in the Dakar area. Recent floods have taken a heavy
human and economic toll and affected every part of society. The cost of the 2009 flooding in Senegal
is estimated at US$103 million, including almost US$56 million for damages and US$47 million for
losses; droughts in 2011 resulted in a 20 percent reduction in agricultural output.
Governance shocks weakened institutions and exacerbated the impact of external shocks. There
were frequent changes in the composition of the government (6 Prime Ministers in 12 years and more
frequent changes at Ministerial levels). This weakened the implementation of public policies and
strategies. The ad hoc creation of new autonomous agencies increased significantly after 2000, to the
point where they accounted for some 80 percent of public investment. Without proper oversight
mechanisms, this seriously reduced the monitoring and transparency of public spending. Then in
2008, when the external environment deteriorated, weaknesses in budget management were exposed.
Unplanned spending and tax cuts led to the accumulation of arrears to private suppliers as well as cuts
in priority programs such as vaccinations. An audit in 2009 concluded that cumulative payment
arrears between 2006 and 2008 were equivalent to almost 4 percent of GDP, due primarily to
agencies. Governance problems in the energy sector, resulting in substantial losses and insufficient
private sector investment, hampered the country's ability to cope with rising oil prices.
Political instability in the run up to the 2012 elections and in neighboring countries contributed
to instability. The decision of President Wade to seek a third term, combined with dissatisfaction
over rising prices, power outages, and unemployment, led to occasional riots, uncertainty among
investors, and a weakening of the reform effort. Just as the presidential elections were resolving
matters peacefully, two coups d’états occurred in neighboring Mali and Guinea Bissau. The former is
particularly important economically as Senegal’s largest trading partner and transit destination, while
Guinea Bissau’s instability hampers the resolution of the Casamance crisis.

18.
A weak fiscal policy environment and accelerated recurrent spending during the
2006-2011 period tightened fiscal space and reversed growth. Between 2005 and 2011, the
fiscal deficit increased from 3 percent of GDP to 6.7 percent. Weaknesses in fiscal policy and
PFM, such as the increase of extra budgetary spending via the creation of government agencies,
were compounded by ineffective and untargeted subsidies for electricity and food. The
expansion of current spending during the crises – from 13.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to 18.1
7

percent of GDP in 2011, particularly for transfers, growing debt service and wages – has
significantly limited Government’s space to undertake further stimulus measures as the crises
persist.
19.
Furthermore, as spending and debt grew, interest payments on debt reached the
pre-HIPC level of 1.5 percent of GDP. Poor governance in the energy sector undermined
efficiency and private sector participation in the sector; and repeated injections of public money,
totaling 7 percent of GDP over several years, to fund operations or recapitalize the electric utility
SENELEC have not delivered the expected results. Similarly, in agriculture, non-transparent
bidding processes, poor targeting for agriculture inputs, and untargeted food subsides increased
the costs of other transfers. By 2011, total transfers and subsidies amounted to almost 5 percent
of GDP, leaving no room for additional capital expenditure. To restore growth, the government
will need to reduce its direct interventions in areas where the private sector can do better, such as
energy, agriculture, and telecommunications, and focus on improving the productivity of public
sector spending.

20.
More recently, in 2011, real GDP growth slowed to 2.6 percent, due to continued
energy shortages and a large contraction in agricultural output. While nonagricultural
activities grew by 4.8 percent, agricultural output declined drastically in the fourth quarter, when
more than 50 percent of the annual production is harvested, leading to a fall in annual output of
21 percent. Electricity supply improved in the last semester, thanks to the implementation of the
emergency energy recovery plan. Dynamism in the telecommunication, transport, and financial
sectors contributed to the good performance of the tertiary sector. On the demand side, public
spending, private consumption, and exports were the main drivers of economic growth.
8

21.
The country’s overall external position remained sound but weakened, as the
current account deficit increased. The 2011 current account deficit, including official grants,
widened by two percentage points to 6.4 percent of GDP reflecting the evolution of the trade
balance and remittances.
22.
Macroeconomic performance in 2012 remained weak. Real GDP growth for 2012 has
been revised downward to 3.7 percent (1.1 percent in per capita GDP terms), from 4.4 percent
initially projected, despite an expected agriculture rebound. This revision reflects larger effects
than expected from the 2011 drought, the tense pre-electoral environment, the prolonged euro
crisis, and the political crisis in Mali. In 2012, the current account deficit, including grants, is
projected to widen to about 7.8 percent of GDP due to increased food and infrastructure imports,
while FDI will edge upward.
Medium Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
23.
Over the medium term, Senegal is expected to regain economic momentum and
return to its historical growth trajectory. Growth is projected to accelerate to 5 percent by
2015, the same rate of growth achieved in 2003-07. GDP growth is expected to be driven by
continued momentum in domestic demand, while external demand is expected to build up
gradually as structural constraints are addressed. On the supply side, output growth will be
broad-based, including agriculture, mining, industry and construction, and the services sectors.
The authorities have renewed their commitment to maintaining a prudent fiscal stance over the
medium term by keeping the fiscal deficit below 5 percent in 2013 and below 4 percent in 2015.
The external current account deficit will remain high in the medium term, reflecting mainly
higher imports associated with infrastructure projects and the resumption of growth. For the
medium term, the external current account deficit is projected to gradually decrease but will
remain above 6 percent of GDP until 2015 as the trade balance improves.
24.
Senegal’s public debt has increased steadily in recent years, but the risk of debt
distress remains low.1 The ratio of public debt to GDP is projected to reach 46 percent in 2012,
close to levels that prevailed when Senegal benefited from debt relief under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006. The bulk of public debt is external, i.e., owed to non-residents
of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), although the share of domestic
debt has increased.2 Most of Senegal’s public external debt is on concessional terms. Debt
burden indicators remain well below their thresholds in the baseline scenario, but stress tests lead
to minor breaches of some thresholds. These stress tests highlight the importance of reducing
fiscal deficits and raising growth. The authorities acknowledge that fiscal consolidation and a
cautious approach to non-concessional borrowing are critical for safeguarding debt
sustainability.

Government Program and Development Challenges

Government Program
25.
The newly elected Government has put forward a strong and ambitious SNDES,
intended to put Senegal on an accelerated recovery and growth path that will lead to
higher, stable, and shared growth over the medium to long term. The SNDES builds on two
main documents: the Government’s political program, the Yonnu Yokute; and the joint action
platform of civil society, the Assises Nationales. Yonnu Yokute committed to make Senegal “a
model of efficient governance” and to “break with previous discretionary practices and lack of
transparency.” The new, highly ambitious SNDES program for 2013-2017 outlines a vision of
an emerging nation enjoying solidarity within and between the generations. The program
emphasizes the importance of selectivity, monitoring and evaluation. The priorities are grouped
into a Priority Action Plan linked with the national budget framework. It is clustered around
three broad priority areas:




Growth, Productivity, and Wealth Creation;
Human Capital and Sustainable Development; and
Governance, Institutions, Peace and Security.

26.
The SNDES pillar on Growth, Productivity, and Wealth Creation builds on the
Accelerated Growth Strategy. It envisions a more dynamic export sector, a larger contribution
from agriculture to growth, a more favorable investment climate, and the restructuring of the
electricity sector, built on a sound macroeconomic framework with stronger strategic planning.
Agro-industry, information and communication technology, banking and tourism are singled out
as priority sectors, with particular attention to be given to indigenous small and medium
enterprises. Special emphasis is placed on regional growth poles. Infrastructure investments are
planned in road, rail, air and sea transport infrastructure, including urban transport; along with
attention to trade facilitation along key corridors to support the regional growth poles. The
strategy continues to put as its centerpiece for growth, improvements in the energy sector. It is
estimated that over 150,000 jobs must be created each year to absorb the growing labor force –
and it will have to do more over the long run to reach full employment. While three growth
scenarios are presented, the strategy aims for the most ambitious one, with average GDP growth
of 6.8 percent over the period. Exports of goods and services are expected to grow by 7.5 percent
per annum; and the fiscal deficit is forecast to fall to 3.6 percent by 2017, thanks to rising
revenues, controlled spending, and the utilization of public-private partnerships.
27.
The SNDES pillar on Human Capital and Sustainable Development acknowledges the
essential role of good quality basic social services and emphasizes the links between human
development and growth. Specifically, the strategy aims to improve the quality of services,
governance, and access to basic services, deepen public private partnerships for efficiency and
provide stronger incentives; and put in place a policy and operational framework to strengthen
resilience and social protection for vulnerable groups. The Government intends to create a single
window for universal social protection (Caisse Autonome pour la Protection Sociale Universelle,
CAPSU) that would have responsibility to set up an effective cash transfer and safety net system,
the development of health insurance, and other risk pooling mechanisms. The SNDES also
10

emphasizes the importance of sustainable natural resources management and disaster risk
management as a priority both for income generation and security.
28.
The SNDES program for Governance, Institutions, Peace and Security is a full and
comprehensive agenda which addresses corruption, PFM reforms, monitoring and evaluation,
transparency, peace and resilience, accountability and justice, human rights, and gender equality.
Peace and resilience objectives include resolving the conflict in Casamance and ensuring
enhanced social cohesion through increased decentralizaton. Accountability and human rights
objectives refer to a more ethical and transparent relationship between the state and civil society;
a more effective and equitable justice system; as well as human rights protection and gender
equality. On justice, the objectives for the period 2013-17 include improving access, quality, and
efficiency of justice by reducing the duration of preventive detention; and by strengthening
sanctions against abuses to women, children and minorities. Gender is seen as a cross-cutting
challenge requiring an integrated approach, giving more autonomy to women, promoting
leadership by women, and promoting their role as entrepreneurs. The WBG concurs with the
main development challenges identified in the SNDES.
Governance and Resilience Challenges
29.
The quality of governance in Senegal has been declining since the early 2000s
despite some important advances in procurement and budget preparation reforms.
Senegal’s governance indicators have been declining over the last decade as illustrated by
several international governance indicators. The World Governance Indicators show that 4 out of
6 sub-indicators – Voice and Accountability, Rule of Law, Government Effectiveness, and
Control of Corruption – have declined from a medium level score (50th-75th percentile) to a low
score (25th-50th percentile) since the year 2000. With the Mo Ibrahim Index, Senegal’s overall
governance score also declined between 2006 and 2011 (-3.0) and this decline was the strongest
in WAEMU countries during the period.
30.
The deterioration in governance was manifested in particular by an increase in the
number of arbitrary government decisions and a lack of clarity in the allocation of roles and
responsibilities in the civil service, and of resources, over the last few years. Despite substantial
progress in strengthening the legal and institutional framework for public expenditure and
financial management, the government still needs to finalize the sequencing and
implementation of many aspects of the reforms. On the planning and budgeting front, the link
between sector policies and priorities and the budget is still very weak, in addition to major
capacity constraints in different ministries.

31.
More symptomatic of the lack of a clear legal public administration accountability
framework was the proliferation of agencies. Over 90 percent of current public agencies
(approximately 70) were established by the previous government during the last decade, often
with donor support, and without a law governing agencies (a law was passed in 2009). Often
these agencies had redundant mandates, such as support to youth employment, support to SMEs,
and public investment; the latter being managed by AGEROUTE, APIX, and AGETIP, without
clear rules to allocate public investment projects among these agencies. More importantly,
roughly three-quarters of the investment budget (or about 8 percent of GDP) is executed by these
agencies, thus weakening internal controls and transparency.
Figure 3: Mo Ibrahim Governance Index

32.
During the same period, the independence of the judiciary and other oversight
agencies was frequently undermined. The internal control function exercised by the executive
was weakened by a lack of coordination among the respective inspection agencies at the center
and multiple ministerial agencies. There has also been limited legislative oversight. Although
the parliament approved the Budget Review Acts, the actual budgets for 2008, 2009, and 2010
were only audited in 2011. The findings were not made public, and very few actions have been
taken on the findings and the auditors’ recommendations. In addition, the government stalled
reforms of the Supreme Audit Institutions aimed at enhancing its independence and protecting its
ability to publish reports without presidential authorization. In the area of public procurement,
the former government, in January 2012, adopted a new version of the procurement code,
excluding the operations in the energy sector, without consulting the Authority for the
Regulation of Public Procurement (ARMP) or relying on the participatory process required to
change the code. The challenges regarding access to justice and capacity building of judicial
personnel still need to be addressed.
33.
The new Government is taking action to reverse some of the governance weaknesses
(Box 3). In addition to the measures mentioned above, the Government has restored the public
procurement code to its original form, is taking steps to strengthen the financial management of
universities, is launching the process of evaluation of public agencies, is improving personnel
management in education through reinforcing the “deconcentration” process, and has launched a
civil service audit. However, more remains to be done.

13

Box 3: An Agenda for Improved Governance and Accountability:
Reforms introduced by the new government

Code of Transparency. A law has been submitted to the Parliament to adopt the WEAMU code of
transparency, which will trigger the adoption of a law for asset declaration and the financing of
political parties, and enhanced disclosure of budgetary information. An initial asset declaration was
made by the President and two members of Government immediately after the elections.
Enhanced independence of the Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). A draft organic law for the SAI
(Cour des Comptes) has been approved by the Council of Ministers to strengthen its financial
independence and authority to publish reports without the ex-ante agreement of the executive. The
government also decided to conduct a comprehensive audit of public accounts.
Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative and Justice Sector. The Ministry of Justice initiated a process of
stolen asset recovery and is planning to improve justice effectiveness and equity.
Les Assises Nationales and dialogue with civil society and the legislature. Building on the
campaign commitment to consult civil society, the President, in September 2012, launched a forum
on the role of Constitutional Institutions in democratic governance, to reflect in particular on the
respective roles of the executive and the legislature in Senegal. Members of Parliament, unions,
academics, and representatives of government are involved in this forum.

34.
Strengthening public sector accountability and performance is important for
building a strong state that is politically, socially and economically resilient. Maintaining
the capital of civil society trust gained during elections is critical for the Government. This could
be achieved through a public administration able to effectively plan, manage human and
financial resources, and monitor activities. This would allow for more effective service delivery
and the implementation of economic policies, as well as the transparency and judiciary reforms
planned by the government.
35.
Poor governance and weak institutions are also exacerbating the problems of shocks
and natural disaster management. Senegal is facing increasing climate change challenges.
While climate science uncertainty makes it difficult to accurately predict the effects of climate
change, there is an emerging consensus that the future outlook for Senegal may include
considerable increases in the length and intensity of droughts.
36.
Senegal’s most valuable natural capital – land – is at risk. In Senegal, soil related
natural capital is an important engine of long-term growth, and it is worth US$1,272 per capita
compared with per capita income of US$1,080. Agricultural land accounts for 63 percent of
natural wealth; while forest assets, including timber and non-timber resources, account for 30
percent. Preventing further land degradation could save over 4.5 percent of GDP; currently, land
degradation affects approximately 2.5 million hectares, about 34% of the land area. Drivers of
land degradation include land clearing for agriculture and wood energy collection.

14

37.
Climate change has influenced and will continue to negatively influence the
availability of water resources, agriculture and coastal zones.3 Drought affects mainly arid
and semi-arid Sahelian areas in the northern part of Senegal. From 1977 to 2002, the country
experienced six years of major shocks in terms of rainfall, characterized by late arrival of rains,
irregular spatial distribution, and an early end of the rainy season.4 The rising sea level and
coastal erosion threatens the 74 percent of households in Senegal that live in coastal areas, and
the economic activities that they undertake in the fishing, tourism, and agriculture sectors. This
requires better management of water resources, including the revitalization of the Senegal river
basin and protection of available water reserves, and a strengthening of the fight against drought
and desertification with the use of appropriate agriculture technologies. Recent floods have taken
a heavy human and economic toll in peri-urban Dakar.
38.
Despite the efforts and progress made to build resilience, a number of institutional
and governance challenges still need to be addressed. The Disaster and Risk Management
(DRM) mechanism is not fully successful due to the complexity and lack of clarity of the
institutional and governance arrangements, and the weakness of the supporting legal, regulatory
and operational mechanisms. There are weaknesses in: vulnerability and risk assessments and
evaluation of potential effects and impacts on the population, infrastructure and assets; and
stakeholders’ lack of knowledge of the current DRM organization and of possible key
contributions from their side on preparation, emergency and recovery. In addition, the
Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC)’s current structure and profile are weak and thus constrain
its ability to coordinate, mobilize and facilitate interventions. Finally, local DRM is still weak as
decentralizing of DRM capacities and resources to local authorities has been slow. Defining the
responsibilities of all stakeholders, strengthening their capacity to successfully implement
changes, and increase the awareness of other stakeholders are crucial needs.
39.
In the Casamance Region, where the threat of natural and economic shocks is
aggravated by social and political unrest, the government will have to build a stronger state
presence and strengthen the social contract between the state and the people by: improving the
effectiveness of the local governments (ARDs) with respect to delivering services, including
security, and working with the private sector to create jobs and improve the livelihood of the
population, especially for women and youth.
Private sector challenges
40.
Most of the much needed job creation will have to come from the private sector as
the state cannot sustainably create stable and secure jobs. In Senegal, in addition to
traditional artisanal and agricultural activities, the private sector is composed of a modern formal
sector and an informal sector. In the first half of the 2000s, the Senegalese private sector
included about 1700 modern formal firms. Nearly 56 percent of these firms operated in services
and 43 percent in industry. However, the ability of this private sector to generate growth and
employment is undermined by a weak investment climate; and economic sectors are not growing

15

or expanding fast enough to absorb the growing labor force. Data show that besides public
administration, the main sectors contributing to growth in Senegal are the telecommunications
sector, commerce, construction, financial services, real estate, agriculture, energy and livestock.
Agriculture, while it contributes only 3 percent to growth, employs over 60 percent of the
population; however, over 75 percent of the jobs in this sector are not secure. In the fisheries
sector, another high employment sector that employs 28 percent of the poor, over a third of the
jobs are not stable.
41.
Overall, the private sector’s role in stimulating the economy has been limited due to
a weak investment climate underpinned by weak governance systems and poor
implementation of reforms. Senegal’s private sector activity has deteriorated since the mid2000s, as evidenced by the country’s export performance. Exports as a percentage of GDP went
from 31 percent to 24.5 percent of GDP between 1995 and 2010. Although the export basket of
the country has moved away from its former exclusive reliance on Europe due to increased intraregional trade, Senegal still has a relatively high concentration of exports. The top five
destination markets in 2011, which accounted for almost 50% of total exports, were: Mali
(15.8%), India (14.8%), Switzerland (9.2%), Guinea (4.8%), and France (4.6%), making Senegal
vulnerable to specific shocks. The top foreign exchange earners are tourism, followed by exports
of fish products, petroleum oils, phosphoric acid, gold and cement.
42.
The private sector in Senegal faces a number of constraints. Some of Senegal’s key
weaknesses in terms of global competitiveness (Figure 4) include infrastructure (especially the
quality of electricity supply), higher education and training (especially enrollment in tertiary
education and staff training), innovation and technological readiness (capacity for innovation,
patents, internet bandwidth), and institutions (business environment). The most important
constraints for doing business include infrastructure (mainly electricity), access to finance and
taxation, both in terms of rate and regulations.

43.
The high cost of energy (Table 3), coupled with unreliable supply (especially for
electricity), is a key constraint to private sector growth and also contributes to
undermining the fiscal framework. The challenge for Senegal is to ensure a competitive supply
of electricity in the industrial zones and agricultural areas that have the greatest potential. The
electricity sector requires rehabilitation and modernization to cope with a demand that increases
by about 10 percent per year. In 2010, power outages occurred 270 days out of 365, with the
impact of these outages on economic growth as high as 1.4 percentage points of GDP. In
addition, load shedding worsened in 2011, with about 250 GWh of undistributed energy,
representing 11 percent of total electricity sales. Investment projects to diversify the energy mix
away from oil were conceived as early as the mid-2000s, but have not yet materialized.
Table 3: Average price of electricity in US cents per kWh

44.
Senegal will need to diversify its energy mix, including by attracting private sector
investments and improving sector governance. Senegal’s heavy dependence on imported oil
products for its energy supply has hurt its competitiveness, weakened its fiscal framework, and
continues to severely undermine growth. Investments in the sector over the last five years have
been inefficient and have crowded out other more productive expenditures and investments.
45.
On the infrastructure and logistics front, Senegal’s road infrastructure lags behind
the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, and Senegal is not well connected to its neighbors or to its
interior regions. With a network of 14,850 km of classified roads, out of which 5,500 are
paved, the density of road infrastructure in Senegal is relatively low. The percentage of paved
roads in good or fair condition (59%) is also below SSA average, while the Rural Access Index
percentage of rural people who live within two kilometers (typically equivalent to a 20-25
minute walk) of an all-season road is around 29%, compared to 34% for low-income SSA
countries. On the rail front, the rail line between Bamako and Dakar (1233 km) is in poor
condition and needs urgent rehabilitation. Demand for the rail is high: in 2010, traffic was about
440,000 tons, with a modal share of about 52% for containers, in spite of the current condition of
the line. In terms of urban transport, an urban transport policy promoting modal shift from cars to
quality public transport services is required to solve the congestion issue in a sustainable way.
46.
Firms also complain about the high cost of credit, the high collateral requirements,
and the fact that banks are reluctant to take risks. Access to finance is among the top three
constraints to doing business for the Senegalese private sector. On the supply side, the
Senegalese financial system seems to have difficulties in responding to the firms’ financing
needs. Credit to the private sector (25.9 percent of GDP in 2010) is 2.5 times less than the SSA
average and is 5.5 times lower than in South Africa. Lack of long-term financing is also a big
issue in most of the CFA region.

17

47.
On the sector front, telecommunications, the sector contributing the most to growth,
continues to face serious challenges. According to recent WB analysis, not only is the quality
of Senegal’s telecom services lagging behind the region, but also costs are higher in comparison
to other countries. Numerous studies show that a 10 percent increase in ICT penetration can
increase GDP growth by 0.25 percent to 1.5 percent. Despite a current mobile penetration rate of
about 67 percent, Senegal foregoes efficiencies and cost-saving opportunities by under-using
ICTs and the existing telecommunications infrastructure as a platform for service delivery due to
the poor regulatory and competitive environment. The mining sector, another potential growth
sector, contributes about 0.5 percent to growth and is expected to grow over time. In tandem
with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process, Senegal needs to review its
fiscal regime in order to optimize expected revenues from operations and create jobs.
48.
Agriculture remains a key sector of the Senegalese economy and a lever to activate
for inclusive growth, food security, employment and poverty reduction. The agriculture
sector employs over 60 percent of the population, of which 60 percent are women. About 70
percent of the rural population depends on agriculture or activities related to agriculture for their
livelihood. However, agriculture and livestock-raising contributes modestly to GDP, with a rate
varying of 10-12 percent. The gap between the share of agriculture in the GDP and the share of
agriculture in the labor force highlights the low performance of the sector.
49.
At the same time, Senegal has a number of attributes that make it an attractive
location for investment in agriculture and agri-business. It is economically and politically
stable. The climate is ideal for off-season horticulture and it has good logistics for serving
European markets. Domestic food markets are likely to expand with continued urbanization, and
there is substantial scope for import substitution. Existing productivity is low, suggesting the
potential for large returns if yields can be increased with better access to land, improved fertilizer
use, improved seeds, increased mechanization, and increase in the hectares irrigated to permit
more planting periods. Inputs distribution mechanisms must also be improved for more efficient
targeting and traceability of beneficiaries. Farmers need better access to finance and insurance
mechanisms to help with droughts. The Government has recently completed a national
agricultural sector investment plan under the umbrella of The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Program (CAADP), which recognizes these challenges and opportunities of the sector.
50.
More than 600,000 people in Senegal are estimated to be directly or indirectly
employed in the fisheries sector, representing nearly 15 percent of the active labor force.
From 2007 to 2011 the average total of fish product exports was about US$226 million, roughly
18 percent of total exports by value. However, as the fishing fleet has grown and high-value
catches have stagnated, the economic returns have dwindled; and 37.4 percent of fishermen live
below the poverty line. Governance reforms to reduce open access to resources could rebuild the
fisheries as a future source of growth.
51.
Finally, Senegal needs to close its skills gap to increase competitiveness and
productivity. Recent studies in Senegal on the business climate, as well as cross-country data,
point to a large education and skill gap as a main constraint to raising productivity and
transitioning towards a more competitive and dynamic economy. Of the population aged 15-59,
18

only 15.5 percent had received technical or vocational training. For many enterprises, there is a
gap between the demand and the supply of skills; only 28 percent of firms in the TVET survey
were able to find either the specialization or certification level they were seeking.
52.

On gender, Senegal is making progress but more improvement is needed (Box 4).
Box 4: Senegal Gender Update

In 2011, women represented 52% of the total population of Senegal, but were only 23% of the
representatives in the Parliament, approximately 10% of the government officials, 13% of regional council
members, 20% of municipal council members and 27% of rural council members. In 2011 Senegal’s Global
Gender Gap Index ranking was 0.6573, placing it 92nd of 135 countries. In 2012 Senegal has made great
progress. A new gender equality parity law was passed applying to Parliament and all elected representation,
national or local. Thanks to this law, Senegal moved up the Social Institutions and Gender Index
classification from 52/102 in 2009, to 41/86 in 2012. In education, gender parity has already been attained at
the primary and junior secondary levels. Girls’ enrolment and completion rates are currently higher than that
of boys’. With the recent trends, it is likely that the gender gap will close in upper secondary by the end of the
CPS period.
However, the agriculture sector is considerably unequal. Women have unequal access to land, inputs,
finance and mechanized techniques. Access to these inputs will help women increase productivity and
incomes and invest more in their children’s’ education, and improve health outcomes. Evidence has shown
that agricultural production can be improved through equal access to production factors for men and women
(Alderman et al., 1995; Quisumbing, 2003; Koopman, 2009; Niane, 2010). In Senegal, a National Strategy
for Gender Equity and Equality (SNEEG) has been developed in order to promote gender equality. The CPS
will draw upon this work.
The CPS would put a special focus on issues of women’s access to land, inputs (seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides), credit, extension services, and labor-saving technologies such as improved irrigation equipment.
The CPS also focuses on women’s access to energy through its energy portfolio. The social protection and
health programs also pay particular attention to gender equity issues.
Examples of Gender focus in WB-financed projects.
The Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Project has contributed to gender equality by
putting into place the Producer Organizations’ Local Consultation Forums, some of which are led by women
who focus on helping other women benefit from the project.
The Sustainable Land Management Project supports women in requesting land ownership rights from some
rural communities. The introduction of technologies, such as planting of fruit trees by women, has led to such
changes in land tenure. Moreover, the diffusion of technologies responding to gender-specific needs like
improved stoves and biogas from manure has reduced the daily work load of wood collection.
The Water and Sanitation Millennium project works with women to ensure transparency in project
implementation. Rural water schemes are managed at the community level by water users’ associations that
fully take into account the gender dimension. At least one third of members must be women.
The Second Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management project requires (i) gender parity in local
management committees and project beneficiaries; and (ii) inclusion of women in profitable charcoal
production value chain activities from which they were previously largely excluded. As a result, women in
project areas have not only contributed to the sustainable management of forest resources, but have also
realized increased incomes.

Service delivery challenges
53.
Poor expenditure management hinders performance in education. Education
expenditures represent 6.2 percent of GDP (1.2 percent for higher education) and 32 percent of
total government expenditures; 90 percent of the education budget is for salaries, of which 28
percent is for sector staff not teaching; 62 percent of the higher education budget is for
scholarships and social costs. Improving the transparency and efficiency of expenditure
management, especially the wage bill, is crucial to financing the expansion of the system and
improving the quality of student learning. The Government carried out personnel audits in 2003,
2006 and 2007 and weeded out large numbers of ghost and non-teaching teachers, but the
problems persist. Improving learning outcomes for all students, for example, will require greater
focus on improving the accountability for results, improving teacher behavior in classes and their
pedagogic techniques, providing incentives, and improving learning conditions.
54.
Expenditure in health is poorly targeted and inefficient. The government spent six
percent of the budget on health expenditures in 2010, with 79 percent going to hospitals and
central administration and only 21 percent being allocated for basic care and public health
services. Health indicators are slightly better in Senegal than the averages for Sub-Saharan
Africa. However, the share of the budget allocated to the sector over the past five years remains
low, and efficiency of expenditures is weak. One survey estimated that medical staff spent only
39 minutes per day attending to patients. The hospital sub-sector still absorbs a high proportion
of the health budget and, in 2009, started to “crowd out” health investments. Health policies and
programs provide for some essential preventive and curative interventions, but financial
protection for the poor against the burdens of illness is limited. Also weak accountability
mechanisms in the health system still prevent major improvements in maternal and reproductive
health. Consequently, results achieved on health indicators are mixed.
55.
To release more resources for pro-poor health services, the authorities will need to
reduce the heavy burden of hospital debt. A 2007 study estimated that a quarter of hospital
resources (mainly staff) made no contribution to hospital outputs. As a result, most hospitals in
Dakar are virtually bankrupt and rely heavily on exceptional subsidies provided by the
Government. Funding available for investments has now almost entirely shifted to cover
hospitals’ financial losses. To regain its investment capacity, the Government must restore its
oversight of hospitals, especially with regard to their recruitment and compensation policies and
budgets.
56.
Budget allocations for the water and sanitation sector do not correspond to the
needs and the capacity within the sector to deliver quality services. The urban sanitation
sector has been unable to achieve a performance similar to urban water (over 98 percent access).
Only 63.3 percent (end of 2011) of urban households have access to sanitation services. The
sanitation sector suffers from a lack of financial resources as it is funded solely by the license fee
levied for sanitation through water bills in cities and is insufficient to meet the expenses of the
ONAS.

20

57.
Social protection programs as a share of GDP are growing but targeting is poor and
needs improvements. There are about a dozen existing safety net programs, from school
lunches, food assistance, and targeted support to the elderly and disabled, to two pilot conditional
cash transfer schemes. Together, they reach less than 1 million people, not counting general
cereal distribution through the Food Security Commissariat. This represents only a small fraction
of the poor in Senegal. Moreover, the programs are spread across various ministries with
different targeting methodologies and systems for identifying beneficiaries. The Government is
well aware that Senegal needs safety net programs that can address existing chronic poverty as
well as the vulnerable who will continue to face shocks. The President has appointed a Delegué
General for Social Protection reporting directly to the President. However, his role and
responsibilities for setting strategies, coordinating programs, and establishing the Caisse
Autonome pour la Protection Sociale Universal (CAPSU) has not been formalized.
58.
According to the 2010 Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) report; absenteeism is
widespread. On average, 20% of staff are absent from duty in health facilities, and competence
is very low. Absenteeism is also high in schools. The SDI shows that on any day, 18% of
teachers are absent, and even when in school, 29% of teachers are not in the class. Insufficient
training may not be the only explanation for this low performance. Finally, there are very few
accountability mechanisms to ensure that service providers are responsible for their performance.
The Country Partnership Strategy FY07-10
59.
The FY 2007-2010 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was based on the
government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) covering 2006-2010. The PRSP
vision was articulated around four pillars5: (i) wealth creation; (ii) access to basic social services;
(iii) protection of vulnerable groups; and (iv) greater transparency and participatory processes.
The strategy emphasized the need to encourage private sector led growth and to expand and
diversify exports in order to achieve 7-8 percent growth rates over the medium term.
60.
The activities of the 2007-2010 CAS were clustered around three pillars and one
cross-sector governance filter. The three pillars were: (i) fostering economic growth through
support to private sector development; (ii) improving human development through better
delivery of social services, notably to the most vulnerable groups; and (iii) enhancing rural and
urban synergies. Transparency was to be mainstreamed in all programs and projects supported by
the CAS to help improve public and private governance. The Government and the World Bank
Group (WBG) shared a common vision of the overall objectives to be achieved. The 2007-2010
CAS thus aimed at supporting Senegal's PRSP-II with the ultimate objective of attaining the
MDGs.
61.
The 2007-2010 CAS lending program was based on a total envelope of IDA
resources of US$420 million over four years. During the CAS period, the Bank prepared and
disbursed a total of 17 operations and one additional financing for a total of nearly US$690
5

The first three pillars were already included in the first PRSP (2003-2005), while the last one emerged as a new
priority for the authorities.

21

million, of which US$590 million was financed by IDA. The higher than forecast program was
largely due to unanticipated financing needs in response to the different crises. The program
included three development policy operations financed by IDA and totaling US$123 million, and
four trust-funded operations totaling US$100 million.6 In addition, US$471 million in IDA was
disbursed during the period, and an additional US$170 million from FY11-FY12.
62.
The Bank’s teams and management paid strong attention to implementation
support as shown by the quality of the portfolio, with only one out of 16 active operations
being at risk at the time of the writing of this document. Overall supervision of execution of the
program was strengthened through continued decentralization of implementation to the Dakar
office. Seven out of the 29 non-DPL operations under implementation during the CAS period
were restructured to improve effectiveness. However, M&E was weak in a number of
operations, and special efforts to correct this were undertaken with the 2009 and recent 2012
CPPRs.
63.
The CAS was supported by a strong program of AAA. Sixteen pieces of ESW were
delivered, along with two TA activities. This included a country economic memorandum, a
poverty assessment, a multi-sector public expenditure review, and a country environmental
assessment. Three smaller pieces of ESW, planned in the later years of the CAS, were dropped;
but they were replaced by three others. The initial projections for delivery tended to be overly
optimistic, so many products slipped by a year.
Lessons Learned
64.
A number of lessons emerge from the last CAS completion report. First, Bank
performance is strongest in areas of sustained engagement. Long term involvement in one
area – spanning two to three CAS periods – delivers good results. This is the case for the
activities in the road and education sectors. This argues in favor of the Bank pursuing its
engagement in a number of areas where much remains to be done and it has a long history of
engagement, such as in water, PFM reform and energy. Since the Bank is generally perceived as
an “honest broker,” many donors are more willing to engage in a sector when the Bank is
involved; and this can also increase leverage for change.
65.
Budget support has continued to be an effective tool to mobilize the entire
Government on key reforms, but the objectives have to be realistic and the government
commitment to reforms is a determinant factor for its success. The reforms promoted in the
road maintenance fund, FERA, the sustainable management of fisheries, and the recruitment of
education personnel demonstrated increased mobilization and greater involvement of the line
ministries and smoother relations between the Ministry of Finance and line ministries. But
successful DPOs need to be supported by government’s willingness to reform and underpinned
by solid analytical work; and in the case of multi-sectoral DPOs, synergies with sector SIL/TA
operations significantly increase their impact. A combination of several instruments is advisable,
6

One operation, the Sustainable Management of Fish Resources project, received a blend of IDA and GEF
financing.

22

especially in strategically selected areas of intervention. An example of an unsuccessful DPO
was the Senegal energy DPO where the Bank and the government failed in their attempt to
implement reforms. The ICR of the DPO concluded that in future it would be important to use a
longer series of DPOs with more modest objectives, and greater flexibility, supported by an
investment credit. Greater ownership at the sector level and better coordination between the
sector and finance ministry, as well as within the Bank, would also be critical (see Annex 10).
66.
The number of institutions needed for and benefitting from project implementation
needs to be limited. One key lesson emerging from the private sector development project
(PIPP) is that project design should be kept simple, in line with local administrative capabilities.
The initial PIPP design included 19 beneficiaries and a large number of structural reforms to
improve the overall investment climate, both at a general level and at the level of specific and
disparate sectors (postal sector, tourism, royalties in the music industry). Coordination was
difficult, with negative implications for implementation.

III.

The Country Partnership Strategy FY13 - FY17

67.
This CPS comes at a time when Senegal has just moved into Middle Income
Country status. The level of engagement between the WBG and the GoS has evolved over time
into one of real partnership, which this CPS intends to build on. The preparation of the CPS
benefited from intense consultation with the government technical and policy staff, culminating
in consultations with over three-quarters of the cabinet. This CPS builds on a shared
understanding of the development challenges in Senegal and the strengths of the WBG in
designing the support program. In this regard, the CPS aims to focus its intervention on a few
key areas, building on past work but also putting particular emphasis on building and
strengthening the implementation capacity of the government.
68.
With limited IDA resources and lack of fiscal space on the government side, the CPS
intends to heavily leverage private sector and other regional and trust fund resources. As
growth picks up, IFC and MIGA financing should increase as the role of the private sector
grows. Thus, the CPS sets out a framework where the Bank’s support becomes a leveraging
mechanism for improving government-wide development outcomes both in the private and
public sector.
Selectivity and Program Design
69.
The CPS will focus on areas that are acknowledged as key constraints to development
by the Government and people of Senegal, where the WBG has a comparative advantage,
where there is a window of opportunity for reform, and where Government and/or the private
sector and other donors seek to work in partnership with the WBG. The application of these
selectivity criteria will help to focus our engagement and build stronger teams for results. The
CPS proposes fewer, more cross-sectoral, and larger operations, and will favor additional
financing, as recommended by the last CR, except in a few areas where we are building the
dialogue anew.

23

70.
The CPS strategy will draw on the full menu of Bank instruments to ensure
sufficient flexibility in the design and close alignment with government priorities and
processes. The CPS will begin exploring ways to build capacity within the government to
execute its programs. Instruments such as the Program for Results (P4R) will be proposed to
government, as appropriate.
71.
The Bank’s strategy is to build better national institutions that are more effective,
can combat corruption challenges, and can mitigate fiduciary risks for all public money,
including the Bank’s. The authorities have expressed the need not to have separate FM systems
for each donor support project; and a review of the use of country FM system for investment
operations financed by the Bank will be conducted. Through strategic use of PIUs to focus on
improving the capacity of ministries and central systems, the Bank expects to help improve the
efficiency of all government expenditures, not just the use of the funds provided by the Bank.
72.
Senegal’s IDA16 allocation is SDR310.2 million (US$466 million equivalent).7 Of
these resources, US$160 million were committed to operations during FY12. The remaining
resources will be used to leverage additional resources from IFC and Trust Funds in order to
maximize impact during the next two years. In addition to the IDA 16 allocation, the team hopes
to leverage an additional US$132 million from the private sector in collaboration with the IFC
and from other Trust funds.
73.
IFC's current committed portfolio in Senegal, as of 30 September 2012, was US$98
million invested in 12 companies, composed of six loans, six equity investments and two
guarantees. In order to further promote private sector development as part of the CPS agenda,
IFC seeks to: (i) increase access to finance for SMEs and microenterprise through financial
intermediaries, with the provision of investment and advisory services; (ii) support the private
provision of infrastructure with a focus on power and transportation; (iii) support the
agribusiness value chain both directly and through financial intermediaries, and (iv) help GoS to
regain the momentum it has built up in the past in terms of business environment improvement.
IFC will also continue engaging with the GoS to strengthen the PPP framework through capacity
building initiatives and best practice PPP transactions in key sectors such as health, education
and/or sanitation. In advisory services, IFC had eight active programs in Senegal during FY12,
including capacity building to MSMEs via the rollout of the Business Edge and SME Toolkit
products, and increased access to finance to MSMEs via support to banks and microfinance
clients.

7

The current estimate of the IDA envelope is based on available resources from the IDA16 replenishment and is
updated annually based on the respective country allocation parameters. The final allocations have been firmed up
for FY12-13, while the allocations for FY14 are indicative as they may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources
available; (ii) the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance
(grants/credits), and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone; (iv) the
performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of
IDA-eligible countries. IDA allocations are provided in SDR terms. While the US dollar equivalent amount is
provided at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR, the exchange rate for each operation depends on the applicable
prevailing rate at the time of approval.

24

74.
As of September 30, 2012, MIGA’s gross exposure in Senegal was US$165.5 million,
equivalent to 9 percent of MIGA’s portfolio in SSA and 30 percent in West Africa (Côte
d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali). This exposure is largely concentrated in
infrastructure, with over US$156 million in exposure.
CPS Program and Results
75.
The CPS is fully aligned with the government’s program and is designed to support
implementation of core areas of the government’s SNDES program where the WBG has a
comparative advantage. The CPS, which is fully consistent with IFC’s strategic priorities, will
be anchored on one foundation and will include two focused pillars:




Foundation: Strengthening the governance framework and building resilience
Pillar 1: Accelerating inclusive growth and creating employment
Pillar 2: Improving service delivery.

76.
All activities in the CPS will contain a gender component, making gender an
integrated consideration in all lending and advisory activities. Furthermore, the projects done
under this CPS will have clear gender disaggregated indicators, where available and relevant,
and will target gender-disadvantaged groups when appropriate.
77.
CPS activities will also involve civil society in a proactive way, particularly to
support their role in governance and resilience. CPS activities will rely on supporting the
governance dialogue between civil society, political authorities, and the public administration.
This will be achieved through: (i) proactive information dissemination; and (ii) civil society
involvement in M&E activities. The CPS will build on the Global Partnership for Social
Accountability to help broaden accountability of public institutions at the country level.
Foundation: Improving governance and strengthening resilience
78.
The CPS interventions under this pillar will be foundational; they will primarily
focus on building governance systems and processes to enhance the predictability,
credibility and accountability of the government across the public and private sector and civil
society. Drawing from a number of diagnostic studies, the CPS approach is focused on
strengthening Government capacity to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate policy
implementation and priority setting. If successful, this will form the basis for improved
transparency and accountability for results. The Senegal CPS approach to governance is
consistent with the Bank’s Updated GAC (see Annex 7).

79.
In addition, the CPS will begin to focus on specific activities in the area of Disaster
Risk and Sustainable Land Management as foundations for building resilience. The country
particularly needs to build resilience for reducing vulnerabilities to disasters that affect a sector’s
26

investments as well as its development efforts. The series of recent shocks experienced by
Senegal have contributed to slowed growth and the stalling of poverty reduction. All activities in
the upcoming CPS period will be focused on the goal of mitigating potential shocks in order to
enhance resilience against future events. Therefore, the CPS proposes to contribute to the
country’s resilience by supporting the development of government wide systems and processes
for identifying and managing risks, i.e., building a disaster risk management framework – with
particular emphasis on a few sectors such as agriculture, forest management, transport, health,
and nutrition.
80.
(outcome 1) Improved public sector accountability. Overall public sector performance
remains limited in terms of service delivery, policy implementation, and fiscal management. The
CPS has a strong program on governance that is underpinned by policy dialogue and actions
presented in the three-year programmatic budget support (DPO) series - the Growth and
Governance Support Credits (GGSC). Beyond this policy support to governance, the CPS
addresses challenges in specific public sector functions; in particular, PFM, Monitoring &
Evaluation, Debt Management and Monitoring of Agencies, all of which affect public sector
performance.
Analytical Work and Technical Assistance


Public Sector Performance AAA: Strengthening public sector accountability and building
resilient governance systems and processes to measure and monitor performance is critical to
ensure an open dialogue between civil society and the Government and to support inclusive
growth and greater prosperity for all. This needs good budget processes, Planning, and
Monitoring & Evaluation systems. This study will support the government’s strategy to
improve overall public and civil service reform.



Stolen Assets Recovery Program Technical Assistance: As part of their efforts to improve
governance and accountability, and fight corruption, the authorities have requested the
assistance of the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative. Going forward, the support provided by
StAR will be three-pronged:
 Improve the legal and institutional framework to tackle the proceeds of corruption (and
use anti-money laundering tools to prevent, detect and prosecute the concealment of the
proceeds of corruption). This approach brings together two of Senegal's priorities under
the SNDES (see para 43), with a focus on bolstering the organization of the criminal
justice system and improving domestic coordination between the relevant stakeholders so
as to effectively use these tools. This assistance will focus in particular on the creation of
poles of expertise on financial crime in the judiciary.
 Strengthen the capacity of practitioners (financial intelligence unit, financial
investigators, and prosecution) to go after the proceeds of crime, in particular all forms of
corruption.

27

 Facilitate Senegal's efforts on active corruption cases to recover the stolen assets, notably
by assisting Senegal to seek and receive international cooperation and mutual legal
assistance to this end.
 This assistance aims at building up the capacity of Senegal to effectively go after corrupt
officials, which is also expected to build up incentives in favor of good governance and
accountability on the preventive side. StAR engagement – which could lead to further
engagement with Senegal on its broader AML/CFT agenda – would also contribute to
and benefit from synergies with Bank assistance on Justice Reform, financial and private
sector development, the “illicit flows agenda,” and economic governance.


Land Governance Assessment Framework: The absence of a clear legal framework on access
to land, especially for women, is impeding effective and efficient development of private
sector activity in a key sector for growth, including in projects of the WBG group, and
continues to be a source of graft and corruption. The Land Governance Assessment
Framework study is a multi-sector exercise to help the government develop an effective and
appropriately sequenced policy framework.



A procurement value chain analysis: Building on the government’s positive decision to reinstate the procurement code and improve transparency of the procurement process, this
study will: (i) identify bottlenecks in the chain of the procurement process and contract
execution; and (ii) work with Government to implement recommendations to accelerate
implementation of the national budget, projects and programs.
Projects



A Governance and Public Financial Management project with a Public Sector Performancebased Component and additional financing for the Public Financial Management and
Systems, which will support the implementation of selected national programs and provide
technical assistance to the strengthening of the government capacity to monitor results and
progress at ministerial and center of government levels, and to link the monitoring function
with decision making. The project will also assist the Government in strengthening public
financial management and systems, and strengthening the procurement system, including
regional mandates such as WAEMU directives.
 In addition to support on debt management TA, the Bank, through the above mentioned
Governance and Public Financial Management Project, is considering a request to
support the authorities in the following areas: (i) incorporating cost-effective options to
tackle rollover risk of the government debt management strategy; (ii) executing the
strategy in the external market – in particular, selecting the lead manager and
implementing currency swaps; and (iii) designing and implementing a plan to improve
the functioning of the primary market and to boost the secondary market.



In addition, the three-year programmatic budget support (DPO) series – the Growth and
Governance Support Credits (GGSC) – will support the overall Government program of
28

governance and public sector reforms at the center of Government and the Ministry of
Finance, as well as in the education, health, and energy sectors (see Table 4).
81.
(outcome 2) Sustainable land and water management. The downward trend in
rainfall observed since the 50s, and the increased frequency of droughts,8 combined with
population growth, has resulted in increasing impacts from droughts and floods. Senegal, in
addition, ranks 9th on the world list of countries with the largest share of the population living in
low elevation coastal zones. The CPS will assist the government in mainstreaming Disaster Risk
Management by improving the governance and institutional framework.
Analytical and Advisory Activities


Prepare a master plan for stormwater drainage as a planning tool for spatial and temporal
interventions.



Undertake Analytical work on institutional setting for risk management agencies and
mainstreaming of risk management across government. There are too many agencies
involved in disaster response and this often leads to ineffective coordination within the
agency, lack of accountability, and misuse of funds. The study will propose options for
rationalizing the agencies responsible for improving Senegal’s resilience to natural shocks.

82.
(outcome 3) Improved drainage and flood prevention in selected urban areas. As a
result of enduring internal migration, over 48 percent of Senegal's population lives in the urban
areas and over 76 percent of this urban population lives in areas classified as slums, which are
very flood and disease prone. The Bank will support the government’s efforts to improve its
response to natural disasters and protect the livelihood of urban and peri-urban residents.
Analytical and Advisory Activities


Develop a primary drainage framework and system for stormwater in priority areas of the
periphery of Dakar.



Under The Storm Water Management Climate Change adaptation project, the CPS will
undertake an urban planning and flood risk mapping study to support prevention and
mitigation, strengthen flood disaster risk management mechanisms, and improve the
awareness and education efforts of affected communities.
Project

 The storm water management and climate change adaptation project will be scaled-up. In
Dakar, these needs will be identified through the Drainage Master Plan (PDA) and will
include building drainage systems to help mitigate flood risks. IDA will continue taking a
leadership role in order to help mitigate fiscal risks associated with the country’s natural
disaster risk profile.



The GFDRR funded Disaster Risk Management project will strengthen the overall DRM
institutional framework and coordination mechanism. The ongoing first phase (GFDRR:
US$1.1 m) focuses on flood early warning, preparation and response. The forthcoming
second phase (GFDRR: US$3.6 m) will broaden the DRM framework, promote a multihazard risk management approach, and pay particular attention to coastal zones that are
especially vulnerable due to their high exposure to natural hazards and their high
socioeconomic and naturalistic value.

83.
(outcome 4) Reduce the vulnerability of the population in the Casamance region.
Casamance is a growth pole for Senegal due to its strong agriculture, aquaculture and tourism
potential. However, persistent conflict and lack of economic opportunity continue to undermine
its potential to contribute to growth. The Bank, in close collaboration with other donors active in
Casamance (USAID/MCA, AfDB, French Cooperation, Dutch Cooperation, and UNDP), will
support the implementation of a comprehensive project to address issues of economic
empowerment.


The US$40 million Casamance growth pole project will provide income generation
opportunities, particularly for youth and women in targeted areas of the Casamance region.

Pillar 1: Accelerating inclusive growth and creating employment
84.
The World Bank Group will support the Government’s efforts to accelerate growth
and create jobs, including through creating more fiscal space for improved macroeconomic
stability, more FDI and an improved business environment. In doing so, the WBG will build
on past achievements and knowledge of the economy, but, more importantly, will seek to
accompany the Government in implementing the SNDES. Given fiscal constraints, the thrust of
work will focus on activities which help reduce pressure on government spending by further
involving the private sector. This approach, coupled with support to the government to improve
the overall business environment, should lead to a drop in government expenditures in sectors
such as agriculture, energy and transport, and to an improved macro-economic and fiscal
framework. Increased private sector activity would in turn underpin job creation over the
medium term. The key challenge of this pillar will be to get the state to be less involved in some
activities by working with IFC and providing credible private sector investment options. The IFC
will therefore have a key role and will lead the dialogue in some areas. In addition, the WBG will
attempt to crowd in MIGA involvement.
85.
(outcome 5) Improved investment climate for the private sector. The business
environment in Senegal suffers from significant deficiencies and will need a structured program
of analytical work and lending operations to support its improvement. To provide the analytical
basis for operations, three major ESWs will be undertaken during the CPS period.
Analytical Work


An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) will provide an up-to-date analysis of investment
climate issues based on results from a firm-level survey. Youth unemployment remains a big
30

challenge and the government will need to design programs that make labor competitive, and
available. To help inform employment policies, and besides the usual analyses of constraints
to growth and productivity, specific attention will be devoted to the high employment agro
industry and high growth tourism sectors.


Technical assistance and studies on trade and growth will be conducted to support the
authorities’ updated Accelerated Growth Strategy, which is the growth component of the
SNDES. This will involve both sectoral and cross-sectoral analysis, as well as practical
advice to improve the dialogue with the private sector and the implementation of reforms.



IFC will provide the Government with Advisory services support on the investment climate
and assist with the implementation of the reforms. This will include recommendations aimed
at improving contract enforcement, in particular by reducing the duration of proceedings,
facilitating case filing and accelerating the settling of disputes.



IFC will provide support to strengthen the PPP framework through capacity-building
initiatives and developing best practice PPP transactions in key sectors. This activity will
focus on awareness-raising for PPPs and support for the development of a pipeline of PPP
transactions in key line ministries and agencies.
Projects



These reports will help develop a new Growth and Export Development Project. The
project's development objectives will be to improve access to export markets and improve
internal logistics, so as to increase exports and their contribution to growth and employment.



Additional Financing of the Economic Governance Project, which aims to enhance the
effectiveness of justice (delays, tracking of cases) and improve the investment climate related
to justice reform (commercial justice, arbitration, training of judges).

86.
(outcome 6) Improved access to finance for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
(MSMEs). MSMEs are an important segment of the population of firms and a key constraint is
access to finance. Interventions in this area will be carried out jointly by the IFC and the World
Bank.
Analytical Work and Advisory Services


On the World Bank side, a policy note on Access to Finance for MSMEs is planned. The
objective is to understand why existing firms and new entrants have difficulties in financing
their projects.



On the IFC side, using Business Edge and SME toolkit tools, the IFC will work with financial
institutions to help improve MSMEs’ ability to access financing, while, at the SME level,
through “training the trainers,” IFC can avail the training services for strengthening financial
and management skills.
31

Projects


The IDA funded project to be developed in close coordination with the IFC team – to be
based on a policy note - will aim at promoting access to finance for MSMEs.



A range of IFC Financial Sector and Access to Finance projects will have the development
objective of enhancing the ability of MSMEs to obtain financing, including advisory services
to Financial Institutions, capacity building of MSMEs via the Business Edge and SME
Toolkit products, and a new regional Credit Bureau within the UEMOA region.

87.
(outcome 7) Increased agricultural productivity and marketing. Through a valuechain approach, the CPS will help connect producers to domestic and regional markets and to the
private sector, and reduce the need for public sector support to the sector. The CPS will also
work to improve the policy environment in the sector.
Advisory Services and Technical Assistance


Develop a platform for an improved ICT-based pilot subsidy mechanism, which will improve
targeting and distribution systems for agriculture inputs using mobile phones. Excessive and
poorly targeted government interventions are undermining the performance of the agriculture
sector, crowding out more productive investments and undermining private investment. This
pilot will address the issue.



Undertake analytical work on land reform in Senegal as part of the Preparation of a Land
Governance Assessment Framework. This is a multi-sector exercise and will help ensure that
existing land rights are better recognized, including for women, thereby paving the way for
improved inclusiveness of private sector investments in agriculture.

Box 5: Innovative and cross-sectoral approach to managing Resilience
The Sustainable and Inclusive Agribusiness Project is aiming at unlocking the agriculturebased economic growth potential of Senegal while preserving Senegal’s soil-related natural
capital for future uses. It addresses all drivers to land degradation and is community based.
The project provides a good example of Green Growth and could also serve as a model for
other projects under the initiative for the sustainable development of dry lands in Africa.

32



Second phase of the West-Africa Agricultural Productivity Project aimed at raising on-farm
productivity through more demand-driven adaptive agriculture research and more effective
extension and knowledge transfer. The project will support the GoS to rebuild seed capital
with high-yield, drought resistant varieties by enabling the professionalization of certified
seed production at the community level. It will work with stakeholders to improve farm-tomarket links. The WAAP will target women (40%) beneficiaries. This is a regional project.



Food Security and Livestock Support Project under GFRP will help to improve food security
and reduce vulnerability for the most vulnerable. The project will target women, promote
small-scale and diversified food production, and expand food and nutrition behavior change
through improved communication strategies.



The program includes an Agricultural Insurance Development Program (AIDP) Trust Fund
of US$3 million to help build a viable public-private partnership for a sustainable agricultural
index insurance market in targeted ACP countries from the Netherlands.



The IFC-IDA joint Global Index Insurance Facility Program (GIIF) program will assist with
the development of index-based insurance for natural disasters and weather risks. GIIF funds
an implementation grant with PlaNet Guarantee to establish a regional index-based crop
insurance scheme covering 40,000 farmers in 7 IDA countries in West Africa, including
Senegal.



In addition, the first year of the new budget support series, the Growth and Governance
Support Credit (GGSC I), will include actions to improve the quality of domestic spending
on agriculture and to enhance the investment climate for private investments in agriculture
and agribusiness.

88.
(outcome 8) Improved sustainable management of fisheries resources. During the
CPS period, the goal is to introduce secure and fixed rights to freeze the current size of the smallscale fleet, and to support the reduction by up to 50 percent of the industrial trawl fleet,
generating estimated net economic benefits on the order of US$30 million during this time
period.
Project


The regional West Africa Regional Fisheries APL seeks to improve governance in the sector
and strengthen the whole value chain with the aim to ensure employment and food security
while increasing export revenue and economic growth.

89.
(outcome 9A) Improved access to affordable electricity. This is a central piece of the
CPS. The Bank will support the Government with its efforts to improve the energy mix. The
energy sector currently relies heavily on oil imports for power generation, representing roughly
90 percent of the existing electricity supply capacity; the remaining 10 percent coming from
hydropower. Therefore, even though Senegal’s electricity tariffs are among the highest in Africa,
revenues cannot cover costs and the sector is heavily subsidized by the state, crowding out other
productive investments and undermining private investment in the energy sector. The CPS aims
to improve this situation, working with the IFC and MIGA.

33

Analytical Work and Advisory Services



The WBG will assist the Government in developing a concrete action plan for renewable
energy.
In this regard, the WBG will provide technical assistance for a feasibility study to introduce
Liquefied Natural Gas in the country. Both of these initiatives will contribute to further
diversification of the energy mix in the medium-term
Projects



Senegal Electricity Sector Support project. The Bank Group is assisting the Government’s
effort to improve operational and financial performance of the transmission and distribution
of electricity, including advisory services to support the reform of Senelec.



A new Independent Power Producer project of 70MW will be supported by IFC, initially
via its project development fund IFC Infraventures, and by a World Bank PRG. This will
contribute to lower cost power generation in the near-term.



Mauritania- Gas- to-Power for Senegal. The WBG will also support regional integration of
electricity, by promoting natural gas generation in Mauritania that will allow exports to
Senegal of about 80MW, initially at lower costs. This could be a regional project if Mali
were to show interest in the project.



In addition, the first year of the new budget support series, the Growth and Governance
Support Credit (GGSC I), is putting in place the building blocks for reforms in the
electricity sector to improve efficiency, governance and financial viability while reducing
the burden on the national budget. It is setting up a monitoring framework which will then
be pursued in subsequent years of the GGSC series to ensure successful implementation.

90.
(outcome 9B) Improved rural access to electricity. The WBG has ongoing activities
for the sustainable management of traditional household fuels and has also proposed Senegal as
one of the pilot countries for the Sustainable Energy for All initiative to further increase rural
electrification in the country.
91.

(outcome 10) Improved mobility in targeted urban and inter-urban areas.
Analytical Work



Conduct study on quality of public transport services in Dakar through the provision of
high quality rapid-transit bus services based on bus-only segregated bus-ways. The Bank
could finance the construction of the required infrastructure, while the IFC could provide
support to the route concessionaires for the acquisition of buses and/or construction of
depots and workshops.
Project



Rehabilitation of the Dakar-Bamako railway. Further to the required restructuring, should a
viable solution involving the private sector be found, this would provide an opportunity for
joint IFC-WB involvement.
34



In the suburbs of Dakar, rehabilitation of the Petit Train de Banlieue (formerly the Petit
Train Bleu) would also have significant economic benefits.

92.
(outcome 11) Improved skills of labor force. The CPS will respond to the Government
request to assist with closing the skills gap. The ongoing education project supports the
government’s efforts to improve access to and quality of basic education services, particularly
among rural and indigenous populations.
Analytical Work


A Policy Note on Technical and Vocational Training to inform the governance and
management of the sector by involving the private sector more in the design of programs
and service delivery and by setting standards for quality assurance and introducing
performance contracts to create incentives to improve performance.
Projects



A multi-sectoral skills development project with PSD and HD will aim to improve the
relevance of technical and vocational training programs and increase the employability of
graduates.



The Bank will finance the creation and administration of a second university in Dakar, and
IFC will continue its discussions with the Government to explore the potential for
implementing the project on a PPP basis for the university campus. IFC involvement will
contribute to reduced cost for the state and improved skills for the labor market.

Pillar 2: Improving Service Delivery
93.
The CPS will focus on assisting the Government to improve the allocation and
effectiveness of expenditures and the impact on results, particularly in the social sectors.
Attention will be paid to appropriate resource allocation and to ensuring that spending goes
according to plan through careful monitoring of flow and impact. Building on recently
completed service delivery indicators in some sectors, a monitoring and evaluation strategy will
be defined in the medium term that will include baselines and strong mechanisms for follow-up
and verification of progress in these priority investment areas. It will also pay attention to
monitoring outcomes on gender and on disadvantaged areas of the country.
94.

(outcome 12) Enhance equity and improve the quality of education.
Projects



The Improving Quality and Equity in Basic Education (IDA financed) blended with the
GPR Trust Fund, under preparation, is a performance-based operation focused on
accountability, decentralized management and community involvement. It will involve
performance contracts to improve learning outcomes and the quality of teaching, especially
in early grades and for math and science. It will also focus on learning outcomes and
improving access in poor regions for out-of-school children.



In addition, the first year of the new budget support series (GGSC I) is putting in place the
building blocks for reforms in the sector.
35

95.

(outcome 13) Improved health delivery services.
Analytical and Advisory Services



The Bank is working with the government to analyze existing accountability mechanisms
in health care centers (funded by HIRTF).



Conduct a household survey (funded by PSIA TF) to identify quantitatively the bottlenecks
faced by poor pregnant women to obtain quality health care.



In response to the succession of external shocks, the Bank, in collaboration with UNICEF,
will support a policy and partnership TA that will focus on strengthening nutrition policy
and program implementation as a way to protect the poor and vulnerable.



IFC is in discussions with the Ministry of Health (MoH) for a potential advisory role to
implement a Private Public Partnership (PPP) in the health sector. IFC intends to continue
this dialogue with a view to examining high potential opportunities for procuring a private
operator in the sector.
Projects



The Bank will prepare a new health project, using IDA as well as a results-based financing
(RBF) trust fund. Instead of financing inputs (staff, buildings and equipment) to the health
system, the proposed operation will focus on improving performance and accessibility. The
Bank project will build on an RBF pre-pilot, jointly designed with USAID and currently
implemented in 3 districts.



In addition, the first year of the new budget support series (GGSC I) is putting in place the
building blocks for reforms in the sector.

96.
(outcome 14) Improved access to safety nets. The Bank will support the Government
with the provision of tools and procedures that allow for the establishment of an institutional
platform for improving coordination and effectiveness of safety net systems.
Analytical and Advisory TA


Technical Assistance to help the Government set up the CAPSU for implementing an
efficient social protection system.
Projects



In FY14, the Bank will prepare a social safety net project. This project will support
building blocks of an efficient safety net system (including unified registry system,
enrolment and transaction procedures, monitoring and evaluation system) that will be
tested on piloted cash transfer programs.

36

97.
(outcome 15) Improved access to water and sanitation services in selected rural and
urban areas. New water infrastructure is needed to provide 200,000 additional m3/d by 2030,
while investments are needed to help eliminate an expected deficit in 2014 during peak demand
hours. Among the various options being considered are the creation of a third treatment plant on
Lake Guiers, as well as one or more desalination plants: a technology that would be implemented
for the first time in Senegal.
Analytical Work


The Bank will conduct a Drainage Master Plan (PDA) to inform the rehabilitation and
construction of new sewerage systems, and the development of new treatment sites.



A potential advisory role to implement a PPP in the water and sanitation sector by IFC is
being explored with ONAS, Millennium Water and Sanitation Program (PEPAM) and the
Ministry of Water and Sanitation.

World Bank IFC Collaboration – leveraging knowledge and resources
98.
The growth challenges facing Senegal require solutions that involve both public
goods as well as private sector investments. The business case for IDA-IFC-MIGA
collaboration results from the necessity to provide a comprehensive and innovative menu of the
WBG’s instruments to the Government, and thereby make effective use of our combined
knowledge, financial and technical resources. For every dollar of IDA mobilized with IFC
involvement, two additional dollars ($2) would be leveraged. This CPS proposes to deliver a
clear number of joint products (box 6) as a way of strengthening the integration between the
IDA-IFC-MIGA by building on lessons of successful World Bank Group collaboration already
underway in Senegal and learning from Bank-wide experiences. The consultative process for the
CPS was done jointly, and joint IDA and IFC teams worked to develop the action areas in pillar
1.

37

Box 6: Leveraging World Bank Group IDA-IFC Collaboration

Transport: The Bank and the IFC will continue to build on the successful collaboration on the Dakar
Diamniadio toll road, which will significantly reduce the commuting time to Dakar, with both institutions
providing financing to the project. The ongoing project may be complemented with the development and
provision of financing for the extension to the new AIBD Airport. The Bank and the IFC will undertake a
joint study on the rail sector and identify best options to facilitate traffic within Senegal and across its borders
to Mali (Dakar Bamako railway).
Energy: The Bank and IFC will support GoS to improve SENELEC's performance. In particular, both
institutions may support the development and financing of a 70MW Power Plant at Taiba Ndiaye, involving
IFC financing and IDA Partial Risk Guarantee. With PPAIF support, the WBG proposes to support the
development of an updated financial model for SENELEC.
Investment Climate: The Bank and the IFC will support GoS to undertake broader and deeper reforms to
Senegal's investment climate, including providing support to the proper implementation of the OHADA
revised uniforms acts. The team will also undertake joint analytical work (investment climate assessment,
access to finance and barriers to export ESW) to prepare an IDA funded export promotion project.
Public-Private Partnerships: The Bank and the IFC aim to strengthen the PPP framework, beyond the
transport and energy sectors, through capacity building initiatives and best practice PPP transactions in key
sectors such as health, education and/or sanitation.
Access to Finance: IFC will support increased access to finance to MSMEs via further investments and
capacity building to financial institutions committing to that sector; strengthening financial and management
skills for MSMEs using the IFC Business Edge and SME Toolkit; developing the financial infrastructure with
a new regional credit bureau and secured assets registries; and reducing risk to farmers via weather insurance.
The Bank will also undertake further analytical work (report on access to finance issues) to prepare an IDA
funded “access to finance” project.

99.
Regional integration is also a key part of the CPS and of pillar 1, with five ongoing
projects and two new projects and two potential projects (Annex 8). The existing regional
integration agenda demonstrates the power of intra-regional exchanges for inclusive growth and
shared prosperity across sectors such as energy, agriculture, fisheries, water management and the
financial sector. The CPS would continue to find opportunities to leverage regional projects in an
attempt to deepen integration, leverage additional IDA funding, and build knowledge across the
region. Some of the regional projects include:
Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation
100. The CPS Results Framework (CPS RF) presents the priorities of the Bank in
Senegal in alignment with the new SNDES strategic goals. The CPS RF (Annex 1) uses
Senegal’s SNDES as its starting point, and narrows down the range of outcomes to those that the
Bank intends to influence directly through its interventions over the CPS period. It illustrates the
overarching national goals from the SNDES, to which the CPS outcomes, milestones, and related
interventions seek to contribute. The results targets during the CPS period will be largely
achieved with the program already under implementation or to be approved in the next couple of
years.

38

101. This CPS proposes to adopt a cross-sectoral and streamlined approach to
monitoring and evaluation. Given the size of the portfolio and the overlapping nature of the
interventions the CPS proposes, a targeted set of indicators was selected, with clear preference
given to those with existing baselines and an institutional tracking system. Increasingly, the
Bank’s impact is on the convening and advocacy front. The team is discussing development of a
system to track higher-level interventions in order to better understand the full impact of the
Bank’s interventions.
102. To the extent possible, the CPS M&E system will be linked with national M&E
systems. The CPS helps build Senegal’s monitoring systems and capacities at national and sector
levels, as well as Senegal’s overall capacity for statistical data collection and processing and
economic monitoring. The CPS results matrix will be used during implementation to monitor
CPS results. Annual CPPRs will be aligned with the results framework, assessing progress in
achieving CPS outcomes, dealing with risks and problems that might hinder achievement, and
identifying systemic issues that may affect portfolio performance. At mid-term, the CPS
Progress Report will draw on an in-depth examination of the CPS outcomes and assess whether
they remain relevant to the longer-term objectives, given country conditions. A Completion
Report will be completed at the end of the CPS implementation to feed into the next CPS cycle.
The CPS and Portfolio Implementation
103. Achievement of the results of the proposed CPS will depend to a large extent on
existing programs and the speed with which new programs are developed and
implemented. Learning from the previous CAS period, special attention will be paid to problem
projects and disbursements in order to ensure smooth implementation of projects and improve
utilization of resources.
104. As of end of June 2012, the portfolio of Senegal, including 6 regional projects,
consists of 21 operations and 14 trust funds totaling $942 million in net commitments, of
which $582 million remains undisbursed. The commitments exclude budget support through
the PRSP, which is $40 million annually. The overall disbursement rate for the portfolio remains
low, given some procurement constraints and difficulties of implementation in the process of the
E-signature disbursement. As a result of the last CPPR, some actions have been taken to
overcome systemic procurement issues; and training on E-signature disbursement procedures
have been performed for all FM of projects. Thus, a significant increase in country disbursement
rate is expected during the coming years. Portfolio performance has generally been good, as most
of the projects’ ISRs are rated as satisfactory with a moderate FM risk rating. Three projects
remain unsatisfactory with substantial FM risk due to ineligible expenditures and weak internal
control (GDRH, ASER and PRAO SN). The interim financial reports (IFR) are being submitted
on time to the Bank with an acceptable quality. In the last three years, i.e., FY 09 to FY 11,
Senegal achieved 100% fiduciary compliance of audited reports submitted within the fiscal year.
This performance is higher than the Africa target of 90 percent. Most of the opinions of the last
audit reports were unqualified and there are no pending issues of ineligible expenditures.
Regarding the Regional projects, three projects are supposed to close during this fiscal (WAAPP,
PGIRE and PRSSTAAOC). The second phase of WAAPP and PGIRE are in preparation.
39

Continuing FM capacity-building sessions are planned in the FM implementation support plan to
address FM cross-cutting issues and speed up the disbursement rate during the CAS period.
105. IFCs current committed portfolio in Senegal is $98 million, composed of six loans,
six equity investments and two guarantees. IFC’s strategy for Senegal during the previous
CAS period has focused on four areas: (i) increase access to finance for SMEs and
microenterprise through financial intermediaries, with the provision of investment and advisory
services; (ii) support the private provision of infrastructure with a focus on power and
transportation; (iii) support the agribusiness value chain both directly and through financial
intermediaries; and (iv) seek to improve the business enabling environment. IFC's current
committed portfolio in Senegal, as of 30 September 2012, was $98 million invested in 12
companies, composed of six loans, six equity investments and two guarantees. The portfolio is
concentrated in the infrastructure sector, including financing to two IPPs and to the DakarDiamniadio Toll road (54 percent), followed by the financial sector, including microfinance (23
percent) and agribusiness, manufacturing and services (23 percent).
106. In advisory services, IFC had eight active programs in Senegal during FY12,
including capacity building to MSMEs via the rollout of the Business Edge and SME Toolkit
products, and increased access to finance to MSMEs via support to banks and microfinance
clients. Access to finance to MSMEs has also benefited from two regional programs, namely the
Africa Leasing Facility to promote leasing as an alternative financing mechanism, and the Global
Index Insurance Facility to develop index insurances against natural disasters and weather risks
with PlaNet Guarantee as partner. A project in Corporate Governance was carried out to prepare
Senegal's first Corporate Governance Code and support the Institut Sénégalais des
Administrateurs. Lastly, IFC has supported the review of OHADA codes and their
implementation to improve investment climate across the region, including in Senegal.
107. The FY13-17 CAS period will be funded across two IDA replenishment periods. The
first two years (FY13-14) will be funded under IDA16 and the last three years (FY15-17) will be
funded under IDA17. Most of the projects will be prepared in the first three years of the CPS in
order to help the government accelerate growth. In addition, in 2014 the government will begin
the new election cycle, and there is likely to be a slowdown in project preparation. The WBG
proposes to use this period to support implementation, to accelerate disbursements of the
program and to deepen analytical work.
Partnerships
108. Successful implementation of the CPS will depend on strong leadership by the
government of its development agenda and its ability to effectively coordinate development
partners. A number of thematic donor working groups exist, with varying degrees of efficiency.
Under this CPS, the WBG will continue to deepen its partnerships, especially in critical sectors,
with other donors, and concentrate on activities in its core areas of competency and comparative
advantage. The Bank Group works extensively with various donors on different areas of the CPS
and this will be further strengthened (see Annex 9).

40

109. Close collaboration will continue with the IMF on macroeconomic policy and with
other partners engaged in budget support. The IMF is currently helping the government with
a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which will continue until the end of 2013. At the
request of the past and current governments, no funding is being provided by the IMF. The
WBG is expected to advise the Fund on a variety of structural reforms covered by their program,
notably in energy and other sectors. A small group of donors provide budget support along with
the World Bank, including the Netherlands (through 2014), Canada, the European Union, Spain,
and the AfDB. This group meets regularly and is finalizing a new framework for their
partnership with the government. France provided budget support on an exceptional basis in
2012 but may continue in 2013. The AfDB leads the group.
Consultations
110. The preparation of the CPS benefited from the 2011 client survey, which provided
candid feedback and the opportunity for extensive consultations with stakeholders. Key
players in the development sector were invited to share their views on the partnership between
the World Bank and Senegal. Representatives from civil society, universities, the private sector
(employers and trade unions, informal sector), academia and think tanks, women-youth-faith
groups, development partners, project implementation units, and the new cabinet all welcomed
the positive role of the World Bank Group in Senegal and the early and participatory
consultation undertaken by WBG in the design of the current CPS. In addition, they largely
identified the same core development issues as those developed by WBG (see Annex 5). The
need for realism and concentration in order to have impact, the need for good governance and
accountability, and the importance of the energy sector were identified as critical issues by
almost all groups.
111. As part of the CPS, the engagement of the legislature with the WBG will be
strengthened, as requested by the deputies. The Bank has a history of working with
parliament. During the previous CAS, the WBG supported the creation of the West Africa
Chapter of the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank (PNoWB). With the new assembly
elected in 2012, the national chapter of PNoWB will continue to support capacity building for
deputies and a knowledge and exchange platform with other Parliaments.

IV.

Risks
112. Economic risks present a serious challenge to the goals of the CPS. The strong
reliance of Senegalese exports on Mali and Europe, prolonged uncertainties in Mali, and a
continued weak growth in Europe will undermine Senegal’s growth aspirations. In addition,
remittances are an important part of the economy, and a prolonged crisis in the west could lower
transfers and increase social tensions in an environment where pressures are high and space for
additional stimulus spending limited. Continuous macroeconomic policy dialogue in close
coordination with the IMF and through the development of a better targeted and effective social
assistance system should help mitigate this risk.

41

113. Regional political instability remains a risk for Senegal. In 2012, two coups d’états
occurred in neighboring Mali and Guinea Bissau. Mali is particularly important economically as
Senegal’s largest trading partner and transit destination, while Guinea Bissau’s instability
hampers the resolution of the Casamance crisis. Continued instability in the Sahel will
undermine growth and threaten the stability of Senegal. The team will work closely the UN and
other agencies to ensure all risks to Senegal are acknowledged and addressed as part of the Sahel
initiative.
114. Increased vulnerability to price shocks and natural disasters: High food prices,
increases in oil prices, and increased flooding could all stretch the budget and undermine the
fiscal consolidation effort underway. Increased transfers to the vulnerable to address crises (such
as in the last CPS) would delay implementation of the SNDES. The Government has made some
progress in disaster management and preparedness; and increased agriculture output, particularly
for the most vulnerable, is an important tool to help the poor withstand recurring shocks. The
CPS will work with the government to fast track preparation of projects to address these risks.
115. Sustainability of government reforms and limited implementation capacity of the
public administration represents a governance risk. The limited capacity of public
administration to implement committed policies and reforms may generate tensions between the
government and the civil society, particularly under the pressure of external shocks, and it may
also lead to reverting to previous practices such as use of off-budget accounts. The CPS attempts
to mitigate this risk through: (i) regular dialogue with the political authorities; (ii) proactive
dissemination of information; (iii) reliance on civil society to monitor governance environment
and implementation; and (v) project and policy dialogue.
116. Implementation risks: Portfolio implementation delays, due in part to low capacity and
poor coordination amongst government agencies, may delay the program. The CPS attempts to
minimize the risk of delays by: (i) focusing operations on areas of high strategic importance; and
(ii) building wide consensus on the content of the operations throughout the development phase.
Execution will also be a challenge, due in part to the lack of adequate staff qualified to manage
the procurement process. To mitigate this risk, WBG staff will be more engaged in the project
management process and increase the number of portfolio reviews with the government (from
once a year to three times a year). To minimize delays, efforts will continue during the approval
process to ensure that implementation readiness and project design is clear and implementable.

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FY07-10 COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT
Summary
1.
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses program
performance and Bank performance for the FY07-10 Senegal Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 20,
2007 (Report No. 36608-SN). This assessment covers the period up to December 31,
2010, extending the discussion beyond FY10 in some cases as the preparation of the next
CAS was postponed due to delays in finalization of the PRSP-III and the March 2012
presidential elections in Senegal. During most of the years covered by this assessment,
implementation challenges were significant because Senegal had to deal with a series of
external shocks and risks of a magnitude that few could have foreseen.
2.
Senegal’s economic performance has been greatly affected by recent external
shocks and poor governance. Although Senegal had a good system, of public
accountability and transparency, these systems weakened between 2006 and 2011 and
Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index for Senegal declined from
between 2007 and 2011 from 3.6 to 2.9. This has hampered achievements, in terms of
objectives of the PRSP to which the CAS was designed to contribute to. Senegal has not
shared the rapid growth experienced by its peer sub-Saharan countries over the last
decade; growth in Senegal averaged only at 4 percent between 2000 and 2010 (short of
the 7 percent envisaged in the PRSP) compared to 6 percent for the rest of SSA. There
has been no significant reduction in poverty between 2006 and 2011, and progress
towards the MDGs, while encouraging, have thus been short of original expectations.
3.
Although 15 of the 26 expected CAS outcomes were achieved, the fact that many
others were either partially or not achieved leads to an assessment of the outcomes of the
program as moderately unsatisfactory. Bank performance, however, is assessed as
satisfactory, both for program design and implementation. The Bank was particularly
proactive and with flexibility in adjusting the program to changing country circumstances
and priorities. In particular, the PRSC and other operations approved during the period of
2008-2009 successfully helped the country mitigate the risks resulting from the
successive shocks
4.
Lessons learned from the CAS include: the strong impact of a long-term Bank
involvement in focused areas as well as the need for more realism in design of the
operations and adjustments during their implementation, especially in areas where
reforms are difficult and governance aspects are critical. The effectiveness of wellfocused budget support with strong analytical underpinnings has been confirmed again,
and the impact of multi-sectoral DPOs has been shown to be stronger when they are
delivered in synergy with parallel sectoral operations.

53

5.
Senegal faces the risk of stalled growth. Higher growth rates, of 7 percent and
beyond, will be necessary to reach the MDGs and reduce poverty. Such growth would
need to be driven by broadening private sector activity well beyond current levels.
Fostering strong growth will also require sustained transformational changes in the
economy. For the next CAS, a guiding Bank principle should be to continue
engagements in areas where the Bank has long experience, or become engaged where
there is potential for transformative change and Bank interventions can have
demonstration effects that trigger greater change.
Context and Objectives of the CAS
6.
When the 2007-2010 CAS was being prepared, the Government had adopted its
second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) covering 2006-2010. The
PRSP vision was articulated around four pillars9: (i) wealth creation; (ii) access to basic
social services; (iii) protection of vulnerable groups; and (iv) greater transparency and
participatory processes. At the center of the first pillar, the authorities had placed the
newly adopted Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS) which emphasized the need to
encourage private sector led growth and to expand and diversify exports. It was hoped
that rapid implementation of the AGS would accelerate economic growth to the range of
7-8 percent, a significant improvement over the average growth of 4-5 percent
experienced by Senegal from 1994 to 2005. The Government and the World Bank Group
(WBG) shared a common vision of the overall objectives to be achieved over the next
years. The new CAS thus aimed at supporting Senegal's PRSP-II with the ultimate
objective of attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It reflected various
phases of the consultation process within the WBG and in Senegal. It also recognized the
regional dimension of Senegal’s development as well as the importance of enhancing
gender development and building further local capacity.
7.
The proposed activities of the 2007-2010 CAS were clustered around three pillars
and one cross-sector governance filter: (i) fostering economic growth through support to
private sector development; (ii) improving human development through better delivery of
social services, notably to the most vulnerable groups; and (iii) enhancing rural and urban
synergies. Transparency was to be mainstreamed in all programs and projects supported
by the CAS to help improve public and private governance. Bank support was envisaged
to achieve the following major outcomes under the three pillars:

Pillar I: Strengthening GDP growth to an annual rate higher than Senegal’s
historical average, as one of the prerequisites for reaching MDGs. WBG support aimed
to achieve the following outcomes: (i) promoting a competitive investment climate; (ii)
building and maintaining basic infrastructure for growth; (iii) facilitating access to
financial resources by small and medium enterprises; (iv) promoting a modern and

9

The first three pillars were already included in the first PRSP (2003-2005), while the last one has emerged as a new
priority for the authorities.

54

diversified agricultural sector; (v) fostering sustainable development and management of
natural resources; and (vi) developing skilled labor and use of technology10.

Pillar II: Human development and shared growth. Increasing access to social
services and creating opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups was at the heart of
Senegal’s PRSP agenda. WBG support aimed at: (i) increasing quality of and access to
basic education; (ii) improving health services provision for women and children; and
(iii) improving protection of targeted vulnerable groups.

Pillar III: Rural and urban synergies. The rapid urbanization in Senegal is a
major challenge and the authorities need to find the right balance between urban and rural
development. WBG support aimed at: (i) balancing the provision of infrastructure
between urban and rural areas; (ii) reducing the vulnerability of immigrants and
emigrants; and (iii) improving the quality of life of the population through better
management of natural resources and improved access to water and sanitation.
8.
The governance filter of the CAS was also aligned with the PRSP-II fourth pillar
on transparency and participatory processes, justified by the need to strengthen the
effectiveness of public spending (through efficient budgetary procedures and controls) as
well as to promote private sector development (through less distortion and better access
to justice). The proposed WBG assistance thus aimed at: (i) greater transparency and
efficiency in the use of public resources; (ii) increasing public sector accountability
through decentralization, stronger institutions and better information; and (iii)
strengthening and modernizing the judicial system and mechanisms for private
governance.
9.
The 2007-2010 CAS was also strongly influenced by the 2003 CAS, itself
organized around three key pillars with areas of focus which retained and/or emphasized
in the next CAS: (i) wealth creation; (ii) capacity building and promotion of basic social
services; and (iii) improving the living conditions of vulnerable groups. A large number
of corresponding activities started prior to 2007-2010 CAS - mainly 16 operations11 were thus pursued, including a DPO (Private Sector Adjustment Credit), five APLs and
other investment projects. Following-up also on the two first PRSCs approved in 2004
and 2006, PRSC III, the last of this first series of PRSCs for Senegal was approved in
June 2007 together with the CAS.
10.
Using a selected mix of financing instruments and a targeted program of
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), the CAS was aligned with ongoing reform
programs, while moving gradually toward a more programmatic approach. It also
promoted selectivity by leaving aside some key aspects of the PRSP agenda, such as
support to the livestock sector, the banking sector and telecommunications, which were
likely to benefit from assistance from other donors. Active partnerships with the private
sector and other donors were planned, including in the water and road sectors. In other

This sixth outcome was des-emphasized with the CASPR (Report 48600-SNCFT, May 28, 2009).
There were in addition two regional APLs, the West Africa Agriculture Productivity Program and the Felou Hydroelectric APL.

55

sectors, complementarities were sought in terms of lending instruments12. The CAS
aimed at maximizing the impact of the WBG’s assistance: (i) with the use of various
financial instruments such as budget support, single investment projects, and community
driven development initiatives; (ii) by maximizing synergies within the WBG; and (iii)
leveraging financial resources beyond the country allocation through partnerships and
donor coordination. The use diversified mechanisms to deliver the program of assistance
was consistent with the objective of increasing mutual accountability and aligning
disbursement procedures with national systems and enhancing cross-sector externalities
in areas such as budgetary and financial reforms, decentralization, and the protection of
vulnerable groups.
11.
The CAS was supported by a strong program of AAA. Sixteen pieces of ESW
were delivered, along with two TA activities. This included a country economic
memorandum, a poverty assessment, a multi-sector public expenditure review, and a
country environmental assessment. Three smaller pieces of ESW, planned in the later
years of the CAS, were dropped, but they were replaced by three others. The initial
projections for delivery tended to be overly optimistic so many products slipped by a
year.
12.
The CAS proposed a lending program based on a total envelope of IDA resources
of US$420 million over four years (or an average of US$l05 million a year) balancing the
WBG’s assistance across the three key pillars and the governance filter. Proposed support
to the three CAS pillars was equally divided between pillars I and III (with a share of 44
percent and 40 percent of total lending respectively), with pillar II receiving about 16
percent of the Bank’s assistance. By FY09 and FY10, with the start of the second PRSC
series, PRSCs were expected to become the key WBG’s instrument to sustain human
development in Senegal, including the protection of vulnerable groups. At the same time,
Bank would still rely on CDD-type operations, with the aim to increase empowerment of
local communities and final beneficiaries, and strengthen the decentralization process. It
was also planned to intensify efforts at mobilizing extra funding for ESW through Trust
Funds and collaborative efforts with other donors; for example the planned Public
Expenditure Financial Assessment (PEFA) was to be carried out with the donors
providing budgetary support.
13.
The results-based framework for the CAS comprised 26 main outcomes aligned
with the PRSP objectives and MDGs. Overall success for the WBG was expected to be
measured in principle by the contribution of the CAS to high order national goals: (i)
higher GDP growth in the range of 7 percent; (ii) reduction in poverty levels, notably in
rural areas, along the lines of the first MDG; and (iii) the capacity to generate more and
better jobs, leading to a decline by half of unemployment and underemployment rates.
The CAS report listed a number of risks, including the vulnerability to internal and
external shocks. It underscored the risks of stalled growth and vulnerability to natural
disasters and external shocks.

Developments and Adjustments during CAS Implementation
14.
Implementation of the CAS had barely started when Senegal was hit by a
succession of shocks of a magnitude that few could have foreseen, and which deeply
affected economic and fiscal performance. First, the run up in oil prices and the surge in
food prices started to weigh down the economy in 2007. Increasing problems13 of the
State-owned power company SENELEC, resulting in high costs and blackouts, also hurt
economic activity. Poor rains in 2007 led to a fall of agricultural output which in turn
contributed to exacerbate the impact of escalating food prices on the population. Second,
with the onset of the global recession in 2008 GDP growth declined, fiscal performance
turned out unusually weak and budget slippages led to a large accumulation of unpaid
bills by the Government to domestic suppliers. Construction and commercial activity
slowed sharply with the combined effect of substantial payment delays to suppliers and
the negative impact of surging oil and food prices on the demand for domestic output.
15.
By 2009 further effects of the global crisis were felt with major channels of
transmission of the global economic recession to the Senegalese economy being exports,
remittances, tourism and foreign direct investment. While revenues were expected to fall
short of the budget’s original targets, leaving overall spending targets unchanged and
allowing a widening of the deficit appeared as a more desirable option by avoiding a
contractionary stance at a time when the economy could least afford it and developmental
goals were most vulnerable. A supplemental budget was prepared. In addition to
substantial support from donors the Government managed to mobilize additional shortterm domestic bank financing. The prompt and early completion of the authorities’
domestic arrears clearance plan was a key element of the policy response to the crisis.
The authorities also undertook a core set of critical actions to restore budget discipline
and avoid a recurrence of slippages by accelerating Public Financial Management
reforms (PFM). Instead of the 4th PRSC originally planned a new stand-alone DPO – the
Public Finance Support Credit (PFSC) – was swiftly prepared and approved in June 2009
to respond to Senegal’s need for additional financial assistance and to support those new
actions with a primary focus on fiscal issues.
16.
The succession of shocks had a significant impact on GDP growth. As shown in
Annex 1, Political and Economic Development during the CAS period, following a first
severe drop to 2.4 percent in 2006, real GDP growth averaged 3.4 percent, significantly
below the 5 percent average achieved between 1994 and 2005. Growth started to recover
only by 2010 when it was estimated at 4.2 percent. This performance is disappointing
when compared to the PRSP-II expectations. As the population growth rate remained
around 2.5 percent per year, per capita income growth stagnated as shown by the 2011
poverty survey. Poverty rates dropped from 48.5 percent in 2005 to 46.7 percent in 2011.
17.
On the political front, although Senegal continued to enjoy a relatively stable
political climate during the CAS period with President Wade winning his second term
with the 2007 elections, the political context was further complicated when his coalition
13

Higher oil prices and a policy-mandated incomplete pass-through to retail electricity prices compounded internal
inefficiency in SENELEC.

57

lost control of the city council in the capital Dakar and other key cities in the country in
the March 2009 local elections. Some policies and reforms on which a broad consensus
had not been forged became more difficult to implement because of the relative victory of
the opposition. In some sectors, the turn-over of ministers was fast but key ministers,
including the Minister of economy and finance stayed. Frustrations due to unmet
expectations, increased food prices, higher electricity prices and power outages, and high
unemployment resulted in some social unrest in the country, as the population continued
to press for government actions against any further deterioration of their living standards.
The overall context required accelerated reforms and a balance between short and longterm goals. Increased vulnerability in a difficult global environment called for quick
responses but at the same time the Government had to keep the focus on areas of longterm growth potential.
18.
The Bank reacted swiftly to the succession of shocks that Senegal faced.
Adjustments were made to the program, primarily to respond effectively to the crisis
resulting from the successive shocks and particularly meet the country’s urgent financing
needs. Instead of a new series of three PRSCs starting in FY09, the stand-alone Public
Finance Support Credit DPO was approved in June 2009 with a US$60 million
equivalent14 credit. This provided more time for the design of a medium-term reform
agenda supported under the new PRSC series that eventually started with PRSC-IV in
June 2010. Financing for The Dakar-Diamniadio Toll road project (FY09) was scaled up
from US$80 million to US$105 million to help close a financing gap for this critical
project. US$20 million in IDA funds cancelled from the Private Sector Adjustment
operation were reallocated to fund a rapid response to the food crisis under the Global
Food Crisis Response Program through two operations: (i) the Emergency Nutrition/Cash
Transfer project to assist the most vulnerable (FY09), and (ii) an additional financing to
the Agricultural Markets project to finance rapid interventions in agriculture (FY010).
Also emergency support was provided through the ongoing the Participatory Local
Development Project to finance urgent pumping equipment purchases after the August
2009 Dakar floods.
19.
Other adjustments were made to the program allowing, inter alia, some degree of
consolidation of the portfolio. The second tranche (US$24 million) of the unsatisfactory
Energy Sector Recovery DPO was cancelled in December 2010 as well as the remaining
proceeds of the Energy Sector Efficiency Project, and recommitted to the 2011 PRSC-V
and Public Finance Management TA. Few planned operations were dropped - the
proposed Accelerated Growth Strategy operation and the regional Senegal-MauritaniaGambia Integration operations - while several were postponed and approved or were
expected to be approved after the end of the CAS period. In contrast, five additional
operations15 were approved. Most of the APLs still under implementation shortly before

14

In addition the first tranche (US$56 million) of the Energy Sector Recovery DPO, programmed in the CAS, was
disbursed in September 2008.

15

West Africa Air Transport Safety, Rapid Response Nutrition Security/Cash Transfer, Public Finance Support Credit,
Sustainable Land Management GEF, Regional Fisheries - excluding the Sustainable Management of Fisheries
Resources Additional Financing and Felou Hydroelectric Additional Financing.

58

or by the beginning of the CAS period were pursued with a second APL phase 16: Also
the four operations planned as follow-up to the Second Transport Sector Project (closed
in 2007) and Urban Mobility Improvement Project (closed in 2008) were consolidated in
one operation: the June 2010 Transport and Urban Mobility Project. The planned
Judicial Government project was broadened as the Economic Governance Project
(approved in June 2010).
20.
The Bank delivered significantly more resources over the CAS period (US$680
million – including US$80 million of Senegal’s share in regional projects) than originally
programmed (US$420 million) – see Table 2. The additional resources came primarily
from: (i) reallocations of US$130 million to the Senegal country program from within the
Africa Region, primarily to finance the Energy Sector Recovery DPO and for the
economic crisis-related responses in FY09, (ii) a slightly larger IDA-15 envelope, (iii) a
reprogramming of a cancelled tranche of the PSAC operation to support two Global Food
Price Crisis Response operations, and (iv) higher allocations with the regional projects
approved during the CAS. A significant use of trust fund resources also made during the
CAS period, with total new commitments exceeding to about US105 million, including
funds from a Multi-donor Trust fund for Public Finance Management and another Multidonor Trust Fund for a Rapid Response Child-focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition
Security. In addition to the PRSC-III approved in June 2007 (when the CAS was
discussed by the Board) 18 new operations were approved until June 30, 2010, among
which PRSC-IV, two other DPOs and four regional projects (see table 2 and Annex 2).
The weight of infrastructure was important; with for example 41% of the portfolio
devoted to energy and transport plus 17% in local development in terms of commitments
by end of 2009.
21.
In Senegal IFC committed $98 million over the CAS period and invested in 12
companies, composed of six loans, six equity and two guarantees. The portfolio was
concentrated in the infrastructure sector including financing to two IPPs, two rural
electrification PPPs and the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll road, followed by investments in two
banks (Ecobank and CBAO Attijariwafa) and two microfinance Greenfield operations
(Microcred Senegal and St Louis Finance), two agribusiness (GRIMAS and Patisen) and
one hotel (Radisson Blu). In advisory services, IFC had eight active programs in Senegal
at the end of the CAS period, including capacity building to MSMEs via the rollout of the
Business Edge and SME Toolkit products, and increased access to finance to MSMEs via
support to banks and microfinance clients. Access to finance to MSMEs has also
benefited from the Africa Leasing Facility to promote leasing as an alternative financing
mechanism. A project in Corporate Governance was carried out to prepare Senegal's first
Corporate Governance Code and support the Institut Sénégalais des Administrateurs.
Lastly, IFC has supported the review of OHADA uniform acts and their implementation
to improve investment climate across the region including in Senegal. None of MIGAs
guarantees were called during the CAS period.

16
The APLs for which a second phase was approved during the CAS were the Nutrition, Quality Education for All,
Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management, Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations and Felou
Hydroelectric projects.

59

22.
A substantial program of analytical work has been undertaken, broadly fulfilling
the scope of what was planned under the CAS although there has been some slippage
between years (see Table 3). Significant non-lending work included the Country
Economic Memorandum, the Poverty Assessment, the FY07 Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) and the PEFA carried out for the city of Dakar (which
underpinned the preparation of budget support operations), technical assistance in
Hospital Reform and a major Programmatic Public Expenditure Review with a first phase
covering education, health and transport. The Bank also continued to engage in dialogue
with the Government in the key area of spatial integration, both in terms of territorial
development and of regional integration.
23.
A CAS Progress Report (CASPR) was issued in May 2009 (Report 48600-SN). It
did not recommend any significant adjustments for the remaining years of the CAS, and
we recognize that major readjustments could have been done to reflect the country
changing circumstances and priorities of a country faced with both internal (mainly
governance) and external shocks. It did, however, suggest some postponements of
national investment and regional projects to the next CAS. The CASPR concluded that
(i) while progress against CAS goals had been mixed to-date, the strategic objectives set
out in the CAS remained consistent with national priorities; (ii) projects were broadly on
track to achieve their development objectives; and (iii) the analytical work undertaken or
that was being undertaken would adequately underpin the preparation of a new
partnership strategy with Senegal during FY11. The review of the original outcomes
(with a large number of indicators around which the CAS strategy had been developed)
concluded that some of these indicators needed to be revised or replaced17 and the results
matrix was adjusted accordingly. The risks18 identified in the CAS were considered as
still valid but were overshadowed by the uncertainty emanating from the crisis. The
overriding risk had been, and remained, that of external shocks. Also, Governance and
resistance to policy reforms from vested interests did materialize and continued to be
present.
Program Performance Evaluation
24.
An evaluation of program performance is provided in table 1 around the outcomes
and indicators as revised in the CASPR, and based on specific detailed subprogram
reviews and evaluations for each of the sectors or main areas of engagement provided in
annexes 3-1 to 3-10. This evaluation is summarized below for the cross-cutting
governance filter and each of the three pillars. It concluded that performance assessed up
to December 2010 has been moderately unsatisfactory. Acceptable to good progress was
achieved towards 15 of 26 outcomes, with two others partially achieved. However, in the
energy sector progress was mixed, with major shortcomings with respect to the power
utility SENELEC up to 2010.
17

They had proven not to be easily measurable or they were conceived at the time of CAS preparation when the
relevant Bank operations had not yet been designed.

18
They were: (i) governance and resistance to policy reforms from vested interests; (ii) vulnerability to political,
economic, and other internal and external shocks, and volatility of donor support, and (iii) insufficient capacity to
implement reforms and sustain growth.

60

Governance filter
25.
Good progress was achieved on the governance filter. Progress was substantial in
improving efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources particularly after the
CASPR when the Bank intensified and sharpened it focus in support on PFM. Likewise,
with respect to increasing public sector accountability through decentralization, stronger
institutions, and better information the revised outcomes were achieved in terms of
transferring funds for the local governments, building institutions and legal framework
for and actual auditing of Government procurement, and publishing budget execution
documents. Progress on the public procurement front was particularly impressive19.
Little progress was made in strengthening and modernizing the judicial system and
mechanisms for private sector governance. Progress in improving functioning of the
justice sector has been slow. The expected outcome on contract enforcement time had
not yet been achieved. More time will be needed for the impact of the recent (FY010)
Economic Governance Project addressing also access to justice sector, to be felt.
Pillar 1 – Growth/Wealth Creation
26.
Progress has been mixed under this pillar, ranging from quite poor in the grid
electrical power subsector (SENELEC) to encouraging (agriculture, fisheries and road
maintenance funding) or relatively strong in investment climate and wood fuels. With
respect to Promoting a competitive investment climate, reforms to improve the business
climate were significant in 2008-09. It is important to highlight that Senegal focused its
reforms, undertaken in collaboration with IFC, in two areas: trade processes facilitation
and business entry simplification. After 2009, reforms in this area stalled, mainly due to
some shortcomings in the monitoring of the implementation of reforms. In fact, GoS was
unable to ensure that regulatory and legal reforms are translated into concrete
improvements on the ground. Indeed, Governments typically must put in place strong
mechanism of supervision of reforms in order to ensure changes are implemented in
practice.
27.
Regarding Building and maintaining basic infrastructure, progress was uneven.
On the one hand, great strides have been accomplished in creating the new FERA road
fund for sustainable road maintenance and in increasing funding to adequate levels in the
last FYs. But the targets in improving the proportion of the quality road network have not
yet been achieved and the strategy for maintenance implemented during the recent years
may not have been optimal. Expected outcomes on SENELEC power tariffs were not
achieved and more broadly no progress whatsoever has been made to improve
SENELEC’s dramatic financial situation and poor overall performance. But there has
been strong progress in the development and use of PPP and in rural electrification (with
private concessions) allowing significantly increased access to electricity in rural
Senegal.

19

By 2010 for example, about 60% of procurement in Bank operations could be carried out under the
national procurement rules.

61

28.
On the IFC side, the objective to set up IDA/IFC partial Credit Guarantees to
facilitate access to financial resources by SMEs failed to materialize. However other
projects have succeeded to support access to finance by SMEs: two IFC microfinance
projects (Microcred and Saint Louis Finance - Fides), and four SME support programs,
including (a) AMSME program to build capacity support to Ecobank Senegal; (b) Africa
Leasing Facility program to improve the legal and tax framework, create awareness and
foster investments to facilitate leasing as a financing alternative; (c) SME Toolkit and
Business Edge; and (d) the launch of an incubator for SMEs in the ICT sector with
InfoDev.
29.
In contrast, with the Bank’s substantial support to help promote a modern and
diversified agriculture sector good progress has been achieved in increasing rural income
and progress is well underway in rehabilitating small scale irrigation schemes in the
Senegal River Valley to increase food security. Achievements towards promoting
sustainable development and management of natural resources are mixed but are overall
satisfactory. In the fisheries sector, objectives regarding reduction in the level of fishing
effort on targeted species in 12 central coastal fishing communities have essentially been
reached. As the key Sustainable Land Management operation (GEF) became effective
only mid-2010, concrete results towards having large areas of land sustainably managed
in sylvo-pastoral zones and the groundnut basin may take some time to materialize. In
contrast, the targets for the establishment of sustainable community managed forests to
meet 75 percent of household wood fuels needs at the national level through have been
reached, and an important breakthrough was made with the Government decree to
eliminate the charcoal quota system.
Pillar II - Promoting Human Development/Shared Growth
30.
Overall, results in this pillar were good with most outcomes partially achieved.
There has been progress in improving the quality of and access to basic education but
more is still needed. Gender parity has already been attained at the primary level. The
success rate in achieving primary level education has increased significantly but is still
short of the target. There is mixed progress in improving health services provision for
women and children. The proportion of assisted births at the national level has increased
to a level close to the target. Nutrition enhancement efforts have been successful: the
objective regarding the percentage of children receiving supplements has been met while
the achievements for households with insecticide treated nets have exceeded targets.
Senegal has also reached the MDG in the area of HIV/AIDS. With respect to improving
the protection of targeted vulnerable groups, the objective regarding the percentage of
children showing adequate weight gain has been achieved. Most targets of the successful
Rapid Response Child-Focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security Project have
been exceeded.
Pillar III – Maximizing Rural and Urban Synergies
31.
Two main outcomes were expected with respect to improving urban mobility and
access in and out of Dakar and promoting regional centers. The final outcome cannot
yet be measured regarding the Dakar-Diamniadio Toll Highway since construction is still

62

underway. The intermediate outcome has been achieved – with the completion of its first
two sections and start of construction of other sections. Targets for the rehabilitation of
social infrastructure affected by the Casamance conflict have essentially been met, with
specific targets of the Casamance Emergency Reconstruction Project met or exceeded. In
contrast, progress has been slow in reducing the vulnerability of immigrant and emigrant
groups, and especially of street children in Dakar: The expected outcome was not
specifically measured but Government data show some improvement – in absolute
numbers of children withdrawn from work. Impressive progress has been made on
improving the quality of life through better management of natural resources and access
to water and sanitation. The objectives in numbers of people in rural areas having gained
access to sanitation and to drinking water have been respectively met and exceeded. The
achievements are also impressive in urban areas where another one and half million
people gained access to safe drinking water.
Regional operations
32.
The CAS results matrix did not bring forward specific outcomes for the Bank’s
substantive portfolio of regional operations in Senegal - with six operations, most of them
concentrating under the Wealth Creation Pillar20. A number of these are programs that
are in effect transformational by nature and clearly contribute significantly to Senegal’s
growth. The specific development objectives of most of these operations have or are in
the process of being met.
Bank Performance
33.
The performance of the Bank is assessed as satisfactory both for the design of the
CAS and for the implementation of the program. The design of the CAS program was
well aligned with Senegal’s development priorities and the Government’s strategy laid
out in its PRSP-II. Starting with guiding principle that it was essential for Senegal to
break with its history of relatively mixed results in terms of growth, equity and poverty
alleviation, the program rightly stressed: (i) private sector as the driver of growth,
improvement of public service delivery, (ii) inclusiveness of growth for better poverty
alleviation and (iii) strengthening territorial/spatial development with a more balanced
approach to territorial development. With its cross-cutting filter the program adequately
emphasized the fourth PRSP pillar devoted to governance and the need to promote
further decentralization and participatory mechanisms. The planned CAS assistance was
selective and focused on actions where the WBG has a comparative advantage, taking
into account other donor programs. It was well clustered around one cross-cutting filter
and three pillars to maximize impact enhance synergy, reduce fragmentation while still
providing flexibility over the CAS period. The CAS kept a significant continuity with
the ongoing reform programs, while moving gradually toward a more programmatic
approach. The areas of engagements were all highly relevant. It is likely that the

20

They are: The West Africa Air Transport project (approved in February 2009); West Africa Productivity Program
(approved in March 2007); Sustainable Management of Fish Resources project (approved in December 2008); OMVS
Felou Hydroelectric project (approved in June 2006); Africa Emergency Locust project (approved in December 2004),
and the Senegal River Basin Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development project (approved in June 2006).

63

selection of a broad public administration reform program would not have been supported
by the authorities in the context prevailing in 2006-07, particularly given the lack of
adequate prior preparatory AAA and the limited leverage of the Bank and other donors in
Senegal on such a complex and sensitive undertaking. The Bank instead undertook to
proceed with a more conservative approach focused on capacity building in some sectors
and PFM. A more ambitious and broad approach is nevertheless worth undertaking – and
possibly crucial - in the next CAS with the broad support from other donors.
34.
The mix of instruments was well balanced between SILs, APLs and DPLs, plus
two emergencies operations. The reliance on APLs decreased21 as this instrument was
gradually replaced by PRSCs, notably in social sectors. The three multi-sectoral DPLs
resulted in important impact through strong synergies with specific parallel sector
operations and solid analytical underpinning from sector operations and self-standing
AAA. Two operations deserve special mention. The Public Finance DPO helped make
significant progress in the critical PFM area while contributing to significant
achievements in other areas. The Dakar Diamniadio toll road was a high risk-high
reward, daring and innovative operation. The expected outcomes were generally
realistic. In contrast, in the energy DPO covering the power sector, the governance risks
and the political risks around SENELEC were underestimated and was an outlier despite
the unsatisfactory rating of the Bank engagement in that area (Outcome 3) in the previous
CAS.
35.
The choice of outcome indicators for the results matrix was not entirely adequate:
10 of those were revised at the CASPR and for this CASCR not all indicators of the
revised matrix could be measured properly either. The CAS report was correct in
identifying risks – particularly Senegal’s vulnerability to shocks, governance and
administrative capacity risks. The approaches to mitigate the last two risks appear to
have been chosen correctly: giving more attention to the capacity issue by consolidating
the CAS strategy toward local communities and providing direct support to key sectors
such as education, health, and governance – as a core CAS area of intervention.
36.
The CAS program was more realistic than the Government PRSP-II in terms of
GDP growth. The fact that the high PRSP growth targets and poverty reduction
objectives were not achieved is not a negative indicator of the quality of the CAS
program and performance of the Bank, but a reflection of the magnitude of the shocks
Senegal had to face, and to a lesser extent the appetite for and wavering commitment of
the Government for reforms during the CAS period (and the previous one considering
time lags). The failure to generate more formal jobs reflects not only the lack of strong
economic progress resulting from the repeated shocks since 2006, but also the lack of
transformational changes in the economy and lack of spatial integration, predating this
CAS. A strong drive for spatial integration and deeper/more comprehensive analysis and
concern for all factors of competitiveness of the Senegalese economy should probably
have been forcefully integrated in the Bank’s programs much before 2006.

37.
During this CAS the Bank was particularly proactive in adjusting the program to
changing country circumstances and priorities and leveraging financial resources beyond
the country allocation through partnerships and donor coordination. As shown by the
PFSC and the other operations prepared and approved during 2008-2009, the Bank was
particularly responsive in helping Senegal deal with the challenging circumstances and
mitigate the effects of the risks with the successive shocks materialized. Overall the
Bank has acted in Senegal in a balanced manner in addressing the critical short-term
crisis concerns while maintaining a focus on promoting long-term accelerated and shared
growth.
38.
The Bank’s teams and management paid strong attention to the implementation of
the operations as shown by the quality of portfolio: only one project22 was rated U for
DPO/IP by January 1, 2011. The failure in the electricity sector does not at all reflect
insufficient attention during implementation. Overall supervision of execution of the
program was strengthened further through continued decentralization of implementation
the Dakar office. Concern for effectiveness and focus on development outcomes is
illustrated and well documented in the detailed annexes. Seven out of the 29 non DPL
operations under implementation during the CAS period were restructured. However
M&E was weak in a number of operations and special efforts to correct this were
undertaken with the 2009 CPPR. Although the CAS progress report did not capture well
the changes of some of the outcomes, the CAS had a results framework that was
instrumental in assessing its achievements during the CAS period.
39.
It is too early to assess the impact of most knowledge based activities on the
dialogue and business relations with the authorities, such as the PER and hospital
subsector TA. The Bank and other donors continuously devoted efforts to discussing the
PRSPs (including the draft PRSP-III) and PRSP progress reports with the authorities, but
one still notice a certain disconnect between the PRSP and the authorities annual budget
laws and important parts of the Government investment programs. Dialogue with the
Government on issues requiring increasingly forceful decisions may have been less
productive than hoped for, but was in some instances later facilitated, when Senegal
became confronted with successive shocks.
40.
As shown by the substantial co-financing mobilized on about half of the CAS
operations, the Bank has been successful in leveraging assistance from other donors.
Efforts were particularly dedicated to increase donor coordination in budget support and
PFM. However the perception of the donors and of the population during the last CAS
years was that the Bank had become less vocal and clear in expressing tough messages
and reservations about some Government controversial actions or lack forceful
correctives measure when needed. The Bank used a subdued approach, favoring a
dialogue with Government on the strengthening of institutions of control and PFM. It is
not clear if this change of tack has been more beneficial in terms of long term
development impact.

Lessons learned and suggestions for new CPS
41.
First, long term involvement in one area – spanning two to three CAS periods and substantial partner support by Bank, plus a strong Government commitment and
incentives for changes are key elements to have deep and long lasting development
(specially transformational) impact in such areas (for example water, urban, transport,
PFM, procurement). This argues in favor of the Bank pursuing its engagement in a
number of areas where much remains to be done. Even more so, since the Bank is
generally perceived as an “honest broker,” many donors are more willing to engage in a
sector when the Bank is involved: this can also increase leverage for change.
42.
Second, for the sake of realism and efficiency in designing and later in
implementing a program, the Bank should constantly keep in mind that "what the
government needs to do" may partly (or even very much) differ from "what the
government can do, is ready to do and is fully committed to do." This has been illustrated
with parts of the PPP-supported program and with the lack of success with SENELEC
rehabilitation. During implementation the Bank needs to learn to take tough decisions on
difficult projects by taking adequate remedies (cancellation or refusal to extend closing
dates).
43.
Third, budget support has been an effective tool to mobilize the entire
Government on cross-cutting issues. The case of the road maintenance fund FERA, the
sustainable management of fisheries, public hospitals, and the control of loss-making
autonomous agencies demonstrated increased mobilization and greater involvement of
the line ministries and smoother relation between the Ministry of finances and line
ministries. But successful DPOs need to be underpinned by very solid analytical work
and for multi-sectoral DPOs synergies with sector SIL/TA operations significantly
increase their impact. A combination of several instruments is advisable and is warranted
in strategically selected areas of intervention.
44.
Fourth, attention should be paid to the quality of outcome indicators at the outset,
making sure that these indicators are relevant to the objectives, and that they can be
measured at every step of implementation. It is crucial to align closely performance
indicators for the PRSCs and other operations with those for the PRSP and the CAS.
45.
Based on current trends, Senegal is likely to reach its goals in universal primary
education, the fight against HIV/AIDS, and the urban water sub-sector. However, it will
not reach its MDGs with respect to eradicating extreme poverty, fighting malaria, and
reducing infant and maternal mortality. Senegal faces the insidious risk of stalled growth
– where growth stalls at around the still high rate of population growth. A higher growth
rate of 7 percent and beyond will be necessary to reach the MDGs, particularly to reduce
substantially poverty. Such growth will need to be driven even more now by broadening
private sector activity. Fostering strong growth will require sustained transformational
changes in the economy.
46.
For the next CAS, a guiding Bank principle should be to continue to be or become
engaged where there is potential for transformative change and Bank interventions can

66

have demonstration effects that trigger greater change. Given the vulnerability of
Senegal to shocks, flexibility and responsiveness will continue to be needed to assist
Senegal when it is actually faced with renewed shocks. The Bank engagements in many
areas will be needed that address immediate issues but at the same time tackle longstanding structural problem.
47.
Reducing Senegal’s vulnerability will be paramount. A comprehensive set of
effective safety nets and coherent targeting mechanism will be needed to better protect
vulnerable groups. Broader analytical work on Senegal’s competitiveness would be
appropriate to determine additional initiatives to accelerate Senegal’s economic growth.
Most areas of current engagement deserve continuing support with possibly less
concentration of infrastructure than in the current CAS. Areas of support in the next CPS
could include (i) leveraging agribusiness potential, (ii) consolidating reforms in energy,
(iii) strengthening territorial management and spatial integration by promoting
development along corridors, and (iv) social sectors. More attention could be given to
population growth issues and to an all-across the board modernization of the
administration.

Outcome 5: Independent
audit of all Government
procurement transactions to
be carried out by ARMP
(Procurement Regulatory
Agency) - on annual basis
for preceding year

Achieved: Government had an audit of procurement transactions in
09 carried out with support of PIPP. It uncovered a number of
significant irregularities. ARMP cancelled over 20 procurement cases
not in abeyance with procurement code.

Procurement regulatory and institutional framework and capacity
management have considerably improved with the long-standing
program of support by the Bank (DPOs and other operations). A new
Procurement Law was adopted in 2006 which complies with the
WAEMU’s Procurement Directives and a new procurement code was
approved by the Government in April 2007. A Public Procurement
Regulatory Authority, Agence de Régulation des Marchés Publics
(ARMP), an autonomous and independent structure, was created and
is operational. The National Procurement Department (DCMP) was
set up to ensure appropriate internal controls of procurement
transactions handled by the contracting authorities. Quality of
Senegal National Procurement System got 2.46 score on 3 (max)
according to 2008 OECD/DAC assessment. Percentage of total sole
source contracts reduced from 80% in 2006 to 14% in 2009.

PRSC III prior actions included: Adoption of the legal instruments
needed for implementation of the new Procurement Code and the

Progress in improving functioning of the justice sector has been slow.

Under the PIPP a sector expenditure program for justice had been

PSJ) adopted (2004). Activities financed under PIPP included the
establishment of a Center for Arbitration, Mediation, and
Conciliation, which, as of mid-2008, has arbitrated 26 commercial
disputes, including a case of a commercial dispute worth over US$60
million in contracts.

EGP The objective of this very recent project is to
improve aspects of the functioning of the justice sector
relevant to the investment climate. Key expected
outcomes: enhanced effectiveness of justice (number of
cases judged and speed at which they are judged);
improved investment climate (number of commercial

Pillar I: growth / wealth creation

Promoting a competitive investment climate

Outcome 1: Reduce by 30
percent the time and cost to
(i) register a business and
(ii) register a property by
FY10

Achieved. As of 2010, the number of days to register cut down from
58 to 8 with the creation of one-stop shop for registration. The
number of days to register a property was still 220 days in 2009 but
according to the Government’s October 2010 PRSP II
Implementation Completion & Diagnosis Report (ICDR), it has
dropped to 17 days.
Both components of the outcome were covered by PIPP prior actions
under reduction of administrative barriers.

Intermediate outcome
Reduce the number of days to
registering a business to less
than 10 by end-2010 and
number of days to registering
a property to less than 120

Regarding other aspects of the investment climate, the results are also
encouraging (despite the low PIPP rating): Senegal ranked 146 of 181
countries but still best reformer in Africa in 2009 DB. It registered a
slight decline to 152 in 2011 DB. APIX (investment promotion
agency) has been charged by Government with programming reforms

PIPP
Overall progress towards DPO and IP of PIPP rated

Annex 6: Gender in Senegal
Senegal has a history of political support for women and has made significant strides
toward gender equality during the latest PRSP and CAS period, in particular regard to
political representation and maternal health. With an annual decrease of nearly 10% in child
mortality (under five years of age) in recent years Senegal is leading what has been called the
“biggest development success in development.” Linked to this are significant improvements in
maternal health, represented by a mortality rate which fell from 430 women dying per 100.000
live births in 2005 to 370 in 2010. In 2011, the proportion of seats held by women in parliament
was 22.7% and thus above the regional average; and the rate may increase after the July 1, 2012
election, which, for the first time in West Africa, applied a law of absolute gender parity in
electoral lists. Gender parity has also improved in education at all levels, although the gap
remains large at secondary (ratio of 79.4) and tertiary levels (ratio of 59.5).
Still, women continue to live and work at a disadvantage to their male counterparts, which
suggest that it will be relevant for the newly elected leadership to continue focusing on a
responsive policy reform to ensure that women are able to realize their economic potential
and contribute fully to the country’s continued development. Overall improvements for
gender parity in education have not yet caught up with a huge gender gap in literacy rates, where
the ratio between female and males is 0.63 and among the lowest in the world; and the gap
remains a major factor in regard to women’s economic participation. Only 66% of women
participate in the labor force against 88% men, and 83% of women work in the informal sector.
Only 10% of permanent full time workers are female, which is less than half of the average in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is difficult for both young women and men to enter the job market,
but more so for women. Even among the labor force with tertiary education, men are twice as
likely as women to be employed in the formal private sector. The majority of women (83%)
work in the Agricultural sector, but they own only about 13% of agricultural lands since
customary practices related to land ownership continue to limit women’s access to land. At the
household level, the need to compensate for lack of access to electricity forces women and girls
to invest considerable time in non-income generating activities such as collecting water and
firewood and milling grained food. The Government suggests that these activities keep women
and girls impoverished. Furthermore, fundamental obstacles to the achievement of gender
equality at the level of agency continue to exist, including widespread gender-based violence
and, despite improvements, under-representation of women at all levels of public decisionmaking.
The Gender Portfolio Review finds great opportunity for the new CAS to make a
significant contribution to national goals for attention to gender, including those expressed
in the DPES 2011-2015 and all four thematic priority areas of the National Strategy on Equity
and Gender Equality (SNEEG). Specifically, the Review finds grounds for the new CAS to
support select national priorities as follows:
1.
SNEEG priority: Enhancement of the social position of women and strengthening of
its potential
CAS activities/contribution/targets:

96

 Promote equality of access, opportunity, success and completion at primary and tertiary
levels of education; and considerations for the different needs of males and females in these
levels of education (Senegal Tertiary Education and Financing for Results; Education For All
Fast Track Initiative; Water and Sanitation Millennium Project).
 Contribute to males’ and females’ access to water and sanitation, and maternal health
services, and reduce the risk of nutrition insecurity for children under five through targeted
service and cash transfers to valuable mothers. (Nutrition Enhancement program II; Rapid
Response Child Focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security Project; Water and
Sanitation Millennium Project; Education for All Fast Track Initiative).
2.

SNEEG priority: Economic Advancement of women in rural and urban areas.

CAS activities/contribution/targets:
 Broaden the scope of interventions for women to increase their economic opportunities
through increased access to labor markets, capacity building and access to grant facilities.
Specifically, this will involve analytical work focused on young males’ and females’ access to
labor markets (several sectors will contribute) and operational work targeting: i) females’
involvement in the charcoal production chain, including training and employment as potters
of ceramic cook stoves; ii) increased employment opportunities for men and women
respectively in the fishing industry; iii) grants to women’s associations in support of
economically viable actives in the Casamance area and increased income for women in
agriculture through an agriculture markets grant mechanism; iv) increased access to irrigated
areas for women’s cooperatives; and v) provision of business and technical skills training
services to males and females. (Agriculture Markets and Agribusiness Development Project;
Agribusiness Development and Finance Project; Senegal River Basin Multi-Purpose Water
Resources Development Project; Casamance Integrated Growth Pole Project; West Africa
Fisheries Program; PROGEDE II)
3.
SNEEG priority: Promoting equitable exercise of rights and duties of women and men
and enhancing access and position of women in the spheres of decision making.
CAS activities/contribution/targets:
 Promote gender equal participation in local public decision making related to rural
energy, management of local water user associations and, urban flood risk management
institutions (ASER; PROGEDE II; Water and Sanitation Millennium Project; Stormwater
Management Project).
 Socio-economic research on select gender disaggregated impacts of violent conflict in the
Casamance area (Casamance Integrated Growth Pole Project).
4.
SNEEG priority: Improving the impact of interventions in favor of equality and gender
equity.
CAS activities/contribution/targets:

97

 Activities that target increased capacity to promote gender equality would, for example,
include support to improved national capacity for gender monitoring and analysis of data
related to mothers’ access to health care and nutrition services; and training of men and
women in conflict transformation. (Senegal Nutrition: Strengthening Operational Evaluation
in Program Implementation Initiative; Casamance Integrated Growth Pole) Project).
 During the CAS, the World Bank’s overall contribution to the promotion of gender
equality in Senegal will be measured though the level of gender informed design of the IDA
project portfolio. The review finds that at the beginning of the new CAS, 75% of the IDA
portfolio is gender informed (meaning that gender is considered in the analysis, action or
monitoring of the projects), which thus represent the 2012 baseline for the CAS. The overall
gender objectives for the new CAS period could be to:
 Maintain the high baseline level of a 75% gender informed IDA portfolio (a suggested
indicator for the CAS Results Matrix); and
 Further increase the policy dialog on gender with the support of diagnostic work in select
priority areas and increased attention to evaluation of impacts of interventions on priority
gender inequality areas.
To further strengthen the support to gender equality during the new CAS; to support
operational effectiveness through ongoing and planned analytical and policy dialog; and to
strengthen alignment with the Africa Gender Strategy; the review specifically suggests that
non-lending gender priority activities include:


A gender informed National Poverty Assessment.

 Analysis and dialog on youth employment that take into consideration gender inequalities
in relations to, for example, access, wage and training.


A policy notes series for the new Government that addresses key gender inequality areas.

 Impact evaluation work will specifically address gender inequality areas related to
women’s access to economic opportunities.
These recommendations for the non-lending program are very much in line with the ongoing and
planned analytical and policy work program. Finally, it is suggested that the country team
consider institutionalizing a systematic approach to reviewing new projects for their attention to
gender, by making gender a standard agenda item at PCN meetings, and by increasingly
addressing gender in the social review process, which may involve attention to capacity
development of social safeguard staff.

98

Annex 7: Senegal CPS Translation of Updated GAC Strategy Priorities
Strengthening Country Systems and Institutions: The Senegal CPS is closely aligned with the
Government’s own program, the SNDES, in which governance features prominently and
supports country institutions wherever possible. The CPS takes an integrated approach to
governance, including activities in the public sector, the financial sector (investment climate), the
judicial sector, and the service delivery sectors, while simultaneously addressing a specific area
of fragility through development activities in the volatile Casamance Region. Ongoing regional
initiatives, such as the WAEMU guidelines in the area of Public Financial Management and
Procurement, also support this approach. In terms of instruments, the CPS also moves towards
progressively strengthening country systems by proposing results-based operations
(DPL/P4R/SWAPS) relying on country systems combined with TA components to support and
accompany the reforms.
Strengthening Core Country Systems and Sector Institutions: Bank assistance through the CPS
will aim to strengthen both core country systems of governance and sector institutions
responsible for service delivery. Thus, governance interventions are proposed both at the central
level of government (Premature and Ministry of Finance) and in specific areas of service
delivery, such as land and water management, performance agreements for hospitals, or the
sustainable governance of fisheries resources. The Bank will also support the Government in the
allocation and effectiveness of expenditures in various sectors.
Promoting Transparency and Openness: Transparency and openness are an important priority for
the new Government. The new CPS is based on substantive consultations to ensure that client
feedback from civil society and other stakeholders is effectively taken into account in the new
program. Going forward, the Bank will continue to promote a transparent approach, e.g., by
using the Bank’s convening power to bring various development stakeholders together or by
using the Bank’s Disclosure Policy to actively communicate Bank programs and results to
beneficiaries. Several programs will allow for beneficiary feedback mechanisms. ICT tools will
be integrated in some of the approaches, as appropriate. The Bank intends to collaborate closely
with the democratically elected Parliament as the link between citizens throughout the territory
and Government programs. On the Government side, the CPS promotes transparency through
several activities, including the more timely publication of reports of the Court of Auditors and
support to asset declarations of public officials.
Focusing on Results: The CPS will put a strong emphasis on results. Internally, the CPS results
matrix will allow for a consistent monitoring of CPS outcomes, including in the area of
governance. Among others, the efforts in the results area can build and expand on the service
delivery indicators and performance contracts developed in some sectors. At the central level as
well, the CPS will support a strategic program to strengthen Government capacity for policy
planning and monitoring & evaluation in order to support the more effective implementation of
Government programs responding to the aspirations of citizens.

99

Managing Fiduciary Risks: In line with the GAC Strategy, the Senegal CPS promotes an
approach that manages rather than avoids risks while maintaining the highest fiduciary standards
to protect development results and Bank investments. To that effect, all Bank activities will work
in close cooperation with the Bank’s fiduciary and procurement teams to ensure that funds are
used for their intended purposes. While taking a calculated approach to risks a priori, the team
will take strong and effective measures in collaboration with INT, should allegations or actual
cases of fraud and corruption occur.

100

Annex 8: Regional Integration
Broadening Senegal’s Markets and Leveraging Resources
Regional integration is a key part of the CPS, with five ongoing projects and two new projects
and two potential projects. The existing regional integration agenda demonstrates the power of
intra-regional exchanges for inclusive growth and shared prosperity across sectors such as
energy, agriculture, fisheries, water management and the financial sector. Twenty percent of
Senegal’s exports are intra-regional to Mali (15.8) and Guinea (4.8), highlighting the importance
of regional integration. As Senegal moves to diversify its energy mix, it will increasingly rely on
regional sources for electricity. The CPS would continue to find opportunities to leverage
regional projects in an attempt to deepen integration leverage additional IDA funding and build
knowledge across the region. Some of the regional projects include:
Regional Operations (size in millions of US dollars)

Senegal is active on several regional tracks including the management of the Senegal River
Basin which is shared with Mauritania, Mali and Guinea. The Senegal River Basin
Organization (OMVS) has traditionally played a lead role in facilitating regional integration.
The development of the Senegal River is critical for Senegal because 60 percent of the country’s
water resources are dependent on the Senegal River. In addition, through the joint management
of the Senegal River, Senegal benefits from the infrastructure assets and the associated
multipurpose benefits which it could not develop alone. For example, the Felou hydropower
project supported by the Bank. As relates to the joint management of the Senegal River basin,
priorities include the: (i) development of hydropower dams (Gouina, Koukoutamba and
Boureya); (ii) strengthening of transportation links such as the Rosso Bridge and navigation of
the Senegal River; (iii) development of irrigated agriculture; and (iv) modernization of systems
for climate change adaptation. The Bank has also supported feasibility studies for further
hydropower development through its regional water management project with OMVS. In
addition, with the OMVS project, the incidence of malaria has been appreciably reduced with 3
million bed nets provided to the population living in the basin. The OMVS has also generated
101

substantial economic benefits at the local level through investments in the agriculture and
fisheries sectors, and this has helped to improve the livelihoods of the communities living in the
Basin.
In the Financial sector, there is an important regional initiative with the BCEAO on
payment services and systems in UEMOA. The project is financed by the FIRST Initiative and
will help BCEAO implement some of the key recommendations of a World Bank study on
"Lowering the Cost of Payments and Money Transfers in UEMOA" (2011) regarding usage of
mobile phone technology and other innovations to promote financial inclusion in the region. The
BCEAO has also requested IFC assistance to develop a regional credit bureau covering all
UEMOA countries. This project has the potential to greatly improve access to finance in the
region.
In terms of business environment, the Improved Investment Climate within OHADA project
aims to strengthen OHADA's institutional capacity to support, in its member countries,
selected aspects of investment climate reforms, including improved corporate financial reporting.
The activities financed with this IDA grant are related to institutional cooperation for greater
economic integration by harmonizing all business and commercial laws in the OHADA Zone.
Under the umbrella of FIAS Investment Climate Advisory Services Program, IFC project
#553006 has been supporting OHADA member countries since 2007 in modernizing the
OHADA laws ("Uniform Acts"). IFC intends to develop this project further (through the project
#592087) to continue with the reform process as well as the follow-up activities to ensure the
implementation of these laws and translate the regulatory changes into concrete improvements
on the ground for the private sector. Going forward, as a member of OHADA, Senegal is
expected to benefit from ongoing reforms of the Uniform OHADA Act (assisted by the IFC and
the WB).
In the Fisheries sector, the Bank (with GEF co-financing) is supporting the West Africa
Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP) through a series of 3 overlapping Adaptable
Program Loans (APLs). Taken together, this series of APLs (i.e., the WARFP) will cover all
seven member countries of the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (Cape Verde, the Gambia,
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone) plus Liberia and Ghana. This
overlapping design will encourage regional integration in the sustainable management and
development of the region’s marine fish resources. The development objective of the WARFP is
to sustainably increase the overall wealth generated by the exploitation of the targeted marine
fish resources in the participating countries, and the proportion of that wealth captured by these
countries. The first ongoing APL in the series, APL-A, involves Cape-Verde, Liberia, SierraLeone and Senegal.
Senegal will be part of the Higher Education Africa Centers of Excellence project which
seeks to promote regional specialization among participating universities within areas that
address particular common regional development challenges and strengthen the capacities
of these universities to deliver high quality training and applied research. The higher order
objective of the project is to meet the demand for skills required for Africa's development, such
as the growing energy sector, extractive industries and agriculture productivity. Further, the
project would contribute to the strengthening of the best African universities within science
based education such as natural sciences, hard sciences, life sciences and applied associated

102

disciplines. Benefits for Senegal include: (i) universities with a stronger attachment in areas of
national strategic interest, including agriculture, transport, power and extractive industries; (ii)
strengthened university capacities in the hard, life and natural sciences, engineering and
technology, in order to be able to produce quality specialized skilled labor and applied research
within these disciplines and cater to national strategic sectors. This would provide an important
boost to Senegal’s aspirations to become a regional hub for higher education and become a
targeted complementary support to the Tertiary Education Governance and Financing for Results
project.

103

Annex 9: Partnerships
Bank support to governance and public sector performance is complementary to other
partners’ activities. PFM is supported through the budget support group, which meets on a
regular basis and has agreed on a PFM action plan with the authorities. Other partners active in
PFM reforms include in particular the European Union, the French Cooperation, and UNDP
Development Strategy and Public Finance Pool. In the area of monitoring and evaluation, Bank
support to strengthening government policy monitoring and decision making is complementary
to other partners’ activities at the sector level. In the area of civil service, the EU and UNDP
have active TA programs which complement Bank activities. Support to the justice sector is led
by the EU and the French Cooperation, and the EU is also supporting civil registry and
Parliament and checks and balances institutions. In the area of procurement, in addition to the
World Bank, AfDB, the EU and WAEMU provide support.
There is a significant donor involvement in Agriculture and PSD related activities in Senegal,
either for pure business environment and finance activities, or less traditional actions in agro
industry/agriculture. The AfDB is supporting agribusiness and access to finance, while the
French Cooperation is building capacity of Rural Communities (PACR project). The AfDB is
implementing a Food Security Support Project in the Louga, Matam and Kaffrine regions, which
aims to increase sustainable crop and animal productions and improve small producers’ incomes.
The project will finance water infrastructure, particularly irrigation, as well as services and
innovative crop production technologies. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is also
active in the agriculture sector with a Food Security Program/Promotion of local rice.
USAID is providing technical assistance on agribusiness, and also recently published a
report on “Doing Agribusiness.” Under the umbrella of the “Feed the Future” initiative,
USAID’s Economic Growth Project (EGO) supports Senegal’s Accelerated Growth Strategy
(SCA) and the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Program (CAADP). The project aims to boost
investment in the agriculture sector and to significantly increase the contribution of agriculture to
the national economy. The Irrigation and Water Resource Management Project aims to
contribute to increased agricultural productivity in the Senegal River valley through: (i)
increased volume of water for irrigation; (ii) increased irrigated lands; (3) reduced risk of
abandonment of existing irrigated land. The project also supports a land tenure component that
will provide local governments with adapted land registers and records.
Given the importance of the energy sector for the country, many donors are involved in
energy activities. The AfDB is promoting private sector investment for a 125 MW coal power
plant; and the Agence Francaise du Development is assisting SENELEC in the rehabilitation of
power generation assets. KfW is focusing on the promotion of wind energy in Senegal, as well
as rural electrification projects; the European Union is expected to increasingly contribute to
rural electrification; the Chinese EXIM Bank is financing distribution improvements and
containerized generation plants; and Korean development programs are promoting a 250MW
coal power plant.
In the fisheries sector, JICA, the European Union, FAO, AFD, and USAID are all active.
JICA supports local fisheries management activities in other pilot sites along the Senegalese
coast, similar to the model financed by the GIRMaC. The EU supports Fisheries Monitoring,

104

Control and surveillance activities at the regional level, and finances the establishment of
sustainable management plans for some fisheries. FAO financed studies on institutional and
legal reforms to be implemented to support the success of the letter of sector policy, support the
development of aquaculture and the ecosystem approach in fisheries, and supports the capacity
building of women in artisanal fish processing. AFD supports the co-management and
integration of marine protected areas for the fisheries management at the regional level in West
Africa, and USAID supports the improvement of the governance of the fisheries via communitybased management.
In the urban sector, AFD, EU, the EIB and the BOAD are particularly involved in the
water sector, with direct loans to SONES to enhance the production and distribution of
water in secondary cities. AFD and EIB are more involved in the sanitation sector, through the
project to clean up the Bay of Hann, and funding for the sanitation plan of Dakar by the EIB. The
EU finances the construction of infrastructure in five secondary cities; JICA is involved recently
in the city of Kaolack through the development of a sanitation master plan; and the Gates
Foundation supports ONAS on sludge treatment with the implementation of several such
stations.
In the rural sector, the approaches of different donors are similar, with the construction of
wells and water supply facilities accompanied by the establishment of ASUFORs to manage
and operate the infrastructure associated with hygiene and sanitation components (hygiene
awareness, construction of latrines). ADB, USAID, BTC, Lux Dev and JICA have interventions
in rural areas where they are traditionally active, complementing IDA’s activities, which are
concentrated on the north along the Senegal River. The whole sector is well-coordinated with
consultation and coordination meetings with the Senegalese authorities, and AFD and the EU
providing co-chair of urban and BTC Lux Dev and co-chair of the rural sectors. The World
Bank/WSP provides the secretariat for these two subgroups: French Development Agency
(AFD) and Support Project for Rural Communities (PACR). The project aims to support the
Senegal River Delta rural communities in evaluating their land potential and promoting local
development with productive investments.
At the operational level, Senegal has also fostered constructive partnerships between local
government, civil society and the private sector for improved health and nutrition outcomes.
Under the World Bank supported Nutrition Enhancement Program, central and local government
have entered in formal partnerships with civil society organizations, public service delivery
systems and the private sector for improved food, nutrition and health outcomes. Through these
partnerships at the operational level, Senegal has reduced chronic malnutrition, the principal
marker of non-income poverty, to 16% (2012) and doubled the production and consumption of
iodized salt and major staple foods fortified with essential micronutrients such as vitamin A and
iron. Additional areas under these operational partnership arrangements will focus on food
transformation and conservation, and maternal mortality reduction.

Annex 10: Lessons from a Failed Energy Sector Credit
In June 2008, IDA approved a two-tranche Energy Sector Recovery Development Policy Credit
for US$80 million equivalent. The objective was to ensure the sound long-term development of
electricity services and supply of petroleum products through the restoration of the financial
equilibrium of Senelec and policy measures to improve governance at Senelec and the refinery
(SAR). Two years later it closed without releasing the second tranche. The ICRR concluded that
Bank performance had been moderately unsatisfactory while the borrower’s performance was
judged unsatisfactory. What happened and what lessons were learned?
The project was hampered by the exceptional rise in world oil prices in 2008 and an economic
slowdown due partly to the global financial crisis. However, the ICRR also admitted that the
project was overly ambitious, expecting significant improvements in a short period of time. It
failed to take into account the Bank’s recommendations regarding conditionality in DPCs such as
i) ensuring ownership at the Ministry of Energy and Senelec; ii) balancing the conditionalities
and financing between tranches; iii) choosing only actions critical to achieving results as
conditions; and iv) choosing the right instruments to effect changes in Senelec’s financial
situation. Instead, the project was managed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The
second tranche had eleven fairly difficult conditions, some of which were not critical, but only
30 percent of the funding. And a two-year DPC was too short and inflexible to resolve Senelec’s
financial problems. At the same time, the government found itself caught between continuing
unsustainable budget transfers or increasing already high tariffs in a context of weak service
provision. It was unwilling to take difficult decisions on tariffs, policy reforms, or the
governance of sector entities.
The ICRR concluded that in future it would be important to use a longer series of DPCs with
more modest objectives, greater flexibility, supported by an investment credit. Greater ownership
at the sector level and better coordination between the sector and finance ministry would also be
critical.

107

Annex 11: The FY 11 Senegal Country Survey – Summary of Findings
The FY 11 Senegal Country Survey results provide insight into the views and perceptions of
stakeholders in Senegal. Because a survey was conducted in FY 07, there are some differences
to report in terms of how stakeholders perceive aspects of the Bank’s work now compared to
several years ago. In addition, it is interesting to note how stakeholders identify the key
priorities for the country and where the Bank can add most value.
It is worth noting that familiarity with the Bank is quite low outside of the bi-lateral/multi-lateral
stakeholder group (i.e., 4.6 on a ten point scale for employees of ministries). As with all other
countries, there is a correlation between familiarity and positive views of the Bank; it would be
worth considering how to improve familiarity in a way that does not translate into blanket
outreach, but rather targeted and strategic relationship building, information and knowledge
sharing, partnerships, etc.
Overall context
Stakeholders identify governance/transparency as the top development priority in the country.
Employment and public/private investment also emerge as top priorities as related to reducing
poverty and economic growth. The Country Survey findings suggest that approximately one
quarter of stakeholders believe that the Bank is emphasizing public investment, private
investment, and governance and transparency.
The largest percentage of respondents think the Bank should emphasize employment, followed
by development opportunities beyond Dakar, governance, energy and agriculture.
Overall views of the World Bank
More than six out of ten respondents believe the Bank should be more involved in Senegal’s
development strategies. As reported in FY 07, the Bank continues to be most valued for its
financial resources, followed by its knowledge. However, its greatest weakness continues to be
that it is perceived to impose technocratic solutions without regard to political realities. It is
interesting to note that more than a third of respondents report that there is not enough public
disclosure of its work (this will be interesting to track over time in light of the Bank’s Access and
Open Data policies); more than a third report that it is too influenced by donor countries’ and a
third notes that the Bank is too bureaucratic.
Overall effectiveness of the Bank
Ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in Senegal have remained constant at 6.2 on a ten point
scale. The highest ratings come from development partners (bi-laterals and multi-laterals) and
stakeholders from independent government institutions. The lowest ratings come from
academia, NGOs, the media and the office of the President. This is worth noting because these
can be very vocal constituencies; assessing these relationships and working to improve their
perceptions (through outreach, knowledge sharing, etc.) is worth considering.

108

Perceptions of the Bank’s work in a number of areas have improved significantly. These include
agriculture development, public sector, environment and natural resource management, reducing
corruption in the country, urban quality of life, and social protection (although these last two are
considered areas where the Bank is least effective currently).
How the Bank works
The survey suggests that the greatest frustration with the Bank is related to procurement and the
complexity of obtaining financing. Ratings on the Bank’s procurement requirements have
diminished significantly since FY 07. Having said that, ratings have improved significantly for
how efficiently the Bank works and for the monitoring and evaluation of programs and projects
it supports.
Regarding collaboration, the Bank is perceived to have improved in terms of how it collaborates
with government partners on Bank supported efforts in the country. Ratings have gone down
significantly for the way the Bank collaborates with donors (note: the question is worded slightly
differently and the ratings are still relatively positive).
The Bank’s knowledge
It is interesting to note that when asked where the Bank should focus its knowledge and research,
stakeholders identify education as the top area, followed by poverty, agriculture and energy. It is
worth noting that other than agriculture, these areas are not considered top development priority
areas in Senegal. It is worth exploring how the Bank’s knowledge and research in key priority
areas can be better shared with, and valued by, stakeholders in the country.
The Bank’s communication
It is critical to bring attention to the survey’s finding that usage of the World Bank’s website has
gone down from 89% in FY 07 to 75% today. The Bank’s website is a key access point to the
organization’s knowledge, research, etc. If fewer people are using it, it would be critical to
understand why. The survey findings suggest that it is not related to how navigable the site is or
whether they can find the information they need. Perhaps it is related to translation or that they
are going elsewhere for information.
