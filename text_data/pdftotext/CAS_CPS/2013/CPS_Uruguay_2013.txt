I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This Progress Report assesses the implementation of the 2010-2015 joint Bank-IFC
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Oriental Republic of Uruguay'. The CPS
focuses on four pillars: i) reducing macroeconomic vulnerability and strengthening public sector
administration; ii) competitiveness and infrastructure; iii) agriculture, climate change and
environment; and iv) increasing social inclusion and equity.
2.
The CPS was prepared to support the priorities of the Government. Its
implementation has been marked by increasing external economic uncertainty. The CPS
period largely coincides with the 5-year Government cycle starting in March 2010. The CPS
supports the Government's reform program aimed at consolidating progress on economic
stability and growth, while making economic expansion more sustainable and equitable. The
program was kept flexible based on past experience with unexpected occurrences of economic
and other shocks in the country. This flexibility has enabled adaptation of the Bank Group's
program to the increasing global and regional economic uncertainty over the past years and
support for the Government's proactive strategy of precautionary financing, which aims to
protect vulnerable groups from a reversal of their modest welfare improvement in the event of
external shocks.
3.
The guiding principle established for the CPS - a focus on innovation and results has been adhered to during implementation. To ensure that Bank Group support adds value to
national programs pertaining to the four CPS pillars, it was agreed to select activities that help
access global knowledge and expertise and introduce innovative solutions to complex
development challenges. This principle has been adhered to in CPS implementation: a
considerable amount of new financing was delivered through innovative and results-based
instruments, most notably contingent financing through DPL/DDOs 2 and the new Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (P125803), the first Program for Results (PforR) in the
Region. The latter leveraged total financing of over US$500 million from the Government
budget and from other external financiers with IBRD contribution of US$66 million. This was
accompanied by an increasing emphasis on knowledge generation and sharing.
4.
Sound macroeconomic policies and a favorable external environment have
produced sustained high growth, which has become more broad-based. A remarkably fast
rebound from the 2008/2009 global financial crisis was registered, with growth rates averaging
6.2 percent in 2010-2012, continuing a historic trend of 10 years of consecutive economic
growth. Growth has become more inclusive as incomes of the bottom 40 percent have grown at a
faster rate than mean income. This is a reflection of general income growth of these groups as
well as improved coverage and targeting of social programs.
5.
There have been advances on structural reforms, albeit at different speeds.
Efficiency of public sector management was increased through measures such as the gradual

introduction of results-based budgeting. Progress was also made on enhancing competitiveness
in areas like customs and logistics management, including the introduction of a regulatory
framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) 3. However, this has not been sufficient to fully
address the capacity gap between an aging infrastructure and the needs of an expanding
economy. Similarly, there remain important challenges in other areas, notably secondary
education.
6.
Overall, the implementation of the CPS has been effective in helping consolidate
gains in poverty reduction and shared prosperity, and there has been significant progress
towards meeting CPS outcomes. Important CPS objectives have already been achieved, such as
those of reducing macroeconomic vulnerability, improving water and sanitation services,
strengthening climate change mitigation capacity, and consolidating social protection reforms. In
areas like enhancing transport infrastructure and non-communicable disease prevention, progress
has been less pronounced, though core outcomes are on track to be met by the end of the CPS
period. Through this Progress Report, the authorities and the Bank have agreed on a revision of
the results matrix to adjust it to the current context.
7.
IFC support to the private sector has led to job creation, higher Government
revenues, and improved economic opportunities for local economic actors. This includes in
particular medium- and small-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and farmers. As of end-201 1, IFC
operations in Uruguay are supporting close to 3000 jobs, of which 600 are held by women. Close
to 8000 farmers and 10,000 MSMEs are reached through IFC clients. IFC investments generated
$16 million in government revenues and close to $400 million for domestic suppliers.
8.
No significant further modifications to the CPS program are proposed, and the
second half of the CPS period offers an opportunity to consolidate progress on its
implementation. Bank efforts will focus on implementing the existing portfolio and delivering
high quality knowledge, advisory and convening services, effectively responding to Government
needs. IFC will continue to serve the four focus areas of financial services, agribusiness,
competiveness and education. Together with the Bank, IFC will support the implementation of
the PPP legal and regulatory framework, in areas such as transport, waste management,
renewable energy and natural gas, and explore a potential engagement at the municipal level.
9.
The forthcoming political transition period provides an opportunity to deepen
diagnostic work on Uruguay's medium- to long-term challenges. Presidential elections are
scheduled for October 2014, and the new Government will start its term in March 2015.
Diagnostic work conducted in close collaboration with the Government and other partners would
create a solid analytical basis to help the incoming administration formulate its policy priorities.
It would also inform the renewal and further strengthening of the Bank Group's program in the
forthcoming CPS cycle.
10.
An increase in global economic uncertainty is the main source of change in program
risk since adoption of the CPS, yet Uruguay's mitigation capacity has also increased.
Compared to the outset of the CPS period, Eurozone instability and other global and regional
Law No.18.786 dated July 19, 2011.

economic developments have raised the probability of a reversal of the currently rather favorable
external economic environment of Uruguay. This threatens important gains made in social
mobility, in particular income gains of the bottom 40 percent of the distribution, in reducing
poverty and in eliminating extreme poverty. However, there have been significant improvements
in reducing the country's vulnerability to external economic shocks, as evidenced by Uruguay's
return to Investment Grade status in early 20124
II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
11.
Three years after taking office in March 2010, the Government has made important
progress on most of its policy priorities. The coalition Government under President Mujica has
adhered to the principle of consolidating macroeconomic stability and sustaining economic
growth while strengthening and expanding social programs in support of vulnerable groups.
Among the important reform achievements over the past years, the following stand out: i)
strengthening social protection policies aimed at enhancing targeting of benefits to the most
vulnerable households; ii) gradual implementation of a health insurance scheme leading to
universal coverage with sustainable financing; iii) introduction of results-oriented budgeting that
allocates public resources more effectively to priority areas; iv) a thorough customs reform to
facilitate trade; and v) an E-government agenda aimed at simplifying administrative processes
and improving accessibility through online tools.
12.
These structural advances combined with solid macroeconomic policies and
favorable external economic conditions have resulted in a strong economic performance.
2012 was the tenth consecutive year of GDP growth, marking one of the longest growth periods
in the country's history. Due to the less favorable economic environment in the final months of
the year, however, economic activity slowed down in 2012 to a growth rate of real GDP of 3.9
percent, close to its potential growth rate of 4 percent. It is projected that the economy will keep
expanding at a rate close to 4 percent over the coming years.
13.
Concerted efforts have led to a significant reduction of Uruguay's vulnerability to
external shocks, in particular regarding public finances. The Government's pre-cautionary
financing strategy has helped build up considerable fiscal reserves to respond in the event that
Uruguay loses access to global capital markets. Effective public debt management has resulted in
debt sustainability ceasing to constitute a major medium-term concern for Uruguay. Gross public
debt declined from 76 percent of GDP in 2009 to 62.2 percent in December 2012. The debt
profile has also improved noticeably following a reduction of the share of foreign currency
denominated debt and an increase in the share of fixed-rate instruments.
14.
The medium term outlook remains solid, but challenges remain for economic
policies. There are good prospects for Uruguay meeting these challenges effectively:
* A fiscal deterioration observed in 2012 (primary fiscal surplus fell from 2.0 percent of
GDP in 2011 to -0.2 percent), to a large degree due to transitory factors such as a large
energy deficit due to low rainfall and high financing costs related to the precautionary
Standard and Poor's (April 2012), Moody's (July 2012), Fitch (March 2013) and DBRS (May 2013) upgraded
Uruguay's credit rating to investment grade, which it had lost in early 2002.

financing strategy and market interventions to support to local currency. It is expected
that this will revert to a positive fiscal trend from 2013 onwards.
Lower external price competitiveness and a buoyant internal demand that boosted
imports, mainly fuel and capital imports for large investments projects, have led to the
current account deficit reaching 5.3 percent of GDP at end-2012, up from 1.9 percent in
2010. The current account deficit is likely to increase further in 2013, but should stabilize
towards the end of the CPS period. The growth rate of imports is expected to decrease as
economic growth stabilizes at lower rates and pulp mill construction comes to an end.
Exports should accelerate, largely on account of stronger economic performance of
trading partners and significant exports resulting from major foreign investment projects
coming on-stream.
Strong domestic demand and high commodity prices led to a rise in CPI annual inflation
to 8.1 percent (period average) in 2012 and 2011, compared to 6.7 percent in 2010. In
order to curb inflation, the Central Bank increased the monetary policy rate several times
and increased marginal reserve requirements. The combination of high CPI inflation and
currency appreciation, caused mainly by large capital inflows, has led to a loss of external
price competitiveness. Macroeconomic policies face trade-offs between further monetary
tightening and avoiding a substantial currency appreciation. This will be facilitated by the
expected stabilization of internal demand at lower levels.

15.
Maintaining and eventually increasing the growth rate in the medium and long term
will require addressing several important growth constraints. After several years of
significant expansion, there are signs that future growth rates will depend on increasing
productivity and addressing emerging capacity constraints. Enhancing infrastructure investments,
most notably in different modes of transport, and human resources, by improving the education
system and linking it better to the needs of the economy, are particularly important in this regard.

The Government's growth strategy, further refined in the current CPS period,
recognizes these challenges. This strategy focuses on:
* Turning Uruguay into a sub-regional logistics hub and promoting non-traditional, high
value exports in areas such as logistics services, software or agro-related biotechnology.
* Further enhancing the resilience of the economy against shocks, including through the
pre-cautionary financing strategy and policies rendering the agriculture sector more
resilient to climate variability and volatility of commodity prices.

Further strengthening the stability of the financial sector and deepening its reach to small
and medium sized enterprises and the poorer segments of the population;

is being explored and on- and offshore oil prospects are under examination.

17.
Important gains in reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity have been
consolidated since 2010. After several years of sustained decline, by 2010 moderate and
extreme poverty rates had declined to 18.7 and 1.2 percent, respectively . In 2012, these rates fell
further to 13.1 percent and 0.6 percent (see figure 1). Increases in labor income of the poor were
the main factor behind the fall in poverty, together with the expansion of social programs, in
particular the introduction of new family allowances programs. As shown in Figure 2, since the
end of the crisis in 2003, income growth of Uruguay's bottom 40 percent income earners has
generally been higher than mean income growth, and generally higher than the income growth of
Latin America's bottom 40 percent. This important improvement in shared prosperity reflects the
high income growth rates in general and a significant fall in inequality since 2007, measured by
the Gini Coefficient, reaching 40.1 in 2011, from 42.1 in 2010.
18.
Protecting vulnerable groups from economic shocks remains a key challenge.
Estimates of income mobility suggest that most households that exited poverty in recent years
have experienced only a modest welfare improvement and face high risks of falling back into
poverty. The same applies for those that have escaped extreme poverty. Identifying this segment
of the population and adequately protecting it against potential negative shocks is a key priority
for the Government.

III. PROGRESS TOWARDS CPS OUTCOMES
A.

Results to Date

19.
Overall progress toward CPS outcomes as defined in the results matrix has been
satisfactory. Significant results have already been achieved under all CPS pillars, in particular
on reducing macroeconomic vulnerability, public sector modernization, strengthened business
climate, improving water and sanitation services and increasing inclusion and equity. Progress
in improving quality and coverage of transport infrastructure and implementing a noncommunicable disease (NCD) prevention strategy has been slowed by implementation
challenges and budgetary constraints, though achievement of core outcomes remains on track. A
detailed description on progress towards CPS outcome indicators is presented in the revised
Results Matrix (Annex 1). A summary of key results follows.
20.
Prudent macroeconomic and fiscal policies have reduced the economy's
vulnerability to external shocks. The Bank provided US$ 520 million 7 in contingent financing
as support to the Government's precautionary financing strategy. Together with contingent
financing from other multilateral partners, this provided a robust fiscal buffer for Uruguay to
prevent a reversal of poverty reduction and shared prosperity gains achieved in recent years. This
financing also played a role in Uruguay's credit risk upgrading to Investment Grade in early
2012.
21.
The use of innovative Bank support instruments has contributed to an effective
fiscal risk management. Uruguay has taken advantage of IBRD's local currency financing
capabilities to support the Government's objective of reducing currency risk in their sovereign
debt portfolio and recently converted IBRD loans for a total of US$150 million into Uruguayan
pesos through the first local currency financing via the swap market. In addition, the Bank is
preparing a weather derivative transaction with Uruguay's power utility (UTE) aimed at hedging
its exposure to low rainfall and high oil prices, both of which affect the cost of power generation.
Finally, technical assistance through the Global Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond
Program (GEMLOC) initiative helped further strengthen Uruguay's issuance and debt market
development strategy with a focus on local currency issuance. These efforts have contributed to
improving the country's debt profile, further decreasing foreign exchange risks and deepening
the financial sector.
22.
Several measures to enhance public sector performance have been implemented.
DPL support contributed to the introduction of performance-oriented budgeting. The 2010-2014
Budget Law8 is the first in Uruguay to organize the budget in programmatic areas and to link
program resources to specific output and outcome indicators, allowing for a better assessment of
the impact of fiscal policies. The Institution Building Technical Assistance Loan (IBTAL)
supported this objective by strengthening capacity in eight ministries through the creation of
planning, evaluation and quality control units. The IBTAL also supported ongoing e-government

Programmatic Public Sector, Competitiveness and Social Inclusion DPL I & II (P116215 and P123242), and
Public Sector Management and Social Inclusion DPL (P131440).
Law No. 18.834 dated October 25, 2011

and procurement reforms aimed at enhancing Government efficiency and transparency. As of
today, 25 Government processes can now be initiated and completed electronically, and a procurement
regulatory agency (Agencia de Comprasy Contrataciones)was created in 2012.
23.
Reforms supported by the Bank Group have helped improve the country's business
environment. Bank support toward this objective was provided mostly through the DPLs, but
also through South-South exchanges on reforms such as facilitating business registration.
Uruguay's Doing Business ranking has improved from 114 in 2010 to 89 in 2013. Key reforms
in this regard were the substantial reduction from 65 (2010) to 7 (2013) days required to start a
private company, and the transformation of the customs control system from physical inspections
and ex-ante reviews into a more effective and less time-consuming risk-based management
system. Progress was also achieved towards promoting financial market development and
enhancing investor confidence through the implementation of the Capital Markets Law 9, which
regulates the minimum requirements for stock offerings, and the computerization of the Stock
Exchange Register. In addition, IFC trade finance investment with the Nuevo Banco Comercial
(NBC) is currently supporting more than 3,000 MSMEs in the country's export sector.
24.
Progress has been made on upgrading infrastructure, yet not across the board. The
Bank contributed to increased efficiency, accountability and sustainability of the country's main
water services provider, Obras Sanitarias del Estado (OSE) 10 . Results include the
implementation of new operational models and improved customer service practices and
environmental management, together with the expansion of clean water networks and the
connection of 8,500 families to the sewage network. These reforms resulted in a significant
increase in customer satisfaction and a reduction in water losses, which had been increasing prior
to Bank intervention. In addition, a GEF-financed operation" supported the introduction of
energy efficiency as a national priority and leveraged investment projects for more than US$ 20
million that resulted in significant energy savings.
25.
While Bank support has contributed to sustain the condition of the national roads
network, reforms to upgrade broader transport infrastructure have advanced more slowly
than initially envisioned. Road infrastructure upgrading continues to pose challenges due to
increased freight traffic and budgetary constraints. Railway system reform and the introduction
of PPPs in the roads sector have progressed slower than expected. This being said, the approval
of a regulatory framework for PPPs, the creation of the National Logistics Institute, and capacity
building efforts in this area provide a sound basis to advance on these reforms going forward. In
addition, the recently approved IFC investment operation with Hidrovia do Brasil (HDB), a
US$74 million IFC loan plus US$30 million in mobilization, is expected to increase the supply
of efficient, low emission transport services on the river system.
26.
Improvements in natural resource management and climate change adaptation are
an important achievement of the CPS period. The CPS has made a considerable contribution
to the improvement of Uruguay's natural resources management (NRM,), through a series of
' Law No. 18.627 dated November 24, 2009
10OSE Modernization and System Rehabilitation Project (P101432).

activities clustered around the Integrated Natural Resource Management and Biodiversity Project
(P070653), by supporting on-farm investments throughout the country and promoting
technologies that reduce the vulnerability of small producers to the increasing climate variability
experienced in recent years in Uruguay. This includes strengthening information systems on
production, climate and NRM and at the producer and policy level. As part of a Bank-supported
program, more than 9,000 farm-level projects have been implemented leading to improved
natural resource, water and biodiversity management, covering an area of more 800,000 hectares
and providing direct and indirect support to 6,000 mostly small and medium farmers.
27.
Through investments and advisory services, IFC has also contributed to climate
change mitigation. Its financing of resource efficiency developments to reduce water and
energy consumption by Conaprole, Uruguay's leading dairy processor, and support to
developing fuel-efficient and low emission transport modes along the Uruguay River has led to
strengthened environmental and social standards in the private sector.
28.
Social protection programs have been expanded and consolidated. DPL, IBTAL and
analytical support to social protection reformsl 2 focused on consolidating the National Equity
Plan (NEP), which seeks to expand coverage of non-contributory social protection policies to the
poor and vulnerable, and improve their targeting. Since 2010 NEP coverage increased from 80
percent to 83 percent of households in the poorest quintile, contributing to the sustained decline
in poverty. Important progress was made on improving targeting of social programs with Bank
support. A Social Areas Integrated Information System (SIIAS) was created, a detailed register
of beneficiaries of different social programs, and a comprehensive door-to-door review of actual
and potential recipients of social transfers was conducted. These improvements are particularly
important for poor women, who are over-proportionally suffering from current targeting errors,
according to the results of a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) conducted for the 2012
DPL. Finally, the Bank provided an important analytical input on how the fiscal sustainability of
the expansion of these programs can be maintained over time through the recently completed
Public Expenditure Review (PER).
29.
Advances on health reform implementation have led to increased public health
insurance coverage and improved NCD prevention. DPL- and AAA-supported reforms in
health included the expansion of national health insurance coverage. Coverage is expected to
reach 60 percent of the population by the end of the CPS period, up from 43 percent in 2010. The
Non-Communicable Disease Prevention Project (P050716) has suffered implementation delays
due to the time-intensive effort needed to put implementation arrangements in place.
Notwithstanding, activities completed so far have contributed to increasing the share of the
population covered and screened for NCD risk factors, and a drop in mortality rates from
circulatory system diseases. The focus on reproductive health issues and risk factors specific to
women has led to these results being particularly relevant to women.

Despite widespread concerns about a reform impasse in the education sector, there
have been advances on education coverage and quality in key areas. The current Government
considers education as the "priority of priorities". However, efforts to reverse declining trends on
education outcomes, in particular at the secondary level, have not led to the desired results. Bank
support in the sector has focused on expanding and improving the country's full-time school
(FTS) program for primary education by financing the construction and rehabilitation of more
than 170 FTSs and delivering capacity-building programs to FTS teachersl 3 . In addition, DPL
and AAA support contributed to the consolidation of the Government's One Laptop per Child
Program (Plan Ceibal), which now covers 100 percent of primary school students. Expanding
such positive examples of strengthening specific education policies to more broad-based
improvements in the sector represents a key challenge going forward.
B.

Program Implementation and Portfolio Performance

31.
A key element of CPS implementation has been an increased emphasis on
innovation and results. Responding to the Government's request, the Bank has channeled
financial and knowledge resources to innovative interventions with strong expected development
impact, providing best practice technical know-how in key sectors and contributing to capacity
building in reform program design and implementation. A significant share of new lendinf was
provided through innovative instruments such as contingent financing through DPL/DDOs and
the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program for Results (PforR) (P125803), the first
project in the region delivered under this new modality. The PfoR disburses against
achievements in specified indicators, enabling a focus on capacity building and strengthening of
country fiduciary and environmental systems.
32.
New Bank lending commitments since the start of the CPS period total US$ 827
million, surpassing significantly the originally indicated amount of US$ 700 million. Of the
new lending amount, US$ 620 million were delivered in the form of DPLs, US$ 141 million in
investment operations and US$ 66 million in a PforR project. In addition, trust funds and AAA
programs have been used selectively to support key institutional reforms and project design and
implementation, such as: i) TF financing by the Spanish Fund for Latin America and the
Caribbean (SFLAC) to support capacity-building on PPPs, development of a low-carbon growth
strategy and preparation of the recently approved OSE Sustainable and Efficient Project
(P118064); ii) a Public Expenditure Review aimed at identifying challenges and opportunities in
fiscal spending and education and health reforms; and iii) GEF-financed operations supporting
biodiversity and energy efficiency.
33.
IFC has approved 5 new investment projects since August 2010. Three of them relate
to trade finance, one to agribusiness (Conaprole), and one in tourist services (Pestana Uruguay),
in addition to the HDB barge transport project expected to be approved shortly. If the HDB

project is included ($74 million IFC loan plus $30 million mobilization), IFC new financing
during the CPS period will amount to a total of $158 million.
34.
Development policy lending under the current CPS increased to US$ 620 million
from the US$ 200 million initially envisaged. This was a response to the Government's request
for significant levels of contingent financing from the Bank to support its precautionary
financing strategy in the context of increasing global economic uncertainties. The Government's
strategy aims at mitigating risks resulting from deteriorating conditions in international debt
markets, which in small economy like Uruguay can have serious consequences. The increase in
the amount for DPL-DDOs was made possible by an increased level of the total CPS lending
envelope. This increase has enabled investment lending to continue as described in the CPS. The
authorities stated that they would only request disbursement under the DPL-DDO if international
financial conditions were to deteriorate significantly. The modification is in line with the
agreement between the Government and the Bank reflected in the CPS to keep the strategy
flexible and adjust the program in the event of unforeseen domestic or external developments.
35.
Portfolio performance remains strong as a result of a robust Bank-Government
partnership, ongoing implementation support and bi-annual Country Portfolio
Performance Reviews (CPPRs). The disbursement ratio has averaged 41.8 percent during the
CPS period and reached 59.9 percent in FY12, the highest in the region during that year. There is
one problem project in the portfolio, representing 9.3 percent of the investment portfolio by
amount, which currently totals US$ 270.4 million. This project was recently restructured to
address implementation challenges and is expected to return to satisfactory levels shortly.
36.
Implementation of the Strategy has yielded important lessons that will inform the
Bank's engagement in the future. Four lessons stand out in this regard:
* First, the Government and the Bank agreed on the importance of establishing clear
baselines during project design to enable rigorous impact evaluation, a lesson which was
incorporated in recently-approved investment operations in education and water and
sanitation 6 . Similarly, the Bank could provide technical support to strengthening M&E
of Government programs, as recently agreed in the context of the planned impact
evaluation of a new early childhood program.
* Second, there is consensus that the Bank-supported program in Uruguay should gradually
move to using existing Government structures to manage projects (as opposed to the
usual practice of creating separate project units). This said, experience has shown that
adapting Bank programs and procedures to existing structures requires more intense
monitoring and support.
* Third, a more systematic approach to prioritizing, reviewing and adjusting Bank's
supported analytical and advisory activities (AAA) could help ensure that these activities
respond to priority demands from the country, strengthen linkages among different tasks,
and better disseminate findings. Such an approach was initially envisaged in the CPS,
which proposed to institute a formal AAA collaboration agreement.

C.

Fourth, the flexibility in the lending program agreed upon in the CPS proved effective as
it enabled the Government and the Bank to respond effectively to the increased level of
uncertainty that the Uruguayan economy has been facing, through an increase in fast
disbursing contingent financing.
Adjustments to CPS Results Framework

37.
Most elements of the 2010-2015 CPS results framework remain relevant, and the
achievement of most intended results is on track. Several indicators were adjusted in light of
changes in priorities and of implementation experience. Indicators were included or modified to
reflect changes in the Bank Group's engagement in the country and incorporate expected results
from recently approved operations, most notably the following: i) contribute to sustaining the
condition of the national road network and strengthen road sector management and road safety
through PforR financing; ii) strengthen water and sanitation sector efficiency by further reducing
water losses and increasing the sector's energy efficiency and sustainability, and iii) reduce
learning gaps by strengthening FTS education quality.
38.
Lending operations in energy transmission strengthening and sustainable industrial
development (SID) did not materialize as the authorities and the Bank concluded that they
would produce limited added value. Instead, the Bank supported the implementation of a GEF
grant on energy efficiency and financial support for the Government's SID agenda is being
replaced by IDF-financed technical assistance. Outcome indicators on energy were adjusted
accordingly, and SID-related indicators were dropped as results are not expected to materialize
until the next CPS period.
39.
Several outcomes and milestones were adjusted to better reflect changed realities in
the country and the strengthened focus on areas where the Bank Group program could
influence results. Indicators on fiscal deficit reduction, credit-to-GDP ratio growth and
increased capital market activity were dropped as expected outcomes were not directly
influenced by the Bank Group's program. Moreover, the outcome on sustainable industrial
development was dropped together with the expected lending operation, given that results from
triple AAA and TF support to sustainable industrial development will materialize only in the
next CPS period. In addition, indicators related to the implementation of a NCD prevention
strategy were adjusted following a recent NCD Prevention Project (P050716) restructuring to
accelerate its execution and ensure timely delivery of results. Lastly, education outcomes were
modified to more accurately reflect the Bank program's large focus on FTS.

IV. FUTURE ENGAGEMENT
40.
Implementation of the CPS program has advanced as planned. Most new lending
proposed in the CPS has been delivered in the first half of the CPS period (see Table 2).
Similarly, an ambitious AAA program on knowledge generation and sharing has been put into
practice, with several studies and TA activities providing substantial support to the formulation
and implementation of critical reforms in areas such as on social protection, debt management,
health, PPP and climate change. Selection of new knowledge, TA and convening services
supported by the Bank, and review of progress of these activities has been conducted through a
11

6-monthly joint review of the AAA program. As mentioned above, going forward, AAA
collaboration could benefit from being further systematized in the form of a framework
agreement on a joint analytical and technical assistance program.
41.
The remainder of the CPS period offers the opportunity to consolidate program
results and prepare for the coming CPS cycle. The authorities and the Bank have agreed to
shift emphasis in the Bank's collaboration with Uruguay as follows: first, to strengthen
implementation of the current portfolio, in particular by strengthening M&E frameworks; and
second, to prepare for the coming Government (and CPS) cycle by deepening diagnostic work on
medium- and long-term development challenges, identifying reform options and helping create
broad consensus around them. A first step in this direction was conducted in the form of a virtual
consultation in the context of the preparation of the CPSPR (see Box 1). This would culminate in
the Policy Notes process starting at end-FY14. The diagnostic work and related policy dialog
will have the additional objective of identifying possible areas for new Bank lending or
knowledge programs at the end of the current or beginning of the forthcoming cycle.

Box 1. A New Way of Conducting CPSPR Consultations through Social Media
The Bank has put an increasing emphasis on engaging with Uruguayan partners from Government,
academia, private sector, think tanks and civil society on key development issues, and on providing a
platform for dialogue. In line with this, a virtual consultation was conducted for the preparation of this
CPS Progress Report, with the objective of gathering views from a broad array of stakeholders. This
was done in addition of several instances of dialog with the authorities.
Through this virtual consultation feedback was sought from a broad audience on: (i) the main
development challenges currently faced by Uruguay; (ii) ideas on possible solutions and best practices
on those areas; and (iii) the role the World Bank could play in the process. The invitation to this
consultation was disseminated through traditional and social media. A blog and a Collaboration 4
Development Platform were used for the consultation.
The feedback received was thoughtful and valuable. Participants shared ideas on how the government
could improve its results and how the Bank Group could add best value. Education, entrepreneurship,
and public sector reform were the most popular topics related to what should be Government
priorities. Logistics, infrastructure, social policies, health, economic management and security were
also mentioned in this regard. A more detailed account of these consultations is reflected in Annex 3.
In relation to the role the Bank Group should play to support Uruguay's development, several
interesting ideas were put forward. Some commentators advocated for continuation or upgrading of
existing areas of Bank Group support: :
* Promoting the use all available modes of transport to develop an efficient logistics network and to
strengthen Uruguay's potential as a regional hub.
* Putting special emphasis on supporting education, Uruguay's main challenge.
* Conducting pilot projects on public sector reforms, applying good governance standards,
promoting greater efficiency, and enhancing administrative decentralization.
* Continuing to support full-time schools as they are seen as effective in deepening social inclusion
through education and training.
Others suggested new areas of priority for the country, to which the Bank Group could add value:
* Strengthening tertiary education in the interior of the country.
* Fostering entrepreneurship and reducing informality by implementing a program - jointly with
the Government- to subsidize for a period of time the contributions of MSMEs to job creation.
* Helping establish community centers where people could meet for cultural activities, sports, and
develop a sense of belonging.
* Training of youth (young mothers in particular) on values, and on specific tasks that would allow
them to upgrade their self-esteem and financially support their families.
Still others saw an enhanced role for the Bank beyond traditional supported centered on lending:
* Going beyond financial support to Uruguay by providing technical assistance and promoting
opportunities for discussion and research.
* Acting as a knowledge platform by inviting international experts that could share other countries'
experiences in specific areas, such as on program evaluation or vocational training.
These inputs inform and confirm the intention of focusing efforts in the remainder of the CPS on
consolidating and enhancing results in existing areas of collaboration and on generating and sharing
knowledge through the Program. While some new areas of engagement will be considered for this
period, the suggestions received in this regard will be particularly useful for the renewal of the
Dro2ram in the forthcominE CPS Deriod.

42.
The AAA program for the remainder of the CPS period will focus on completing
ongoing activities and increasingly integrating activities into programs with clearly defined
objectives. While a more detailed definition of the AAA program will be discussed and agreed
13

with the Government in the coming months, the program is taking shape. It will include the
completion of ongoing AAA (see Annex 3), and the continuation of programmatic analytical
approaches, such as: i) the demand-based analytical collaboration with the MEF on
macroeconomic management, ii) follow-up technical support to the PPP reform, or iii) different
activities around the green growth agenda. The authorities and the Bank share the ambition of
integrating these analytical activities in programs with clearly defined objectives.
43.
There has been agreement in principle to embark on a limited number of new
analytical tasks in the remainder of the CPS period. These tasks aim at identifying next
generation social and economic policies with scope to further enhance shared prosperity and
reduce poverty, and lead the country on a green and inclusive growth path that is more resilient
against different types of shocks. A priori,new analytical tasks would focus on the following:
* Strengthening public sector capacity in managing a modernized railway system.
* Seeking better understanding of how to enhance productivity in key productive sectors in
view of strengthening competiveness of the economy as a whole.
* Developing measures to enhance financial sector deepening, such as mobile factoring.
* Supporting impact evaluations in priority public programs, with a focus on how these
improve living conditions of vulnerable groups and further reduce gender gaps.
* Identifying priorities for strengthening legal, regulatory and administrative capacity on
managing extractive industries.
44.
The key elements of IFC's strategy for private sector development in Uruguay will
continue to be based on its four focus areas in Uruguay. These are: i) financial services, ii)
agribusiness, iii) competiveness; and iv) education. Through Conaprole, IFC expects to support
111 new jobs, reach 200 farmers, and make $81.3 million in purchases from domestic suppliers.
Through Pestana Uruguay, IFC expects to support 100 new jobs, of which 60 are for women,
make $2.2 million in new purchases from domestic suppliers, and generate US$ 600,000 in
additional Government revenues. New investments in growth sectors and infrastructure are
expected to result in significant improvements in competitiveness and logistics costs. Together
with the Bank, IFC intends to support the implementation of the PPP legal and regulatory
framework through advisory and investment services. Potential areas for engagement on this are
transport (ports, rail, logistics), solid waste management and energy (renewable sources, and
natural gas). Bank and IFC will also coordinate their approach to support PPPs at the subnational
level (Montevideo Municipality, OSE, and others).

V. PROGRAM RISKS AND MITIGATION
45.
Risks to the program as identified in the CPS remain low, and efforts to manage
risks more proactively have intensified. A potential increase in intensity and volatility in
global economic uncertainties and the forthcoming political transition are the main risk factors to
reckon with in the remainder of CPS implementation. At the same time, the authorities have
taken on a pro-active stance on managing different risks and volatility, with Bank Group support,
and have intensified efforts to build resilience against economic and climate shocks.

14

46.
The external economic environment has become more volatile and unstable. Since
approval of the CPS, the increasing Eurozone instability has raised the probability of a reversal
of the favorable external economic environment of Uruguay. Changes in other global parameters,
such as an increased volatility in agricultural commodity prices could have significant effects on
the Uruguayan economy. In addition, certain developments in Argentina and Brazil have
increased concerns about potential regional trade shocks. Slower growth in Uruguay's
neighboring countries, and trade restrictions imposed by Argentina, have resulted in a
deceleration of export growth to Brazil from 12.6 percent in 2011 to 5.9 percent in 2012, and a
14.6 percent contraction of exports to Argentina, compared to an increase of 17 percent in 2011.
47.
Yet Uruguay also managed to further reduce its vulnerability to shocks, and a
marked reversal of its currently favorable economic trajectory is considered unlikely over
the remainder of the CPS period. There have been significant further improvements on
reducing the country's vulnerability to external economic shocks. The country has diversified its
export profile and China has replaced Argentina as the second largest trading partner after Brazil.
The debt profile has improved markedly, as reported above. Uruguay's return to Investment
Grade status in early 2012 is both recognition of this improvement and a stabilizing factor itself.
The swift response to the Government's request for increased DPL financing in DDO format and
the conversion of US$ 150 million of IBRD debt into local currency were important
contributions to the Government's efforts to create a sizeable fiscal cushion against a potential
deterioration of access to markets and effective debt management.
48.
Greater financial system stability also contributed to reducing vulnerability against
external shocks. This is a result of the banking system consolidation process that occurred in the
aftermath of the 2002 crisis and proactive Central Bank intervention and supervision. The
financial system has managed to navigate the global financial crisis and its aftermath without
major difficulties. Prudential requirements have been improved and banking regulation and
supervision have been strengthened. The accumulation of foreign reserves by the central bank
contributed further to the confidence in Uruguay's currency, which has been floating since 2002.
49.
Political and Social Risks remain low, yet the forthcoming political transition period
could have an impact on program implementation. There is risk of increased pressure to
expand public programs, in particular in social areas and on infrastructure upgrading with the
end of the administration's mandate approaching. Together with the deterioration in fiscal results
in 2012, this has raised some concerns on the prospects for maintaining a prudent fiscal stance.
However this risk is mitigated by the solid track record of the administration on fiscal stability,
and the legal limits to spending increases in the last year of the Government's term. In general,
political debates are likely to become more polarized as elections near, and this might lead the
Government to slow down the pace on more disputed reforms, such as on restructuring the
railway sector and the modernization of the state. However this is unlikely to significantly affect
implementation of reforms supported by the Bank Group's program, due to the majority of the
FrenteAmplio Government in Parliament and the consensus orientation of Uruguayan society.
50.
Since 2010, the trend of increasing climate variability has continued, with significant
implications for livelihoods, production and fiscal results. Variability in rainfall levels has
been increasing since 1996, giving rise to a number of severe droughts which have had a major
15

impact on rural income and the fiscal balance, the latter through higher energy imports needs. At
the same time, awareness of climate-related risks has increased and so have efforts to strengthen
resilience. The new Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Climate Change Project
(P12418 1) will enhance small and medium sized producers' resilience to climate variability. This
stands at the center of several other activities aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate risks,
including through innovative measures like climate insurance.

Annex 3: Summary of virtual CPS Progress Report consultation
A virtual consultation was conducted for the preparation of this CPS Progress Report, with the
objective of gathering views from a broad array of stakeholders. Through this novel approach,
feedback was sought from a broad audience, through social media. The themes put forward for
discussion were: (i) the main development challenges currently faced by Uruguay; (ii) ideas on
possible solutions and best practices on those areas; and (iii) the role the Bank Group could play
in the process. The invitation to this consultation was disseminated through traditional and social
media. A blog and a Collaboration 4 Development Platform were used for the consultation.
The feedback received was thoughtful and valuable. Participants shared what they considered
best practices from other countries, or ideas on how the government could improve its results.
Education, entrepreneurship, and public sector reform were the most popular topics related to
what should be Government priorities. Logistics, infrastructure, social policies, health, economic
management and security were also mentioned in this regard.
The virtual consultation brought forward specific comments on reforms in key development
areas. These are summarized in the following, by area:
Public sector reform: comments focused on the necessity of reducing the size of the state,
improving quality and impact of public spending, the need of strengthening transparency, and the
importance of training public servants to improve their performance.
Logistics: increased investments are needed to improve transport efficiency through
rehabilitation and maintenance on the railway system and the road system. These improvements
would strengthen Uruguay's competitiveness through increased coverage of infrastructure and
establishment of a more conducive business environment.
Social policies: suggestions included consolidation of social protection transfer programs, as
well as better articulation with local governments to assure an equal implementation throughout
the country. Participants suggested that social benefits should be better linked to specific
conditions.
Economy: enhance solid economic policies that lead to macroeconomic stability and help reduce
external vulnerabilities. Moreover, stronger efforts are needed to diversify markets and products,
and accelerate productivity growth. Also, the tax burden in Uruguay was pointed as heavy, both
for its size and its complexity.
Education: this topic received most comments. Participants agreed that this was the main
development challenge that Uruguay is currently facing. Suggestions to improve education
policies included:
*
*

Quality control for teachers at entry and adequate salaries to retain the best
professionals.
Social benefits to vulnerable families linked to specific conditions such as mandatory
school and high school attendance of their children.

26

*

*
*
*
*

Specific school systems that could allow every Uruguayan to access to a decent job.
The system should focus on vulnerable groups in order to reduce the existing gap
between them and the rest.
Create incentives to simulate knowledge generation on science and technology, both
in the public and private sectors
Better quality of public education, by applying modem education programs and
techniques (adapting to the changes occurring in the world).
Create awareness on the importance of technical studies, and promote technical
education, especially in the interior of the country.
Stimulate work habits among youth (especially those that are neither studying nor
working) to prevent dependency or delinquency.

Health: feedback on this area centered on the need of faster reforms, more actions on health
prevention, and better infrastructure for quality health services. Comments referred to an
overwhelmed public health system that responded too slow to patient's needs, and limitations of
capable health professionals.
Entrepreneurship: several participants agreed on the need for Uruguay to stimulate
entrepreneurship. Specific ideas on this included:
*
*

Develop an entrepreneurial culture, starting at education and youth, through
awareness building, training, direct support to start-ups, etc.
Reduce and simplify administrative requirements, as there were too many initial costs
and taxes to start a business. This tended to stop people, especially young and
innovative people- from trying to create a business. It was also felt that this was a
factor leading to informality. It was suggested to address this by encouraging the
creation of companies with cooperative status, simplifying registration formalities, or
abolishing or reducing minimum capital requirement. A broader roll-out of Egovernment was seen as important for this, too.

Innovation: create a culture that stimulates new ideas and creativity in general._This could entail
dedicating resources for students and researchers to improve development of R & D, establishing
a R&D startup pole jointly with the Uruguayan Agency for Innovation and Research (ANII), or
creating Uruguayan brand on innovation (such as http://startupchile.org/).
Security: this topic was mentioned as a key development challenge. Several suggestions were
made to strengthen both prevention of crime and enforcement of the rule of law.
