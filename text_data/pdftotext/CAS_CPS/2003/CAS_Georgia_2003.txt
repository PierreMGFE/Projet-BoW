EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
Economic, Poverty and Governance Trends. Georgia is a small transition economy
with a population o f about five m i l l i o n people and a per capita GDP o f US$700. In Soviet times,
Georgia exported agricultural and energy-intensive industrial products, and enjoyed a fairly high
standard o f living compared with neighboring republics. After independence in 1991, however,
the economy collapsed under the impact o f c i v i l war and the loss o f both preferential access t o
FSU markets and large budget transfers from Moscow. In the last five years, the Russia crisis,
droughts and an earthquake have further buffeted Georgia. In amongst these shocks there have
been brief periods o f strong GDP growth, leading to a cumulative economic expansion o f 45
percent since 1995, as the private sector has taken some advantage o f economic liberalization.
Nonetheless, GDP i s s t i l l only about one-third o f its 1990 level, despite the strong export
potential residing in Georgia’s competitive labor force, good natural resource base and
geographic position as a major transit route. Unemployment remains high and much economic
activity resides in a large and growing informal sector. In the circumstances, poverty,
vulnerability and inequality have all increased over the period. While some indicators o f the
business environment have improved in recent years, governance is today acknowledged by the
authorities, donors and stakeholders to pose important constraints o n Georgia’s prospects o f
attracting adequate private sector investment to support sustainable growth and implementation
o f i t s recently completed PRSP.
1.

..

Over the past decade, Georgia has made quite good progress o n policy reform, including
trade liberalization, legal and regulatory reform, privatization and competition, banking sector
restructuring, and judicial and health sector reforms. However, these successes have often been
diluted by weak implementation, in turn due partly t o weak fiscal management and public sector
capacity. Budget management in particular needs to be strengthened to improve the link
between overall resource allocation and sector objectives, programs and policies. Progress in
implementing Georgia’s PRSP will also require improvements in the very l o w revenue collection
rate that currently compromises the Government’s ability t o implement priority programs, as
w e l l as management o f the country’s fairly large external debt situation. Tackling these and
related governance challenges will be difficult given Georgia’s current political cycle. There i s
significant political fragmentation, and electoral politics are likely t o dominate the agenda, as
President Shevardnadze’s second and final term ends in April 2005.
11.

iii.

FY04-06 CAS Program. Georgia has recently completed its PRSP, known as the
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP). The EDPRP focuses o n five
strategic pillars: governance, fiscal management, the business environment, human capital, and

reducing the vulnerability o f the poor. I t also includes specific measures t o improve major
productive sectors o f the economy, the natural environment, post-conflict zones, and science and
technology. The EDPRP serves as the organizing framework for the FY04-06 CAS, which will
focus o n (i)attaining faster and more broad-based growth, (ii)
developing and strengthening
human capital and strengthening public sector management, and (iii)
improving governance and
institutional capacity .

iv.
M u c h o f the work in these areas will take place through IDA’S and IFC’s large and,
despite the difficult environment, s t i l l fairly sound ongoing portfolios in Georgia, complemented

by Base Case lending o f up to $78 million, and by AAA and non-lending activities, including
IFC’s advisory and linkages programs, designed t o help build the foundation for institutional and
policy renewal. This level o f lending i s significantly lower than in FYO1-03 ($168 million) and
FY98-00 ($295 million). Given the aforementioned political cycle, it may be difficult for
Georgia to achieve a High Case scenario until the latter part o f this CAS period. Such a scenario
would require significant improvements in governance, and would include an acceleration o f
planned support for improving public sector management and a first PRSC, or a programmatic
adjustment credit, for total IDA lending o f up to $100 million. The Base Case would be
conditioned mainly on monitorable progress in governance, satisfactory macroeconomic
performance, progress in initiating implementation o f the EDPRP, and continued good portfolio
implementation. A L o w Case o f $45 m i l l i o n i s envisaged if governance reform, macroeconomic
management or the IDA portfolio deteriorates.
v.
Risks. The strategy outlined above faces five kinds o f risks. First, if the governance
climate does not improve, it will be difficult t o carry out the EDPRP effectively. IDA’Spolicy
dialogue, lending and nonlending activities are focusing o n this as a top priority. A second risk
i s that o f a renewed weakening o f fiscal performance, with a consequent inability t o maintain
basic social services and manage external debt obligations. The IMF i s providing intensive
advice to Georgia o n fiscal policy, and IDA and other partners have offered, or are providing,
assistance o n budget management and reform o f tax and customs administration. Progress in this
area i s required t o allow Georgia t o return to the Paris Club for discussions o n further debt
rescheduling. Third, Georgia remains vulnerable to both internal and external conflicts.
Enhanced regional cooperation will be important t o increase central government revenues, and
for Georgia t o maximize i t s potential as a transit economy and strengthen foreign investment,
tourism and trade. Fourth, Georgia is, and will remain, vulnerable t o external shocks. C A S
interventions promoting energy development, irrigation and rural development, and diversification o f Georgia’s trade patterns should help lessen the country’s vulnerability t o these shocks
over the medium-term. Finally, the period up t o the April 2005 Presidential elections i s likely to
be one o f considerable political uncertainty, with the direction o f policy before and after the
elections being difficult to predict. IDA will engage in a broad dialogue with all stakeholders
during this period, and will support the EDPRP consultation process in an effort to build
consensus o n the country’s main development challenges and opportunities. A C A S Progress
Report will be presented to the Board after the Presidential elections if there has been sufficient
change that circumstances warrant a review o f the assistance strategy.

Issues for Discussion. The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:

I s the assistance strategy sufficiently selective and appropriate given the difficult
governance climate?
I s it warranted to restrict PRSC or programmatic adjustment lending t o the High Case?

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR GEORGIA

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This joint IDA and IFC Country Assistance Strategy covers the three-year period from
FY04 to FY06. It identifies key issues in Georgia’s economic and social development, reviews
performance under the previous CAS, and discusses a selective program o f lending and nonlending operations under different scenarios o f risk and performance. The FY98-00 Georgia
CAS (Report 17000-GE) was discussed by the Executive Directors in October 1997. A
subsequent CAS was drafted in FYOl but was delayed as Georgia began work on i t s Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP); a revised version was prepared in FY02 but was also delayed
over concerns that broad changes in composition o f the Cabinet might signal shifts in policy
directions, which ultimately did not materialize. The current CAS takes into account Georgia’s
now completed PRSP, known as the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(EDPRP). It has benefited from continuing close dialogue with government authorities, other
national stakeholders and international development partners, both on the priorities for Bank
Group assistance and on the EDPRP.

11. THECOUNTRYCONTEXT
Economic and Political Background

2.
Georgia i s a small transition economy with a population o f about five million people and
a per capita GDP o f US$700. In Soviet times, Georgia exported agricultural and energyintensive industrial products to the former Soviet Union, and was a popular tourist destination for
the region. After independence in 1991, the economy collapsed under the impact o f civil war
and the loss o f both preferential access to FSU markets and large budget transfers from Moscow.
Output f e l l by 70 percent and exports by 90 percent, the worst decline suffered by any transition
economy.
3.
Immediately after independence in April 1991, a civil war broke out in Georgia, followed
by regional conflicts. By late-1993, cease-fire agreements were reached with Abkhazia
(brokered by the United Nations and Russia) and South Ossetia. The conflicts l e f t a significant
toll, with about 300,000 people displaced, much physical capital destroyed, important trade
routes disrupted, and the new State’s authority undermined to this day in large segments o f the
territory. To varying degrees the Government s t i l l lacks control both in Abkhazia and South
Ossetia, and in Adjara (an autonomous region in western Georgia). In addition, the spill-over
f i o m the conflict in Chechnya has weakened Georgia’s control o f the Pankisi Gorge and
surrounding territory, where rampant smuggling, extortion and kidnapping have taken place.

4.
By m i d - 1 9 9 0 ’ ~Georgia
~
had begun to recover from the collapse o f its economy after
independence and the civil war. Reform efforts acquired momentum and growth began to
accelerate. Since then, however, progress has been affected by the Russian crisis, droughts, an

earthquake and internal political fragmentation. Nonetheless, amongst these shocks there have
been brief periods o f strong growth, leading to a cumulative expansion o f the economy by 45
percent since 1995, as the private sector has taken some advantage o f economic liberalization.
Competition in telecommunications, for example, has led t o very favorable call charges. Public
sector initiatives have also shown results where they have been adequately financed, and
performance o f the IDA portfolio has been generally good despite a difficult operating environment. However, agriculture and industry, traditionally Georgia’s major sources o f exports and
employment, have made only modest recovery from their post independence collapse. And
while several indicators o f the business environment have improved in recent years, govemance
is generally considered t o be a major constraint o n Georgia’s prospects for attracting foreign
investment, achieving higher sustainable growth rates, and successfully implementing i t s
EDPW.

5.

Political fragmentation threatens t o undermine Georgia’s already fragile economic situation and reform efforts. Inability to provide the expected level o f economic and social services
has weakened support for the Government both in Parliament (where the number o f political
parties i s growing) and from society. Significant political uncertainty remains likely for the next
18 months. Parliamentary elections took place o n November 2, 2003, and President
Shevardnadze’s second -- and, by constitutional mandate, final -- t e r m ends in April 2005.

Macroeconomic Performance and G r ow t . Prospects

Growth Trends to Date. In 1994, following the post-independence economic collapse
and hyperinflation, the Government launched stabilization and structural reforms aimed at
6.

restoring economic growth. The economic response t o these reforms o f the mid-1990s was
dramatic at first, with real GDP growth rebounding to an average o f 10.6 percent a year in 199697. Adverse exogenous shocks (the Russia crisis and severe droughts in 1998-2000) caused
growth t o slow during 1998-2000, although it has rebounded t o an average o f 5 percent during
2001-02. The annual rate o f inflation was brought down t o single digits by 1997, and has since
remained at around 5 percent, except for a brief upswing in late 1998 and early 1999 when the
Russian financial crisis triggered a substantial depreciation o f the Georgian Lari. The exchange
rate regime i s fully liberalized, and the real exchange rate since has been roughly stable.

and Azerbaijan have indicated-a willingness to participate in efforts to ensure transparent

during implementation and operation o f the B T C pipeline. At the same time the South Caucasus
Pipeline (SCP) would transport about 6.6 b c m in 2009, o f which Georgia would be entitled to 5
percent. Assuming that this gas gets monetized, the revenue effect o f B T C and SCP together
would be about 1 percent o f GDP.

I

Inflation and Fiscal Outlook. Assuming improved fiscal and monetary policies (a
9.
coherent economic program with particular emphasis on improved revenue collection), the fiscal
deficit (on a commitment basis) i s projected o n average to remain below 0.5 percent o f GDP, and
the cash deficit to average 1.0 percent o f GDP, assuming that the stock o f domestic arrears are
fully cleared by 2009. The tax-to-GDP ratio for the general government is assumed to increase
by 1.4 percentage points o f GDP in 2003, and by 0.8 percentage point each year thereafter, with
central government revenue increasing from 8.5 percent o f GDP in 2000 t o a still very l o w 11.4

-4-

percent o f GDP by 2005. The average rate o f inflation i s projected to stay around 5 percent per
year. Gross reserves are projected at 1.1 months o f imports in 2003, and to increase gradually to

1.8 months o f imports b y 2007.

10.
External Balances and Sustainability. Gross international reserves amount to a l i t t l e
over one month’s imports, and the economy thus remains vulnerable to external shocks. Debt
service obligations absorb more than one-third o f central government revenue. In addition, real
interest rates, though declining, are still about 20 percent, reflecting high-risk premiums for
lending activities. Official grants and loans through 2005 are projected t o average US$59 and
US$139 million, respectively.
1 1.
The bulk o f Georgia’s external debt was accumulated after independence during the early
1990s. By 1994, following the civil war and economic collapse, nominal public debt had
climbed to US$1 billion, or 81 percent o f GDP, much o f it stemming from energy sector
borrowing. In the context o f macroeconomic adjustment and more limited borrowing, the pace
o f indebtedness slowed during the second half o f the 1990s, although the debt continued to grow
in absolute terms. By 1999, the debt stock had risen to US$1.7 billion, but the ratio to GDP had
declined to 60 percent, following strong output growth in the second h a l f o f the decade. With
l i t t l e net borrowing, debt accumulation has further slowed in recent years, to a stock o f US$1.8
billion at end-2002.
12.
FSU countries (especially Russia and Turkmenistan) accounted for 65 percent o f total
claims in 1994, but their share had come down to 38 percent by 1998 and 31 percent by 2002.
Claims by Paris Club creditors, excluding Russia, have been relatively l o w (around 10 percent)
and have increased only slightly since 1994. In turn, the share o f IMF and World Bank claims
has risen steadily since 1994, reaching 37 percent in 1998 and 45 percent in 2002.
13.
During 1995-98, Georgia’s bilateral debt was rescheduled through 11 independent
country-specific deals. However, Georgia soon began to accumulate arrears on some o f the
rescheduled debt. In 200 1, the Paris Club granted a flow rescheduling o f principal obligations o n
“enhanced Houston terms.” These reschedulings have implied little relief in NPV terms. The
N P V o f debt and scheduled debt service relative to exports are 148 percent and 23 percent
respectively. Indicators in relation to central government revenue are much less favorable. At
end-2002, the ratio o f NPV o f debt to government revenue was 500 percent, while scheduled
debt service payments amounted to 51 percent o f revenue. This reflects partly Georgia’s
extremely l o w central government revenue collections, presently less than 10 percent o f GDP.
14.
The CAS baseline scenario i s predicated o n continued implementation o f economic
reforms. Annual average real GDP growth is projected to be in the 3.5-5.0 percent range during
2003-15, although growth rates may be higher in the initial years because o f the impact o f
construction o f the B T C pipeline. In their scenario planning the IMF and the Bank have used a
conservative assumption o f 4 percent until 2008, and 3.5 percent thereafter. The current account
deficit -- excluding pipeline construction-related imports -- would decline progressively, with
exports and imports assumed to grow at an annual average o f about 7 percent over 2003-08, and
at about 5 percent thereafter. The real exchange rate is assumed to remain constant at its endM a y 2003 level. The ratio o f central government revenue t o GDP is assumed to grow, o n

-5-

average, 0.6 percentage points per annum. Financing gaps are assumed to be filled through a
combination o f grants and concessional loans.
15.
The baseline scenario envisages a steady improvement in debt indicators (see Table 3).
The ratio o f NPV o f debt to exports i s projected to fall to 123 percent by 2005 and then to
stabilize at 80 percent by 2015. The debt service ratio would be reduced to 15 percent by 2005,
10 percent by 2008, and under 7 percent in the outer years. Debt indicators relative to
government revenue also show a steady improvement, but would remain high throughout most o f
the projection period. The N P V o f debt to revenue ratio would fall below 250 percent by 2008,
and under 200 percent by 2010. The associated debt service ratio would be 24 percent in 2008,
declining to 12 percent by 2015. These projections reflect a relatively slow improvement in
central government revenue, from a very l o w base, to 16 percent by 201 5.
16.
Stress tests show that the medium-term debt dynamics can be highly sensitive to some
alternative assumptions. Under more sluggish export growth or an exogenous increase in debt
(e.g., through the assumption o f significant non-guaranteed liabilities by the government), the
ratio o f the NPV o f debt to exports would increase by up to 40 percentage points, climbing to
almost 173 percent under the latter scenario in 2004. The ratio o f debt service to exports would
go up by 10-15 percentage points relative to the baseline, reaching 24-30 percent in 2005.
Changes o f this magnitude could put the balance o f payments under severe stress, especially
given Georgia’s weak international reserve position.
17.
Indicators relative to government revenue would also deteriorate sharply under certain
scenarios. For example, under a hypothetical 30 percent real depreciation in 2004, the NPV ratio
would jump to 467 percent and would remain above 300 percent through 2008; the associated
debt service ratio would increase to 60 percent and then decline to under 40 percent by 2007.

A restructuring on Naples terms would have a significant impact o n the various debt
indicators. Under this scenario, the ratios o f NPV o f debt to exports and revenue would decline
to 98 percent and 275 percent (in the base year), respectively (Table 3). The corresponding debt
service ratios would decrease by an average o f 6 and 20 percentage points over the period 200406 compared to the baseline. The ratio o f debt service t o exports would reach single digits by
2004, while the debt servicehevenue ratio would fall t o under 25 percent by the same year,
below 20 percent by 2006, and to 10 percent by 2015. The path and level o f the debt service
ratios suggest that Georgia’s external debt would become manageable with a stock operation on
Naples terms.
19.
Relations with the IMF. Improved fiscal management since mid-2000 paved the way
for approval o f a new three-year program under the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). Disbursements under the previous Fund program had been suspended as fiscal
performance deteriorated in the run-up to the 2000 presidential elections. The first and second
reviews under the current PRGF took place in October 2001 and July 2002, respectively. At 2
percent o f GDP, the fiscal deficit was slightly higher than programmed because o f shortfalls in
external financing, and revenue collection improved only slightly from 14.3 percent o f GDP t o
14.4 percent over the period. An IMF mission that visited Georgia in July 2003 t o discuss
completion o f the postponed third review found that new fiscal pressures had emerged, with tax
revenue falling short o f budget targets, and an accumulation o f substantial new budget arrears.
The IMF thus saw the need inter alia t o introduce tax reform measures, adjust electricity tariffs
and revise the 2003 budget t o close the fiscal gap. The authorities achieved the first t w o but
were unable to secure parliamentary approval o f a revised budget. Although i t was not possible
t o complete the third review, the IMF has been providing technical advice t o Georgia o n the
2004 budget, and will begin discussions in January 2004, when the current PRGF expires, o n a
possible new program to support Georgia’s EDPRP.

20.
Economic Opportunities and Obstacles. Given the small size o f Georgia’s domestic
market, higher growth rates will need t o come increasingly f r o m export expansion, especially in
those sectors where the country has a comparative advantage and the potential t o create
significant new j o b opportunities, such as agriculture and agro-processing. Fortunately, Georgia
has a well-educated and relatively low-cost labor force, which could allow it t o be competitive in
producing high value goods and services. In addition, while much o f the country’s physical
capital base has depreciated, there are still large pockets o f equipment and facilities that can be
used in export production. Georgia also has significant transportation infrastructure facilities,
and i s located close t o important regional and European markets. Being the most direct link
between the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea and Central Asian countries, Georgia has the potential t o
become a regional transit hub, particularly for rapidly growing oil-producing countries such as
Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. In the next few years, construction activity and transit fees f r o m
energy pipelines will also bolster the economy.

21.

M u c h o f Georgia’s policy framework favors competitive exports. The trade regime i s
liberal (despite some recent increases in tariff rates and coverage), and Georgia faces n o
significant trade barriers in world markets, having been a member o f WTO since June 2000.
Realizing this export potential will require concerted action t o address the governance issues
outline above, which raise the risks and cost o f doing business in Georgia and undermine
exporters’ competitiveness. In the absence o f much FDI and interaction with foreign buyers,

-7most Georgian firms have limited access to adequate technology and marketing skills that are
essential to being competitive in world markets. This often results in l o w labor productivity
despite the good education levels. Productivity differentials between Georgia and its rivals are
larger than their wage differentials, indicating that Georgia's low-wage advantage i s being eroded
by i t s productivity disadvantage. This i s part o f the reason why sectors that are highly
competitive internationally such as garments and wood processing have not flourished in
Georgia.
22.
Earlier studies by FIAS and IDA', and a the recent FY03 Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study, suggest an agenda o f challenges in order for Georgia to be able to realize i t s export
potential. They include: (i)
lack o f access for exporters to inputs at world prices, particularly
a
those procured in the domestic market, because the VAT refund mechanism i s unreliable; (ii)
tax code that i s subject to frequent changes as well as unpredictable and corrupt administrative
practices; (iii)
high transportation costs due to unofficial payments to border agencies and the
road police; (iv) widespread smuggling, reflecting corruption and weak customs administration;
(v) high cost and collateral requirements o f finance when it i s available; (vi) lack o f enforcement
o f intellectual property rights; (vii) national standards that are not recognized outside the CIS
region; (viii) inadequate and unreliable power supply; and (ix) obstacles to rural market
integration, including poor rural transport and market infrastructure, weak rural/farmer
organizations, and petty corruption along market routes. This environment encourages the
proliferation o f informal and small-scale activities, creates a strong bias against formal domestic
tradable activities, and does not allow the already small domestic market to become a platform
for export growth.

As indicated above, infrastructure constraints limit Georgia's growth prospects. Since
23.
independence, Georgia has experienced frequent power cuts and limited supply o f gas and
electricity during the winter. The increase in energy import prices led t o a six-fold decrease in
gas imports and rendered thermal power generation uneconomical, causing overall electricity
generation t o f a l l by more than half. The country n o w relies largely o n hydro-electric stations
for i t s power supply, but the largest one by far - Enguri - lies in the territory partially controlled
by the breakaway region o f Abkhazia, and more than a third o f Enguri's electricity production i s
consumed by Abkhazia without any payment. Collection rates o n electricity that finds i t s way t o
domestic consumers have been low, especially outside Tbilisi. Collection rates o n gas consumption have been l o w throughout the country. A s a consequence, energy infrastructure has been
poorly maintained and the sector has accumulated significant external debts in the order o f 20
percent o f GDP by end-2002, and the quasi-fiscal deficit i s estimated at almost 6 percent o f

GDP.

24.

This situation persists despite sound legal and policy reforms t o demonopolize and
privatize the electricity sector. Generation, transmission and distribution have been separated,
and are n o w largely under private ownership or management contracts. Reforms in the gas
sector have followed a similar path - although at a slower pace - with large private Russian
interests in transmission and distribution. The BEEPS shows that f i r m s in Georgia o n average
lose more than 60 business days per year due to power outages. Governance issues at all levels corporate, as well as regional and central government - have been the m a i n problem.
See FIAS, Administrative Barriers to Investment (June 2001) and the Cost o f Doing Business Survey (2001).

Telecommunications, o n the other hand, i s generally at a more advanced stage than other
South Caucasus countries, with relatively cheap access. Similarly, the main roads are being
renovated and the established road fund i s proving helpful. Emphasis in future needs to shift to
improving secondary roads and access to telecommunication in rural areas, in order t o take
advantage o f Georgia’s potential for export o f agricultural products.

Poverty Trends and the MDGs
26.
Georgians have experienced a severe decline in welfare since independence. Annual
income per capita is about 56 percent below the pre-independence level, unemployment rates are
high (16 percent in 2001), and many Georgians are underemployed. In the circumstances,
poverty, vulnerability and inequality have all increased over the period. Georgia clearly needs t o
achieve and sustain higher economic growth rates to improve living conditions. Given the small
size o f the domestic market, this can be achieved only through a stronger expansion in export
activities, especially o f those in which Georgia has a comparative advantage and the potential to
generate new j o b opportunities, such as agro-processing. Equally important i s reliable delivery
o f quality services, such as education, health, roads, electricity, heating, and clean water, and a
w e l l targeted social safety net.

Poverty Profile. Strengthened economic performance did result in a reduction o f
27.
poverty in the mid-1990s. However, Georgia’s growth rate slowed considerably between 1998
and 2000, and consequently inequality and poverty, as measured by any o f several
methodologies, increased (see Table 4). Growth was affected by a number o f shocks, including
the 1998 Russian crisis, severe droughts in 1998 and 2000, and the increase in the price o f
energy imports in 2000. These problems were compounded by internal and extemal political
instability. Growth has been recovering since 2001 (Table l),
leading to a slight reduction in
overall poverty.

-9-

Differential Impact o f Rising Poverty. IDA, in close collaboration with the State
Department o f Statistics, prepared a Poverty Update for Georgia covering the 1998-2000 period.
The study found that the increase in poverty affected various socio-economic groups differently,
with growing differentiation among the poor, and signs that the poorest became even poorer.
Poverty depth and severity both increased. Driven by the volatile economic environment and
absence o f an adequate safety net, vulnerability to poverty for the average household rose
significantly, with female-headed households being the most vulnerable. Although the extent o f
absolute poverty at any point in time remained around 20-24 percent, 40 percent o f the
population experienced poverty at least once during the year 1999-2000, and 60 percent o f the
population faced a real risk o f experiencing poverty in the medium term.

28.

29.
The trend in overall poverty reflects somewhat different developments in urban and rural
poverty. In 1997, rural and urban poverty incidence were almost the same. In 1999, the urban
poverty headcount doubled in comparison to 1997, whilst the rural headcount increased by only
37.3 percent. Then in 2000, responding to the non-agricultural sector recovery after the Russian
crisis, urban poverty dropped by 10.2 percent, stabilized in 2001 and declined further by 6.2
percent in 2002. Because o f the drought, however, rural poverty increased in 2000, remained
unchanged in 2001 and only in 2002 decreased by 2.9 percent. A s a result, the difference
between the urban and rural headcount has narrowed -- while in 1999, the urban poverty
headcount was almost 50 percent over that in the rural population, in 2002 it was only 9 percent
higher.
30.
Determinants o f Poverty. The Georgia Poverty Update identified that the strongest
determinants o f poverty risk in Georgia were economic: employment status, sector o f
employment, ownership o f productive assets and education. It found an elevated poverty risk
among urban households, households with an unemployed head and female headed households,
as well as children aged 7- 15, the disabled, those with l o w levels o f education, single pensioners
and orphans. The working poor are becoming the majority, often employed in the informal
sector with insecure, temporary and l o w productivity jobs.
Non-Income Indicators o f Poverty. Non-income indicators o f poverty in Georgia,
3 1.
inherited from Soviet times, s t i l l compare favorably with those o f countries with similar per
capita income. The UNDP 2003 Human Development Report ranks Georgia 88'h among 175
nations. However, Georgia faces a major challenge in sustaining these relatively favorable
indicators. Studies conducted by various international organizations (UNICEF, U S A I D, EC,
etc.) indicate that maternal mortality, immunization rates, access to health, safe water and
sanitation, and the quality o f social services have worsened in comparison with the pre-transition
situation.
Millennium Development Goals. The estimates o f Georgia's prospects for achieving
32.
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are indicated in Table 5.
Capacity to Monitor Poverty. Starting in mid-1996, with technical assistance from
33.
IDA, DFID and other donors, household surveys have been conducted in Georgia o n a quarterly
basis, The surveys provide detailed information from 3,350 households o n property, economic
status, incomes, expenditures, consumption, household composition and demographics. In 2000,

consumption. These surveys provide a wealth o f information necessary for monitoring poverty
and the implementation o f Georgia’s EDPFW. Significant capacity to analyze the survey data
has been developed at the State Department o f Statistics (SDS), although current budget
constraints pose risks for adequately maintaining this work. The capacity to collect reliable
administrative data on the non-income dimensions o f poverty could be strengthened.

34.
Internally Displaced People. There are over 250,000 IDPs in Georgia. Their vulnerability to poverty i s magnified by their lack o f access to land. Thus IDPs living in collective
centers are 3% times less likely to have access to land than the local population, and those living
in private accommodations half as likely. In addition, IDPs’ rate o f unemployment i s very high 40 percent among IDPs living in collective centers. Government benefits do seem, however, to
be reaching the IDPs, with 80 percent to 90 percent receiving a government benefit.
35.
Gender Issues. Gender inequality does not appear to be a major problem in Georgia,
although data deficiencies do not permit deep enough analysis to reach definitive conclusion.
According to official statistics, women make up 48 percent o f the labor force. Education
outcomes are comparable by gender, with women having only slightly lower secondary
completion rates than men, but higher enrollment in tertiary education. The legal framework for
women’s rights i s sound, and they enjoy equal access to property and protection o f property
rights. Given tight fiscal constraints, free universal access to daycare and kindergarten i s no
longer provided, affecting women’s labor market participation. Women represent only 7 percent
o f Parliamentarians (although this includes the Chairwoman o f Parliament), and hold only two o f
the 16 cabinet positions, but a large number o f women serve as deputy ministers and department
heads, and women have a large role in public life. Georgia’s economic difficulties and the
continued impact o f civil conflicts have put greater demands on women, with an increasing
number responsible for supporting their families (thus women are the main source o f income
among IDPs). Men have suffered too, both psychologically from feeling they have failed in their
role as providers, and physically, with increased incidence o f alcoholism and heart disease.
Increasing economic growth, settling o f conflicts, and improving the situation o f IDPs will go far
in improving the lives o f both women and men.
36.
Core Labor Standards. Georgia i s among the countries that have ratified all the I L O
conventions pertaining to the core labor standards: (i)
elimination o f all forms o f forced or
compulsory labor; (ii)
effective abolition o f child labor, with priority to the worst forms; (iii)
equal opportunity and non-discrimination in employment; and (iv) freedom o f association and
the right to collective bargaining. The provisions o f the conventions have been incorporated into
various elements o f Georgian legislation. Further detail i s provided in Attachment 111. However,
no assessment has yet been initiated regarding their implementation, and Georgia i s behind in
providing reports due to the I L O
Governance
37.
A key constraint to Georgia’s development i s i t s difficult governance environment,
including both weaknesses in public sector coordination and implementation capacity, and some
aspects o f corruption. As discussed below, bribery appears to be getting worse at a time when
neighboring countries are seeing improvements. The Government has become fragmented, with

- 13 the excellent w o r k o f many pockets o f professionalism diluted by lack o f complementary support
from other agencies. There are fears that the sustainability o f donor-financed projects may be
compromised by lack o f follow-through once the projects close. Among the contributing factors
underlying this situation are: (i)
the fact that, as a relatively young state, Georgia has had to set
up entirely n e w legal, government, and accountability structures and systems; (ii)
geo-political
fragmentation and lack o f strong leadership f r o m Tbilisi; (iii)a weak and poorly paid and
equipped c i v i l service operating without basic public sector management systems; (iv) a tradition
o f close-knit clan and family based loyalties; and (v) a broad acceptance o f avoiding obligations
to central government authority. Governance problems and corruption undermine Georgia’s
competitiveness and hamper the creation o f jobs crucial for combating poverty. Furthermore,
these problems mean that the efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures and services are
sub optimal, which hurts the poor disproportionably.

38.
Despite these problems, the Government has had some important successes in structural
reform. Privatization o f telecommunications and energy started earlier than in most F S U
countries, and there have been various legal reforms t o improve the business climate. Unpopular
but necessary tax reform and electricity tariff increases have been passed at various stages,
including in recent months, and health sector restructuring i s underway, although in Tbilisi it has
faced significant opposition. The benefits o f these and other structural reforms are, however,
often hindered by poor implementation - thus the privatization o f electricity distribution did not,
for example, yield the expected returns, partly because weak l a w and order have hindered
payment collection.

Financial Sector. Georgia’s financial system is dominated by its banking sector, which
is small by regional and international standards. The central bank, the National Bank o f Georgia
(NBG), has a large degree o f independence, and over time has introduced tighter prudential
requirements, stricter loan classification and provisioning rules, as w e l l as better accounting
standards. There are n o barriers t o entry for banks, and foreign banks are present. However, the
weak economy undermines investment in this sector despite structural reforms pursued since
1995. Bank capital i s 26 percent o f total assets, which i s relatively high, and reflects excess

40.

- 14liquidity in the banking system. This excessive liquidity mainly results from: (i)undeveloped
credit skills and credit policy in banks (such as lending overly relying o n collateral rather than
based o n cash-flow); (ii)lack o f credit information; (iii)excess T-bill yields due t o a weak
primary T-bill market. The risk-aversion o f the lending institutions has led t o relatively l o w
levels o f financial intermediation, and impedes enterprises access to finance. N e w legislation
has recently been adopted to address money laundering, but it requires some strengthening. The
National Bank o f Georgia will be primarily responsible for implementation and i s attempting to
build capacity t o implement the l a w and regulations to ensure that Georgia’s anti-money
laundering framework meets international standards.

Corruption is limiting the benefits o f an otherwise improved business environment.
Enterprises o f every size report being harassed from all sides, and there is a perception
that there is an effective ceiling o n enterprise growth for those without special influence.
Weak and corruption-ridden enforcement authorities have contributed to a climate where
crime and security issues are perceived to be more pervasive than in neighboring
Caucasus countries. The end result has been serious difficulty in attracting much needed
private investment.
N o t surprisingly, the shadow sector o f the economy is growing, and n o w constitutes
maybe a third o f GDP. This large shadow economy, combined with pervasive corruption
in tax and customs administration, has kept public revenues under 15 percent o f GDP,
w e l l below potential. Lack o f revenue and poor governance have severely hampered
progress in education, health and social protection, slowed the maintenance and rehabilitation o f vital infrastructure, and contributed to unreliable and l o w quality utility
services.
The national budget covers only a one-year cycle, and its strategic foundation i s weak.
Overall resource allocation i s not w e l l linked to sector objectives, programs or policies.
The EDPRP team made an attempt t o cost and phase development priorities, and thereby
develop the medium-term expenditure implications, but in practice the three planning
tools - the EDPRP, the medium-term Indicative Plan, and the annual budget - are not yet
adequately integrated into an effective cycle o f policy formulation, budget preparation
and decision-making.

Fiscal Decentralization and Local Governance. In addition t o the central government,
there are three levels o f decentralized government: regions, rayons, and local self-governing
units. Resource transfers to these decentralized bodies levels are unpredictable, incentives for
increased regional tax collection effort are inadequate, and the distribution o f resources across
local government units i s highly inequitable. A number o f expenditure responsibilities have been
delegated to the local level, but without ensuring proper funding f r o m the center. At the same
time, the center attempts to regulate expenditures by enforcing national norms. Such rigidities
create perverse incentives and perpetuate inefficiencies in the allocation o f public resources. The
consequences o f the system are duplication or under-provision o f basic public services (e.g.,
water and electricity), under-funding o f key expenditures such as teachers’ salaries, and

- 15 accumulation o f arrears. Furthermore, there are large disparities in per capita spending by
regions and rayons, with poorer local government units spending much less than well-off ones.

111. THEWORLD BANKGROUP’S
TRACKRECORD IN GEORGIA
IDA ’s Country Portfolio and Non-LendingProgram

43.
IDA lending to Georgia since its inception in FY95 has totaled $730.2 million for 33
credits (for 31 projects), o f which 16 have been completed. The current portfolio consists o f 17
credits (including one supplemental) totaling $297.2 million (of which $190.8 million was
undisbursed as o f October 6, 2003). In addition, three GEF projects have been approved for
Georgia, amounting to $12.5 million. Since Georgia joined the I F C in 1995, I F C has approved
$103.8 million o f investments in 8 projects. IFC’s held portfolio in Georgia as o f October 2003
amounted to $27 million (4 projects).

44.
In preparation for this CAS, IDA’s Country Team commissioned an Independent Portfol i o Review (IPR) in Novembermecember 2002, which was then followed by a Joint Portfolio
Review (JPR) with the authorities in January 2003. The objective o f the IPR was to have an
independent assessment o f the health o f the portfolio, i t s appropriateness in light o f earlier CAS
objectives and evolving country conditions, and to provide guidance to the country team o n ways
to improve the effectiveness o f IDA assistance to Georgia. The IPR found that most projects
were relevant and generally w e l l managed and supervised, although a weak governance and
economic policy environment appeared to be limiting the potential impact and sustainability.
Projects tended to be successful in delivering their planned inputs and outputs, but sustaining
results were less certain due to lack o f funding for maintenance and operation, and the fragility
o f implementation arrangements -- projects had to rely o n Project Implementation Units (PIUs)
to create islands o f efficiency and integrity, with the future o f these PIUs uncertain once the
project ends. In some cases sustainability apparently has been achieved through the use o f
autonomous agencies (the Social and Municipal Development Funds), through the more privatesector oriented projects, and through the use o f community organizations. The I P R also
concluded that many operations would benefit from a better definition o f expected outcomes and
interim outputs. The follow-on JPR initiated a dialogue with all counterpart entities, and work i s
underway, led by the Country Office in Tbilisi, to develop such indicators for operations where
they were lacking at the initial stage. Drawing on the IPR, QAG and OED reports, ICRs and its
own supervision work, the Georgia Country Team has identified some main conclusions
regarding what IDA’s assistance efforts have accomplished in Georgia to date and the lessons
learned to improve future effectiveness.
strengthen
Evaluation o f the Last CAS. The objectives o f the last C A S were to: (i)
45.
deepen and diversify sources o f growth; (iii)
introduce policy and institutional
public finance; (ii)
reforms to protect Georgia’s environment and natural resources; and (iv) reduce poverty - the
overarching objective. The Country Team concluded that these objectives were appropriate and
represented the depth and breadth o f the country’s development challenges, but overestimated
the capacity o f the Government t o sustain the reform momentum o f the mid-1990s. The risks
were correctly identified and remain relevant: failure to reach expected outcomes due either to
unsatisfactory implementation o f policies and/or deterioration in the external environment; risk

- 16o f policy reversal from vested interests; and renewed c i v i l conflicts.
governance factors were, however, underestimated.

The risks related to

46.

Support f o r Structural Reform. Considerable progress has been made in supporting
structural reform, including trade liberalization, legal and regulatory reform, privatization and
liberalization, banking sector restructuring, and judicial and health sector reforms. However,
weakened fiscal management, less than sufficient public sector capacity, and poor govemance
have diluted these successes. These constraints have affected the implementation o f secondgeneration reforms requiring sustained commitment across Government, and an increased
capacity to evaluate, design, monitor and enforce implementation. Subsequent to the IPR, in
early FY04 OED completed a review o f IDA adjustment and related technical assistance
operations in Georgia, and downgraded several ratings initially assigned at the time o f project
closing, for many o f the same reasons identified in the IPR.

47.

Reducing Poverty. IDA interventions in the human development sectors have aimed at
improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f public services, while at the same time explicitly
emphasizing strategies and interventions that target poor and vulnerable population groups,
including by improving their access to social services. Economic and sector work in human
development, as w e l l as policy advice and dialogue based o n E S W findings, have assisted the
Government in defining strategic options in health, education and social protection, and guided
the Bank’s project work in these areas. E S W has consisted o f a note o n Options for Pension
Reform, a Poverty Update, and studies o f health, education and social protection in the Public
Expenditure Review. The f i r s t Health Project closed o n December 3 1, 2002. The I C R for the
project evaluates the achievement o f the project objective as mixed; unsatisfactory regarding the
impact o n the health o f the population, and satisfactory concerning the project’s substantial
contribution towards reorienting the sector and strengthening institutions at the central level.

48.
Social Sectors. Projects currently under implementation include an Education System
Strengthening and Realignment Project (APL), a Primary Health Care Development Project,
and a Structural Reform Support Project (SRSP), which include components for pensions and
hospital restructuring, and a Social Investment Fund (SIF) Project. The education project aims at
improving learning outcomes in primary and secondary education, the health care projects at
improving financing and access to primary care services. The pension component o f the SRSP
helped develop a management information system, including individual accounts, for the
Georgian pension system; the ongoing health component i s rehabilitating the hospital sector.
The SIF provided urgently needed assistance to poor and vulnerable communities. While it is
premature to assess the outcomes o f the ongoing projects in health and education, the SIF has
already funded some four hundred micro-projects which rehabilitate small-scale social and
economic infrastructure, thus improving access to better-quality essential services. A US$5
m i l l i o n supplement t o the SIF was approved in February 2003 t o rehabilitate schools in Tbilisi
damaged by the 2002 earthquake. A second SIF project that focuses o n community mobilization
and small-scale infrastructure development was approved by IDA’SBoard o f Directors in M a y
2003, and unanimously approved by the Georgian parliament in August 2003.
Infrastructure. The Roads Project has led t o a substantial improvement in the m a i n
road network, thus reducing road transport costs and improving access t o the major traffic
corridors; institutional strengthening i s underway, and there has been a marked improvement in

49.

- 17the performance o f local contractors. The Energy Transit Institution Building project has helped
the Government improve i t s capacity to negotiate and implement o i l and gas transit agreements
maximize economic benefits, and minimize social and environmental costs. The Electricity
Market Support is n o w underway after a year’s delays in hiring a management contractor for
transmission and dispatch. The South Caucasus Trade and Transport Facilitation Study was
completed in 2002, and was followed by a Policy Note which will form a basis for the proposed
FY05 Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. In the power sector a study -- Revisiting
Reform: Lessonsfiom Georgia -- reviewed the recent changes in the supply o f electricity and gas
f r o m the perspective o f the households, utility operators, and Government representatives.
Households continue to have high levels o f access to network services, but the numbers mask
poor service and supply shortages, particularly outside Tbilisi. Despite rapid increases in the
price o f electricity and non-network fuels, the share o f government spending o n energy has
remained constant. The study recommends that subsidies be targeted using actual levels o f
electricity consumption, and that they be sufficient to ensure that households can pay for a basic
minimum level o f electricity consumption.

50.

Public Finance and Procurement. There were some improvements in public finance,
supported by the Structural Reform Support Project, including the strengthening o f the treasury
system. Since late 2002, however, the reform momentum has been compromised because o f an
overall deterioration in the economic and political environment. This has also put at risk the
sustainability o f earlier achievements. The recent FY03 Public Expenditure Review provides a
diagnosis and recommendations for expenditure and management reforms. The Government has
yet to follow up o n many o f these recommendations, although a number have been included in
the EDPRP. AAA has also included the Country Procurement Assessment Report issued in June
2002, and the FY03 Country Financial Accountability Assessment, which was discussed with
key Government counterparts in June 2003.
Environment and Natural Resources. IDA has assisted Georgia in developing a
51.
National Environmental Action Plan, a National Black Sea Action Plan, and a National Oil Spill
Contingency Plan to deal with existing and future risks o f o i l pollution in the Black Sea coast.
However, institutional and financial constraints compounded by limited political will have
resulted in slow implementation o f these plans. Assistance has been provided for the
establishment o f operational protected areas: 46,000 ha for protecting and managing threatened
forest and wetlands habitats along the Black Sea, and 184,000 h a for protecting and managing
three areas in the Caucasus Mountains. Activities have been supported t o enhance public
awareness and interest o n the protection o f critical wetlands along the Black Sea, with some
visible results. Efforts t o establish a sustainable and effective integrated coastal zone
management system have produced only modest results to date.
IFC Support. IFC’s lending and investments in Georgia have been tailored t o the
52.
country’s special circumstances: limited foreign investments, the non-existence o f large local
companies, limited access t o financing f o r a nascent SME sector, and the lack o f advice f o r
private companies o n business-related issues such as corporate governance and leasing. I F C has
supported:
L o c a l Companies, for example GG&MW, a mineral water production company, where
IFC’s loans supported the company’s acquisition o f key strategic assets and strengthened

- 18 control over i t s key brand, Borjomi mineral water. IFC’s equity investment helped the
company rehabilitate two mineral water bottling facilities, diversify i t s product m i x and
develop the distribution network. IFC sold i t s stake in the company in 2002.

Foreign Investments. IFC invested in equity and provided loans to Ksani Glass
Factory, a producer o f high-quality glass bottles and packaging. The $2.5 million equity
investment and $6.3 million loan supported Ksani’s expansion and modernization. At
project completion, the facility will be producing 40,000 tons o f high quality glass bottles
annually with a high level o f product flexibility. In the power sector IFC provided a $30
million loan to AES Corporation to support the newly privatized Tbilisi area power
distribution company Telasi. The loan was pre-paid in August 2003, when the AES
corporation sold the Tbilisi electricity distribution system to UES. In the o i l and gas
sector, IFC supported BP and other sponsors by financing the construction o f the BakuSupsa Early Oil Pipeline, which carries Caspian oil to Georgia’s Black Sea coast. IFC’s
investment in the Georgian portion o f the pipeline was made in 1998 and totaled $30
million.

SME Sector. To reach small and medium enterprises, IFC provided equity and long-term
credit lines to TBC Bank and helped establish Georgia Microfinance Bank - the
Procredit Bank - the country’s first bank specializing in lending to micro and small
enterprises. In June 2000, IFC purchased a 10 percent stake in TBC Bank. IFC’s support
helped TBC to grow from a “pocket” bank into the largest and one o f the best performing
commercial banking institutions in Georgia. In 1999, IFC helped establish the Procredit
Bank -- the first bank dedicated to lending to micro and small enterprises in the country,
and now the fastest growing banking institution in Georgia.
Development o f M o r t g a g e Lending. In the financial sector, IFC has focused on
supporting the development o f the housing finance market. The introduction o f mortgage
financing has allowed individuals for the first time to leverage their residences to raise
their standard o f living. In 2000, IFC extended a $3 million credit line to the Bank of
Georgia, and together with reflows, this credit l i n e financed over 500 projects totaling
$4.5 million. In June 2003, IFC provided a second $5 million credit line to the Bank o f
Georgia for housing finance and for on-lending to small and medium enterprises. In
August 2001, IFC provided a second $3 million loan to TBC Bank to support the
development o f i t s mortgage lending.

Lessons learned

53.
Georgia’s rapid initial progress with first generation reforms during the last decade led to
over-optimism as to the speed at which deeper reforms could be implemented. In particular,
IDA underestimated the pervasive impact o f weak governance on policy making and
implementation. Some key analytical work was delayed (e.g., the Public Expenditure Review),
partly to accommodate increased supervision needs o f an expanding portfolio. In retrospect this
was inadvisable, and economic and sector work has been given higher priority in the proposed
FY04-06 strategy. Given the Government’s weak capacity, there will be a focus on supporting
policy and institutional reform, and project supervision i s being funded at higher than standard
coefficients to allow intensive oversight, including strong attention to fiduciary aspects.

- 19Responsibility for supervision has been decentralized to the Georgia Country Office in Tbilisi,
and the Country Office has been strengthened by appointment o f a procurement officer.
Improved coordination with other donors, some with large technical assistance programs in k e y
areas, will be a crucial component o f the strategy.

The IPR noted that five mechanisms seem t o have had a good track record o f producing
54.
tangible development outcomes even in this poor implementation environment:
The use o f autonomous institutions like the Social Investment Fund and the Municipal
Development Fund that can be financially self-sustaining;
Community-based efforts that do not rely heavily o n central government institutions, such
as the irrigation and drainage project that i s helping to build local social capital;
Private-sector led activities, that again do not rely heavily o n resources f r o m the central
government;
Empowerment o f c i v i l society organizations which can press for real and effective reform
in their respective spheres o f influence; and
Active stakeholder participation in the design o f projects.

55.

There are several implications o f the above findings. First, IDA needs t o pay m u c h
closer attention t o the broader institutional environment in Georgia, outside the immediate
PIUdagencies responsible for project implementation, given risks t o sustainability o f even very
good operations. Particularly close attention is needed to assessment o f governance factors
which may influence the possibilities for success in achieving and sustaining development
outcomes. Second, IDA investment lending should rely as heavily as possible o n the mechanisms identified above, where these are appropriate. Third, projects should include tangible
measures o f outcomes and impacts (including improved institutional effectiveness). Where these
may not exist for some ongoing projects they should be developed as soon as possible, and the
dialogue during supervision missions and future JPRs should focus more heavily o n these topics,
going beyond monitoringhesolving implementation issues. Fourth, Georgia would benefit f r o m
a stronger AAA and non-lending work program t o complement portfolio supervision and n e w
lending. The strategy outlined in Section V reflects these recommendations.

IV. GEORGIA’S
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AND POVERTY
REDUCTION
PROGRAM
56.

The Government finalized i t s PRSP (known in Georgia as the Economic Development
and Poverty Reduction and Program, EDPRP) in June 2003. The EDPRP builds o n the interim
strategy (I-PRSP) presented t o the Boards o f the IMF and IDA in January 2001. I t was
developed with strong participation by c i v i l society. The EDPRP and a Joint Staff Assessment
(JSA) were presented t o the Boards o f the IMF and IDA in October and November 2003,
respectively (Report No. 26964-GE).

57.

The EDPRP has two strategic objectives: (i)rapid and sustainable economic
development, with a target o f real GDP growth o f 5-8 percent a year; and (ii)
a reduction in

- 20 extreme poverty, with a target o f a decline from 14 percent now to 4-5 percent by 201 5, and a
reduction in overall poverty, from 52 percent n o w to 20-25 percent by 2015. T o meet these t w o
objectives the EDPRP focuses o n progress in governance, macroeconomic policies, particularly
in the fiscal area, the business environment, human capital, reducing the vulnerability o f the
poor, development o f priority sectors o f the economy -- energy, transport and communications,
tourism and agriculture, and the natural environment. The EDPRP also stresses the importance
o f addressing the needs o f post-conflict zones and o f science and information technology.

58.
As the JSA notes, the EDPRP presents a credible poverty reduction strategy and its broad
policy priorities are appropriate and consistent with the development challenges facing Georgia.
The main areas where further progress will be needed during implementation and subsequent
updates o f the EDPRF’ include: (i)
improve the consistency o f the budget process with the program; (ii)
ensure that the Ministry o f Finance and other key ministries are centrally involved in
implementing and further developing the program; (iii)
develop a prioritization o f the EDPRP’s
spending recommendations; (iv) implement measures t o improve governance and reduce corruption; and (v) develop more specific, quantified, outcome measures.

v.

THEWORLD BANKGROW’S
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

59.
The Country Assistance Strategy for FY04-06 selectively supports the implementation o f
the EDPRP in areas in which the Bank Group has a comparative advantage, and is closely
coordinated with activities o f other IFIs and donors. Within this framework, IDA will a i m t o
provide a level o f new financial assistance responsive to the authorities’ demonstrated
commitment to improve governance, and supported by AAA, non-lending and outreach activities
that may help build the foundation for institutional and policy renewal.
FYO4-06 CAS Objectives and Focus

60.
The C A S will support Georgia’s EDPRP by assisting the Government to: (i)
attain faster
and more broad-based private sector growth, through the removal o f policy, institutional and
infrastructure obstacles t o private sector development; (ii)
develop and strengthen human
capital and social protection, as well as environmental protection, both through short-term
interventions and longer-term sustainable programs t o protect the most vulnerable; (iii)
improve
governance and efficiency o f public expenditures, including the strengthening o f public
expenditure management through annual process-based public expenditure reviews. Improving
governance is a cross-cutting objective, which will be reflected in a l l n e w lending activities as
w e l l as enhanced supervision support for the ongoing portfolio.
(i)Faster and M o r e Broad-Based Private Sector Growth

61.

Constraints to Business Development. T o support private sector development and
attract needed foreign investment, the CAS strategy focuses o n removing key policy, institutional
and governance constraints, as well as financial, energy and infrastructure bottlenecks. On the
basis o f the FY03 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, IDA will provide reform support and
progress monitoring through the ongoing Enterprise Rehabilitation Project, an FY06 Private
Sector Development Project, and periodic Business Environment Surveys. IDA will also provide

-21 advisory support (in conjunction with USAID) for improving access to affordable finance
through further financial sector reform, and will help reduce trade, transit and marketing costs
through the FY0.5 Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, building o n the FY03 South
Caucasus Trade and Transport Facilitation Study. I F C will complement these activities through
selective investments in manufacturing, services, financial, natural resources and other sectors,
and through its advisory programs. Particular focus will be placed o n S M E development.
Support for alleviating energy bottlenecks will be provided by IDA’Songoing energy portfolio
and dialogue.
62.
According to the recently completed studies conducted by F I A S and IDA (para. 22
above), k e y policy constraints for private sector development also include corruption in the
administration o f taxes and customs, as well as lack o f confidence in the rule o f l a w (Le.,
enforcement o f contracts, property rights). To date, F I A S has undertaken five projects in
Georgia, including an analysis o f administrative barriers to investment in 2001. Their findings
are being incorporated in the Bank’s dialogue with the Government, with key measures t o be
included in any future PRSC. F I A S i s currently assisting the Government to implement the
recommendations o f the Study o f Administrative Barriers t o Investment in Georgia through
public private sector dialogue. Annual updates o f the Cost ofDoing Business Survey throughout
the C A S period will provide key monitoring indicators o f progress in this area. I F C would also
provide support directly t o the private sector through the Georgia Business Development Project,
a five-year technical assistance program implemented by the Private Enterprise Partnership with
the support o f the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The main components
o f the project include development o f the leasing sector, improvement o f corporate governance
practices. The corporate governance initiative i s helping Georgian businesses improve their
practices to build investor confidence and increase their access t o financing. This component o f
the program also includes advice t o the Government o n improving corporate governance policies
and regulations.
Support to SMEs. The Small and Medium Scale Enterprise (SME) sector i s a crucial
63.
area for potential private sector growth, and IDA has been supporting the sector through its ongoing Enterprise Rehabilitation Project. IDA plans, through the FY06 Private Sector Development Project, t o provide expanded support for management training, creation o f export-oriented
clusters o f SMEs, advice to business associations and government, and monitoring o f the business environment. Additionally, I F C will conduct a targeted study o f the S M E sector in Georgia
t o i d e n t i e key obstacles t o its development, and then recommend specific improvements in the
regulatory and administrative environment. In addition t o the Georgia Business Development
Project, and t o enhance the development impact o f the B T C pipeline project further, I F C has
dedicated staff in the region to develop the S M E linkages and community development programs. Proposals currently under discussion include the promotion o f energy efficiency, use o f
alternative energy and biodiversity, development o f community-based forest management and
reforestation initiatives, as w e l l as expansion o f IFC’s microfinance activities.

64.
Financial Sector R e f o r m . Reforms o f the financial sector will be crucial to the success
o f SMEs. IDA has accordingly been actively involved in encouraging financial sector reform
through the joint I M F - W o r l d Bank Financial Sector Advisory Program (FSAP), which has been
supporting: (i)strengthened banking and non-banking supervision; (ii)
introduction o f international accounting standards; (iii)consolidation o f banks through higher capital requirement

- 22 ratios; and (iv) anti money-laundering legislation. IDA i s also discussing possible support for
improvements in payment systems, and helping (with U SAID) to establish a secured interest/credit bureau. IFC i s complementing IDA’S financial sector advisory work with support to
the banking system. It i s providing funding through three leading Georgian banks, targeting
SME lending through i t s credit lines, equity participation, or a combination o f the two. IFC i s
also considering future mortgage financing projects and i s assessing additional ways to promote
SME development, including through a leasing company.

65.
Energy Sector. Energy i s another major bottleneck in Georgia, and the FYOl Electricity
Market Support project i s -- in close collaboration with KfW, USAID and EBRD -- introducing

internationally experienced private management for electricity transmission, dispatch, and the
wholesale market in an attempt to facilitate regional electricity trade, and introduce greater competitive pressure on electricity costs, and improve reliability o f supply. The Private Sector Advisory Service, managed by the World Bank Group, has advised the Government o f Georgia on
privatization o f electricity distribution and generation outside Tbilisi, hiring o f private f i r m s to
manage transmission network, system dispatch, and the wholesale electricity market. As a result
the management o f both the wholesale market and the transmission and dispatch networks has
been transferred to private foreign operators. However, results to date have not met expectations, and this has been one o f the most difficult areas in IDA’S ongoing portfolio in Georgia.
W h i l e policy and legal reforms have been impressive, implementation has been hampered b y
governance issues at all levels. Greater public support for improving tariff collections i s critical,
and IDA will work closely with the authorities, other donors, non-governmental organizations
and key stakeholders to try to achieve better knowledge and understanding by the public at large.
IFC investment program includes financing o f the BTC project (Box 1).

Box 1
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline i s a major new route for energy from the Caspian. IFC’s current
investment program includes financing of the BTC project, building on i t s investment in the
assist in
construction of the Baku-Supsa early oil pipeline. IFC’s role in the BTC project i s to: (i)
mitigating political risks and catalyzing significant long-term financing (both directly and by mobilizing
commercial bank funding through i t s B loans); (ii)provide a sustainable environmental and social
framework; (iii)initiate a Regional Review; (iv) undertake multi-stakeholder forums; (v) require
substantial transparency and disclosure; (vi) help other lenders follow standards consistent with the
WBG’s Safeguard Policies and Guidelines; (vii) help promote SME/community development,
complementing BP/BTC’s work on this; and (viii) help BP establish the Caspian Development Advisory
Panel (CDAP) to provide an independent review of BP‘s Caspian activities. Developmental impacts
include (a) avoidance of additional shipping through the Bosphorus; (b) approximately U S 2 9 billion in
revenues for Azerbaijan, US$580 million for Georgia and US3.4 billion for Turkey over 20 years,
based on full development of a l l phases of the ACG fields; (c) establishment o f environmental offsets
and Community/Social Investment Programs; and (d) development of new local jobs during
construction/operational phases. Both Georgia and Azerbaijan have indicated a willingness to
participate in efforts to ensure transparent reporting o f earnings, and the WGB will follow up and
provide support for this during implementation and operation of the BTC pipeline.

66.
Agricultural Reform Agenda. Agriculture and agro-processing have good growth
potential in Georgia, both for domestic and export markets. Maximizing this potential will
require: (i)
removing obstacles to market integration, by strengthening rural transport and market
infrastructure, promoting rural/farmer organizations, and reining in petty corruption along market
routes; (ii)
raising the productivity o f rural farmers, by facilitating the propagation and sale o f
improved seeds and other planting materials and strengthening advisory services through
collaborative public and private sector initiatives; and (iii)
supporting initiatives to enhance the
competitiveness o f selected industriedsub-sectors with evident growth potential and scope for
considerable employment-generation. This i s likely to include several fields o f agro-processing
and tourism. IDA assistance would also continue to focus o n the k e y areas o f land market
development, eliminating constraints on land market transactions, advancing land privatization
and completing land titling (working with other donors including KfW, EC, USAID, UNDP and
SIDA), and support for the agro-processing enterprise sector. Given agriculture’s strong linkage
t o rural poverty, the FY04 Constraints and Opportunities in Rural Growth Study and the FY05
Rural Development Project will seek to increase exports and rural incomes, including through
investments in agribusiness and export promotion, development o f better market knowledge and
infrastructure, and improvement o f small-scale rural infrastructure (e.g., roads) and off-farm
a GEF funded
employment opportunities. I F C i s exploring the possibility o f developing: (i)
project o n biodiversity and conservation o f the Georgian grape varieties, as well as a possible
investment in the bio-diverse, organic wine project; and (ii)other agribusiness projects as
opportunities emerge.

67.
Public Infrastructure and Services. Improving infrastructure i s also crucial t o rural
growth. The FYOO Roads and F Y 0 4 Secondary and Local Roads projects focus o n improving
transport infrastructure. Secondary and rural local roads are the most important rural infrastructure connecting agricultural areas t o market. According t o studies conducted elsewhere in the
region, poor road quality can add 28 percent t o 44 percent t o usage costs. Furthermore, poor
road quality can exacerbate poverty as poor households are disproportionately concentrated in
remote areas. I F C is also interested in supporting projects to develop the transport sector, taking
advantage o f Georgia’s strategic position between Europe and Asia.
68.

Provision o f other critical public infrastructure and services i s being supported through a
number o f ongoing projects: the FY03 Municipal Development and Decentralization (MDF),
FYOO Agriculture Research, Extension and Training, FYO1 Irrigation and Drainage Community
Development APL, the FYOl Electricity Market Support and the F Y 0 3 Social Investment Fund
projects. Proposed new projects include the F Y 0 4 Secondary and Local Roads Project and the
FY06 Rural Telecommunications LIL focused o n developing rural telecommunications in line
with the Government’s efforts t o improve access. A study o f Urban Housing will be completed
in FY04. Housing development i s also being supported by IFC’s credit lines which help finance
the development o f its mortgage lending. The credit lines are available through TBC Bank and
Bank of Georgia for real-estate based financing, including acquiring, constructing or upgrading
both commercial and residential property, and also for financing small and medium companies
for working capital and investment purposes. These loans were accompanied by U S A I D technical assistance to strengthen the banks’ mortgage lending policies and t o improve operations in
the area o f appraising, processing, and supervising mortgage loans.

- 24 69.
Community-based Tourism. An FY98 Cultural Heritage Project that focused o n
fostering market-oriented systems o f cultural heritage management, on the one hand, and a grant
o n the other, have highlighted Georgia’s potential for community-based tourism development.
Such activities have the potential t o serve as an important source o f non-farm income in selected
rural communities and small towns. The participatory approach taken by the project has also
made some contribution to promoting social and national cohesion, even in multi-ethnic and
conflict zones such as Javakheti and South Ossetia. A small FY0.5 Community-based Tourism
Project will build o n t h i s work t o identify regional tourism opportunities, (Trans-Caucasus
Tourism) by helping the Government prepare a development strategy for community-based
tourism that would promote broad-based local development, reduce administrative barriers to
tourism, and support the application o f preservation laws. In addition, I F C will explore
opportunities t o support development o f the tourism industry in Georgia.

70.

MIGA. MIGA has not yet provided a guarantee in Georgia, although it has received
expressions o f interest in the telecommunications and water sectors.

(20 Promoting Human Developmenf, Social Protection, and Protecting the Environment
71.
IDA assistance for human development and social protection i s aimed at improving the
use o f scarce public resources. With much health and education spending by default n o w in
private hands, public resources need to be focused o n improving access for the poor. This will
require, most crucially, increased overall expenditure, as w e l l as better prioritization o f sectoral
expenditures, including o f social protection programs, and qualitative improvements. Annual
process-based Public Expenditure Reviews will provide the underpinnings for needed systemic
changes in revenue and expenditure management, including improving the transparency and
equity o f transfers f r o m the central to the local budgets (which have an important role in
providing social services). In terms o f specific investment support, n o new projects in health and
education are envisioned, as implementation o f ongoing operations will extend beyond the
FY04-06 C A S period.
72.

Education. Over the C A S period, an important focus will be on implementation o f the

FYOl Education APL (second phase scheduled for early FY07), which aims at improving the
learning outcomes o f both boys and girls through curriculum reform, development o f an
examination system, training o f teachers, provision o f learning materials, and development o f
capacity t o make better use o f Georgia’s physical, financial and human resources. School
rationalization and consolidation will be undertaken t o ensure the most effective use o f the
limited resources available. While the investment needs o f school buildings are substantially
higher than what is currently affordable for Georgia, the MDF and SIF projects will continue t o
provide financing at the community level for critical social infrastructure needs, and for urgent
repairs t o school facilities in many communities.

Health. Building o n the reforms underway, and the first interventions in the sector
73.
(FY96 Health Project and FY02 Supplemental Credit), the F Y 0 3 Primary Health Care
Development Project i s continuing t o work with the Government o n improving the health care
financing system, exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a n e w system o f primary health
care (including an emphasis o n reducing maternal mortality), and improving the scope o f
services funded through public funds to increase focus o n the poor and priority public health

- 25 interventions. Given the increasing role o f private sector provision o f health services, an FY04
Health Note will provide a detailed assessment o f financing, production, management and
organization o f health services in Georgia.
74.
Social Protection. The second SIF project (co-financed with IDA, KfW and U S A I D ) is
focusing o n community development through rehabilitation o f small scale economic and social
infrastructure in poor rural and peri-urban communities. T o assist Georgia in further protecting
the most vulnerable, a variety o f instruments would be used, including the FY04 Social Protection Reform Project and an FYOd Poverty Assessment. The Social Protection Reform Project
would support Government’s efforts to improve administration, develop institutions and build
capacity for policy implementation in the areas o f social insurance, employment services and
labor market policies, social assistance, social services and child welfare. U N I C E F and S I D A
will support the child welfare component o f the project, and the Bank will prepare a Child
Welfare Note in FY04.
I n t e r n a l l y Displaced Persons. IDA has been collaborating with a range o f other donors
75.
in supporting the Georgia S e l f Reliance Fund (GSRF), which pilots innovative interventions t o
help create sustainable livelihoods for IDPs. The GSRF currently has a capital o f over $1 million, with contributions from IDA’S Self-Reliance Fund, UNHCR, UNDP, Switzerland, and
U S A I D . Approximately $500,000 has been disbursed t o date, and four pilot programs managed
by IDP communities, national and international NGOs, are currently under implementation.

The E n v i r o n m e n t and Natural Resources. IDA has supported preparation o f Georgia’s
76.
National Environmental Action Plan, Biodiversity Strategy, and the Black Sea Action Plan.
Ongoing projects (the F Y 9 9 Integrated Coastal Management Project and the GEF component o f
the FYOO Agriculture Research, Extension and Training Project) support environmental
protection and monitoring o n the coasts, and address point and non-point source pollution run off
into the Black Sea Basin. Efforts continue t o further protect coastal water quality and marine
life. The FYO1 Energy Transit Institution Building project i s increasing Government capacity
for environmental management o f o i l and gas transport.
Forestry. The FY03 Forestry Development Project (and related GEF-financed Protected
77.
Areas Project) aim t o improve forest management and sustainable use and conservation o f Georgia’s biodiversity. While better forest management has the potential to bring sizeable fiscal
benefits as well, reform o f the sector is likely to be high risk, given the entrenched political and
economic interests, including large amounts o f smuggled forest products. In order t o maintain
newly established protected areas, efforts needs t o be directed at increasing community involvement, boosting tourism, improving infrastructure, and implementing income generating activities
in buffer zones o f protected areas, where local communities face pressing subsistence needs. In
addition, I F C i s planning, subject to finding suitable partners support for development o f
community based forest management and reforestation initiatives along the B T C pipeline route.

@ioImproving Governance and Efficiency o fPubIic Expenditures
78.
The uncertain political environment in the 18 months between the November 2003
Parliamentary elections and the 2005 Presidential elections will make achieving governance
reform especially difficult. While the governance agenda i s broad, IDA will focus selectively o n

- 26 areas where progress seems possible in this setting: (i)
public expenditure management, where
there i s already a solid analytical base; (ii)
judicial reform; and (iii)
a more intensive dialogue on
c i v i l service reform, where there is a well-articulated reform plan. The Base Case envisages this
dialogue culminating in a Public Sector Reform Project in FY06, or in FY05 in the High Case if
the reform momentum accelerates.

79.

Public Sector Management. Preparation o f the Public Sector Reform project will, in
conjunction with a PHRD grant, help develop c i v i l service reform programs, with a focus on
functional analysis o f the central government and assessment o f appropriate levels o f
remuneration and employment, including consideration o f the social impact o f redundancies.
The project itself will aim t o strengthen public institutions, and society’s ability t o h o l d those
establish revenue predictinstitutions accountable. Specifically it will support measures to: (i)
reduce inequities across local government units; (iii)
improve incentives t o boost the
ability; (ii)
tax effort at the local level; (iv) clarify expenditure responsibilities by distributing
functions/competences between rayons and Local Self Governing Units; and (v) help strengthen
regulatory capacity, improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the public sector, and restructure
strategic sectors (energy, transport, telecom). Technical assistance provided by ongoing operations will become demand-based as Local S e l f Governing Units try t o meet performance criteria.
This will be closely coordinated with the ongoing Municipal Development and Social Investment
Funds, and with the proposed FY05 Rural Development Project.
Process-Based Public Expenditure Reviews. IDA will assist in strengthening the
80.
Government’s expenditure management systems through annual process-based public expenditure reviews t o be conducted in collaboration with the Government as a follow-up t o the FY03
PER. The reviews will focus o n strengthening the strategic content o f the budget formulation
process and raising the credibility o f the budget as a management tool through the proper
implementation o f the new Budget Systems Law. The Public Expenditure Review work would
be coupled with the F Y 0 6 Public Sector Management, and would underpin, in the High Case, an
F Y 0 6 PRSC (in the High Case the Public Sector Management Project would also be advanced to
FY05). The IMF and IDA will also continue to conduct Debt Sustainability Analyses, and I F C
and IDA will work with the government to ensure transparent reporting o f revenues during
implementation and operation o f the BTC pipeline. Assistance in the area o f intergovernmental
finance (in coordination with U SAID and the Urban Institute decentralization program) would
also be provided through the Public Sector Management Project.
Country Financial Accountability Assessment. A CFAA was carried out by IDA in
FY03, covering the whole public expenditure management framework, and analyzing the
fiduciary risks in the system o f internal controls. The assessment concluded that the fiduciary
risk of the Government’s current public expenditure management framework is high given
Georgia’s difficult governance situation, and requires strong internal and external controls. The
review’s major recommendations were for the Government t o focus, as a first priority, on:

81.

0

implementing a sound legal foundation for effective financial controls;

0

establishing an internal audit function;

0

strengthening the external audit function;

0

building staff capacity in financial management and auditing.

- 27 IDA will work with other donors to provide follow-up advice and support on these issues,
including through the proposed Public Sector Management Project.
Local Governments. Transparency and capacity building at the local level will, in addi82.
tion to support through projects such as the Social Investment Fund and Municipal Development
and Decentralization, be monitored through performance indicators by an independent organization funded through a competitive small grants program. Constructive competition between
local governments will be encouraged through a highly transparent and well-publicized budget
monitoring system. Indicators will be very similar to the financial eligibility conditions used by
the MDF in assessing the borrowing capacity.

83.
Support for Judicial Reform. According to the BEEPS, crime, corruption and the
judicial system are the worst culprits preventing private sector- and export-led growth. The
ongoing Judicial Reform Project has been helping to improve the quality and training o f judges,
as well as associated court infrastructure. The Public Sector Management Project would focus
on key measures to support and evaluate the impact o f the judicial reform, focus o n issues related
to access to justice, including the reform o f the Bar Association and support for the Anticorruption commission if political leadership on this issue i s forthcoming. Strong cooperation
with other donors and with civil society will be critical to the success o f the project. USAID,
UNDP, and DFID, amongst others, are providing substantial assistance in strengthening civil
society’s voice, including local community action and development programs, media training,
support to the elections process, and support to building and strengthening NGOs.
PRSC. In the event that Governance reform moves forward more quickly than currently
84.
expected, IDA would advance the Public Sector Reform Project to FY05, and plan for a f i r s t
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) in FY06. The PRSC would support implementation
o f selected Government priorities within the EDPRP, and the proceeds o f the credit would help
to meet Georgia’s substantial financing gaps and high debt service payments. If Georgia i s not
yet ready for a PRSC because o f insufficient progress o n expenditure tracking and fiduciary
arrangements, a programmatic adjustment instrument would be used instead.
Assistance Scenarios and Triggers

85.
The Base Case lending scenario during FY04-06 would be conditioned o n satisfactory
macroeconomic performance, specific and monitorable progress in governance (including fiscal
management), and continued good portfolio implementation (see Table 8). As discussed above,
the Base Case would support projects in public sector management (including judicial reform);
social protection; rural development and community-based tourism; priority infrastructure
investments (including roads, trade and transport facilitation, and rural telecommunications); and
facilitation o f the growth o f export-oriented small and medium-scale enterprises.

A High Case would provide additional resources (bringing total lending up t o $100 mil86.
l i o n in FY04-06) if the scope for strengthening governance improves significantly. The High
Case would include a first PRSC, or a programmatic adjustment credit, in FY06, and the Public
Sector Management Project would be brought forward t o FY05 to help lay the foundation for the
PRSC. Low Case lending i s envisaged if the governance environment, macroeconomic performance, or IDA portfolio implementation deteriorates markedly. The L o w Case would provide

- 28 around $45 million in selective support for key social sector, roads and rural development
projects that would have a development impact even in a more difficult implementation environment.

Non-Lending Support. IDA will strengthen i t s non-lending activities in the key areas
87.
outlined above, with a special focus on support for public expenditure reform through processbased reviews carried out jointly with the authorities and other stakeholders to improve public
sector management and the link with the EDPRP. Support for a better business environment will
be provided through financial sector advisory work and business environment and labor market
studies, as well as through IFC’s technical assistance program. Options for improving the
environment for rural development will be explored in a rural infrastructure study, and a water
resource and risk management study. Donor coordination and alignment with the Government’s
EDPRP priorities will be facilitated by periodic donor coordination meetings, and support for
PRSP updates. Finally, IDA’S flagship non-lending activity will be the preparation o f a major
Policy Options Report for discussion with the incoming government in early 2005.

88.

The IDA program i s built o n expectations o f continued improvements in macroeconomic and debt sustainability indicators. The projected improvements in debt sustainability
are particularly sensitive to a number o f macro-economic parameters including government and

export revenues, and non-debt creating capital inflows. IDA will closely monitor these
indicators. Should such review indicate worsening prospects for improved debt sustainability, a
progress report would be prepared and submitted to the Board, setting forth a recalibration o f
IDA'Sprogram necessary to ensure progress towards debt sustainability.

VI.

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS

Strategic Considerations
As elaborated in Section I11 above, IDA and I F C already have a broad ongoing program
o f support for the EDPRP objectives. In developing the FY04-06 CAS, several strategic choices
were made. First, particular attention will be paid to sustainable support for rural poverty
alleviation. Although urban poverty i s s t i l l higher in Georgia in absolute terms than rural, Table
4 shows an encouraging trend o f poverty reduction in urban areas, which have been more responsive to overall economic growth. Rural poverty, however, i s proving to be more intransigent,
and several o f the new operations for FY04-06 pay particular attention to stimulating economic
activity in rural areas in sustainable ways, including the Secondary and Local Roads, Rural
Development, and Community-Based Tourism projects. These initiatives will be complemented
by the Private Sector Development Project, which will focus on fostering productive clusters o f

Transport Facilitation and Rural Telecommunication projects, which will address important
logistical hindrances to rural economic development.
90.
Second, in addressing the needs o f the most vulnerable, the already very active ongoing
social sector programs will be complemented by a social protection project, addressing a central
theme o f the Bank’s C A S consultations (see paragraph 94 below). Third, the CAS is addressing
the governance problems that hinder sustainability, and which were another recurrent theme in
the consultations. While the Public Sector Management Project embeds crucial central
government reforms in terms o f budget preparation and execution, as well as judicial and t o the
extent possible c i v i l service reform, the project also aims at empowering local governments
through fiscal decentralization. Indeed, almost all projects in the ongoing and planned portfolio
have strong elements directly addressing fundamental governance problems through greater
transparency, accountability, and fostering o f community participation.

91.

Finally, bearing in mind both the political uncertainties during the next 18 months o n the
lessons learned from the previous CAS, the FY04-06 CAS program will rely relatively less o n
the central government and more o n financially self-sustaining autonomous institutions and
community-based efforts. Likewise, the program will rely more o n strengthening private sector
capacity and c i v i l society advocacy. An example is the already established GEOPRO publicprivate sector working group o n trade and transport facilitation, which anchored by a business
confederation-supported secretariat plays a leading role in regular dialogue and advocacy,
consultation o n legal and administrative issues, technical assistance, and monitoring o f
development impact. The planned projects will build further o n the success o f this model, and an
important strategic analytical contribution during FY05-06 will be the Policy Options Report for
the incoming government, which should also serve as a basis for the subsequent CAS.
Outcomes and Monitoring

92.
The proposed core indicators that would be used t o measure progress are shown in Table
9, and more specific performance indicators are shown in the Program M a t r i x (Annex 9). The
Program Matrix provides performance indicators for those elements o f the EDPRP that IDA i s
supporting through the C A S (other areas are either being supported by development partners, or
are o f relatively lower priority for Bank support given the areas o f C A S focus defined above).
IDA will also assist in developing monitoring procedures, and ensuring the indicators and the
results o f the performance assessments are publicly available throughout the country. IDA’S
own performance would also be evaluated based o n results o f regular client surveys and
consultations with the Government and with c i v i l society.

93.
The quarterly Household Survey will be a key element o f the measurement o f these
indicators. As donor finance for these surveys declines, the Government has committed t o a
corresponding increase in its o w n share o f the cost. The first test o f this commitment will come
with the 2004 budget. Resources will also be needed to improve the quality and the timely
dissemination o f the macro-economic and socio-demographic data provided by the State
Department for Statistics and the Ministry o f Finance.

94.
IDA’Sstrategy has been under discussion with a wide range o f stakeholders in Georgia
since the first draft o f the current CAS (in FYO1). Those discussions included c i v i l society focus
groups in four regions o f Georgia, NGOs, the foreign and domestic private sector, trade unions,
and major donors. Subsequently, IDA has participated actively in working groups and meetings
o n the EDPW with the authorities, other donors, the private sector and non-governmental
organizations, and those consultations are also reflected in the new CAS. Finally, views o n C A S
priorities were again discussed during meetings with donors, the private sector, N G O participants
in the EDPW process and the authorities at the time o f the Joint Portfolio Review in late January
2003. The themes identified below have recurred throughout these various discussions and
consultations.

Social Conditions. Poverty was seen as being very widespread, and worse in urban
areas, but there was a recognition that absolute poverty in the countryside i s s t i l l a
serious problem. Deteriorating standards o f health care were frequently mentioned as a
major element o f the decline in social conditions in Georgia. Pension arrears were
another concern, and many participants said it was essential that the limited funds
available for social protection be targeted t o the most needy, and that this in turn
required more accurate identification o f the most vulnerable. M a n y focus groups
referred t o the cultural deprivation they felt, with many people no longer being able to
afford newspapers or books, and with the sense that many children are n o longer
receiving a good education.
Governance. Most focus groups sharply criticized the corruption and inefficiency o f
Government agencies, and their lack o f accountability. The view was that little i s done
t o prosecute corrupt officials, and much productive energy i s wasted dealing with petty
harassment. Small businesses in particular spend enormous amounts o f time and money
dealing with corrupt officials. At the same time large businesses with powerful friends
were seen to break the l a w with some impunity, and Government officials w h o broke
the l a w were usually at worst moved t o different posts. In reaction to these failings
many participants wanted to see a more active N G O sector providing an alternative
source o f services and advice. There was also a request for more outreach and
transparency o n the part o f IDA and other donors in acknowledging these issues and
pressing for reform.
Enterprise Development. Participants stressed that many o f the sectors that flourished
in Soviet times - heavy industries and textiles in particular - are n o longer competitive.
But many saw potential in newer sectors such as agro-processing for export. The m a i n
constraints t o faster development o f these emerging sectors were seen t o be red tape,
corruption and lack o f market knowledge and entrepreneurial experience. Other
obstacles often mentioned were poor access t o credit, high interest rates, and inadequate
skills and training. Some participants saw greater potential for j o b creation in rural
areas, more so than in towns with dying heavy industries.

- 34 Development Partners

95.

Donor coordination has been good in Georgia, and has improved further with the
establishment o f the “Framework Group” which coordinates all donor EDPRP activities. All
requests for support for the EDPRP have been channeled through the Framework Group,
coordinated by UNDP, which has collectively reviewed each proposal before passing it o n t o
individual donors for possible support. This arrangement has substantial advantages for both
Government and donors, since it has streamlined communications, reduced overlap between
donor programs, and has allowed a broader review o f Government proposals. (Areas o f
emphasis o f donors are detailed below and in Attachment 11).

96.
UNDP in Georgia focuses its program activities in three areas: (a) democratic
governance; (b) poverty reduction; and (c) environmental protection, as outlined in the second
Country Cooperation Framework for Georgia (2001-2005). In the sphere o f Govemance, major
ongoing initiatives include support to the Foreign Investment Advisory Council, strengthening
the Anti-corruption Promotion Group, and assistance t o the Constitutional Court and Public
Defender’s Office. U N D P has been active in capacity building o f the Georgian International O i l
Corporation and o f the National Security Policy Management. UNDP i s also contributing to land
market development through creation o f a computerized program o f registration. Technical and
financial inputs have been provided t o strengthen the capacity o f Georgian institutions
responsible for national statistics, notably the State Department o f Statistics. Environmental
challenges are being addressed through projects supporting recovery, conversation and
sustainable use o f Georgia’s agro-biodiversity, removal o f barriers t o small hydro power sector
development, and capacity building o f the Ministry o f Environment.

97.
UNICEF priorities in Georgia include: education, integrated childhood development,
immunization, fighting HIV/AIDS, and protecting children from violence, exploitation, abuse
and discrimination. I t has been assisting the Government in national training o f health workers
and professionals and in providing universal access t o basic health services for women and
children. U N I C E F has been helping the Government in promoting the implementation o f the
Convention o n the Rights o f the Child. Support also includes ensuring inclusive education for
children with disabilities, and providing psychosocial support to children in need o f special
protection, as w e l l as introducing alternative, non-institutional methods o f childcare. Child deinstitutionalization has been also supported by SIDA through provision o f technical assistance
during social protection reform project preparation and implementation phases.
98.
EBRD’s main objective in Georgia i s t o expand private sector development activities.
During 2002 and 2003 it has been engaged in an active political dialogue with the Government to
support substantial reduction o f administrative barriers t o investments, representation o n the
board o f companies and banks, support o f the initiatives o f local business associations. EBRD
aims at further strengthening o f the Georgian banking sector through ongoing support t o the
regulator, management training, and further consolidation. EBRD’s interventions include financing for business start-ups and existing micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as
selectively supporting critical investments in infrastructure with specific focus o n those projects
that promote the commercialization o f infrastructure, particularly o f the energy sector.

- 35 99.
USAID assistance in the economic growth area focuses o n strengthening agriculture sector, assisting the NBG t o improve i t s supervision, inspection, and enforcement capacity, and
furthering land market reform. The Georgian Enterprise Growth Initiative (GEGI) i s a major
new private sector development activity to be implemented in close coordination with the C A S
programs. U SAID has been actively involved in the energy and environmental sectors providing
TA to regulatory bodies, supporting privatization o f the energy sector and improvement o f the
international investment climate, assisting in elaboration o f environmentally sound laws in the
energy sector, as well as policies in the sector oriented towards energy efficiency, conservation
and water management. Through democracy and governance oriented projects U S A I D supports
increased awareness o f legal rights, judicial and bar reform initiatives, strengthening local governments, building professionalism o f independent mass media as well as capacity o f c i v i l society and NGOs. U S A I D initiatives in the social sectors include programs in the regions t o support
income generation and economic self-reliance activities among internally displaced persons,
crisis assistance t o the most vulnerable, health care partnership programs, and reproductive
health programs which promote improved maternal and perinatal services, safe motherhood,
family planning, health information systems, and STI/HIV awareness and prevention.
100. EU’s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) provides for cooperation in a wide
range o f areas including the Food Security Program, rehabilitation in conflict zones (Engury
Power Plan in Abkhazia), macro-financial assistance (establishment o f an agricultural credit
institutions, reforms in accountancy and audit, assistance to the insurance sector and securities
market regulation), support t o trade liberalization, customs, and development o f transport
infrastructure networks, advice o n economic legislation and country legislature harmonization
with EU standards, investments in the primary health care reconstruction program, development
of the Georgian National Health Program, and training o f medical and administrative personnel,
as well as provision o f technical assistance for the development o f the model o f Regional Health
financing. TACIS i s the main financial instrument supporting the implementation o f the PCA.

101. The Netherlands has provided support for a wide range o f activities, focusing o n good
governance, economic reforms, human rights and peace building, as w e l l as substantial budget
assistance as support for the structural reforms under SAC 111. Dutch support in these focus
areas will continue, including for election preparation, prevention o f trafficking in human beings,
confidence building measures in Abkhazia, and support for N G O s involved in poverty
alleviation and human rights.

102. GTZ, working o n behalf o f German Government, provides support in the health sector
primarily focusing o n structural improvements and training for medical technicians, promoting
the vocational training sector t o improve commercial and agricultural training and upgrading,
implementing projects to privatize agriculture and build up effective land- and debt-management
systems, promotes export and investment, and has been assisting in judicial and legal training as
well as practical application o f c i v i l l a w in Georgia. German assistance is also channeled
through KfW, which is supporting credit lines to agriculture sector enterprises, with participation
through an equity stake in Procredit Bank. KFW is conducting cadastral works over almost the
whole country, and contributing to social infrastructure in the districts bordering BorjomiKharagauli National Park, as well as supporting Government efforts to rehabilitate schools and
health facilities damaged during the recent earthquake.

-36103. Bilateral assistance from Canada (CIDA) comes mostly through the regional projects
supporting trade policy capacity, expanding the micro credit programs, promoting NGO capacity
development program that supports the principles o f good governance, strengthening health
reform through the appropriate application o f health information technology and information
management strategies, and contributing drought victims relief operations. C I D A is also
supporting the Georgia Business Development Project, a five-year technical assistance program
implemented by the Private Enterprise Partnership.
104. DFID has recently approved a new Primary Health Care (PHC) Development project
through which technical assistance will be provided t o the Government in the areas o f human
resource development for the P H C system, health care financing, health management
information systems, capacity building for the health policy development. DFID has been
supporting the SDS in the multi-sector household and labor market surveys. The ongoing
program also has a component aiming at development o f good governance and c i v i l society in
two regions o f Georgia as well as conflict reduction and confidence building component.

105. In the agriculture sector IFAD supports rural development program for mountainous and
highland areas and credit-union development and rural credit activities for small farmers, while
F A 0 provides financial support to hazelnut rehabilitation.

There are five categories o f risks t o the strategy outlined above.

Governance. As mentioned above, the next 18 months encompasses a rather uncertain
political period in Georgia, with heavily contested parliamentary and Presidential
elections. O n the other hand, improvement in governance i s crucial for Georgia's growth
and poverty reduction strategy t o succeed. These issues therefore have acquired a central
place in IDA'Sdevelopment dialogue with Georgia and are reflected in the C A S triggers.
M a n y o f the CAS interventions also directly address the challenges o f improving public
sector efficiency and accountability; strengthening public expenditure management;
improving regulatory arrangements and other factors affecting the business environment;
modernizing the judiciary; and building capacity o f communities, local governments and
other stakeholders t o participate in decision-making and press for accountability in the
use o f public resources.
Fiscal and Debt Vulnerability. A renewed weakening o f fiscal performance i s also a
serious risk. Without an improvement in revenue collection and development o f a
program that will allow Georgia t o return to the Paris Club, the country will face a heavy
debt burden over the medium term, and an increased inability t o provide basic social
services. This would lead to a further deterioration in human capital, undermining growth
and poverty alleviation. The IMF i s providing intensive advice to Georgia o n fiscal
policy; IMF and IDA are cooperating o n Debt Sustainability Analysis; and IDA and other
partners have offered, or are providing, assistance o n budget management and reform o f
tax and customs administration, including through the annual Public Expenditure
Reviews.

Conflict. Georgia remains vulnerable to both internal and external conflicts. Any renewal o f domestic conflict would seriously limit the Government’s ability to implement
the EDPRP. Similarly, enhanced regional cooperation will be an important factor i f
Georgia i s to maximize its potential as a transit economy, and t o strengthen foreign
investment, tourism and trade. The CAS aims at mitigating these risks by targeted
programs to increase the living standards o f the poor in general, and programs to
strengthen commercial interaction between rural and urban areas and across regions in
particular. In addition, IDA has been conducting analytical work and supporting technical exchanges o n common issues among the South Caucasus countries. Finally, IDA
stands ready to provide assistance if geo-political solutions to the Abkhazia and South
Ossetia conflicts are reached.
V u l n e r a b i l i t y to Exogenous Shocks. A s demonstrated by the droughts in 1998 and
2000 (with severe impacts o n both agriculture and hydropower availability), and by the
Russia financial crisis, Georgia is, and will remain, vulnerable to external shocks. C A S
interventions promoting energy sector development, irrigation, rural development and
diversification o f Georgia’s trade patterns should help lessen the country’s vulnerability
to these shocks over the medium term.
Political Uncertainties. The period up t o the Presidential elections in April 2005 i s
likely to be one o f considerable political uncertainty, with the direction o f reform before
and after the elections being difficult to predict. IDA will engage in a broad dialogue
with all stakeholders during this period, and will work closely with other donors and
national stakeholders to support the EDPRP consultation process in a continuing effort to
build consensus o n the country’s main development challenges and strategies to address
them. Finally, a CAS Progress Report will be presented t o the Board after the Presidential elections if there has been sufficient change that circumstances warrant a review o f
the assistance strategy.

Partnership in Georgia ’s Development Strategy

1.
The IMF has taken the lead in assisting Georgia in enhancing macroeconomic stability. In
this regard, the Fund has encouraged the authorities to pursue a prudent fiscal policy, including
by increasing tax revenues and reducing domestic expenditure arrears. The IMF Board approved
a new three-year program under the Fund’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) in
January 2001. The first and the second reviews under the PRGF were completed in October
200 1 and July 2002, respectively. Implementation o f the 2002 macroeconomic program was
broadly o n track. Quantitative criteria and indicative targets were met, except for those o n
domestic arrears, fuel and excise tax collection and reserve money. At 2 percent o f GDP, the
fiscal deficit was slightly higher than programmed because o f shortfalls in extemal financing,
and revenue collection improved only slightly f r o m 14.3 percent o f GDP t o 14.4 percent over the
period. An IMF mission which visited Georgia in July 2003 t o discuss completion o f the
postponed third review found that the fiscal pressures that emerged in early 2003 had continued,
with tax revenue falling short o f budget targets, and an accumulation o f substantial new budget
arrears. The IMF thus saw the need inter alia t o introduce some tax reform measures, adjust
electricity tariffs and revise the 2003 budget to close the fiscal gap. The authorities achieved the
first two, but were unable to secure parliamentary approval o f a revised budget. The current
PRGF will expire in the next several months, and the IMF will soon be initiating discussions to
assess prospects for a possible new three-year program t o support Georgia’s EDPRP.
2.
IDA has taken the lead in the policy dialogue o n structural issues, focusing on: (i)
strengthening public expenditure management; (ii)deepening and diversifying sources of
growth, (iii)protecting the environment; and (iv) reducing poverty. The table o n page 40
summarizes the division o f responsibility between the t w o institutions. In a number o f areas for example the social sectors, rural development, environment, and infrastructure - IDA takes
the lead in the dialogue and there i s n o cross conditionality with the IMF-supported program.
IDA i s also leading the dialogue o n private sector reform, and IDA analysis serves as inputs into
the Fund program. In other areas - energy, the financial sector, public expenditure management,
and revenue and customs - both institutions work together. Finally, in areas l i k e monetary
policy the IMF takes the lead with little IDA involvement.
Areas in which IDA leads and there is no direct IMF involvement

Areas in which IDA leads and there is n o direct IMF involvement include the social
3.
sectors, infrastructure and environment.
0

In the social sectors IDA conducts annual updates o f Georgia’s Poverty Assessment based
o n household data collected o n a quarterly basis. IDA’S focus has been t o improve the
budget execution o f expenditures for health, education and poverty benefits and t o raise the
efficiency in the use o f scarce public resources. Through the Social Investment Fund
credits, IDA i s focusing in particular o n areas with high poverty levels to provide basic
infrastructure to the poorest communities. A Self-reliance Fund Grant will help authorities
address the complex issues related to internally displaced people. IDA i s also supporting a

-39dialogue with the Govemment o n social protection reform that will lead to an IDAsupported project.
In education the Education Adaptable Program Credit aims at improving the leaming outcomes o f primary and secondary students, through curriculum reform, development o f an
examination system, training o f teachers, provision o f leaming materials, and development
o f capacity to make better use o f Georgia’s physical, financial and human resources. While
the investment needs o f school buildings are substantially higher than i s currently
affordable for Georgia, the Social Investment Fund projects continue t o assist in financing
urgent repairs to school facilities in many communities.
In health, IDA Credits to support the Government in improving the health care financing
system, exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a new system o f primary health care
and improving the focus o f services funded through public funds o n the poor and o n
priority public health interventions. In addition SAC 3 and the Structural Reform Support
Credit have supported hospital restructuring.
In infrastructure support is being provided through the Municipal Development and
Decentralization Credit and the Social Investment Fund Credit. These projects are
providing financing at the community level for critical infrastructure needs, primarily for
school and health facilities heating and repair, small hydropower schemes t o provide
electricity, drinking water and sanitation rehabilitation, as w e l l as transportation
infrastructure rehabilitation.
In r u r a l development IDA credits have supported the development o f private sector
farming and agro-processing improvements, agricultural credit, irrigation and drainage, and
agriculture research and extension. IDA has also been supporting the creation o f local
institutions such as rural credit unions and water users associations through its Credits.

Areas in which I D A leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMFprogram

IDA has been leading the dialogue o n structural reforms through S A C 3, approved by
IDA’s Board o f Executive Directors in June 1999, and closed in October, 2002. Despite
considerable delays, the core conditions o f S A C 3 were met, but poor governance reduced their
impact. Institution building and technical assistance has been supported through the Structural
Reform Support Credit, also approved by I D A ’ s Board o f Executive Directors o n June 29, 1999.
IDA also leads in the areas of:
4.

Private sector development. S A C 3 supported improvements in the environment for
private sector development, focusing on: (i)simpler licensing regulations; (ii)more
transparent government procurement; (iii)
reduced cost o f entry for businesses; and (iv)
privatization o f state-owned commercial assets. IDA has also been supporting private
sector participation in other areas such as energy, telecommunications, urban services and
agriculture. The IMF has worked with the authorities t o initiate audits o f the 2002
accounts o f three major state owned enterprises.

- 40 0

Energy. The energy system i s in poor condition, with unreliable supply, massive nonpayment and mounting debts. IDA has been working with other donors, including the
IMF, to encourage more private management and ownership, and to implement a series o f
short-term action plans to improve the overall functioning o f the sector. The IMF has also
been focusing on improved payments for electricity.

111: CORE LABOR
STANDARDS IN GEORGIA
1.
Forced Labor. The Constitution prohibits forced or bonded labor, including by children,
and provides for sanctions against violators.
2.
Trafficking in Persons. The l a w does not prohibit trafficking in persons specifically,
although trafficking could be prosecuted under laws prohibiting slavery, forced labor, illegal
detention, and fraud. Georgia i s both a source and a transit country for trafficked persons. There
have been unconfirmed reports that government customs and border officials were involved in
the trafficking o f persons. The Government has prosecuted some traffickers using fraud statutes,
but otherwise has n o active programs to address the problem o f trafficking. A government
program for combating violence against women included a proposal for measures to eliminate
trafficking in women for the purpose o f sexual exploitation; however, it has not been
implemented due to budgetary constraints. Georgia itself i s generally not a destination place for
trafficked persons.

3.
Effective Abolition of Child Labor. According t o the law, the minimum age for
employment o f children i s 16 years; however, in exceptional cases, the minimum age can be 14
years. The Ministry o f Health, Social Service, and Labor enforces these laws and generally they
are respected. The Government has not ratified the ILO Convention 182 o n the worst forms o f
child labor.
Elimination o f Discrimination in Employment. The Constitution provides for the
4.
equality o f m e n and women. Women's access t o the labor market has improved but remained
primarily confined, particularly for older women, to low-paying and low-skilled positions, often
without regard t o high professional and academic qualifications. Salaries for women continued
to lag behind those o f men. Reportedly men were given preference in promotions. O f the
114,5 12 registered unemployed persons throughout the country, 46 percent were women.
Women sometimes, but not often, filled leadership positions. According t o UNDP, employers
frequently withheld benefits connected t o pregnancy and childbirth.

5.

Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining. The l a w prohibits
discrimination by employers against union members, and employers may be prosecuted for
antiunion discrimination and forced to reinstate employees and pay back wages; however, there
are reports o f managements warning staff not t o organize trade unions. Some workers, including
teachers in the Imereti region, employees o f various mining, winemaking, pipeline, and port
facilities, and the Tbilisi municipal government reportedly complain o f being intimidated or
threatened by employers for union organizing activity. Observers also claimed that employers
failed t o transfer compulsory union dues, deducted f r o m wages, t o union bank accounts. The
Ministry o f Labor has investigated some complaints, but n o action has been taken against any
employers to date. There are no legal prohibitions against affiliation and participation in
international organizations. The Constitution and the law allow workers t o organize and bargain
collectively, and some workers exercise this right; however, the practice o f collective bargaining
is not widespread.
