EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i. Today, Nepal stands at the crossroads
between a brighter future that promises
more sustained poverty reduction and the
possibility of the country becoming mired in
a more protracted internal conflict. During
the past few years, the insurgency has
escalated sharply, involving an open conflict
with the army since November 2001. This,
combined with external developments, has
undermined the economy and weakened the
country's fiscal position. Despite the many
positive changes Nepal has seen since the
advent of multi-party democracy in 1990
and the first wave of economic liberalization
measures in the early-1ggos, the recent
developments have highlighted the stark
and worsening inequities in Nepal, not only
in terms of incomes, but also of the fundamental ability of the Nepali citizen to
participate in social and political decisionmaking processes. The deepening crisis,
however, has also created the space for the
reform-minded political and technocratic
leaders to begin a renewed drive to build an
economic and social foundation for sustained
peace and poverty reduction.
ii. Important reforms have emerged in
several areas over the past two years. First,
to prevent a possible financial sector crisis, a
key initial step was taken by putting the two
ailing commercial banks under external
management teams. Second, facing up
squarely to the fiscal pressures, His Majesty's
Government of Nepal (HMGN) introduced a
Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF) in FYo2/03 to rationalize the
development budget and instill the discipline
of a hard budget constraint. Third, responding to the urgent need to improve public
service delivery, HMGN has started to
transfer key services to community management in primary education and primary
health care. Fourth, to ensure implementation of priority reforms, HMGN devised an
Immediate Action Plan (IAP) in 2002, which
was effectively used to hold relevant Ministries and Departments accountable for
promised actions. Fifth, a highly visible

anti-corruption drive has been started by the
Commission for Investigation of Abuse of
Authority (CIAA), thereby giving Nepali
citizens a hope that the days of rampant
corruption may be coming to an end. The
recently adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS)-based on the Tenth Plan (FYo2/03FYo6/o7)-builds on these successes, and
gives the reform process much greater
strategic coherence and clarity.
iii. Nepal's PRS breaks from the past, largely
ineffective plans in a number of significant
ways. For the first time, it explicitly identifies social exclusion as one of the fundamental development challenges. It also recognizes HMGN's constrained fiscal situation
and weak implementation capacity, and
places the PRS in a realistic framework of
implementation abilities, both fiscal and
institutional. Thus, the MTEF gives it both a
medium term fiscal framework and annual
budgetary translation of the strategy, while
the IAP will be used as an annual implementation plan for high priority reform actions
that would receive continual attention from
the highest levels of HMGN. These two
instruments and the track record of significant early progress give the PRS considerable
credibility. With the aim of reducing
poverty and improving critical public
services, the PRS is built around four pillars:
(i) broad-based economic growth; (ii) social
sector development; (iii) social inclusion; and
(iv) good governance. In implementing it,
the PRS stresses decentralization, rationalization of central government functions and
transparency.
iv. Despite the successes and a palpable
change in the energy with which the reform
leaders are pushing the agenda at the center,
the benefits of the reforms have not yet been
felt widely at the grassroots levels. There is
clearly a need to accelerate the reform
actions embodied in the PRS, including in
particular greater decentralization. This
would be essential not only for rebuilding the
people's confidence in the state, but also for

v. Given the continuing political turmoil,
the Bank no doubt faces a risky environment
in which to operate in Nepal. The Bank,
however, should not lose sight of the most
important risk the country faces, and hence
by extension the Bank also faces-i.e., the
risk of Nepal spiraling into a widespread
armed conflict and a breakdown of state
institutions. In comparison, many of the
other risks are modest if not trivial. The
current wave of reforms is a determined
effort by the reform leaders to mitigate this
fundamental risk. Unlike in typical reform
episodes, the leadership for change has come
more from a growing number of reformminded technocrats and some enlightened
political leaders who stand apart in an
establishment that has provided largely
passive support rather than explicit leadership. Because of this, the reform efforts may
seem more tenuous and less spectacular.
Nevertheless, the basic contents of the
reform program enjoys strong support from
the population at large and at least tacit
support from mainstream political parties.
This is not to minimize the risks that the
reform process could be stifled by myopic
political interests or the implementation
capacity is curtailed by hostilities. Implementation of the Bank's strategy will be
cognizant of these risks.

vi. Through the lean years of slow reforms,
the Bank worked consistently with reformminded leaders and facilitated the beginnings of the current reform process. The
firm linking of lending levels to actual
reform implementation has challenged and
inspired the reformers. And, an uncommonly strong partnership has developed
between these leaders and the Bank, with a
strongly shared vision for the reforms that
Nepal needs. More importantly, the reformers have risen to the occasion and have
begun implementing the far reaching
program articulated in the PRS. Because of
the fiscal pressures, accelerating its implementation will require increased external
resource flows, particularly of a programmatic nature. The Bank's CAS for FY04FY07 is designed to respond to this situation

by increasing financial support to facilitate
Nepal's own reform efforts. To align the
Bank's assistance program with the PRS, the
CAS will be fully outcomes-focused, continuing the outcomes-based approach developed
by the Nepal Country Team over the last two
years.
vii. Given the risks of politics getting in the
way of reforms, the Bank will continue to
maintain sharply differentiated lending
levels linked to progress on reform implementation. The base case envisions an
average annual lending of about US$19o
million (consistent with the current IDA
resource allocation for Nepal), including
programmatic support to facilitate accelerated implementation of the core PRS priorities. If the reform process stalls (low case),
the lending support will be curtailed sharply
to a range of US$o-5o million. In the high
case-which is associated with peace and
accelerated reforms-lending could increase
to US$200-25o million annually. With the
prevailing uncertainties, however, there
could be a need to revisit the strategy. As
such, a CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) will be
prepared in approximately eighteen to
twenty-four months, or sooner should the
situation warrant.
viii. The Executive Directors may wish to
discuss:
* The appropriateness of the basic strategy
of providing strong support to Nepal's PRS
in the face of significant political uncertainty;
* The appropriateness of the outcomes-based
approach outlined in the CAS; and
* The choice of instruments to deliver the
lending program.
ix. In many respects, Nepal is truly at a
critical juncture in its development process,
and it is difficult to predict which path the
country will follow. While the on-going
reforms offer the best hope for laying the
foundation for sustained peace and development, the insurgency makes their implementation more difficult. Yet, one thing is clear.
With strong support of the Bank as outlined in
this CAS, the chances are much greater that
the reform program will succeed, and hence,
lead eventually to real improvements in the
lives of Nepal's poor and most vulnerable.

There is evidence that the net enrolment rate of primary-aged

There have been significant improvements in the relative

of girls to boys in primary/secondary education of 82%);
however, the ratio of young literate females to males is still
less than 60%, and Nepali women are still largely without

Within the last decade, there have been considerable
reductions in infant mortality (from 100 per 1,000 live births to

nevertheless, large regional variations persist.

Reduce maternal mortality ratios by threequarters between 1990 and 2015.

Maternal mortality remains high (estimated at 830 per 100,000
live births in 1995) with only about 12% of births attended by
skilled health staff.

and social reforms. In this context, securing a
lasting peace with the insurgents, reaching a
political settlement with the parties and
building an environment conducive to holding
elections all remain high on HMGN's agenda.

More recently, there have been signs of a
modest recovery underway, with GDP
growing by 2.3% in FYo2/o3. Economic
activity picked up noticeably after the
January cease-fire with some recovery in
tourism, transportation and other services,
and certain manufactured exportsespecially garments. Nevertheless, the
economy remains weak.

As imports have also somewhat
rebounded, the current account balance
recorded a slight deficit (about 1% of GDP)
in FYo2/o3. Remittances from Nepalese
working abroad have grown tremendously
(estimated at around US$855 million in
FYo2/03), with this item now larger than
the value of merchandise exports. Gross

The most recent estimates are based on the 1995/96 Household Survey. A Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) was launched in
early-2003 to update household level information on consumption, poverty and their determinants. A full Poverty Report based on this
survey will be finalized in FY05. For more details on the poverty situation in Nepal, see the Poverty Reduction Strategy.
All poverty figures cited are based on the results of the 1995/96 Household Survey and can be compared to an overall poverty incidence
estimated at 42% of the population.
Nepal has over 100 languages and dialects, and more than 60 recorded ethnic groups, some of which are further sub-divided into distinct
caste rankings. There are many indigenous ethnic ('Janajati') groups and 12-15% of the population are 'Dalits' or occupational caste
groups who have been historically disadvantaged and continue to lag behind.
See paragraphs 21-23 for details on the implementation of the MTEF and fiscal adjustments.
Nevertheless, a key concern will be the removal of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) based quota protected markets that had stimulated
the growth of manufacturing and trading over the last decade.
For a more detailed discussion of the experience with implementing the last CAS, see Appendix II.

Framework and Fiscal Adjustments

22

Based on the recommendations of the

2000

Public Expenditure Review (PER)12 and

the work of the Public Expenditure Review
Commission (PERC) in 2001, and prompted
by the worsening fiscal situation, HMGN
decided to introduce an MTEF starting in
FYo2/03. Overcoming the entrenched
tendency to seek increased foreign aid to cope
with fiscal stress, the reform-minded
National Planning Commission (NPC) and
Ministry of Finance (MOF) used the fiscal
pressures to motivate serious adjustments in
budget allocations. This led to elimination of
16o low priority projects (out of 625
projects) in the FYo2/03 budget. Further
cuts in projects would have been desirable,
but were politically impossible. Instead,
HMGN chose to be pragmatic and opted for
an unorthodox solution in which remaining
projects were classified into three prioritiesP1, P2, and P3. While funding for the top

in FYo2/03. While in principle this increase
was detrimental to the development efforts,
NPC/MOF turned it to its advantage. As the
increase in security spending was an absolute
imperative, the resulting severe fiscal
pressure made it easier to impose a hard
budget constraint on line ministries and
politicians who had been accustomed to much
softer budget constraints in the past. The
majority of the cuts hit low priority,
politically motivated projects. Total
development spending declined from Rs. 37
billion in FYoo/oi to Rs. 27 billion in FY02/
03. The developmental impact of this
reduction appears to have been relatively
modest, as most of the dropped and P3 projects
had been ill conceived to begin with and
receiving only modest annual funding
without any realistic hope of completion in
the foreseeable future.

In the meantime, through reforms to

In FYo3/o4, further measures are

greater participation of the private sector in
infrastructure services-e.g., establishment of
the Power Development Fund (PDF) to
promote private investment, introduction of
a rural telecommunications operator and
opening the licensing system for private
cellular operators. In effect, HMGN has been
able to turn the fiscal and service quality
crises into an opportunity to establish a leaner
and more efficient public spending program.
As Nepal begins to implement its PRS in full
scale and increase expenditures to support it,
far greater impact from additional spending
can be expected than in the past.

the population (from 72%), access to

these objectives, the PRS is formulated

A strong public sector institution
requires: (i) sound institutional set-up; (ii)
'enabling environment' for the institutionespecially a system that shields the
institution from undue political interference
and rewards professional performance; (iii)
good people-which requires a performanceoriented and financially decent incentive
system as well as training; and (iv)
experience. In Nepal, development partners
have tended mainly to focus on institutional
set-up and training people, without paying
sufficient attention to the other aspects or
finding effective ways to get at them.
Improving the 'enabling environment' and
creating a performance-oriented incentive
system are inherently political processes,
and donors can only encourage indigenous
efforts. Thus, donor support needs to be
somewhat opportunistic. An important
dimension that has tended to be neglected by
donors is helping the institutions to build
experience. If anything, by substituting for
HMGN's own work, development partners
may have tended to hamper the ability of

that capacity building is more about
creating space for the Nepalis to think for
themselves and act on their own, and
providing knowledge only where it is
specifically demanded.27 Money is seldom
the real constraint to capacity building in
Nepal. Based on this perspective, the Bank's
efforts will focus on:
* Facilitating country-led changes, as in the
end this is what capacity building is
about. The primary concentration will be
on helping HMGN build its own policy
formulation and implementation capacity
at the central level through experience.
This effort depends critically on the ability
of the country-based staff-especially

Nepali staff-to engage and motivate
HMGN counterparts in reform thinking,
backed by the ability to bring in global
knowledge from the rest of the Bank and/
or internationally as needed. While this
concept of decentralization is already
working well, further efforts will be made,
especially to strengthen the capacity of
the country-based staff; and
* Where there are legitimate needs for more
traditional TA and training that arise
from the Nepal-led and Bank-supported
reform efforts, the Bank will continue to
be prepared to provide such assistance
through a variety of means. Since all
IDA-funded projects involve important
reform elements, almost all include TA
and/or training components. To maximize their impact, however, the Bank
relies heavily on identification of needs by
the reform leaders themselves. In some
areas-such as public expenditure management, monitoring and evaluation in
conjunction with PRS implementation,
and improving financial accountability
systems-TA and training of central
importance will be supported by IDF
grants and direct TA.

Instruments to Achieve the CAS Outcomes

58

A critical element for achieving the

CAS outcomes is an internal alignment of the
work program with the outcomes. The
formulation of the annual work program is
used as an important process to develop a
consensus on the annual milestones toward
achieving the longer term CAS outcomes,
and the broad strategy and specific
instruments to reach those milestones. This
has helped to develop organic integration of a
range of AAA instruments (e.g., formal
reports, informal policy notes, TA, seminars,
policy dialogue, strategic communication)
and lending instruments. It has also enabled
much more effective cross-sectoral efforts
directed toward the shared outcomes. This
process, combined with regular monitoring

of progress from the outcomes perspective, is

In relation to many outcomes, AAA
will continue to play an important role and
will be used more consciously to overcome
specific obstacles to reforms. During the past
four years, while the lending program
remained in the low case and the work
program focused on motivating reforms, the
Bank learned to use AAA more strategically
for engaging Nepali authorities in policy
dialogue and has been effective in evoking
change. The shift by the Bank toward an
outcomes-focused approach also changed the
nature of AAA. From the outset, each AAA
piece is conceived as part of a strategy to help
facilitate some specific development
outcome. This has led to two important
changes: (i) unlike in the past, dissemination
of AAA outputs is no longer an afterthought,
but is an integral part of the motivation for
the AAA task itself; and (ii) there is much
greater use of small, informal, and targeted
reports that are designed to help the reform
leaders in Nepal themselves rather than
bulky reports whose target audience is often
unclear. Under this CAS, these trends will
continue. In addition to supporting the
MTEF, IAP and overall structural reform
efforts, dialogue and TA will continue to be
used widely to help achieve the CAS
outcomes, including in power, higher
education, fiscal decentralization, civil
service reform and special interest issues
such as child labor and trafficking.

60

Going forward, formal AAA will
continue to help lay a foundation for
building the agenda and needed consensus
for reform (see Table 4). Contributing to the
completion of all core diagnostic pieces-8 and
helping to prioritize future policy reform
areas, a Development Policy Review (DPR) is
envisioned for FY04, along with key studies
on agriculture, labor remittances, and a

social and gender assessment. Also during
the CAS period, important work will be
undertaken analyzing the impacts of the
financial sector reforms and providing an
update of the child labor situation,29 as well
as continuous public expenditure analysis.

61

The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
will both play important-albeit relatively
limited-roles in the implementation of the
strategy. IFC will continue to support
export-oriented manufacturing, private
investment in telecommunications and
power generation and distribution, financial
market development, and the growth of
small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due
to the still weak security situation and
political uncertainties, currently there are
few investment opportunities in Nepal large
enough for direct financing, so IFC does not
expect to make many new investments
during the CAS period. Instead, IFC will

case lending program represents a
significant increase in the level of IDA
lending to Nepal (the base case was US$70120 million under the 1998 CAS), this
should not pose any debt service difficulties.

the public debt service to GDP ratio stands at
a modest 1.6% and external debt servicing is
only about 7.5% of exports of goods and nonfactor services.35

In a low case scenario, the lending
volume would be significantly less than in a

per year. The nature of IDA assistance in the

nature of the additional support in a high

interventions related to 'nation re-building'
activities, but it is difficult to be very specific
about such interventions at this time, as
they must emerge from the peace process
itself. With the prevailing uncertainties,
there may be a need to revisit the assistance
strategy in eighteen to twenty-four months
or even sooner. As such, a CAS PR will be
prepared at least by early-FYo6 or as the
situation warrants.

Despite the noted improvements, the

portfolio remains at risk and could be
adversely affected by a resumption of
insurgent activities or a period of protracted
political instability. To mitigate the risks,
the Bank-primarily through the staff in the
country office-has been proactively
supporting and monitoring project
implementation. In this effort, the Bank,
together with HMGN, ADB and the Japan
Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)
have been carrying out joint Nepal Portfolio
Performance Reviews (NPPRs) since 2000.
The main objective of these reviews is to
discuss generic issues affecting portfolio
management-such as security, passage of
laws and regulations, procurement,
financial management and safeguards-and
agree on time-bound action plans to resolve
the identified issues. A memorandum of
understanding is signed by all parties and
the actions are closely monitored and
reviewed semi-annually. The most recent
review was conducted in October 2002, with
a mid-term review taking place in May
2003.38 These joint reviews are
complemented by quarterly reviews of the
implementation progress of IDA projects,

in a higher level of transparency in public
procurement and enhanced accountability
in financial transactions. Portfolio
performance is expected to improve further
with the implementation of performancebased budget allocations and fund releases
under the MTEF, and systematic project
and program monitoring by sector agencies
and the NPC. There is an increasing
awareness to strengthen environmental
and social safeguards in all public
investments, but as indicated,
implementation remains weak and will
require continued support.

Formal reports include The Public Expenditure Review (FY00), Power Sector Development Strategy (FY01), The Business
En vironment and Manufacturing Performance (FY0 1), The Financial Sector Study(FY03), and The Trade and Competitiveness
Study (FY03).
In practice, the probabilities of 20, 40, 60 or 80% are assigned, recognizing the relatively crude nature of the probability
assessments.
This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases, it is likely that
some progress toward the ultimate outcome will have been made.
Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in reaching the expected rate of
achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank's efforts were inadequate.
Certain outcomes are stated rather generally for lack of a better definition. In such cases, however, annual milestones tend to be quite
specific to help clarity the kind of change the CAS hopes to support.
In the PRS matrix in Annex B1 1,in addition to linking the CAS outcomes to the PRS outcomes, the specific intermediate indicators/
activities corresponding to each of the milestones are also highlighted.
This has been made possible in part through the generous support of the United Kingdom's Departmentfor International Development

(DRD).

26 It is important to note, however, that the team looks at fiduciary issues in a much broader context than that covered by the CFAA. See Box
9 for details.
27 Good examples of this are the experience with the introduction of MTEF and development of IAP as noted in noted in paragraph 43.
28 As mentioned (see paragraph 47), the CPAR and CFAA have been completed. With regard to other core diagnostic AAA: (i) a PER was
completed in FY02 and a number of follow up pieces-evaluating the MTEF and analyzing SOEs-are envisioned for FY05; (ii) a Poverty
Assessment was completed in FY99, with an update planned for FY05; and (iii) a CEA is planned for FY05.
29 This will follow up on Understanding Children's WorkinNepal(March 2003). This study-carried out jointly with ILO and UNICEFincludes a set of recommendations and proposed policy actions that will help formulate a more comprehensive framework for handling
issues associated with child labor.
30 Purposely, the word 'reconstruction' is avoided, as the reconstruction needs are likely to be modest given that conflict-affected areas
tend to sufferfrom under-investment. Instead, what is required is a major effort to upgrade infrastructure and social services in these
regions that have long been under-served.
31 As indicated, the outcomes in Table 3 are those explicitly linked to the base case scenario and in a high case scenario there would likely
be more outcomes.
32 While the base case envisages an average annual lending program of about US$190 million, there is some uncertainty associated with
the ability of HMGN to implement projects under different security and political situations. As such, a realistic range-US$120-200
million-has been established.
33 Availability of IDA grants in FY06-FY07 will depend on the outcome of the IDAl 4 replenishment deliberations.
34 This is consistent with HMGN's Foreign Aid Policy (FAP) that states 'technical assistance for project design, institutional and capacity
building, technical backstopping, and project monitoring and review are more suitable for grant financing than for concessional loans."
35 Nepal is a 'less indebted low-income' country with a ratio of external debt to GDP of 53% and a total public debt to GDP ratio of 70% (end
FY01/02). IMF simulations suggestthat if keyvariables remained attheiraverage value of the lastten years, the total debtto GDP ratio
would decline to 53% in FY06/07.
36 Report No. 19850-NEP, dated November 1,1999.
37 The FY98 Annual Report on Portfolio Performance identified Nepal as a priority PIP country-i.e., a country with more than 50% of the
portfolio and/or more than 33% of commitments at risk, with more than eight active projects and/or US$250 million in commitments.
38 The mid-term review acknowledged progress and achievements since the NPPR, noting that the reforms have had a positive impact on
portfolio performance. However, a number of generic issues-including effectiveness delays, poor quality of civil works, financial
management, and cost and time over-runs-were noted as requiring priority action. The 2003 NPPR will be carried out in November.

C. Risks

82

The most important risk that Nepal
faces today is one of the country spiraling
into a widespread armed conflict and a
breakdown of state institutions. By
extension, this is the gravest risk the Bank
should be concerned with. The current
reform process has in fact emerged as an
antidote against the risk of widespread
internal conflict and the breakdown of the
development process. Hence, supporting it
must be at the core of the Bank's own risk
management strategy. Nevertheless, at the
next tier of the risk structure, it is useful to
consider various risks to the reform process
itself, so that the Bank is well-prepared to
support the reform process under different
circumstances. The fragile security
situation and political turmoil present
obvious uncertainties. At a deeper level,
however, there are two types of blockages
that may arise: (i) the possibility that the
reform process itself is stymied or reversed;
and (ii) the possibility that capacity to
implement the reforms-even if
commitment is sustained-becomes seriously
curtailed.

83

While the major political parties and
political leaders have tacitly supported the
current reform process, the risk of their
undermining the reform efforts out of short
term political considerations cannot be
discounted and would be consistent with the
politics of Nepal in the past. If the peace
process advances, there is also a risk that
some of the more control-oriented economic
policy agenda and unrealistic elements of
welfare state agenda of the insurgents (e.g.,
restrictive trade policies, stopping
privatization of SOEs, ban on private schools,
free social services) may influence the
reform program. When the more
technocratic interim Governments make
way for an elected Government, there is a

risk of old-style patronage politics returning
and with it tendencies for rent-seeking,
slowing of reforms and crowding out of the
reform-minded senior civil service leaders.

84

The reform leaders are acutely
aware of these risks and believe that the best
safeguard is the broad popular support for
the reforms. By giving the people and
communities more power and immediate
benefits, they can expand the political
constituency for reforms. This thinking is
clearly reflected in the 2003 IAP which
places a strong emphasis on service delivery.
In the medium term, as the broader PRS is
implemented, the Nepali people at large
should begin to expect good public service
delivery and public policies, rather than
more personal gains, from the political
process. Such a change could eventually
transform the patronage-based politics of the
past into a democracy that focuses on public
interests. In this regard, the basic strategy
of the Bank is to support the reformers to
accelerate the reform process. Close
coordination among the development
partners to send consistent messages is a key
element of the Bank's strategy. An added
risk mitigation measure is the starkly
differential lending scenarios-i.e., the
difference between the low and the high case
is potentially US$250 million per year-that
continue to send a strong message that the
Bank's financial support is linked to
continued reform implementation.

85

The second risk is mainly associated
with renewed and escalated hostilities that
would sharply reduce HMGN's ability to
implement the programs envisioned by the
PRS. While it would make the reform process
more difficult in the conflict-affected areas, it
may well stiffen the resolve of the reform
leaders to accelerate reform implementation
in the rest of the country. In such a
situation, continued support by the Bank

51

would no doubt give considerable
encouragement to HMGN to carry forward
the reform process. Renewed and severe
hostilities would also pose a fiscal challenge.
Security spending would rise and revenues
would suffer from further slowing in
economic activities. Although the rise in
security spending would be in part offset by
slowing development activities, the net
impact on HMGN's fiscal position would
likely be significantly negative. HMGN has
already positioned itself to cope with such a
situation in an orderly manner based on its
prioritized development program. Aware
that this is the only way to counter the fiscal
problems, the reformers-as in the last two
years or so-may also use the fiscal pressure
and the need to obtain budget support from
the Bank and other development partners as
a tool to further rationalize spending and
accelerate reforms.

86

52

Li

<:

A political impasse has developed
between the major political parties and the
interim Governments (and by association,
the King who appointed them). Although
the increasingly belligerent attitude of the
major political parties has dismayed many
Nepalis, there is a risk that this will lead to
wide-spread civil disorder and distract the
administration. In such a situation, even
the reform-minded technocrats would find it
difficult to get cabinet decisions on further
reforms and to keep the civil service focused
on improving public services. The Bank can

do little to mitigate such a risk, but it will
monitor the situation closely.

87

Lastly, an additional risk is that the
economic situation will continue to
deteriorate and Nepal will be even more
vulnerable to the external environment.
Given Nepal's dependence on tourism and
exports, unless there is a recovery in the
global and domestic economic situations,
Nepal's medium term prospects remain
bleak. Again, implementing the reform
agenda-specifically maintaining fiscal and
macroeconomic stability, and increasing
economic productivity and
competitiveness-provides the best chances
for mitigating this risk.

00
The challenges Nepal faces in taking
the reform process forward are formidable.
The cost of a failure, however, is nothing
short of widespread internal conflict, likely
resulting in the breakdown of the
development process. The current reform
leaders are very conscious of the risks and
the high stakes. In essence, implementing
reforms with more speed and vigor is their
strategy to reduce the risk of reversal, and
ultimately achieve peace and poverty
reduction. Supporting this process is the core
of the Bank's own strategy and risk
mitigation. This is consistent with the basic
strategy that the Bank has followed over the
last several years-support reform actions
consistently and forcefully.

39 In May 2003, the local donorcoordination groupagreed to breakfrom the tradition of having the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and the Bank as co-chairs and invited HMGN to chair the group.
40 HMGN has made impressive efforts in the preparation and initial implementation of the FAP that outlines objectives, guidelines, strategies
and policies aimed at guiding the flow and composition of foreign aid to ensure better aid utilization.
41 Board presentation of the IMF PRGF is anticipated for mid-November. Overall, IMF-Bank collaboration has been excellent. The proposed
PRSC Ihas been prepared in parallel with the PRGF and the two institutions are working closely to ensure that the programs reinforce
each other. For more information on the IMF program in Nepal, see Appendix IV.
42 Similarjoint support is being developed to assist implementation of the Health Sector Strategy. The Ministry of Health has established a
Health Sector Reform Committee to lead the reform process, including key donors (Germany, IDA, Japan, UNFPA, UNICEF, UK, US and
WHO), NGOs, and the prvate sector.
43 Performance isassessed everythree months. Upon announcement of the cease-fire, this rule was relaxed to expedite resourceflowto
insurgency-affected areas where project activities had been severely affected.

The PRS area isgiven first, whilethe lAP area isgiven second in parentheses. See Annex B1 1for PRS areas and Appendix Ill, table 1 for lAP areas.
Given the flexibility of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Instrument, inall likelihood the envisioned series of PRSCs (FY04, FY05, FY06 and FY07) will support achievement of most of the CAS outcomes. As such, the
PRSCs are not repeated for each of the outcomes, but likely apply.

This isthe policy reform matrix contained inNepal's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The tinal three columns have been added to highlight the assistance ot the Bank and other development partners in implementing the
PRS. Those items inbold inthe outcome column correspond directly to CAS outcomes, whereas items inbold inthe activities and intermediate indicators columns correspond directly to current Bank milestones. Finally,
given the tlexibility ot the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) instrument, inall likelihood the envisioned series of projects (FY04, FY05, FY06 and FY07) will support achievement ot many of the CAS outcomes. As such,
the PRSCs are not repeated under each ot the areas ot Bank involvement, but might likely apply.

assuming a quick transition to the base case,
the Bank continued to prepare a number of
larger, 'reform-heavy' projects and in
retrospect may have missed an opportunity
to develop and deliver a few more 'low case
appropriate' projects.
While in the low case scenario-i.e., between
December 1998 and December 2002-four
projects were approved for a total of US$94.6
million; specifically:
The Second Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP, Cr. 3185-NEP) was
approved in March 1999 (US$12.5 million).
Conceived as an Adaptable Program Loan
(APL), the objectives of the first phase are to
develop institutional capacity for qualitative
and quantitative improvements in primary
education. Through the project, a number of
donors-including IDA, Denmark, the
European Union, Finland, Norway, Japan,
UNICEF and the ADB-are providing joint
support to a well-formulated ten-year
sectoral program;

The Rural Infrastructure Project (Cr.
3215-NEP) was approved in May 1999
(US$5 million) to strengthen the institutional capacity of a decentralized governance
system in its planning and managing
capabilities to improve the quality, efficiency and sustainability of rural roads with
active participation of project beneficiaries.
Given limited Bank experience implementing community-based road projects in Nepal,
a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was
selected as the appropriate vehicle to test this
fundamental shift in approach. Through
this project a number of decentralization
options are being tested, including working:
(i) directly with the DDCs; (ii) with DDCs
through contractors; (iii) with CBOs; and
(iv) through NGOs. The many implementation challenges associated with this project
have made it a learning experience for all
involved. Nevertheless, recent results are

promising as confidence and experience are
being accumulated to work more effectively
at grassroots levels;
The objective of the Road Maintenance
and Development Project (Cr. 3293NEP)-approved in November 1999
(US$54.5 million)-is to help achieve sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation and
construction of an economically justifiable
strategic road network, while also promoting
more sustainable funding and efficient
public sector management of road maintenance. The project supports key sectoral
policy reforms by establishing a Roads Board
and Road Fund to assure a stable source of
funding for maintenance expenditures,
while at the same time providing motorable
access to isolated districts in the mid- and
far-west regions of the country (the heart of
the insurgency area); and
The Telecommunications Sector Reform
Project (Cr. 3581-NEP) was approved in
December 2001 (US$22.6 million) and

supports on-going sectoral reforms and
increasing rural access to telecommunications services through the licensing of a
private operator (selected on a competitive
basis) and establishing public telecommunications centers.
Following the move to the base case scenario
in December 2002, three additional projects
have been approved for a total of US$96.9
million, specifically:
The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 3227-NEP) was approved
in December 2002 (US$16.o million) and
supports the efforts of HMGN to improve the
financial sector in order to bring macroeconomic stability and promote private sectorled economic growth. The project focuses on
three major objectives: (i) helping to restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank

This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases, it is likely that some progress
toward the ultimate outcome will have been made.

Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in reaching the expected rate of
achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank's efforts were inadequate.

Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). However,
political uncertainties persist as major
political parties continue to maintain that
the appointment of governments by the King
since the dissolution of parliament is unconstitutional. The parties have also refused to
join the peace talks.
GDP growth is estimated to be 2 percent in
2002/03. The ceasefire has helped restore
some normality in the transport and service
sectors and the decline in tourism may have
halted. There are also signs that some
exports and manufacturing production are
rebounding. Inflation, which rose to about
71/2 percent in mid-May (12-month basis)
reflecting price developments in India,
administrative price changes, and supply
factors, is expected to moderate by early
2003/04.
The 2002/03 budget met revised targets set
in a mid-term review. Based on weak
revenue performance due to lower activity
during the first half of the year and external
aid shortfalls relative to the initial budget
targets, the authorities revised the budget at
mid-year. Specifically, the tax revenue
target and external financing were revised
down. To compensate for these shortfalls,
total expenditure was also revised down and
the revised budget set a net domestic financing target of 2 percent of GDP. Following the
announcement of the ceasefire, economic
activity picked up and revenue performance
improved. However, capital spending was
below the revised budget, reflecting continued implementation constraints at the local
level. As a result, domestic financing was
around 13/4 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy has been accommodative
and the real effective exchange rate has
depreciated. To help economic recovery, the

NRB lowered cash reserve requirements by 1
percentage point in August 2002 and
maintained a refinancing facility for lending
to "sick" industries. Aided by the recovery in
activity and monetary easing, private credit
appears to have revived and higher remittances contributed to a rise in banking
system foreign assets. However, reserve
money growth has been curtailed, due
largely to lower net credit to the government. Lending and deposit rates have
declined somewhat. The Nepalese rupee has
depreciated in real effective terms since
early 2002, reflecting the peg to the Indian
currency which has appreciated only
somewhat against the weakening US dollar.
Balance of payments developments turned
favorable in mid-2002/03 and external
reserves are adequate. Large and increasing
remittances helped buoy the current account. Garment exports began recovering in
late 2002, while recorded exports to India
declined, carpets and pashmina exports
continued to stagnate, and imports increased
with the recovery. The current account
(excluding official transfers) is expected to
move into a deficit of about ? percent of GDP,
but with higher aid and other inflows official
foreign exchange reserves are expected to
rise to US$1 billion (61/4 months of imports of
goods and services).
In 2002/03, significant progress was made
in financial sector reform implementation.
The NRB took steps to reduce staffing
through a voluntary retirement scheme
(VRS). Progress was made in restructuring
the two largest commercial banks, which
had external management teams installed.
The teams have prepared management
plans, made progress in assessing the banks'
financial status, and proposed VRSs to reduce
overstaffing. Some improvements have

Under Article IVof the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team
visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the
conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary istransmitted to the country's authorities.

Appendix V: The Main Findings of Two Key Fiduciary Assessments:
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)
A. The Country Financial

Accountability Assessment'
Context
Nepal's legal and regulatory framework for
ensuring public sector financial accountability is impressive for a country at its level of
economic development. The 1ggo Constitution requires the Ministry of Finance to
submit a detailed comparison of the financial
results and budgets of all ministries to
Parliament at the end of each fiscal year.
The Constitution also accords the Auditor
General (AG) complete legal and professional
independence, exempting his emoluments
and the budget of the Office of the Auditor
General (OAG) from parliamentary vote.
The Constitution also created a Commission
for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority
(CIAA) to investigate and recommend
actions against errant and corrupt officials
and prosecute them, if necessary.
Furthermore, when the Public Accounts
Committee (PAC)-headed by a member of
the main opposition party in Parliamentwas in session, it was proactive in its undertakings. It is schedule to meet year round
discussing public accounts and the AG's
annual report and recommendations, as well

as all aspects of public sector financial
management. All meetings are open to, and
receive full coverage in, the press, and it
intervenes in on-going procurement processes when impropriety is suspected. Its
collaboration with the AG is exemplary. It
sends the AG's recommendations to the
HMGN with a directive for the implementation of such recommendations.
The 1999 Financial Procedures Act and
1999 Financial Administration Regulations
(FAR) contain detailed and comprehensive
provisions for: (i) budget preparation and
approval; (ii) accounting and reporting on
budget implementation every four months;
(iii) a detailed report (Schedule 2 of the FAR)
that includes a statement, not only of
expenditures, but also of physical results and
goals achieved; (iv) elaborate procurement
and internal control procedures; (v) annual
financial statements at all levels, with a
consolidated financial statement for the
whole public sector at the end of each fiscal
year; (vi) internal and external audits; (vii)
ministerial review of project implementation
at regular intervals throughout the year,
with rewards for good performers and
explanations for poor performance.

In addition, the Government requested the Bank's assistance in two

areas: capacity building of the accounting

enhancing the capacity of the OAG towards
improving public sector financial accountability. In March 2003, the Bank provided
an Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grant of US$0.5 million. On the basis of the
CFAA recommendations and agreement
reached with the OAG, the grant will

essentially describe the financial powers of
various governmental authorities, and in
particular the procedures they should follow
in securing and disbursing the public funds
required to discharge their functions,
including the rules governing the procurement of public contracts. Having been
issued by government, these rules-i.e.,
FAR99-can also be changed by government,
without any approval by the legislature,
which it is felt in most countries is not in the
public interest. Rules of this nature, which
govern the use of huge amounts of public
funds, should be difficult rather than easy to
change, and they should be changed only in
a public and transparent manner.

B.The Country Procurement
Assessment Report2

Key Findings
Procedures and Practices

Context
Like most countries, Nepal's constitution does
not address the issue of public procurement,
but in contrast to most countries, there is no
law (in the sense of a generally applicable set
of rules enacted by the legislature) about
public procurement. In this respect, Nepal
(like its neighboring countries Pakistan and
India, and a few others) is different from
most other countries in the world. Most
countries have introduced a public procurement law, enacted by parliament which
alone can change it, which law deals exclusively with the public procurement of goods,
works and services by governmental entities
at all levels, and most often both for the
central authorities as well as those on a
provincial and communal level.
The system used in Nepal is represented by
the Financial Administration (Related) Rules
of 1999" (FAR99) was originally introduced
by the British but is no longer practiced in
the U.K. This approach consists of the
issuance by government (rather than by the
legislature) of a set of financial rules which

FAR99 represents an improvement over its
predecessor but the enactment of a Public
Procurement Law is a necessity. The Bank
revised the rules for National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) under Bank-financed contracts, in order to properly reflect the interests of the public purchaser. In fact, the list
(noted below) indicates the areas of the public
procurement system requiring attention.
* Provision of sufficient time for bid
preparation.
* Bidders access to bidding documents by
mail or in person.
* Evaluation of bids according to predisclosed criteria.
* Bid opening in only one place and
immediately after deadline for bid
submission.
* No preference to local bidders competing
with foreign bidders.
* Contract awarded to lowest evaluated bidder.
* No post-bidding negotiations with the
lowest or any other bidder.
* No bid rejection on the basis merely of
price estimates.
* No rebidding without IDA's prior concurrence.

The CFAA was jointly carried out by HMGN and the Bank beginning in December 2001, with the establishment of a high level National
Steenng Committee (NSC). The NSC played a pivotal and strong leadership role which demonstrated the high level of HMGN ownership,
and also was extremely useful in guaranteeing a high quality product. Throughout the process, a number of stakeholders meetings were
held, including with representatives of donors, government agencies, oversight agencies and private sector agencies. Following a
stakeholder's workshop in which over 200 people participated, formal discussions of the final CFAA report were carried out in June 2002.
Subsequently, HMGN adopted the Development Action Plan of the CFAA.
The CPAR was carried outas jointly between the Bankand HMGN. The workwas initiated in November 1999 and finalized in April 2002.
