EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Madagascar i s undergoing an exciting new beginning. A new and very proactive government was
i.
elected on an anticorruption platform with strong support from civil society, particularly the churches. The
government has already undertaken far reaching reforms to improve governance, increase liberalization,
develop the environment for private sector development and improve the quality o f social services. Policy
measures that have been taken include import tariff simplification and customs reform, concessioning o f
major public enterprises and key infrastructure. Further, an anti-conuption commission has been established
and a thorough and much needed reorganization o f the public sector i s taking place, including the reduction
in the number o f ministries and the new requirement for government officials to declare their assets. The
Government has also recently completed i t s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the objective o f
which i s to reduce poverty by h a l f in ten years. T o cany out this objective, it lays out three key priorities: (i)
improving governance; (ii)
promoting broad based growth; and (iiiproviding
)
human security.

ii.
This CAS i s designed to support the implementation o f Madagascar’s PRSP. The challenge for the
country and the donor community i s daunting. Madagascar i s one o f the poorest countries in the world with
a high vulnerability to external shocks, and 69 percent o f i t s population living under the poverty line. A
period o f high economic growth averaging 4.6 percent between 1997-2001 increased average living
standards nationwide but had a disappointingly l o w impact o n improving conditions for the rural poor. Even
during the period o f high growth, social service delivery to the rural poor worsened. In December 2001,
contested presidential elections led a to six month political crisis. The impact on economic and social
conditions was significant: GDP fell by about 15 percent, foreign investors left the country, bridges were
destroyed and exports came to a virtual standstill.
...

The country is, however, well placed to achieve economic recovery and growth. But poverty
reduction will only be successful if the rural poor can benefit from growth. Inadequate access to transport i s
the main obstacle to higher agricultural productivity, the provision o f basic services and a greater impact o f
growth on the rural poverty. This key finding i s reflected in the PRSP and the Bank’s lending program.
111.

iv.
This CAS refocuses the existing portfolio to better align itself to the PRSP objectives and to address
the key constraints to broad based growth. It also proposes new projects for transport, environment and
governance in FY04, an Integrated Growth Poles project for FY05 that will address infrastructure and private
sector development; and a watershed management project in FY06. The CAS also reflects a gradual
transition from investment to programmatic lending: a first Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) i s
foreseen for FY05 addressing education, nutrition and health. A second PRSC would follow in FY06 and
include water and household energy. Recently completed analytical work such as a Rural Sector Review, a
Poverty Assessment and financial management and public procurement reviews provide the foundation for
programmatic lending. Ongoing analytical work such as Public Expenditure Review (PER) and a
Development Policy Review, both in FY05, will also provide the analytical basis for policy dialogue.
v.
The base case scenario o f this CAS proposes a total FY04-06 lending program o f US$505 million.
The base case assumes that reforms will continue and that the Government i s successful in implementing i t s
PRSP. If the pace o f reform accelerates, especially in the areas o f governance and service delivery to the
poor, a high case scenario o f US$650 million for FY04-06 would kick in with a significant upscaling o f
programmatic and infrastructure support, but n o additional operations are proposed. If governance reforms
do not materialize and the PRSP i s not implemented, programmatic lending would not be provided and a l o w
case lending program o f US$370 million would focus on individual investments in key social sectors such as
education, health and nutrition.

vi,
T o help guide implementation and measure success, this CAS provides a policy matrix, a donor
matrix, a set o f key monitoring indicators, a lending scenario and triggers all set against the objectives and
three strategic axes o f the PRSP. The monitoring indicators will allow the Government, the Bank and the

donor community to determine to what extent the PRSP policy actions and programs lead to the desired
outcomes. The proposed alignment with the PRSP objectives i s intended to increase the overall nationwide
development impact o f Bank support, in addition to measuring performance on a project by project basis.
vii.
The strategy faces two types o f risks: (i)external or natural r i s k s which the government has no
control; and (ii)
risks which the government may influence. In the first category, Madagascar i s vulnerable
to various external shocks including cyclones, locust invasion, and international events affecting travel and
tourism. In the second category, there are five main risks: (i)
political risk and deterioration o f popularity for
the President and his reforms; (ii)
unsatisfactory implementation o f budgetary and governance reforms; (iii)
erosion o f trade preferences and slow pace o f reforms allowing other developing countries to become more
competitive; (iv) l o w confidence o f private sector investors in the Malagasy economy; and (v) difficulties in
PRSP implementation, due to weak institutional capacity, underfinancing or lack o f a coherent donor effort.

viii.
The CAS lays out several measures to mitigate these risks. A review to be undertaken in FY06 will
assess risk mitigation strategies for the external shocks Madagascar faces and which regularly undermine
growth and poverty reduction. Under this CAS, the Bank will try to achieve quick successes through
accelerated disbursements on existing projects and by advancing new lending activities to the beginning o f
the new CAS period. This i s intended to help the government maintain the broad support o f the population,
outweighing potential opposition by certain business groups that benefited from monopoly positions and
corrupt practices. Heavy emphasis i s placed on supporting reforms in public finance, budget programming,
procurement, institutional development and capacity building. Further measures to attract private investment
are being planned by the Government to reduce the risk o f other countries overtaking Madagascar's
comparative advantages. And efforts are being made to improve complementarity o f investments by the
donor community through intensified efforts to coordinate assistance, harmonize disbursements and
procurement procedures and develop common programmatic approaches centered around the PRSP.

Does the Board agree with the proposed strategic focus o f the CAS and i t s alignment with the
Government's PRSP?

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
Introduction

Madagascar i s currently undergoing an exciting new beginning. Having emerged from a deep
1.
political and economic crisis in 2002 which propelled extreme poverty to levels observed a decade ago, the
newly elected Government o f President Ravalomanana i s embarking on many courageous reforms which are
unique for Madagascar since independence in 1960. M u c h - and unprecedented -- attention has been given
to gaining confidence o f private investors by embarking on import tariff simplification and customs reform.
The Government has moved swiftly ahead with establishing public-private partnerships, including the
concessioning o f major public enterprises and key infrastructure. Further, an anti-corruption commission has
been established and a thorough and much needed reorganization o f the public sector has taken place, sharply
reducing the number o f ministries by one third.

I.

COUNTRY CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK

2.
The new government faces a daunting challenge. Madagascar i s among the very poorest countries in
the world. National per capita income i s around US$240 and approximately 69l percent o f the population i s
poor. Seventy percent o f the rural population cannot afford to buy a basic food basket even if they spent all
their income on food items. Forty-eight percent o f children under five are stunted. About one third o f
children complete primary school, and just over half the population can read and write. Only 35 percent o f
the population has access to safe drinking water. Over h a l f o f mothers give birth unassisted. Electricity
connectivity i s very l o w at only 15 percent.
Yet Madagascar has not always been as poor as i t i s today. In 1980 Madagascar had a per capita
3.
income o f about US$450. During the 1980s Madagascar implemented a number o f inward looking policy
actions which led the country on a downward path: central planning was introduced, productive enterprises
were nationalized and protectionism (so called “Malagasysation”) ensued, effectively closing doors to
foreign investors. Structural reforms that took place in the 1990s resulted in economic growth from 19972001, that was then set back due to the 2002 political crisis. However, the country has great underexploited
potential for economic growth and development (including a rich natural resource base, and several growth
sectors, such as tourism), as reflected in the growth experienced in the late 1990s.

A.

Macroeconomic, Structural and Political Developments since the last full CAS (1997)

What Drove Madagascar’s Growth in the late 1990s?
Structural Reforms brought Madagascar’s economy to a turning point in 1997

4.
Structural reforms commenced slowly in the late 1980s with a number o f policy reversals, and
gained momentum in the 1990s: Market reforms were introduced, parastatals were privatized, foreign
investors were welcomed and the country started to open up by lifting trade restrictions and simplifying the
Poverty rate i s latest available year (2001). According to simulations, however, the poverty rate i s estimated to have
increased to 73 percent as a result o f the 2002 crisis.

tariff structure in l i n e with regional trade arrangements. Export taxes on all products were abolished and
import prohibitions were lifted; export processing zones in which exporting f i r m s are exempt o f taxes were
also created. In 1994, the Central Bank became independent, the exchange rate was floated and current
account transactions were liberalized as Madagascar accepted the obligations under IMF Article VIII.
Domestic price controls were significantly reduced in key markets. Structural reforms in the fishing
(introduction o f a transparent license system), mining (cadastre update and mining permit legislation), and
tourism (waiver o f visa requirements) sectors significantly contributed to economic growth. Finally, inroads
into the privatization o f many public enterprises were made, albeit slower than had been expected. Legal
state monopolies in the power, petroleum, telecommunications, and air transport sectors were abolished in
1996 and competition laws were passed for each sector. Privatization o f banks and o f the petroleum company
i s completed, and privatization o f telecommunications i s under way.
5.
As o f 1997, the f r u i t s o f the reforms
started to show. Between 1997 and 2001, the
growth o f the economy outpaced population
growth and for the first time in decades per capita
income grew. As shown in Chart 1, growth
averaged 4.6 percent in this period and the budget
and current account deficits remained stable.

almost stagnant. Urban construction g r o G h reached high levels o f expansion during the 1990s. In the
services sector, the boom in mobile phones spurred telecommunication growth (average 10.4 percent) and
both tourism and banking performed well (around 7.5 percent growth each). Although relatively small in i t s
contribution to GDP (2 percent in 2001), the export processing zone (EPZ) boomed in the four years leading
up to the crisis, growing o n average almost 20 percent annually. A good part o f the tenfold increase o f
foreign direct investment into the economy, reaching US$112 million in 2001, consisted o f investments in
firms operating within the EPZ. Exports drove up, particularly in textiles and clothing, agriculture and
processed food, seafood and tourism, and contributed to the acceleration o f GDP growth. During the 1990s,
the export to GDP ratio almost doubled from 13 percent to 23 percent, and the share o f Madagascar in world
exports increased from 0.01 1 percent to 0.015 percent, while Africa’s share declined.

Although Governance remained Weak

7.
While structural reforms in many areas were advanced, governance remained weak. Closely linked,
perceived corruption in Madagascar i s extremely high. In the latest report by Transparency International
(2002), prior to the new Government taking office, Madagascar ranks 9gth o f 102 countries in the Corruption
Perception Index. Budget and financial management was a serious problem, and reforms in procurement,
and budget formulation and execution were being delayed. Although tariff rates for goods are moderate,
erratic application o f exemptions as well as long and cumbersome custom clearance procedures had led to
important downward swings in domestic prices o f basic products such as rice, undermining production
decisions and income o f domestic smallholder farmers. The judicial sector was widely seen as ineffective
and corrupt. It was not able to ensure the enforcement o f property rights (or to punish their violation).
Several resource extracting sectors, most notably mining, continued to operate largely outside o f the formal
economy with large amounts o f resources leaving the country unaccounted for. Similarly, illegal logging (or

2

the provision o f non-regular licenses) in the forestry sector was o f major concern as it complements the
poverty pressure on the remaining forest areas.

Poverty and Social Developments since 1997
Growth has had Little Impact for Most of the Poor

8.
During the strong growth period from 1997 to
2001, only a small percentage o f the total population
was able to move out o f poverty. Even starker, the
percentage o f the population in extreme poverty (those
that cannot afford t o buy a basic food basket even if
they spent everything they owned on food items)
remained basically constant in spite o f high rates o f
economic growth. Also alarmingly, poverty did not
decrease in rural areas, where three fourths o f the
population live. However, the urban poor did benefit.
9.
Chart 2 shows that the type o f growth
Madagascar experienced had a comparatively l o w
overall impact o f growth on poverty; much lower than
successful countries in South-East Asia.

Table 1 also shows that in the times o f growth,
Percent
not only was extreme poverty unchanging but also
service delivery did not improve. N e t primary school enrolment rates were stable (although public school
enrolment increased somewhat) but indicators measuring quality o f education remained the same or
worsened. Similar trends can be observed for the immunization rate and pre-natal consultations. Electricity
connections increased somewhat, although the rate o f electrification o f the country remains very low. Lastly,
while water connections increased somewhat between 1997 and 1999, they actually decreased in the boom
years o f 1999 to 2001.

Rural Poverty, access to markets and to social services
11.
O f the total road network o f about 31,000 km only about 5,900 km are currently in passable
condition - due to lack o f maintenance the country has lost an average o f about 1000 km o f roads per year.
Today the usable road network i s smaller than at independence even though population and traffic levels are
higher. About 80 percent o f the rural population has no reliable transport services due to poor road
conditions, and o f these one third has no road access at all. Studies suggest that lack o f access to roads and
markets, l o w agricultural productivity and rural poverty are closely associated.
In participatory
investigations as well as quantitative analysis o f household surveys, rural families stress poor roads and the
need to improve agricultural productivity among their major concems (see Appendix 1). This i s mirrored, for
example, in the relationship between yields and remoteness. Rural households better connected to markets
have a significantly higher productivity than those living in more isolation and the same relationship holds
for the use o f modern inputs such as fertilizer. Isolation also implies lacking access to financial institutions
and credit, forcing poor farmers to sell at times o f low, post-harvest prices.
12.
Rural well-being i s also linked to access to social infrastructure. Access to safe drinking water (35
percent o f rural population) and electricity connectivity (4 percent) remain feeble. Similarly, educational
performance in rural areas remains extremely l o w with an average o f only 4.8 years o f education for the head
of the household and retums to education-mirroring i t s quality-low as well. Lastly, rural poverty i s very
closely related to the incidence o f disease, especially malaria, plague, and schistosomiasis.

Rural Poverty and Environment

13.
High rates o f rural poverty i s putting pressure on the environment, and at the same time
environmental degradation, and associated top soil erosion, i s reducing agricultural productivity and
increasing rural poverty. It i s estimated that Madagascar lost about 12 million ha o f forest between 1960 and
2000, effectively reducing forest cover by 50 percent in just 40 years. The most severe losses took place in
the 1970s and early 1980s during the height o f the socialist revolution when the practice o f slash-and-bum,
locally known as tavy, was actively encouraged in order to produce more rice to feed the growing urban
population without need for investment in the declining irrigation infrastructure. Following the launch o f the
National Environment Action Plan in the late 1980s, deforestation rates have since declined from over
400,000 ha/year in 1975-1985 to around 100,000 - 200,000 haiyear during the 1990s. The national average
rate o f deforestation i s currently estimated to be around 1.2 percent generalized across all forest types.
Poverty and Gender
14.
Poverty differences are minor with respect to the gender o f the household head; and access to
schooling i s likewise equal across gender. Illiteracy rates, however, were significantly higher for women (42
percent) than for men (28 percent). 53 percent o f births are unassisted and maternal mortality rate i s 580 out
o f 100,000 live births. Women also suffer from traditional forms o f discrimination bias against obtaining
credit or owning land. While laws are in general gender-responsive, their implementation and enforcement
remains piecemeal.

The Year 2002: Political Crisis and New Foundations
15.
The 2002 political crisis was triggered by contested first round presidential elections in December
2001 which led to a stand-off between the candidates with severe economic and social consequences. The
standoff pitted the then-mayor o f Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, a self-made businessman from outside
the political elite o f the country, against the incumbent president Didier Ratsiraka. Mediation attempts
between Mr. Ravalomanana and Mr. Ratsiraka, l e d by the African Union, failed and the stand-off grew more
and more fierce with large parts o f the highlands isolated from the coastal areas through the destruction o f

4

bridges and road blockades, T w o parallel Governments with two Central Banks were established, leading to
a freezing o f Madagascar’s assets abroad, a suspension o f foreign exchange trading and a closure o f the
treasury bond market for several months. Violent conflicts, however, remained rare.
16.
International recognition o f the new Government o f President Marc Ravalomanana in July 2002
ended the political crisis. Roads which had been closed during the crisis re-opened, international flights
resumed, the central bank was re-unified and the foreign exchange market re-opened. The new Government
presented a reconstruction program to the donor community shortly thereafter and with the assistance o f the
donor community key public services were rapidly restored. The President’s power was significantly
consolidated by Parliamentary elections in December 2002.

The economic and social impact o f the crisis was stark. Direct revenue losses for households
17.
reached US$0.5 billion in 2002. Activity in several sectors, including tourism, transport and export
processing industry, came to almost a complete halt. About 150,000 workers lost their jobs in the formal
sector alone. Farm producer prices, especially in isolated areas o f the country, were cut in half during the
height o f the crisis, causing an unprecedented drop in rural incomes and putting future production at risk. At
the end o f the year, GDP had shrunk by almost 13 percent and inflation had increased to 13.5 percent.
Revenue losses o f the public sector were immense (around 4 percent o f GDP), largely due to the collapse o f
international trade. But public expenditures execution was similarly impacted so that the budget deficit
(including grants) worsened only slightly.
Impact of the 2002 Crisis on Poverty

18.
The economic collapse and discontinuation o f many public social services in 2002 caused
widespread social suffering. According to simulations based on the actual welfare changes in the different
sectors, the poverty rate i s estimated to have increased to 73 percent and the extreme poverty rate to 62
percent as a consequence o f the crisis as shown in Table 1. About 150,000 men and women lost their jobs in
the urban formal sector during the crisis, reducing family income for about one million people in the cities.
School drop-out rates in the first half o f 2002 rose to 14 percent, health service utilization declined to 36
percent in rural areas and 14 percent in urban areas. Especially worrisome was the decline in assisted births
(minus 16 percent) and prenatal care for pregnant women (minus 9 percent). B o t h urban and rural families
reported that they decreased food consumption, especially reducing the intake o f meat (up to two third for the
extremely poor).
New Government Policies Have Improved Social Service Delivery
19.
The new Government moved quickly to deal with the effects o f the crisis on the poor, and
contributed to a striking improvement o f the situation. A recent budget tracking survey has shown a dramatic
increase in primary school enrollment (+14 percent inscriptions at the beginning at the start o f school year
2002-03) due to a fee waiver for both public and private schools, which allowed parents to send their
children back to school despite reduced family income. The largest increases took place in more remote
schools. Similarly, crisis monitoring surveys have shown that utilization o f health centers has increased to
pre-crisis levels again, similarly due the temporary suspension o f cost recovery in health. Direct transfers to
rural communities have allowed these to maintain a minimum o f administrative services.
20.
Service delivery can be further improved by strengthening the coherence and efficiency o f the
service delivery system down to i t s deconcentrated facilities (e.g. health posts, schools) and decentralized
institutions (primarily communes). The new Government has made a commitment to strengthen the 1,492
communes which currently represent the only operational level o f decentralized governance in Madagascar.
Communes can be strengthened in the short t e r m through the transfer o f competences which have already
been assigned to these local governments, particularly with respect to local tax collection. Despite having

5

embarked on several waves o f decentralization since the early 199Os, Madagascar remains a very centralized
country, both administratively and fiscally.

And Have Established New Foundations for Economic Growth

2 1.
The new government was elected on an anticorruption platform, and over the past year has moved
aggressively to make high-priority changes in governance that would streamline the functioning o f the public
sector and set the foundations for a more enabling environment for the private sector. Immediately after the
crisis, the government assisted the private sector to restart production through immediate tax relief,
repayment o f public sector arrears to the private sector, and suspension o f value added tax collection on
investment products, cement and fertilizer. I t also prepared a reconstruction and development program after
the crisis, which donors supported through pledges totaling $2.3 billion over a period o f four years. The
Government also restored public services (rehabilitation o f destroyed bridges and roads, support for strategic
public enterprises). In parallel, prudent macro-policies created an environment supporting economic
recovery.
22.
More recently, the new Government has taken a number o f remarkable decisions, some o f which are
summarized in Table 2. They include the establishment o f an anti-corruption commission and a thorough
and much needed reorganization o f the public structure, sharply reducing the number o f ministries by one
third and merging, importantly, the budget, finance and planning ministries which finally makes the joint
planning o f public investments and current expenditures possible. The Government i s also tackling illegal
licenses in the fishing, mining, and forestry sectors and has taken steps to clean up the judiciary through the
removal o f corrupt judges. The banking system has been privatized; policies enacted to remove illegal
licenses for fishing and mining; and steps taken to improve the judiciary. Similarly, significant reforms have

Sources o f G r o w t h and Economic Outlook
23.
The actions and reforms on governance taken by Madagascar’s new government in the relatively
short time since the 2002 crisis are intended to support and stimulate the private sector and to signal to
foreign investors that Madagascar i s open for business.
Madagascar’s growth prospects are bright

24.
There i s enormous growth potential in most o f Madagascar’s economic sectors. Following the 2002
crisis, there i s n o w large spare unused capacity in textile and in the f i r m s operating in the EPZ zone. In the
textile sector shlled labor i s in abundance and wages are low. Activities in Madagascar’s r i c h mining sector
having been growing over the last years but the bulk o f these activities are taking place in the informal
sector; precious stones are smuggled in large quantities to East Asia at little benefit to the Malagasy
economy. Agricultural productivity and rice yields are among the lowest in the world as a result o f l o w use
o f fertilizers and distance to markets. The country’s natural beauty and unique bio-diversity present a large
potential to tourism. In spite o f the costs to the economy o f the political crisis that are s t i l l felt today,
economic growth in 2003 picked up significantly and i s expected to grow at least 6 percent. Table 2b shows
the breakdown by sector o f GDP growth in Madagascar. I t illustrates that growth was widespread across
economic sectors and that - with large unused capacity s t i l l in place, and that ability to withstand shocks in
one or two sectors - a quick increase in growth i s very likely.

Manufacturing. According to industry experts, Madagascar has l o w wages and relatively high
quality labor in the textile sector compared to other African countries. This will make it possible for
Madagascar to compete in textiles with Asian countries o n international markets in the short term and even
after the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing i s phased out. Madagascar has a tradition o f producing high
quality textiles; before the crisis, multinational f i r m s invested heavily in the EPZ and employment in the
EPZ tripled in some four years reaching 150,000 in 2002. Private operators estimate that the size o f the
textile industry could reach three times i t s pre-crisis level in two years. Necessary inputs in the short term

7

will be transportation, a more reliable supply o f power, enforcement o f simplified administrative procedures
for the registration o f companies, and efficient processing at customs.
26.
Agriculture/Rural Development. Although Madagascar has great potential to increase rice yields, the
most important crop for the rural population, agricultural growth in Madagascar has in the past been l o w and
primarily based o n expansion rather than on increases in productivity (see figure 1). Today average rice

Madagascar i s the largest producer o f natural vanilla in the world and there i s scope for increases in
production and exports provided that adequate transport and security facilities are in place. Growth
prospects for coffee, cloves, sugar, sisal and ground nuts are also good. Madagascar also has about 7.5
million heads o f cattle (zebu) and supports an extensive fish and shrimp sector. The shrimp sector i s the
second largest source of foreign exchange earnings and provides about 62,000 direct jobs and 218,000
indirect jobs for the country. Most agricultural sub-sectors are operating below potential due to lack o f
access to markets, lack o f security in the rural areas, poor water management, the use o f outdated technology,
lack o f rural credit and insufficient extension services. In parallel to increased productivity o f agricultural
production systems, Madagascar’s unique biodiversity resources offer interesting revenue generating
potential, which, if realized, could contribute to the reduction o f poverty as well as the conservation o f these
resources. To unleash potential in this arena, there i s a need to set access to biodiversity resources o n a more
rational and transparent footing as well as to develop revenue generation from non-extractive forest products
and environmental services, o f which eco-tourism, hydrological services, carbon storage and non-timber
forest products are the most promising.
28.
Mining. Today Madagascar has a small artisanal and informal mining sector with significant growth
potential. Gems and precious stones from Madagascar currently have little value added for the Malagasy

8

economy. The Government has started to standardize small mining ventures in recent years by designing an
integrated management plan for non-industrial small mines, and has created the legal framework by drafting
legal and regulatory texts (mining policy, mining code, law on large mining investments, statutes and
organization o f the National Mining Council). The Govemment's objective i s to increase the value o f yearly
exports o f gold and precious stones from US$21 million in 2002 to US$40 million in 2006. In addition to
small mining, R i o Tinto, one o f the largest mining companies in the world i s planning to invest in the mining
o f illiminite which i s expected to increase by ten-fold the value added o f the sector in the medium and long
run.
29.
Tourism. Madagascar has a large potential for developing eco-tourism. The wealth o f the Malagasy
fauna and flora, the biological diversity characterized by the thousands o f endemic species make Madagascar
an attractive destination for tourists. Until 2001, tourism was expanding, but the 2002 crisis dealt an
enormous b l o w to the sector. Since the end o f the crisis, tourism has picked up and hotel chains are investing
to expand capacity at levels above those o f 2001, increasing the number o f beds by about 1,000 by 2006.

Macroeconomic framework
30.
The macro-economic framework that Madagascar has adopted in the context o f the EMF supported
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and that i s reflected in the base case o f this CAS i s prudent:
i t foresees an average GDP growth o f 6 percent for the 2004-2006 period with initial growth being largely
driven by increases in manufacturing and services. Initially, agricultural growth i s expected to remain well
below the average growth o f the economy. In subsequent years, as productivity and access to markets
increase, agricultural growth i s also expected to be strong. The base case scenario assumes that investment
to GDP ratios will increase by about 1 percentage point a year reaching 21 percent in 2006. I t foresees
modest increases in the inflows o f foreign aid. Total foreign financing i s expected to amount to about $300
million a year (See Annex B6). Imports are expected to increase by on average o f 23 percent per year, while
exports would reach an average growth o f 20 percent driven primarily by a further expansion o f activities in
the EPZ zone. Reserves are expected to average about the equivalent o f four months o f imports o f goods and
non-factor services. O n the fiscal size a substantial tax effort i s foreseen to increase the domestic revenue to
GDP ratio from 10.7 percent in 2003 to 12.5 percent in 2006. Capital expenditures are projected to increase
from 7.3 percent o f GDP in 2003 to some 9.2 percent in 2006. The scenario projects a gradual reduction in
the budget deficits from 5.5 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 3.3 percent o f GDP in 2006.

HIPC Initiative and Debt Sustainability
Madagascar reached the decision point o f the HIPC initiative in December 2000. Since the
31.
beginning o f the initiative, IDA has monitored the HIPC program jointly with all multi-lateral development
partners present in Madagascar. Interim HIPC relief i s being provided by creditors accounting for 82 percent
of the total debt (i.e. the Paris Club creditors, IDA, Organization o f Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
the IMF, and the AfDB). In addition, modalities for the provision o f interim relief are being negotiated with
the European Union and Kuwait, while IFAD and BADEA have committed to providing their share o f net
present value (NPV) relief at the completion point. Despite the severe political and economic crisis o f 2002,
the relief committed at decision point should be sufficient to reduce Madagascar’s debt burden to a
potentially sustainable level, and i s projected to produce an NPV debt-to-export ratio o f 163 as o f end-2003
(the year most likely to be used as the base date for the completion point document), which would fall to 135
after the provision o f the additional bilateral assistance, significantly below the 150 percent used to assess
HIPC relief (see Table 3.). The NPV debt-to-revenue ratio i s projected to stand at 323 percent as o f end2003, but could fall to 258 percent by the end o f the next year, and 226 percent the year after.
32.
Under the base and high case scenarios, predicated on fiscal consolidation and continued export
growth, the debt service ratios also remain manageable, with the debt service-to-export ratio remaining
below 10 percent from 2004 onwards. In the context o f the PRSP framework, the country i s continuing to
follow a prudent debt policy for the foreseeable future, ensuring that foreign financing i s obtained on grant or
highly concessional terms.

GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND STAFF ASSESSMENT

33.
Madagascar’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper outlines a framework for the Govemment to
redouble i t s efforts to implement a new generation o f economic and social reforms - to improve governance,
create a business friendly environment for investment and accelerate private sector led growth and improve
social service delivery to the benefit of i t s citizens. The strategy was developed over three years, starting
under the previous administration and continued by the new government. Progress on developing the
strategy stalled during the crisis. Throughout the preparation o f the strategy, the Government consulted with
all stakeholders through a comprehensive participatory process.

10

A.

Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper

34.
The overarching goal o f the PRSP i s to cut the poverty rate by h a l f in ten years, from 70 percent in
2003 to 35 percent in 2013. T o reach this objective the strategy, based on the principle o f public private
partnership, has three main axes (i)
restoring a rule o f law and a well governed society; (ii)
promoting
economic growth with a large social base, and (iii)
promoting systems for establishing human security and
enlarging social protection. Fifteen policy areas and corresponding measures, proposed outputs and expected
outcomes underpin these strategic axes.
35.
The first focus aims to create an institutional framework o f good governance to foster fast and
sustainable development, and allow the State to effectively and transparently assume i t s role as facilitator and
driving force o f the economy. The axis o f governance encompasses anticorruption, democracy, r u l e o f law
and decentralization. The Strategy builds on the important reforms already undertaken by government
including the establishment o f an Anticorruption Commission and the reorganization o f the public sector, and
proposes further measures such as developing an anticorruption strategy and improving the civil service.
Medium term measures in public finance and expenditure management include fiscal reform, the
strengthening o f budget controls, and the improvement o f planning, execution and monitoring o f the budget,
consistent with efforts under the HIPC initiative. Improvements planned in the Justice system will help
create an environment that i s more conducive to private sector development and investment. Finally,
decentralization seeks to enhance economic and social development o f communes and provide citizens with
a better quality o f life by bringing the govemment and communities closer together, thus improving local
service delivery in areas such as health and education.
36.
The second area seeks to foster macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth; revitalizing the
private sector and promoting the development o f growth sectors. The main focus i s on improving the roads
network, and the Government’s investment program includes a US$ 1 billion road rehabilitation program.
The objective i s to fight rural poverty by connecting farmers to the market. The Govemment will also give
priority to improving the environment for investment and developing the private sector through promotion o f
national and foreign direct investment, property rights, exports, and I C T systems.
37.
The elements o f the third axis deal with the definition and the implementation o f systems o f social
welfare: food security, health, education, housing, environment. The highest priority here i s given to
education, and the Govemment plans to continue emphasizing the delivery o f universal primary education,
improve school completion rates and work on the quality o f teaching. Another key social protection area in
the PRSP i s health, in particular the fight against AIDS and malnutrition, safe drinking water and sanitation.
Immediate priorities in the Ministry o f Health’s Five-Year Plan 2002-2006 are to promote mother and child
health and to intensify the fight against malnutrition.

Joint World Bank / IMF Staff Assessment (JSA)

38.
The PRSP has several major strengths. First, it i s very highly owned. The new administration took
on the process fully, making important changes to the draft which existed before the crisis. Second, PRSP
preparation included substantial consultation o f all groups o f society. Third, the strategy includes a very
comprehensive poverty diagnostic -- albeit focused mainly on the income-dimension o f poverty. Fourth, i t s
overall strategy i s clear and well-argued. Lastly, it develops different macro-economic scenarios, linking
poverty reduction to various growth paths o f the economy.
39.
But the PRSP also has several weaknesses, which the administration will need to focus on during
implementation. First, while all PRSP programs set specific sector targets for the coming years, only very
limited costing has taken place as to h o w such targets can be achieved. Second, the key sectors o f transport
and education strategies outlined in the PRSP derive from an assessment o f why reforms are needed and why

11

public service delivery has failed in the past. Other sector strategies, notably those in the health, nutrition,
energy, water and agricultural sectors, have been assessed in general and forego this step. Third, the l i s t o f
measures included in the PRSP add up to a very ambitious program which i s bound to test the
implementation capacity o f Madagascar. Government will need to focus on capacity building to ensure
successful implementation. Fourth, during the first year o f PRSP implementation, Government will equally
have to harmonize the many different targets and indicators included in the document. While, laudably, a l i s t
o f thirty-one priority indicators for monitoring has been established, this l i s t o f indicators and their baseline
values are not always consistent with the detailed sectoral indicators found in the body o f the text. Lastly,
the PRSP does not include an assessment o f possible risks (and mitigation measures) that could negatively
affect implementation. (See accompanying Joint Staff Assessment)

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Millennium Development Goals

40.
In the case o f Madagascar, one o f the poorest countries in the world, ranked 149 out o f 175 on
UNDP’s Human Development Index, reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) i s challenging.
Appendix 2 summarizes today’s status and the historical progress towards reaching the MDGs as well as the
likelihood o f reaching each MDG by the year 2015 and Appendix 10 outlines key requirements for moving
to higher growth rates, increased poverty reduction and higher aid inflows. The Government’s objectives
under the PRSP are consistent with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The PRSP argues that the
required GDP growth rate i s about 8 percent in order to half the poverty rate from 70 percent to 35 percent by
2015 and reach the other MDGs as well. Under the high case scenario o f this CAS, performance would be
significantly stronger and policy implementation faster than what i s foreseen under the base case in key areas
such as the fight against corruption, integration o f the rural poor in the growth process, and improved service
delivery to the poor. Such performance would warrant significantly higher levels o f aid and would allow
Madagascar to reach a higher growth path and reach the MDGs. Increased levels o f concessional aid will
ensure that macro management can remain prudent and that increased levels o f investments and imports do
not lead to unsustainable debt problems in the future.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

A.

Lessons Learned: Progress Under Last CAS and the Interim CAS
Evaluation of the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy and Interim CAS

41.
The most recent CAS period which started in 1997 i s characterized by much progress in many areas,
despite the 2002 political crisis. The Bank’s 1997 Country Assistance Strategy had four main objectives;
(i)encouraging broad-based growth led by foreign investment; (ii)
enhancing human capital development;
(iii)strengthening the public sector; and (iv) managing natural resources. As shown in Table 5, the
objectives were met in most areas. The 1997 CAS outlined a substantial and detailed l i s t o f monitoring
indicators for each o f the four objectives. These monitoring indicators in Appendix 3 compare objectives
and actual outcomes. Compared to the objectives set in 1997, the outcomes seem to have been satisfactory.
However, some key outcomes, notably in the area o f rural poverty reduction were disappointing.

42.
The Bank’s Interim Country Assistance Strategy (I-CAS), presented to the Board in November
2002, outlined Bank activities in the post-crisis recovery period with the overall objective o f limiting the
impact o f the crisis o n the poor by supporting the Government’s reconstruction program (support to the most
vulnerable, public service delivery, private sector recovery). In parallel to the development o f the interim
strategy, the Bank’s portfolio was restructured to respond to the country’s most urgent needs. Poverty and
social development indicators were chosen to evaluate the impact o f the new crisis strategy. As shown in
Appendix 4 targets were met for the major y o f indicators that had been selected.
43.
What worked well. Macro
economic stability was achieved and
growth accelerated.
Major progress
took place, especially in the area o f
competition policy and divestiture from
state banks and public enterprises.
Substantially higher growth ensued
from 1997 to 2001 averaging 4.6
percent, reversing the earlier trends
of declining per capita incomes. Bank
assistance supported new structural
policies and was instrumental in
bringing about this higher growth
rate. These included price and trade
liberalization measures, privatization
and
the
opening
of
the
telecommunications sector, part o f Bank
structural adjustment programs. Based
o n good macro-economic performance,
new IDA commitments between FY97
and FY99 rose to US$525 million, some
15 percent above the amounts originally
proposed in the CAS.

Box 1. Education Achievements
During the 2002-03 school year Madagascar‘s education reform made
progress, with the help o f the Bank-financed and restructured
CRESED I1project. More textbooks were delivered to the primary
and secondary schools. In early 2003 the President made primary
education “free-of-charge”. This boosted primary enrolment, notably
children f r o m the poorest households. A l l primary schools receive a
small budget to improve the schools’ functioning, managed with
parent-school associations. In-service teacher training programs and
management o f district education units were improved and new
quality performance criteria were introduced. The participation o f
communities in the day-to-day school management was also
strengthened through more effective regulations.
At the start o f the current school year (2003-04), the sector ministries
continued to consolidate the various measures and better integrate
these into a systematic approach o f providing better services with a
results-based approach. The district education units were all replaced
(50% were new recruits) with three-year performance-based
contracts. The government’s approach to school-nutrition will work
through the communities by providing the primary schools in the
poorest areas with a small school nutrition fund for the five months
that hunger among primary school children i s most prevalent. This
also promotes better school-community l i n k s . Primary school
teachers who are currently paid by the (mostly poorest) communities
(about 4,000 teachers out o f the total o f 50,000) will be integrated into
the government’s payroll.

44.
The 1997 CAS objectives
were also largely met in the area
o f managing
natural
resources.
Preliminary Implementation Completion Report conclusions o f the Bank supported second phase o f the
multi-donor enGironment programindicate that in l i n e with stated objectives:
environmentai degradation
trends have been reduced; (ii)
sustainable use o f natural resources in target areas through conservation
agriculture has increased; and (iii)conditions for mainstreaming sustainable environment and natural
resources management have been established.

(i>

45.
In the aftermath o f the 2002 crisis and through i t s Interim Country Assistance Strategy, the Bank also
assisted the Government with an emergency recovery credit and the mobilization o f additional external
resources, so as to help: (i)
bring about a resumption o f growth; (ii)
limit the negative impact o f the crisis on
the poor; and (iii)
restore basic infrastructure destroyed during the crisis. O f particular importance for these
successful results was the flexibility that was built into the projects for a timely response from the Bank to
the crisis.

What worked less well. Three important shortcomings undermined the good progress during the
46.
previous CAS period: (i)
high rates o f GDP growth did not lead to the expected nation wide reduction in
poverty; (ii)
the delivery o f social services and the formation o f human capital was slower than anticipated;

13

and (iii)
governance problems and institutional weaknesses remained key impediments to all development
efforts.
(a) Too little pro poor growth: High overall GDP growth rates did not lead to the desired decreases
in rural poverty. There i s widespread recognition among the Government and donors that the
failure to prevent a further deterioration o f the road and irrigation infrastructure network and the
increased isolation o f the rural population contributed significantly to l o w agricultural
productivity and in turn, high levels o f rural poverty. This occurred in spite o f the existing Bank
projects in both the rural and transport sectors which had too little nation wide impact to make a
real dent in rural poverty. Moreover, both the Government’s public expenditure program and
Bank financed investments could have been better targeted to poor geographical areas. Chart 4
shows that the share o f IDA-financed investments to the poorest districts (comprising 40 percent
of
the
population)
varied
significantly since 1997. It first

Madagascar’s progress has been
slow in the social sectors: primary
school drop out rates decreased; infant mortality rates declined from 94 percent to 84 percent but
malnutrition remains prevalent Some progress was made in the context o f Bank projects but the
rate o f social progress fell well short o f both the CAS objectives and the requirements for
achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
(c) Governance problems slowed poverty reduction: With better governance, public funds could
have been better used for poverty reduction, and foreign direct investment as well as growth
would probably have been higher. There were too few checks and balances on financial
operations o f the Government, and rules were applied arbitrarily. Until the new Government
took power in 2001, very little public sector reform had taken place.
47.
With the benefit o f hindsight, therefore, the Bank assistance could have had a greater impact on
poverty reduction had it placed more emphasis on tackling rural isolation through a more ambitious road
construction and road maintenance program. In turn this would have led to higher rates o f agricultural
productivity. In all likelihood i t would also have contributed to better social service delivery in rural areas.
A stronger emphasis by the Bank on capacity building and the fight against corruption would also have had a
significant impact o n the fight against poverty.

B.

The New CAS: Objectives and Guiding Principles

Objectives
48.
The main objective o f the Bank’s future assistance program i s to help Madagascar accelerate poverty
reduction. Together with other development partners, the Bank proposes to support the Government in the
implementation o f i t s PRSP and align i t s work program to the framework and strategic focus o f the PRSP.
Appendix 5 maps PRSP programs to current and planned partner and IDA support. In line with the PRSP

14

objectives, the Bank intends to considerably strengthen i t s focus on (i)improving governance; (ii)
reducing
rural poverty and (iii)
improving service delivery. The Bank will measure i t s performance in reaching these
objectives by a select number o f contributions to reaching the PRSP targets themselves (see monitoring
indicators).

Guiding principles

49.
There are five guiding principles, derived from the lessons and experience o f the previous CAS, that
are at the heart o f the proposed strategy:
(1)

Focusing Bank interventions on having a much larger impact on rural poverty.
Madagascar has already taken most o f the first generation macro-economic and structural
reforms that are required to spur growth. At this point in time, the Bank interventions will
need to assist the Government in removing the impediments that are currently preventing
growth to reach the rural poor. Given that agriculture i s the most important activity o f the rural
poor, increased on-farm productivity through production intensification and diversification, in
parallel with improved access to markets and enforcement o f property rights to avoid further
soil degradation are considered key elements o f the rural growth agenda. In line with this, the
Government and the Bank see the development and maintenance o f rural infrastructure,
through the envisaged Transport and Watershed Management projects, as a crucial condition to
reduce rural poverty. It will be important to increase expenditure effectiveness in transport
sector as additional lending i s provided.

(ii)

Tackling governance and capacity building centrally and in all the Bank’s operations.
The key institutional and governance problems described in the PRSP affect all sectors o f the
economy: public financial management, public expenditure management, procurement reform
and related capacity building activities. These will be tackled centrally with the assistance o f
the Bank under one umbrella project that i s presented for approval in conjunction with this
CAS. They will also be addressed in every individual lending operation and every piece o f
analytical work that the Bank proposes to carry out.

(iii)

Continuing to place the environment at the center of our strategy: Madagascar’s natural
resource base remains vulnerable as high levels o f poverty are contributing to the use o f
farming and mining techniques that cause natural degradation and habitat destruction.
Environmental safeguards are given special attention both in the Bank’s existing portfolio and
in the Bank’s new lending program. In l i n e with the Government’s overall orientation on
“rapid and sustainable development”, the CAS proposes to build on the positive linkages
between poverty reduction and environmental management through the envisaged
Environment Project. This new project i s one o f the Bank’s instruments that will help
Madagascar further tap into these significant revenue generating potential o f i t s unique
biodiversity resources. T o unleash potential in this arena, emphasis will be placed on: (a)
putting access to biodiversity and forest resources on a more rational and transparent footing;
and (b) the development o f revenue generating activities from non-extractive uses o f natural
resources and environmental services, o f which eco-tourism, carbon storage, hydrological
services and non-timber forest products are the most promising.
Operations to have more widespread impact; transitioning to programmatic lending.
Despite the Bank having been the largest financier o f the Public Investment Program social
development and service delivery has not improved as wished for in the past on a nation wide
scale. Several individual projects have had too l i t t l e widespread impact and contributed too
little to achieving the MDGs. N o w that a comprehensive PRSP i s in place, there i s a need for
all programs and funds to go through the budget in a systematic way. This entails agreeing

15

with the Government on overall sector strategies in areas such as education, nutrition, health
and water, helping to identify and mobilize the resources required to implement the overall
sector strategies, as well as making sure that the necessary public sector reforms take place so
as to improve the efficiency and equity o f public expenditures. The Bank’s base case and high
case lending scenarios include a transition to programmatic lending along the lines described in
the Bank’s Strategic Framework for IDA’s Assistance to Africa (SFIA).

(4

Linking loan amounts to performance, and continuing to reduce the number o f active
lending operations by FY06. The Bank proposes to further reduce the active lending portfolio
to keep the size o f i t s portfolio manageable at fourteen projects over the CAS period. If overall
performance i s significantly better or worse than foreseen in the base case, the loan amounts
and scope o f the projects would be adjusted. Contrary to past practice, the number o f new
operations will not be changed so as the keep the overall size o f the portfolio manageable. The
gradual reduction o f the number o f projects has proven instrumental in devoting a higher share
o f the Bank resources on policy dialogue. The Bank has also consolidated i t s interventions at
the local level. All o f the procurement and implementation o f local infrastructure services has
been transferred to the social fund allowing the education and health projects to focus on their
respective sector issues. The Bank, like other donors also systematically involves local
governments in the identification and planning o f all local investments and i t channels some o f
i t s investment resources through them (social fund project). The Bank i s planning to
consolidate and expand these approaches in the future.

three years. Following the
restructuring o f the portfolio in November 2002, project implementation has greatly improved, resulting in
accelerated disbursements.
5 1.
The Bank’s existing portfolio i s well-placed to support the proposed strategic orientation proposed.
Table 6 shows the undisbursed project funds available in the active projects (excluding those that have very
few funds left). O f the US$457.8 million o f undisbursed funds at the beginning o f FY04, about 36 percent
are committed to rural development in the Rural Sector Development Project and the Community
Development Project (which focuses entirely on rural areas). With 29 percent, economic infrastructure i s the
second most important component, comprising two large Adjustable Program Lending Projects in Transport
as well as a demand-driven Urban Infrastructure Project. Around 13 percent o f undisbursed funds are
dedicated to the continued and important private sector support through the recently effective Second Private
Sector Development Project (which will also include ongoing support to establishing a competitive

16

investment climate and restructuring,
concessioning and privatization o f
public enterprises) and the Mineral
Resources
Governance
Project,
focusing o n establishing and enforcing
rules and regulations in the highpotential mining sector in Madagascar.
T w o percent o f undisbursed funds are
dedicated to the M i c r o Finance project.
Finally, with respect to the ‘human and
material security’ focus o f the PRSP,
the existing lending portfolio consists o f
the Education Sector Development
Project (7 percent o f total undisbursed
funds), the HIV/AIDS Prevention
Project and Second Health Support
Project (together 9 percent), the Rural
Water Pilot Project (2 percent), the
Nutrition III Project (3 percent).

O E D Evaluation. Since the last C A S in 1997, while the percentage o f projects with satisfactory
outcomes (average 76 percent) has increased over time, the sustainability and institutional development
impact o f the projects has been persistently low. Approximately 40 to 45 percent o f recent projects in
Madagascar have been sustainable and only 30 to 35 percent o f the projects have had substantial impact on
institutional development. This CAS period will focus o n reversing this trend and o n closing the growing gap
between project outcome ratings and sustainability and institutional development impact. Following the

17

guiding principles o f this CAS, governance and capacity building will be addressed in all existing and
planned Bank operations.

New Lending
53.
The base case lending scenario proposes seven new operations over the next three years: a
Governance Support Technical Assistance Project; a Third Environmental Project, a Third APL Transport
Project, First Poverty Reduction Support Credit, an Integrated Growth Poles Project, a Second Poverty
Reduction Support Credit, and a Watershed Management Project. Table 7 shows h o w these lending
instruments support the strategy presented in the PRSP.

PRSP Strategic

Focus

FY06

54.
The Governance Support TA (FY04) will assist Government in operationalizing the first strategic
focus o f i t s PRSP. It i s part o f a concerted donor effort involving support from UNDP, EU, France and
U S A I D . The primary focus o f the project will be public finance management, providing assistance needed to
implement the conclusions o f the C F A A and CPAR. Other project components include support for the fight
against corruption, legal and judicial reform, as well as monitoring and evaluation activities. This project i s
designed to accompany the PRSCs to support governance reforms necessary for their success.
55.
The Third Environment Project (FY04) seeks to improve forest management, to protect biodiversity
and to put in place sustainable mechanisms for the environment. Considering that Madagascar i s a megabiodiversity country, this project i s o f crucial importance to attain the sustainable environmental management
objectives as specified under the MDGs. Following feedback from QAG, the Second Environment Project
(EP2) was restructured to focus on biodiversity conservation areas. In line with this approach and to
optimize operational effectiveness, the proposed follow-up Environment Project (EP3) will be limiting i t s
interventions to key biodiversity conservation areas, including national parks, buffer zones and the forestry
sub-sector. Besides helping to protect natural resources, investing in the environment also makes sense from
an economic as well as a poverty alleviation perspective. Economic analysis o f the project shows that
benefits exceed costs and that poor farmers engaged in downstream agricultural production activities capture
an important share o f these benefits. Economic benefits o f the project are related to eco-tourism, hydrological
services and international willingness to pay for globally important biodiversity, while economic costs cover
both direct conservation costs as well as the opportunity costs o f foregone alternative natural resource use.
56.
The third phase o f the Adaptable Programmatic Loan in Transport (FY04) would continue the joint
donor-government sector-wide transport program which has focused on sector reform and priority
rehabilitation (APL1, FYOO) and rural transport (APL2, FY03) and would include missing financing for the
rehabilitation o f the national road network and in the port and airport sub-sectors. The APL goes hand in
hand with significant sector reforms focusing the Government on sector oversight, coordination and
planning, transferring executive and regulatory functions to arms-length agencies, and operations to private
sector operators via concessioning arrangements. The Northern Railway has already been concessioned to a
private operator, while efforts are underway to concession the Southern Railways, the Tamatave port and the
Ivato airport.

18

57.
The First Poverty Reduction Support Credit (FY05) will focus on education, nutrition, protecting the
most vulnerable against shocks. Through general budgetary support it will help finance the Education for All
agenda by providing funding for new teachers in rural primary schools, teacher training, building new
classrooms, and procurement o f equipment and supplies for schools. The credit will support reforms in
governance, and help fund the Government’s child nutrition program. I t will also assist in putting in place a
permanent social safety that will provide work at wages below the current market wages for all those who are
willing to work for those wages in a time o f crisis. Key indicators that will be used to assess progress under
the credit will include: school enrollment rates, completion rates for primary education, class repetition rates,
child malnutrition rates. Under a well designed scheme, the number o f people making use o f the permanent
safety net will also serve as a useful indicator to assess changes in poverty and change in market clearing
wages over time.
58.
The Integrated Growth Poles Project (FY05) will support accelerating growth in selected regions.
The project will provide a minimum infrastructure platform to allow the development o f agriculture and
agro-processing, mining, tourism and export processing zones in these regions. It will rely on public-private
partnership concepts, whereby public investment will cover most o f off-site infrastructure and private
investment will cover most o f on-site infrastructure. I t i s expected that the minimum infrastructure platform
will mostly consist o f investments in the water and sanitation, transports (including road, railway, airport and
port), urban, and energy sectors.
59.
The Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (FY06) would support the two areas covered under
PRSCl (education and nutrition) as well as health, rural water, and household energy. Government i s
currently embarking on a reform o f the health sector, focusing on primary health care and district hospitals.
IDA i s supporting those activities through the restructured second health sector project, which i s due to close
in FY06. Similarly, work on rural drinking water i s now supported by a pilot rural water project, which will
also close by FY06. I t i s expected that those two activities will be financed under the general budget and be
supported by PRSC2 which would include health and water connection indicators.
60.
The Watershed Management Project (FY06) would be instrumental in generating the conditions to
accelerate economic growth in the rural areas through an integrated effort aimed at raising productivity in the
high potential production poles. The comerstone o f this project would be to unleash the unrealized potential
of Madagascar’s vast irrigation infrastructure, most o f which i s in decay due to neglect o f the institutional
structure for operation and maintenance. Since 80 percent o f all irrigation infrastructure i s concentrated in
eight (out o f 20) agro-ecological regions, interventions o f the project would be limited to these: Marovoay,
Melaky, Diana, Alaotra, Atsimo-Andrefana, Menabe, Vakinankaratra and Imerina Central. In light o f the
fact that past irrigation investments have not generated expected results, the project would adopt a watershed
management approach under which investments in irrigation infrastructure, environmental protection
measures, local capacity building, and technology transfer would be adequately balanced based on
international best practice.
Analytical and Non-Lending Services

61.
Seven pieces o f AAA are proposed for the period FY04-06, which would complement recently
completed work and support the Government’s analysis o f the six PRSP sub-programs (Table 8). A
comerstone o f the non-lending activities would be the Public Expenditure and Service Delivery Review
(FY05). The review would be instrumental in establishing baseline assessments against which progress in
pro-poor expenditure distribution and service delivery could be measured. Ideally, informal and joint donorGovernment public expenditure reviews would follow on an annual basis. Formal health sector (FY04) and
risk and socialprotection (FY06) reviews have not been done in recent years and are much needed to support
the Government in implementing the PRSP. The Risk and Social Protection Review would also undertake an
assessment o f risk mitigation strategies needed for the various external shocks Madagascar faces (cyclones,
droughts, locust invasion) and which regularly undermine growth and poverty reduction. The planned

19

activities also include a Development Policy Review (FY05) which would focus especially o n macro and
structural policies to achieve pro-poor growth and a Land Tenure Review (FY05) that analyzes constraints to
land security for farmers and ownership issues and looks at ways to overcome them.
62.
At the Government’s request the Bank i s increasingly involved in a dialogue on trade policy issues.
The main vehicle for this dialogue has so far been the report on the Integrated Framework (IF) (FYO4),
which was completed in close cooperation with UNDP, WTO and the IMF. Trade reforms are viewed by the
Government as one o f the catalysts for attracting private sector investment and higher economic activity.
Madagascar’s maximum tariff i s currently 30 percent and Government plans to reduce it over time, while
also moving to a more uniform tariff structure. The IF shows that reforms in governance and improvements
in infrastructure are at least as important for Madagascar’s successful integration in the world economy as
changes in tariff levels. I t i s particularly important for Madagascar to reform i t s customs to reduce
corruption and accelerate procedures, rebuild i t s transport infrastructure to integrate domestic markets as well
as to link them with the outside world, and increase competition in the telecom and energy sectors to reduce
costs. Together with the other IF donors the Bank will continue to support Madagascar in those areas
through dialogue and TA. Other major non-lending services will include continued support and monitoring
o f the implementation of the PRSP and helping Madagascar reach the completion point o f the HIPC
initiative.

IFC. The Africa Region poverty reduction strategy places economic growth at the heart o f the
agenda and emphasizes the role of the private sector, which in the Malagasy context means Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). SMEs have been particularly hard hit by the recent crisis. The IFC has
recently reinforced i t s presence in Madagascar with the setting up o f the first ever joint Africa Project

20

Development Facility-African Management Services Company (APDF-AMSCO) regional office, based in
Antananarivo. To address the main constraints to small enterprise growth in Madagascar, IFC will contribute
with two initiatives. First, a joint I D N I F C program will be implemented within the context o f updated
W o r l d Bank and I F C strategies for Africa. Madagascar has been selected as part o f the seven pilot countries
for new joint IDNIFC M S M E Programs. The Program will be built o n three main pillars: (i)
access to
financial services; (ii)
access to business development services, including strengthening inter-firm linkages,
and information access; and (iii)
improvement in the business environment for MSMEs. The Madagascar
component o f the Program should be effective by FY05.
64.
Second, in the immediate future, I F C will introduce a new platform for providing integrated services
(access to finance, capacity building, access to information & business enabling environment) to the S M E
sector. The concept promotes an integrated approach to fulfilling SME needs. The objective i s to establish
physical locations that offer an integrated package o f fit-for-market solutions to drive the continuous
development o f African SMEs. The location will be referred to as an S M E Solutions Center (SSC). IDA
contribution i s expected to fund a portion o f the SME financing vehicle, starting in FY04.
65.
MIGA. MIGA i s underwriting an o i l and gas project in Madagascar with potential coverage o f
US$30 million in FY04. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Madagascar consists o f two contracts o f guarantee
in the power sector with a gross exposure o f USfi1.44 million and a net exposure o f US$722,100. The total
amount o f foreign direct investment facilitated i s estimated to be U S $ l 2 0 million.
66.
The World Bank Institute (WBI) i s working closely with the Government o f Madagascar and
programs for Madagascar have increased in the last three years. In June 2003, WBI organized a special
learning event for the entire cabinet to bring practitioners from around the world to share experiences on
effective economic management and achieving reforms in social, economic and political crisis situations.
Building on this dialogue, and beginning in FY04, Madagascar will be a WBI focus country. WBI will work
with other development and learning partners to develop and deliver customized program o f capacity
building and knowledge sharing in high priority areas identified in the CAS. The WBI Madagascar Country
Program B r i e f will identify the details o f this program, based an assessment o f needs and available learning
infrastructure, including the planned Madagascar GDLN site.

IMF. IMF and W o r l d Bank staff maintain a close working relationship, especially with respect to
67.
(i)
completion o f the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Joint Staff Assessment; (ii)
reforms set
out at the decision point o f the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiatives; (iii)
analyses and reforms in
public financial management; (iv) other governance reforms, including customs; (v) support o f the
privatization program; and (vi) participation in the integrated framework trade project. In June 2003, the
Fund completed i t s third review o f Madagascar’s PRGF-supported program and approved a disbursement
amounting to US$15.9 million.
Role o f other partners
Partner Coordination. This CAS i s developed in very close cooperation with Madagascar’s
68.
development partners. First, the Bank plans to commence programmatic lending together with the African
Development Bank and the European Commission based on the same policy and indicator matrix. Second,
the education, health, transport, water, agricultural and environmental sector reforms and investment needs
would be approached together with other partners through sector-wide approaches. Third, key reforms in
public financial management and against corruption would bring financing from IDA together with technical
assistance from GTZ and the French Cooperation which has been secured. Fourth, the Bank i s in the process
o f agreeing with other partners in Madagascar on selective support o f the PRSP which would, for example,
assign to the European Commission and U S A I D the lead in supporting justice reform, or to the French
Agency o f Development the support o f strong sectors (like fishing). Lastly, the Bank would continue as in
the past to organize donor meetings, and conduct joint supervision and evaluation missions o f Madagascar’s

21

(i)
PRSP with all bilateral and multilateral donors present (and issuance o f joint Aide Memoires); and (ii)
HIPC progress together with all multilateral donors.
69.
CAS consultations. The Bank Strategy has been discussed and developed with the Government and
Madagascar’s major development partners as shown in Appendix 6. The Bank engages actively with civil
society and journalists to obtain their feedback on a regular basis.

IV.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

PRSP and CAS Policy Matrix
70.
The new CAS i s anchored to the PRSP and supports the policy actions and programs that
Government will carry out in the implementation phase o f the PRSP. T o guide the implementation o f the
PRSP and this CAS, a policy matrix has been developed and i s shown in Appendix 8. The policy matrix
lists: (i)the main objectives of the PRSP; (ii)
the key policy actions and programs that the Government
intends to carry out to reach the objectives o f the PRSP and that are supported by the Bank; (iii)
the timing o f
these programs and policy actions; and (iv) the intended outcome o f these policies and programs.

MonitoringIndicators
71.
This CAS distinguishes itself from the 1997 CAS through i t s move to programmatic lending and a
stronger emphasis on achieving country wide rather than project specific outcomes. Through the PRSP
process, the donor community and the Bank have aligned their objectives to those outlined in the PRSP.
Given the size and importance o f the donors in the financing o f the Government’s development program, the
objectives and success o f the Government closely reflect the objectives and success o f the donors.
Therefore, the Government, donor community and the Bank have developed common monitoring indicators
to measure the extent to which the PRSP objectives are met. At the strategic level, the Bank has selected a
few key monitoring indicators to evaluate the success o f the implementation o f the CAS. At the operational
level, the Bank will continue to assess the impact o f the Bank program on PRSP objectives through i t s
lending operations and AAA work. Appendix 9 shows the baseline value o f the indicators and the expected
target for the end o f this CAS period.

Lending scenarios
72.

Three lending scenarios are envisaged: base case, l o w case and high case.
(a) Base case: The base case scenario envisages a move towards a Poverty Reduction Strategy
Credit (PRSC) starting in FY05. The starting point for the implementation o f the base case i s
that the macro-economic framework remains sound. The base case further assumes satisfactory
implementation o f reforms that are key to poverty reduction as outlined in the PRSP. Special
attention will be given to the implementation o f governance reforms. The specific policy actions
that the Bank will assess before approving a PRSC are listed in Appendix 7.
High case: A high case lending scenario could be envisaged if Madagascar can demonstrate that
the programs and policy actions i t i s implementing lead to the intended outcomes in terms o f
lower levels o f rural poverty, better service delivery for the poor, and improvements in

governance. The Government and the Bank have agreed on selected policy actions and
outcomes that will be assessed and will form the basis for decision to move to a high case
scenario. These selected outcomes are listed as triggers for the high case in Table 10; they will
be monitored using the monitoring indicators shown in Appendix 9. The macroeconomic
scenario underlying the high case i s that strong performance o f the govemment in policy and

22

institutional reform leads to a higher growth rate, in the range o f 7-9 percent, and higher level o f
aid, possibly reaching 23 percent o f GDP by 2006. Such a scenario would yield an average
FY04-06 current account deficit o f about 7 percent o f GDP and would require additional levels
of aid o f about 150 million a year over and above the foreign financing identified under the base
case scenario. Under the base case only about half o f the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) are expected to be met. Continued good performance as envisaged under the high case
growth scenario, however, combined with policies that benefit the rural poor, will set the stage
for Madagascar to reach all o f the MDGs by 2015. Under the high case lending scenario, the
Bank intends to increase i t s total lending envelope to US$650 million. I t will do so by
increasing the loan amounts for each operation as shown in Table 9.

(b) Low case: Governance reforms are central to the PRSP. Hence, the l o w case lending scenario i s
defined as one where those reforms are off-track. In this case it would not be possible to proceed
with the preparation o f a PRSC. Instead, the first PRSC would be replaced by an education
sector credit, and the second PRSC by a health and nutrition credit. Other projects would be
maintained but at a lower level o f funding. Overall lending would be kept at about US$370
million for the three year CAS period.

In deciding to move from one lending scenario to another, the Bank will assess: (i)the extent to
which policy actions are taken and PRSP programs are implemented and (ii)
the actual outcomes o f the
policy actions and programs. T o guide this assessment, we are proposing to use the triggers shown in Table

Grants
74.
Madagascar i s eligible for grant financing in FY04 under IDA’S Thirteenth Replenishment in the
poorest country category. Grant allocation i s part o f performance-based IDA allocation with a cumulative
target o f 20 percent grant share o f commitments for FY03-04 in the poorest country category. In FY04, the
Bank proposes to use the entirety o f Madagascar’s IDA13 grant allocation for the proposed Third
Environment Project. This reflects the global benefits associated with improved biodiversity conservation
that i s expected to be achieved under the project. Grant resources would be used to ensure proper
management o f Madagascar’s protected areas system as well to bring forest and biodiversity assets outside
protected areas under effective conservation regimes.

V.

MANAGING R I S K S

75.

The Bank sees five main risks in the implementation o f i t s strategy:
(a)

First, Madagascar i s vulnerable to various external shocks including cyclones and locust
invasion, which regularly undermine growth and poverty reduction. The Bank proposes a Risk
and Social Protection Review to assess needed risk mitigation strategies for the external shocks
Madagascar faces.

See Annex 9 for details concerning the monitoring o f these triggers.
Fonds d’Entretien des Rbeaux Hydroagricoles

24

(b)

Second, political stability i s key for implementing the PRSP and the CAS. The political crisis
o f 2002 and i t s economic aftermath illustrated the vulnerability o f Madagascar to political
shocks. The new administration i s undertaking significant changes in economic management,
which would lead to the elimination o f rents. Currently, the President’s popularity i s very high
and this allows him and his administration to move swiftly and implement policy actions.
However, were his popularity to decrease and margin o f maneuver to narrow, the
implementation o f the PRSP and the programs contained in the new CAS would slow down.
In turn, the population would not see the expected results on the ground further undermining
the support for the new Administration. The Bank will focus o n transparency and trying to
change the culture o f granting ad hoc privileges through the governance project and WBI
capacity building support. The Bank also proposes to mitigate this risk by trying to achieve
quick successes. This would require accelerating disbursements on existing projects and by
advancing new lending activities to the beginning o f the new CAS period. The Bank has
started on this track by achieving high disbursements in FY03, and i s expected to continue due
to the eventual transition to adjustment lending.

(c)

Third, fundamental public finance, budget programming, procurement reforms, institutional
development and capacity building are necessary conditions for Madagascar to improve public
sector efficiency and investment levels which would be necessary to absorb more external aid
inflows. If these reforms were to be delayed and not prioritized, the planned increase in public
investments for poverty reduction would likely not materialize. T o mitigate this risk the Bank
i s placing a heavy emphasis and supporting the reforms proposed in the areas o f public finance,
budget programming, procurement, institutional development and capacity building. The
proposed Governance technical assistance i s the key operation in the Bank’s strategy that will
allow Madagascar to increase i t s capacity to absorb external aid and use it effectively in the
pursuit o f i t s PRSP objectives. In addition, ongoing operations will continue to put a heavy
emphasis on institutional strengthening, training and capacity building.

(d)

Fourth, sustainable poverty reduction will depend on attracting private investment into the
labor-intensive manufacturing sector and into agro-businesses with spread effects to rural
areas. Currently, confidence o f private sector investors in the Malagasy economy i s s t i l l fragile
due to the effect o f the political and economic crisis in 2002. If Government does not succeed
to reestablish confidence o f private investors, the targeted high growth and poverty reduction
path would not materialize and could allow other developing countries to become more
competitive.
The strategy mitigates this risk by supporting the Government in the
implementation o f the Bank’s reports and recommendations on the Integrated Framework for
Trade and Private sector development, the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and the tourism
sector. Similarly, another risk i s the erosion o f trade preferences by the EU and US; Cotonou
agreement will be replaced by reciprocal EPAs and AGOA will phase out in 2008. Without
the preferences, Madagascar may not be able to compete with other developing countries such
as China and Bangladesh. Risk mitigation would include acceleration o f reforms to improve
competitiveness as in the Integrated Framework report and active participation in trade
negotiations (EU, WTO, regional). Moreover, it i s hoped that the implementation o f ongoing
governance reforms laid out in Appendix 8 will have a strong signaling effect and encourage
private sector investments.

(e)

Fifth, as mentioned in the Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), Madagascar’s PRSP i s ambitious and
i t s objectives can only be reached if: (i)
key reforms take place; (ii)
significant institutional
strengthening occurs; (iii)
if donors align their support to the PRSP; and (iv) if the required
financial support form the donor community i s forthcoming. To mitigate this risk, the donor
community has already started to intensify i t s efforts at coordinating assistance programs,

harmonizing disbursements and procurement procedures and developing common
programmatic approaches centered around the PRSP. The donor community has also started to

25

increase i t s level o f financial aid to Madagascar, and focus on technical assistance and capacity
building for sustainability. N o w that the PRSP i s finalized coordination will be centered more
strongly on implementation and results, using the PRSP monitoring framework.

Appendix 6. COUNTRY CONSULTATIONS:
A FULL PARTICIPATORY PROCESS
Consultations o n the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which underpins this C A S and other donor strategies, and
the Bank’s program, are necessarily intertwined.
The comprehensive participatory process o f the Government, and donor support for it, i s organized by the
Secretariat Technique de Z’Ajustement (STA) which acts as a technical secretariat to a PRSP Technical
Committee, composed o f representatives o f a l l sector ministries, several non-governmental organizations, and
academia. Six thematic working groups (rural development, infrastructure, health, education, private sector
development and governance) were constituted in the Fall o f 2000 and met regularly throughout the process.
Ongoing discussions between the Bank and the S T A and the involved ministries helped prepare the National
Workshop for Consultations o n the draft full PRSP held o n March 25-26, 2003 w i t h more than 600 participants
from a wide spectrum o f opinions, including a former Chief o f State, former and current Prime Ministers and
Ministers, opposition parties, and the donor community. Govemance, Institutional Development, justice,
corruption, growth, infrastructure, education, health, AIDS, agriculture and environment, water and sanitation
were considered priorities.
The PRSP was redrafted to include the recommendations o f the National Workshop while financial and
procurement reviews have been concluded as joint documents between the Government and Bank under the
chairmanship o f the Deputy Prime Minister.
President Ravalomanana, w i t h the assistance o f the Bank, organized o n June 16-18, 2003 a Colloquium for the
Cabinet and ministry officials with leaders in the financial and economic areas from around the world. These
targeted dialogues and consultations including the PRSP Workshop, the Cabinet Colloquium have already borne
fruit. The President announced important and unprecedented reforms for facilitating foreign and national
investments, including restructuring tax and customs and land ownership rights, especially for foreigners.
Throughout the consultation period, the B a n k h e l d extensive discussions with the Government and other
stakeholders including the donor community, the political world, the ecumenical leadership o f the m a i n four
churches, the private sector and c i v i l society organizations.
While the development o f the PRSP and this C A S were based o n a broad, participatory process, the challenge
n o w lies in the implementation o f the Govemment’s strategy and a concerted effort for poverty reduction and
economic growth in Madagascar. As part o f i t s ongoing work, the donor community will continue to work
closely together o n the ground to best target and implement their support in line w i t h comparative advantage.
(See donor activity matrix in Appendix 5) Local donor meetings are held regularly and dialogue o n a project by
project basis also takes place w i t h local communities.
U p o n request o f the Government, a donor coordination meeting, f o l l o w i n g up o n the successful Friends o f
Madagascar meeting h e l d in July 2002, in Paris in October 2003 focuses on p r i o r i t y themes l a i d out in the
PRSP: Governance and the Macroeconomic situation, Transport and Rural Development, and Education t o
share latest information, r e f o r m measures and sector approach between the Government and the donor
community .

35

Appendix 7. Policy actions required before approving a PRSC
In particular, and before approving a PRSC, the Bank will assess progress in the following areas:
the functioning o f the financial reform commission;
the implementation o f the recommendations o f the audit o f the treasury;
the revision o f laws pertaining to financial management
the strengthening o f internal controls
the adoption o f a n e w procurement code
the strengthening o f procurement capacity in key spending ministries
the improvement in the operations o f commercial courts
adequacy o f internal controls in the justice department
the restructuring o f customs so as to reduce corruption and to accelerate clearing procedures,

If the Bank judges that these areas are not met, the Bank will revert to traditional project lending and will
thus be in the l o w case (See page 23).

Appendix 10. Key requirements for moving to higher growth rates, increased poverty
reduction and higher aid inflows
The Bank believes that six points are fundamental to reach these higher levels o f poverty reduction and
growth. These points will be monitored closely:
Ensure that growth poles beneJit the poor: Most important for the above scenario to materialize i s
that future growth in Madagascar benefits the poor more than in the past. The most recent growth
period (1 997-2001) was centered around growth in resource extraction sectors like mining and
fishing (with relatively l o w spread effects) as well as manufacturing (with significant employment
impacts), construction, services, and tourism. For growth to be broader based than in the past, both
public investments (irrigation, roads and general transport infrastructure, education, health) would
need to concentrate on poor but high-potential rural areas. Apart from manufacturing investments,
private sector funds would increasingly have to also benefit ago-businesses which have, according
to a number o f studies, a good profitability potential if complementary public investments in
infrastructure were present;
Improve environment for private investors. The most important current hindrances for private
investment are (i)
a very concentrated banking sector which limits availability o f credit (with banks
holding excess liquidity in either treasury bonds or as simple deposits with the Central Bank); (ii)
limited availability o f secure land for property investments; (iii)
discretionary and corrupt customs
practices including long waiting times to ex- and import goods; (iv) a slow and ineffective judicial
sector which does not help secure and protect property rights o f private investors; and (v) significant
public sector arrears towards the private sector. Further, public sector procurement policies are
open but irregularities in awarding bids occurs and the recent country procurement review suggested
.
a major overhaul o f govemment procurement regulation.
Achieve More Effective Resource Use of Domestic and Foreign Resources: Only if resource use
becomes more effective and efficient, could increased foreign and domestic resources contribute to
a significantly improved poverty impact o f public spending. Major reforms are needed with respect
to budget planning, execution and reporting. The recent budgetary process assessments within the
HIPC initiative and the C F A A showed that Madagascar only meets five out o f fifteen specified
budget management benchmarks with serious weaknesses in execution and reporting but also major
problems in budget formulation. The major weaknesses include that (i)
budget planning i s s t i l l
conducted separately for current and investment expenditures leading to important misalignments
for investment implementation (planning o f counterpart fund use) but also for proper planning o f
maintenance and staff expenditures; (ii)
the link between overall poverty reduction strategy and
public investment distribution i s historically very weak; (iii)
the expenditure chain i s long and
cumbersome with too many and ineffective controls, leading to underutilization o f credit lines,
especially for investments in social sectors; (iv) the monitoring system o f current expenditures i s
only able to track expenditure until the commitment stage, resulting in a budget system that i s
largely treasury-determined (as treasury decides which bills to pay and which ones not); and that (v)
n o functioning reporting and monitoring system for investment expenditures exists (as these are
largely donor financed and projects to do regularize expenditures ex post). Similarly, a public
sector procurement reform i s needed as a recent Country Procurement Assessment revealed.
Currently, public procurement takes very long and not transparent. Procurement reform could
significantly increase public investment execution rates as well as provide important higher demand
for private sector contractors;
Implement Service Delivev, Institutional Development and Fight Against Corruption. Significant
reforms would also be necessary to improve service delivery in key sectors (education, health,
agriculture, transport, water). Apart from the general public financial management and budget
planning problems outlined above (which concern all sectors alike), the necessary steps would

39

include (i)
significant legal and financial strengthening o f communities (including additional tax
authority to finance maintenance expenditures o f primary facilities); (ii)
institutional strengthening
and concerted capacity building efforts at the level o f the communes aimed at improving the
improved accountability and control systems within the deconcentrated
delivery o f services; (iii)
service delivery ministries. Most likely, increased absorptive capacity within sector ministries can
only be achieved in the short-run through contracting out o f service delivery to NGOs and churches.
The n e w Govemment has also declared a ‘war on corruption’ and a superior council to fight
corruption has been formed.

(5)

Increase domestic revenues: Currently, with around 10 percent o f GDP (2001), Madagascar has
one o f the lowest tax/GDP ratios for i t s per capita income with the largest part o f taxes stemming
from customs receipts (46 percent) and the value added tax (43 percent). During the crisis year
2002, the tax ratio even dropped to 7.3 percent. While customs reform might increase revenue
collection, further planned liberalization would likely not leave room to increase trade tax income.
Rather, income tax collection would need to improve significantly. Such a rise might not be
advisable in the very short-run when the economy i s struggling to recover from an economic crisis
but medium-term fiscal plans should include such a higher tax collection. Customs administration
i s key as collection remains weak. Current customs administration hinders private sector activities
and effective revenue collection: a computerized customs data system i s in place but not effectively
used; customs bureaucracy and corruption are high. A new pre-shipment control contract has been
signed but deeper reforms (including the contracting out o f customs) would need to be concretized.
