EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Argentina continues i t s rapid recovery from the economic and social crisis o f 2001-2002.

. Effective macroeconomic management, focused on the generation o f primary fiscal surpluses,

has helped to establish three years o f fast and pro-poor growth. Poverty and unemployment,
while still high, have fallen substantially from the peaks during the crisis. Progress has been
evident throughout the economy. On the political front, President Kirchner further consolidated
his buoyant popular support in the legislative elections o f October 2005.
The four years since the depth o f the crisis have seen the outlines o f a new development agenda
emerge in Argentina, and the substantial rejection o f that which predominated in the 1990s. The
past two Governments have reacted to long standing social and economic problems that were
exacerbated, and brought to the fore, by the crisis, such as structural poverty, inequality and deep
social exclusion. While progress has been made toward establishing a clearly defined policy
framework in certain sectors (health and education), such progress has yet to be achieved in other
important sectors, most notably, public services.
The current environment presents Argentina with important opportunities, but also risks. The
opportunity i s to translate the fast recovery and current political stability into sustainable
economic and social development for the long term. This would represent a significant break
with the country’s history o f slow growth, recurrent crisis and increasing social exclusion.
Continued prudent macroeconomic management will require, inter alia, sustained fiscal
discipline at the federal and provincial levels. Equally important i s a commitment to structural
reform, including in investment climate, institutional strengthening, the rule o f law, and public
services, Argentina can continue to build o n the progress achieved in key social areas o f poverty
reduction and social inclusion. The risks o f not tackling these challenges could weaken the
recovery and undermine Argentina’s social and economic development for the long term.
The objective o f the new IBRD-IFC Joint CAS i s to seek opportunities to build an investment
partnership to support Government efforts to transition from crisis recovery to sustained, private
sector-led growth with improved equity and reduced structural poverty. A successhl transition
requires a long-term development strategy incorporating feasible policies to reduce social
exclusion and strengthen governance. The three pillars o f the 2004 CAS-sustained growth with
equity, social inclusion and improved governance-remain valid and provide the foundation for
the new CAS. The IFC i s prepared to complement support from IBRD by providing long-term
financing and structured finance products to companies and projects in strategic sectors, with an
emphasis on groups expanding on a South-South basis and export-oriented or export facilitating
projects. IFC’s ability to support private sector engagement in infrastructure and public services
projects will depend on the adoption o f a clear and stable policy framework restoring the
conditions for private sector participation in infrastructure both in terms o f existing and future
investments in this area.
Supporting medium-term development goals will continue to challenge the Bank as long as
Argentina’s reform commitment remains uncertain. In 2004, the Bank addressed this uncertainty
by, on an exceptional basis, truncating the CAS from 5 years to,20 months and conducting a
structural review with the Government (on which staff briefed the Board in June 2004). The
CAS incorporates the key lessons from the 2004 CAS. First, the limited policy dialogue with the
i

Government and the lack o f an active IMF program have made it difficult to sustain policy based
lending and thereby the envisaged level o f resources. Second, the shift to investment lending has
increased the emphasis on performance and underlined the challenge o f strengthening the
Government’s project implementation capacity. Third, while the basis for investment lending
has been laid in several key areas, achieving a hll-fledged investment partnership requires a
longer time horizon than the truncated 2004 CAS.
The assistance strategy reflects constructive consultations with the Government, and builds on
the extensive consultation held in preparation for the 2004 CAS. The 2004 CAS presented an
approach whereby the Bank would seek to engage in active dialogue, and, where there was
consensus, proceed to lending operations; where consensus was pending, the Bank would seek to
maintain engagement, including through analytical work. The CAS maintains this approach,
with substantial new lending planned for roads, health, income support for the poor, and public
sector strengthening. Dialogue with civil society and the private sector has been very productive,
including a Development Marketplace o n Youth and Values held in Buenos Aires in mid 2005
and economic work on the dynamic relationship between growth, poverty and equity.
The CAS covers three years (2006 to 2008) and presents a base case o f US$3.3 billion
exclusively for investment operations. This scenario is appropriate provided macroeconomic
stability continues. Should the Government request policy based lending and establish adequate
conditions (including a satisfactory macro framework), up to 25 percent o f the base-case
envelope could be reallocated to policy based loans. A range o f l o w cases i s also possible if
macroeconomic policies were to deteriorate, growth falter, and portfolio management weaken.
A CAS progress report will be prepared mid-way through the CAS period. Moreover,
management proposes to provide periodic briefings to the Board o n ongoing economic
developments and the medium t e r m outlook.
This i s a performance based CAS that confirms the emphasis on concrete government action
established under the 2004 CAS. I t formalizes the transition by the Bank from the coordinated
effort to maintain exposure o f the I F I s while Argentina recovered from the crisis. The shift to
100 percent investment lending highlights the challenge for the Government to significantly
increase i t s implementation capacity, which i s s t i l l being rebuilt after the crisis. This investment
based approach has implications for Bank exposure, which fell to US$6.9 billion by end-2005,
compared to US$7.5 billion at end-2003, when the 2004 CAS was prepared.

The CAS includes concrete measures to help strengthen the operating environment for Bank
projects, A fiduciary action plan will promote public awareness, enhance Bank supervision, and
ensure more transparent and competitive procurement. The Bank i s engaging the authorities to
address fiduciary concerns in specific areas where weaknesses have been identified and
increasing supervision resources for operations at risk. The CAS includes assistance to bolster
project management. TKe broader emphasis on strengthening governance puts the Bank’s efforts
into a strategic context.
Argentina presents exceptional challenges to effective Bank support. A number o f important
risks must be acknowledged. Concerns regarding fiduciary management, a lack o f engagement
on structural issues (including investment climate and private sector participation), and a slowing

..

11

o f the economy are important risks for which mitigating measures, including lending triggers,
have been incorporated into the CAS.

Executive Directors may wish to discuss, among other things, whether the assistance strategy
correctly incorporates the lessons learned from the 2004 CAS and strikes the right balance
between pursuing opportunities and mitigating risks.

I.INTRODUCTION
A.

Overview

1.
Argentina’s recovery from the economic and social crisis o f 2001-02, one o f the most
severe losses o f income and downturns in living standards on record, has been impressive. After
three years o f fast growth, GDP in 2005 reached the pre-crisis peak o f 1998, with per capita
output expected t o recover to peak levels in 2006. Export earnings are higher, tax revenues have
increased substantially, fiscal accounts are in surplus, and the Government has restructured three
quarters o f i t s debt in default. The recovery has been pro-poor. Poverty has been cut markedly
from the depths of the crisis, but s t i l l remains above the level prior to the onset o f the recession
in 1998. Unemployment has also fallen. Although informality remains widespread, formal
employment is rebounding, with j o b growth in the formal sector beginning to outpace jobs in the
informal sector. Inequality, which has been on a long-term upward trend in Argentina, was
exacerbated by the crisis and has yet to show a substantial response to the recovery. The social
advances during the recovery have been from a low starting point and large segments o f the
population continue to face great hardship.
2.
The challenge for Argentina i s to build on the strong recovery to establish the foundation
for sustainable, more equitably shared private sector-led economic growth over the medium
term. This would represent a significant break with Argentina’s history o f protracted slow
growth, recurring periods o f crisis and increasing social exclusion. Prudent macroeconomic
policies have played a central role in the recovery. A successful transition to sustained growth
will require, in addition to continued prudent macroeconomic management, a combination o f
longer-term strategy and pro-active policies to promote private investment, expand social
inclusion to tackle growing problems o f structural poverty and excluded populations, and
strengthen governance under a sound institutional framework. The window for policy action i s
not open-ended. After remaining subdued in 2003-04, inflation accelerated to double digits in
2005. Many o f the factors that have contributed to the recovery-the normal and transitory
effects of a rebound from crisis-are reaching their natural limit. The largely benign external
environment that has prevailed in the international economy over recent years cannot be counted
on to be sustained.
3.
Argentina’s long-term interests will be well served by the development o f a longer termstrategy and policy framework that i s supported by strong institutions. The outline o f a new
development agenda has emerged in recent years in which the Government i s assuming a more
proactive role in addressing long-standing issues o f poverty and social exclusion, problems
which are perceived to have been exacerbated by the policies o f the 1990s. Since the crisis, the
Government has taken direct action in two areas. First, emergency social transfer programs for
the poor have been extended to a significant proportion o f the entire population. Second, the
state has become much more directly involved in decisions affecting the provision of
infrastructure and public services, including the control o f tariffs and investments to increase
access. While progress has been made toward establishing a credible policy framework in
certain sectors (health and education), such progress has yet to be achieved in other important
sectors, most notably, public services.

4.
The m a i n objective o f the IBRD-IFC Joint CAS i s to seek opportunities to build an
investment partnership to support Government efforts to make the transition from emergency
response and crisis recovery, with an emphasis on reducing the extent and severity o f poverty, to
sustained growth with improved equity and reductions in structural poverty and an appropriate
policy framework for private sector development. The three pillars o f the 2004 CAS' sustained growth with equity, social inclusion and improved governance-remain valid, in fact
even more so as the country shifts from a focus on crisis response to medium-term growth. In
terms o f operationalizing the strategy, the Bank's approach, as i t was under the 2004 CAS, will
continue to be opportunistic in terms o f actively searching for areas o f consensus with the
Government, and then developing these areas through knowledge and lending work.
5.
The IFC proposes to complement I B R D ' s strategy in Argentina by providing long term
financing and structured financial products to companies and projects in strategic sectors, with an
emphasis o n groups expanding on a South-South basis and to export-oriented or export
facilitating projects. The IFC will focus on a number o f key criteria when considering new
projects, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability, as well as the track
record with respect to honoring contractual obligations. Strategic sectors include oil, gas and
mining, agribusiness and forestry products; and the financial sector, with an emphasis on high
impact projects such as housing and support o f export oriented small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs). The I F C will also consider on a selective basis projects in other high impact
areas, including the social sector and financial restructuring. While there i s a compelling need
for investments in the utilities sector to support capacity expansion and growth, I F C does not
expect to be active in this area until there i s satisfactory progress on the renegotiation o f public
service contracts, the adoption o f a clear and stable policy framework, and the establishment o f
appropriate conditions for private sector participation.

6.
A strong and active partnership between Argentina and the international community,
including the multilateral financial institutions, can help ensure a successful transition to
sustained growth with equity. Inthis context, the CAS emphasizes:

A.

Political Context

7.
The Kirchner Administration has by and large maintained the broad popular support i t
enjoyed at the time of the presentation o f the previous CAS, in April 2004, when it was
approaching completion of its first year in office. Strong economic growth, the promising
recovery in social conditions, progress towards restructuring o f the public debt, movement on
historically sensitive domestic political issues such as human rights, and an assertive stand with
respect to international creditors and holders o f public services concessions, as well as in
multilateral fora, have contributed to the administration’s continued popularity. The President’s
party recorded a solid victory in the congressional election o f October 2005. The victory
included Buenos Aires province, which was considered the critical battleground as the nation’s
most populous and economically important province. This was the first electoral contest for the
Administration since i t took office in M a y 2003, and President Kirchner stated publicly before
the election that he viewed the vote as a major test o f his governing stance. Presidential elections
are next scheduled for 2007.

8,
The Government nevertheless faces important political and social challenges, including
restoring citizen trust in governance. There is a notable consensus o f findings from public
surveys and analytic studies undertaken by domestic and international organizations indicating
the degree to which the crisis undermined confidence in public institutions.
B.

Economic and Social Context

9.
After three years o f fast growth (averaging approximately 9 percent during 2003-05),
GDP has recovered to, and in fact surpassed, the pre-crisis peak o f 1998 (Figure 1.a). The
Argentine crisis was deeper than other recent crisis episodes (Figure 1.b). Per capita GDP as
measured in Argentine pesos (Figure 1.c) i s projected to recover to i t s pre-crisis peak in 2006.
Nevertheless, per capita GDP in U S dollars has declined to less than one h a l f the levels reached
prior to the crisis, to an estimated US$4,500 in 2005 (Figure lad),largely as a result o f the
massive currency depreciation.
10.
The Government’s macroeconomic policies have played a central role in the rapid
economic recovery, leading to improved competitiveness and confidence levels which have
underpinned increases in exports, investment and consumer spending. Other factors which have
contributed to the strength o f the recovery include the typical rebound effect, which was
magnified by the exceptional depth o f the crisis that left the economy with substantial excess
productive capacity and record high unemployment, and a generally favorable external
environment.

Macroeconomic policy since 2003 has emphasized tight fiscal discipline, improved
external competitiveness and a rebuilding o f international reserves (Table 1). The Federal
Government recorded a primary surplus o f 2.3 percent o f GDP in 2003, 3.9 percent in 2004, and
an estimated 3.7 percent in 2005. At the provincial level, a primary surplus o f 0.7 percent of
GDP was achieved in 2003, increasing to 0.9 percent in 2004, and is estimated at 0.5 percent in
2005. Inflation remained well under control in 2003-04, despite the massive devaluation during
the crisis, although price pressures reemerged in 2005 with inflation reaching 12.3 percent by the
end o f the year. The exchange rate was maintained in a narrow range around AR$2.9 to the US
dollar through most o f 2005, and i s now trading in a range o f about AR$3.05 to the U S dollar.
The devaluation o f the Peso has helped restore competitiveness, underpinned a sharp turnaround
in the trade balance, and supported a build up o f international reserves. Another important factor
in the reserve buildup was the suspension o f most public debt service payments between
December 2001 when the sovereign default was announced and June 2005 when the debt

4

exchange covering about three-quarters o f this debt was completed. In early January 2006,
Argentina prepaid 100 percent o f i t s obligations to the IMF o f SDR 6.7 billion (US$9.7 billion)
which reduced international reserves from approximately US$28 billion to US$18.5 billion. The
Government has since pursued a strategy to restore these reserves, which by February had
already surpassed US$20 billion with active Central Bank intervention.

The currency depreciation o f 2002, the improvement in the terms o f trade and the
reduction in wages restored Argentina’s competitiveness (Figure 2.a). The result, as was to be
expected, was an increase in net exports (6 percent in 2002), reflecting, by and large, a sharp
decline in imports. This rise in net exports boosted growth in the initial phase o f the recovery.
After this initial spark, consumption spending started to expand, leading to a demand led
recovery (Figure 2.b). The recovery in domestic demand generated a rebound in merchandise
imports following the crisis-induced collapse in 2002. This rebound in imports has reduced the
surplus o f current account o f the balance o f payments; after peaking at a surplus o f some 8.5
percent o f GDP in 2002, the current account surplus i s estimated to have declined to the range o f

5

2-3 percent o f GDP in 2004-05 (Figure 2.c). In parallel, exports have continued to grow, with
merchandise exports almost 50 percent higher in US dollar terms in 2005 than they were before
the crisis.

The recovery has been characterized by a qualitative change in the structure o f the
economy and the allocation o f resources. The currency depreciation was favorable to tradeable
sectors, notably manufacturing. In addition, the reduction in labor costs that accompanied the
currency devaluation and the recovery in domestic demand fueled growth in construction and
retail sectors, These sectors, which have led the recovery, have been labor-absorbing (Figure
2.d). They have also been more intensive in the utilization o f less skilled workers than the
sectors that were the most dynamic in the 1990s; the growth pattern o f the 1990s relied more
heavily on higher skilled workers, for example, in financial services.

6

14.
The pattern of economic recovery has resulted in growth that has been pro-poor in that
incomes o f the poor have generally grown faster during the upturn than the average for the
population as a whole. As the sectors leading the recovery have employed more workers,
unemployment rates have declined. Given the relatively high demand o f low-skilled, often poor,
workers, the recovery has also contributed to a downturn in the levels o f poverty and inequality
from the historical peaks reached during the crisis. Unemployment fell to 11.4 percent (counting
Jefes program beneficiaries that are participating in workfare and searching for employment as
unemployed) as of the fourth quarter o f 2005 (Figure 3.a). Significantly, unemployment i s now
on par with the level observed in 1998. The urban poverty rate dropped to 33.8 percent by the
second half o f 2005, down from 48 percent observed in 2003 (Figure 3.b), but well above the
level prior to the recession. Data on inequality t e l l a similar story.

The reduction in poverty during the recovery has been accompanied by improvements in
broader social outcomes. Box 1 provides an update o f the poverty characteristics table presented
in the 2004 CAS, tracking the evolution o f key social development indicators between 2002 and
today, Very importantly, the rise in infant mortality witnessed during the crisis (a first in several
decades in Argentina) has been reversed, dropping significantly from 16.8 per thousand l i f e
births in 2002 to 14.4 in 2005. Health insurance coverage o f the social security system i s slowly
rising again in parallel with the increase in formal sector jobs. Completion rates in secondary
school are on the rise; though remain l o w in absolute terms at only 61.5 percent. However, large
segments o f the population continue to face great hardship and vulnerability. Children are at
high risk o f poverty and youth are at high risk o f unemployment when compared to other groups
in society; the poverty rate o f children is still 20 percent higher and the youth unemployment rate
i s 13 percentage points higher than the respective national averages.

111. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

17.
When President Kirchner took office in M a y 2003 he outlined the principal goals o f his
administration in an address to the National Assembly. H e stressed the need for continued
economic stability with sustained growth in the order o f 4-5 percent such that would generate
employment and enable real incomes to double in the space o f fifteen years. Mindful that the
2001 government default on public debt was the result o f excessive borrowing and faulty
economic management, he pledged to follow prudent fiscal policies that would secure fiscal
surplus on a consistent basis. In that context, special mention was made o f the need for tax
reforms that would broaden the tax base, reduce special exemptions and increase tax collection.
18.
At the same time, he envisaged a strong government role in guiding economic growth
within a context o f “national capitalism ”. Government would participate actively in the
provision o f infrastructure, broadly defined to include housing as well as health and education
facilities. Social services would be upgraded with the objective o f increasing both coverage and
quality. And measures would be taken to address the corruption o f the 1990s. However, while
acknowledging the need for a robust social safety net, President Kirchner was quite explicit in
stating that “the problems of poverty cannot be solved by social policies but rather by economic
policies ”. The Government has been consistent in i t s pursuit o f these goals and articulate in their
elaboration in successive official documents and public speeches, including in the authorities’
development vision described in Annex A o f this CAS.
19.
A little more than a year after taking office, in June 2004, the Government submitted to
the Bank (as part of the Economic Recovery Support Loan2), the Administration’s development
agenda, After a lengthy and comprehensive criticism o f the policies pursued during the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~
the document, in a section called “Guidelines o f the long term scenario”, describes a vision very
much in line with that set out to the National Assembly. The Argentine economy would be
based on fiscal discipline and exchange rate competitiveness to achieve broader based growth.
This growth, the document stated, would result in a “new configuration o f relative prices that
would enable strengthening o f advances already observed.. .in the labor market, and., .in other
social indicators”. As has in fact happened, the Administration anticipated that this new scenario
would contribute to more labor intensive production and a broader distribution o f income.
20.
Three months later, the Government reiterated these principles in the prospectus for i t s
debt restructuring offer, which it submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission in September 2004.3 It stated that the main goals o f the Administration’s economic
program are as follows.

To increase spending on social programs and investments in public infrastructure.
To restructure Argentina’s public debt and to achieve fiscal discipline at the federal and
provincial levels with the goal o f achieving sustainable debt service obligations.
To implement tax reform measures designed to deter tax evasion.
To reform the social security system.

T o reach a sustainable revenue sharing system with the provinces.
T o increase lending by strengthening the stability o f the financial system; phasing out o f
certain bank regulations implemented during the economic crisis and conducting audits
and strategic reviews o f the leading public banks to ensure their efficiency.
To increase the Central Bank’s independence, while increasing i t s accountability in the
supervision o f the financial sector.
T o implement an inflation-targeting monitoring system.
To attract private investment by creating a predictable and efficient legal framework to
restructure corporate debts.

21,
The Administration has in fact pursued many o f these economic goals, although in a way
consistent with i t s overarching principles o f an assertive role for government and an emphasis on
social considerations. With respect to attracting investment, for example, the President
frequently reiterates that Argentina needs infrastructure investment, but that such investment
must be different in nature and result than the investment patterns o f the 1990s, and, as h e said
recently, have a “clear Keynesian and heterodoxy4 vision that generates growth, employment,
social inclusion and equity.
22.
The Administration has been similarly consistent in the area o f social policy, Beginning
in M a y 30, 2005, in marking i t s first two years in office, the Kirchner administration began
outlining publicly a set o f ambitious goals, with clear and measurable targets, to be reached at the
end o f its first t e r m in 2007. Chief among these goals i s to reduce unemployment and p ~ v e r t y . ~
To reach these goals, President Kirchner has identified housing construction and improving the
quality o f education as two key initiatives; he has also focused on the challenges for youth,
particularly with respect to the high poverty rate among youth. Toward this end, the President
has publicly called for broad reforms and new funding for education and technical training. In
October, he submitted a proposal to Congress that called for lengthening the school day,
eliminating illiteracy and increasing the accessibility o f computers and technology. The proposal
also calls for a substantial increase in funding, with funds allocated by federal and provincial
governments to education, science and technology to rise from 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 6
percent by 2010.
23.
In the area o f governance, the Kirchner Administration has prepared preliminary
proposals for improved public sector management, including in 2004, a publication by the
Ministry o f Economy and Production, “Argentina 21: Argentina Facing the 21st Century”
This document contains a vision o f the state intended to make the country compete and grow in
the global economy o f the 2 1st century. I t aims at improving the governance and the investment
climate by strengthening linkages between the public and private sector, public and private
investment and reducing barriers to investment. Emphasizing increased coordination between
levels o f government for improved public expenditure management, it focuses on promoting

regional growth through the design o f a policy on so-called territorial economic development to
stimulate local economic development at the municipal and provincial levels.

24.
A concise version o f the authorities’ development vision i s also included in Annex A o f
this CAS: “Economic Policy Guidelines”. In it, the Government restates the principles and
priorities that i t has identified over the past three years, and underscores the goal o f promoting a
strong state to foster equitable and inclusive development based o n employment. T o reach this
goal, the document sets out a comprehensive agenda built o n promoting investment,
strengthening competitiveness, and revitalizing public institutions, including ensuring the
stability o f the “rules o f the game” to promote the private sector. The Government identifies key
challenges as ensuring adequate energy supplies, lowering inflation, strengthening the country’s
ability to withstand external volatility, and consolidating the social recovery.

12

IV. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES: R I S K S AND OPPORTUNITIES
25.
The rapid recovery since the crisis provides Argentina with the opportunity to break with
i t s history o f l o w growth and volatility to begin to reverse long-term trends o f growing structural
poverty and inequality. Seizing this opportunity will require determined action across a range o f
development challenges under the three pillars o f equitable growth, social inclusion, and
improved governance that form the basis o f both the previous and the new CAS.

A.

Sustainable Growth

Achieving high growth over the medium term i s a serious challenge for Argentina given
i t s historical track record. While the fast growth over the past three years has helped to recover
the ground lost during the crisis, Argentina's growth over the past 30 years has remained
stagnant. After peaking in 1974-80, per capita GDP declined by 22 percent during the 1980s,
increased by 42 percent through 1998, declined by 22 percent through 2002, and recovered
following the crisis. All in all, per capita GDP in 2004 was about the same level as in 1974
(Figure 5.a), although it i s now close to the peak level recorded in 1998.

A recently completed Bank study on sustained growth with social equity7, prepared in
close cooperation with the authorities, presents a selected set o f government policies that have
been found to be effective in delivering high growth. The report also examines their likely effect
on poverty and inequality in Argentina. The pro-growth policies discussed in the study
infrastructure
encompass: (i)fiscal policy as a cornerstone o f macroeconomic stability, (ii)
investment to address existing and potential bottlenecks to expanded economic activity and
exports, (iii)
private sector development to ensure a more favorable environment and attain a
more competitive position, (iv) trade policies centered on creating new trade opportunities for

' Argentina - Seeking Sustained Growth and Social Equity, Report No. 32553-AR, October 21,2005.

Argentina including in agriculture, and (v) education policies to build the skilled labor force
needed for tomorrow's economy. Determined action on these policy fronts would help underpin
the improved competitiveness following the 2002 devaluation and support the transition from
economic recovery to sustained and equitable growth over the medium term.

28.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Medium-term macroeconomic stability hinges on
the continuation o f a sound fiscal position centered on sustained primary fiscal surpluses. This
would represent a major change for Argentina. Between 1965 and 2001, the average primary
fiscal balance on a consolidated basis (including the provinces) as a percentage o f GDP was
negative 2.4 percent, and the overall balance was negative 4.6 percent. Fiscal deficits
contributed substantially to macroeconomic instability in the past, as evidenced by Argentina's
experience with hyper-inflation and boom-bust cycles (Figure 5 .b) which have consistently hurt
the poor and led to a ratcheting up o f the poverty rate (para. 40).

Sustaining primary surpluses over the medium term i s in line the Government’s policy o f
fiscal discipline and will help underpin i t s objective o f maintaining a competitive exchange rate.
Since the 2001-02 crisis, fiscal performance has been solid both at the federal and provincial
levels (Figure 6.a and Figure 6.b). A continuation o f this strong fiscal performance will help
contain the inflationary pressures that emerged in 2005 (Figure 6.c) which, in the context o f a
broadly stable Peso, can result in pressure on the real exchange rate to appreciate. Prudent
macroeconomic policies centered on sustained primary surpluses, and targeting l o w and stable
inflation as well as the maintenance o f external competitiveness, will support debt sustainability
as the country emerges from default (Figure 6.d). Primary surpluses are not only important to
ensure that public debt declines as a percentage o f GDP in the long term, but also as a financing
source in the medium term. The Government faces significant medium-term debt servicing
requirements, despite the reduction in the public debt following the debt exchange completed in
June 2005 and the early repayment to the IMF completed in January 2006 (Annex B).

30.
The improvements in fiscal performance have been achieved through a combination o f
improved tax administration and the introduction o f specific export and financial transaction
taxes in response to the crisis. Tax revenues have increased across the full range o f tax
instruments, from income taxes to VAT (Figure 7.a). However, the export tax and the financial
transactions tax have played a key role in the large primary surpluses recorded since 2003. The
nature o f these taxes can have negative effects on growth, as they constrain the development o f
the financial system and discourage investment in export sectors. The resources obtained from
the export tax depend on the degree o f external competitiveness and developments in
international commodity prices. Were relative prices to change, the result could put pressure on
export tax revenues. Medium-tern macroeconomic stability would be greatly enhanced were the
Government to work towards to a strategy for reducing the dependence o f fiscal performance on
export and financial transactions taxes.

Federal and provincial governments have exercised discipline on the expenditure side as
well, though primary expenditures have grown significantly since 2002 (Figure 7.b). Containing
expenditures in the future may prove challenging. The Government is facing strong pressures
for wage and pension increases, a factor that i s compounded by the reemergence o f inflation.
Also, the Government will need to ensure the fiscal space to accommodate planned increases in
capital expenditures, in particular for public housing infrastructure. The case o f Buenos Aires
province, which according to preliminary data ran a small primary deficit in 2005 generated in
large part by higher public sector wages, illustrates the nascent resurfacing o f spending pressures
at the provincial level.

combination o f higher investment and steady productivity growth. Achieving medium t e r m

16

growth rates o n the order o f 3 percent per year would require investment rates in the 20-22
percent range, assuming total factor productivity (TFP) grows at about 1 percent per year. W h i l e
higher TFP increases have been achieved in the past, zero, or even negative, TFP increases can
not be disregarded as a possibility either, as these have also been observed through prolonged
periods (Figure 8.a). Most dynamic sectors through the recovery period are already operating at
near full productive capacity (Figure 8.b). Investment has recovered significantly since the crisis
to an estimated level o f about 21.5 percent o f GDP in 2005; however, real investment, that is,
investment measured in physical units, still remains below the peak o f the 1990s (Figure 8.c). A t
1993 prices, estimated investment in 2005 was about 20 percent o f GDP, which is lower than the
peak o f over 21 percent in 1998. Argentina’s current investment level i s converging to that o f
other Latin-American countries (Figure 8.d).
CZosing the infrastructure gap. I t has long been recognized that an adequate supply o f
33.
infrastructure services is an essential ingredient for productivity and widely shared growth.
Argentina’s history, however, suggests that underinvestment in infrastructure has contributed to
the opposite outcome-slowing
growth and increasing poverty and marginalization. In the
1 9 8 0 public
~~
investment in infrastructure (defined as water and sanitation, transport, energy and
telecommunications) averaged around 3 percent o f GDP. During the 1990s this fell to about
one-half o f one percent, and by 2000 to one-quarter o f one percent. This collapse in public
investment was only partially offset by private sector investment, which amounted to about 1.2
percent of GDP during this period (and o f this over half went to telecommunications), leaving
total investment in infrastructure at about 2 percent o f GDP. The impact on Argentina’s
competitiveness has been substantial. Logistics costs, for example, are estimated to be the
second highest in Latin America and nearly three times higher than the OECD average. Recent
analysis’ suggests that improving infrastructure stocks to the level o f the regional leader (Costa
Rica) could result in an increase in the GDP growth rate o f 1.3 percentage points; improving
stocks and performance to the East Asian median could add 3 percentage points to annual
growth, The same study finds that it would have a similarly marked effect o n poverty; the
impact for Argentina o f improving i t s infrastructure performance to the level o f Costa Rica
would be a reduction o f i t s Gini coefficient by 0.04.

34.
Fundamental issues remain to be addressed to meet the investment challenge. The
Government has taken steps to increase investment through real capital expenditures (largely
allocated to infrastructure and public housing), and plans to continue to increase public
investment in the future. However, private investment in specific infrastructure and public
services sectors, especially those that expand installed capacity (e.g., electricity and gas), has not
been sufficient to meet the requirements o f growing domestic demand and to sustain growth in
the medium and long term. Concrete measures to restore the incentive framework for private
investment in infrastructure and public services will be crucial, including completing
renegotiations o f public service, re-establishing an appropriate regulatory framework, and
diversifying the export base in both agricultural and other markets. In addition to the level o f
investment, the historical trends in total factor productivity highlight the need for action to
ensure the quality o f investment and the efficiency o f resource allocation in general. This points

helps align relative prices with underlying costs.
Restoring financial intermediation. While progress has been made in revitalizing the
35,
financial sector, which was devastated by the crisis, further strengthening i s necessary for the
sector to order to play an effective financial intermediation role. The banking sector has
recovered significantly since the crisis; deposits have been growing, bank profitability i s up and
capital increases are helping to improve solvency. The Government has eliminated withdrawal
restrictions and has, to a large extent, completed the compensation to the banks for policy
induced losses. Banking regulation and supervision are returning gradually to international
standards. Consumer and commercial credit i s recovering, while asset quality has improved
significantly. However, credit to the private sector i s s t i l l equivalent to only 10 percent o f GDP
and the supply o f long-term credit remains low. Argentina can help complete the recovery o f the
financial sector by strengthening the legal and regulatory environment to improve contract
enforcement and creditors rights, and developing an institutional environment conducive to a
climate of trust in financial intermediation (Annex C).

initiatives have been launched, a more concerted,
broad-based strategy i s required to improve the
productivity, quality and product m i x o f Argentine exports; increase productive innovations;
promote supply chain integration; stimulate linkages between large companies and small and
medium enterprises (SMEs); and increase investment in R&D and innovation. Perhaps most
important, substantial gains could be realized through determined policy efforts to expand human
capital through formal education and lifelong learning (Annex D).

37.

Re-establishing a framework for publicbrivate partnership infrastructure and public
services, The Government has taken steps to address certain basic infrastructure needs, such as
road maintenance, but substantial new investment i s needed to expand the capacity o f energy,

18

transport, water and sanitation networks in order to avoid the emergence o f growth bottlenecks.
Infrastructure investment, by both the public and private sector, declined precipitously during the
recession in the late 1990s and then all but collapsed during the crisis. While public investment
has more than doubled since 2002, reaching 1.5 percent o f GDP in 2004, constraints on fiscal
space and the Government’s implementation capacity indicate that the role o f the private sector
remains crucial. However, the private sector’s participation in new investments in infrastructure
has been limited. Pending issues and delays in the renegotiation o f public service and
infrastructure concessions are undermining the incentives for broader private sector participation
(Annex E). The Government’s decision in December to extend the emergency law through 2006
delays further the re-establishment o f a functioning regulatory framework for public services and
infrastructure.
Developing extractive industries. The challenge o f establishing an adequate legal and
3 8.
regulatory framework is exemplified by the contrasting situations in the energy and mining
sectors. Although Argentina has large natural gas reserves (the fourth largest in the region) the
country has experienced gas shortages since 2004. Price controls imposed during the crisis have
kept prices low, promoting an increase in energy demand, outstripping supply. Argentina
reduced gas exports to Chile, initiated domestic rationing, and began importing gas from Bolivia.
The Government undertook measures to stimulate production, including establishing a new state
energy company, incentives for investment in downstream infrastructure, and plans to eventually
liberalize energy prices. However, these partial measures have not led to increased production.
Industry analysts believe that increasing domestic natural gas supply will require more structural
changes, notably reducing government intervention with a view to restoring a financially viable
environment with long-term predictable rules. In the meantime, Argentina i s expected to
become increasingly dependent on external gas supply. The development o f the mining sector,
on the other hand, has benefited from a stable legal framework supportive o f private investment.
Mining legislation, for example, allows investors to apply for special benefits, including 30-year
stability in taxes on investments; duty-free imports o f machinery, spare parts and mining inputs;
tax deductions and ‘value-added tax refunds on exploration investments; and a 3 percent cap on
provincial mining royalties. These incentives, combined with rising metal prices and the impact
o f the currency devaluation, have helped to reactivate Argentina’s nascent mining industry,
including a three-fold increase in mining investments between 2003 and 2004 and a doubling o f
i t s contribution to GDP since the crisis, from 2.5 percent in 2001 to 5.2 percent in 2004.
Moving towards sustainable agriculture and rural development. A stronger, more
39.
competitive agriculture sector hinges on strengthening national and regional institutions,
particularly those responsible for agricultural technology, innovation, and finance. Stronger
collective action i s also required to strengthen shared public and private interests, such as
irrigation management, productive chains, and regional plant and animal health. Agriculture i s
critical to Argentina both as a dynamic source o f export revenue but also as an entry point to
address rural poverty and natural resource degradation. In 2004, the agriculture sector
represented 9 percent o f GDP, and contributed 58 percent o f total goods exports (40 percent o f
which was primary and 60 percent processed goods). When backward and forward linkages are
included, the sector assumes even greater importance and employs about 36 percent o f the total
labor force. Favorable market conditions in recent years have boosted production-grain
production has almost doubled since the mid-1990s and reached 84 million tons in the 2004/05
season-but not without costs. In this context, resource degradation is a growing challenge for

19

Argentina, ranging from deforestation linked to the current soy bean boom, land degradation
associated with poor water resources management, and environmental health issues related to
pesticide management. Soy plantations have displaced native forests and traditional crops, with
major environmental impacts and related effects on poverty. The Government has set out plans
for land use management, forest conservation, and broader environmental protection. The Doha
Round o f trade negotiations remains a critical pending issue, as i t s successful conclusion,
including liberalization o f trade in agricultural products, would significantly expand Argentina's
trading opportunities. Given the l o w labor absorption o f much agricultural production,
mitigating high rural poverty levels will depend on continued growth in the non-traditional
regional economies, both on-and-off-farm, and improved access to and quality o f rural education
and other services.

Social Inclusion

Reducing structural poverty. The economic recovery and political stability that have
prevailed since the crisis place Argentina in a favorable position to begin to reverse the
deepening trend o f structural poverty and inequality that has taken root in recent decades as the

percent in 2003, before falling back to
33.8 percent at end 2005. During each
period o f recovery, poverty remained significantly above i t s previous levels. Inequality has
followed a similar pattern with the Gini coefficient increasing from 0.42 in 1986 to nearly 0.53
by 2003 before easing to about 0.50 in 2005.

41.
The effects o f crises have been particularly hard on the poor given the weaknesses in the
social protection system in Argentina. This was especially evident in the 2001-02 crisis, and
underscored the importance o f addressing long-standing problems in social protection. First, the
system, as in other countries in the region, i s fragmented, with programs aimed at different
groups o f the population. These programs are inadequately integrated and coordinated with the
20

key institutions, resulting in overlap, but much more important, gaps in coverage. Given the rise
of informal employment over the past two decades (and again during the recent economic crisis),
the proportion o f the labor force without access to social insurance has grown by nearly 30
percent since the early 1990s, representing nearly two-thirds o f workers by 2004. Expanding the
reach o f social insurance coverage will be crucial for improving the effectiveness o f the entire
social protection system.
42.
Second, as a result o f the failure o f the formal social protection system, Argentina
established other programs to provide protection to informal workers when unemployment
started to grow in the1990s, and later in response to the 2001 crisis. Traditionally, such social
assistance programs were relatively small in scope, and meagerly financed. The emergency
Heads o f Household workfare program, established in response to the crisis, marked a larger
scale and critical response, increasing coverage substantially (to 2 million beneficiaries in M a y
2003 and about 1.4 million today). The Government has defined a transition strategy based on
the re-integration o f i t s beneficiaries into the labor market (through education, training and active
employment policies) or to a conditional cash transfer linked to families’ investment in education
and health services. A similar transitioning out o f the emergency mode i s s t i l l pending for the
large food programs, which acted more as an additional income support mechanism than to attain
nutritional objectives (Annex F).
43.
Improving health outcomes. The Government has introduced important policy changes
geared to improve Argentina’s health indicators, which remain below comparable middleincome countries in the region. L i f e expectancy trails regional neighbors and inequalities in
maternal and infant mortality between regions o f the country are pronounced. This performance
has been due to a combination o f structural problems in the health sector (i.e., fragmentation and
lack o f coordination o f health policy among provinces in a highly federal country, delays at the
provincial level to introduce incentives for providers to improve efficiency) as well as the impact
o f the recent crisis on the availability o f key inputs for the delivery o f essential health services
(i.e,, vaccines and medications). The Government has implemented a wide range o f policy
actions to overcome the challenges on both the structural and inputs related issues (Box 3).
Box 3: Health Policy Innovations in Argentina
Since 2002, the Argentine Government has implemented a wide range o f policy actions t o overcome both the
structural and the input challenges in recent years. Such actions have included a substantial revision o f drugs policy
t o increase the availability o f generic drugs as w e l l as an emergency provision o f essential drugs t o the poor
(Remediar program), Also, the Government achieved a significant break-through with the passing o f the Sexual and
Reproductive Rights Law-the l a w provided the basis for a long awaited and m u c h needed policy and regulatory
framework. This i s crucial as Argentina has one o f the lowest levels o f family planning among middle-income
countries in the region, particularly among the poor. Third, a revival o f the Federal Health Council (COFESA) took
place and the council is n o w an effective coordinating mechanism between the federal and provincial levels. Lastly,
and most prominently, the Government launched, with B a n k support, the maternal-child insurance program (Plan
Nacer). This program has been designed t o respond simultaneously t o the immediate health care needs o f the poor
and introduce incentives for structural reform in the provider-consumer relationship at the provincial level through
the use o f results-based fbding provided by the national Government.

44.
Ensuring quality education for all. Argentina faces a complex policy agenda to ensure
that all children complete quality basic education, while at the same time addressing the

21

challenge o f adult education. The system has done well in terms o f ensuring access to early
childhood and primary education, especially in comparison to the region and other developing
countries. However, repetition and drop-out rates remain high at the secondary level. On
average, fifty percent o f students entering secondary school do not graduate; for families in the
poorest population quintile, only one in four students graduates. Quality o f learning is a concern
as manifested l o w scores on standardized assessments. Management and administration reforms,
including policies for the development o f human resources at the provincial level, can help
improve the effectiveness o f the education system. Financing and accountability reforms would
address overlapping expenditure responsibilities between different government levels and link
federal education funding (outside o f revenue sharing arrangements) to counterpart financing and
specific results to be achieved by provincial administrations.
Towards greater social inclusion. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing Argentina, as
45.
the country attempts to move fkom crisis recovery to growth with equity, is to generate
sustainable sources o f opportunity for the most marginalized groups in society. Social exclusion
and marginalization have become increasingly acute. By end 2004, the national headcount
poverty rate among children was 56 percent, reaching more than 70 percent in certain regions o f
the country. Working women were less likely to have permanent jobs, and substantially less
likely to be eligible for social security and employment offered health plans. As for indigenous
people, the long history o f marginalization has contributed to poverty rates in excess o f two
times the rate o f non-indigenous Argentines. There is no simplistic answer to the challenge o f
creating a new generation o f economic and social policies and programs which, while responding
to immediate needs, also move towards greater equality o f opportunity in Argentina (For
additional information on Poverty and Social Development see Annex F, and for Millennium
Development Goals, see Annex G).

Governance has long been a major issue in Argentina with serious implications for both
sustainable growth and social equity. W h i l e citizen support for the Administration remains high,
building trust in public institutions will take time and persistent political will; perceptions based
on years, if not decades, o f experience will be hard to alter. According to WBI indicators,
Argentina’s governance and regulatory quality indicators lag behind the average for upper
middle income countries (Figure 10); in particular, government effectiveness stands at 42.2 out
o f 100, behind Russia, Turkey and China, and well behind i t s neighbors Chile (87), and Brazil
(58.2), and Uruguay (68.8).

authorities have stated their
commitment toward more
transparent and accountable public institutions, and indeed, some important steps have been
taken, The creation o f a national anti-corruption office and o f similar bodies in some provinces,
changes in control procedures and agencies, increasing use o f asset declarations by public
employees, and growing use of the procurement register and the internet to publish procurement
information all represent advances. The creation o f a Financial Intelligence Unit, a public
agency responsible for collecting, analyzing and disseminating information o n suspicious
transactions which may indicate money laundering activities, i s also an important step.

49.
Nevertheless, more needs to be done. Cross-cutting areas where the greatest transparency
gains are to be made-such as competitive procurement, civil service, and public expenditure
management-can produce results, provided there i s firm political leadership. Strengthening
supreme audit institutions, the anti-corruption office, and social accountability mechanisms can
complement these efforts. Normative changes, such as the ratification and implementation o f the
UN Convention against Corruption, progress in the implementation o f the OECD convention,
and a framework for access to information and whistleblower protection, would help strengthen
the legal framework for effective action and broaden alliances. Above all, as in all countries,
concrete gains in transparency and the fight against corruption and money laundering depend
fundamentally on sustained political will to translate technical changes into real improvements in
administrative practice, together with outreach efforts to build public trust.
50.
Strengthening the justice system. Improving judicial performance, as in many countries
in the region, continues to be a long-term challenge for Argentina. The return to democracy
inspired significant efforts to improve qualitative and quantitative aspects o f the justice system's

performance. The federal and provincial authorities have increased judicial budgets, introduced
new forms o f judicial governance, revised basic codes (most notably those governing criminal
justice), and expanded the use of alternative dispute resolution. Argentine courts generally
handle large caseloads, publish their decisions, and make available statistics on progress in
keeping up with demand. Nevertheless, complaints about judicial performance-inefficiency,
24

delays, corruption, limited access, and politicization-continue.
There is also a perception,
based o n disputes arising from the asymmetric peszjkation (Le,, conversion o f foreign exchange
bank loans and deposits at different exchange rates) and other policies adopted during the
economic crisis, that the system provides insufficient protection for property rights and contract
enforcement. The legal community and other stakeholders have renewed demands for reform,
focusing on fuller enactment o f the earlier legal changes and additional measures to increase
efficiency and broaden access. Progress at the federal level has been uneven. Progress at the
subnational level has also varied; several provincial judiciaries have reduced delays, expanded
services, and adopted alternative dispute resolution programs.

5 1,
Making the federal system work: decentralization and regional development.
Unlocking the development potential o f Argentina’s highly federalized system has challenged
administration after administration. Important progress has been made in specific areas o f state
modernization at the provincial level, such as tax administration and financial management. The
authorities are continuing to pursue this incremental approach where entry points exist, such as
in sub-national public expenditure management, institution-building, and promotion o f public
private partnerships. In addition, limited initiatives have been taken in certain central
government transfers, e.g., under the Plan Nacer for maternal and child health. However, the
limitations with respect to the current Government’s attempt to reform the revenue-sharing
system (coparticipacidn) illustrates the difficulty o f introducing the more fundamental changes,
particularly with regard to intergovernmental transfers, necessary to establish broad-based
incentives for improved fiscal sustainability, service-delivery and competitiveness at the subnational level.
52.
The Kirchner Administration did achieve a potentially important step forward with the
approval o f the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2004, which establishes general rules for fiscal
performance and for ensuring greater transparency in fiscal accounts. So far, 19 provinces out o f
24 have voted to adopt the Law, representing over 75 percent o f total provincial spending. W h i l e
the FRL could prove to be an important milestone, additional steps would be needed to address
(i)
the lack o f hard constraints on sub-national spending and borrowing, (ii)
the exclusion o f
important parts o f the budget (such as capital expenditures and IFI-financed expenditures), (iii)
the establishment o f mechanisms to ensure sub-national budgets are consistent with aggregate
fiscal objectives, and (iv) the continued ability o f provinces to pledge their co-participation
receipts against future debt service.

25

V. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK
53.
The strong track record o f three straight years o f high growth has instilled new
confidence in the economy and reduced substantially the exceptional uncertainty o f the crisis
period. The short-term economic outlook remains broadly favorable, with the main concern
being inflation. The degree o f uncertainty increases markedly when considering the mediumterm-outlook. On the one hand, increases in capacity utilization and other considerations point to
the need for structural reforms to underpin sustained growth, in particular to consolidate the
fiscal adjustment and promote investment in infrastructure and public services. On the other
hand, the Government has not committed to these reforms and has become much more directly
involved in decisions regarding the level o f investment and its allocation. A wide range o f
macroeconomic outcomes i s therefore possible, depending in large part on what policies the
Government actually implements in practice.

The projections prepared by the Government in the context o f the 2006 budget,
summarized in Table 2, serve as a useful point o f reference for characterizing the range of
macroeconomic scenarios consistent with the base case program o f the new CAS. The 2006
Budget projections are consistent with the medium-term projections in the “Economic Policy
Guidelines” prepared by the Government for the CAS (Annex A).The overriding macroeconomic
objective is to move forward with the transition from recovery to sustained growth. The
Government i s projecting 4 percent growth in 2006, decelerating slightly to 3.5 percent in 200708, This medium-term growth i s supported by a projected increase in the investment to GDP
ratio to the 21-22 percent range and steady expansion o f external trade. The Government’s
growth forecast appears conservative, particularly given the strong performance in 2005, and
actual medium-term growth could well be higher, notably i f the Government were to strengthen
i t s reform commitment. Private sector GDP growth forecasts for 2006 are considerably higher,
on the order o f 6.5-7 percent’.
55.
The Government i s projecting a gradual decline in inflation following the re-emergence
of price pressures in 2005. The authorities have been negotiating administrative price agreements
BCRA Survey, January 2006.

with specific groups of producers and retailers. The authorities’ view i s that, within a broader
anti-inflation strategy that includes efforts to stimulate investment and slow down the expansion
o f private demand, these price agreements serve as a temporary anchor for expectations in the
context o f inflation which they see essentially as a transitory process o f adjustment o f relative
prices. The authorities also view the agreements as a substantial element o f the Government’s
income policy that contributes to limit increases in domestic prices for products which have
benefited from temporary increases in international prices. For i t s part, the Bank is concerned
that higher inflation reflects primarily excess demand, h e l e d inter alia by the increase in
primary government spending and the large increases in the money supply that have resulted
from the partial sterilization o f foreign exchange purchases by the Central Bank. The money
supply increased rapidly in nominal terms over the course o f 2005-28 percent for currency in
circulation and 26 percent for broad money (M2). Inflation expectations for 2006 are well above
10 percent. In the Bank’s view, curtailing inflation will hinge on a tightening o f macroeconomic
policies - specifically monetary policy - in order to ensure that aggregate demand i s aligned with
supply, A key policy variable for maintaining macroeconomic stability over the medium term i s
the primary surplus which the Government projects to remain in the 3-3.5 percent o f GDP range.

56.
Based o n the macroeconomic framework envisaged in the 2006 government budget
(Table 3), financing needs o f the Federal Government are projected by the Bank to be on the
order o f US$12-13 billion in 2006 and in the range o f US$13-14 billion p.a. in 2007-08. The
financing o f these obligations under this baseline scenario would entail bond issues on the order
of US$2 billion in 2006, rising to US$4 billion in 2007-08. The financing plan for 2006
incorporates a cash build up (pre-financing) o f some US$1 billion in 2005 as bond issuance last
year exceeded financing requirements. As a result, the bond rollover rate i s projected to be about
50 percent in 2006. ,Bond rollover rates would increase to some 100 percent in 2007-08,
signaling tighter financing conditions over the medium term in the absence o f renewed policy
lending from the IFIs. These projections reflect the early repayment in January 2006 o f
Argentina’s full US$9.7 billion outstanding debt to the IMF which effectively lowered the
Federal Government’s medium-term financing needs by over US$10 billion.”

l o As part o f this operation, the Government issued t o the Central B a n k a note with a ten year bullet maturity,
denominated in US dollars and paying an interest rate equivalent to the average yield o n international reserves.

Under the baseline projection, gross public debt would remain broadly stable through the
CAS period in U S dollar terms, and decline to the range o f 65 percent o f GDP by 2008.
However, as with the macroeconomic framework itself, the degree o f uncertainty regarding the
public debt path and financing plan remains significant. Under a high case scenario where
growth rates and the primary surplus were one percentage point higher than in the baseline and
the real exchange rate were to appreciate 10 percent relative to the baseline, the projected debt
would decline to the 55 percent o f GDP range by 2008 (Figure 13.a), and bond rollover rates in
2007-08 would be significantly lower (Figure 13.b). On the other hand, in a l o w scenario
incorporating lower GDP growth and primary surpluses (1 percentage point below the baseline
scenario) and 10 percent real exchange rate depreciation relative to the baseline, the debt to GDP
ratio would remain above 75 percent by 2008 and rollover rates would increase sharply.

Argentina’s recovery has been faster and stronger than expected, and substantial progress
has been made in a number o f areas since the crisis, particularly with respect to the pro-poor
effects o f the growth on lower poverty and unemployment levels. While the near-term outlook
for continued growth remains favorable, given the continued uncertainty in the direction in
which the authorities may steer policy, the medium-term outlook for sustaining growth cannot be
assured, and the basis for policy based lending cannot be considered to be adequate at this time.

VI. THE BANK GROUP’S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Rationale for Bank Support to Argentina

A.

59.
The rationale for continued World Bank support to Argentina remains compelling, and i s
consistent with the Bank’s strategy for assistance to middle income countries described in the
Board Report, Enhancing World Bank Support to Middle Income Countries (SecM2004-0071).
First, the Bank has a key role to play in helping Argentina-to the extent i t s policy framework
can be supported-tackle a massive development agenda for sustaining growth, reducing poverty
and promoting improved governance. At nearly 34 percent o f the population, poverty in
Argentina i s high, and, after successive periods o f fast growth and deep recession, i s becoming
increasingly structural. Moreover, this national average masks severe geographical and
demographic inequalities. A visitor to Buenos Aires’ broad avenues would hardly know that
social conditions in some parts o f the country-including just miles from the capital city-are
virtually indistinguishable from the poorest parts o f any area in the developing world. Tackling
these problems will require substantial and sustained investments in many areas, and the longt e r m resources available from the Bank Group-including IFC-can be particularly relevant in a
country that has suffered from a high degree o f volatility in i t s external financing. Second, the
Bank remains an important global interlocutor with the Argentine authorities, and maintains
extensive outreach to the private sector and civil society. The dialogue that has been carried out
in relation to the 2005 study on sustained,growth and social equity suggests the value o f the
Bank’s global perspective to Argentina. As client research conducted for the CAS indicates, the
private sector and civil society believe that the Bank can play a role as a neutral voice in the
national debate on economic and social issues. Finally, with some US$7 billion in exposure to
Argentina, the Bank has a large financial stake in helping the country secure i t s future.
Strategic Objectives of the CAS

B.

60.
The overall objective o f the new CAS is to seek opportunities to build a medium-term
investment partnership to support the transition from crisis recovery to sustained growth with
continued poverty reduction and improved equity. In this context, the interventions are designed
to advance the three pillars established under the 2004 CAS: (1) sustained growth with equity,
(2) social inclusion, and (3) improved governance. To provide the kind o f cross-cutting and
mutually reinforcing support necessary to achieve progress in these pillars, the Bank’s
interventions are designed around three core principles which help anchor each proposed activity
under the CAS to selected focus areas where it i s expected that the Bank can make significant
contributions. The principles are:
0

0

The Bank’s support i s performance based. The program has clear triggers, including
portfolio Performance and fiduciary management, which will determine the level o f Bank
lending. At the sector level, the quality o f the policy framework and implementation
performance will determine the pace and extent o f new lending. At the project level,
Bank interventions are designed around clear development outcomes and incorporate
incentives to progress toward those outcomes.
The Bank’s support i s selective. The Bank i s a relatively small player in Argentina. It
i s therefore crucial to seek partners, and not claim results beyond the Bank’s capacity to
support change and deliver results.
Where productive dialogue does provide

30

0

opportunities to affect sector policy more broadly, such as the health sector, the Bank will
seek to leverage its impact, recognizing the inherent risks.
The Bank’s support focuses on poverty alleviation. The interventions outlined in the
CAS are oriented to reach the poorest and most vulnerable populations; promote equality
of opportunity; stimulate growth that i s sustainable, pro-poor and equitably shared; and
strengthen governance and public service administration to improve access to public
services by all Argentines in every part o f the country.

61.
As was the case in the 2004 CAS, the Bank will continue to seek engagement with the
authorities across the full range o f development challenges, while providing lending and other
support where there i s an adequate degree o f consensus on policies and objectives. To date, four
specific areas, distributed across the pillars, stand out where the Bank has reached consensus
with the Government on key policies and where the bulk o f new investment lending has
materialized. These areas are:
0

0

0

0

Infrastructure, including (i)transportation, including road network management,
rehabilitation and maintenance through performance-based contracts, (ii)
water supply
and sanitation targeting priority municipal level investments and maintenance with
poverty criteria, and (iii)
urban flood and drainage.
Health, notably maternal and child health but also including support for broader sector
reforms.
Income Transfer Programs, through support to the emergency Heads o f Household
program and i t s transition towards a more streamlined and sustainable social safety net.
Public Sector Strengthening, particularly with respect to institutional strengthening at
both the federal and provincial levels.

62.
The new CAS features significant new lending that aims to build on progress achieved in
these four specific areas with a view to consolidating the investment partnership. This
encompasses second phase APLs and other follow-up projects; it also includes new lending
designed to expand the scope o f the existing consensus, for example, going beyond road
rehabilitation and maintenance to broader sector issues in transportation. The CAS also
incorporates investments in areas where new lending has started, or where active dialogue i s
underway and consensus i s within reach. K e y areas in this context include education,
innovation, water resource management, rural development and the environment. Another
strategic area the Bank i s trying to expand i s its direct lending to the provinces, as i s the case
with an urban flood and drainage project and in other infrastructure projects (for example, the
closure of three provincial reform loans approved prior to the 2004 CAS and the preparation o f
new investment operations in these same provinces under the new CAS-see Section VII).
63.
O n important issues where consensus i s not yet in sight, the Bank will continue to
monitor and seek to develop, or expand, active dialogue-with the aid o f analytical work as
appropriate. The objective i s to establish the foundation for consensus and, where appropriate,
possible new lending in the future. The Bank plans to maintain close monitoring o f
macroeconomic developments; to open a dialogue on selected financial sector issues, e.g.,
cooperative and SME credit; and to expand engagement o n poverty to address important issues
o f informality and labor market dynamics, rural poverty issues and urban challenges, including
water.
31

64.

The CAS continues the strong emphasis on portfolio management and fiduciary control,
with the level and pace o f lending depending on government performance. The CAS includes
targeted AAA to support the fiduciary action plan (Box 8), with CFAAs and CPARs (at both
federal and provincial levels) as well as a ROSC envisaged during the CAS period. The program
also features technical assistance to help build institutional capacity at the local, provincial and
national levels.
65.
Within the three pillars, Bank support under the new CAS i s concentrated on a limited set
o f core objectives which have emerged from the analysis of Argentina’s development challenges,
the progress achieved under the 2004 CAS-notably in the four areas mentioned above-and the
CAS consultation process. The core objectives and the highlights o f Bank support are
summarized below under each o f the CAS pillars. A more extensive presentation on the
proposed operational program i s provided in Annex H. Indicative outcome indicators are
presented in the CAS Results Matrix (Annex K).
66.
A CAS Progress Report will be prepared mid-way through the CAS period (end-FY
2007), evaluating progress toward the CAS objectives with respect to the overall program and
results indicators. Based on this evaluation, the Progress Report would propose adjustments to
the program as appropriate. Management also proposes to provide periodic briefings to the
Board on ongoing economic developments and the medium term outlook.
Sustained Growth with Equity

67.
The CAS recognizes that the recovery achieved since the crisis has been not just rapid but
also pro-poor. The Bank seeks to help to build on this progress and support Argentina’s efforts
to sustain equitable growth over the medium term. In addition, IFC and MIGA will complement
the Bank’s support for this pillar in their areas o f respective comparative advantage, as described
in Section VI. The core objectives under the sustained growth pillar encompass: (a)
infrastructure development with a focus on expanding access o f the poor to basic services,
(water supply and sanitation, urban transport, regional transport), reducing vulnerability to urban
flooding and drainage problems, and removing logistics and transportation bottlenecks including
an improvement o f the country’s road system through performance-based management contracts
to facilitate the expansion o f trade and growth; and (b) rural development and the
environment with a focus on promoting agricultural growth, reducing rural poverty, and
improving environmental management-all
o f which stand out as critical and relatively
unaddressed concerns. The growth pillar o f the CAS also features important initiatives to
at the macroeconomic level, efforts to build on the
maintain and broaden dialogue including: (i)
positive results achieved through the growth and social equity analysis, and maintain close
macro-monitoring; and (ii)
re-establish a dialogue on the financial sector and the investment
climate centered on selected issues related to restoring i t s financial intermediation role, as well
as continue the on-going monitoring o f financial sector developments.
68.
Constructive dialogue and a broad degree o f consensus set the basis for moving forward
on infrastructure development. The CAS program will seek to: (i)leverage the progress
achieved in infrastructure, by scaling up support for transport asset development and
management, expanding the road rehabilitation and maintenance program (at the federal and
provincial levels) and broadening the scope o f Bank support to encompass regional transport
32

corridors, logistics improvements and urban transport; (ii)
improve access to basic water supply
and sanitation, and (iii)
implement proposed interventions in urban flood protection and drainage
at the municipal level, and develop an integrated water resources management strategy. In the
context o f Bank support for infrastructure and public services, the Bank will ensure that
appropriate steps have been taken to secure the economic and financial sustainability o f the
operators, including resolution o f investor conflicts and establishment o f appropriate regulatory
frameworks.

69.
The Buenos Aires (BA) Province Sustainable Infrastructure Development Project (SIDP)
APL provides a good model for future infrastructure support at the provincial level, including a
framework for ensuring sustainability. * The project i s improving the provision o f infrastructure
services, including road rehabilitation and maintenance, water supply and sanitation, and flood
prevention as a means o f supporting sustainable growth, alleviating poverty, and increasing
social equity. Jointly with the provincial authorities, the project has supported the development
and monitoring o f a fiscal framework to help ensure the sustainability o f the proposed
investments, Other models, coordinated at the federal level (including national projects or
provincial level projects with subsidiary agreements), will be implemented to improve
infrastructure and reduce logistic costs (e.g., provincial roads and national highway assets
through performance-based contracts executed by the private sector). The CAS includes
possible lending for regional infrastructure including inter alia freight corridor upgrades and
logistic node improvements which would tap into regional opportunities, expand productivity
and lower logistic costs. Urban transport interventions would aim to increase the mobility o f the
urban poor and vulnerable groups. Additional lending will seek to build on these investments by
focusing on support for municipalities in basic services and transport.

70.
In the area o f water, the Bank will continue to support strategic investments geared to
improve access o f the poor to basic water supply and sanitation services as in the province o f
Buenos Aires under the BA SIDP APL and in other municipalities across Argentina under the
Basic Municipal Services 1 and 2 projects. The BA SIDP APL seeks to help expand water and
especially sewage coverage by subsidizing access to approximately one-half million l o w income
people living in areas o f high sanitary or environmental vulnerability. As has been the case with
the BA SIDP APL, Bank support for water supply investments will continue to be based in a
sound policy framework which provides for the economic and financial sustainability o f the
operations. Flooding i s a major natural hazard for Argentina. The Bank has provided important
support to the City o f Buenos Aires with the Urban Flood Prevention APL, and will continue
under the second phase to expand the assistance to other eligible provinces at risk. The project
seeks to increase the country's resilience to floods through protection o f critical urban
infrastructure, and to introduce a risk management approach to investments o f provincial and
municipal governments. K e y goals are to increase population awareness and preparedness to the
threat o f floods as evidenced by improvements in flood protection levels, a reduction in the
population living in areas at risk o f flooding, and a reduction in damage to properties by storms.
Discussions have been held with the Government with respect to expanding the construction o f
low-cost, self-help housing in flood prone areas generally inhabited by the poor. Broader river-

basin wide planning and investments will be provided under the Integrated Water Resources
Management project.
The C A S seeks to build on existing operations and promising dialogue on rural
71.
development and initial new lending on the environment into new areas o f investment
partnership. The rural growth agenda encompasses supplemental financing under the existing
PROSAP operation as part o f a regional program to combat foot and mouth disease. The longerterm strategy includes support under a follow-up operation (PROSAP 2) for expanded rural
infrastructure, improved technical services to producers, and increased access to export markets
through improved product innovation, quality and marketing. The rural poverty agenda includes
targeted support to small farmers, community driven development (CDD) type financing to rural
communities (including in indigenous areas), and the strengthening o f service delivery across the
many agencies active in rural areas. The CAS also aims to support the Government’s effort to
strengthen the environmental agenda in Argentina. In this context, an Environmental
Management APL i s planned that will provide strategic support to Argentina’s brown (pollution),
green (natural resources), and land use agendas. The APL will build on a Country
Environmental Assessment, and will incorporate the use o f GEF and carbon finance resources to
the full extent possible. I t will also build on two targeted environmental projects: the Solid
Waste Management Project approved by the Board in February 2006 and the Mining
Decontamination Project for which preparation has been extended to allow for expanded
consultations.
Box 4: MainstreamingGlobal Environmental Facility (GEF) and Carbon Finance in Argentina
The current W o r l d B a n k GEFMontreal ProtocoVCarbon Finance program in Argentina amounts t o six operations
with a total funding level o f US$40.2 million. Operations take place in biodiversity, climate change, international
waters, ozone depletion, and carbon financing o f municipal waste.
Given Argentina’s size and Government priorities, there i s potential for deepening the program. The Bank’s GEF
strategy in Argentina is t o blend GEF-financed activities with Bank loans, n o t only t o better leverage GEF resources
but to better mainstream global environmental concerns in country programs. The proposed Bank program includes
GEF co-financing in a l l rural and environment projects, including in the Environmental Management A P L (in
biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, marine resources, persistent organic pollutants, transport);
Rural Growth and Poverty (sustainable land management), and Integrated Water Resources Managemenl
(international waters, integrated ecosystems). There is one free-standing GEF project o n Energy Efficiency in the
pipeline. Regional GEF activities are focusing o n both shared water (both surface and the Guarani aquifer) and
terrestrial resources (grasslands) shared by the Mercosur countries. Finally, the Argentina decentralized mediumsized grants program (FY 2006-08), a world-wide GEF pilot, will finance the most innovative responses t o national
environmental priorities f r o m c i v i l society.
The Argentine Carbon Fund was launched by President Kirchner in September 2005 in order to maximize the
incorporation o f carbon finance in both public and private sector investments. However, constraints remain before
carbon finance can be substantially scaled-up in Argentina, such as the country’s investment risk, l i m i t s o n the
availability o f credit and institutional support f r o m the financial sector, and the need t o define a medium-term path
for electricity tariffs. The W o r l d Bank i s supporting this activity in two important ways: (a) technical assistance in
the design o f the Fund and in the development o f carbon finance eligible projects (specifically, under the Clean
Development Mechanism o f the K y o t o Protocol), and (b) offering t o be the lead buyer for up to one-third o f the
viable assets put o n the market, especially in waste management, agro-forestry, industrial and energy sectors.

Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion

72.
The reductions in poverty and inequality that have taken place since the depth o f the
crisis are welcome, but in both cases current levels remain higher than before the recession, and
higher than a decade ago. M u c h work remains to address the longer t e r m trend o f increased
poverty and inequality that has taken root in Argentina, and particularly with respect to the
unique challenges facing rural areas, and o f marginalized groups such as indigenous, the elderly,
and youth. The C A S emphasizes the following objectives: (i)
supporting the creation o f more
permanent safety nets and fostering employment, notably making the transition from
emergency income programs to initiatives that foster employment and establishing more
permanent safety nets geared to provide direct support to vulnerable groups; and (ii)
better
health and education outcomes by supporting efforts to improve health service delivery at the
provincial level; and raise school completion rates and improve learning outcomes, especially for
children from disadvantaged families. The social inclusion pillar also aims to deepen the
dialogue on poverty through programmatic analytical work initially focused on informality, as
well as continued work on the specific challenges inherent in addressing rural and urban poverty.
73.
The coming years will likely see a major shift to emphasize employment promotion
policies while winding down emergency assistance programs. In the new CAS period, the Bank
would support this emphasis through activities including implementation o f the Heads o f
Household Transition project, which l i n k s income-support to beneficiaries participating in
training and education courses as well as job interviews and active employment search supported
by municipal employment officers. To complement this, the CAS includes support for a national
Lifelong Learning and Skill Improvement project which would aim to develop flexible learning
opportunities for the unemployed and poor workers to acquire labor-market relevant skills.
While many o f the current beneficiaries o f income support programs will be able to reintegrate
themselves in wage-or self-employment, a more permanent safety net will be needed for the
structurally poor in Argentina. Such a safety net would not only cover today’s beneficiaries o f
social assistance programs, but ideally would also reach out to the extreme poor that do not have
access to such support (60 percent o f the extreme poor i s not covered). The CAS envisages Bank
support for this restructuring o f the social safety net, as well as helping to address the particular
challenges confronting the rural poor. I F C plans to back this pillar through “linkages” technical
assistance that would enhance private sector development and j o b creation in areas linked to I F C
investments.

74.
WBI plans to support this restructuring effort through a program o f training and “just-intime” policy advice, aimed at drawing on best practice from around the world, including from
the OECD countries. This will consist o f a combination o f awareness raising, consensus
building, knowledge sharing and capacity development interventions. As a first stage WBI
envisages sharing experiences and lessons learned from OECD and relevant middle income
countries on safety net programs and supporting services designed to help household graduate
out of poverty. The first stage would culminate in a high visibility policy conference designed to
initiate the reform process by raising awareness and gathering consensus around future
orientations, In a second stage, WBI intends to design and deliver customized training courses
and workshops targeted to key counterparts in the design, implementation and evaluation o f
safety net interventions. WBI will also aim to facilitate access to experts and practitioners from

35

other countries for just-in-time “how-to” advice on design and implementation o f safety net
programs.
75.
The CAS seeks to build on the success that has been achieved in improving health service
delivery under the Provincial Maternal-Child Health SECAL and APL, with the second and third
phases o f the APL to be combined into a single operation. The authorities have been successful
in reversing the increases in the national rate o f infant mortality seen after the crisis and the
Bank’s strategy aims to build on this outcome. Closely complementary, new lending for an
Essential Health Functions project i s proposed that would replicate the incentive and governance
structures introduced under the Plan Nacer to public health functions at the provincial level. To
help Argentina improve access and raise the quality o f rural education, the Bank recently
approved a Rural Education Project. This project supports the strategic orientation o f the
Government in (i)
establishing results-based contracts between the national and provincial levels;
and (ii)linking funding at least partially to results. Looking forward, the CAS envisages a
Provincial Preschool and Basic Education project which would finance results-oriented
preschool and basic education investments in poor areas o f one (or potentially two) o f those
provinces with the largest education needs.
Improved Governance

76.
The Government has committed to strengthening public sector performance within
Argentina’s strongly federal system, with a view towards improving the effectiveness o f basic
service delivery, and building transparency and trust. The CAS seeks to support these twin
objectives primarily through building on the notable progress achieved in Bank support for
institutional strengthening at both the national and sub-national levels. N e w investments would
be complemented by analytical work on intergovernmental fiscal relations, fiduciary
management (CFAA) and possibly economic work at the sub-national level. Initial steps to
establish a dialogue through ongoing AAA could also lead to support for strengthening the
judiciary to help improve the accessibility, impartiality and effectiveness o f the justice system.
Should the dialogue result in consensus on needed reforms, WBI would support the reform effort
through an action-learning program to address topics such as: the role o f the judiciary in
improving government performance; the role o f the judiciary in fighting corruption; mechanisms
for promoting judicial independence; and mechanisms for promoting effective and equitable
access to justice for all.
77.
The CAS will seek to both broaden and deepen the emerging investment partnership in
favor of institution strengthening in selected areas o f public sector management including
expenditure management, transparency, and service delivery. The Bank will continue i t s support
of projects that have delivered concrete results in specific institutions at the national level, such
as the work on the National Social Security Administration (ANSES2), and the National Social
and Fiscal Identification System project (SINTyS, APL2). Support at the sub-national level
would continue to operate through two channels: (a) institutional support for public expenditure
management in the context o f direct provincial investment loans building o n the model o f the
Buenos Aires Province APL, and (b) support for broader public sector management initiatives in
selected provinces under stand-alone operations following up o n the Sub-national Governments
Public Sector Modernization project. The latter, approved in December 2005, aims to improve
the institutional capabilities o f provincial governments to effectively manage their resources and
36

implement sound fiscal policies, while also improving the quality o f service delivery to citizens
and creating better conditions for accountability and transparency. Public sector strengthening
will be further supported by the Governance 21 and Basic Municipal Services (1 and 2) projects;
the former includes investments to expand the integrated financial management information
system (SIDIP) at the national level and the public investment management system (BAPIN) at
the sub-national level, while the latter includes institutional support to improve service delivery
at the local level.

78.
Support for these projects will be complemented by WBI learning programs focused on
building capacity of municipal governments. Programs will include the “municipal headstart”
program, which i s targeted to newly elected mayors and their teams, and has been used
successfully in other countries to improve quality o f public sector management at local level.
WBI will also facilitate sharing o f relevant experience from other countries in the Region,
looking, inter alia, at initiatives such as Brazil’s fiscal responsibility law, and Mexico’s system
of municipal planning councils which have been successful in professionalizing public
administration at sub-national level. The CAS will also seek to help the Government improve
and harmonize social sector statistics as they relate to monitoring Argentina’s progress in
achieving the MDGs and other social objectives. The national statistical agency has expressed
interest in Bank support, possibly through a statistical capacity building program (STATCAP),
and this request i s under discussion with the Government. WBI will work with the Government
to establish a baseline for benchmarking and monitoring progress on improving governance at
both national and sub-national level. Depending on results o f a review o f available data (from
Government and from civil society groups such as Transparency International), WBI may
recommend a country governance diagnostic survey effort, which can form the basis for an
action plan.
C.

The Bank’s Analytic Agenda

79.
As indicated above, the Bank will seek to support Argentina with investment operations
where engagement with the authorities has been strong, such as in the health sector, and where
there i s substantial agreement o n approach. In those key areas where engagement remains
undeveloped, such as macroeconomic policy and the financial sector, or where there are
opportunities to deepen the engagement, such as poverty, the Bank will seek to develop
analytical products that could open the way for new or broader dialogue, while continuing to
monitor progress. The report “Seeking Sustained Growth and Social Equity”, which was
prepared in coordination with government authorities and others, i s an example. K e y areas o f
analytical work planned for the CAS include the following areas, which underpin the CAS pillars
and advance the Bank’s understanding o f the country in crucial areas:
0

A programmatic poverty assessment will build o n the success o f the growth with equity
study, The study will be a three-phase programmatic approach focused on the l i n k s
between informality, poverty, and inequality. The first phase involves an in-depth study
of trends o f informal employment, characteristics o f informal f i r m s and workers, i t s
determinants and welfare implications. The second phase i s expected to focus on issues
related to rural poverty and policy options which will require new household survey work
in rural areas. The third phase is envisaged to focus o n urban poverty issues including

access to basic services such as water supply. Additional outputs o f the programmatic
poverty assessment include regular poverty monitoring and dissemination events.
A programmatic social protection study will analyze policy options to support the
transition from the Heads o f Household program to a more permanent social safety net.
An Institutional and Governance Review (IGR), nearing completion, looks at the
experience o f public sector reform at both the national and provincial level to identify
where significant progress has been made and where impediments have proved to be an
obstacle to progress. WBI will support the IGR effort by drawing o n lessons from other
countries and assisting with dissemination.
A study on environmental management in Argentina using the Country Environmental
Analysis approach will aim to provide a better understanding o f the economic impacts o f
degradation. I t will seek to offer a systematic framework for assessing costs and benefits
and a strategic approach for establishing national policy and investment priorities. The
study can also serve as a useful instrument for dialogue with Government and civil
society on environmental management issues across sectors.
Economic and sector work at the provincial level will center around Provincial Economic
Memoranda combining public expenditure analysis with growth and poverty studies.
Analytical work and monitoring o f the fiscal space for public investment and social
programs will build on the progress achieved under the previous CAS with establishing
fiscal frameworks under Bank operations to support public investments ,at the provincial
level.
Other identified studies aim to meet Bank core fiduciary and corporate responsibilities,
i.e., the proposed CFAAs, CPARs, and ROSC.
Civil Society Strategy

80.
After close and ongoing dialogue with civil society throughout the country, the Bank i s
focusing its outreach efforts with civil society on the two themes o f Youth and Transparency.
These subjects have emerged as central to the Bank’s interlocutors over recent years, including
in the CAS consultations for the 2004 as well as the 2006 CAS. The Bank’s work o n youth
builds on extensive experience in supporting civil society organizations working with young
people in Argentina and throughout the other countries o f the Southern Cone (Chile, Paraguay
and Uruguay). The most important o f these past initiatives were the Development Marketplace
in 2005 and the Small Grants Program 2004. Currently an ESW on Youth in Argentina i s being
undertaken. The challenge going forward i s to find new ways to support and interact with young
Argentines to think together o n the key issues, especially employment-a major concern for
Argentina’s young people. Ongoing and proposed projects aim at a closer interaction with youth
and at providing venues where youth can express their views.
81.
The other key issue that emerged in the Bank’s outreach to civil society i s transparency
and governance. The Bank will seek to build on its partnership with civil society in this area
through varied approaches.
One i s through the Small Grants Program, “Promoting
Transparency”, which will support activities that empower citizens to take initiatives to enhance
and influence development outcomes. This year’s initiative seeks to identify innovative projects
of civil society organizations that promote transparency and social accountability. Another k e y
initiative will be to involve the participation o f civil society in the implementation o f the Bank’s

38

Fiduciary Action Plan (Box 8). H o w governments secure and spend Bank financing has been a
major interest o f civil society groups and a consistent theme o f past consultations. Bank staff
have initiated discussions with a key NGO, Poder Ciudaduno, to utilize the model pactos de
transpurencia in World Bank financed procurement. The Bank will continue to work with civil
society to increase the availability o f information and ensure that NGOs’ can effectively monitor
the transparency o f bidding under Bank financed projects. WBI will complement these efforts
through learning programs on social accountability and citizen oversight aimed ,at enhancing the
role o f civil society in promoting transparency at both federal and sub-national level. A key
emphasis will be on preventing “clientelism” in social programs and cash transfer schemes.

E.

CAS Preparation Process and Lessons Learned

CAS Completion Report. The CAS Completion Report (Annex L) notes that the
82.
significant shift from development policy lending to a predominantly investment-led strategy has
been successful, but has also posed challenges for the Bank and the Government. The 2004 CAS
explicitly acknowledged that this shift would test the Government’s limited project management
capacity. The Bank will continue to work with the authorities to identify possible areas where
staff can partner with the Government to improve i t s project implementation capacity. Efforts
are underway to integrate in a phased manner enclave project implementation units (PIUS) into
regular line units within the public administration.
83.
The CAS Completion Report also notes that the abbreviated 20 month period o f approved
lending under the 2004 CAS has proven to be sub-optimal with respect to the development o f the
investment project pipeline. In the period 2004-05, Bank staff were able to develop new projects
in sectors where there were ongoing operations. The operational strategy made use o f the APL
as an instrument that would enable the Bank to work within the limited resource envelope
corresponding to a short period o f lending authorization. A strong project pipeline requires the
adoption of a medium term perspective and to work on a broad front with multiple initiatives.
Implicit in this i s a CAS envelope o f sufficient size and forward vision that would allow for
longer-term planning on the part o f the Bank and the Government.
84.
The CAS Completion Report also notes that policy dialogue on overall economic
management between the Bank, the Ministry o f Economy and Production, and other core
ministries o f the Federal Government has been minimal except for useful meetings held with
senior level authorities in mid-2005 in connection with the findings o f a Bank study on growth
and equity. In addition the private sector has been receptive to a dialogue with the Bank. The
Bank will continue to seek opportunities for engagement at all levels o f government and with the
private sector. One entry point i s to identify analytical work that responds to the interests and
needs of government counterparts and o f the private sector.

Box 5: Findings of the Client Research
Client Research: Main Findings and Lessons

T o better understand the environment in Argentina and h o w the W o r l d Bank i s perceived by its main
interlocutors and other stakeholders, the Bank commissioned two research tools to be carried out prior to
preparation o f the CAS, a client survey o f Bank stakeholders and interviews with leading opinion makers
f r o m politics, business and the media. Below are some key findings (see Annex Ifor more detail). The
bulk o f the data below comes f r o m the wider client survey, but in most cases those findings were supported
by the qualitative interviews.

Familiarity: Respondents knew the Bank fairly well. Some 65 percent o f respondents had three or
more years experience working with the Bank, while an additional 20 percent had between one
and three years. I t should be noted, however, that the interviews that formed the basis o f the
qualitative survey reveal that for many respondents, particularly those with limited direct
experience working with the Bank, the extent and accuracy o f their knowledge o f the Bank varied.
Where i s Argentina? Some three quarters o f respondents said that Argentina i s “currently headed
in the right direction”. Those f r o m government were substantially more optimistic than those
from the private sector and c i v i l society.
Growth Priorities: Respondents to the survey identified education and infrastructure as the t w o
leading priorities for sustaining the rapid growth.
Development Priorities: Expanding the question to “development challenges” more broadly, 44
percent o f respondents chose j o b creation as the most important o r second most important priority.
Poverty reduction, education and governance dominated the remainder o f selections.
The Bank Group’s Role: There was strong consensus that the Bank should provide financial
resources for education, infrastructure, and governance; and t o stay involved. M o r e than 80
percent o f respondents believe that the Bank should maintain or increase i t s level o f involvement
in Argentina.
Effectiveness: The survey rating was relatively l o w for overall effectives (5.6 out o f lo), and there
is a disconnect between what the Bank is perceived t o be good at (infrastructure, health) and what
b o t h the Bank and respondents together believe i s most important (poverty reduction, corruption).
Lessons: The Bank suffers f r o m an image problem as a result o f i t s association with the policy
orientation o f the 1990s. Nevertheless, respondents want the Bank t o work o n challenges raised in
the survey, such as the issues o f overall effectiveness and with respect t o the priority and
effectiveness mismatch in particular. I t should also build o n its perceived strengths, including
through continued investment in infrastructure, health and the environment. Finally,
- - clear
opportunities exist t o strengthen ties with the private sector and c i v i l society.
I

CAS Consultations
85.
In addition to i t s regular contacts with NGOs, private sector and academia, in November
2005, the World Bank carried out five CAS-specific consultations with civic leaders at the
regional and national level together with a network o f Argentine NGOs (GTONG). The Country
Director and other senior staff met with business associations, trade unions, religious leaders,
journalists, NGOs, private sector representatives and academics to explore the priorities civil
society see as crucial for Argentina’s development. The consultations provided the team with a
wide range o f perspectives on key areas, and insight into where the Bank can be most strategic in
its support, including open and frank input with respect to the limits o f the Bank’s role. These
discussions build on the extensive consultations held throughout Argentina in July and August
2003 in preparation for the CAS that was presented to the Board in April 2004.

40

86.
Following are some o f the salient and common opinions expressed during the
consultations. T w o things stand out about the common themes that emerged from these
consultations. First, they are broadly consistent with the ideas and guidance expressed in 2003
(see Annex E o f 2004 CAS). Second, they also complement the themes identified in the client
research conducted for the present CAS (Annex I).

87.
One key sentiment expressed by many o f the participants was that the Bank would be
most effective by supporting Argentina’s development agenda, rather than implementing a recipe
of reforms developed in Washington. In the same context, while welcoming the Bank’s
contribution to the economic and social discourse in Argentina, many participants suggested that
the Bank exercise caution in not dominating the discussion. Others indicated that a more subtle
role would help prevent against knee-jerk resistance to positions, solely because they are
associated with the World Bank. This discussion was linked to the Bank’s operational role, with
an overwhelming number o f participants arguing that the Bank should limit support to specific
investment operations and less, if at all, to development policy lending.
88.
In terms o f where the Bank should provide support, participants from across the country
and among the different groups identified education and support for small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) as the two most important priorities for the Bank. Support to education
should focus mainly on the quality o f the system, and should address primary, secondary and
tertiary. Support to SMEs is seen as key to promote employment creation and to start developing
innovative l i n k s to enhance production. Access to credit and technical support were mentioned
as the key areas most needed by SMEs.

89.
O n more specific issues that relate to the Bank’s portfolio, the Bank’s support for
infrastructure development was widely welcomed, as well as the assistance to the income support
programs; the latter was extremely highly regarded as a major contribution, especially in the
poorer provinces o f the northern part o f the country. M o v i n g forward, many participants asked
the Bank to focus on employment creation in order to achieve real social inclusion for the
beneficiaries o f cash transfer programs.
90.
Participants also welcomed Bank support for the environment, as w e l l as assistance to
indigenous people and other marginalized groups. One interesting comment that emerged
throughout the consultations was the multicultural nature o f Argentina and how development .
policy needs to take this into account to prevent social exclusion and inequality. Related to this
in the minds o f many o f the participants was the need to address pension and social security
concerns. The Bank, it was widely thought, was well suited to establish this concern on the
country’s agenda.
91.
ICSID was mentioned a number o f times due to the economic impact that awards
rendered against Argentina might have for the country. There i s also a limited understanding o f
the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism and an impression that Argentina might face serious

41

challenges in this context. There i s finally a perception that civil society has no role or voice to
present in this forum12.
92.
Overall, many participants felt that the Government has failed to articulate where the
country is heading in the medium term, in contrast to optimism regarding the short-term. One
common theme was the sense that many felt that although the country recovered well from the
crisis o f 2001-02, i t was not clear what l i e ahead or whether there was a strategic orientation for
the development of Argentina. There was broad agreement o f the need for a highly federal
country like Argentina to establish a strategy with strong participation o f the provinces. In this
context, there was strong and broad support for the Bank to work more closely with the
provinces. Finally, as was the case in the consultations leading up to the 2004 CAS,
transparency, and governance more broadly, were prominent o n the minds o f the participants,
both in terms o f monitoring the use o f funds under World Bank projects and by demanding a
need for the Bank to finance and support institutional development.

l2Only in one I C S I D case regarding Argentina has a group o f non-governmental organization requested
participation as a third, interested, party. The Tribunal in that case, in a decision issued in M a y 2005, acknowledged
I C S I D Tribunal's inherent power to accept such requests, provided compliance with certain requirements.

IBRD Portfolio Performance

94.
At the time the Board considered the 2004 CAS, the Bank and the Government were well
advanced in tackling the serious problems in portfolio performance that arose from the crisis,
most notably a substantial drop in disbursements and over half o f pending commitments being
classified as risky. This required intense collaboration with the Government on almost every
area o f portfolio management, including ensuring adequate budgetary allocations and resolving
numerous project restructurings.
95.
The results have been in line with the targets that were set for the 2004 CAS with respect
to the investment portion o f the portfolio. Disbursements have followed the high case scenario,
with the average disbursement ratio for FY 2004-05 in the range o f 40 percent o f undisbursed
commitments per annum, Le., substantially above pre-crisis levels. The portfolio i s also
stronger. The percent o f projects at risk by amount was reduced from 84 percent in FY 2003 to
19.5 percent in FY 2005, and reached 25 percent in April 2006. Similarly, the percentage o f
problem projects declined from 36 percent in 2003 to 4 percent in FY 2005 before turning up
slightly to 8 percent in April 2006. Progress in development policy lending has been much less
strong, with some 62 percent o f projects (by amount) classified as unsatisfactory in FY 2005.
The Bank and the Government have, however, taken steps to address this problem. In March
2005, three Provincial Reform Loans were closed and the remaining tranches cancelled. These
are scheduled to be replaced with new investment operations in the same provinces. Both sides
have agreed to build o n this experience in deciding how to address the remaining outstanding
policy loans in the framework o f the new CAS.
96.
The most important challenge to continue to strengthen the investment portfolio will arise
from the increased lending volumes as the assistance strategy continues the marked shift towards
investment lending. As mentioned in the 2004 CAS, Argentina has relied heavily on project
implementation units (PIUS). As the Bank expands public investment and i t s role in the
provision o f public goods and services, a systematic and deliberate effort will be pursued in the
coming years to assist the Government to reinforce i t s capacity in the formulation and
implementation o f public investments. Although limited progress was made under the previous
CAS in mainstreaming institutional capacity and in reducing parallel project management
structures, the Government now supports this process with the view to maintain institutional
memory and to ensure that the transfer o f technology and knowledge i s in the hands o f the State
and not independent consultants.
97.
As discussed in the fiduciary assessment section, recent developments point towards
increased concerns in the fiduciary environment and i t s impact on Bank operations. The CAS
will incorporate the implementation o f a Fiduciary Action Plan aimed at addressing the increased
perceived risks derived from the prevailing control environment in Argentina.

44

H.

IFC

98.
Since the last CAS dated January 2004, IFC has committed US$533 million (including
US$175 million for syndications through the B-loan program) with efforts focused on financing
companies with strong fundamentals. IFC played an important counter-cyclical role for these
companies and aimed for demonstration effect on other investors. The commitments financed
eight projects in five diverse sectors, including agriculture, food and beverages, the financial
sector, retail, and hydrocarbons, with a focus o n backing the export sector. As o f December
2005, IFC’s committed portfolio stood at US$1.029 billion for IFC’s o w n account, and an
additional US$672 million for participants’ accounts, with o i l and gas, agribusiness, food and
beverages, and the financial sector accounting for a large part.
99.
In agriculture, IFC committed a US$lOO million loan (including US$30 million for
syndications) to a leading soy o i l export company. This was the first long-term loan to an
Argentine company since the onset o f the crisis. In food and beverages, the aggregate US$65
million term loan (including US$10 million for syndications) was provided to two leading
agribusiness exporters. One o f these beneficiaries, Molinos, for instance, was able to more than
double i t s exports. O n the environmental side, with the support o f IFC, another beneficiary, San
Miguel, has implemented the first phase o f an innovative waste treatment system for its lemon
operations. In addition, the other company, AGD, was able to complete i t s purchase program,
supporting a large network o f farmers and intermediaries in rural areas owing to IFC’s prompt
structuring o f a U S 6 0 million emergency pre-export finance seasonal facility in 2002. The
subsequent 2004 loan is supporting the expansion program. In 2005, the company processed 26
percent more than in 2002, and this should further increase by 29 percent following its capacity
expansion. The majority o f i t s revenues i s expected to come from exports.
100. IFC’s investments in the financial sector during the period included a US$25 million
warehousing loan that promoted the origination and securitization o f trade and mortgage
receivable assets, and a total o f US$47.5 million loan to support a leading local bank. I F C has
taken a leading role in important restructuring o f Banco Galicia as chair o f the creditors
committee, as w e l l as in restructurings o f Banco Hipotecario and Acindar. The restructuring o f
Banco Galicia was a critical step in the bank’s plan to improve i t s competitiveness as it emerged
from a difficult environment. I F C also made a US$40 million equity investment in a leading
retail company (when risk capital was generally scarce in the country).

101. Finally, in the o i l and gas sector, I F C provided US$255.5 million (including US$135
million for syndications, and up to US$5.5 million exposure in a risk management product) to an
Argentine branch of a leading multinational o i l and gas producer to support part o f its 2005
capital expenditure program. The syndicated loan, with a seven-year tender, the longest raised
for an Argentine borrower since the country’s economic crisis in 2001, was oversubscribed.
102. IFC has made significant progress in restructuring i t s exposure to Argentine companies,
with the exception of the public service concession projects where concerns continue that the
renegotiation process be conducted in a manner which i s perceived as fair, transparent and with
fair burden sharing among all parties. During the last CAS period, the percentage o f i t s nonperforming loans declined from 66 percent to 20 percent. The fragile situation o f the financial

45

sector, the energy crisis, and other factors such as evolution o f the price o f commodities, require
enhanced portfolio supervision beyond the recovery work on the non performing loans.
103. Looking forward, IFC will support the Bank Group assistance strategy, primarily
contributing to the pillar o f “sustained growth with equity”, in the area where I F C has
comparative advantage. Credit access by the private sector has improved over the last year,
though available credit has mainly been short term. Long-term credit available to the private
sector is increasing at a moderate pace, but is still at a l o w level to a large extent and
concentrated with the blue chip companies. In this context, I F C has been shifting i t s focus from
short-term lines, where there i s good liquidity at reasonable prices, to providing long-term
financing both for i t s own account and through i t s syndication program. For instance, this was
the case with the above mentioned agribusiness and o i l and gas sector operations.
104. In addition to providing long-term financing, IFC’s priorities for i t s direct investments
will be to provide structured finance products to companies and projects in strategic sectors with
an emphasis on groups expanding on a South-South basis and export-oriented or export
facilitating projects. Important criteria that I F C will focus on when considering new projects are
the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability aspects, as well as the track record
with respect to honoring contractual obligations. By promoting CSR, using such instruments as
IFC’s SME linkages technical assistance, I F C plans to complement the Bank’s assistance for the
second CAS pillar o f “Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion”. I F C i s also supporting ten
awardees o f i t s own from the Southern Cone Development Marketplace, organized by the Bank.
Strategic focus sectors are: oil, gas and mining; agribusiness and forestry products; and the
financial sector with a focus on high impact projects such as housing and support o f exportoriented SMEs. IFC will also consider on a selective basis projects in other high impact areas,
including the social sector and financial restructuring.

105. IFC’s ability to resume its operations in utilities i s constrained by unresolved issues in the
sector. There i s significant concern from the private sector and from potential foreign investors
with respect to the lack o f satisfactory progress in the renegotiation o f public services
concessions, as well as macro and the regulatory uncertainties and the impact thereof on
investments needed to ensure the adequacy o f supply. This is especially applicable on the energy
front in terms o f supporting capacity expansion plans and growth. While there is a compelling
need for investments in the utilities sector, I F C does not expect to be active in this area until
there is: (i)satisfactory progress on the renegotiation o f public service contracts, (ii)the
establishment o f appropriate conditions for private sector participation, and (iii)
clarity on the
regulatory framework. I F C will continue to monitor the situation closely for developments that
would trigger i t s involvement.
I.

The Role o f MIGA, WBI and ICSID
MIGA

106. MIGA’s exposure in Argentina as o f December 31, 2005 stood at US$53.5 million, or
about 1 percent of MIGA’s portfolio (exposure net o f reinsurance amounting to US$33.5 million
or about 1 percent o f MIGA’s net exposure). This exposure marks an important reduction from
the levels at the end o f FY 2001, when exposure stood at US$693.6 million and Argentina was

46

the country with the second largest exposure in MIGA’s portfolio. The fall in exposure during
these four years has been due mostly to reductions in coverage as a result o f guaranteed loans
being amortized (and where MIGA’s guarantee, in most cases, exempted the guarantee holders
from capital controls imposed in early 2002 and subsequently lifted), and cancellation o f
guarantee contracts.

107. In FY 2005 MIGA recognized a Claim to an investor for a loss incurred on expropriation
grounds for a total amount o f US$1.4 million and paid US$0.5 million o f this amount. The
remaining amount will be paid by MIGA provided a number o f contractual requirements are met
by the guarantee holder. While discussions between MIGA and the Argentine authorities are ongoing, as o f January 3 1, 2006 no agreement had yet been reached on recoveries arising from the
payment by MIGA o f a claim. Pending resolution between MIGA and the Argentine authorities,
MIGA will not b e in a position to guarantee additional foreign investment projects in Argentina.
108. In two additional projects which MIGA has guaranteed, guarantee holders have notified
MIGA that, under their interpretation, the events in early 2002 could construe a loss under the
contract o f guarantee. One case i s currently being examined by international arbitrators and, in
the other case, a resolution and final assessment i s pending.

WBI
109. Over the past five years, approximately 4,200 representatives from Argentine government
agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector participated in WBI
courses, conferences, GDLN dialogues, and other learning programs. Programs delivered in
Argentina during the previous CAS period included courses on environmental management,
infrastructure regulation, carbon finance, integrated water resource management, knowledge and
innovation, and financial services. Several o f these programs were delivered in partnership with
local training and research institutions, including the Center for Financial Stability, University o f
Buenos Aires, and the Foundation for the Environment and Natural Resources.
110, Beginning in FY 2007, Argentina i s slated to become a WBI Focus Country (1 o f 6 in
L A C ) and as such WBI will work with the Country Team to develop a program that is aligned
with the overall World Bank country assistance strategy. Focus will be o n addressing learning
and capacity development needs in the sectors where the Bank is engaged in lending activity, and
on providing access to international knowledge and experience, particularly in the context o f
ESW activities. WBI’s assistance will be primarily focused on three sectors: governance,
environment, and social assistance programs. In another selected group o f sectors (financial
servicedcapital markets, innovation policy, and infrastructure regulation), WBI will provide a
forum for policy discussion and debate, and an entry point for the Bank to remain engaged on
issues that are critical to the country’s economic and social development. WBI will also explore
opportunities to link Argentina with other middle income countries to share experience on issues
such as certification o f country systems and capacity building o f sub-national governments, and
will support potential regional or sub-regional initiatives o n issues such as infrastructure and
regional integration

ICSID
111. As o f April 2006, there were 35 arbitration proceedings instituted by foreign investors
against Argentina before ICSID (two cases have been discontinued). All o f these proceedings
have been initiated under bilateral investment treaties (BITs) concluded by Argentina during the
199Os, providing for investor-State dispute settlement under the ICSID Convention. In 32 o f
these proceedings the claimants contest the measures adopted by Argentina in 2002-the
devaluation and/or freezing o f utility tariffs-which allegedly violated investors’ rights under the
BITs. Many o f the claims concern concessions for public services and infrastructure (Annex E).
Certain o f these claims have been suspended by an agreement between the foreign investors
concerned and Argentina, as part o f the concession renegotiation process.
112. In M a y 2005 an arbitral award was rendered against Argentina in the arbitration
proceedings instituted by CMS Gas Transmission Company (CMS) against the Argentine
Republic under the ICSID Convention. CMS i s a 30 percent shareholder o f the Argentine gas
transmission company TGN, which obtained a license from the Argentine authorities to operate
in the national gas transmission market. C M S claimed that actions by the authorities in and
leading up to 2002 in essence changed the terms o f the license in a manner prejudicial to CMS’
interests. Although it ruled that there was no expropriation in this case, the arbitral tribunal did
decide that C M S suffered damages in the amount o f U S 1 3 3 . 2 million, based principally o n
findings that Argentina’s failure to abide by the terms o f the license breached the provisions o f
the US-Argentina BIT that guarantee fair and equitable treatment o f foreign investors and its socalled “umbrella clause” requiring Argentina to meet i t s obligations regarding foreign
investment, In September 2005, Argentina filed a request with ICSID for annulment o f the
award rendered in the CMS case. In accordance with the ICSID Convention, an ad hoc
Committee o f three persons has been appointed to decide Argentina’s annulment application.
This Committee has the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any o f the specific
grounds foreseen by the Convention. If the award is annulled the dispute shall, at the request o f
either party, be submitted to a new Tribunal constituted in accordance with the ICSID
Convention. If, however, the award i s upheld, it shall become final and binding on the parties.

VII. LENDING SCENARIOS AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
113. Base Case Lending. The CAS envisages a base case lending scenario o f US$3.3 billion
in performance based investment lending over the three year period covering mid-FY 2006
through mid-FY 2009. The proposed lending program i s made up exclusively o f investment
operations at the request o f the authorities. However, if the Government were to request policy
based lending and conditions for such assistance were to materialize, up to 25 percent o f the
lending envelope could be reallocated to policy based loans through normal channels o f review.
These conditions include a satisfactory macro framework, as evidenced by, for example, an
active IMF program.
114. Given the emphasis on performance and the current state o f the Government’s project
implementation capacity, which i s s t i l l recovering from years o f disuse and crisis, IBRD
exposure to Argentina could decline further over the near term. Under a set o f specific
assumptions, including a five year disbursement profile for new lending, IBRD exposure i s
projected to decline under the base case from US$6.9 billion at the end o f 2005 to US$5.9 billion
by the end o f 2008 (Table 5). However, the actual extent o f the decline will depend on several
factors, including the authorities’ performance in achieving concrete improvements in project
implementation capacity-which would be reflected in faster disbursement rates-and the fate o f
pending development policy loan tranches.
115. There was US$876 million in committed development policy lending as o f end-2005
(including the Economic Recovery Support Loan, a Health SECAL, and three provincial reform
loans). In agreement with the Government, the three provincial reform loans, which were
approved prior to the 2004 CAS, were closed on March 31 2006, and undisbursed tranches
totaling US$226 million were cancelled. These loans are planned to be replaced with new
investment operations in the provinces concerned. The commitments for these new provincial
investment loans have been included within the proposed US$3.3 billion CAS envelope. The
Bank has agreed with the Government that, given such conditions, both sides would seek to build
on the experience o f replacing the PRLs in deciding how to address the remaining outstanding
policy loans in the framework o f the new CAS. Were the conditions to occur that would trigger
the disbursement o f the remaining US$650 million in existing development policy loans, Bank
exposure would decline more slowly than projected in Table 5.

116. Low Case. There i s also a range o f low-case scenarios depending o n broader economic
developments and portfolio performance. The spectrum o f possible scenarios includes the
possibility o f an abrupt and severe deterioration o f the macroeconomic environment, Le., a hard
landing leading to a significant reduction in fiscal space for public investment. Another scenario
would involve continued macroeconomic stability and growth, but an unexpected, significant
decline in portfolio performance, perhaps arising from a sharp increase in fiduciary risks. Either
o f these two scenarios would lead to a substantial reduction in new Bank lending. I t i s not
possible to pinpoint a priori what level o f Bank investment lending would b e appropriate across
the range o f low-case scenarios. In practice, Bank support will be calibrated to government
performance and economic outcomes, leading in effect to automatic adjustments in the size and
pace o f new investment lending.
117. Argentina CAS Triggers. Box 6 below sets out the triggers corresponding to the base
case lending program described above.

VIII. IMPLEMENTING THE CAS
A.

Partnerships

1.18. International Monetary Fund. On January 3, 2006 Argentina prepaid its entire
outstanding obligations to the IMF, amounting to SDR 6.7 billion (about US$9.7 billion) and
canceled the September 2003 Stand-By Arrangement. Argentina has indicated that it expects to
maintain normal relations with the Fund. By way o f background, the second review o f the
Stand-By Arrangement agreed between the Government and the IMF in September 2003 (SDR
8,981 billion) was completed in March 2004. However, the third review was postponed
indefinitely by the Government in August 2004. Following the closing o f the debt exchange
offer in June 2005, the Government and the Fund held Article I V discussions in Washington, and
the report was issued in June 2005. The report noted the rapid recovery and political stability
that has prevailed since the crisis, but observed that inflation emerged as a short term risk, noted
the lack o f progress on structural reforms and toward arriving at a forward looking strategy to
address remaining arrears to private sector creditors, and cautioned that a slowing o f growth can
be expected as capacity constraints are reached. Between 2002 and September 2005, Argentina
made some SDR10.3 billion in repayments to the IMF (about US$14.9 billion).

119. Inter-American Development Bank. IADB’s country strategy for Argentina for 20042008, approved in November 2004, sets the guidelines for the IADB to support the
Government’s development priorities in the areas o f governance, competitiveness and poverty
reduction, within a framework o f macroeconomic stability. The target lending scenario amounts
to US$5 billion over the five-year period and entails a higher concentration in investment loans.
In this scenario, the IADB’s exposure in Argentina would remain virtually unchanged.
120. Implementation o f the strategy during the past year has focused on actions to improve
portfolio execution and to expedite the country’s transition from emergency interventions to a
more comprehensive and sustainable social inclusion policy. To that end, in December 2004 the
IADB approved a US$500 million policy based loan to create the conditions for a consolidation
of social safety-net programs implemented during the emergency. This loan was to b e followed
by a string o f investment programs aimed at strengthening the provision o f basic social services
and by a US$700 million investment loan to support the design and implementation o f Plan
Familias, a program o f conditional subsidies targeting poor and indigent families. The latter was
approved in late October 2005. In March 2006, the IADB approved a US$500 m i l l i o n policy
based loan that seeks to improve public financial management.
121. An update o f the Country Strategy for Argentina i s currently under preparation for
presentation to the Board o f Directors in mid-2006. This update will assess progress in the areas
defined in the country strategy, in particular, portfolio execution, mid term public investment
program and reform agenda, and based o n that, will further specify the areas where IADB
resources should be channeled for the 2006-2008 period.

51

Box 7: World Bank-IADB Collaboration

The L a t i n America and Caribbean vice presidency o f the Bank and the IADB continue to advance collaboration and
coordination formalized in two memoranda o f understanding (2001 and 2004). Specific areas o f cooperation
identified by the B a n k and the IADB include reciprocal representation in each others’ Boards; periodic consultations
at the senior management level and other consultations, country-specific cooperation, including the j o i n t financing
o f selected projects, and cooperation with respect to selected themes and sectors. These include, among others,
fiduciary assessments, regional integration, the environment and rural development, and w o r k related t o
infrastructure, and analytical studies. B a n k - I A D B collaboration in Argentina has been effective in these and other
areas. Below are some examples.
Infrastructure: G o o d collaboration i s underway between the t w o institutions with respect t o road network
management and improving Argentina’s competitiveness through enhanced transport logistics both within Argentina
and across its borders. Productive collaboration has also been achieved in ensuring the fiscal sustainability o f
infrastructure investments, particularly at the provincial level. In the Buenos Aires Province Sustainable Investment
Development project, for example, the Bank prepared the fiscal framework which accompanied the loan, and has
worked closely with the IADB in order to apply the same fiscal framework for their social investment loan in the
same province. The two institutions have combined efforts to monitor jointly implementation o f the provincial
fiscal framework throughout the lifespan o f the projects.
Social Protection: Collaboration between the Bank and IADB i s expanding, and supports some o f the most critical
elements o f the country’s development agenda. One k e y example i s the transition f r o m the Heads o f Household
emergency project, which will focus o n reintegrating beneficiaries into the labor market. A US$350 m i l l i o n W o r l d
Bank loan to support the workfare part o f the program and the provision o f employment services to eligible
participants was presented t o the Board o n M a r c h 23, 2006 under the 2004 CAS. Heads o f Household beneficiaries
with two o r more children are to transfer t o the Familias conditional cash transfer program which aims to prevent
the inter-generational transmission o f poverty by linking the income transfer to education and health investments in
children. In October 2005, the IADB approved a US$700 m i l l i o n loan t o fmance the expansion and implementation
o f Familias.

Rural Development and Environment: The Bank and IADB are collaborating in the f o r m o f j o i n t financing o f the
unit within the Secretariat o f Agriculture supporting provincial investments in agricultural services and irrigation.
B o t h institutions are also working t o provide assistance t o Argentina in the area o f solid waste management, and are
applying the same eligibility criteria for municipal and provincial borrowing in complementary loans.
Public Sector Management: The two institutions have worked closely with the Argentine authorities over the past
decade to help municipal governments enhance basic public management skills, rebuild deteriorated infrastructure,
and mobilize resources needed for public investment. The Bank and IADB coordinated with authorities at the
federal and subnational level to ensure that a l l eligible provinces were covered, working separately in some
provinces and together in the four largest, Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Mendoza and Santa Fe.
Financial Management: The Bank and IADB are working together o n CFAAs, and substantial benefits have been
gained through the use of the same procurement procedures.
Private Sector: IFC has coordinated closely with the private sector department o f the IADB and developed a joint
approach in projects in which both institutions had investments.

B.

Fiduciary Assessment

122. The overall Bank portfolio fiduciary risk has increased from moderate at the time o f the
2004 CAS to substantial in late 2005. The financial management portfolio risk i s moderate at
federal level and ranges from moderate to substantial at sub-national level, depending on the
institutional capacities o f each Province. The procurement portfolio risk i s substantial at both
federal and sub-national levels. This assessment takes into consideration past and current
diagnostics o f country public financial management (FM) and procurement, the structure o f the
Bank’s portfolio and i t s shift towards increased investment lending with renewed emphasis on
the sub-national level, and the continuing exclusive reliance on Bank fiduciary systems for
project implementation in Argentina. The heightened fiduciary risk i s largely a result o f the
impact o f the crisis, which weakened the overall control environment by introducing increased
fragmentation o f procurement rules and budget execution, and from the limited progress
obtained in implementing the proposed regulatory and institutional reforms. To deal with this
increased fiduciary risk, the Bank will implement during the coming years a fiduciary action plan
which will aim to: (i)
increase the transparency in Bank financed projects and create incentives
for civil society organizations to monitor and evaluate Bank portfolio performance; (ii)
improve
the strategic focus and coverage o f existing Bank supervision tools geared towards evaluating
fiduciary risks in our operations; and (iii)ensure increased transparency and competition
practices in public procurement. Discussions have been initiated with the Government, the audit
authority and civil society groups to ensure their involvement in the various components o f the
Fiduciary Action Plan, and to work together toward achieving the expected outcomes.
123. Financial Management. At the federal level, a perceived weak control environment,
derived mostly from the limited effectiveness o f the institutional checks and balances, has
reduced the effectiveness o f otherwise sound legal and systemic frameworks-including
integrated budgeting, treasury and accounting functions, and automated information processing
through the SIDIF system. The limited capacity o f control entities contributed to lower rule
enforcement and incentives for accountability.
124. At the sub-national level, the FM systems used by highly autonomous and decentralized
governmental units are generally perceived to be weaker than those at the federal level.
Nevertheless, there i s a high degree o f variance among the financial management capacity o f sub
national governments. The assessment o f sub-national entities i s based mostly on the Bank’s
fiduciary work linked to project development and implementation. Specific analytical work to
provide a more systematic assessment o f financial management risks at the provincial level i s
planned for FY 2007. Overall, the high degree o f dependence from federal resources at the subnational level constitutes a disincentive for accountability and fiscal discipline.
125. Within the framework o f the Country Fiduciary Action Plan, a dialogue was developed
between the Bank, the Ministry o f Economy and AGN to improve the current level o f audit
compliance for the portfolio. The compliance target for the 2005 audit i s 65 percent o f timely
delivery. The overall objective for the new CAS period (2006-2009) i s 85 percent. Measures to
improve level o f compliance include (i)
more efficient planning and use o f AGN resources, (ii)
use o f private sector audit to complement AGN resources when necessary (this option has been
implementation o f the pilot operation
utilized this year with regards to two projects) and (iii)
(Bank IDF grant) to improve AGN efficiency. Causes o f non compliance will be analyzed and
53

appropriate corrective measures will be taken in accordance with relevant Bank policies, in
particular OP-BP 10.02.
126. Fiduciary analytical work. The Bank will also address fiduciary risk through a multiannual program o f fiduciary analytical work aimed at strengthening the policy dialogue in
financial management and procurement sectors (particularly at the provincial level) and raising
general awareness. This program will consist o f (i)federal level C F A A and CPAR; (ii)
provincial level financial management and procurement ESW; (iii)
policy notes o n specific areas
of interest to the Government; and (iv) an Accounting and Auditing ROSC. These analytical
products will be conducted in close coordination among all relevant sectors. The main emphases
of the federal level CFAA, currently in progress, will include the assessment o f the control
environment, aid management and the budget process. In FY 2007 provincial level PFM and
procurement ESW will aim to design relevant indicators and measure fiduciary performance at
the sub-national level. The Bank will aim at conducting the provincial ESW jointly with the
Government. The Accounting and Auditing ROSC will review Argentina’s private sector
accounting and auditing practices, with emphasis on compliance with international standards and
codes.
127. Procurement. Country procurement rules and practices are fragmented. Separate
statutes govern the procurement o f (i)
goods and services, (ii)
civil works and (iii)
consultants,
The new procurement law13 was originally adopted in 2001 and amended in 2003.14 I t contains
policies and guidelines which are, by and large, consistent with Bank procurement policies.
There has been limited action, however, to implement the new law and the issuance o f the
regulations required to bring the law into full force i s still pending. An Electronic Government
Procurement system has also been developed and tested at the pilot level. However, i t s scope o f
application i s limited mostly to recurrent government supplies. The Bank has stepped up efforts
to monitor the impact o f competition and transparency conditions o f procurement under Bank
projects, and to act quickly to engage the authorities when necessary.

Box 8: Fiduciary Action Plan
The objective o f the Plan i s to ensure effective management o f the increased risk in Argentina’s fiduciary
performance by increasing public information o n Bank financed projects, promoting c i v i l society participation in the
monitoring and evaluation o f the Bank’s portfolio, enhancing the strategic focus and coverage o f B a n k supervision
tools geared toward evaluating fiduciary risks in operations, and ensuring increased transparency and competition
practices in public procurement. The Fiduciary Action Plan will consist o f the following m a i n components:
Raising Public Awareness
Extensive disclosure of project procurement information to the public via the Bank’s external web site.
All contractsfinanced by the Bank for each project will be included in a data base including: (i)
Contract
objectives and procurement method; (ii)
estimated and actual cost o f contracts and level o f execution; (iii)
estimated and actual date o f contract award; (iv) bidders and contractor; and (v) m a i n contract changes.
The information will be presented in a user friendly manner for general public use.
Outreach to civil society with regard to implementation/impact analysis of World Bank portfolio. This
component will seek to elicit involvement by c i v i l society organizations and think tanks dealing with
transparency, public goods and related areas in the monitoring a n d o r evaluation o f the Bank’s portfolio.
Stimulate civil society and development partners’ involvement on fiduciary matters: (i)
M a k e public
aware o f the existence o f ‘whistle-blowers’ mechanisms such as the B a n k international hotline to report
incidents o f corruption; (ii)
Intensify relations with NGO dealing with transparency matters; (iii)
Enhance
the fiduciary coordination and harmonization effort with IDB.
BolsterinP Bank Fiduciarv Monitoring
Improve timeliness of external audit compliance for Bank supported operations with on-time compliance
targets of 60 percent in F Y 2006, 75 percent in F Y 2007 and 80 percent in F Y 2008. Meeting this target
will require: (i)
continued engagement with the Supreme Audit Authority reflected in Audit Plans for each
fiscal year completed by end November in each year containing timetable for audit completion o f Bank
financed operations, level o f private sector support and budget requirements; and (ii)
continued support to
AGN efforts to enhance i t s capacity to ensure timely and quality audit performance and effective follow up
o n audit recommendations.
Increase strategic focus and coverage of supewision tools assessing fiduciary risk in operations: (i)
Undertake integrated fiduciary risk assessments for each project in the portfolio with a target to cover 75
percent o f portfolio in C Y 0 6 and 100 percent in CY07; (ii)
Establish a traffic light rating system reflecting
the fiduciary risk o f each project in the portfolio and publish the relevant information o n the Bank’s
external web; (iii)Produce and publish an annual report o n fiduciary risk o f the B a n k portfolio to be
disseminated to the Government, as w e l l as t o key actors in the control community and c i v i l society groups;
and (iv) Continue t o share with the Integrity Department the fiduciary assessments, and seek theiI
participation in high risk cases where irregularities are identified.
Further complementary actions: (i)
Deliver training by the end o f FY 2006 t o a l l relevant Bank staff on
procurement and financial management matters related t o the current fiduciary risks faced by the Argentina
portfolio, and familiarize staff with the fiduciary challenges faced across the portfolio; (ii)Supporl
strengthening o f oversight institutions through grant assistance and knowledge sharing; (iii)Supporl
streamlining and harmonization o f fiduciary processes and reliance o n country systems when these meei
adequate fiduciary standards.
Increase Transparency and Competition Practices in Public Procurement
Establish a proactive dialogue with the Government and relevant agencies to improve transparency ana
implement (by end CY06) a price monitoring
procurement practices in public procurement, including: (i)
mechanism and alert system based o n reliable and up to date cost-estimates; (ii)
reach understandings with
the Government o n contract aggregation strategies that will improve competition and innovation. This will
include analytical w o r k t o have a better grasp o f current market and competition conditions; (iii)
promote
the use o f transparency instruments such as integrity pacts, public hearings and comparative prices; and (iv:
continue to apply a zero tolerance policy in the investigation o f perceived irregular practices anc
application o f a l l available remedies.

55

C.

Country Financing Parameters

128. The Government agreed to the new Country Financing Parameters in early 2005 (Annex
J), and has welcomed the increased flexibility that the new Bank policy provides with regard to
eligible expenditures. However, the degree to which the Government would like to use the
increased flexibility depends largely on i t s strategy for funding development needs. The degree
to which the Bank will use the increased flexibility will in turn depend on the Bank’ overall
exposure, as w e l l as the impact on the Bank’s ability to find other projects under the CAS and
the potential to reduce transaction costs.
129. In terms o f cost sharing, the new parameters propose flexibility for the Bank to finance
up to 100 percent of total project costs, when this would result in substantially reduced
transaction costs and in a substantial impact on poverty alleviation. In other cases, flexibility in
cost sharing will depend upon the Bank’s overall lending envelope, and subject to satisfactory
ownership o f the overall program and at the sector level. The Bank’s financing share o f
individual projects i s however expected to continue at current levels.
130. With regard to Bank financing of recurrent costs, the new parameters propose no countrylevel limit. From an economic perspective, sound fiscal management and the fact that Bank
financing is fully integrated in the budget and taken into account in fiscal and debt targets
indicate that financing o f recurrent costs would not jeopardize overall fiscal or debt
sustainability. Therefore, no country-level limit on recurrent cost financing i s proposed. From a
project perspective, financing o f recurrent costs under Bank projects i s likely to continue to take
place only in exceptional cases, although in the future increased flexibility may be applied when
there are special emergency and proj ect-related circumstances.
131. In terms of local cost financing, the requirements for Bank financing o f local
expenditures are met, and the new parameters allow financing o f local costs in the proportion
needed in individual projects. The change in policy i s not expected to represent a major
deviation from the prevailing practice in local cost financing in Argentina, since the Bank has
been financing substantial local costs in the past. With respect to taxes and duties, the new
financing parameters allow the Bank to finance all taxes and duties associated with project
expenditures with the exception o f import tariffs above 28 percent, which i s the average o f the
Mercosur common external tariff. At the project level, the Bank would also consider whether
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share o f project costs.

D.

IBRD Financial Products

132. IBRD offers a fill array o f financing and risk management products. The IBRD financial
products could provide flexibility to Argentina in managing i t s debt, including the ability to
change the financial characteristics o f existing and future loans as to better manage the financial
risks relating to currency, interest rate, rollover and commodity price volatility. Thus, and for
instance, Argentina has a substantial portfolio o f F S L loans with the IBRD, but i s yet to take
advantage o f the embedded risk management tools included in the FSLs to manage currency and
interest rate risks. Furthermore, and since Argentina also has a considerable portfolio o f V S L
loans, the Government might want to consider signing an I S D A Agreement with IBRD, thus
gaining access to a range o f IBRD financial products to manage the interest rate and currency

56

risks o f these VSL loans. Within this context, the Government may want to consider engaging
staff o f the World Bank’s Treasury to become better aware o f I B R D ’ s financial products and
services available to it, and may also want to consider taking advantage o f IBRD’s technical
assistance in designing and implementing a broad strategy for public debt management aimed at
reducing both market risks and overall costs o f funding.

E.

CAS Results Framework

133. In keeping with the focus on evaluating CASs based on results linked directly to Bank
support, the indicators for the investment program are largely derived from the development
outcomes already agreed with the authorities under key activities. The Results Matrix also
includes indicators on portfolio performance. The results framework o f this CAS i s based on the
following four elements.
0

0

0

0

F.

The Bank’s dialogue with the Government i s focused on projects, and with clearly
identified Government counterparts. At the project level, supervision dialogue will be at
the sector level and be led by Buenos Aires based sector staff. The broader dialogue,
particularly with respect to the overall portfolio management, will take place between the
C M U and the Ministry o f Economy and Production, and revolve around twice-yearly
portfolio reviews.
The indicators which have been selected for use in the Results Matrix and elsewhere have
been chosen on the basis o f their effectiveness to demonstrate progress and outcomes as
well as their availability to the Government. The data exist and should prove robust to
provide a clear picture o f where Argentina stands with respect to various indicators. At
this stage, the Results Matrix features mainly quantitative indicators-reflecting the early
stage o f development o f the new investment partnership with Argentina. As the
investment program matures, additional emphasis will be given to identifying robust and
measurable indicators o f investment quality and impact.
Primary responsibility for statistics within the Government i s with I N D E C and the line
ministries; in the Bank responsibility resides with the task teams. The Bank i s planning
to provide technical assistance to Argentina to address shortcomings in statistical
capacity where they exist (e.g., on poverty, in the three phase Programmatic Poverty
study).
Given uncertainty about Argentina’s policy framework, especially in outer years o f the
CAS, the results o f new activities cannot yet be specified. The Bank will further
delineate the country results framework as data becomes available, including the
introduction o f additional quality based indicators as feasible, and will provide an update
in the CAS Progress Report. Management also proposes to provide regular briefings to
the Board on economic developments and the medium t e r m outlook.
Risk Management

134. Argentina faces a number o f difficult challenges, and effective Bank support to Argentina
faces a number o f important risks, across a range o f areas. M a n y o f these are risks that were
pointed out in the last CAS, and many have been identified by the Government as recently as
early 2005 in the prospectus for the sovereign debt exchange offer.

57

Economic and Social Risks

135. Inflation is the key macroeconomic policy concern in the short run. The inflation rate at
the end o f 2005 o f 12.3 percent for the CPI represents a three-fold increase since 2003 and
inflationary expectations have increased sharply. The outlook i s for inflation to remain in double
digits in 2006. The Government i s relying on a combination o f price agreements and increased
investment to contain inflation. However, the rise in inflationary pressures i s generalized, in part
reflecting the closing o f the output gap during the robust three year recovery as well as robust
domestic and external demand, and i s likely to require significant tightening o f macroeconomic
policies. A delayed policy response raises the risk of accelerating inflation and eroding
competitiveness, thereby increasing the likelihood o f a hard economic landing which-if history
i s a guide-would likely disproportionately hurt poor and vulnerable groups.
136. The risk of a sharp slowdown in growth remains the main medium-term concern.
Argentina’s economy will not continue to grow at current rates o f 9 percent per year indefinitely.
Indeed, as the Government stated in i t s prospectus for the debt exchange, the country’s history o f
volatility and protracted periods o f l o w or negative growth indicate that a substantial slowdown
cannot be discounted.
Economic growth depends on a range o f factors, including
macroeconomic stability, the investment climate, the external environment, and confidence in
public institutions. Pursuit o f a determined reform agenda by the Government to support
progress in these areas-including fiscal reforms to underpin the primary surplus and reforms to
restore financial intermediation and promote private participation in public services and
infrastructure-would help to sustain growth and limit the negative effects o f any future internal
or external shocks.
Conversely, in the absence o f further reforms, the medium-term
sustainability o f growth i s at risk.
137. Notwithstanding the debt restructuring o f June 2005 and the overall improvement in
Argentina’s debt profile, debt sustainability will remain a concern and an important source o f
risk. Even after the debt restructuring and repayment to the IMF, Argentina’s total public debt
remains high and the public debt service burden in the medium term significant, in the US$13
billion range per year. The US$24 billion in holdouts, US$3 billion in Paris club arrears, and
contingent liabilities arising from the cases before ICSID all represent sources o f potential
increases in the debt service burden in the future, although the timetable for their resolution
remains unclear. The 35 percent reduction in international reserves resulting from the early
repayment o f the IMF reduced the country’s external liquidity, but reserves remain adequate to
cover 100 percent of the money base and are again accumulating with continued Central Bank
purchases o f foreign exchange. Under the Government’s medium-term macroeconomic
framework, the public debt to GDP ratio i s projected to decline steadily over the medium-term.
Rollover rates on debt to private creditors are projected to be on the order o f 100 percent in
2007-08. A scenario in which delayed structural reform contributes to a slowdown in growth
could put pressure o n fiscal performance, forestall a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, and
increase the rollover risk.
138. Poverty and unemployment, while improved significantly since the depths o f the crisis,
remain deep structural problems for Argentina. Street protests, the piquetero movement,
concerns about crime and violence, and a weakened sense o f security that has emerged in
Argentina since the crisis could conceivably make i t politically difficult for the Government to

58

pursue economic reforms and generate renewed popular demands vis-a-vis Argentina’s public
debt, especially if the economy were to slow substantially and recent positive trends in poverty
and unemployment were to reverse.
139. Argentina remains vulnerable to adverse changes in the international environment.
Rising global interest rates or a fall in the price o f i t s primary commodities could have a
pronounced effect on the country’s growth prospects. A slowing o f growth in i t s primary export
markets, such as Brazil or China, could also affect Argentina.
Political Risks

140. President Kirchner’s popular support and political strength were fortified as a result o f
the October 2005 legislative elections. The Administration appears to be in a solid position for
the time being. Nevertheless, Argentina’s history suggests that political fortunes can fluctuate
suddenly and substantially. With its current level o f support, the Administration has not sought
to engage in extensive consultation and debate with the broader civil and political society, raising
the possibility o f sharper political divisions. Presidential elections are slated for 2007, raising the
possibility that, within the CAS period, the emergence o f a campaign environment could distract
senior officials and make the development challenges presented in Section I V o f the CAS more
difficult to tackle.
Bank Group Program Risks

141. The Bank faces a number o f important risks in Argentina, in the policy environment, in
terms o f project implementation, and with respect to fiduciary management.
0

0

Policy Environment Risks. The Bank faces two major policy challenges in Argentina.
The first challenge relates to the medium term framework. The Government’s view i s
that i t s development agenda, as presented in Section I11 above and further elaborated in
Annex A, i s adequate to ensure sustained growth over the period o f the CAS and beyond.
W h i l e acknowledging the track record o f three years o f strong growth since the crisis, the
Bank remains concerned with the wide range o f possible macroeconomic outcomes as a
finction o f the policies the Government actually implements in practice. The second
challenge i s the limited policy dialogue with the Government on overall economic
management and structural reform. There are opportunities for the Bank to exchange
views with the authorities, as for example during preparation o f the CAS itself; however,
the degree o f consensus on key issues remains limited. The uncertainty that results from
these two challenges has important implications for the Bank’s operations. The CAS i s
designed specifically to respond to this uncertainty and seeks to mitigate the first o f these
risks by presenting an all investment lending program with clear triggers on the
macroeconomic framework and portfolio performance. I t also addresses the second risk,
the limited policy dialogue, by setting out an active AAA agenda that will seek out
opportunities to build engagement on issues crucial to Argentina’s development where
there i s not yet a consensus between the Government and the Bank.
Project Implementation Risks. The shift to a performance based investment led CAS in
a country with limited project implementation capacity presents the risk that the Bank
will not be able to maintain a consistent positive net flow o f resources with Argentina.

59

0

0

This could result in tension between the Bank and the authorities. The CAS includes a
number o f areas that will seek to mitigate these risks. First, the Bank is working with the
Government on a framework o f principles that would guide a progressive shift o f
personnel from PIUs to line ministries. Second, the Government i s undertaking
initiatives aimed at building up institutional capacity to respond to the requirements
posed by the scaling up o f the public investment program. The Bank’s program features
a number of institutional strengthening projects that aim to assist the authorities to
improve administrative capacity to manage public investment, for example, the Buenos
Aires Sustainable Infrastructure Development project. A delay or failure to build
additional institutional capacity could lead to project implementation constraints and a
slowdown o f disbursements.
Fiduciary Risks. The control environment has been evaluated as fragile in the most
recent fiduciary assessments. Contributing factors include: (i)
a complex budget structure
with exceptions such as fiduciary finds and inter-governmental fiscal mechanisms with a
a civil service which faces difficulties to attract
significant degree o f discretionality, (ii)
and retain professional staff, and (iii)
limited effectiveness o f institutional checks and
balances at both the federal and provincial levels. The shift towards a 100 percent
investment partnership, as proposed under the CAS, will place increasing demands on the
control environment to ensure the fiduciary adequacy o f projects. The fiduciary action
plan agreed with the Government is designed to mitigate fiduciary risks and offset the
perceived fragilities in the control environment through a focus on increased transparency
and accountability.
IFC Portfolio Risk. There i s a risk that the quality and level o f IFC’s Argentina portfolio
may decline over the short-to-medium term should one or more o f the following concerns
materialize. They are: (i)a negative evolution o f the investment climate, including
continued impasse in the renegotiation o f the public service concessions; (ii)a
considerable drop in commodity prices; and (iii)
real foreign exchange rate appreciation.
The investment climate would affect IFC’s ability to continue to increase i t s long term
lending activity to Argentine companies while commodity prices and real foreign
exchange rate appreciation could affect the performance o f IFC’s portfolio clients that are
primarily commodity-based and/or export-oriented.

General Principles

Argentina’s economy has initiated a process o f sustained growth. What was
initially interpreted by analysts as a temporary recovery may already be considered the
start o f a new stage in the mode o f operation o f the country’s economy. Fiscal discipline,
reduction o f the debt burden, monetary prudence, external surplus, increased reserves,
vigorous growth and exports diversification, greater productive investment, reversal o f
capital flight, creation o f millions o f genuine jobs, recovery o f the purchasing power o f
salaries, reduction o f poverty and indigence, commencement o f reversing the
deterioration in income distribution, these are only some o f the characteristic features that
mark the start o f this new stage that should result in a genuine development process to
leave behind long years o f persistent decline.
Under the premise that foreign policy and international economic relations are
inseparably linked to who we are as a country and to the type o f country we wish to
build, Argentina participates in an active and constructive manner in favor o f a more
balanced new world order, capable o f taking into consideration the interests and needs o f
developing countries, able to guarantee a sustainable development strategy with social
inclusion. W e foster the opening o f the country to the world in a realistic manner, within
the framework of deepening regional integration policies, in particular through the
MERCOSUR, in the understanding that said framework i s the best strategic answer to
drive regional development and confront the new challenges stemming from
globalization and technological and scientific progress. To that end it is indispensable to
be integrated into the world, emphasizing the absolute advantages o f national production
and within a framework o f regional integration.
Our Latin American policy seeks to consolidate a network o f physical,
commercial and cultural relations on a par with the excellent political dialogue that we
hold with all sister countries. In that context, the recent agreements made with our major
partner in MERCOSUR, reflected in the competitive adjustment mechanism, will enable
a healthy integration o f production and a well-balanced and dynamic expansion o f
regional trade. Such agreements are an eloquent sign o f the priority our Administration
attaches to the process o f reindustrializing the country and recovering the original spirit
that guided the design o f the first integration agreements. MERCOSUR, at the recent M a r
del Plata summit, gave a true example o f unity, cohesion and defense o f the regional
interests, which points to medium and long t e r m foreign economic policy guidelines in an
open economy such as Argentina’s.
In terms o f international financial relations, the margin o f maneuver and degrees
o f freedom recovered as a consequence o f the restructuring o f the foreign debt will make
i t possible to develop a responsible policy. Argentina lost its place among the prosperous
nations decades ago and it i s still an impoverished country. This situation i s the starting
point to begin reversing history and reinstating once again the notion o f progress and
social cohesion in our homeland.

62

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

A key long term policy objective i s securing an efficient energy supply to satisfy
the demand generated by the sustained growth o f GDP that has and will continue being
recorded in the coming years. The medium term measures that are contemplated include
the installation of 1,600 megawatts through mixed investments by the generators and the
National State; the partial raising o f the level and completion o f the Yacyreth dam
complex, the completion o f the Atucha I1Nuclear Power Plant and the expansion o f the
high voltage electric power transmission system, to which end there are plans for the
construction o f approximately 4,550 kilometers o f 500 kV lines, representing an
expansion o f the existing facilities by over 43 percent. There are regional projects for the
sector such as the “Energy Ring”, a joint initiative o f the Governments o f Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, with Bolivia participating as an observer, and
the “Natural Gas Interconnection - Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela” destined to
establish a South American network o f gas pipelines. The Northeast Argentine Gas
pipeline, for i t s part, i s a bilateral initiative between the Governments o f Argentina and
Bolivia that has the capacity o f reasonably complementing our country’s supply, by
permitting the provinces o f Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa and Misiones to incorporate,
once and for all, the use o f natural gas in their territory, with the improved quality o f life
that this implies, and that the provinces o f Cordoba, Entre Nos, Salta and Santa Fe see an
improvement in their level o f gas supply.
In terms o f public services and the corresponding renegotiations o f the contracts,
the policy adopted incorporates into the profit equation-logical in any business-criteria
such as: the defense o f public interests, the defense o f citizens and the defense o f public
service users; with a view to contracts that ensure the best possible service, their
universal extension and increased investments to accompany the country’s growth. As a
result o f this negotiation the competitiveness o f our economy will be enhanced, jobs will
be created and adequate services will be provided making a profit for the companies
involved. The objective being sought is to make public and private interests compatible,
something which could be facilitated if those who represent the concessionaires take a
look at the numbers o f our recovery and the future flows o f revenues and profits.

The state will perform its core role as social articulator but also, with the
Millennium Development Goals as a target, we will strengthen the capacity o f society as
a whole to exercise social responsibility. Although initially, in view o f the seriousness o f
the situation we faced, it was necessary to continue with plans designed to respond to the
emergency, we have gradually developed initiatives designed for social inclusion, to
repair and rebuilt the social fabric, enabling many Argentines to recover their projects
and life. In that sense, the objective i s to promote individual and collective social
development; whereas assistentialism produced clients, insertion should promote
citizenship. The intent i s to reduce gradually direct aid and assistance systems to a
minimum, because we believe employment to be a collective aspiration.
The long term strategy can be characterized as one o f economic development with
inclusion and implies promoting investment and a continuous increase o f productivity
through a dense innovation network that makes i t possible to add to the production

63

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

processes skilled labor and innovations based on research and development. To this end,
the work o f institutional reconstruction will continue to strengthen the role o f the state,
endow i t with high skills and a fill-fledged vocation o f service, ensuring stable rules o f
the game for everyone and the effective possibility o f meeting the contractual
commitments that are undertaken.
But economic development should be-above all else-synonymous o f equity in
the distribution of the h i t s o f economic growth through the sustained creation o f
opportunities for genuine employment and the continuous improvement o f incomes, not
as a result o f an always elusive “trickle down” o f said fruits, but as an indispensable
prerequisite for the start up and realization o f growth itself. These are the mainstays o f
the current medium and long term policy framework.

B.

Short and Medium Term Development Objectives

After the successful conclusion o f the debt restructuring process, the current phase
of consolidation o f sustained growth aims for three fundamental objectives: (a)
preserving price stability, (b) sustaining the competitiveness o f domestic production and,
based on these two, (c) continuing and accelerating the process o f recuperation o f the
difficult social situation.
In terms of the first objective, the Government i s acting firmly to preserve the
l o w inflation environment that characterized the stage o f recovery from the crisis, which
will make i t possible for relative prices to play an adequate role in the process o f resource
allocation. To that end, a set o f policies has been implemented that may be divided into
two groups: (i)
those that relate to the inter-temporal consistency o f the current program
and (ii)those designed to confront mechanisms that could contribute to a price
acceleration in an open small economy, even in a context o f fiscal and external balance.

Among the former we may mention the role o f the fiscal, monetary and external
policies that have been implemented since the collapse o f the Convertibility regime,
designed to disactivate the fundamental mechanisms o f the inflation phenomenon. There
i s no doubt that the strong macroeconomic imbalances that characterized our country
during the last decades had a preponderant role in the development o f the high inflation
regime that afflicted the Republic o f Argentina for so long. In the new macroeconomic
environment, not only has there been a significant improvement in the condition o f the
public accounts based o n fiscal discipline, but also and furthermore, starting with the
successful restructuring o f the public debt, the road became open to ensure inter-temporal
fiscal stability. O n the external front, the new relative prices have translated into
substantial current account surpluses, after having suffered systematic deficits during the
1990’s. At the same time, the new macro context has led to a systematic reduction o f
private capital outflows. B o t h developments allowed for an important accumulation o f
reserves by the Central Bank o f Argentina (in Spanish, Banco Central de la Repziblica
Argentina - BCRA) that contributed to significantly improving the soundness o f the
economic system.

64

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

The current stock o f reserves, within the framework o f a policy o f reducing public
sector debt, made i t possible to decide to pay o f f the total debt that our country owed to
the International Monetary Fund. Thanks to this operation, there will be financial savings
estimated around US$800 million, resulting from the difference between the interest rate
as agreed with said institution and the yield on international reserves held by the B C R A
for the almost US$10 billion involved in the transaction.
Regarding the second group of policies, a series o f reasons that justify an active
economic policy response may be noted. Firstly, in a context o f strong economic growth
with expansion o f employment and rising salaries, i t i s not surprising to have a vigorous
recovery o f consumption. Under this circumstance, the response by the National
Government i s based on promoting and stimulating a higher rate o f investment,
contributing to increase the economy’s growth potential.
Secondly, the requisite increase in the degree o f tradability o f some food products
in a context o f a favorable real exchange rate also induces price increases, to which we
should add that an eventual rise in international prices could generate a phenomenon o f
“imported inflation,” not originating in an excessive domestic demand. The policies
implemented to minimize this impact on prices include the establishment o f export taxes,
which have made it possible to mitigate the effect o f the greater tradability on domestic
prices. At the same time, the policy o f voluntary price agreements has managed to
smooth the impact o f the volatility o f such prices on the Consumer Price Index (CPI.)

Thirdly, after the sharp change in relative prices that took place in 2002, the prices
o f some non-tradable products (basically services) have lagged behind those o f tradables.
To the extent that growth has began to extend to all sectors o f the economy in general,
this “overshooting” should tend to be compensated through transitory price increases in
those sectors that lagged behind; such adjustment will lose impetus on i t s own as relative
prices complete their adjustment to the new equilibrium.
Finally, in an economy with a long “inflation history” such as Argentina’s and
with a production structure that in some sectors i s characterized by a certain degree o f
concentration and corresponding market power, the possible inertia effects on the
evolution o f prices o f expectations for price increases o n the part o f price makers should
not be minimized. This problem has been tacked on several fronts: first, by reinforcing
compliance with the legislation in force relating to the defense o f competition and
second, by establishing price agreements with those sectors where i t i s possible to
observe market power. Additionally, an anti-cyclical fiscal fund will be established not
only to smooth eventual excess aggregate demand, but also to address punctual negative
shocks on our economy.
The second objective, that o f securing competitiveness, requires a continued
deployment of prudential policies to manage the favorable juncture experienced by the
external sector of the economy in a reasonable manner, to avoid short cycles o f
“excessive optimism” that could give rise to the accumulation o f economic and financial
imbalances that when corrected could lead to an abrupt interruption o f growth. To that

65

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines
end, in the first place, as a form o f anchor for the formation o f expectations o f medium
term revenues by economic agents, the current macroeconomic conditions o f strong fiscal
and external surplus are being preserved and private agents are receiving permanently the
signal that these surpluses will tend to be sustained through time. In the last 40 years, this
i s the first time that for three consecutive years there are twin surpluses both at the global
fiscal level and in the current account o f the balance o f payments. I t i s foreseen that both
surpluses will continue during the foreseeable future.
In fiscal terms, revenues have grown as a consequence o f the quicker pace o f
economic activity and o f a notable increase in the collection effectiveness (which in part
i s due to the adequate inter-temporal signals that are currently provided by the macro
environment). The sharp reduction in tax evasion allows fiscal policy to be more effective
in achieving macroeconomic objectives. Furthermore, the anti-cyclic fund will also imply
higher public savings.

At the monetary level, the policy o f reserves accumulation has allowed the
Central Bank o f Argentina to maintain today, even when taking into account the
cancellation o f the debt with the International Monetary Fund, a significant stock o f
foreign currency, that will continue growing in the coming years, so that our country i s in
a position to address any eventual downturns in the international environment. At the
same time, establishing the establishment o f mandatory reserves for capital inflows
makes i t possible to prevent waves o f excessive optimism becoming validated by an
unsustainable increase in foreign debt, which in turn may create doubts about the
sustainability o f i t s counterpart, the current account. A prudent policy regarding capital
inflows that stimulates the inflow o f medium and long term funds, reduces the risks o f
these being “pro-cyclical” and ensures a greater degree o f stability during sporadic
periods o f l o w confidence.
These preconditions, complemented with specific sectoral policies that are being
implemented by the Federal Government, give rise to a gradual but systematic recovery
of social indicators and will ensure a reduction o f the s t i l l high poverty indexes and a
substantial improvement in income distribution. In the current context o f growth based o n
stimulating external competitiveness, the withholding taxes o n exports play a central role
to ensure that the growth o f our external sales i s a process that takes place within a
framework o f social equity. In that sense, it i s reasonable, in general terms, for the
sectors that benefit the most from the change in relative prices to also contribute more to
the supply o f public goods by the National State. At the same time, the withholdings
operate to creating a wedge between the domestic and the international prices o f
commodities, that cushions the impact that the new profile o f prices could have o n the
basic consumption basket, which could otherwise impact negatively o n the real income o f
lower income families. On the other hand, the resources obtained from such taxes do and
will continue to contribute to the implementation o f social policies, infrastructure
investments and sectoral stimulation to help expand supply o f those activities o n which
the domestic and external demand has had an important impact.

66

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

Far from having been damaged by the export tax withholdings, the primary
productive sectors have benefited from the current scheme o f a competitive real exchange
rate, and have experienced remarkable growth that shows no signs o f being depleted. As
for their external performance, exports have shown a notable evolution in the last three
years during which their rate o f growth has increased.

Preserving an environment o f macroeconomic and financial stability and o f the
incentives to production, investment and employment that are provided by the current
economic policy framework, in a context o f ongoing reduction o f the debt burden, are
indispensable requirements to consolidate the sustained growth path exhibited by the
Argentine economy. The continuity o f growth and employment, the recovery o f salary
levels associated to productivity gains and to the specific situation o f profitability o f the
various sectors o f activity, together with adequate public policies, will make it possible to
achieve a sustained reduction o f poverty and indigence and to improve the distribution o f
income, after the profound deterioration experienced by all social indicators during the
last decade and the recent crisis. The resolution o f this crucial problem, through the
achievement o f continuous progress at the social level and the sustained improvement o f
well-being is the fundamental objective o f the National Government’s economic policy
and actions as a whole.

growth with the economy converging towards i t s long term growth rate, which for the

67

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

purpose o f the budget exercise i s assumed to be moderate. I t s slowdown with respect to
the levels observed for the last three years results from the gradual closing o f the large
output gap generated with the collapse o f convertibility. Thus i t i s expected that the
economy will gradually reach growth rates consistent with long term sustainability,
where investment will attain levels compatible with the required accumulation o f long
term capital stock and the real exchange rate will slowly tend towards its long term
equilibrium value, which will result in a gradual reduction o f the actual current account
surplus. A s a reference, the average real exchange rate in the last four decades has been
around 1.6 against a value o f 1 in December 2001, and the sustainability studies are based
o n medium term values for the real exchange rate o f approximately 10 percent above that
average. In order to realize this gradual convergence, i t will be important to avoid that a
pressure towards nominal appreciation o f the exchange rate generates expectations that
would reinforce a trend towards hrther appreciation, inducing a sudden loss of
competitiveness, or that an acceleration o f inflation produces a faster than required
convergence of the real exchange rate towards i t s long term equilibrium level. The
gradual convergence towards a more appreciated exchange rate and with l o w levels o f
inflation can be achieved starting from a strong fiscal position that, on the one hand,
makes i t possible to smooth the growth o f aggregate demand while, at the same time,
contributing to a sustained nominal parity through an additional demand for foreign
currency by the Treasury in case o f eventual excess supply in the foreign exchange
market.
The balance that has been achieved in the public accounts has created a margin for
monetary policy to accompany the process o f economic growth, responding to the
evolution o f the private demand for money. In order to assist in preventing a possible
rebound o f inflation expectations, starting in January 2005 the BCRA decided to
moderate gradually the monetary stimulus generated by the expansion o f the monetary
base, I t should be reiterated that the cumulative inflation o f the years 2004 and 2005
remained within the ranges projected in the respective budgets, and that said projections
took into account an adjustment o f the relative prices that had “lagged behind” since the
devaluation. In this respect, i t should be noted that the pass through o f the devaluation to
prices was, at the end o f the 36 months since the exchange rate adjustment,
approximately one half o f that observed in equivalent experiences in other emerging
countries.

As for the fiscal targets, i t should be noted that during the years 2003-2005 a
sustained surplus was generated in the public accounts, something unprecedented in the
last 50 years. This surplus was the result o f the sharp increase in fiscal revenues, while
expenditures have followed a more moderate path, initially driven by programs that were
required to address the social emergency and, more recently, to finance a public policy o f
infrastructure investment directed at sustained growth. This behavior will be maintained
during the next three years.
The provinces continue to operate in the framework o f L a w No. 25,917 o f the
Fiscal Responsibility Federal Regime, regulated by Decree No. 1731 o f December 7,
2004. I t is estimated they will end 2005 with a total surplus equivalent to around one
percent (1%) o f GDP. The budget projects a slightly higher surplus for 2006.

With the objective o f ensuring the greatest effectiveness for the current fiscal
policy, there are plans to modernize Financial Management tools by implementing a
results-oriented budget management, and strengthening both the Public Investment
System and the Public Debt Management System.
D.

Macroeconomic Policies and Reform Program to attain the Targets

In order to avoid repeating the boom and bust patterns that are characteristic o f
the past and achieve the targets set out above, it i s necessary to preserve the basic
macroeconomic balances, while stimulating the convergence o f the macro aggregates
towards proportions that ensure sustainable growth rates in a stable environment. As
opposed to what occurred in the past, the solid surpluses in the fiscal and external
accounts currently in place, the foreign exchange policy, and a well-balanced territorial
growth open up opportunities to achieve lasting economic growth.

One aspect that contributes to sustainability i s the growing share o f the tradable
sectors in the economy: while in 1998 the tradable sectors accounted for only 26 percent
of GDP at current prices, by the end o f 2004 these sectors represented more than 40
percent. A t the same time, total trade, exports and imports, more than doubled as a
percentage o f GDP, which implies that the recovery has taken place within the
framework o f an effectively open economy. All this should translate into stable growth
during the periods o f normality, and into an economy better prepared to deal with adverse
changes in the environment, avoiding profound crisis episodes with devastating social
and production consequences. Another element o f sustainability i s the equitable
69

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines
development of the country’s various regions. In that sense, although the new
macroeconomic environment has been extremely favorable for the recovery o f primary
production and the regional economies, the Government has pursued a series o f policies
to stimulate regiohal production.

The economic authorities consider that today i t i s essential to extend the reforms
carried out since 2002, through a social and political commitment to sustain the
transformations pursued, since, as already explained, these form a consistent and coherent
ensemble. In that sense, although there s t i l l remain important medium and long term
challenges related to the necessary process o f improving the institutions that govern
economic l i f e in Argentina, the reforms that have been implemented have made it
possible to realize a macroeconomic environment that i s suitable to address such
challenges.
Thus, more than a listing o f short term pending reforms, Argentina’s economy
today faces a series of policy challenges (detailed in the first part) different from those
that existed until now. In particular, the nature o f the problems that need to be addressed
by economic policy in the current circumstances requires a renewed “fine tuning” in the
management of policy instruments, that will confirm the current path o f the evolution of
Argentina’s economy.
The Argentine Government, however, is aware that a sustainable macroeconomic
context i s a necessary but not sufficient condition to attain a degree o f economic and
social development historically compatible with the aspirations o f Argentine society.
That i s the reason why, while continuing to implement social safety policies, measures
are being taken to improve the quality o f the labor factor o f production, in order to foster
greater social mobility. At the same time, a series o f policies have been developed to
extend and modernize the infrastructure, and stimulate private investment. In that sense,
and taking into account that the evolution o f investment (both in physical and human
capital terms) i s a priority o f the Federal Government, a series o f policies to strengthen
investment have been pursued, as detailed in the following section.
The Government’s Vision of the Role of the Private Sector in the Growth
E.
Strategy

The role that the current environment poses for the private sector, both domestic
and international, in the growth strategy is fundamental. For the private sector’s role to
be effective in pursuing the objective o f growth with equity, it i s necessary to ensure that
private investment flows are stable through time, that they provide the country with
access to new technologies, and that they open up the possibility o f taking advantage o f
financing opportunities in international markets in terms that are beneficial to the
country.
The recent restructuring o f the public debt and the efforts to strengthen the public
accounts have positive effects on the levels o f private profitability. As for the business
climate, the definition o f demanding but achievable fiscal and external commitments

70

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

provides certainty to the future path o f key macroeconomic variables (tax pressure) and
relative prices (exchange rate). Further, the reordering o f public finances and the
definition o f a sustainable fiscal scenario would induce-by
reducing volatility-a
greater projected profitability and a scenario o f more certainty for the private sector. O n
the financial front, the ongoing policies, by contributing to a progressive reduction o f the
public debt burden, produce a “crowding in” effect for the private sector, providing it
more space to access domestic and external financing. In turn, the lower needs o f
financing o f the public sector and the reduction o f the country-risk premium will make it
possible, other things being equal, to reduce the costs o f financing for private projects in
the international markets.
Table 4

had a higher interest rate than yield o n the reserves used for the payment.

Thus, by clarifying the prospects and eliminating a factor o f uncertainty, the
successful debt restructuring has had a positive impact on expectations, contributing to
reinforcing the fundamentals o f the current macroeconomic configuration, and improving
the prospects for sustainable, regionally balanced and socially inclusive growth.

71

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

This i s reflected in the behavior o f investment
since the exit from convertibility, which compares very
favorably with other national and international external
adjustment episodes. For example, while in the period
2003-2004, 52 percent o f the growth could be explained
by the behavior o f investment, in the two periods o f
sustained growth in the 1990's (1991-1992 and 19961997) the share o f investment was 39 percent and 37
percent, respectively. The increased investment
observed between 2003 and 2005 was led by the private
sector, especially by Small and Medium Enterprises,
and by the agro-industrial sector, with a strong impulse
in construction as well, both public and private. Table
5 shows the series Investment/GDP at current prices
since 1994 and including projections up to 2008.

Although the economic growth recorded since
the second half o f 2002, the enhanced certainty
resulting from macroeconomic policy, and the
favorable relative prices are the major factors that
explain this process, the Government o f Argentina
considers that this favorable environment needs to be
complemented with active policies with the aim o f
ensuring a sustained increase in investment as a share
o f GDP. In particular, use has been made o f fiscal
incentives and sectoral schemes that contribute to
stimulating private investment. Among the instruments
employed the following may be highlighted: (i)the
advanced reimbursement o f VAT on capital goods; (ii)
the accelerated depreciation o f investments; (iii)the
reimbursement o f the technical VAT upon making new investments; and (iv) a zero tariff
for the import o f capital goods (and a compensatory bond for local manufacturers). At
the same time, sectoral laws were passed to promote the software and auto parts
industries, while similar laws corresponding to the biotechnology and biofuels sectors are
currently in the legislative process.
Additionally, there have been initiatives for the development o f human capital and
approval o f the L a w o f Technicallabor training, including, inter alia, the following: (i)
legislative processing o f the draft for a L a w o f Education
Professional Education and (ii)
Financing, that will increase from 4% to 6% o f GDP the share o f education, science and
technology in the Federal and Provincial Budgets.
In the area o f public services, instruments relating to the legal frameworks have
been developed, including: (i)
the redefinition o f the Private Initiative Regime and (ii)
the
creation o f the Public-Private Partnership Regime. In parallel, an intensive work has been

72

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

going o n in connection with the renegotiation o f utility contracts. In that sense, as at
October 2005, out o f a universe o f 64 contracts being renegotiated, 15 had been
concluded and 49 were in the process o f being renegotiated. O f the latter, 51 percent had
signed agreements, 3 1 percent were in process and only the remaining 18 percent were
lagging behind. The information on the individual renegotiations, including the Final
Report o f the 25 Public Hearings that were held during 2005, is available at:
www.uniren.gov.ar.

F

Financing Requirements

The successful conclusion o f the restructuring o f the portion o f the public debt
that was in default, besides underpinning future expectations, enables the orderly
financing o f the fiscal accounts for medium term sustained growth, fundamentally
because the new commitments undertaken are strictly in line with the economy’s future
payment capacity, based on realistic forecasts regarding the historical development
capacity o f Argentina’s economy. At the same time, to give those bond holders who
accepted the debt exchange the opportunity o f sharing in the benefits o f economic
growth, the option o f GDP-linked payments was included. Although initially many
operators assigned a close to nil value to this option (in part as a consequence o f the
complexity o f calculating a precise estimate o f the price o f a contingent asset that i s
relatively new for the market), currently i t has a significantly positive value. I t should be
noted that all the exercises analyzing the sustainability o f the debt on which the Argentine
offer was based included the total debt that was originally in default. In other words, the
funds budgeted based on such exercises were calculated as if 100 percent o f the eligible
private creditors had accepted the offer, so that the percentage o f debt not exchanged i s
not considered a budget saving. In fact, the surplus funds budgeted are being used to
repurchase performing public debt. In line with the experience o f other debtors, at the
conclusion o f the restructuring process o f the defaulted debt, the Republic o f Argentina
informed the Paris Club o f i t s willingness to begin the negotiation o f said bilateral debt
immediately.
After the debt exchange there has been a substantial improvement in several o f the
usual indicators o f vulnerability and solvency, as shown in Table 6. All o f this implies
that the public debt service, although i t will demand sustained fiscal efforts during a very
extended period, should stop operating as a generator o f systemic vulnerability that
induced permanent uncertainty and inhibited the growth o f the economy in the medium
and long term.
The financing policy for 2006 i s based o n a primary surplus as well as on
extending the credit operations in the domestic market that began in 2005 in order to
meet the commitments payable during the period, fundamentally Bodens, Guaranteed
Loans and the newly restructured debt. Additionally, financing from the B C R A will
continue.

This repayment was part o f the

for the country’s decision making.

Regarding the multilateral credit agencies that have the objective o f long term
financing o f development, the premise i s one o f neutral flows o f nominal resources
(excluding interests).
Overall, the projections o f the multi-annual budget for 2006-2008 present a
primary surplus o f 3.3-3.5 percent o f GDP, which compared with interest payments o f
around 2 percent o f GDP, allow for an overall fiscal surplus o f 1.3-1.5 percent o f GDP
that will be used (as has been the case in recent years) to reduce the nominal debt stock.
From a longer term perspective, the total public debt, that before the restructuring
amounted to over 120 percent o f GDP, i s projected to decline to around 50 percent o f
GDP by the second half o f the next decade, under very moderate assumptions.
Certainly, despite ample primary and overall (after interest payments) surpluses,
Argentina s t i l l has financing needs to fund part o f the principal payments o f i t s debt.
However, our country has proved based on successive emissions o f new debt that, in spite
o f the dramatic crisis experienced between 1998 and 2002, credit markets have regained
confidence in the public sector. This sign o f confidence from the private sector i s a
demonstration o f the medium and long term credibility that economic agents accord to
the inter-temporal fiscal situation.
Since the current financial requirements are lower than the capital payments on
the public debt, the current macroeconomic policy implies a program o f net debt
reduction, consistent with the official strategy o f sustained growth. In this context,
financing by international agencies or other alternative sources available i s determined
more by public debt management policies (searching for better alternatives regarding
terms and interest rates, risk diversification, etc.) than by a need for financing due to
shortfalls in the domestic or international private markets.

74

Annex A
Economic Policy Guidelines

O f course, the IFIs financing i s also necessary to address specific projects that
contribute to increasing the productivity o f the public sector and the economy as a whole.
In that sense, financing investments with future returns i s within the so-called “golden
rule” o f public investment spending, according to which investments should be financed
with debt and not with current expenditures, so that each generation will contribute in
accordance with the benefits i t receives.

1.
On December 23, 2001 Argentina suspended
payment on some US$80 billion worth o f sovereign
bonds, making i t the largest sovereign debt default in
history. At end 2004, Argentina had some US$190
billion in sovereign debt, equaling nearly 126 percent
o f GDP (Table 1). O f this, some US$102 billionamounting to nearly 70 percent o f GDP-was in the
form o f bonds and past due interest slated for
restructuring. Argentina launched i t s formal debt
In June,
restructuring offer in January 2005.
following the conclusion o f pending legal action, the
Government announced that the debt exchange offer
was completed.
2.
The total amount o f bonds tendered in the
exchange was US$62.3 billion, implying an
acceptance rate o f 76.1 percent o f eligible principal in
default (Table 2). Tendered bonds were exchanged
for US$35.3 billion in new bonds, including US$15
billion in PAR bonds (which have no face-value “hair
cut” but include sharp reductions in interest rates and
35 years maturity), U S $ l 1.9 billion in Discount
Bonds (with significant face value hair cut but
relatively shorter in maturity and with higher interest
rates), and US$8.3 billion in Quasi-PAR bonds
(denominated in Argentine pesos and h l l y allocated
to domestic pension administrators). In addition, the
Government issued 62.3 billion units o f GDP-linked
warrants, corresponding to one unit for each dollar o f
new bonds issued, which promise positive interest
payments only in favorable states o f the economic
growth cycle, The operation resulted in a hair cut o f
about 75 percent in net present value terms, and
implied a reduction in the public debt from U S $ l 9 1.3
billion as o f end 2004 to US$149.8 billion as o f June
2005 (including debt restructuring holdouts for about
US$23.6 billion and excluding the GDP-linked
warrants) (Figure 1).
3.
Measured as a percentage o f GDP, public
debt declined from 126 percent as o f end 2004 to
about 85 percent using the 2005 GDP (about 73
percent excluding holdouts). In addition, the debt
exchange resulted in an improved debt profile.

in terms o f increasing the share o f debt in domestic
currency, which reduces the vulnerability to real
exchange rate swings (Table 4). Debt in domestic
currency increased from 24 percent to 37 percent
after the debt exchange. Finally, the exchange
reduced interest payments significantly, as a result o f
both lower interest rates on new bonds issued and
also interest capitalization for the first ten years on

On M a y 4, 2005 the Government issued
voluntary debt for the first time since the
default, with AR$1 billion o f 10-year maturity
bonds, promising an interest rate o f 2 percent
in excess o f inflation. Demand outstripped this
amount by more than 2-1 at an interest rate o f
6.51 percent plus inflation. Later in July the
Government issued an additional AR$2 billion
o f the same instrument. As in the first issue,
the auctions were oversubscribed, at interest
rates o f 5.51 and 5.2 percent plus inflation in
two consecutive auctions.
Beginning in June, major international credit
agencies upgraded Argentina’s sovereign credit
from default status, and sovereign spreads were

Debt Repayment to the IMF

O n December 15, 2005 Argentina announced

i t s intention to make an early repayment o f i t s entire

outstanding obligations to the IMF, amounting to
SDR 6.656 billion, about US$9.7 billion (Table 8).
The authorities explained the prepayment as a means
to achieve more independence in macroeconomic
management and the structural reform agenda. The
repayment was made using Central Bank reserves,
which declined to US$18 billion after the repayment.
To compensate the Central Bank, the Government
issued a bond denominated in U S dollars, which has
a 10-year bullet maturity and pays the same interest
rate obtained for international reserves. As a result,

The debt restructuring has significantly
improved debt sustainability prospects in the medium
term. Based on the macroeconomic framework
projected by the Government in the 2006 budget,
debt ratios would show a declining trend through the
CAS period, to about 66 percent o f GDP by end 2008
(Figure 4).
The underlying macroeconomic
assumptions o f the Government scenario are: (i)
GDP
growth rate declining gradually to 3.5 percent by
2007 and 2008; (ii)
a primary surplus o f the Federal
a real
Government o f 3.4 percent o f GDP; and (iii)
exchange rate appreciation o f 17 percent. However,
debt sustainability would remain subject to some
degree o f rollover risk. Projected rollover rates on
maturing bonds through 2007-2008 (the ratio o f bond
issuance required to cover the financing needs to
bond repayments) are o n the order o f 100 percent
(Figure 5).
9.
The IMF repayment operation had a positive
impact o n financing needs through 2006-8, as it
reduced total debt service by US$10.3 billion through
that period. The reason for this i s mainly the 10 year
maturity o f the bond issued by the Government to
compensate the Central Bank.

The possibility o f economic performance
remaining below the 2006 budget projection cannot
be discounted either. Lack o f reform could trigger a
vicious cycle o f deteriorating fiscal performance,
lower GDP growth, lower capital inflows and a more
depreciated real exchange rate, resulting in weaker
public sector creditworthiness and increased rollover
risks. For example, starting with the assumptions o f
the 2006 budget, if growth were projected to be 1
percent lower each year starting in 2006, the primary
surplus were projected to be 1 percent o f GDP lower,
and the real exchange rate were to show 10 percent
less o f an appreciation by 2008, debt ratios would
still decline but at a slower pace, remaining at about
76 percent o f GDP by end-2008, that is, only 10
percentage points lower than the 2005 estimate. The
rollover risks would increase significantly. Such a
scenario would require rollover rates o f about 150
percent through 2007-8.

Following the steps o f the Federal
Government, the provinces o f Mendoza and Buenos
Aires have restructured their provincial public debt in
default. The province of Mendoza restructured debt
in October 2004, for a total amount o f US$250
million in provincial bonds in default, which were
exchanged for an equivalent amount o f new bonds o f
additional 10 years o f maturity and about half the
interest rate. Definitive data on the outcome o f the
Mendoza exchange i s not available. Based on
preliminary data, the exchange conditions implied a
reduction in net present value (NPV) terms o f about
21 percent using 10 percent discount rates (Table 10).
Acceptance o f the offer was 64 percent. In December
2005 the province o f Buenos Aires completed the
exchange o f US$2.7 billion in provincial bonds in
default. The offer recognized past due interests for
US$0.4 billion, resulting in a total amount o f
recognized debt in default o f US$3.1 billion. The
offer consisted o f a menu o f three bonds, including
two Par bonds o f different maturities and interest
rates and discount bonds with a reduction in
principal. The estimated NPV reduction was an
estimated 48 percent, and participation was 94
percent.

In the last four years, the banking
sector has been able to overcome some
o f the effects o f the 2001-2002 crisis.
Deposits have maintained a growing
trend since the third quarter o f 2003
(Figure 1) and private sector credit
started to recover in the second h a l f o f
2004 (Figure 2). The quality o f bank
assets (Figure 3) and bank profitability
have improved, and new capital
increases are helping to improve
solvency. For i t s part, the Government
has eliminated withdrawal restrictions
imposed during the crisis and has, to
large
extent,
completed
the
compensation to the banks for policy
induced losses. Banking regulation and
supervision i s also returning to normal.
There are, however, some remaining
vulnerabilities such as the high exposure
o f the banks to the public sector, balance
sheet mismatches, and l o w capitalization
levels. Improving the efficiency o f
public banks, which remain burdened by
high operating costs and weak loan
portfolios, remains a challenge. The
biggest challenges for the future are to
increase long-term credit to the private
sector and improve access to financial
services to under-served groups o f the
population, including small and medium
enterprises, low-income households,
small farmers and microenterprises.

Prior to the crisis, the banking
system
exhibited
strengths
and
vulnerabilities. As o f 2000, Argentine
banks were well capitalized (with capital
adequacy ratios averaging 20 percent
during the 1993-2000 period) and liquid.
However, their profitability was low,
due to operational inefficiencies.

Argentina's social and economic
crisis o f 2001-2002 led, from early 2001
onwards, to capital flight and mounting
deposit outflows. The authorities'
response to the run on the banks further
reduced confidence in the system.
Restrictions on cash withdrawals o f
deposits (Corralito) were imposed in
December 2001, and the maturities o f
time deposits (Corraldn) were extended
in February 2002. Following the end o f
Convertibility in January 2002, the
balance sheets o f the banks were
dedollarized at asymmetric rates, and the
assets and liabilities o f the banks were
subjected to asymmetric indexation.

The policy measures generated
significant losses for the banks (Figures
4, 5). The asymmetric pesification,
which determined that banks had to pay
1.4 pesos per dollar o n dollar deposits
versus 1 peso per dollar on dollar loans,
generated losses to the banks that the
B C R A estimated (for compensation
purposes) at AR$29.6 billion. The
asymmetric
indexation, in which
deposits were indexed to the rate o f
consumer price inflation while certain
loans were indexed to wage inflation,
generated additional losses estimated at
AR$77 million. A number o f banks also
suffered losses as a result o f some
depositors being able to use judicial
rulings (amparos) to release frozen
deposits at the market exchange rate o f
over 3 pesos per dollar.

Figure 5. Banking system profltabllity after crisis

5.
To prevent a systemic collapse,
the Government took the decision to
compensate the banks for the policy
induced losses. In M a y 2002, the
Government decided to compensate the
banks for losses incurred due to the
asymmetric pesification, and in April
2003 the Central Bank (BCRA) allowed

for the amortization o f amparos over
five years. Rules governing the
compensation for asymmetric indexation
were issued in November 2003.

Regulatory forbearance was also
required to prevent a systemic collapse.
with
a
generalized
Confronted
insolvency problem in the banking
sector, the B C R A suspended capital
adequacy requirements and relaxed
regulations on loan classification and
provisioning to take into account the
effects o f the financial crisis. In addition,
the banks were allowed to operate during
2002 without presenting signed balance
sheets and financial projections. Lack o f
access to external financing (capital
markets and multilaterals) for bank
recapitalization required a gradualist
approach aimed at sustaining bank
profitability while
the
economic
recovery was not yet underway.
7.
Banks’ exposure to public debt
increased. Liquidity assistance by the
B C R A and compensation for policy
induced losses helped banks to recover,
notwithstanding their shortage o f capital.
This assistance, combined with a sharp
fall in private sector demand for credit,
increased banks’ exposure to public debt
to 50 percent o f total assets (Figure 6).
The l o w market value o f public debt
during the default increased the
uncertainty over the viability o f the
sector.

Figure 7. Private Sector Loans vs. Private Sector Deposits

8.
The crisis led to a drastic fall o f
lending to the private sector (Figure 6,
7). The stock o f credit declined 40
percent in real terms during 2002 alone
and a h r t h e r 12 percent in the first half
o f 2003. The reduction in lending was in
part the result o f a drop in the demand

for credit by the corporate sector, due to
lack of new investments, and to greater
reliance on internal sources o f financing
for the purchase o f current assets. Also,
f i r m s that were heavily indebted in
dollar loans from external sources were
seriously affected by the devaluation,
had repayment problems and were,
therefore, unable to borrow locally. O n
the other hand, the supply o f term
lending by the banks was limited by the
short t e r m nature o f their deposits and
their capital shortages.

The crisis changed the structure
and degree o f concentration o f the
banking system. As a result o f the crisis,
several foreign banks left the Argentine
market and others reduced their
operations in the country (Figures 8, 9).
Overall, foreign banks' market share o f
assets and deposits fell in 2000-2005,
while public banks increased their share
o f both (Figures 10, 11).
I n the last three years, the banks have
overcome many of the effects of the
crisis

Public and private sector deposits
have grown as confidence in the banking
sector increased. The outflow o f bank
deposits reversed in the second half o f
2002, allowing the BCRA to eliminate
withdrawal restrictions o f sight deposits
in December 2002. Total deposits
increased 70 percent in real terms
between December 2002 and December
2005, despite the negative interest rates
that they earn. One possible explanation
for this fast growth i s that depositors
may have expected a capital gain from

However, measured as a percentage o f
GDP, deposits are s t i l l below the pre
crisis level (Figure 12). Until the first
half o f 2004, public sector deposits led
the growth, but since then they have
slowed down, while private sector
deposits have continued to increase
(Figure 13). Deposits are still very short
term. More than 70 percent o f the
deposits are for less than 60 days, which
limits the capacity o f the banks to
provide long-term credit (Table 1).

Consumer and commercial credit
has recovered, but long-term credit
remains depressed. Consumer lending
has already exceeded i t s pre-crisis level,
due to the massive development o f credit
card lending (Figure 14). Mortgage and
corporate sector portfolios, instead, have
remained at approximately 74 and 72
percent o f their 1997 level. As a ratio to
GDP, private sector credit remains
below 10 percent compared to the 23
percent prior to the crisis.

Asset quality has improved
significantly with the recovery. The ratio
o f non performing loans (NPLs) to total
loans f e l l from 34 percent in December
2003 to 19 percent in December 2004,
and to 8 percent in December 2005.
Provisions now cover around 120
percent o f NPLs. B o t h private and state
owned banks have been successful in
improving the quality o f their assets.
13.
Banks have reduced significant
balance sheet mismatches (interest rates,
currency and term). The foreign
currency mismatch by end-2005, for
example, was 40 percent below i t s pre
crisis level in terms o f net worth.
Nevertheless, despite the growth o f

Annex C

indexed time deposits, there i s s t i l l a
mismatch in indexed instruments, which
implies a vulnerability to real interest
risk.

Operating costs have also been
reduced. The reduction in intermediation
has required a parallel reduction o f
operating costs, particularly among
private banks, which have reduced the
number o f branches and employees
(Figure 15).

09

15,
Banks'
profitability
has
improved and new capital increases are
helping to improve solvency (Figures 15,
16). The l o w cost o f deposits, the
decreasing level o f new loan loss
provisioning, and asset revaluations,
have all contributed to improved bank
profitability. In 2005, the banking
system net results amounted to AR$1.9
billion, compared to -AR$0.5 billion in
the same period o f 2004 and -AR$5.5
billion in 2003. Banks have made capital
increases o f almost AR$12.6 billion
since the crisis, o f which AR$2.3 billion
have been made in 2005. A significant
portion o f this capital increase has taken
place in foreign banks.
16.
Since
the
public
debt

value o f public bonds has increased,
benefiting the banks. The improvement
in public bond prices will alleviate the

In the last two years, mostly in

debt to the B C R A was AR$14 billion

Besides, the number o f entities indebted
declined from 24 to five. More than 80

Prudential regulations are being

2003 and has continued with only minor
delays with respect to the initial plan,
notably the extension from December
2004 to December 2005 o f the favorable
classification criteria for restructured
debt and for fixed assets required to ease
the transition to the new solvency ratios.
Both extensions are intended to avoid a
shortfall o f regulatory capital. The

Since March 2003, the B C R A has
allowed banks to discount the flow o f
funds for government exposure at an
increasing rate until 2007 and, starting in
June 2008, at the market discount rate.
The rules for booking the bonds received
from the debt exchange make the time it
would take for their book value to adjust
to market values dependent on the trends

The large gap between lending
23.
and borrowing interest rates may not be
a permanent feature o f the system. The
banking sector has benefited from high
interest rates on consumer lending
(which in nominal terms are above 25
percent) and low, even negative in real
terms, deposit rates (Figures 21, 22, 23).
This situation may change if banks
continue to reduce their high level o f
liquidity, which may lead to higher
deposit rates.

The tax on financial transactions
is impeding the banks’ recovery to their
central role in the administration o f the
payment
system.
The
financial
transaction tax lowers the demand for
payment services and reduces banks’
fee-based income. However, given i t s
importance in fiscal revenues, i t i s
unlikely that this tax will be eliminated
in the foreseeable future. The financial
system may b e able to increasingly avoid
this tax, as other countries have done,
through financial innovation in products
and services.

The major challenges for the financial
sector are to increase long-term credit
to the private sector and improve
access to financial services to
underserved groups of the population

25.
Restructuring o f the public banks
remains a challenge. W h i l e public banks
have strengthened their role as fiscal
conduits and increased their share o f
intermediation activity with the public
sector, they remain burdened by high
operating costs and weak loan portfolios.
What happens to these banks will have
an impact on the whole financial sector.
A key question will be whether the
future role o f these banks should be: (i)
commercial banks that compete with
private banks, (ii)agencies in charge o f
developing financial markets, or (iii)
some type o f hybrid. Whatever their
future role, they need to improve
solvency by further strengthening the
quality of their portfolios and further
reduce operating costs. The solution to
the problems o f public banks-due to
their size, governance, and balance sheet
composition- involves important fiscal
and political considerations. Public
banks’ compliance with the BCRA
solvency rules will require substantial
recapitalization plans over the next
decade.

91

26.
A major challenge i s to increase
the domestic supply o f long-term credit
to the private sector. Credit to the private
sector shrunk considerably as a result o f
the crisis, and has not yet recovered,
except for the strong increase in
consumer
lending.
Argentina’s
experience
coincides
with
the
international experience, which is that
following a deep financial crisis, GDP
tends to rebound surprisingly fast, while
investment and credit to the private
sector remain depressed for a longer
period o f time. While time i s needed for
long-term credit to recover, measures
need to be taken to reconstitute domestic
long-term funding and reduce the risks
o f long t e r m lending.
27.
There is a need to reconstitute
long-term funding in local currency.
Prior to the crisis, long term funding
came mostly from abroad in foreign
currencies (i.e. banks would issue
liabilities in international markets). This
generated distortions because much o f
this funding was used to give credit to
the non-tradable sector, thereby fuelling
mismatches that were at the heart o f the
cost o f the crisis. Long term peso
funding will, in the end, have to come
from pension funds (AFJPs) and annuity
providers (life insurance companies).
This requires the strengthening o f
healthy l i n k s between the banking and
non-banking sectors and improvement in
the investment and credit environment.

households and enterprises.

Trust
funds
(j?deicomisos
financieros) are new instruments linking
banks and long term investors. Trust
hnds are beginning to replace the banks
as main sources o f financing,
Institutional investors are the main
investors in the growing number o f
financial trust funds that are being
created in Argentina (Figure 24). The
trusts manage funds or securitize streams
o f income to finance a wide variety o f
public and private investments (they
account now for almost 10 percent o f
private sector loans). Although most
trusts are administered by banks, they
are not part of the bank’s assets, which
guarantees their protection from banks’
creditors. Other forms o f growing nonbank
intermediated financing
in
Argentina
include
financing
of
agricultural exports through international
and local suppliers.

29.
Recovery of long term lending
also requires reducing creditor risks.
Legal and regulatory changes to improve
contract enforcement and creditors’
rights are needed to reduce the risks o f
long term lending. In this context, it i s
important to recompose the contractual
integrity o f credit guarantees and the
credibility and reliability o f the
processes o f execution o f guarantees and
repossession o f collateral, which was
92

30.
A major challenge i s to broaden
access to financial services to the underserved. This i s a big challenge because
low income households, small farmers
and microenterprises have very little
access to financial services in Argentina.
In fact, Argentina lags behind other
countries in the region in the
development o f a self-sustaining
microfinance industry. Credit to small
and medium enterprises i s also a big
challenge. Legal and regulatory changes
are needed to regulate intermediaries
such as credit cooperatives, or new
instruments such as microcredit, to
extend credit to a large section o f the
population that cannot be reached by
commercial banks.

Recent surveys o f leading private
sector f i r m s confirm a generalized
perception
that
the
economic
environment for business has improved.
For instance, a survey o f leading
companies undertaken by Deloitte
(October 2005) states that 63.4 percent
o f those surveyed believe that the
economic environment has improved in
the past 12 months (Figure 1). This
trend reflects the improvements in macro
fundamentals exhibited in Argentina in
recent years.
Moreover, recent
developments in investment, private
consumption,
industrial production,
credits to the non-financial private sector
and the confidence index also illustrate a
general recovery trend after the crisis.

As shown in Figure 2, the investment

in the second h a l f o f 2005, a level above
the pre-crisis period. At the firm level,
55 percent o f the surveyed firms'

the past 12 months (31.6 percent

Private Sector Credit. Credit to

percent, still a record l o w (Figure 6).
The absolute level o f credit has
recovered since 2004, but s t i l l falls short
o f the demands o f sustainable strong
GDP growth. Long-term credit remains
scarce and i s available at reasonable
rates only for top tier companies. SMEs
do not appear to have needed significant
amounts o f credit as the shortening o f
terms o f payments following the crisis
and credit concerns, as well as taxes on
financial instruments, have reduced the
availability o f working capital financing.

Since the

effectiveness have remained at very l o w
levels in Argentina, as reported by
Kaufmann et a1 (Figure 14). Moreover,
as indicated in Figures 15 and 16,
compared to other middle income
countries Argentina i s distinctively
below par on both parameters. These
differences result in perceptions o f lower
standards o f infrastructure provision.
For instance, the recently released World

was: (i)suspension o f all public service
and infrastructure concession contracts;
(ii)devaluation o f tariffs; (iii)
a 180 day
freeze on tariffs (successive extensions
have meant that the vast majority o f tariffs
have remained frozen for more than 48
months); (iv) modification o f the existing
legal and regulatory regimes; (v)
elimination o f contractual indexation; and
(v) a call on the executive to renegotiate
all existing contracts.

Background

1.
The exit from the convertibility
regime in January 2002, the devaluation,
and the changes in the regulatory
severe
framework
contributed
to
contractual challenges to federal level
public
service
and
infrastructure
concessions.
Progress
toward
renegotiation o f the affected concessions
has been limited.

Of the original 64 contracts o f
2.
federal-level regulated public service and
infrastructure concessions that required
renegotiation, 28 have reached an
agreement’ with the Executive.
In
addition, the Government allowed 13 toll
roads to expire, partially cancelled one
railway contract, and cancelled 3 contracts
(postal service, communication and water
supply and sanitation), over which it has
since assumed ownership and control.
Four years after the freezing o f tariffs and
devaluation through emergency powers,
20 contracts still await a permanent
solution, including strategic concessions,
which include the largest gas and
electricity concessions (transport and
distribution).

4.

The Emergency Law established
a set of guiding principles for the
renegotiation of contracts: (i)
the impact
o f the tariffs on the competitiveness o f the
economy and on the distribution o f
income; (ii)
the quality o f the services and
investment plans; (iii)
the interest o f the
consumers; (iv) safety; and (v) the
profitability o f the companies.

5.
Following the crisis and during
the interim Duhalde administration,
efforts to advance the renegotiation
process under a modified legal
framework proved difficult. Attempts
by the authorities to provide temporary
relief through interim tariff adjustments to
the concessionaries by decree at the end o f
2002 and early 2003 were challenged in
court.

Regulatory Changes Affecting
Regulated Concessions

6.
The Kirchner administration,
which took office in M a y 2003, sought to
strengthen the legal basis for the
renegotiation process. Congress passed
law 25.790 o n October 1, 2003. The new
law extended the renegotiation timeframe
until December 31, 2004, and also
strengthened the legal powers for the
process. I t assigned joint responsibility for
the renegotiation to the ministries o f
federal planning and economy that would
have to be coordinated through the

Progress in advancing the
renegotiation of contracts

12.
The Government has signed
Letters o f Understanding’ with 286 out o f
a total o f 64 concessionaires included in
the decree (Tables 2, 3). This includes
the agreement reached with both telecom
companies. Fourteen have gone through
the
Congressional
review/approval
process (one approved by voting and the
rest on a no objection basis, or “sanction
j c t a ” , after 60 days in Congress), and
the rest are now under examination in
the joint Congressional committee for
the renegotiation o f contracts. The 28
agreements include eight (4 ports and 4
freight railways) which are permanent
agreements and do not include tariff
adjustments, but instead improve the
economic conditions o f the f i r m s
through adjustments in the investment
programs and by clarifying some other
contractual conditions’ The authorities
consider the 10 contracts agreed with the
electricity distribution and transport
companies and one contract agreed with
a gas distribution company as permanent
contracts, although the programmed
tariff agreements for 2006 have been put
on hold. Instead, these contracts have a
tariff
adjustment for 2005 (nons Agreement in this context refers to a Letter o f
Understanding signed between UNIREN and the
concessionaire, followed by a public audience as
required by Law. The Letter o f Understanding i s
followed by a signed Agreement between the
parties incorporating any required changes after
the public audience. The agreement in the case
o f the railroad ALL (2 concessions) s t i l l has n o t
gone through public audiences.
Thirteen road concessions reached their closing
date in October 2003 and Government rescinded
the postal service concession.
The 64 contracts exclude the contract for the
Bus Terminal in Retiro TEBA (No. 19 in Table
3). F o r example, in the case o f ports the contracts
establishes that the currency o f denomination o f
the rates will be the U S dollar.

residential users) and a commitment by
the Government to conduct an integral
tariff revision in 2005 with the aim o f
implementing the agreed adjustments in
2006. The four agreements for urban
access roads were interim through 2005
and require an additional negotiation to
be permanent. Finally, all the companies
where agreements have been reached
have had to agree to suspend their
litigation in the international arbitration
tribunals, and to withdraw their claim
once the integral tariff revision is
completed and has gone through the
public hearings.*
13.
Factors affecting long term
sustainability remain a main concern.
Several gas concessionaires have yet to
reach renegotiation agreements, and the
electricity concessions which were
renegotiated s t i l l await an integral tariff
review. The two major fixed line
telephone
companies
reached
agreements in principle that are n o w
subject to public audiences and
ratification by Congress. The contracts
for urban access roads require an integral
tariff revision and inter-urban road
concessions s t i l l require permanent
renegotiations. In the water sector, the
only federal level concession in the
metropolitan area o f Buenos Aires,
Aguas Argentinas, was rescinded by the
Government in March, 2006, after the
Government and concessionaire failed to
reach a renegotiated agreement. In the
latter case the Government has
established a new state company which
started operating the company after the
concession was rescinded.
8

I t i s unclear h o w the agreements will deal with
cases where the minority shareholders in the
company decide t o pursue the litigation in the
international arbitration tribunals. M o s t o f the
cases are in the ICSID, and 2 cases in
UNCITRAL (Paris).

’CMS gas Transmission (US) sold i t s shareholding

amount o f US$133 million, plus interest. The
interest calculated t o date brings the amount o f the

obligations to treat C M S fairly and equitably, under
the bilateral investment treaty between the United

15.
However, there has been some
limited progress in liberalizing nonregulated energy sector prices. The gas

production
companies
reached
an
agreement with the Government in March
2004 that allowed their prices to be
gradually brought back in line with the
international prices by December 2006.
These price adjustments for gas extraction
have also resulted in the need to increase
electricity generator prices (also a nonregulated sector, but one that saw i t s prices
frozen and converted to local currency).
The gas price increases only affect
industrial users and the electricity
generators. In turn, the electricity
generators have been allowed to increase
their sale price to the wholesale market
regulator
company
(CAMMESA).
Despite the wholesale electricity price
increase, C A M M E S A has not increased i t s
sale price to the electricity distribution
companies, as the tariffs for final
consumers have remained frozen. This

The main recommendations for

were included in a Board report."
World Bank Suggested Principles

The Draft Public Services Law

20.
Between 2002 and the beginning o f
this CAS period, the World Bank was
requested by the Government to provide
advice on the renegotiation process. Joint
IMF/IBRD missions identified and
suggested to the Government a set o f core
principles that emerged from key
stakeholders o f the renegotiation process,
as well as international experience. These
included:

16.
In August 2004 the Government
submitted a general framework law for the
regulation o f utilities and infrastructure.
T o date, the Draft Bill has not advanced
through the congressional process. The
period to discuss the draft legislation does
not expire until August 2006.
17.
The draft framework law will be
applicable to all public services, and will
modify all the existing sectoral regulatory
laws (such as gas and electricity). I t aims
at strengthening the role o f the Argentine
state as the titleholder o f public services,
assuming the responsibility and the
authority to regulate and control utilities
and other public services activities.

18.
The World Bank, European
Union, foreign governments and other
interested parties have made extensive
comments on the draft law. The general
consensus i s that the law could be
improved by striking a better balance
between consumer protection and the need
to ensure the continued participation o f the
private sector in the provision o f public
services, I n particular, the World Bank
indicated:

Maintain continuity o f affordable
services at prices and levels
commensurate with the current
social and economic environment;
Ensure transparent negotiation o f
consensual
adjustments

concession;
Consider
interests
of
all
stakeholders, including customers
and shareholders, the ability o f the

a lingering concern i s that if these

The status o f application o f these

2005 found in favor o f CMS Energy's

sewerage investments in areas where
concessionaires are operating will require
reaching a prior comprehensive and longt e r m agreement between the Government
and the concessionaire/operator, which
will enable the financial viability o f the
concession to be restored.
Assessment and Conclusions

25.
The Government has taken a
number o f steps to advance the
renegotiation process started in February
2002. In several cases, the agreements,
once ratified by Congress, will increase
the control by Government o f tariff
adjustment and investment plans. The
most pressing challenge will be to restore
long-term investment, the continued
absence o f which remains a concern.
26.
The wholesale energy price
increases during the past two years
represent a step towards the restoration
of normality in the upstream energy
sectors. However, they s t i l l fall short o f
addressing the existing deficit o f the
wholesale electricity stabilization fund
(CAMMESA) and do not enhance
sufficiently the revenue stream o f the 22
concessions responsible for energy
transport and distribution.

Annex F
Poverty and Social Development
Poverty, Inequality, and G r o w t h

1.
Argentina’s overall record in
reducing poverty and inequality in the last
three decades has been disappointing. The
country no longer ranks among those with
the lowest poverty and inequality rates in
the region. Poverty and inequality
increased largely as a result o f l o w average
growth and high volatility resulting in
several periods o f extended recession and
crisis, but also because o f changes in the
structure o f employment and wages that
have accompanied the growing integration
into the global economy. Although the
largest hikes in poverty have occurred
with the macroeconomic crises o f 1989
and 2002, poverty rates increased even
during the economic expansion o f the
1990s (Figure 1). According to estimations
for the national population, between 1992
and 2004, around 11 million persons
became poor: slightly less than h a l f in the
1990s (even during the growth episode)
and the rest during the 2001-02 crisis
alone.
The Gini index o f income
inequality increased from 0.45 to close to
0.53.

poverty and inequality evolution. The
200 1-2002 crisis significantly increased
poverty rates. In 2002, poverty increased
dramatically, to almost double the level o f
the late 1 9 9 0 ~and
~ in October 2002, 58
percent o f Argentines were living in
poverty (Figure 2). Also the Gini index
rose significantly during the crisis period
(Figure 3). The economic recovery has
brought an important reduction in poverty
and income inequality, although s t i l l
insufficient to return to the pre-crisis
levels. During the second h a l f o f 2005,
33.8 percent o f the population remained
below the poverty line and 12.2 percent
below the extreme poverty line.

Annex F
Poverty and Social Development
3.
The recent reduction in poverty i s
mainly a result o f the recovery and the
mitigation impact o f the Heads of
Household Program. During the recovery
period beginning in 2003, growth has
taken place chiefly in sectors which
employ relatively large shares o f less
skilled workers such as manufacturing,
retail services and construction. These
sectors employ relatively more semiskilled workers and registered the largest
j o b creation.
Moreover, the income
support provided by the Heads of
Household Program, which reached 2
million beneficiaries at its peak in 2003,
was well-targeted to the poor (Figure 4).
The program provided substantial income
support to those left most vulnerable by
the crisis,
particularly those that
experienced transient poverty (Figure 5).

However, the “easier” poverty
gains may have already been accrued, and
further progress in poverty reduction may
require tackling the more chronic
components o f poverty. The changes in
poverty rates during and after the crisis
have been particularly large because the
crisis brought the income levels o f many
Argentines near the poverty line (AR$233
per month or approximately US$SO in
early 2004). Consequently, even small
changes in mean income have a large
impact on the headcount poverty rate.
This partially explains the huge increase in
poverty during the crisis and the sharp fall
brought by the recovery. The most recent
figures show that the fraction below the
poverty line has continued to decline,

dropping to 33.8 percent in the second half

in poverty, and in particular in i t s
structural component, would require
accompanying growth with policies to
improve the assets and long-term income
generation potential o f the poorer families.

The long-term effects o f the crisis
are s t i l l uncertain. One promising s i g n i s
that unlike in some countries during
similar episodes, school enrollment rates
remained high during the crisis. While
infant mortality rates stagnated during the
crisis, they have since resumed their
downward trend, also suggesting that the
crisis's long term impact may be less
severe than expected.
However, as
discussed below, despite improvements
labor market indicators s t i l l show
weaknesses. In particular, rates o f informal
employment, long o n an upward trend,
leaped upwards during the crisis and
remain high.
The Labor Market

6.
The crisis brought a worsening o f
labor market conditions on three fronts,
and recent trends, while promising, are
s t i l l weak. At the onset o f the crisis,
unemployment rose further, the size o f the
informal sector continued to increase, and
wages fell sharply. Overall employment
and real wages have recovered since 2002,
but the labor market remains weak.
Recently, real wages in the formal private
sector have rebounded to pre-crisis levels,
but wages in the informal and public
sectors still remain about 25 percent below
those levels (Figure 6). The rebound in
the formal sector is encouraging.
However, many Argentines are now
employed in the informal sector, where
wages remain deeply depressed. I t i s
unclear whether the recovery in labor
market indicators will be sustainable.

7.
Unemployment has been closely
tied to GDP fluctuations, and unlike many
crisis episodes in the region, selfemployment was not the main cushion for
newly
unemployed
workers.
Unemployment reached its highest point in
the first half o f 2002, when more than 20
percent o f the active population was
unemployed. Unemployment f e l l rapidly
during the first part o f the recovery but at a
decelerating rate more recently (Figure 7).
Meanwhile, the fraction o f Argentine
workers who are self-employed, which
remained stable at roughly 20 percent for
two decades up through 2001, actually
declined slightly during the crisis.
8.
During the recent recovery,
informality rates declined slightly.
However, looking at the longer term,
informal salaried employment has been
increasing (Figure 8). In contrast to selfemployment, the size o f the salaried
informal sector (defined as those not
contributing to the social security system)
jumped during the crisis, reinforcing a
long upwards trend.
Nearly h a l f o f
salaried workers, who comprise threefourths o f total employment, are now
informal. While several factors m a y be
behind the increase in informality, their
relative importance remains unclear. The
possible causes include changes in labor
regulations, the burden o f business
regulations, increased tax evasion, and
structural change in the economy. Further
work i s needed to identify the relative
importance o f these causes and to design
appropriate policy responses. The broader
effects o f the crisis o n human capital and
the labor market overall also require
hrther study.

Health

9.
Argentina has stepped up efforts to
improve i t s health outcomes. Mainly as a
result o f the deep economic and social
crisis, they trail those o f countries with
similar levels o f development. In 2004,
life expectancy in Argentina at birth was
74.9 years, which, while greater than the
Latin American average, i s nearly 3.6
years below Costa Rica, 3.4 below Chile,
1.0 below Uruguay, and 0.3 below
Panama, countries with similar or lower
per capita incomes than Argentina.’

Flgure 9. Infant Mortality Rates
(per 1 OOO births)

10.
After the crisis, there was a
temporary increase in the rate o f infant
mortality, but in 2004 the favorable trend
that had been underway since the mid1990s returned, and mortality decreased to
14.4 (per 1,000 live births), which (Figure
9). However, the national average infant
mortality rate i s almost twice that o f Chile.
In addition, inequities in maternal- and
infant mortality between different regions
o f the country are significant, with rates up
to 25 (per 1,000 live births) in the North
West and North East regions.
The
government is making the challenge o f
reducing infant mortality with i t s Plan
Nacer. First evaluations show already a
positive result. The Bank i s supporting
government efforts through the MaternalChild Health Insurance project.

11.
The health system in Argentina
faces four key challenges present in the
system long before the latest (2001)
socioeconomic crisis, but significantly
aggravated by it: (i)the urgent need to
ensure access to basic health services for
the poor; (ii)the need to effectively

115

Annex F
Poverty and Social Development

address emerging and serious public health
challenges
(particularly
NonCommunicable Diseases, HlV/AIDS, and
others); (iii) the need to introduce
structural changes to improve the Federal
- Provincial relationship in the health
sector aimed at improving the incentive
framework for efficiency and equity in the
allocation o f public subsidies; and (iv) the
need to further improve and consolidate
the regulation o f Social Security in health,
and to improve the incentive framework
for efficiency and equity within the
system.
Education

12.
The Argentine education system
has been built on several strengths. I t has
ensured universal entry o f 5 and 6 year-old
children to
compulsory pre-school
education, with net enrolment rates higher
than 91 percent for both boys and girls.
This i s an enviable situation compared to
many other countries in the region and in
the developing world. However, national
indicators vary between provinces and
regions, and between schools within a
province, even if these share similar
socioeconomic conditions. At the same
time, the educational system has notable
weaknesses regarding the quality o f
student learning that are manifested most
readily in high dropout and repetition
rates, and low scores o f students on
standardized assessments. As a result, the
country exhibits some o f the lowest
returns to education in the region3
The education needs o f less

educated adults present an additional

116

full cycle o f lower and upper secondary
education, Argentina has a significant
number of unskilled adults entering the
labor market with limited ability to learn
new skills. Access to training i s not
equitable in Argentina, and related to
several factors: socioeconomic level,
educational level, enterprise size and the
level employment’s level o f formality. I t
is important to increase coordination
across different authorities responsible for
vocational education and training.
Social Protection

14.
The Social Protection system in
Argentina is, as in other countries in the
region, truncated, with programs aimed at
different groups o f the population
inadequately integrated and coordinated
among different institutions, resulting in
both overlapping and gaps in coverage.
15.
As a result o f the failure o f the
formal social protection system to prosper,
more recently Argentina has established
other ‘programs to provide protection to
informal workers (particularly as their
share in the labor market began to rise
during the last two decades) when
unemployment rates also began to rise
during the latter half o f the 1990’s and
more recently, in response to economic
and social emergencies. Currently, the
Heads of Household Program is the main
program reaching this group, but there are
also other smaller programs run by the
Central Government and by provinces and
municipalities. At the same time, on a
smaller-scale up to now, Argentina has
begun to implement a conditional income
transfer program oriented to promoting
investment by families in the human
capital o f children, similar to other
successful programs being carried out in
several countries in the region, including
Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. The plan

priority attention in so far as the lack o f
data has limited the capacity to formulate
sound public policies.
The lack o f
household survey data for rural areas
(approximately 13 percent o f the
population according to the Census)
prevents a full assessment o f rural life
conditions and rural poverty. However
recent studies conducted by the World
Bank in 2003 and census figures for 2001
indicate that rural poverty i s higher in
relative terms than urban poverty.
According to the national census 33 per
cent o f rural dwellers have at least one
unmet basic need, a figure almost twice as
high as the national average. This shows
the importance o f having disaggregated
data for policy purposes.

i s to scale-up this Program over the next
several years. In addition, in response to
the social and economic crisis in 2002, the
Government increased spending on
feeding programs.

Social Development Issues

16.
Argentina faces several challenges
in terms o f social inclusion since certain
segments o f society continue to have
unequal
development
opportunities.
Inequality and exclusion are both
hindrances to economic growth and longterm development.
Youth

17.
There i s growing awareness o f the
heightened
incidence
of
youth
unemployment and school drop-out.
According to the 2005 household survey,
more than half a million young people
aged 14-18 have dropped from school,
while 300,000 youth aged 14-24 neither
study nor work. About 27 percent o f
Argentine youth and adolescents (14-34
years old) are unemployed, and this figure
is 10 points higher, or nearly 40 percent,
for the 18-20 cohort. Seven out o f 10
young people with a j o b are in the
informal market. Around 1.2 million
young informal workers make US$lOO as
an average monthly salary. Options for
increasing investments in youth, whether
through labor policies, education, health,
or various remedial programs, are the
subject o f an ongoing World Bank ESW to
be completed in FY07.
Rural,
Indigenous,
Descendant Populations

and

19.
Similarly, research on indigenous
and afro-descendent populations i s sparse
because the permanent household survey
does not collect data on the issue o f
ethnicity.
The 2001 National Census
identified
24
indigenous
groups
comprising over 1,000 communities with a
total indigenous population estimated at 2
million. Using Census data and the unmet
needs
approach,
poverty
basic
vulnerability for indigenous groups i s
twice the rate for non-indigenous
populations (23.5 percent versus 13.8
percent). A World Bank sponsored pilotsurvey on the living conditions o f Afrodescendants found that they constitute a
vulnerable and marginalized group. Most
Afro-descendants live in urban slums and
have precarious jobs and lower levels o f
education compared to the rest o f the
population.

Afro

Gender Equality

18.
The expansion o f Argentina’s
regular household surveys (EPH-C) to
cover rural areas and collect ethnicity data
is a long standing issue that requires

20.
Argentina has made great progress
towards gender equality through the
strengthening o f women’s legal rights and
political participation as well as long-term
117

Annex F
Poverty and Social Development

commitments towards equal access to
education and health services. However,
some challenges remain in the areas o f
maternal
and reproductive health,
specifically access to contraception and
pre-natal care. Another set o f challenges
for gender equality arise from women’s
increasing participation in the labor market
as discussed below.4
21.
Women are increasingly entering
the labor market but face unequal
employment opportunities relative to men.
Female labor force participation has
increased in the last two decades as the
result o f long-term demographic and
education trends (currently 6 1.4 percent up
from 46 percent in 1992). Most new
participants in the labor force are primeage semi-skilled women.
Female
participation registered a sharper increase
after the crisis, perhaps reflecting a
household strategy to cope with real
income declines. The gender wage gap i s
not large, compared to other L A C
countries, and has been shrinking.
Women’s average wage was 87 percent
that o f men in 2003.
22.
However, there i s differential
access to employment by gender. Women
are more affected by unemployment. In
2004, the female unemployment rate was
16.8
percent
while
the
male
unemployment rate was 12.3 percent.
Women are also disproportionately
represented in the informal sector. Female
unemployment and informality may have
both short-term and long-term income
generation implications due to the lower
participation o f women in old-age security
schemes. Increasing female participation
in the labor force and employment
opportunities could be supported through
improved child care provision (both public
Source: CEDLAS (2,005) based on EPH.

118

and private) and training programs that
incorporate a gender dimension.
23.
Female-headed households register
rates o f poverty compared to male-headed
single parent households and other maleheaded households. However, poverty
profiles find that after controlling for key
characteristics such as education levels
and age, female-headed households are not
more likely to be poor compared to other
mono-parental households. Thus, the key
group for poverty targeting i s monoparental households, both female and male
headed.
Crime and Violence

24.
Youth unemployment and lower
educational
achievement
present
significant risks to society, including
increased crime and violence. Juvenile
delinquency increased 142 percent
between 1997 and 2001 in the Province o f
Buenos Aires.
Death by homicide,
accidents, and suicide are the leading
causes o f mortality for youth aged 20-24,
with males facing higher risks than
females (except for Buenos Aires and
Tierra del Fuego perhaps due to gender
based violence) (Centro de Informacidn y
Documentacidn, DINAJU). Two factors
contribute to this trend. First, educational
achievement has stagnated since the
1970s. Second, youth unemployment has
increased in the last decade (only 58
percent o f youth aged 20-24 are working,
This underscores the
Census data).

There i s also room for future scaling-up o f

prevention.
25.
Qualitative data and victimization

an important issue in Argentina (PAHO).
Data from DINAJU documents the
dimension o f this problem in Buenos Aires
and Tierra del Fuego (DINAJU). Besides
the negative impacts on women’s welfare,
this situation has implications on
children’s educational performance. Thus,
there i s need to up-scale efforts to address
this situation.

119

Annex G
Status Report on Millennium Development Goals
Background

1.
In 2005, at the 58th Annual
Conference o f the United Nations,
Argentina restated its commitment to
pursue the achievement o f the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).'
2.
This note summarizes the progress
achieved by Argentina and some o f the
prevailing challenges. In general the note
covers the evolution since 1990, but to the
extent data are available particular
attention is given to the years after the
2001-2002 crisis. Argentina has made
significant progress in reducing infant
mortality. Primary education and gender
equality goals have largely been met.
Areas in which progress has been less
strong include poverty reduction, maternal
mortality, H I V I A I D S and other diseases,
and access to water and sanitation in urban
and rural areas.

a. Reduce Extreme
Hunger by half

Poverty

and

Target: Cut in half from 1990 to 2015 the
fraction of the population in extreme
poverty

3.
Argentina's performance in terms
o f poverty reduction during the last 30
years has been disappointing. Even during
the economic expansion o f the 1990s
poverty rates increased. In 2003 the
increasing trend that had been observed
since the beginning o f the decade -with
very high values in 2001 and 2002- started
to reverse and poverty declined. This
improvement has helped Argentina
reestablish progress toward meeting the
MDG goal o f cutting extreme poverty by

'

Presidencia de la Nacidn (2005).

120

half by 2015. However, additional efforts
seem to be needed as poverty reduction
has decelerated during the most recent
period. Extreme poverty in major urban
areas using a US$1 poverty line decreased
from 7.9 percent in 2003 to 5.7 percent in
2004 and 4.7 percent in 2005. Using the
national poverty line, progress since the
crisis has also been substantial but
decreasing.
People living under the
poverty line decreased almost 30 percent,
from 54.7 percent in 2003 to 44.4 percent
in 2004 and 33.8 percent by end-2005.

A number o f factors have
4.
contributed to these diminishing poverty
rates. Among the most important, first,
has been the rising level o f employment,
particularly in economic sectors that
employ lower skilled workers from the
bottom quintiles. Second, the Heads of
Household income transfer program was
crucial early on in mitigating the effects o f
the crisis. Price stability may also have
been a significant factor, though rising
inflation over the past two years suggests
that this factor can not be counted on, and
may be one o f the reasons for the observed
deceleration in poverty reduction during
the last year.
b. Achieve
Education

Universal

Primary

Target: Ensure that all children complete
the cycle of basic education by 2015

5.
The country i s currently on track to
achieve the MDG goal in education.
Primary enrollment rates have been
consistently high during the last decades.
In urban areas, some 99 percent o f primary
school age children are enrolled. Similar
numbers are seen in rural areas as well, but
repetition rates are significantly higher,
constraining progress toward the access to

Annex G
Status Report on Millennium Development Goals

higher education levels. As a result, the
Government will implement a targeted
program to address the particular needs o f
rural areas.
6.
Regarding secondary education,
gaps in coverage remain. In urban areas,
15 percent o f secondary school age
children do not attend school. Comparable
data for rural areas are not available, but
other sources o f information indicate that
the percentage o f young people not
attending school in rural areas i s even
higher .

7.
In view o f the specific difficulties
faced by the education system, the
Bicentenary Goals, drawn form the M D G s
and the Dakar Goals o f Education for All
(EFA), consist o f ten simple but strategic
education goals that the country has
proposed to meet by 20 10.
c. Promote Gender
Empower Women

Equality

and

Target: Ensure gender equality in access
to all levels of education by 2015

8.
The indicators for this goal include
equality in education, greater economic
participation and civic participation o f
women. Argentina has already achieved
the target for equality in access to
education, The ratio o f girls’ to boys’
literacy rates is at 100 percent and net
enrollment rates by gender suggest that the
target has been met at all levels o f
education. In fact coverage i s higher for
girls and young women than for boys and
young men, especially in secondary and
tertiary education. This fact highlights the
persistence o f high dropout rates among
boys.

121

9.
However there i s more space for
improvement when considering the other
dimensions o f gender equality. Gender
gaps in the labor market continue to be
present. Both the labor force participation
and the rate o f employment are nearly 30
points higher for men than for women. In
addition, men generally work under better
labor conditions. Different informality
indicators show that the percentage o f
informal workers is lower for men than for
women.
In fact, the percentages o f
working women having social security
coverage have been fairly constant during
the last two years while that o f men have
slightly improved.
10.
In terms o f labor income, the
gender gap is continuously present over
the years and there i s no clear s i g n o f
change. On average, the monthly labor
income o f male workers i s about 40
percent higher. However, this difference
could be entirely explained by work hours
(men work 10 to 11 hours more than
women) since there i s only a slight
difference between the hourly wage o f
men and women.
d. Reduce Child Mortality
Target: Reduce by two-thirds (between
1990 to 2015) the under 5 mortality rate.

11.
The indicators for this goal include
infant mortality and under 5 child
mortality.
Both indicators showed
moderate decreasing trends over the
199Os, reaching rates of 16.3 and 18.9
respectively in 2001. These favorable
trends were interrupted by the recent
crisis. In 2002 the infant mortality and the
under 5 child mortality rate rose to 16.8
and 19.5 respectively. But between 2003
and
2004
both
rates
improved
significantly, decreasing by more than 2

Annex G
Status Report on Millennium Development Goals

points. Figures for the first half o f 2005
indicate that mortality rates continued to
decline during the course o f last year. The
reduction took place in all provinces, and
even more remarkably in the provinces
facing the most critical social conditions,
which helped reduce inequality. As a
result, Argentina i s again on i t s way to
reaching the MDG child mortality goals
by 2015.

e. Improve Maternal Health
Target:
Reduce
by three-quarters
from1990 to 2015 the maternal mortality
rate

12.
This progress came as a result o f
Argentina’s efforts to mitigate the effects
o f the economic crisis by implementing a
series o f emergency interventions. Some
o f these interventions were particularly
oriented to increase the access to basic
health care o f the uninsured, especially
mothers and children, through the
implementation o f Plan Nacer.
This
program, together with the decision to
protect priority health expenditures,
tackled many factors affecting infant
mortality-such
as underweight births,
malnutrition, lack o f clean water, and
deficient immunizations-thus
leading to
a beneficial impact on mortality rates.
13.
As an intermediate step toward the
MDG goal, the Plan Federal de Salud,
created in 2004, aims at reducing the
infant mortality rate by 25 percent
between 2002 and 2007. As a result o f the
recent progress, more than 50 percent o f
that target has already been completed. In
addition, the Plan sets out to tackle
provincial inequality by reducing the Gini
coefficient o f the provincial mortality by
10 percent between 1990 and 2015.

122

14.
Reducing maternal mortality by 75
percent between 1990 and 2015 i s s t i l l a
challenging
goal
for
Argentina,
particularly in light o f the irregular
improvement achieved during the last
years. In 2000 the maternal mortality rate
had decreased more than 30 percent since
the beginning o f the decade; however
towards 2002 the previous progress was
substantially reverse an increase o f more
than 30 percent. During the last two years,
the maternal mortality rate decreased from
46 per 100,000 live births in 2002 to 40 in
2004. Even though this improvement i s a
positive sign, Argentina would need to
strengthen i t s efforts in order to approach
this target. Preventive programs and
regulation policies can make a great
contribution since the majority o f maternal
deaths are due to preventable causes.
15.
Health authorities have committed
to an intermediate target o f reducing
maternal mortality by 20 percent between
2002 and 2007.
Additionally, since
mortality
rates
are
extremely
heterogeneous among provinces, they have
also agreed o n reducing provincial
inequality as a priority goal to be pursued
through specific interventions in the
poorest provinces.

Annex G
Status Report on Millennium Development Goals
f. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and
other diseases
Target: Have halted by 2015-and begun
to reverse-the spread of HZV/AIDS

16.
Since malaria i s less o f a problem
in Argentina, especially in urban areas, the
country has identified Tuberculosis and
Chagas’, diseases to combat by 2015
along with HIVIAIDS. According to
recent data, improvements in these areas
have been very modest, and Argentina
would need significant efforts to meet the
MDG goals.

The prevalence o f tuberculosis has
17.
been declining due to successhl
intervention programs. In 2003 there were
about 55 people with tuberculosis over
100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, mortality
reductions have stagnated and no further
improvement has occurred since 2000.
The same applies to the rates o f detection
and treatment o f cases, which declined
significantly during the 1990s but have
remained constant during recent years.
18.
Improvements in the prevalence of
Chagas
have been
geographically
heterogeneous. Actually, in 2004 only 26
percent o f the endemic provinces had
certified the interruption o f the risk of
infection. This shows a meager advance
in comparison to the beginning o f the
decade.

The incidence o f HIV/AIDS has
19.
been falling in recent years, the same as
the mortality rate although at a slower
pace. From 2002 to 2004 incidence
decreased by 10 percent while mortality

* Infection caused by a parasite, which kills some

50,000 people each year worldwide, though i s most
prevalent in Latin America.

123

only decreased h a l f as much. In 2004, the
incidence and mortality rates were 42 and
38 cases per million persons, respectively.
I t i s also worth noting the changes in terms
o f the population affected by HIV/AIDS.
Particularly relevant is the recent spread o f
the disease among heterosexuals, mainly
women, showing how the pattern o f
contagion has shifted. This fact has been
addressed by the public campaigns
through targeted preventive actions for
vulnerable groups.
g. Ensure Environmental Sustainability
Target: Reduce by half the proportion
of population without access to safe
drinking water or sanitation

20.
The overall level o f access to clean
water in Argentina i s 94 percent.
According to urban data for 2003, the
percentage o f people without access to
water i s about 1.6 percent, very close to
the target of 1.5 percent. In rural areas the
situation i s less favorable, but there i s little
new data since 2001. Census data for
2001 indicate that approximately 22
percent of the total population had no
access to safe drinking water (public
network or pumped water), which i s a
noted improvement from 34 percent in
1990.
21.
Access to sanitation services
appears to be more restricted, but the
analysis i s limited due to lack o f data.
About 40 percent o f the urban population
has no access to secure sanitation services.
When rural areas are also taken into
account, the percentage rises to 58 percent.
Consequently, more efforts are needed to
meet the MDG goal.

Proposed Operations Program

1.
As with the 2004 CAS, the Bank
will continue to seek to engage in active
dialogue with the authorities. Where there
i s policy consensus the Bank will proceed
to lending operations. Areas o f agreement
with the Government under the old CAS
have yielded substantial investments in
transport, chiefly roads, health, income
transfer programs, and public sector
strengthening. Where agreement on
lending is pending but dialogue i s
potentially productive, the Bank will seek
to maintain engagement, including through
analytical work, with the possibility o f
developing investment operations in the
future,
In those key areas where
engagement remains undeveloped, such as
macroeconomic policy and the financial
sector, or would benefit from expansion,
such as poverty, the Bank will seek to
develop analytical products that could
open the way for new or broader dialogue,
while continuing to monitor progress.
AAA Program

2. The Bank has recently conducted
important analytical work in an area
crucial to Argentina’s development that
has helped to provide the framework for
Bank support to Argentina as i t seeks to
move beyond crisis recovery to
sustainable, widely shared economic
growth. The report, entitled Argentina:
Seeking Sustained Growth and Social
Equity,
Observations
on
Growth,
Inequality and Poverty, was prepared in
coordination with government authorities,
academics and others in Argentina with
insight into the persistent problems o f slow
growth, volatility, poverty and inequality,
and options to developing policy direction
for the future.
3.
Looking forward, the Bank plans to
undertake a number o f analytical and

126

advisory activities that can build on
previous work, fill knowledge gaps and
ensure the Bank meets i t s core fiduciary
and corporate responsibilities. Perhaps the
most important o f these studies will be a
Programmatic Poverty analysis.
This
study i s expected to span the full time
frame o f the CAS and cover the three CAS
pillars. I t will involve a three phase
analysis o f the determinants and
consequences o f poverty.
The three
phases would encompass: (i)
informality
rural poverty
and labor market issues, (ii)
and (iii)
urban issues, including access to
water.
Analytic work that would
specifically support the first pillar o f
sustained growth with equity emphasizes
work on infrastructure, including a study
o f Logistics and Transport Sector
Competitiveness and an Energy Review; an
Infrastructure Finance study is planned to
help strengthen the dialogue on
infrastructure development and financial
sector intermediation in support o f growth.
These studies will be complemented by a
broader Private Sector Development report
on the investment climate, and an in-depth
analysis o f the Fiscal Space for Public
Investment.
This latter study will
capitalize on the fiscal monitoring work
underway at the provincial level under the
recently approved projects supporting
provincial level investments in roads,
water, flood prevention and institutional
strengthening.

the dialogue on health and improve the
dialogue on education would be supported
by an Impact Analysis of Reform in
Education and Health Sectors planned for
later in the C A S period.

I.Sustained Growth with Equity

5.
The third pillar on improved
governance will benefit from the ongoing
Institutional Governance Review, which i s
looking at the experience o f public sector
reform in Argentina at both the federal and
provincial level. Work is planned to help
support strengthening o f economic
management at the provincial level under a
series o f Provincial Economic Memoranda
(PEM) which would combine analysis o f
growth and poverty issues with a review o f
public expenditures in selected provinces
or regions). The work under the PEMs
would be accompanied by the national
scope o f the fiscal analysis under the study
o f Fiscal Space for Public Investment. To
complement this work and continue to
strengthenthe financial integrity o f its own
operations, the Bank i s planning studies to
meet Bank core fiduciary and corporate
responsibilities, Le., the proposed CFAAs,
CPARs and ROSC.

6.
Finally, the CAS plans work on
the environment and natural resources
management,
with
a
Country
Environmental Analysis and dissemination
o f the just-concluded study called
“Argentina
Agriculture
and
Rural
Development: Key Issues”.
Both are
under-pinning the design o f the next phase
o f lending in these sectors.

127

8.
Private sector investments in
infrastructure figured prominently during
discussions o f the CAS program with the
Government.
There i s interest in
supporting private sector development
through improved financial intermediation
and an enhanced business climate. The
need for the public sector to step more
prominently into supporting broad-based
rural development and managing the
environment was widely supported.
9.
Focus areas of support.
The
Bank’s proposed program to support the
CAS pillar o f more sustainable and
equitably shared growth in Argentina
would focus on the following four areas.
The bulk o f lending under the CAS is for
infrastructure development with an
emphasis on: (i)
expanding assets for the
poor and improving mobility, and (ii)
continuing to develop the nation’s
transport system to lower logistic costs and
facilitate regional expansion o f trade and
commerce.
Investments
for
rural
development and the environment
would focus o n promoting agricultural
growth, reducing rural poverty and
improving environmental managementall o f which stand out as critical and
relatively unaddressed concerns.
The
growth pillar o f the CAS also features
important initiatives to maintain and
broaden dialogue on macroeconomic

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

policies and strengthening the financial
sector and investment climate.
Infrastructure Development

10.
M u c h o f the lending under the
C A S i s to support the Government’s
efforts to rebuild key infrastructure
capacity. Investment in key assets to
support growth has been declining for
some time now. Average total investment
in infrastructure during the 1990s
remained w e l l under 2 percent o f GDP,
placing Argentina at the lower end among
Latin American countries and far below
countries such as Chile and Colombia
(which invested upwards o f 4 percent per
year in infrastructure over the last decade)
and China (6 to 7 percent).
11.
L o w levels o f investment explain
why Argentina has significantly fewer
assets in infrastructure than would be
expected given its level o f income and its
socio-economic characteristics. Following
the crisis o f 2001, resource flows for
investment dried up. This has resulted in
the emergence o f a number o f bottlenecks
in infrastructure as the economy continues
to recover. In particular, growth has been
fueled by a surge in agricultural exports
that i s straining the country’s transport
infrastructure. Electricity generation, gas
production and transport are likely to be
insufficient within the next few years to
meet expected increases in demand. At
the same time, the nearly 34 percent o f the
population that remains under the poverty
line has limited access to infrastructure
services, and many poor households face
difficulties in paying utility bills even at
frozen tariffs.
12.
Infrastructure investments continue
to be o f crucial importance for Argentina
to achieve i t s objectives o f growth and
poverty reduction.
Private sector
128

investment in infrastructure has yet to
recover from the crisis, and a greater share
o f the infrastructure stock i s now in public
hands, which will require investment funds
and
adequate
management
tools.
Improved partnerships between private
and public sectors will be essential to
ensure (i)the medium and long term
viability and continuity o f the public
services and infrastructure concessions,
and (ii)the resumption and significant
increase o f investments in both public and
private infrastructure to support mediumterm growth.
13.
The CAS centers around three
areas o f intervention in infrastructure:
0

0

0

Expanding assets for the poor and
improving mobility.
Expanding and maintaining the
nation’s transport system to lower
logistic costs and facilitate regional
expansion o f trade and commerce.
Developing
strategic
freight
investments to expand production
frontiers
and
tap
regional
opportunities,

14.
Expanding assets for the poor
and improving mobility. K e y areas in
this context include water, sanitation,
urban flood prevention, urban transport,
municipal level infrastructure,
and
renewable rural energy.
15.
Water supply and sanitation (WSS)
figures prominently in the proposed
operational program, as do the issues o f
water resource management,
flood
management and urban drainage. In WSS,
the Bank will continue to support strategic
investments in the province o f Buenos
Aires under the proposed Buenos Aires
Province
Sustainable
Infrastructure
Development project (BA SIDP APL2).

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

The first phase o f this operation has
supported government efforts to improve
the provision o f infrastructure services in
Buenos Aires province within a
framework o f fiscal responsibility to help
return the province and the country to
sustainable growth, poverty alleviation and
social equity. The project seeks to help
the provincial authorities implement their
strategy to expand water, and especially
sewage, coverage by subsidizing access to
approximately one-half million l o w
income people living in areas o f high
sanitary or environmental vulnerability.
The CAS seeks to complement these
efforts in WSS in other provinces under
the envisaged Basic Municipal Services 2
project.

16.
Flooding i s a major natural hazard
for Argentina which poses serious
challenges to development.
Flooding
continues to exact a heavy toll and
dangerous
conditions
occur
with
alarmingly high frequency. The Bank has
provided important support to respond to
this problem in the City o f Buenos Aires
with the Urban Flood Prevention and
Drainage (APLl), and would continue to
do so under the planned APL2 which aims
to expand Bank assistance to other eligible
provinces at risk. The project seeks to
increase the country’s resilience to floods
through protection o f critical urban
infrastructure, and to introduce a risk
management approach to investments o f
provincial and municipal governments.
K e y goals are to increase population
awareness and preparedness for the threat
o f floods as evidenced by improvements in
flood protection levels, a reduction in the
population living in areas at risk o f
flooding, and a reduction in damage to
properties by storms. Discussions have
been held with the Government with
respect to expanding the construction o f

129

low-cost, self-help housing in flood prone
areas generally inhabited by the poor.
Broader river-basin wide planning and
investments would be provided under the
envisaged Integrated Water Resources
Managementproject APL 1 (see below).
17.
To address mobility concerns o f
the poor in urban areas, the Bank is
planning investment support for public
transport through a proposed Urban Public
Transport project, which would follow the
on-going Buenos Aires Urban Transport
project with key interventions to address
the mobility o f the poor and transport
safety issues. These projects could be
complemented by GEF initiatives to
support improved urban air quality, such
as the recently approved concepts for
GEF-financing in Rosario, Cbrdoba,
Posadas, San Miguel de Tucumhn, and L a
Plata.
At the provincial level, the
authorities have requested support for the
feasibility study o f a mass transit system
between Avellaneda and L a Plata
following
successful
(Transsur) ,
experiences elsewhere.

18.
Expanding and maintaining the
nation’s transport system to lower
logistic costs and facilitate regional
expansion of trade and commerce. In
the road transport sector the Bank i s
playing a key role to develop nation-wide,
and in some cases provincial-wide, support
to develop sustainable road management
programs including the implementation of
performance-based contracts for the
rehabilitation and maintenance o f key
assets within a budget resource constraint.
The Bank proposes to support the
Government with a variety o f initiatives.
The CAS includes the second phase o f the
National Highway Asset Management
project
(APL2)
which
supports
implementation o f a national road

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

management strategy through multi-year
performance based contracts (CREMA)
focused on rehabilitation and maintenance
for the priority national road networks
(non-concessioned). The success o f this
project would be measured by the
percentage o f paved non-concessioned
roads under the C R E M A system,
implementation o f a bridge management
system, and the National Directorate o f
Highways having effectively developed
actions under the Institutional Renewal
Action Plan. Other roads projects include
the second phase of the BA SIDP APL
which supports key investments in
provincial roads, and a follow-up
Provincial Road Infrastructure project 3,
which would continue support for scaling
up improvements and management o f
priority provincial road networks, in part
through expanded implementation o f
performance-based contracts.
These
projects would complement the planned
investment lending operations designed to
replace the remaining tranches o f the old
provincial reform loans ( P U S ) in the
provinces o f Cordoba, Santa Fe and
Catamarca.
The provincial investment
loans for Cordoba and Santa Fe are
expected to be mostly in support o f
provincial road infrastructure, while the
Catamarca project would emphasis water
supply (see below).
These provincial
investment loans are also expected to
support selected institutional strengthening
initiatives as has been the case in the BA
SIDP APL.

19.
Going beyond the exiting road
network, the Bank has a strong role in
helping to develop strategic transport
and freight investments to expand
production frontiers and tap regional
opportunities. To address competitiveness
and logistics issues, the Government has
requested support for strategic freight

130

investments that can expand the frontier o f
agricultural production and tap into
potential integration with neighboring
economies. Possible areas o f support
include: (i)a project to finance l o w
altitude tunnels between Chile and
Argentina, and (ii)a project to upgrade
and develop a logistics hub around the port
o f Rosario with railroad and road l i n k s to
facilitate the increasingly large volume o f
agricultural exports carried by rail. The
proposed program includes a Freight
Corridor Infrastructure project and the
Rosario Port Logistics Hub project. These
strategic freight investments would
complement the initiatives on national and
provincial roads supported by the
Government and the Bank.
Rural

and

the

20.
Argentina's growth has long been,
and will continue to be, based in
significant part o n i t s tremendous natural
comparative advantages. These include
extensive productive land for agriculture,
forestry and livestock; mineral resources; a
long coast-line and waters for fisheries;
and natural beauty throughout providing a
strong base for tourism. Over half o f total
export earnings and export growth since
2001 has come from the combination o f
primary and processed goods o f the
agricultural sector.
Nevertheless, the
country's deepest pockets of poverty are
found in the rural sector, particularly in the
northeast and northwest regions, including
the indigenous populations in those areas.
Given the specific characteristics o f rural
Argentina, the Bank's strategy focuses o n
promoting agricultural growth, reducing
rural
poverty,
and
improving
environmental management.

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

regional agricultural trade and animal
health issues. This work in being done in
close coordination with the Bank-wide
avian flu initiative, and enjoys strong
support from the FAO.

2 1.
Promoting rural development
and reducing rural poverty. The CAS
includes support to expanded rural
infrastructure (particularly irrigation and
market access), improved technical
services to producers (particularly control
o f crop and animal diseases), and
increased access to export markets through
improved product innovation, quality and
marketing. In this context, supplemental
financing to the Provincial Agricultural
Development Loan (PROSAP l),would be
part o f a regional effort to combat footand-mouth disease. Pursuit o f the broader
rural growth agenda would be provided
under PROSAP 2. The CAS also includes
a proposed Rural Poverty and Growth
operation that would build on the Bank's
support for the Government's dual efforts
to promote growth oriented rural
infrastructure while also supporting small
farmers and the rural poor.

24.
Improving
environmental
management. Argentina also faces an
environmental challenge due, in part, to
the challenges brought on by recurrent
economic crises.
Critical pollution
management issues are driven by the high
level and increasing urbanization o f the
country.
Municipal solid waste has
become a concern in some city areas.
Water quality i s worsening (both surface
and groundwater), especially due to urban
sanitation problems and certain industrial
"hot-spots". Air quality i s deteriorating in
major urban areas. The tourism industry,
while a welcome source o f revenue for the
country, may be increasing pressure on the
natural resources. The CAS supports the
Government's effort to re-launch the
environmental agenda in Argentina. The
country's environmental management
builds on sound policies-including recent
"framework" legislation designed to
simplify previous laws-but
there are
challenges with respect to implementation.
Turning sound principles into improved
environmental outcomes will require a
national strategy, as well as political and
popular support.
In addition to
strengthening monitoring and enforcement
functions, both national and provincial
governments are increasingly interested in
more clearly incorporating environmental
cost-benefit
analysis
into
sectoral
policymaking.

22.
The CAS also includes a proposed
Rural Poverty and Growth operation that
would complement the above efforts to
promote
growth
oriented
rural
infrastructure while also supporting small
farmers and the rural poor. It would
include targeted CDD-type financing to
rural communities, including in indigenous
areas, and the strengthening o f service
delivery across the many agencies active
in rural areas. Another area o f lending i s
support to small and medium farmer
investments in forestry, to be blended with
GEF financing (see below). An area o f
non-lending support would be TA to
strengthen the national statistical system to
regularly collect and analyze primary data
on rural households.

A final focus area will be an IDF
in support o f the Consejo Agropecuario
del Sur (the Mercosur Council o f
Agricultural Ministers) to better manage
23.

131

25.
An Environmental Management
APL i s planned that would provide
strategic support to Argentina's brown
(pollution), green (natural resources), and
land use agendas. The first phase would

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

build on the Solid Waste Management
project (approved in February 2006). I t
would also promote progress in pollution
control in industrial areas (including the
Matanza-Riachuelo hot-spot in Buenos
Aires), hazardous waste, urban air
pollution, and cleaner production. The
APL would also consolidate three ongoing
projects in a new component for
Sustainable Forestry Management, with
the dual objectives o f reducing native
forest cutting and increasing plantation
forestry investment and exports.
The
second APL phase would implement new
strategies for land resources management,
land use planning, marine and coastal
resources, and tourism development-all
o f which are important for economic
growth, trade, and j o b creation.
The
proposed APL would build on the Country
Environmental Assessment, and will
incorporate the use o f GEF and carbon
finance resources to the full extent
possible.
26.
Another key element o f the
proposed natural resources management
strategy i s (as mentioned above) an
envisaged Integrated Water Resources
Management project which would aim to
support basin-wide planning, institutional
reforms, and investments designed to
improve water resources management,
reduce sectoral and provincial conflicts,
reduce downstream flooding, and reduce
land and water degradation. This project
would build on the experience o f the
Catamarca Provincial Investment project
which i s expected to focus o n upgrades to
water supply, irrigation, and water
resources management in the province.
Separately, a Mining Decontamination
project would encapsulate low-grade
radio-active waste at closed uranium
mines and processing plants in several
provinces--an environmental priority in the

132

affected cities and towns in Mendoza,
Cbrdoba, and Salta.
Other Areas of Support for Sustained
Growth with Equity

27.
Strengthening the
financial
sector. As requested by the Argentine
authorities, the Bank will continue to
the
provide
assistance
towards
strengthening o f the country's anti-money
laundering (AML) and combating terrorist
financing (CFT) apparatus. Based on
preliminary
discussions
with
the
authorities, the objective o f the assistance
is to address deficiencies identified in the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
assessment mission as well as by
GAFISUD, the FATF-AMWCFT group
for South America. In addition to the TA
program that has been currently
implemented in cooperation with the IMF
to reinforce Central Bank's AML/CFT
supervisory capacity, the Bank will
provide support in several areas to help
Argentina build a robust AML/CFT
system. In particular, assistance may be
provided, via in-country workshops
addressed to the Banking Industry,
including, but not limited to, banks,
cooperativas de crkdito, casus de cambio
to raise the level o f understanding o f the
relevant A M L / C F T international standards
and best practices.
Promoting and
strengthening
AML/CFT
preventive
measures within the financial industry will
contribute to reinforce the financial sector
and improve investment climate.
The
Bank will also continue to provide support
to build technical capacity and prevent
banks and other financial institutions from
being abused by criminals.
28.
Enhancing
the
business
environment and
private
sector
development.
The main activities

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

identified to support an enhanced business
environment and further PSD are related to
the implementation o f the Economic
Recovery Support Adjustment Loan
ERSAL and the proposed Innovation
project. The thrust o f the ERSAL i s to
accompany key measures o f the
Government in the area o f small and
medium enterprises, regulation and
financial sector. The loan, which was
approved by the Board in 2004, i s not yet
signed. The Innovation project would be
developed as a multi-sector effort that
would address competitiveness issues,
particularly with respect to SMEs, as well
as key education issues. The Innovation
project could also support institutional
strengthening to improve public policies to
promote innovation in Argentina. The
project would be complemented by
analytical and advisory activities including
the planned study on Private Sector
Development and a possible Innovation
study.

the crisis-excluded

30.
Focus areas of support.
The
Bank’s proposed program under the social
inclusion pillar would focus on selected
areas. The social inclusion pillar also aims
to deepen the dialogue on poverty through
programmatic analytical work, as well as
continued poverty monitoring including
possible support for survey work on rural
poverty. The focus areas are:

11. Social Inclusion

29.
Human and social development
form the focus o f the second pillar o f the
Country Assistance Strategy. Successhl
development requires efficient and
equitable institutions that implement social
and economic policy, as well as more
direct programs to foster social inclusion.
At the same time, improvements in the
performance of the social sectors have
important linkages to support broad-based
growth, governance and social advance.
The social inclusion challenges in
Argentina are daunting with poverty s t i l l
afflicting nearly 34 percent o f the
population; key health and learning
outcomes in many parts o f the country
lagging behind; and segments o f the
population-already
marginalized before

provincial level.
Raising school completion rates

31.
Progress in this area will involve
supporting (i)the transition from the
emergency income support programs
(implemented during the crisis) to foster
employment and (ii) increasing j o b
opportunities for today’s poor in the labor
force. While many current income support
program beneficiaries would be integrated
into wage- or self-, employment, structural
poverty will remain. The Bank would
seek to support the Government in
establishing more permanent safety nets
for this population group.

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

32.
Transitioning out of emergency
income
programs
and
fostering
employment. The next couple o f years
will likely see a major social policy shift in
Argentina, as announced by Government,
to emphasize employment promotion
policies. This will involve designing proemployment public policies both for
beneficiaries o f the current income support
programs, especially the large Heads o f
Household (Jefes y Jefas de Hogar) social
assistance program, as well as for lowskilled workers in today’s labor force.
During the CAS period, the Bank would
support this emphasis through a number o f
activities, including the Heads of
Household Transition project, presented to
the Board in March 2006 under the
previous CAS. This project i s designed to
link income-support to beneficiaries
participating in tailor-made training and
education courses as well as j o b interviews
and active employment search supported
by municipal employment officers. To
complement this, the Bank will work with
the Ministries o f Labor and Education in
the design o f a new national Lifelong
Learning project which would aim to
develop flexible learning opportunities for
the unemployed and poor workers to
acquire labor-market relevant skills (today,
10 million Argentine workers do not have
a secondary school degree) in which the
core competencies would be developed in
close
coordination
with
industry.
Underlying both lending operations is
analytical work which the Bank is carrying
out together with the Government (see
above),
33.
The
key
benchmark
for
transitioning out o f the emergency
program, for which the Bank has been
providing both lending and non-lending
assistance to the Government, would be
that the number o f beneficiaries

134

participating in emergency workfare
programs i s reduced from 1.4 million (end
2005) to less than 0.5 million by the end o f
the CAS period. Additionally, the Bank
will work with the Government towards
the definition and implementation o f an
integrated, inter-ministerial strategy for
lifelong learning and skill building.
34.
Establishing more permanent
safety nets and direct support to
vulnerable groups. While many o f the
current beneficiaries o f income support
programs will be able to reintegrate
themselves into the workplace, a more
permanent safety net will be needed for
the structurally poor in Argentina. Such a
safety net would not only cover today’s
beneficiaries
of
social
assistance
programs, but ideally would also reach out
to the large number o f extreme poor that
currently do not have access to this
support. Through technical assistance, the
Bank has started to accompany the
Government’s
efforts
to
reassign
beneficiaries from the Heads o f Household
workfare program to the Familias
conditional cash transfer program. Policy
options to broaden the safety net base,
possibly by expanding the child benefit
from the formal social security to informal
sector workers or assigning a role to noncontributory pension or unemployment
benefits, are analyzed in the Old Age
Welfare and Social Security study. Policy
action would be supported by the
envisaged Income Support for the Poor
project. As these reforms are in their early
stages, the Bank’s goal during the C A S
period i s to contribute to the successhl
phasing out o f the emergency workfare
program and the transition to a new
income transfer scheme, as well as the
definition o f the role o f non-contributory
benefits in Argentina’s longer-run social
policy.

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

35.
The CAS would also continue
support to the Government to promote
direct,
demand-driven
community
programs.
Excluded regions and
communities contain a large proportion o f
the country’s extreme poor who tend to be
located in dispersed rural areas in the
Northeastern and Northwestern regionsan estimated 1.2 million (based on 2003
survey data)-and
have been to some
extent “invisible.” The average income in
some rural areas i s only 10 percent o f the
level in urban areas, and two thirds o f the
rural population i s below the poverty line.
Finding ways to tap into Argentina’s rural
resource base in a sustainable manner i s
fundamental to both economic growth and
poverty alleviation. In this context, the
proposed Rural Poverty and Growth
project would approach rural issues in a
comprehensive framework, promoting
farm and non-farm activities and their
interconnectedness
to
enhance
productivity in both areas.
Direct
community support to reach the poorest
regions would also constitute the basis o f
the
proposed
Early
Childhood
Development and Community Services
project, which would build on the
experience the Bank has accumulated with
demand-driven community and social fund
projects in Argentina over the past ten
years.
Improving
Outcomes

Health

and

Education

36.
I n the health sector, considerable
progress has been made since the 2001
crisis to instill greater coordination
between the Federal Government and the
provinces.
Indeed, reforming the
provincial health system and i t s
relationship to the Federal Government i s
the key priority for ensuring access to

135

basic health services to the poor while at
the same time introducing important
structural changes in the incentive
framework for the provincial health
systems.
37.
The center pillar o f the health
strategy is implementation o f the
Provincial Maternal and Child Health
Insurance program (Plan Nacer), which
the Bank i s currently supporting through
the Maternal-Child Health Insurance APL.
The Government has launched Plan Nacer
in the nine poorest provinces o f Argentina.
The second phase o f the Maternal-Child
Health Insurance APL will assist the
Government to scale-up the Plan Nacer to
the nationwide level. As the Bank i s
comprehensively supporting Argentina’s
flagship maternal-child health program o f
Argentina, the CAS sets a goal o f reducing
the infant mortality rate from 14.4 per
thousand live births in 2005 to 12.0 per
thousand by 2009, along with expanding
coverage of the maternal-child health
insurance from 30 percent (2005) to 50
(2009) o f the eligible population in the
nine northern provinces.
Closely
complementary, new lending for Essential
Health Services i s proposed that would
replicate the incentive and governance
structures introduced under the Plan Nacer
in public health functions at the provincial
level. This includes service delivery for
key public health programs such as
vaccination, as well as implementation o f
provincial
health
prevention
and
promotion activities for HIV/AIDS,
infectious diseases, and health monitoring.
38.
In
the
education
sector,
improving school completion and leaming
outcomes for children from disadvantaged
families remains an important challenge.
Problems regarding student learning arise
from multiple causes, some o f which, such

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

as the socio-economic conditions o f
households, are outside the immediate
ambit o f the education system. However,
problems in educational policymaking also
play an important part. The Bank has
worked with the Govemment to address
some o f the key issues facing education,
and the C A S seeks to continue this
assistance.

39.
The Government has identified
education as a major priority in achieving
i t s goals o f poverty reduction and job
creation, and has proposed a significant
increase
in
funding
to
ensure
improvements are made through the
Education Finance Law. The law has been
passed by Congress and has important
implications for the level and equity o f
education finance (at the national and
provincial levels) as well as for the
governance mechanisms in which the
In
national and provinces interact.
December 2005, the Board approved a
Rural Education Project, which i s
complementing
the
National
Government’s strategic orientation in (i)
establishing
results-based
contracts
between the national and provincial levels;
and (ii)linking funding, at least partially,
to the completion o f such results. As
above, the Bank supports the overall
national Rural Education Program so that
the goal will be to measure success during
this CAS period based on overall rural
education results. K e y targets include (a)
an increase in the number o f children o f 5
years o f age in rural areas accessing preschool, from 80 percent in 2005 to 90
percent in 2009; and (b) an increase in the
completion rate for classes 7-9 in rural
areas from 68 percent in 2005 to 80
percent by 2009.
40.
Given the significant funding needs
at the provincial level to meet financing

136

targets as well as learning outcomes, the
CAS plans for a Provincial Preschool and
Basic Education project which would
finance results-oriented preschool and
basic education investments in poor areas
o f one (or potentially two) provinces with
the largest education needs. The project
would likely include the province o f
Buenos Aires which accounts for 40
percent o f school enrollment in Argentina
today. Work in both sectors would be
supported by the planned study on the
Impact of Sector Reform in Health and
Education.
An Expanded Dialogue on Poverty

41.
In response to the expressed
interest o f the Government, the Bank is
following up the 2005 study on growth
with equity with a Programmatic Poverty
Study on Informality, Poverty, and
Inequality.
This poverty assessment
involves a longer-term, three-phase
programmatic approach based on close
collaboration with government agencies.
Currently, the first phase o f the work i s
being developed in collaboration with the
Ministry o f Labor and the National
Institute o f Statistics (INDEC). I t involves
an in-depth study o f trends o f informal
employment, characteristics o f informal
f i r m s and workers, and the determinants o f
informality and i t welfare implications.
Under the first phase, an initial desk study,
to be completed by mid-2006, will be

The second phase o f the programmatic

including access to basic services such as

and
dissemination events.

Strengthening Public Sector Institutions

111. Governance

42.
The
Kirchner
administration
recognizes that strong public sector
management, and governance more
broadly, is vital to sustain growth, enhance
competitiveness and promote equity.
Analysis by external organizations such as
Transparency International, work by WBI,
and surveys o f Argentine citizens and
opinion leaders all make clear that
Argentina faces important challenges
across a range o f areas in order to improve
governance.
The Government, in
“Argentina 21: Argentina Facing the 2Ist
Centuvy ”, has committed to strengthening
performance with the objectives o f
improving coherence and efficiency with
the highly federal system o f government,
increasing effectiveness o f basic service
delivery, and enhancing transparency and
trust in the public sector.

43.
Focus areas of support. The CAS
seeks to support the twin objectives o f
improving the effectiveness o f basic
service delivery, and building transparency
and trust, primarily through building on
the notable progress achieved in Bank
support for institutional strengthening at
both the national and sub-national levels.
New
investments
in
institutional
strengthening would be complemented by
analytical work on provincial and federal
fiscal space, as well as fiduciary AAA
such as CFAAs and CPARs. Initial steps
to establish a dialogue through ongoing
AAA could also lead to support for
strengthening the judiciary to help
improve the accessibility, impartiality and

44.
Strengthening
federal
institutions. The CAS will continue to
deepen the Bank’s contribution to the
Government’s efforts to strengthen and
make more transparent and accountable
the
country’s
public
institutions,
particularly with respect to those agencies
responsible for basic social services, such
as, for example, the national social
security system (ANSES). The ANSES 2
project i s building on achievements o f the
first ANSES operation. I t aims to enhance
the service delivery o f ANSES by
improving i t s efficiency, effectiveness,
transparency and accountability through
institutional reengineering, fraud and error
detection, change management and greater
internal and external oversight. Expected
outcomes include an increase in user
satisfaction o f ANSES as measured by
service-delivery outcomes and by citizen
satisfaction surveys.

45.
The CAS includes support for the
second phase o f the project to strengthen
the National Social and Fiscal Data
Identification System (SINTyS) under the
SINTyS APL2. The SINTyS project i s
generating substantial fiscal savings
through improved targeting o f government
program beneficiaries, including the Heads
o f Household program. The second phase
o f the APL project would build on SINTyS
APLl,
which
identified important
weaknesses in Argentina’s capacity to
generate, store and exchange basic data on
the beneficiaries and providers o f the
country’s social service programs. The
SINTyS APL2 would focus o n the

137

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

institutional, legal, and technological
infrastructure needed to consolidate the
system. With some three-quarters o f all
public expenditures by federal and
provincial governments in Argentina
directed to social services, addressing
these weaknesses will be fundamental to
consolidating overall fiscal stability and
improving confidence public institutions.

46.
The CAS envisages continued
support for state modernization at the
federal level under a second State
Modernization project. This project would
build on the results and shortcomings o f
the existing project. In particular, it would
aim to have a strong strategic focus and
robust implementation framework for
the
Federal Government’s
support
modernization efforts.
47.
A key component o f the strategy
for institutional strengthening which
encompasses both the federal and
provincial levels i s the proposed
Governance 21 project. The project aims
the
efficiency,
at
strengthening
effectiveness and transparency o f public
expenditure
management,
and
at
strengthening management capacity to
improve coordination between the public
and private sector for economic
development. Among the results to be
achieved, the project aims to support: (i)
expansion o f the integrated financial
management (SLU/web- SIDIF) system to
a broader range o f federal level public
institutions and (ii)
expansion o f the public
investment management system (BAPIN
11) to additional provinces.
48.
Supporting
public
sector
modernization at the provincial level.
The proposed lending in support o f
improved governance includes a planned
Second Subnational Public
Sector

138

Modernization project which would follow
up on the first project approved in
December 2005. These projects aim to
improve the institutional capabilities o f
provincial governments to manage
resources and implement sound fiscal
policies, while also improving the quality
o f service delivery to citizens and creating
better conditions for accountability and
transparency.
Measurable outcome
indicators include increased use o f
integrated payroll information systems and
improvements
in
provincial
tax
administration.
The Bank’s work on
provincial
institutional
strengthening
would be deepened through support
provided under direct investment loans to
selected provinces which would support
public management objectives tailored to
the conditions and priorities o f each
province. In this context, new direct
provincial investment loans under the CAS
would complement the institution-building
support being provided under the Bank’s
existing investment projects operating at
the provincial level, either directly or
through Federal Government on-lending.
Where relevant they would also build on
progress achieved under the earlier
provincial reform loans (PFUs).

49.
Strengthening the judiciary.
Lack o f confidence in the efficiency and
transparency o f the judiciary i s a chronic
problem for Argentina, with substantial
implications for i t s economic growth and
long t e r m social development. Since the
early 2000s, the legal community, various
NGOs, and judges and other public sector
professionals have renewed demands for
reform, focusing on the enactment o f the
earlier legal changes and additional
activities to increase efficiency and
broaden access. Progress at the federal
level has been uneven. At the subnational
level, real improvements also vary, but

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

several provincial judiciaries, including
those supported by the Bank's previous
Provincial Development 11 project, have
reduced delays, expanded services, and
adopted their own Alternative Dispute
Resolution programs. Other provinces
have shown interest in similar support, and
at the federal level, there i s also a new
potential. The Bank has taken initial steps
to establish a dialogue through ongoing
AAA that could lead to support for
strengthening the judiciary, to help
improve the accessibility, impartiality and
effectiveness o f the justice system. There
i s a potential for Bank support at the
federal and subnational levels, especially
with respect to service improvement, as
well in support o f programs to combat
judicial corruption and improve selection
processes and career development.

50.
Statistical capacity building i s
essential for getting relevant and highquality information in the hands o f
policymakers in a timely manner. Data
availability i s one o f the necessary
conditions for making good policy
decisions. This i s particularly important in
a large country like Argentina which i s
seeking to improve the effectiveness and
transparency o f public sector management.
5 1.
Argentina's
adherence
to
international standards in official statistics
has improved steadily, as evidenced for
example by participation in the IMF's
Standard Data Dissemination Standards
(SDDS), thereby improving the quality
and transparency o f the data being
collected and disseminated. This i s
especially so for the macroeconomic,
monetary, fiscal, and real sector statistics.
Improvement in the quality and
availability o f the poverty and social sector
statistics, albeit steady, has been slower
and more piecemeal.
Past efforts to

139

improve poverty and social data with the
national statistical office ( N E C ) and
social ministries has brought about
positive changes, such as improved
warehousing, analysis and dissemination
o f the data, collection o f information on
the profiles o f beneficiaries o f targeted
programs, and better data accessibility at
the unit record level.

52.
There i s nevertheless room for
improvement in the scope and quality o f
the statistical data.
For instance,
Argentina does not have a household
survey program with a universal coverage
o f the population. Therefore, data on the
effects o f the recent agricultural
commodity price boom on the welfare o f
the rural population by region i s scarce.
The lack o f survey data in rural areas
limits the comprehensiveness o f the
picture o f poverty in the country. There
are also urgent needs for establishing and
harmonizing the measurement framework
in the collection,
processing and
dissemination o f social sector statistics as
they relate to monitoring Argentina's
progress in achieving the MDGs and other
social objectives.
53.
In this sense, INDEC's expressed
interest in receiving Bank support,
possibly through the statistical capacity
building (STATCAP)
program,
to
strengthen the statistical system i s
welcome. This could constitute an integral
part o f the Bank program under the
improved governance pillar o f the CAS.
Civil Society Engagement

54.
After close and ongoing dialogue
with civil society throughout the country,
the Bank i s focusing its outreach efforts
with civil society on the two themes o f
Youth and Transparency. These subjects
have emerged as central to the Bank's

Annex H
Proposed Operations Program

interlocutors over recent years, including
in the CAS consultations for the 2004 as
well as the 2006 CAS. The Bank’s work
on youth builds on extensive experience in
supporting civil society organizations
working with young people in Argentina
and throughout the other countries o f the
Southern Cone (Chile, Paraguay and
Uruguay). The most important o f these
past initiatives were the Development
Marketplace in 2005 and the Small Grants
Program 2004. Currently an ESW on
Youth in Argentina i s being undertaken
and a Social Accountability study is
envisaged later in the CAS period. The
challenge going forward is to find new
ways to support and interact with young
Argentines to think together on the key
issues, especially employment-a
major
concern for Argentina’s young people.
Ongoing and proposed projects aim at a
closer interaction with youth and at
providing venues where youth can express
their views.

55.
The other key issue that emerged in
the Bank’s outreach to civil society i s
transparency and governance. The Bank
will seek to build on i t s partnership with
civil society in this area through varied
approaches. One is through the Small
“Promoting
Grants
Program,
Transparency ”, which will support
activities that empower citizens to take
initiatives to enhance and influence
development outcomes.
This year’s
initiative seeks to identify innovative
projects o f civil society organizations,
promoting transparency
and social
accountability. Another key initiative will
be to involve the participation o f civil
society in the implementation o f the
Bank’s Fiduciary Action Plan.
How
governments secure and spend Bank
financing has been a major interest o f civil
society groups and a consistent theme o f

140

past consultations.
Bank staff have
initiated discussions with a key NGO,
Poder Ciudadano, to utilize the model
pactos de transparencia in World Bank
financed procurement. The Bank will
assist in informing civil society with
regard to N G O monitoring o f the
transparency o f bidding under Bank
financed projects.

Annex I
Argentina Client Research

1.
To
better
understand
the
environment in Argentina and how the
World Bank i s perceived by i t s main
interlocutors and other stakeholders and
opinion-makers, the Bank commissioned
two research tools to be carried out prior to
preparation of the CAS.
The first
instrument was the standard survey which
has been used by the Bank in more than 50
client countries. Some 280 representatives
o f federal and sub-national government,
parliamentarians, the private sector, civil
society and the press responded to the
written survey questions. The second
research tool, carried out by an Argentine
polling firm, was a more qualitative
analysis and featured in-depth interviews
with 82 leading opinion makers from
politics, business and the media.

however, that the interviews that formed
the basis o f the qualitative survey reveal
that for many respondents, particularly
those with limited direct experience
working with the Bank, the extent and
accuracy o f their knowledge o f the Bank
varied.

2.
Although the majority o f the data
described below comes from the client
survey, the insight provided by the
qualitative analysis supplements, and in
most cases strongly confirms, the data
yielded by the client survey. The research
reveals information on the Bank’s overall
image in the country as well as on how the
respondents
viewed
Argentina’s
development priorities, and the role and
effectiveness o f the Bank’s support with
respect to those priorities.
Key Findings

3.
Respondents knew the Bank fairly
well, with the average familiarity rating
for all categories o f respondents at more
than 7 out o f 10 (ten being “extremely
familiar with the Bank”). Parliamentarians
were the most familiar at 9.5 and civil
society the least, at 6.2. Some 65 percent
o f respondents had three or more years
experience working with the Bank, while
an additional 20 percent had between one
and three years. I t should be noted,

141

4.
One notable finding o f the client
survey is how respondents think their
country i s doing four years after the crisis.
Nearly three quarters said that Argentina i s
“currently headed in the right direction”.
I t is important to note that those from
government were substantially more
optimistic than those from the private
sector and civil society. Nevertheless, a
majority o f all stakeholder groups
responded that conditions in Argentina are
improving. As would be expected after
three years o f fast growth, respondents
identified economic recovery as the area
where Argentina i s doing the best.
Reducing corruption was said to be the
area doing the least well.
5.
In terms o f sustaining the
impressive growth performance since the
crisis, the two leading priorities identified
by all respondent groups in the main
survey were access to education and
adequate infrastructure. Expanding the
question to “development challenges”
more broadly, 44 percent of respondents
chose employment creation as the most
important or second most important
priority. Following poverty reduction and
education again, issues o f governance
dominated the remainder o f selections,
with improving law and justice systems,
the business climate and government
effectiveness all around 20 percent.
Role o f the Bank Group

6.
The message for the Bank i s
mixed. On the positive side, the client

Annex I
Argentina Client Research

survey reveals that more than 80 percent
o f respondents believe that the Bank
should maintain or increase i t s level o f
involvement in Argentina. In a country in
which the Bank i s perceived to have a
substantial presence, and in which the
nature o f that presence has often been
associated with a policy approach that
prevailed during the 1990s that i s now
widely rejected, this i s significant. The
interview component o f the research made
clear that the Bank in 2005 i s competing
with an image o f i t s perceived role as part
o f the now much derided “Washington
Consensus” o f a decade ago.

7.
There i s also a fairly good
alignment between how the Bank and
respondents view the Bank’s role in
Argentina. There is strong consensus that
the Bank should target i t s resources at
education, infrastructure, and governance,
and that the goals o f Bank support should
be to reduce poverty and bring about
growth, strengthen education and health
care, rebuild infrastructure,
reduce
corruption
and
strengthen
social
protection.
Respondents in both the
survey and the interviews were clear that
they believe the bulk o f Bank support
should be in the form o f investment
lending.
The interviews indicate that
investment operations are viewed as
delivering
concrete
benefits while
adjustment lending i s seen as loaded with
conditions and harder to monitor. The
2004 CAS centered Bank support on the
kind o f investment lending favored by
respondents. It i s also where assistance
under the CAS is planned.
8.
At the same time, however, the
main survey reveals concerns with respect
to the perceived effectiveness o f these
interventions.
Respondents gave an
average rating o f 5.6 out o f ten to the

142

question
o f the
Bank’s
overall
effectiveness.
Participants from local
government and ministries were the most
favorable,
while
academics,
parliamentarians and representatives from
civil society were the least. In addition,
there i s a disconnect between what the
Bank i s perceived to be good at and what
both the Bank and respondents together
believe i s most important. The biggest
gaps in this context are poverty reduction,
addressing corruption and improving
transparency
in
governance-areas
identified as most important for Bank
involvement by respondents, but in which
the Bank i s perceived to be relatively less
effective.
Benefiting from the Survey

9.
Client surveys are a valuable tool
in all client countries, but such an exercise
can be particularly useful in a country such
as Argentina. First, because the country i s
emerging from a severe crisis; second, as
stated above, because o f the perceived
linkage between the Bank and the policies
o f the 1990s.
10.
Both research instruments, but
particularly the interviews, indicate that
there i s a split between the way official
respondents and those from the private
sector and civil society view the role o f the
Bank in the national discourse. One view
that i s more closely aligned to the
Government holds that the Bank should
not
state
its
opinions
and
recommendations on broad policy reforms.
Another view that i s more closely aligned
to parts o f civil society, and particularly
the private sector, holds that the Bank can
stimulate
important
debate
by
disseminating its arguments and ideas.
Those supporting this view feel that the
Bank i s in a unique position to provide

Annex I
Argentina Client Research

2005, which brought together more
than 1,700 participants to address
the issue o f Youth and Values, i s a
step in this direction. A study
planned for FY07 on Youth at Risk
will also be timely.

international comparisons on key and
sometimes sensitive issues.
11.
More generally, the Bank appears
to have a better image with civil society,
including the private sector, than with
government authorities.
One possible
explanation indicated by the data may be
that civil society perceives the Bank as
transparent (where the Bank scored
generally high) and flexible, as well as
open to different opinions, while concerns
about the Bank as bureaucracy and too
technocratic seem to have prevailed
among officials.

0

12.
The environment for the Bank in
Argentina i s likely to remain challenging,
as uncertainty with respect to the
Government’s long term development
strategy continues. In this context, the
challenge for the Bank i s to use the results
o f the research to:
0

Address weaknesses. There i s
clearly a need to consider the
issues o f effectiveness raised in the
survey, and to look at why in some
cases Bank support i s perceived to
be weakest in high priority areas.
The Bank should continue to build
on i t s outreach to address concerns
raised in both surveys about i t s
understanding o f domestic political
and social dynamics, The Southern
Cone Development Marketplace o n
Youth and Values, held in June

143

0

Build on Strengths. The strong
emphasis o f the Bank’s support on
infrastructure,
health
and
governance i s clearly well targeted
and welcome. These areas come
through as the top priorities among
respondents in both surveys and
constitute a substantial share o f the
Bank’s current lending portfolio.
Another positive finding o f the
main survey i s the quality o f the
Bank’s
engagement
with
stakeholders at the provincial level.
The efforts made to strengthen this
engagement have paid off, and the
CAS will continue to expand
support at the provincial level.
Seize Opportunities with the
Private Sector. More than 65
percent
of
private
sector
respondents believe that the Bank
should be more involved in
Argentina.
They are strong
supporters o f the Bank’s key
objectives,
with
particular
emphasis o n governance, education
and infrastructure. These are the
three areas o f significant focus in
the CAS.

Argentina: CAS Completion Report

Date o f CAS:
Date o f Supplemental Note

January 29,2004
April 5,2004

Report No. 27340-AR
Ref: R2003-0207/2

Summary
T h i s document contains an evaluation of CAS objectives in Argentina together with the respective
contributions o f the Government and the Bank during the time segment of the CAS (April 2004 through
December 2005) that was considered by the Board in April 2004. The 2004 CAS was written in exceptional
circumstances at a time when Argentina had recently emerged from the deepest economic crisis in recent history
and the Bank was still in the process of establishingan operational relationship with the newly elected
Government of President Kirchner who assumed office in May 2003. As a result o f the uncertain country
situation, the Board date for the CAS was twice postponed and, after consultations with Executive Directors,
management asked only for endorsement o f a 20 month operations program although the CAS had been drafted
with a 4 % year horizon in mind.
The truncated 20 month term o f the CAS makes it difficult to identify and evaluate outcomes over so
short a period. While the CAS was results based, it did not distinguish clearly between overall country
objectives and CAS-specific objectives which adds further to the difficulty o f evaluating outcomes.
Broadly speaking, overall country outcomes have been very good. During the CAS period 2004-05
Argentina further consolidatedits economic recovery with GDP growth of 9 percent in 2004 and an estimated 8
percent in 2005. Fiscal policy has been well disciplined and inflation has been kept under control although it
began to increase again in 2005. The resolution of structural issues left over from the crisis proceeded at a slower
pace. In June 2005 the Government completed a debt swap covering 76 percent of bonds in default but that still
left U S 2 4 billion of defaulted debt outstanding and unresolved as well as US$4 billion of arrears to the Paris
Club. The renegotiation o f public utility and infrastructure concessions i s lagging and has been complicated in
many cases by litigation pending before ICSID.
From an operational viewpoint, the lending program proposed in the 2004 CAS represented a radical
break with the past. Whereas adjustment lending had previously been the principal vehicle for Bank assistance
to Argentina, it was to account for only one quarter o f the US$2 billion lending envelope envisaged for 2004-05.
Consistent with the wishes of the new Government, investment lending was to account for the remaining 75
percent.
T h e shift from adjustment to investment lending was a challenge for both the Government and the
Bank because the economic crisis, the preceding recession and a downsizing of public sector investment in the
nineties all had seriously impaired the performance of the existing investment portfolio and weakened the project
preparationand implementation capability of the Government. Furthermore, the short period and limited lending
authority constrained the medium-term strategic framework o f the CAS and led the Government to question the
depth o f the Bank’s commitment to the program.
Working within those constraints while, at the same time, pursuing a longer-term sector engagement,
staff made use of available instruments, including APLs to build-up a project pipeline that could be sequenced
according to progress with the sector policy framework, implementation capacity and in the fiduciary
environment. At the same time, a determined and successful effort was made to revitalize portfolio performance.
As a result, by November 2005, significant progress has been made towards fulfilling CAS operational targets
and objectives. The Bank has effectively established a partnershipwith the Government that will serve as the
centerpiece for an investment-based CAS going forward.
The Bank initially found it difficult to engage the Federal Government in a policy dialogue except in a
few sectors such as health and road transport. More recently the dialogue has opened up in areas relating to the
linkages between growth, poverty and inequality and there has also been a good dialogue with some of the
provinces. However, an Economic Recovery Support SAL that was approved by the Board in June 2004
remains unsigned because of continued uncertaintiesin the macroeconomic framework including the indefinite
postponement of the IMF third review of a stand-by arrangement. The difficulty of proceeding with adjustment
lending the absence of a sound policy dialogue vindicates the decision to shift the Bank program to investment
lending where progress has been good.

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

Part A: Long-Term Strategic Goals
The Government’s perspective

1.
In the post-crisis environment o f Argentina, i t appears that a new policy
framework i s emerging. Whereas, throughout the nineties, the role o f the state in the
economy was steadily retrenched, that process i s now being reevaluated and, to some
extent, reversed. There appears to be a broad consensus that the Government should
exercise a more proactive role in addressing the long-standing social problems that were
exacerbated by the crisis and that s t i l l beset Argentina notwithstanding a strong recovery
and good outcomes in terms o f macroeconomic performance. Social transfer programs
for the poor were extended to a significant proportion o f the entire population at the time
o f the economic crisis. The Government has also become much more directly involved
in decisions affecting the provision o f infrastructure and public services, including the
control o f tariffs and investments to increase access. Government practice has favored
discretionary intervention which has not always been exercised within a rules-based
framework and the Government has yet to develop a longer term-vision that can be
systematically implemented within a credible institutional framework. Therein lies the
future challenge.

When President Kirchner took office in M a y 2003 he outlined the principal goals
2.
o f his administration in an address to the Congress. H i s first concern was to consolidate
the economic recovery and prepare the ground for sustained growth. Mindful that the
2001 default on public debt was the result o f excessive borrowing and faulty economic
management, he pledged to follow prudent fiscal policies that would secure fiscal surplus
on a consistent basis. In broad terms, the Government has been successful in that
endeavor. Argentina achieved strong growth o f 9 percent in 2004 and about 8 percent in
2005. The primary fiscal surplus o f the consolidated public sector has been in the range
o f 3-5 percent o f GDP and poverty has been significantly reduced although i t remains
above pre-crisis levels.
3.
A second objective o f the Government was to spread the fruits o f economic
growth more equitably. Social services were to be upgraded to increase both coverage
and quality. Efforts would be made to find productive employment in the labor market
for those who had lost their source o f income as a result o f the economic crisis and, as
poverty declined, emergency programs o f poverty relief were to be restructured to better
serve the medium- and long-term requirements for social protection in Argentina. With
assistance from the Bank, significant progress has been made towards those goals, albeit
at a slower pace than anticipated.
4.
A third objective of the Government was to tackle issues o f governance.
Responding to a widespread perception that the management o f public affairs had been
corrupt in the past, the new administration undertook to fight corruption. As part o f that
effort there was to be a reform o f the judiciary, with judicial appointments being subject
to greater transparency. At the same time, the efficiency and effectiveness o f the public

152

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

administration was to be improved. Governance i s an area where quick results cannot be
expected but steady progress has been made in the last two years with assistance from the
Bank.
The Bank’s program o f support

5.
The program proposed in the 2004 CAS was broadly supportive o f the
Government’s program while recognizing that progress would depend critically upon the
effectiveness with which the authorities pursued structural and policy reform. Staff
undertook to prepare regular briefings for the Board on the status o f the Government’s
reform program so that the Board could reassess the pace and level o f Bank support if
necessary.
6.
The CAS envisaged three pillars o f Bank support corresponding to the
overarching objectives of the Government. The Bank strategy in each o f the three pillars
was similar. Lending was to be undertaken in areas where a consensus could be reached
with the Government on an appropriate policy framework. In other areas where there
was not yet a consensus, the Bank would undertake analytic work to help move the policy
dialogue forward.

7.

Sustained economic growth with greater equity was the first pillar o f Bank
support. I t was clearly understood that the policy dialogue in this area would present a
challenge for the Bank because o f a widespread public perception in Argentina that the
2001-02 crisis was due, in part, to poor policy advice from abroad. Accordingly, a major
study was designed in consultation with the Government’ and it has been successhl in
rekindling a policy dialogue in areas relating to the nexus between growth, poverty
reduction and inequality. The policy consensus has not been sufficient to permit an
Economic Recovery Support SAL, approved by the Board in June 2004, to move forward
and the loan remains unsigned. However, the Bank has been able to reach a consensus
both at the federal level and at the provincial level on strategies in several areas o f
infrastructure that are important for sustained economic growth with equity and, as a
result, good progress has been made with new investment lending, particularly in road
maintenance, water supply and flood control. The IFC has also been very active in
Argentina during the CAS period. I t has facilitated financial sector restructuring as well
as helping expand production and efficiency in diverse sectors with a special focus on
exports.

8.
Strengthening social inclusion was the second pillar o f Bank support. Because
o f the economic crisis and its aftermath, social policies figured prominently on the
Government’s agenda and i t was receptive to Bank assistance. A loan to help finance a
program o f emergency assistance to unemployed heads o f households (Jefes de Hogares)
was already substantially disbursed when the Board considered the 2004 CAS. An
important focus o f Bank assistance during 2004-05 was to work with the Government in
refocusing the program from emergency assistance to a sustainable program that
addresses the longer-term needs o f the poor including higher levels o f labor market
“Argentina: Seeking Sustained Growth and Social Equity” Report No. 32553-AR, October 21,2005.

153

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

participation. To that end, a Heads o f Households Transition Project has been prepared.
I t draws upon Bank analytic work on building skills for the labor market. The Bank also
sustained a fi-uitful dialogue with the Government on health and education policies during
2004-05. Investment loans for maternal and child health care and for rural education,
approved in 2004 and 2005 respectively, will help advance the Government’s program in
those areas.
Promoting better governance was the third pillar o f Bank support. The
9.
Government had announced ambitious plans to improve public administration, uphold the
r u l e o f law and fight corruption. The CAS sought to support those efforts by helping to
improve the public administration through the introduction o f management information
systems and incremental improvements in specific key institutions. Making use o f
ongoing investment loans while, at the same time, developing a new project pipeline the
Bank has helped improve procedures for project evaluation and budget administration at
both the federal level and the provincial level. The social security administration agency
(ANSES) was one focus o f Bank technical assistance aimed at improving efficiency,
transparency and accountability through a reengineering o f i t s structures and procedures
to enhance service delivery. SINTyS, the system which coordinates data bases across the
Federal Government has also benefited directly from Bank assistance. The Bank has
played an important role supporting decentralization in Argentina and a Sub-national
Government Public Sector Modernization Project will follow-up on those efforts.
Shift toward Investment Lending

10.
The CAS envisaged an important shift in the composition o f Bank lending as
compared with the recent past when adjustment lending had dominated the program. The
view o f the new administration was that, in a post-crisis environment, investment lending
was more in keeping with Argentina’s development requirements, and it requested a
program in which investment lending would amount to 60-75 percent o f the total. The
shift from adjustment to investment lending reflected the relatively l o w priority attributed
by the Government to some o f the structural reforms which the Bank considered
important in order for the on-going recovery to be sustained. I t was also consistent with
the views o f civil society expressed in CAS consultations that the structural reforms
supported by the international community in the 1990s contributed to - or at least did
little to prevent - the crisis o f 2001-02.
11.
Bank staff and management were aware that a shift in the program towards
greater investment lending would pose a challenge. The project preparation and
implementation capability o f the Argentine public administration had been seriously
impaired by, first, a substantial reduction in public investment during the 1990s and,
second, the economic crisis and the recession that preceded it. Progress with the existing
investment portfolio had also been seriously disrupted, and project performance would
depend indirectly upon the strength o f the macroeconomic framework, which could not
yet be considered secure. There was also mounting concern over the slow pace o f
structural and policy reform including the resolution o f outstanding infrastructure and
public concessions issues, recovery o f the financial sector and the settlement o f public

154

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

debt in default. In addition, the Government and the IMF had difficulty in negotiating a
Fund-supported program and, for a brief period, Argentina was in arrears with the Fund.
12.
In v i e w of those concerns, Board presentation o f the CAS was twice postponed
from December 2003 to February 2004 and then again to April 15, 2004. O n that
occasion, after consultation with Executive Directors, management submitted the CAS
for Board consideration together with a Supplemental Note asking only for endorsement
o f the April 2004- December 2005 time segment o f the strategy set out in the CAS
document although the document i t s e l f encompassed a 4% year time frame. A lending
program o f U S 2 billion was contemplated for the period through December 2005, o f
which 75 percent was to be investment lending. Supportive analytic and advisory work
was also contemplated in the CAS.

A program document for an Economic Recovery Support SAL in the amount o f
13.
US$500 m i l l i o n had also been distributed for consideration by the Board along with the
CAS itself. However, on advice from Executive Directors, the proposed loan was
withdrawn and the ERSAL was subsequently renegotiated with the Government to
strengthen commitments for reform before being presented again to the Board in June
2005. Further details o f the renegotiated E R S A L can be found in the section in Part B
below concerning macroeconomic performance.
14.
Directors urged staff to keep the Board informed o f progress towards resolving
portfolio performance problems, and, underscoring the need to identify areas o f structural
reform that m a y merit Bank support, requested a briefing by end June 2004 on the
outcome o f discussions with the Government.
Part B: CAS Outcomes

15.
The 2004 CAS was results based. Explicit country performance indicators were
specified in a CAS Program Matrix, which i s reproduced below as Attachment K1 along
with actual outcomes. N o clear distinction was made in the CAS between overall country
indicators and indicators specific to the CAS itself. Nevertheless, for purpose o f this
completion report an attempt i s made to distinguish between country performance
indicators and CAS-specific outcomes. Since the CAS was drafted with a 4% year
horizon in mind, many o f the performance indicators extended beyond 2005, which
makes i t difficult to assess progress during the truncated CAS period. I t i s sometimes
possible to assess progress anticipated as o f end-2005 by pro-rating the outcomes.
However, in many cases, progress on the ground does not proceed in a linear fashion.
Institutions must first be strengthened and procedures put in place which, once
accomplished, will pave the way for measurable results o n the ground to emerge later in
the period. In addition, much o f the data for 2005 will not be available until later in
2006.
The truncated 20 month period o f lending did not receive endorsement from the
16.
Argentine authorities and i t led them to question the commitment o f the Bank to the
country program. I t also constrained the headroom for project identification and
development at a time when the focus o f the lending program was shifting towards
155

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

investment operations and a new project pipeline needed to be built up from a low base.
In order to develop a sufficiently broad portfolio o f new operations, the Bank had to limit
the size o f individual loans to less than the amount being sought by the Government in
many cases while, at the same time, leaving the door open to possible additional lending
at a future date as warranted by the country context and sector performance. Adaptable
program lending was used to build up a project pipeline that could be sequenced
according to progress with the sector policy framework, implementation capacity and in
the fiduciary environment. The alternative o f sequenced sector investment loans was
perceived by the Government as falling short in terms o f Bank commitment to the
medium-term investment program.

The summary matrix above compares CAS targets with outcomes in broad terms
during 2004 and 2005. I t presents the highlights o f the CAS program matrix. Broadly
speaking, i t reveals that the Bank has successfully switched to investment lending in
Argentina. Portfolio performance has greatly improved and a new pipeline o f operations
has been developed. The country dialogue has been successfully pursued in many
provinces and a number o f key sectors at the federal level such as health, education, road

transport and public administration. Even in the area o f macroeconomic policy, where the
country dialogue has met with greatest resistance, Bank analytic work has succeeded in
making progress. During 2004 and 2005 a solid foundation has been laid for the Bank to
move forward in partnership with the Government based o n a program o f investment
lending and analytic work.
Pillar I : Sustained economic growth with greater equity
Overview

18.
Sustaining the recovery from crisis was at the forefront o f the Government’s
program during 2004-05. I t was clearly understood that the recovery could only be
sustained if there was concerted action on many fronts. Hence, the first CAS pillar was
multi-faceted and the CAS objectives were similarly diverse. The broad outcomes are
summarized below. Details are to be found in Attachment K1.
19.
Country outcomes were very good during 2004-05. Economic performance
exceeded expectations both in terms o f growth and in terms o f poverty reduction. A
Bank study on Growth and Equity concluded that fiscal policies were indeed pro-poor.2
However, economic management in other areas fell short o f targets. There s t i l l remain
unresolved issues concerning the renegotiation o f public service concession contracts and
uncertainty about the regulatory framework governing those services. As a result,
investment i s recovering only slowly. The financial sector has largely recovered but
many banks have closed their doors and the system i s now dominated by publicly owned
banks which have not yet been restructured. As far as external debt i s concerned, the
Government negotiated a debt swap for 76 percent o f bonds in default but that still left
outstanding some US$24 billion o f bonds in default and without any agreement with
creditors. In addition, some US$4 billion in Paris Club and other bilateral debt remains
in arrears.
20.
CAS outcomes during 2004-05 were also positive in many respects. Portfolio
performance improved significantly and a pipeline o f new investment projects was builtup in the infrastructure sectors. Progress was made towards reestablishing a dialogue with
the Federal Government and the Central Bank on selective issues o f economic
management. The dialogue with many provinces has been good.
Macroeconomic Performance

21.
When the CAS was prepared, the Argentine economy was recovering strongly
from the 2002 crisis. T o a large extent the recovery constituted a rebound from the
massive decline in GDP that had taken place during the crisis and that had l e f t the
economy with excess productive capacity and record high unemployment. A massive
devaluation o f the peso together with a sharp decline in real wages greatly increased the
competitiveness o f Argentine tradable goods and services. N e t exports increased sharply
in 2002 due to a major contraction o f imports and a more modest expansion o f exports.
“Argentina: Seeking Sustained Growth and Social Equity” Report No. 32553-AR, October 21,2005.

157

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report
In addition, merchandise exports benefited from high commodity prices. The boost to
growth imparted by net exports in 2002 sparked the initial rebound in GDP which
eventually led to an expansion o f consumption which hrther fueled the recovery.

22.
The recovery progressed even better than anticipated as evidenced by the
macroeconomic indicators in Table 1 below. Whereas, in the CAS, real growth had been
estimated at 8 percent in 2003 and 6.5 percent in 2004, the actual outcomes turned out to
be 8.8 percent and 9 percent respectively. Macroeconomic performance in 2005
continued to be good. Growth i s projected to be in the 8 percent range. Trade has also
continued to grow, with exports increasing by 17 percent in U S dollar terms in 2004. In
2005 there was a further 12 percent increase in exports and a favorable balance o f trade
estimated at some US$9 billion.

Within the context o f a strong recovery, fiscal performance has also exceeded
23.
expectations. The ratio o f revenues to GDP has been buoyant in part because o f strong
growth and also because o f improved tax collection. The new taxes that had been
introduced on exports and on financial transactions after the crisis now account for about
18 percent o f federal revenue. As a result, the primary surplus o f the consolidated public
sector reached 5.1 percent o f GDP in 2004 and i t i s projected at 4.5 percent in 2005. A
disciplined fiscal and monetary policy has kept under control the inflationary impact o f a
massive devaluation so that, after an initial 41 percent surge in prices in 2002
immediately following the devaluation, consumer prices rose by only 3.7 percent in 2003
and by 4.4 percent in 2004 (measured year-end). However, with the approach o f
congressional elections, the pressure on prices began to increase again in 2005 and
inflation i s expected to reach double digits.
24.
The recovery has not only been strong, but pro-poor as well. Poverty rates during
2003 and 2004 fell below the rate specified in the CAS country performance indicators.
Whereas the CAS program matrix had targeted a reduction in the level o f poverty from
55 percent in 2003 to 48 percent in 2005, the poverty level had already been reduced to
38.5 percent by the third quarter o f 2005. Similarly, extreme poverty was already
reduced to an estimated 14 percent in the third quarter o f 2005 - well below the 21
percent matrix target. Unemployment was reduced to 17 percent in 2004 (including as
unemployed those Jefes program beneficiaries that are participating in workfare and
searching for employment) and to a further 12.5 percent as o f the third quarter o f 2005.
25.
Yet despite the progress, poverty still remains a problem in Argentina. The 38
percent level estimated for 2005 was s t i l l higher than the pre-recession level o f 30 percent
in 1998. Likewise, the incidence o f extreme poverty, estimated at 13 percent in 2005,
remains high. Inequality has increased, as documented by the Bank study entitled
“Seeking Sustained growth and Social Equity” (Report No. 32553-AR).
There are other caveats to the overall good economic performance o f the past two
26.
years. Particularly worrying is the reemergence o f inflation. Most observers expect a
marked deceleration o f growth as the output gap continues to close. Many o f the factors
that have contributed to the robust recovery o f the past two years reflect a rebound from

158

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

crisis, and as such are transitory. As these factors attenuate, it i s expected that the
economy will settle down to a lower growth rate in the medium term. The Government's
o w n medium-term economic projections indicate a rate o f growth declining to 3 percent
over time.
27.
In August 2004, a stand-by arrangement with the IMF f e l l into abeyance and the
third IMF review was postponed indefinitely. The program will lapse in 2006. The
absence o f an active IMF program in Argentina does not necessarily mean that
macroeconomic management will be lax. It nevertheless constitutes a shortfall in the
CAS country performance indicators which called for annual performance benchmarks
and targets to be set by the Government and monitored under an IMF program.
28.
An Economic Recovery Support SAL in the amount o f US$500 million was
distributed for consideration by the Board when the CAS itself was first circulated in
December 2003. However, the loan proposal was withdrawn on advice from Executive
Directors and renegotiated with the Government to strengthen commitments for reform.
Additional conditions were based on the announced government program. When the
Board approved the loan in June 2004, Executive Directors indicated that, prior to loan
effectiveness, the Bank should be satisfied that that the macroeconomic framework
remained sound, taking into account all relevant factors including a third review o f the
Fund-supported program. Although all conditions for release o f the first tranche were
met by the time of loan approval, the loan has not yet been signed. L i t t l e progress has
been made towards fulfilling second tranche conditions.

29.
The ERSAL was presented for Board consideration along with a National
Highways Asset Management APL and the staff took opportunity o f that occasion to
update the Board o n Government progress in defining areas o f structural reform. A
number o f points o f entry were identified in the briefing that might lead to possible active
Bank support including fiscal reform, trade, territorial development and housing.
However, with the exception o f health, the policy dialogue has been limited and the Bank
has not pursued new policy based lending beyond the ERSAL.
30.
A major objective of the Government in the period 2004-05 was to reach an
agreement with bondholders that would resolve outstanding issues stemming from the
default on public debt. The process was protracted, beginning at the 2003 IMF-Bank
annual meetings in Dubai when the Government outlined an initial debt exchange
proposal that was poorly received by private bondholders. A somewhat more favorable
debt restructuring offer was formally launched by Argentina in January 2005 and, in June
2005, the Government announced that 76 percent o f all eligible debt had been exchanged,
making i t the largest debt work-out on record. In NPV terms, the exchanged debt had
been reduced by 75 percent at a discount rate o f 10 percent. As a result, the total public
debt was reduced from US$191.3 billion as o f end 2004 to US$126.6 billion as o f April
2005 (excluding capital and interest in default held by debt restructuring holdouts o f
about US$24 billion). Measured as a percentage o f GDP, public debt declined from 125
percent as o f end 2004 to about 73 percent using the 2005 GDP estimate. The approach
pursued by the Government to debt restructuring was widely perceived as confrontational
by bondholders and the settlement still l e f t outstanding some US$24 billion o f bonds in
default and without any agreement with creditors. In addition, some US$4 billion in
Paris Club and other bilateral debt remains in arrears. Hence, the CAS performance
indicator that envisaged the conclusion o f public debt restructuring in 2004 was less than
fully met.
Recovery of the Financial Sector

31.
The economic crisis o f 2001-02 had particularly serious consequences for the
financial sector. When the Convertibility Plan was abandoned and the peso f e l l to one
third o f i t s previous value, many financial institutions were caught with a serious
currency mismatch between assets and liabilities. Their plight was exacerbated when, by
government decree, dollar-denominated assets and liabilities were converted to pesos at
different exchange rates (known as “asymmetric pesification”). Further losses were
incurred as a result o f asymmetric indexation whereby deposits were indexed to
consumer prices while some loans were indexed to wages. Temporary protection was
provided to financial institutions when the Government introduced measures to restrict
the withdrawal o f deposits (known as the “corralito” and the “corralon”) but that
protection came at the cost o f further eroding public confidence in the financial system
and i t was not water-tight. In some cases, depositors were able to secure court orders
(amparos) for the release o f frozen deposits at the prevailing market exchange rate o f 3
pesos to the dollar.

160

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

32.
When the CAS was prepared, financial institutions were already attempting to
restructure and adapt to a radically different post-crisis environment. The Argentine
courts had recognized their right to compensation for losses suffered as a result o f
asymmetric pesification and negotiations were underway with the Government
concerning the amount of compensation due.
33.
Acknowledging the central importance of a well-functioning financial sector for
sustained growth with equity, the CAS included performance indicators for the recovery
o f the financial sector, even though the CAS Program Matrix clearly recognized that the
Bank was no longer engaged in a sector dialogue with the Government. Subsequently,
the Bank had occasion to partially reopen the dialogue when, on the advice o f Executive
Directors, the Economic Recovery Support SAL was renegotiated. That dialogue was not
sustained because of the delay in loan signing. However, more recently, the Central
Bank o f Argentina has been open to renewed dialogue. Discussions have begun on
measures to combat money-laundering and on organizing a seminar to discuss a wide
range o f financial sector issues.
34.
Good progress is being made with respect to country performance indicators for
the financial sector. A short term objective articulated in the CAS was that full
compensation should be paid to banks. As o f end-October 2005, banks had received 90
percent o f the AR$8.6 billion in compensation recognized by the B C R A for the
asymmetric pesification o f domestic dollar denominated liabilities. Also as o f endOctober 2005, the Government agreed to issue bonds in the amount o f AR$77 million to
compensate banks for losses due to asymmetric indexation. The flow o f new amparos i s
declining and will end in 2006 when the last deposits held at the time o f the crisis come
to maturity.
35.
Another of the short-term country performance indicators cited in the CAS was
that regulatory forebearance on loan classification and provisioning should be eliminated
by end-2003. In practice, many banks had not yet fully restructured and their still-weak
financial position did enable them to comply with normal regulatory standards.
Prudential regulations are now being reinstated gradually in accordance with the financial
tolerance o f the banking system. However there was a partial relaxation o f regulatory
requirements in mid-2005 allowing banks to acquire new bonds that had been issued
following the debt exchange.
36.
Similarly, compliance with international standards on bank regulation i s
constrained by the financial position o f the sector. Following the suspension o f
international standards by Argentina in 2003, there has been progress in reinstating them
in accordance with the financial tolerance o f the banks but full reinstatement i s s t i l l some
time away.
37.
I t was also a short-term country objective that, by end-2004, an action plan should
be drawn up for restructuring publicly-owned banks. This has been done for the Banco
Provincia (the provincial Bank o f Buenos Aires) but not for the other major public bank,

161

Annex L

consultants to prepare an action plan for the Banco Nacidn.

Banco Nacidn.

38.
The medium-term indicators o f country performance identified in the CAS are
also progressing albeit slowly. Financial intermediation is improving albeit from a very
l o w level. As of August 2005, bank intermediation, as measured by total bank assets,
increased by 6.5 percent with respect to the previous year. Total deposits increased by
some 15 percent in the same period. Private sector deposits accounted for most o f the
increase o f bank deposits in 2004, increasing to AR$129 billion. Overall credit to the
private sector grew from 7.8 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 8.3 percent in 2004 and to 9.8
percent as o f August 2005.
Infrastructure

39.
The Bank has a long-standing association with infrastructure development in
Argentina that continues today. The acute recession which began in 1998 and which
culminated in the economic crisis o f 2001-02 had a serious impact upon the sector. First,
the squeeze o n budget resources resulted in a sharp reduction o f investment and slower
progress with Bank financed investment projects which suffered from insufficient
counterpart funding. Second, the crisis itself disrupted infrastructure concession
contracts that had been predicated upon the dollar and the peso being interchangeable at
par, The issues at stake in renegotiating infrastructure concessions are examined in detail
in the following section. This section is concerned with issues o f investment and
maintenance in physical infrastructure.
40.
The CAS program matrix specified a number o f country performance indicators
as medium term goals. As far as roads are concerned, the objective was that 90 percent
o f national non-concessioned roads and 50 percent o f the provincial road network should
be in good condition within a period o f five years. By 2004, some 92 percent o f national
non-concessioned roads were found to be in “good or fair” condition and the
corresponding percentage for provincial non-concessioned roads was 86 percent. A
breakdown between “good” and “fair” i s not currently available. Medium-term goals
were also specified for water supply, sewerage services, gas and electric power where the
emphasis was upon increasing the availability o f service to the poor. Progress with those
performance indicators has been slow. At the present juncture it i s difficult to compare
actual progress with CAS targets because the institutional and policy framework must
first be revitalized before results can be seen on the ground.

A positive achievement o f the two year period 2004-05 has been to revitalize
41.
many investment projects that had fallen victim to the recession and to the economic
crisis. An example i s the Buenos Aires urban transport project that was approved by the
Board in May 1997. That project, which sought to support infrastructure improvements
governed by concession agreements between the Government and the private sector, to
assist the improvement o f traffic safety and environmental quality and to help develop an
integrated road and rail transport system in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area,
languished for many years as a problem project. I t has been turned around in the last two

162

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

years and prospects are now good that it will achieve all i t s development objectives
satisfactorily.
42.
A notable improvement in portfolio performance enabled the Bank to develop
follow-up operations which built upon the experience o f previous investments and
extended their benefits to a broader public. In that context o f a 20 month CAS which
authorized only limited headroom for lending, the adaptable program loan was the
instrument o f choice which enabled the Bank to adopt a sequenced approach based upon
progress in the sector policy framework, the fiduciary environment and implementation
capacity. The A P L became, in effect, a risk management tool in a context o f weak
project execution and, at the same time, a tool that permitted multiple initiatives to be
taken on many fronts. A loan in the amount o f US$200 million was approved in
December 2004 for an infrastructure APL in the province o f Buenos Aires. I t included
components in roads and drainage as well as in water supply and sewerage. Since the
province o f Buenos Aires s t i l l faces tight fiscal constraints, an important part o f project
preparation was to review the fiscal framework and carefully screen investment priorities
in the light o f resource constraints. Hence, the operation provided a context for
addressing issues o f fiscal policy at the provincial level at a time when the CAS was
moving away from policy lendingper se.
43.
In June 2005, the Bank also approved a loan in the amount o f US$lSO million for
a provincial road infrastructure project which built upon the accomplishments o f an
ongoing provincial roads project. The project was demand-driven and it responded to
investment proposals from six provinces. The operation aims at improving the reliability
of roads to facilitate market access and to enhance competitiveness.
44.
Another example o f mobilizing previous operational experience was an adaptable
program loan in the amount o f US$200 million for a national highway asset management
project which received Board approval in June 2004. Building upon the experience o f an
ongoing national highways rehabilitation and maintenance project it expanded the
National Highway Directorate’s C R E M A program whereby the rehabilitation and
maintenance o f the non-concessioned primary road network is financed through multiyear performance-based contracts. The Bank i s providing finance for about 8,000 km o f
road maintenance corresponding to some 40 percent o f the target network. Other
components o f the operation focus on bridge restoration, construction management, road
safety and transforming the National Highway Directorate (DNV) into a results-based
organization. The results o f the 2005 initial bidding round for the new highways project
raised fiduciary concerns that prompted the Government to cancel the round and
introduce a number o f corrective actions. The L C R region requested INT participation in
support o f this effort. If these initial problems can be overcome, the project could have a
significant development impact because, in a post-crisis environment, there i s a large
backlog o f road maintenance investment to be satisfied. Meanwhile, good progress i s
being made on parts o f the project that relate to strengthening the DNV. Consultants
have been engaged to undertake a diagnostic o f human resources and a program o f
technology modernization is under way.

The promotion o f public-private partnerships

45.
Private-public partnerships have been used extensively in Argentina as an
instrument for the maintenance and improvement o f infrastructure. In recognition o f
their importance, public-private partnerships were an explicit thematic focus o f the CAS
and they were incorporated into the renegotiated ERSAL. The financial position o f
public utilities and infrastructure concessions had been severely compromised at the time
o f the economic crisis because, in many cases, the tariffs they charged to customers were
denominated in (devalued) pesos and frozen by the Government while their balance sheet
liabilities and their debt service obligations were denominated in dollars. The
Government established a special agency (UNIREN) to renegotiate public service and
infrastructure concessions and special “fast track” procedures for Congress to ratify
proposed amendments to the concessions. They also introduced a number o f measures in
preparation for the adjustment o f some public utility and infrastructure tariffs.
46.
For purposes o f second tranche release, the renegotiated ERSAL incorporated a
number o f other performance criteria that had been included in the CAS program matrix,
and thereby brought them into an operational context. Specifically, second tranche
actions focus o n the resolution o f disputes in public-private contracts. They call for
UNlREN to reach agreement with at least 39 concessionaires on the renegotiation o f
contracts. They also call for progress in strengthening the regulatory framework and for
approval and implementation by the Government o f a plan to restore normal operations
o f a stabilization fund for the wholesale electric power market.

With respect to the regulatory framework, an implementation status report for the
47.
E R S A L dated April 2005 noted that, “There is also uncertainty about the orientation of
the draft framework law for public utilities that was presented to Congress. The tranche
condition specipes that the regulatory framework in the public services and
infrastructure sectors should be, inter alia, consistent with the renegotiated concessions
and supportive of private sector participation in the provision of these services. The
initial draft presented to Congress did not fully comply with the criteria speciped in the
Loan Agreement. ’’
48.
The renegotiation o f contracts i s behind schedule. O f the original 63 contracts
that required renegotiation, only 22 had reached an agreement with the executive branch
and 7 renegotiated contracts had been approved by Congress as o f October 2005. The
Government waited for another13 concession contracts o n toll roads to reach their date o f
expiration and i t cancelled a concession contract for postal services prior to assuming
ownership and control. Three years after tariffs were frozen, a further 27 contracts still
await resolution.
They include concessions in such strategic areas as
telecommunications, water, sewerage, gas and power transmission and distribution.
Continued delay in renegotiating public service and utility contracts has serious negative
implications for new investment which i s at a standstill in many cases.
49.
Litigation has added to the complexity o f renegotiations in many cases. As o f
October 2005, there were 35 arbitration proceedings instituted by foreign investors

164

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

against Argentina in ICSID. The proceedings have been initiated under bilateral
investment treaties (BITs) concluded by Argentina which call for dispute settlement
under the ICSID Convention. In 32 cases the claimants contest measures adopted by
Argentina in 2002 - devaluation and/or freezing o f utility tariffs - which allegedly
violated investors’ rights under the BITs. Most o f the claims concern concessions for
public services. The Government has indicated that i t will not conclude renegotiation o f
concessions unless the companies concerned first withdraw from any litigation under
ICSID. In M a y 2005, ICSID issued i t s first judgment on such cases, awarding
compensation to CMS Energy in an amount o f US$133.2 million and the Government
appealed the decision in September 2005.
Progress towards renegotiating the
concessions i s lagging significantly behind the schedule envisaged in the 2004 CAS.
Private Sector Development

50.
Another endeavor identified in the CAS as being o f central importance for
sustained growth with greater equity was the promotion o f private sector development.
In part that would depend upon government efforts to reduce infrastructure bottlenecks
which impair production and distribution to both local and export markets. I t would also
depend upon broader improvements in the enabling environment through a reduction in
red tape and the removal o f financial disincentives such as the export taxes.
There has been notable progress in the revival o f the private sector since the
51.
economic crisis. Indices o f business confidence produced by the University o f Torcuato
di Tella are evidence that the CAS performance indicators have improved greatly. The
consumer confidence index stood at 49.9 in September 2005 compared with a l o w o f 28.4
in September 2002. Similarly, the index o f demand for labor rose from 48 in September
o f 2002 to 117 in September 2005. However, most o f the increase in those indices took
place in 2003 when a new administration was elected. In 2004-05 the upward trend
leveled-off.
52.
Other country performance indicators have also shown progress. Private sector
investment increased from 13.6 percent o f GDP in 2003 to an estimated 16.6 percent in
each of 2004 and 2005. Merchandize exports increased from US$29.6 billion in 2003 to
US$34.6 billion in 2004 and by a further estimated 17 percent in 2005.. Furthermore, new
markets were penetrated. Merchandise exports to destinations other than MERCOSUR,
NAFTA and the EU have accounted for a steadily increasing share o f the total. They
grew by 18.7 percent in 2004 and by an estimated 17 percent in 2005.
53.
Notwithstanding those advances, business indicators continue to reveal a difficult
business environment. There i s no dialogue between the Government and the private
sector. There i s continued concern about the enforcement o f contract rights and there are
many complaints about an uncooperative bureaucracy and the persistence o f red tape.
The IFC has been active in Argentina during the CAS period and committed
54.
US$533 million, including US$175 million for syndications through the B-loan program.
Efforts were focused o n financing companies with strong fundamentals striving in a

165

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

difficult environment, in order to support the ongoing recovery. For those companies the
role o f the I F C was counter-cyclical and it also had a demonstration effect for other
investors. The commitments financed eight projects in five diverse sectors, including
agriculture, food and beverages, the financial sector, retail, and hydrocarbons, with a
focus on exports.

55.
In agriculture, IFC committed a US$lOO million loan to a leading soy o i l export
company (including US$30 million for syndications). This was the first long-term loan to
an Argentine company since the onset o f the crisis. In food and beverages, loans totaling
US$65 m i l l i o n term (including US$lO million for syndications) were provided to two
leading agribusiness exporters. One o f these three beneficiaries, Molinos, was able to
more than double i t s exports. Another beneficiary, San Miguel, has implemented the first
phase o f an innovative waste treatment system for its lemon operations. Another
company, AGD, was able to complete i t s purchase program, thereby benefiting many
farmers and rural intermediaries, thanks to an I F C seasonal facility o f US$60 million
emergency pre-export finance in 2002. A subsequent 2004 loan i s supporting an
expansion program. In 2005, the company processed 26% more than in 2002, and this
should increase by a hrther 29% following an expansion o f capacity. Most o f i t s
revenues are expected to come from exports.
56.
IFC’s investments in the financial sector during the period included a loan o f
US$47.5 million to support Banco Galicia and a US$25 million warehousing loan that
promoted the origination and securitization o f trade and mortgage receivable assets. As
chair o f the creditors committee, I F C has taken a lead role in the important restructuring
o f Banco Galicia as well as in restructuring Banco Hipotecario and Acindar. IFC also
made a US$40 million equity investment in a major retail company at a time when risk
capital was generally scarce in Argentina.

57.

Finally, in the o i l and gas sector, I F C provided US$255.5 million (including
US$135 million for syndications and an exposure o f up to US$5.5 million in a risk
management product) to the Argentine branch o f a leading multinational o i l and gas
producer in support part o f i t s 2005 capital expenditure program. The syndicated loan
had a seven-year term (the longest furnished to an Argentine borrower since the
economic crisis) and i t was oversubscribed.

58.
IFC has made significant progress in restructuring i t s exposure to Argentine
companies, with the exception o f public service concession projects and projects that
were in jeopardy prior to the crisis. The fragile situation o f the financial sector, the
energy crisis and other factors such as the volatility o f commodity prices will, however,
continue to require enhanced portfolio supervision in addition to recovery work on nonperforming loans.
MIGA managed i t s portfolio in Argentina proactively during 2004-05 although no
59.
new guarantees were issued. When the CAS was distributed to Executive Directors, the
outstanding country portfolio o f MIGA consisted o f 20 contracts o f guarantee with a
gross exposure o f US$318.5 million and an exposure net o f reinsurance amounting to

166

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

US$153.7 million. By end-September 2005 MIGA’s exposure in Argentina had been
reduced to 7 contracts for US$60.9 million gross and US$35.5 net.
60.
Three factors accounted for the reduction in MIGA’s country exposure. Some
contracts lapsed when the underlying loan instruments were fully amortized. In other
cases MIGA facilitated a settlement between the clients and their business counterparts
whereby the financial interest o f the client was protected without resort to the MIGA
guarantee. In some other cases MIGA negotiated directly with the BCRA to secure
exemptions for the client from government restrictions that would otherwise have caused
the client to suffer losses.
In FY05 MIGA recognized the claim o f an investor for a loss o f some US$1.4
61.
million on grounds o f expropriation. US$558 thousand o f the claim has been paid.
Discussions between MIGA and the Argentine Government concerning recoveries for
that payment are ongoing and there will be no further MIGA contracts issued with respect
to Argentina until that issue i s resolved. T w o other investment disputes are pending, one
o f which has been brought before ICSID by the guarantee holder in i t s claim against
Argentina. In this instance MIGA i s awaiting a final and binding arbitral award prior to
determining if the actions would fall under MIGA’s contract o f guarantee.

62.
The Bank sought to support Government efforts to improve and streamline the
enabling environment for private enterprise. The ERSAL o f June 2004 included
measures to stimulate exports by expediting the reimbursement o f taxes, duties and
drawback, by facilitating foreign exchange transactions and by improving policy
coordination. They also included action to enhance competitiveness by such measures as
facilitating SME access to credit, promoting R&D, and strengthening quality control.
In addition, the Bank’s extensive portfolio o f investment loans in infrastructure
63.
and public services i s strongly, albeit indirectly, supportive o f private sector
development.

The sustainable use o f natural assets

64.
Since the economic crisis, the rural sector has been one o f the most dynamic
sectors, contributing over half o f all foreign-exchange earnings and export growth. Agrobased exports grew by an average o f 13 percent in 2003 and 2004 and there was a further
increase o f 18 percent in the first eight months o f 2005 compared with the corresponding
period o f 2004. In spite of this, however, Argentina’s deepest pockets o f poverty are still
found in rural areas, particularly in the northern regions. The average income in some
rural areas i s only ten percent of the level in urban areas. Upwards o f 70 percent o f the
rural population i s below the poverty line. The sustainability o f the natural resource base
i s fundamental to both growth and poverty alleviation, whether in the agriculture, water,
forestry, biodiversity, or ecotourism sectors.
65.
The CAS strategy recognized the complexity o f the rural sector by pursuing
activities in three areas, Le., agricultural growth, rural poverty, and natural resources

167

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

management. In support o f growth, the CAS period witnessed the implementation o f
projects in irrigation, rural roads, and rural electrification (Provincial Agricultural
Support Project, Provincial Roads, Flood Management, and Renewable Energy in the
Rural Market Project). In support o f rural poverty alleviation there are ongoing projects
for Small Farmer Development and Indigenous Community Development. In support o f
the underlying natural resources base there are operations in the fields o f Forestry
Development, Native Forest Protection, Biodiversity Conservation, and Marine Pollution
Prevention, all o f which are financed with a blend o f IBRD resources and concessional
GEF resources. Together, these lending activities have provided institutional support
and promoted coordination across the multiple agencies involved (Ministry o f Economy,
Secretariat o f Agriculture, Ministry o f Health and Environment, Ministry o f Tourism,
National Parks Administration, Ministry o f Foreign Relations).
66.
During this CAS period, a new generation o f rural-based post-crisis initiatives
took shape. First, Rural Sector analytic work (FY06) provides a diagnostic o f the
performance and trends o f the Argentine agricultural economy and developed the basis o f
a strategy for new lending. The study identifies needed reforms in irrigation
management, local agricultural extension services, fiscal policies at the provincial level,
animal and plant health surveillance, and export diversification in the non-Pampean
provinces. In parallel to this rural sector work, project preparation has begun in areas
related to integrated water resources management, sustainable forestry management, rural
education, and rural poverty. Serious animal and plant health problems that Argentina
cannot solve without greater regional cooperation were also addressed with FA0 support.
Finally, an active dialogue has been maintained with the Ministry o f Planning, Ministry
o f Economy, and the Secretariat o f Environment, on the issue o f territorial development
with the objective o f more effectively linking land use planning, infrastructure planning,
and local economic development.
The environmental program o f the CAS was, and continues to be, closely related
67.
to the rural development strategy, particularly when it comes to conservation efforts in
water, soil, forests, fisheries, and biodiversity. Ineffective river basin and irrigation
management in the past has led to excessive downstream flooding, soil degradation and
groundwater depletion, as well as deterioration in the quality o f water. The integrated
water resource management project which is currently under preparation will address
those environmental problems. In forestry, where commercial production is fast
developing, the Bank has supported more effective government regulatory oversight.
Bank lending has also supported the protection o f native forests, many o f which have
been degraded by agricultural clearing related to the soybean boom.

68.
A GEF program in biodiversity, marine resources, renewable energy and energy
efficiency was supplemented during the CAS period with an innovative one-of-a-kind
world-wide pilot initiative for "decentralized management o f medium-sized projects"
(MSPs). Under that three year pilot initiative, approved by the GEF Council in FY05,
GEF resources for MSPs are being allocated locally, based on competitive procedures
and managed by a committee comprised o f Government and all three GEF implementing

168

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

agencies. A regional GEF and carbon finance strategy was completed in November2004,
and will be updated annually to guide implementation o f these complex programs.
69.
Another focus o f the environmental agenda relates to the management o f
pollution that i s associated with urban growth and industrialization. Critical issues o f
pollution management include the disposal o f municipal solid waste, which has reached
near-crisis proportions in some urban areas, poor water quality, a deterioration o f air
quality in larger cities, and contamination related to mining. To help address those
problems, preparation o f a municipal solid waste management project has begun,
building on a national strategy supported under the ongoing Pollution Management
project, That project incorporates effective approaches to blending carbon finance with
more traditional nation-wide investment operations in Latin America.
70.
Water quality and air pollution are other important issues addressed in the CAS.
They are the focus o f preparation activities under the integrated water resource
management project and the regional GEF-financed Air Quality Management Initiative,
respectively. Finally, to address contamination issues related to uranium mining and
radioactive waste, the preparation o f a Mining Decontamination project i s well advanced.
Pillar 2: Strengthening Social Inclusion
Overview

71.
Issues o f social inclusion and social protection were o f central importance for the
incoming administration o f 2003 which had to cope with the aftermath o f the 2001-02
economic crisis. This second pillar o f the CAS was, therefore, responsive to the concerns
and the priorities articulated by President Kirchner at the time he assumed office. At that
time, the worst of the crisis had passed and the Government was considering options for
converting programs o f emergency relief into longer-term structures for social protection.
As the recovery gained steam and crisis-driven pressures were reduced, the Government
was able to focus once more o n longer term issues o f education and health. The CAS
sought to support the Government in these endeavors. Details o f CAS objectives and
outcomes are to be found in Attachment K1.
72.
Country outcomes reveal good progress in 2004-05. Employment has expanded
so that fewer people need participate in workfare programs. In particular, there has been
a reduction in youth unemployment and a reduction o f unemployment for the lowest
income quintile. In the health sector, the coverage o f vaccinations has been maintained
at 95 percent and a maternal-child health insurance scheme has been successfully
introduced. In education, preliminary data for 2004 indicates that secondary school
enrollment has increased and repetition rates have been reduced.
CAS outcomes have been very good for this pillar o f the CAS. The Bank has
73.
been instrumental in assisting the Government with a strategy to restructure programs o f
emergency poverty relief to better serve the longer-term requirements for poverty
alleviation while, at the same time, fostering employment generation to reduce the

169

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

numbers o f the poor. There has been a very fruitful dialogue in the health sector and an
adaptable program loan has been approved to support the introduction o f a maternal and
child health insurance scheme. In education the Bank has helped the Government to
devise strategies for the improvement o f rural education.
Reachingvulnerable groups

74.
A program targeted at heads o f households (Jefes de Hogares) had been
introduced in 2002 as the Government’s principal emergency relief vehicle for addressing
crisis induced poverty. About two thirds o f a Bank loan for US$600 million in support o f
the program had been disbursed when the Board approved the 2004 CAS. The program
provided cash relief in exchange for work performed under local government
sponsorship. I t was envisaged that the program would be phased out gradually and
replaced by, o n the one hand, measures to enhance employment and, on the other hand,
an expanded conditional cash transfer program forming part o f a more comprehensive
social safety net.
75.
By virtue o f support hrnished to the Heads o f Households (Jefes) program, the
Bank contributed directly to the amelioration o f poverty in Argentina at a critical
juncture. The previously cited Bank report on Growth with Equity shows clearly that
poverty would have been more pronounced in 2004 had it not been for government
transfers, principally through the Jefes program. The beneficial impact o f the program
was particularly pronounced at the very lowest end o f the income distribution. Indigence
would have been some three percentage points higher without government transfers
financed, in part, by the Bank.
During the CAS period 2004-05 considerable progress was made towards
76.
improving the management o f the Jefes program. At i t s inception in 2002, it had been set
up quickly to deal with a dramatic rise in poverty and it was vulnerable to institutional
weaknesses, particularly in governance. Most municipalities were ill-prepared to assume
responsibility, virtually overnight, to register large numbers o f beneficiaries and
administer so large a program. The L C R Region requested INT participation in project
supervision to better monitor progress. Consequently, in 2003, the Bank investigated the
enrollment process in one o f the largest municipalities. When a new administration took
office in M a y 2003, i t signaled i t s commitment to improve the management o f the
program and, with Bank support, serious efforts were undertaken to restrict the program
to eligible beneficiaries by cross-checking data bases to make sure that all beneficiaries
complied with program requirements. During 2004, staff from the Ministry o f Labor
visited over 1100 municipalities, accounting for h a l f o f all program beneficiaries. By end
2005 the program calls for all benefits to be paid by bank debit cards rather than by
checks, thereby further reducing the scope for the misuse o f beneficiary payments.

77.
Overall, the Jefes program has been very successful in reaching the poor and in
ameliorating the impact o f the social and economic crisis. An estimated 10 percent o f the
participants would have fallen below the food poverty line without the program. A
rigorous impact evaluation has shown that targeting was good. About 40 percent o f

170

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

participants came from the lowest quintile o f the income distribution, while about 80
percent came from the lowest two quintiles which compares very well with similar
programs elsewhere.
78.
An improved Jefes program now provides the basis for a reform agenda that will
redirect the program away from emergency r e l i e f towards a program that will serve the
medium- and long-term requirements for social protection in Argentina. The Bank has
undertaken preparation work in support o f a Heads o f Household Transition Project to
assist the Government in this transition. The key underlying strategy is to identify among
the current program beneficiaries those who have a higher chance o f re-employment and
distinguish them from those who would be better served by a different type o f longerterm safety net, linked to building the human capital o f their children. Policy options for
a reform o f the overall social protection system are currently a subject o f public
discussion in Argentina.
The Government recognizes that formulation and
implementation of a reformed medium-to longer-run social protection strategy will
evolve only gradually. The proposed new Transition Project will assist the overall
Program in testing and evaluating several important strategies to move from emergency
programs to sustainable programs that foster social and human development, including
higher levels o f labor market participation by the poor. Accompanying analytical work
continues to inform the policy debate. I t included a study o f the labor market and issues
relating to skills building, both o f the young and adult population in Argentina. Other
analytic work begun or completed in the course o f 2005 has a direct bearing upon the
broader framework o f social protection as well as on issues o f health and education.
Income security for the elderly who are not covered by any formal pension system is the
subject o f one study. Another study addresses social development issues with respect to
the youth o f Argentina with a special emphasis on poverty, exclusion and gender
segregation.
79.
In terms o f country progress indicators relating to vulnerable groups, Argentina
has partially achieved the CAS objectives. As a result o f labor market improvements and
governance reforms, participants in the short- and medium-term workfare program (the
Jefes program) were reduced from a peak o f almost 2 million in mid-2003 to 1.47 million
in October 2005. A further reduction i s anticipated, but the number o f beneficiaries by
end-2005 will likely exceed the CAS target o f 1 million. Unemployment among the
lowest income quintile has been reduced from 35 percent in 2003 to 29 percent in mid2005 but i s s t i l l well above the medium-term target o f 20 percent. Likewise,
unemployment among the youth fell from 32 percent in 2003 to 27 percent in 2005.
Building an inclusive health system

80.
In Policy Notes conveyed to the incoming administration in 2003, the Bank
observed that Argentina ranks high among nations o f the world in terms o f health related
expenditures, the number o f hospital beds and the number o f physicians. Yet in 2000,
according to data from WHO, Argentina ranked 4gth among nations in health outcomes
and only 75th in terms o f the overall performance o f the health system. I t was an
objective o f the CAS to help Argentina correct the mismatch between the high cost o f

171

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

Argentina’s health system and the modest results that i t delivers. A Health Sector
Review was completed by the Bank in FY03 and it provided a framework for tackling
that issue. In 2004 the Government adopted Plan Nacer, a comprehensive policy
framework for maternal and child health care.

8 1.
The Government and the Bank had previously identified maternal and child health
care as a weak point in the system that needed to be strengthened. The principal Bank
vehicle for assisting the Government in that endeavor was an adaptable program loan in
the amount o f US$135.8 million for a Provincial Maternal and Child Health Investment
Project, approved by the Board in April 2004. That operation followed upon an earlier
sector adjustment loan which had supported policy reforms in preparation for a nationally
financed but provincially executed, maternal-child health insurance scheme. The
investment loan financed the introduction o f insurance to the nine poorest provinces o f
the northwest and northeast regions where the rate o f infant mortality stands at 25 per
1000 live births compared with a national average o f 16.8 per 1000.
Those nine
provinces have the highest proportion o f uninsured and they contain three quarters o f
Argentina’s indigenous population, traditionally a poor and marginalized group. The
operation is preparing the way for future operations that will extend maternal and child
health care to other provinces throughout Argentina.
82.
Preparation o f the maternal and child health care project was greatly facilitated by
the excellent sector dialogue between the Bank, the Ministry o f Health and the provincial
authorities. As a result o f that dialogue the project structure incorporated performance
based financial transfers that aim to change the operational culture o f provincial public
sector health care systems. A new incentive framework is being introduced for health
service contracting and management that rewards providers for achievements in
increasing health care coverage and increasing productivity.

83.
Implementation o f the Health APL has progressed well since effectiveness in
November 2004 and enrollments in the program are proceeding apace. They exceeded
265,000 by September 2005 - equivalent to some 30 percent o f those eligible compared
with a CAS target o f 20 percent. The provinces are fully engaged in negotiating contracts
with health providers and an outreach campaign was launched in the second half o f 2005.
The program has already led to significant administrative improvements. Soon after
birth, most newborns are now getting the national identification documentation needed
for receiving public services whereas previously there were considerable delays.
84.
Health services occupy a prominent place in the social agenda o f the Government
and the role o f COFESA, the Federal Health Council has been revitalized. Good progress
is being made in maintaining vaccine coverage at a level o f 95 percent. Ongoing
programs financed by the Second Maternal Health and Nutrition Project and by the
Public Health Surveillance and Disease Control Project have, in their final year,
performed very well. They have contributed to significant improvements in health
indicators for Argentina over the last two years since the crisis. Infant mortality per
thousand live births f e l l from 16.8 in 2002 to 14.4 in 2004.

Preparing and maintaining a well-educated work force

85.
As in other countries, there i s a close inverse correlation between education and
poverty in Argentina. Bank support for education has traditionally focused on secondary
education where dropout and repetition rates are very high. On average only fifty percent
o f students entering secondary school actually complete it. Among the poorest quintile,
only one out o f every four children completes secondary school.
86.
During the 2004/2005 period, the Government requested Bank support to reduce
existing education inequities, especially with respect to rural education which the
Government considers a key link for revitalizing growth in Argentina. The dialogue o n
education inequities has greatly profited from a skills report which linked education
outcomes to labor market participation and individual earnings.

A secondary education project for the Province o f Buenos Aires had been
87.
approved in December 2000, but, as with many other Bank-supported projects,
implementation was seriously interrupted as a result o f the economic crisis and the
recession that preceded it. During the 2004-05 CAS, efforts to get the project back on
track were successful and implementation i s now proceeding well. However, attainment
o f some development objectives has been impaired by the social and economic
consequences o f the crisis. Completion rates for the targeted grades 7 through 9 and
transition to the next level o f secondary education have declined compared with the 2000
baseline. I t appears that the poverty impact o f the crisis may have caused the decline, in
which case a successful transition from economic recovery to sustained growth should
make i t possible to regain lost ground. There has been good progress with other
development objectives. An extended school day has been established in many schools,
the training o f school principals has proceeded successfully and more schools are
managing their own budgets.
88.
At government request, new initiatives were taken in the 2004-05 CAS period to
extend the scope o f Bank support for secondary education in Argentina. A loan in the
amount o f US$l50 million for a project entitled “Education for a more Productive and
Equitable Argentina - PROMER” i s planned for Board presentation in late 2005. The
principal focus of the project i s rural education. A menu o f options i s to be made
available to authorities at the provincial level so that they may adopt a pedagogic
institutional model that i s tailored to the local context.
89.
The project design o f PROMER benefited from the good sector dialogue between
the Bank, the Ministry o f Education and provincial governments. As a result o f that
dialogue, the disbursement o f project finance will be performance-based. The provincial
governments will be signatories to annual agreements with the Ministry o f Education that
specify baseline indicators and program objectives. There will be an institutional
mechanism to evaluate compliance with the agreements and to agree upon corrective
action where necessary. Continued participation in the program would be contingent
upon satisfactory performance by the provinces.

90.
During this CAS period, a new program was begun to address youth issues and
support youth organizations. Analytic work to survey and analyze issues relating to
youth and to define a future sector strategy i s now underway for delivery in FY07. O f
particular importance was the Southern Cone Development Marketplace (DMP) held in
Buenos Aires on M a y 29-3 1, 2005. The focus o f the event was “Youth and Values”. I t
consisted o f a 3-day learning program on youth issues and the award o f 100 grants for
US$lO,OOO each to youth-oriented service organizations from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay
and Paraguay. O f the 100 grant-winners, 47 are based in Argentina, and the scope o f
services provided range from the environment, to job training, cultural activities, support
to the handicapped, health, education, indigenous peoples, family violence, human rights,
and sports. Trust-find resources have been identified to finance follow-up monitoring
and evaluation.
Pillar 3: Promoting Better Governance
Overview

91,
I t i s widely perceived in Argentina that poor governance and corruption in public
sector management contributed significantly to the economic and social crisis o f 2001-02.
At the same time, there was, and s t i l l remains, widespread public discontent with a surge
in violent crime and insecurity.
92.
Against that background, the 2004 CAS identified three general areas where
action was needed to improve governance in Argentina: accountability and transparency;
institution strengthening; and decentralization. Details o f CAS objectives and outcomes
are to be found in Attachment K1,
Country outcomes are not easy to assess over so short a CAS period. Shortly
93.
after assuming office, the new administration took a number o f high-profile initiatives to
demonstrate i t s commitment to fighting corruption and enforcing the law. Steps were
taken to lift the immunity to prosecution which had protected members o f the armed
forces suspected o f civil rights violations and atrocities in the 1970s. N e w procedures
were introduced whereby judicial appointments and, in particular, appointments to the
Supreme Court would be subject to public scrutiny. Other more specific measures will
enhance the effectiveness o f those initiatives. The Government has expanded the system
whereby public employees disclose their assets. The executive branch is 99 percent in
compliance but the judicial and legislative branches are lagging. Progress has been made
with expanding the coverage and use o f IFM systems and establishing an integrated
personnel registry.

94.
CAS outcomes have been positive in many respects. The Bank has effectively
assisted ANSES , the social security administration to strengthen the efficiency and
transparency o f i t s operations and i t has similarly assisted SINTyS, the federal agency
that cross-checks data bases. I t has assisted the Government to develop and adopt new
systems o f financial management and project evaluation. I t has also helped a number o f

174

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

provincial governments to improve their tax administration, financial management,
human resources management and civil registries.
Fighting corruption and promoting accountability and transparency

95.
The Government has taken a number o f well-publicized initiatives to prosecute
prominent cases o f past corruption, although most o f these cases have yet to be resolved.
The national-level Anticorruption Office has made advances in promoting transparency
and accountability with support under a Bank Institutional Development Fund (IDF)
grant, I t has used the automated assets declaration system to identify conflicts o f interest
and incompatible job holding throughout the federal Executive Branch. I t has conducted
an analysis o f procurement vulnerabilities in support o f the new procurement law and it
has provided input to proposed new legislation on conflicts o f interest and whistle blower
protection. I t has also forwarded 1,000 investigations o f suspected corrupted practices to
the judiciary, and has initiated i t s “plan provincias,” intended to encourage provincial
governments to pursue their o w n anti-corruption activities. At least four provinces have
established, or are in the process o f establishing, their own anti-corruption offices and the
city o f Buenos Aires i s considering setting up an Office o f Ethics. However, setting up
such offices i s not enough, effective progress towards eliminating corruption will also
depend upon a broad agenda o f administrative, judicial and legislative reforms to
improve transparency and streamline procedures.
Notwithstanding numerous
government initiatives, public perceptions o f corruption have not been dispelled.
96.
During the 2004-05 CAS period the Bank supported government efforts to
advance i t s agenda for better governance. Within the context o f an ongoing State
Modernization project, an action plan was developed and agreed in 2004 based on the
new Government’s strategy for enhancing transparency, including e-procurement. The
project i s currently being restructured to include a new component to provide continued
Bank support to the SINTyS project which coordinates databases across the Federal
Government. The SINTyS capacity for cross-checking data bases has already been used
to improve the administration and transparency o f the Bank-supported Heads o f
Household project. In addition, the WBI has furnished training for Argentine civil
servants in matters o f anticorruption.
97.
The CAS program matrix identified two quite specific short-term performance
measures that would be indicative o f progress. The first called for the government-wide
use o f e-procurement systems but progress towards that goal i s proceeding slowly. Only
a few agencies are using e-procurement at the present time. Further progress will depend
not only upon new government initiatives but also upon a more generalized use o f
computerized technologies among the population in general and among suppliers in
particular.
98.
A second short-term country performance indicator was the adoption o f a wellfbnctioning asset disclosure system for senior public employees. The executive branch
o f government, has sustained early progress in that regard and i t now has an electronic
disclosure system with excellent outcomes. An abbreviated form o f individual assets

175

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

declarations i s also available for public inspection. However, the judiciary and Congress
are s t i l l not fully complying with legal requirements for public access to financial
disclosure
99.
In the medium-termthe CAS looked to an improved public perception o f integrity
as indicated by the ranking o f Argentina within the index o f Transparency International.
Between 2003 and 2004 Argentina retained the same 2.5 score within the Corruption
Perceptions Index (published each October) but, because o f an increase in the number o f
countries considered and an improvement in the score o f some other countries, fell in
rank from 92 to 108. The 2005 score was 2.8. Transparency International characterizes a
score o f less than 3 points out o f 10 as indicative o f “rampant corruption” which, in turn,
i s defined as “the use o f public office for private benefit”.
100. A report by the Argentine undersecretary o f public management, also published in
October 2004, cites the poor professional level o f much o f the public sector as an
impediment to effective administration and economic development. In the ministries o f
health and social development, for example, the proportion o f employees with less than
full secondary school education amount to 46 and 40 percent respectively. The l o w level
of education i s reflected in l o w salary levels which may constitute a motive for accepting
bribes.

101. O n the other hand, other surveys are less negative in their results. According to
KPMG consultants “only” 33 percent o f business and civic leaders surveyed claimed to
have been the victims o f fraud or corruption in 2004 compared with 55 percent in 2001.
Furthermore, only 6 percent considered the present Government to be more corrupt than
others in the previous 20 year period.
Strengthening institutions

102. The current Government i s taking an incremental approach to public sector
modernization involving a limited number o f initiatives in selected agencies, in contrast
to the more sweeping, but sometimes unsuccessful reform initiatives o f the past. The
Bank i s extending support for a strengthened system o f social security with a second
technical assistance loan (TAL) for ANSES , the social security administration, was
approved by the Board in July 2005. Building on the results achieved under the first
ANSES TAL which closed earlier this year, the project aims at improving the efficiency,
transparency and accountability o f through a reengineefing o f i t s structures, procedures
and incentive systems to enhance service delivery. In line with ANSES’ strategic plan
for 2005-1 0, the project would foster increased cooperation with other government
agencies including SINTyS.
103. Public expenditure management was another area o f focus for the CAS. With
support from the Bank, a Public Investment Strengthening Project (FOSP) sought to
replace many diverse systems o f financial management within the public administration
with a single unified system. The 2004 CAS identified explicit country performance
indicators against which progress could be measured. The number o f government

176

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

agencies using the updated system o f integrated financial management for internal
preparation and tracking o f budgets (SLU) was one such indicator which reveals
significant progress. The number o f agencies using the system rose from seven in 2002
to 41 in 2004 and hrther to 52 in 2005. The FOSIP project also helped develop a new
system for the identification, preparation, management and evaluation o f public
investment projects. By end-2005 the new system, known as BAPIN 11, had been
adopted by 19 of the 24 provinces and by 110 federal agencies. Training to use the
system has been provided for 752 public employees and 800 private sector participants.
104. Fiduciary weaknesses in the management o f the FOSIP project were identified
during ex-post supervision missions in 2005 and the Bank has engaged the Government
to address these. Strengthened fiduciary measures are being incorporated in the followup Governance 21 operation planned for Board presentation in early 2006. The
Governance 21 project will support further improvements and expansion o f the SLU and
BAPIN systems, as well as new government initiatives for territorial development.
105. The completion o f an integrated registry o f government personnel was another
indicator specified in the CAS. By end-2005, the Government expects to have all the
legal instruments in place to establish the registry and implementation i s set to begin in
2006. However, progress with another short-term indicator - the publication o f
institutional objectives and achievements by key government agencies - i s lagging.
Enhancing effective decentralization

106. The federal structure o f Argentina and the traditional strength o f provincial
loyalties mean that decentralization is an issue o f central importance for effective
governance. During the 2004-05 CAS period a determined and successful effort was
made to accelerate the implementation o f a Second Provincial Development Project, the
principal objective o f which was to assist the provinces to implement public management
reforms that would permit them to improve fiscal performance. A related objective was
to strengthen the capacity o f the provinces to plan, execute and monitor investment
programs that are economically efficient, financially sustainable, institutionally
manageable and environmentally sound. Over the past two years under the project, new
or improved systems were completed for: (i)tax administration in four provinces, (ii)
financial management in four provinces, and (iii)
cadastre systems in three provinces.
Other provinces improved their systems for human resource management, administration,
and civil registry. In the absence o f nation-wide standards, the Bank project has
promoted adoption o f standardized public management systems at the provincial level.
107. The provincial development project has played an important role in supporting
decentralization in Argentina. Improved tax administration has led to better tax-payer
compliance. The proportion o f locally generated revenue in the total revenue o f
provincial governments has risen. The cadastre has been extended to a much more
extensive land area. Improvements in human resource management have resulted in
lower rates o f absenteeism and more streamlined hiring procedures. The project was
closed in June 2005 and a follow-up Sub-national Governments Public Sector

177

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

Modernization Project that will build upon the administrative and management
prototypes established i s planned for Board presentation in late 2005.
108. The Government recognizes the importance o f improved service delivery at the
local level and strongly supports provincial administrative reform. I t has sought to
strengthen the Federal Council for Provincial Relations which has held a number o f
meetings to advance i t s agenda. However, progress towards greater information sharing
has been slow.
109. In the aftermath of the 2001-02 crisis, it was anticipated that the Government
would enact a new co-participation law governing the distribution o f fiscal revenues
between provinces. The enactment o f a new co-participation law was an explicit CAS
performance indicator and a draft reform law was prepared by the federal authorities.
However, the Government was unable to assemble sufficient support among the
provinces for that legislation and the initiative has been shelved for the time being.
A Fiscal Responsibility L a w (FRL) was enacted in 2004 which establishes general rules
for fiscal performance and for ensuring greater transparency in fiscal accounts. The FRL
also provides for the monitoring o f fiscal results as well as for possible sanctions. As o f
September 2005, 17 provinces and the autonomous city o f Buenos Aires (which has
province-like status) had ratified the law. The FRL falls short o f best practice in that it
fails to provide hard constraints on sub-national spending and borrowing. It excludes
important parts o f the budget (such as capital expenditures and IFI-financed
expenditures). It does not contain mechanisms to ensure that sub-national budgets are
consistent with aggregate fiscal objectives and i t continues to allow provinces to pledge
their co-participation receipts for future debt service. However, Argentina’s strong
federal character puts a premium on some degree o f discretion and on consensus in
decision-making, The weaknesses in the FRL may reflect that reality.
The Bank Contribution

110. In Attachment K1, outcomes are summarized for each o f the three pillars o f Bank
assistance, using as a template the Program Matrix o f the 2004 CAS. A comparison o f
programmed and actual AAA, and programmed and actual lending i s set out in
Attachments K2 and K3 respectively.
111, During the 2004-05 CAS period the Bank had to contend with a difficult working
environment in Argentina. There was widespread public perception that the 2001-02
economic crisis was due, in part, to poor policy advice from abroad. The high-profile
presence o f the IMF together with a number o f large policy-based loans from the Bank
had resulted in “policy-reform fatigue”. There was opposition and even outright rejection
o f policy advice from the Bank or from any other external players, be they multilateral,
bilateral or private. As a result, the new administration showed no interest in a
maintaining a broad-based policy dialogue with the Bank. The prevailing sentiment was
clearly reflected in the Government’s request that Bank lending should focus primarily on
investment operations.

178

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

112. The CAS clearly stated the intention o f the Bank “to follow the understanding
adopted in a recent agreement reached by the Government with the IMF whereby
multilateral lenders would maintain their exposure constant through expiration of the
stand-by arrangement in 2006” (para. 111). That understanding f e l l into abeyance when
the third IMF review o f the stand-by arrangement was postponed indefinitely. Given the
macroeconomic uncertainties created by the absence o f an active IMF program, the Bank
was not able to disburse policy-based lending such as the ERSAL. Investment lending
alone was not sufficient to maintain the Bank’s exposure, notwithstanding a successful
effort to improve portfolio performance and build-up the project pipeline. As a result, the
Bank’s exposure in Argentina (borrower obligation) f e l l from US$7.5 billion at end-2003
to US$7.4 billion at end-2004 and to US$7.0 billion at end-September 2005.
113. Notwithstanding that limitation, the Bank was able to engage in an active and
fruithl dialogue with a number o f sector ministries and with provincial governments
where the Bank had an active operations program. As a result o f that dialogue, the
performance o f operations in the Bank portfolio greatly improved. Many problem
projects that had languished for years behind schedule were turned around and are now
doing well. The overall improvement is clearly indicated in the table o f indicators below
which shows a decisive reduction in the number o f problem projects in 2004-05.

114. Nevertheless, project implementation has suffered from constraints on
Government capacity, which has yet to recover from the policies o f the 1990s which deemphasized public investment (public investment in the 1990s averaged l.5 percent o f
GDP, and 1 percent in the 2000s, compared to a regional average o f roughly 3 percent)
and the subsequent economic crisis, which led to further reductions in the capital budget.
This has raised difficulties for the Bank, particularly in the context o f an investment led
strategy in which the portfolio o f investment projects is being almost completely rebuilt.
I t also implies potential problems with respect to maintaining the balance between
commitments and disbursements. Project implementation, i s also being affected by the
broader governance climate in Argentina.
115. Project implementation has also been affected by fiduciary concerns to which the
Bank has responded vigorously to engage the authorities in corrective actions. Bank
support for the Heads o f Household program and a road maintenance project are two
examples. The Heads o f Household program has, since i t s inception, worked to ensure
that benefits are delivered only to those eligible under the program criteria. The Bank has
engaged the Government to address concerns about enrollment, as well as to strengthen
compliance with work and training requirements. The Government has responded by
establishing more transparent internal controls, implementing more strictly the crosschecking o f beneficiaries, shifting the payment system from monthly checks to bank
debit cards, and expanding the scope o f the audit system. In the National Highways
project (CREMA), fiduciary concerns have been identified in the course o f project
supervision. The Government has canceled the first round o f bids and launched an
investigation. The L C R region enhanced supervision o f the Heads o f Household program
and the National Highways project, and requested the participation o f INT. More
generally, the Bank is assisting with projects to strengthen overall public sector

179

management at the federal and provincial levels. I t i s also augmenting i t s analytical and
technical assistance in support o f financial management and procurement.

116. The Bank has also been active with analytic and advisory work throughout 2004
and 2005. Policy Notes were delivered to the Government when it assumed office in
2003, but there was not much receptivity. A public expenditure review and poverty
assessment also carried out prior to the CAS suffered similar fates. However, more
recent studies have been designed to engage the Government under a more explicit
participatory approach and have met with some success. A study on Sources o f Growth
contemplated in the CAS was successfully completed and distributed to the Board in
October 2005 under the title "Seeking Sustained Growth and Social Equity". The shift in
emphasis from a growth study to an analysis o f the linkages between growth, poverty and
equity was in response to a direct request from the Government. I t proved to be an
effective vehicle for initiating a dialogue with the Government on issues o f economic
policy. A study o f skills building for the labor market was published in March 2005 and
i t established the foundation for a deeper sector dialogue in an area receptive to the Bank.
In addition, a study o f old age welfare and social security was begun in late 2005 as well
as preparatory work for a poverty assessment that will focus, in particular, on the
informal sector. The latter study i s benefiting from close cooperation with the Ministry
o f Labor and the statistics agency (INDEC). An Institutional and Governance Review
was undertaken in 2004 to assess reforms in financial management, procurement, human
resource systems, and measures to advance transparency at the federal and provincial
180

levels, The findings o f the review were discussed with the Government and a report i s
scheduled for release late in FY2006.
Part C : Overall Bank Performance and Lessons Learned

117. The Bank i s working to deliver the full program proposed in the CAS,
notwithstanding a radical shift in program composition from adjustment to investment
lending and a difficult country context. The table below shows that project preparation
costs for the Argentine country program compare favorably with other similar countries.

118. Supervision costs, on the other hand, were above average. This reflects the
exceptional effort put into transforming a poorly performing portfolio as well as the high
level o f caution staff maintained with respect to project implementation given the
challenging environment. The cost o f analytic work was also below average although the
individual and heterogeneous nature o f economic and sector reports limits the value o f
cross-country comparisons.

119. The policy dialogue on overall economic management between the Bank, the
Ministry o f Economy and Production as well as other core ministries o f the Federal
Government has been limited. Productive engagement has been possible with some
provincial authorities and the private sector has been receptive to a dialogue with the
Bank. As implementation o f the CAS progressed, the Bank responded to a constrained
policy dialogue by focusing i t s analytic work o n issues where the Government had
expressed interest and by undertaking the analytic work in cooperation with the
authorities. Within that framework a study on Growth and Equity was designed with an
explicit participatory approach and was well received. Studies in health and social
security were also successful in advancing the sector dialogue.
0

Lesson: The Bank will continue to seek opportunities for engagement at all levels
o f government and with the private sector. One entry point i s to identify
analytical work that responds to the interests and needs o f government
counterparts and o f the private sector.

181

Annex L

120. While the interim CAS was realistic in focusing on investment lending for 75
percent o f the proposed portfolio, i t was not possible to insulate the CAS from the
difficulties o f the policy environment and related events. Progress with the E R S A L was
difficult in the absence of a good policy dialogue. As a result o f the suspension o f an
IMF-supported program, the first tranche o f the ERSAL and the last tranche o f the
Cordoba provincial reform loan (PRL) could not be released despite the fact that the
respective tranche conditions were met.
0

Lesson: The maintenance o f country exposure in Argentina proved not to be
feasible for the Bank in the absence o f a broad policy dialogue and an active IMFsupported program

121. The abbreviated 20 month period o f approved lending has proven to be suboptimal with respect to the development o f the investment project pipeline. In the period
2004-05, Bank staff was able to develop new projects in sectors where there were
ongoing operations. The operational strategy was adapted to make use o f the APL as an
instrument that enables the Bank to work within the limited resource envelope
corresponding to a short period o f lending authorization and where the sector framework
i s incomplete.
0

Lesson: For the Bank to build up a strong project pipeline i t needs to adopt a
medium term perspective and to work on a broad front with multiple initiatives.
Implicit in this i s a CAS envelope o f sufficient size and forward vision that would
allow for longer-term planning on the part o f the Bank and the Government. The
APL instrument has proved to be an effective tool for operating under a
constrained CAS envelope and for managing risks when the sector policy
framework i s incomplete.

122. The Government’s project implementation capacity remains limited. This raises
difficulties for the Bank, particularly in the context o f an investment led strategy in which
the portfolio o f investment projects i s being almost completely rebuilt. I t could also lead
to potential problems with respect to sustaining an appropriate pace o f disbursements.
0

Lesson: The Bank should work with the Government to improve its project
implementation capacity. Efforts should be made to integrate enclave project
implementation units (PIUs) into regular l i n e units within the Government. There
has been some good progress in this area.

123. The CAS identified a number o f “exceptional risks” at the country and operational
level, including political and systemic risks. I t concluded that the fiduciary framework
was sound but, in the event, the framework has not been well implemented. As a result,
the operational environment o f the Bank-supported program shifted from moderately
risky to high risk.
0

Lesson: The Bank should continue to focus on systemic issues o f governance and
structural challenges in Argentina to the extent permitted by the country dialogue.

Annex L
Argentina: CAS Completion Report

At the same time i t should develop a specific strategy and action plan to maintain
the fiduciary integrity o f Bank-supported projects.

Another source o f uncertainty during 2004-05 has been the lack o f a clear mediumterm economic strategy on the part o f the Government. In the absence o f a medium-tern
perspective, it i s unclear whether the strong economic performance o f the past two years can
serve as a guide to fbture growth. The experience o f 2004-05 vindicates the view expressed
in the 2004 CAS (page iiio f Executive Summary) that “Although the situation i n Argentina
124.

has stabilized in many respects, there still remain many risks and uncertainties. Close
monitoring and reporting of progress - and problems - has therefore been built into the
proposed program
0

Lesson: The Bank’s post-crisis program should be performance-driven in the
medium-term. It should focus o n those areas where the policy framework and the
operational environment, including governance, permit progress and i t should
continue to provide for the close monitoring and reporting o f progress.
