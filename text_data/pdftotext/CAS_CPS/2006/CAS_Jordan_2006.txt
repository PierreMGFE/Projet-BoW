EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sets out a four year program to help Jordan meet its key
development challenges of reducing poverty and creating jobs while maintaining fiscal stability and
development sustainability.
ii.
This CAS differs from the previous in that the Jordan context for reform has matured, a greater
sense of urgency prevails given the regional volatility, and recent analytical (largely in poverty,
expenditure management and the investment climate) and project work (largely education) have enabled
the World Bank Group to better focus for results and organize for the agility needed to be responsive.
iii.
Jordan’s economy performed well over the past five years with a growth rate of 5-7 percent,
despite regional uncertainties and a poor resource base. This growth has been broad-based, supported by
exports and manufacturing expansion. Jordan has also performed well in terms of human development—
education, health and closing the gender gap in access to basic services. In governance, Jordan has
outpaced most countries in the region, though further improvements are needed.
iv.
Comprehensive structural reforms over the last decade have underpinned the good economic
performance. These reforms have helped improve the environment for private investment, liberalized the
trade regime, supported a robust privatization program, and initiated establishment of modern regulatory
and institutional framework in some key areas, such as energy and water. In the 1990s, Jordan ranked as
one of the best reformers, not only in the region but also compared to other middle income-countries. This
process of structural reforms has been accompanied by a painful, but effective, fiscal consolidation that
has steadily reduced government debt from above 200 percent of GDP in the early 1990s, to around
82.2 percent at year-end 2005. The past three CASs have focused on these reforms.
v.
In juxtaposition to the gains, over the past two years, Jordan has experienced a double external
shock: (i) diminishing external grants; and (ii) doubling of the price of oil. These shocks are experienced
by the population through increasing energy prices and austerity measures dictated by sharp fiscal
constraints which threaten public services and the robust economic growth rate needed to maintain and
improve public welfare.
vi.
Despite the improved economic performance, high unemployment, particularly among the young,
and deep pockets of poverty persist. Jordan’s population growth is among the highest in the region and
nearly seventy percent of the population is under the age of 30. Looking forward, about 60,000 new jobs
and continued strong growth of seven percent plus would be needed each year to avoid higher levels of
unemployment and poverty. Distribution of the gains is geographically uneven. Poverty reduction and job
creation remain Jordan’s most important challenges.
vii.
Sustaining gains, advancing reforms, and cushioning hardships for the vulnerable while managing
external shocks, are the developmental challenges confronting Jordanian economy in the coming years.
This requires carefully calibrated adjustments to the fiscal situation and maintenance of the pace of
structural reform for growth, including a radical upgrading of the quality of education, modernizing the
public sector and modernizing institutions to support private sector development. These efforts need to be
particularly focused on expanding the opportunities and access of the poor and unemployed to share more
fully in Jordan’s growth, while strengthening safety nets and social protection measures.
viii.
To meet these challenges, Jordan has recently developed a National Agenda—a strategic plan that
covers the main development areas, and establishes objectives and broad strategies in an integrated way.
Its main objective is to increase the welfare for Jordanians and to reduce poverty and create jobs through
sustained and broadly-shared growth, while achieving fiscal sustainability and external balance.

ix.
This Country Assistance Strategy, in support of the National Agenda objectives, aims at tangible
progress in poverty reduction and job creation, while assisting the country in its transition through the
medium-term economic shocks.
x.

The Bank program’s under the CAS is organized in 4 cross-sectoral clusters:
•
•
•
•

Strengthening the investment environment for a skill-intensive and knowledge-based
economy;
Supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities;
Reforming social protection and expanding inclusion; and
Restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector reform.

xi.
The first two clusters tackle issues related to private investment and job creation, respectively at
the macro level and at the local level. The third cluster deals with programs to support those who cannot
by themselves achieve sufficient welfare through market mechanisms. The last cluster is focused on the
supporting improvements in the government budget and the administration, as the main tools of public
policy. Important cross-cutting issues, such as gender and the environment, will be mainstreamed into the
clusters. Various sectoral concerns, such as water and energy, will be integrated in these programmatic
clusters through thematic approach.
xii.
The CAS is designed to provide flexibility for interventions. It is not expected that all activities
contemplated in the program will be undertaken. Rather the Bank will respond to Jordan’s main
challenges flexibly through the strategic thrust of the clusters. Thus, the CAS mix among policy lending,
investment lending, and analytical services reflects the emerging needs with respect to short-term
financial challenges and longer-term institutional developments, with a lending ceiling of up to US$540
million over four years. The total CAS envelope for IBRD lending is US$440 million in the base case,
US$175 million in the low case and reaching US$540 million in the high case.
xiii.
Development Policy Lending (DPL) will be considered flexibly in any of the 4 clusters, or could
be designed across the 4 clusters, and be strongly linked to the implementation of the National Agenda to
underscore the ownership of the policy program supported by the Bank policy lending. Investment
lending will focus on implementing institutional reforms, leveraging other donors’ resources, and
linkages to analytical and technical assistance activities. Partial risk guarantees will be considered on
request, provided the overall framework for Public Private Partnership is satisfactorily enhanced.
xiv.
IFC’s strategy will seek new investment opportunities in the private sector to increase its
portfolio, provide strategic and Technical Assistance for private sector development, and carry on
advisory services for private participation in infrastructure and privatization.
xv.
The collaboration between IFC and IBRD has significantly improved, working closely on
privatization, Public-Private partnerships, and enhancing the enabling environment for the private sector.
Going forward, the collaboration will include (i) the design of IBRD’s private sector development (PSD)
diagnostic assessments in order to identify and implement IFC’s technical assistance activities, (ii) joint
identification of Private Participation in Infrastructure opportunities, and (iii) identification of
opportunities for providing sub-national financing through the Municipal Fund. The IFC new field office
in Amman has advanced collaborative efforts. The PSD consultations for this CAS were jointly prepared
and led by the two institutions.
xvi.
While many large donors are present in Jordan, the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage
is in providing integrated support for complex institutional reforms, coupled with its ability to provide
critical financial support if needed. As in many middle-income countries, the Bank's advantages can only

ii

be realized through matching our counterpart’s sophistication and challenges with a more focused
program, higher quality services, more flexibility and a better understanding of its mission in the country.
xvii.

The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
•
•
•

Does the CAS provide for sufficient flexibility and responsiveness?
Is the lending scenario appropriate?
Is the Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) program responsive to both deepening
knowledge as well as addressing progress in institutional development and resource
management?

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT: A TOP DEVELOPMENT PERFORMER IN A
DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT
A.

COUNTRY BACKGROUND

1.
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, with 5.5 million inhabitants, is notably resource-poor, with
limited agricultural land, no oil resources, and considerably scarce water. Its only natural resources are
potash and phosphate. The population is urbanized at around 80 percent, and is one of the youngest
among lower-middle income countries, with 38 percent under the age of 14. Although demographic
growth, currently at around 2.6 percent per year, is slowing, total population is expected to reach almost 7
million by 2015.
2.
Notwithstanding the difficult regional
political environment and the lack of resources,
Jordan
has
achieved
above-average
development outcomes compared to other
lower middle-income countries. This favorable
situation can be credited to sound development
policies, recent capital inflows and to one of the
world's highest levels of unilateral transfers, in
the form of workers’ remittances and public
grants, together amounting to between 20 and 25
percent of GDP.

However, Jordan has not caught up
with the levels of per-capita income it had
attained in the 1980s boom, punctured by the
financial crisis of 1989. The subsequent
structural adjustment period of the 1990s, while restoring some positive economic growth, saw per capita
incomes eroded by strong population growth. Poverty and joblessness are the most important
problems to be solved.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

4.
In 2004, Jordan experienced a “permanent” double external economic shock: (i) the price of
oil more than doubled and free oil delivery from Iraq stopped; and (ii) external grants were sharply
reduced. These shocks caused major fiscal stress through the rising cost of oil subsidies, to which the
Government responded by adopting a strict plan to remove the oil subsidy gradually by 2007 and fully
liberalize the domestic oil market in the beginning of 2008. The external shocks came at a time of strong
economic growth spurred by structural reforms, fiscal consolidation and capital inflows. Average growth
moved from below 3.5 percent on average over 1996-2000 up to 5 percent per year in the 2000-2004
period, despite the Iraq war-induced recession of 2003. Notwithstanding the shocks, real GDP growth
reached 7.7 percent in 2004, and 7.2 percent in 2005. Thus, the economic situation has become much
more complex. Jordan is now entering a period of transition. Following the 1989 recession, more than a
decade of structural and fiscal reform began to show results and so far has helped Jordan to absorb harsh
external shocks. Looking forward, managing the countervailing and increasingly complex demands of
fiscal discipline, debt management, service delivery, and poverty alleviation will require increased
capacity, agility and self reliance.
5.
The recent robust growth of the Jordanian economy, overall, is a symptom of the economy’s
ability to take advantage of evolving positive external circumstances, which allows it to absorb
negative shocks (such as those affecting the energy or tourism sectors). The surge in economic

1

activity has been broad based, and not limited to the robust exports of textiles from Qualified Industrial
Zones (QIZs) and exports to Iraq. (Estimates that take properly into account the low domestic value added
of QIZ exports show that QIZ exports have added on average around 0.7 percentage point of GDP per
year.) Manufacturing value added over 2001-2004 (excluding the slump year 2003) has contributed more
than 35 percent of GDP growth, while the transport and communications sector has contributed another
20 percent, and the financial service, retail and construction sector around 10 percent each. This
predominance of the manufacturing, transport and communication sectors in driving economic growth
from the supply side was even more pronounced in 2004, and continued in 2005.
6.
In 2004 and 2005, the influx of Iraqi immigrants and money, as well as the higher Foreign
Direct Investments (FDI) from oil-rich Gulf countries, has been massive (possibly above 5 percent
and 10 percent of GDP, respectively), and has

also helped fuel economic growth. However, the 6%
macroeconomic impact of these capital inflows has

been offset to a large extent by increased foreign
asset holding of the banking sector, lower external 4%
grants, and by the terms of trade shock represented
by the higher oil prices. The most visible domestic 3%
impact of the short-term inflows has been a real
estate price boom, and an almost 20 percent 2%
increase in private real consumption, which has
lead to a 40 percent increase in non-energy 1%

7.
The external shock led to a sharp
increase in the current account deficit in 2005 to
around 17.7 percent of GDP, and, in the years
to come, Jordan will require continued high
capital inflows to sustain a stable external
position. The current account surplus melted away
due to a larger oil bill and booming non-fuel
imports, although larger net capital inflows
allowed the Central Bank to hold on to a high level
of foreign reserves, which stood at around 5
months of goods and services imports at the end of
2005.

deficit (before grant), however, remained
high—at around 10 percent of GDP in 2005 despite significant fiscal consolidation effort in
response to sharp increase in the cost of oil subsidies and diminishing external grants. Over the next
four years, a number of factors will make fiscal adjustment particularly pressing: the anticipated
continued reduction in foreign grants, the need to continue reducing the cost of fuel subsidies, and the end
of the Paris Club debt rescheduling period after 2007.

9.
Exchange rate policy has been stable. Since 1995, the Jordanian Dinar is fixed to the dollar
at a constant rate. The nominal anchor has helped reduce inflation and stabilize the economy. A
share of Jordan’s trade and external debt is however denominated in other currencies, especially the Euro,
so that the large Dollar/Euro fluctuations of the last five-six years entailed large fluctuations in the Dinar
real effective exchange rate with contrasting effects on external debt, and on Jordan’s price
competitiveness. Since 2005, Jordan real effective exchange rate has depreciated by more than 15 percent,
and is now back to its 1994 level. Inflation was tamed thanks also to the fixed currency peg to the dollar.
The recent surge in economic activity has, however, led to some overheating, with the GDP deflator
growth rate above 4.2 percent in 2004 and 2005 (Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.4 percent in
2005).

C.

POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT – THE TWIN CHALLENGES

10.
The recent Poverty Assessment jointly prepared by the Government and the World Bank
shows that income poverty has been retreating by around a third from 1997 to 2002, with the
national poverty line dropping from 21.3 percent to 14.2 percent of the population. Low per-capita
income growth during the period considered, at 0.8 percent per year, coupled with a slight worsening of
inequality, could not explain such a stark reduction in poverty. Both the survey data and the national
account show, however, that per capita private consumption, increased by a significantly fast 3.5 percent
during the same period. The divergence between income and consumption dynamics seems to be
explained by the changing pattern of growth, which has seen a reduction in public consumption and real
estate investment in favor of private consumption and business investment. The positive trend should not
hide the existence of numerous pockets of deep poverty, as 11 out of 73 sub-districts witness a poverty
incidence above 35 percent. There is no significant difference in aggregate poverty levels between female
and male headed households. Also, the data show that, although unemployment incidence is higher
among the poor, around three-fourths of the working-age poor were actually in active employment.
11.
Unemployment has been hovering between 13 and 15 percent of the labor force in the last
four years, around 12-13 percent for males and 20 percent for females. Jordan has a small labor force
relative to its population, a combination of a high dependency ratio and a low female labor participation
rate. The peculiarity of the labor market is the high number of Jordanians working abroad (estimated at
around 25 percent of the total labor force), mainly in the Gulf countries. At the same time, Jordan
employs numerous low-skilled immigrant workers, especially in the agriculture, construction and
domestic services.
12.
The higher economic growth and the lower poverty rate have not translated yet into a
widespread perception of enhanced welfare by the population. Perceptions of inequality and
favoritism are a rising concern in the country. The Government is aware of this sentiment and has tried
over the last four years to tackle the situation with both short-term and long-term measures. In particular,
it launched in 2002, the Social and Economic Transformation Plan (SETP), a mainly off budget, donorfunded investment program whose objective was to implement poverty-related projects and reforms that
could show a quick tangible impact on the ground. This initiative has been integrated into the 2004
budget. The recent evaluation of the SETP, however, indicated relatively positive results.

D.

GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

13.
International assessments of Jordan’s systems for governance generally give the country
good marks in comparison with most other Arab states, though some problem areas persist. The
Constitution specifically guarantees the rights of Jordanian citizens, including the freedoms of speech and
press, association, academic freedom, political parties, freedom of religion, subject to “the provisions” or
“limits” of the law, which has meant in practice that freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution are
implemented in a more relative manner. A national dialogue has opened on key political reforms and anti-

3

corruption measures, including new laws to enable diversity of political parties, elections and greater local
participation and voice in matters of resource allocation. Issues receiving attention include oversight or
accountability, the judicial process, guarantees of free speech, press, and association, and instances of
discrimination based on gender and origin.
14.
Comparative international indicators, as well as casual observations, support the view that
corruption in Jordan is relatively low. Jordan ranks 37 out of 145 countries in the 2004 Transparency
International Corruption Perception Index, and is the country with less perception of corruption among all
lower middle-income and low-income countries, and fares better than some Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, such as Italy, Greece, and South Korea. However, there
is a perception among Jordanians that nepotism and connections or “wasta” can influence social and
economic opportunities in Jordan, and affect critical personnel decisions in the Civil Service. The
Government has adopted transparent hiring procedures, particularly for senior officials.
15.
Research carried out for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Governance Report1,
and the recent Jordan Public Expenditure Review showed that Jordan’s public administration
quality ranks well in relation to other countries in MENA and also compared to countries with
similar income in other parts of the world. The comparative results also indicate, though, that the
quality of Jordan’s administration has significant room for improvement to achieve a successful
transition to the more prosperous society envisaged by the leadership and expressed in such
documents as the recent National Agenda document. In the last three years, public sector reforms have
overall progressed slowly, with limited progress in punctual areas, such as e-Government, single-treasury
account, or customs, but only with marginal improvement in public expenditure management and civil
service management, where reform leadership and coordination by the key central ministries requires
more effort. The Government has, however, embarked on a very ambitious plan to re-launch its public
sector reform program. The Authorities have sought to address some of the key problems in the subnational government system, such as how to restructure the transfer system, standardize budget
formats, and train council members and staff on strategic planning. While these efforts have helped
to address some system weaknesses, fundamental structural problems persist in the sector. From a
governance perspective, power-sharing relationships between the center and local governments have not
been clearly established and, therefore, mandates and authorities overlap and responsibilities are often
confused. The decision in 2004 to introduce a regional level of local government has the potential to
strengthen local development, but will also need substantial institutional building.

II.

RECENT STRUCTURAL REFORMS: PROGRESS AMID
SETBACKS AND GOVERNMENT VOLATILITY

16.
In the last three years, reflecting a transition from the reforms of the 1990s, the country has
shifted towards more complex institutional reforms, often leading the way in the MENA region with
respect to second generation reforms. While progress overall has been good, the short life span of the
Government has slowed down progress on some of the more complex or ambitious reforms. Below is a
summary of structural reforms, key issues and the remaining agenda.

A.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION

17.
In terms of human development, Jordan is above average globally with respect to lower
middle-income countries. These positive results are based on consistent levels of spending—more than
25 percent of GDP—on human development (education, health, pensions, social safety nets). Public

provision dominates at 17 percent of GDP. In Addition, Jordan ensures a high level of gender parity in
access to basic public services. In Education, the Government launched in 2003 a comprehensive cuttingedge modernization program, aimed at radically overhauling the basic education system to align with the
needs of a knowledge-based economy. School enrollment rates at each level of education are close to
other countries at Jordan’s income level. In terms of quality, Jordan ranks above international averages in
science, but still below average in math. Population pressures and increasing income levels are placing
demands for further expansion of education and health services. The key issues and remaining agenda
concern continuing and expanding reforms for better access to higher quality education to match skills for
productive jobs created for a competitive economy.

B.

ENERGY

18.
On the whole, the energy sector of Jordan has performed relatively well, following the
implementation of the Government’s energy sector reform agenda started in 1995. Significant
institutional modernization has been achieved, especially in the electric power sub-sector, because of the
strong commitment of the Government, making Jordan a leader in energy sector reform in the region. The
power sector has started a major shift toward natural gas use, following the thirty-year Gas Purchase
Agreement with Egypt of 2001. Conversion of the Aqaba power plant to natural gas in 2003, Rehab and
Samra power plants in early 2006, means that today, around 70 percent of Jordan’s net installed capacity
is relying on natural gas, and this trend is projected to increase in the future.
19.
The Government is addressing the main weakness of the energy system, namely the highly
subsidized pricing of energy products, which is shielding consumers (including the electricity
sector) from the volatility of international oil prices, and proving totally unsustainable for the
budget given the current international prices. The end of the Iraqi oil grant and the recent sharp rise in
oil prices has increased the value of fuel imports: crude oil (64 percent) and crude oil and oil products (57
percent) in 2004, and crude oil (58 percent) and crude oil and oil products and gas (54 percent) in 2005.
For these reasons, the management of the energy sector in the years to come will be critical to Jordan’s
overall economic prospects. The Government has decided to remove all fuel subsidies by 2007.
Challenges are to design and take efficient compensatory measures for those most affected by the
subsidy removal. The policy has started to be implemented with increases of petroleum product prices
once in 2003 and twice in 2005 (an additional increase is scheduled for April 2006).

C.

GENDER

20.
Jordanian women benefited extensively from the Government’s equitable gender policies in
education and health but setbacks have also occurred. Jordan has achieved 90 percent parity in
literacy, full parity in primary and secondary enrollment, and increased life expectancy for both sexes.
Gender mainstreaming is proceeding in the National Agenda action plans. Women have also benefited
from the strong development of microfinance in Jordan over the last few years, whereby, women
borrowers amounted to 57.4 percent of clients served by the 4 major local microfinance institutions in
2004. Still, female labor force participation is low and women’s unemployment rates are significantly
higher than men’s. In addition, there is little information about access of poor and vulnerable women to
public services especially in remote and rural areas. Setbacks have also occurred. In 2001, women
activists, NGOs, and civil society joined together and drafted amendments to laws that were regarded as
compromising to women’s rights. Despite gaining government approval, the proposed temporary laws
enhancing women’s rights and protection were turned down in 2003 when the Lower House of Parliament
voted against three of the amendments.

D.

WATER

21.
The performance of Jordan’s water sector has seen significant progress through efforts to
improve the operational efficiency of both water supply and irrigation sub-sectors. However, the

5

severe scarcity of water in the country dictates a more comprehensive and pro-active approach for
sector reform, taking into account not only conservation, but also socio-economic factors. The
Ministry of Water and Irrigation has been trying to address the country water issues, and the reform
performance of Jordan is comparatively good. Jordan is one of the ten most water-poor countries in the
world, already running at a water deficit of 500 million cubic meters per year, with a disproportionate
share of available water (62.5 percent) going to agriculture which accounts for only 2.1 percent of GDP.
Thus, the challenges are daunting. In order to augment the country’s water resources, recent major
investments in capital improvements have both increased the supply of bulk water and enhanced the
wastewater treatment capacity. The Government is also working to invest in expensive non-renewable
sources (e.g. Disi-Amman transfer). The capital expenditure and financing cost of the project will cause
significant financial strain.
22.
As large and costly investments are made to increase supply, a holistic strategy and action
agenda is required, including demand management of the existing resources. Low water prices have
not encouraged efficient irrigation methods and agriculture still absorbs the largest share of available
water. Investment in water-use-efficient irrigation technology requires a broad transition towards highvalue-added agriculture, targeting high-price export and domestic markets.

E.

ENVIRONMENT

During the last three years, Jordan made substantial efforts in strengthening its
23.
environmental institutions by establishing a Ministry of Environment, and in enacting an
environmental protection law and environment impact assessment (EIA) regulations. However,
more progress is needed to consolidate the institutional setup for environmental management, particularly
on EIA and pollution management (monitoring, enforcement). In addition, management of solid waste
consumes increasing public resources and requires both a comprehensive strategy and innovative
approaches.

The financial sector is dominated by the banking system, which is nearly entirely privately
owned. Credit to the private sector is approximately 77 percent of total credit, among the highest in the
region. Interest rate spreads remain relatively high, however, and most commercial loans are short-term or
trade-based. Although the number of private banks operating in the Jordanian market would indicate

among retail lenders acting steadily to improve

finance and thus housing more affordable to Jordanian households.

25.
In recent years, the Central Bank has strengthened banking supervision, now considered to
be of a relatively high standard. It has been active in addressing issues related to non-performing loans
and selected banking cases of undercapitalization. Overall, the capital market including new financial
instruments needs to be much further developed to keep pace with the increasing sophistication of private
sector needs. Efforts are needed to intermediate available liquidity to productive investments. In
particular, more sophisticated instruments are needed: better leasing mechanisms, better credit standards
and a legal and institutional basis for modern securitization. The domestic bond market in particular is not
yet well developed, constraining the volume of funds that can be mobilized internally, and making
government borrowing more expensive. Early emphasis also needs to be focused on preparing for
securitization and on the deepening and expansion of the mortgage market. Further attention also needs to
be given to microfinance, as identified by the Government's National Strategy for Microfinance
Development, as a priority to be aimed at poverty reduction. Well structured microfinance programs are
currently active in urban areas, though not in rural areas, where experience in the past has been more
problematic.

G.

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

Structural reforms of the last decade have liberalized the private investment regime, opened
26.
the trade regime, and established modern regulation and institutions for the private sector
development and privatization. To complement these structural reforms, Jordan has entered free trade
agreements (FTA), the EU Association Agreement (EU-AA), the Greater Arab Free Trade Area
(GAFTA), and the US FTA, giving Jordan free access to a market of almost one billion people. Despite
the significant structural reforms and open access to markets, the job-creating private sector response has
been weak. The indicators of Doing Business of the last two-three years show that Jordan, while
performing slightly above regional averages, it is far from being top of the class in MENA, and compares
less favorably with some of the most dynamic emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. Progress
requires three inter-linked actions: (i) a coherent overarching investment and trade policy with a
correspondingly effective legal and institutional framework; (ii) an effective, unified institutional
structure for private sector support in contrast to the plethora of agencies that now deal with the private
sector; and (iii) reforms in some critical aspects of financial, capital and labor markets.
27.
Jordan has achieved good results in privatization, but private sector participation in
infrastructure has been overall disappointing. Cumulated privatization receipts reached above 13
percent of annual GDP, and above 10,000 new direct and indirect job opportunities were created owing to
privatization and opening up the sectors to private investments, in particular in telecoms. In contrast, a
recent review by the World Bank of the Public Private Investment (PPI) experience in Jordan shows
inconsistent results, while suggesting that some of the reasons are a lack of an overall policy for private
participation, lack of incentives in the Government’s expenditure management and procurement
processes, inabilities to address in a satisfactory way the issue of subsidies, shallow capital markets and
risk mitigation instruments, and lack of transactional capacity.

H.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

28.
Reform in the Telecommunications and in the Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) sectors in Jordan has been dynamic in the last few years, and will continue to drive the
growth of the ICT services sector. The 2004-2007 National Strategic Plan for the ICT and postal
sectors provided the basis for inter alia the introduction in 2005 of the full liberalization of fixed
telephony, a fourth mobile operator, and the successful privatization of Jordan Telecom. The success of
the telecommunications reform demonstrates that the private sector is ready to invest when the
Government provides stable policies. This is expected to translate into the creation of 20,000 direct jobs
by end-2006 (from 8,200 at end-2003), and positive impacts in terms of revenues and exports of ICT
services, as well as in support of the Government's strategic programs in "education for the knowledge
economy" and e-government. The main issues faced by the Government today in the telecommunications

7

sector relate to Internet access (low PC penetration, high Internet prices) which calls for further
liberalization of the international leased line and gateway segment in order to reduce the cost base of
broadband ISPs.

III. THE POVERTY AND JOBS CHALLENGE: BUILDING ON RECENT
PROGRESS
29.
The two main development challenges in Jordan are the persistent pockets of poverty and
unemployment. Achieving sustained growth with enhanced competitiveness, equitable distribution of the
gains, and better targeting of public expenditures directed at poverty reduction in the context of a tight
budget and external volatility are the challenges which will define this CAS period.

A.

POVERTY REDUCTION AND OUTLOOK

30.
Reducing poverty and improving the living standards of the population at large are key
priorities of the King and the Government. The prospects of poverty reduction up to 2010 range from
almost halving the poverty headcount from 14 to 7-8 percent of the population to a more mitigated
reduction to 11-12 percent.
31.
It is unlikely that the excess of private consumption growth over GDP growth, which was
responsible for the recent fast poverty decline, will prevail again in the next few years.
Consequently, the rate of GDP growth will be key, and Jordan’s ability to sustain 6 or 7 percent growth
will be one factor for achieving strong poverty reduction targets. As poverty is reduced further, it might
be more difficult for economic growth to benefit the remaining poor, so that it might be unlikely that a
given amount of economic growth will have the same impact on poverty reduction. This implies that the
calculated elasticity of 1.9 of the poverty headcount to economic growth for 1997-2002 might be lower in
the year to come. Fostering growth in poor areas and providing opportunities for the poor through broadbased growth will thus be important in attaining strong poverty reduction.
32.
The increase in energy prices resulting from the phasing out of government fuel subsidies, and the
second round effect thereof, will also have a significant impact on incomes and poverty, which will offset
part of the effect of GDP growth. A technical IMF report on the impact of subsidy removal estimated the
direct and indirect impact of fuel subsidies removal for the 20 percent poorest of the population at around
5 percent of total per-capita expenditure, which is almost equivalent to two years of per capita income
growth. Compensatory measures for the poorest will therefore be critical to shield the poor from this price
effects.
33.
The National Aid Fund (NAF) is the Government’s main poverty alleviation cash transfer
program. The Poverty Assessment showed that the NAF did reduce poverty by 0.8 percentage points, but
inadequate targeting means that about two-thirds of its hand-outs went to people above the national
poverty line. Also, the way the NAF handouts are currently designed create a disincentive towards
accepting low-paid jobs. The relevance of these issues was confirmed by grassroots Non-Government
Organizations (NGOs) representatives during the CAS consultations. Increasing the efficiency of the
NAF through better targeting could potentially help reduce poverty, especially among the 4 percent of
chronically poor who are less able to participate in the market economy.
34.
The Bank’s Poverty Assessment indicates that the third and fourth deciles of the population above
the lower poverty line have an average per capita consumption which is 20 and 44 percent higher than the
poverty line, respectively. Poverty reduction in Jordan, therefore, also means creating durable projects of
economic and social improvement for the large vulnerable share of the population, and making the

8

country resilient to the kind of economic shocks that could bring back a large group of the population
under extreme poverty.

B.

UNEMPLOYMENT OUTLOOK

35.
Labor force growth in Jordan is still at around 4 percent per year, which implies, with the
current labor demand elasticity, a growth rate of at least 6 percent to absorb new entrants to the
labor market. The projections are complicated by two additional factors: (i) the participation rate of
women is fairly low, and is subject to sharp variations; and (ii) the impact of large labor migration flows
inwards and outwards. On the former factor, there is evidence from the QIZs that women move directly
from being inactive to direct employment, so that the unemployment rate is not affected. On the later
factor, large immigration of unskilled workers also means that GDP growth rates might not result in the
projected reduction in unemployment. Overall, given the projected GDP growth rates, the unemployment
rate is likely to stay stable or to slightly increase over this CAS period. However, employment creation
should be strong and cover most of the new entrants in the labor force.
36.
The Poverty Assessment estimates that, although poverty incidence is significantly higher
among unemployed, around 75 percent of the working age poor are employed. This implies that job
creation is not by itself the ultimate solution to reducing poverty. There is a need to equip the working
poor for higher productivity jobs, and to design job-friendly income supplement for them.

C.

SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH ENHANCED COMPETITIVENESS

37.
Maintaining economic growth at around 5-7 percent over the next four years could bring
down, other things being equal, the poverty headcount by an additional 2-3 percentage points.
Economic growth above 6 percent per year is also necessary to reduce unemployment.
38.
The sources of growth of the Jordanian economy are likely to come from manufacturing
exports to world markets and from service exports to regional markets. The EU-AA and the FTA
with the US will open large and deep markets to Jordanian exporters. Jordan has the opportunity to
penetrate a large number of small niches, which, given the size of those economies, will provide large
export markets. However, given the unpredictable nature of future lucrative industrial niches, it might not
be productive to rigidly target incentives to specific sectors. In the service sectors, Jordan has clear assets
in tourism and has an edge in medical services and private provision of higher education. In tourism, the
variety of attractions would enable the marketing of Jordan as a self-standing package destination. In the
ICT sector, in addition to activities aiming at increasing Internet penetration, the National Strategic Plan
emphasizes the importance of Information Technologies and Business Process Outsourcing (respectively
ITO and BPO), and the international call center industry as means to increase exports and foreign direct
investments. These new axes together with a liberalized market have the potential to accelerate sector
growth, but substantial investments made possible by an improved investment climate and an enabling
legal and regulatory framework, are needed to consolidate those trends.
While pursuing policies to expand its skill base and improve its investment environment,
39.
Jordan will also have to continue to deepen policy reforms in a number of areas where it has
already achieved significant progress. Strengthening the skill base in a way that is flexible and
responsive to unknown market demands will be key for Jordan’s manufacturing sector. Also key will be
to improve the business climate in Jordan both for local and international investors. In addition, the
country needs to continue strengthening macro stability through lower public debt and more flexible
expenditure patterns. In particular, the fiscal situation will require further action both on the revenue and
expenditure sides. It is important that expenditure reduction be made within a clear strategic framework
that preserves social and investment expenditures.

9

40.
The considerably serious water scarcity of Jordan poses a significant threat to the country’s
long-term economic growth prospects. A buoyant economic growth across all sectors would create even
greater stress on limited resources. Ensuring water sustainability, consistently with the country’s
economic development patterns, will be an important signal to investors.

D.

TARGETING PUBLIC EXPENDITURES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

41.
The apparent inability to improve the social conditions of some segments of the population,
in the face of otherwise widespread access to basic services, seems to indicate that the current
service delivery mechanisms, while working well for the majority of Jordanians, are unable to
reach the remaining poor and excluded people. Social policy should consider some of the following
options: (i) introduce more innovative targeting mechanisms in the key programs focusing on the poor
and on special needs categories, such as the disabled, the uninsured, etc.; (ii) strengthen decentralization
and deconcentration in the delivery of certain public services; and (iii) introduce more flexible and locally
adapted public delivery systems, such as those founded on community-based development.

IV.

A.

THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: AN
AMBITIOUS VISION TO ACHIEVE A QUANTUM LEAP IN
DEVELOPMENT

LONG-TERM VISION

42.
Transforming Jordan from a lower-middle income country into a modern knowledge-based
economy with higher value, increased productivity and employment is at the core of King Adballah II’s
long-term development vision. This vision implies a bold modernization of the country’s economic,
institutional and political infrastructure, based on the enhancement of its human capital, and the
amelioration of poverty. Education, improving the business environment, and attacking deep poverty are
at the center of this vision, and the Government is well aware that this requires a modern and efficient
administration, and a more open and participative polity.

B.

NATIONAL AGENDA AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES

43.
The King has asked a broad-based Commission to put forth an integrated ten-year development
platform, called the National Agenda. The National Agenda was completed and presented to the King in
late 2005, and covers all the main development areas under eight themes. It contains broad strategies,
policies and quantifiable objectives in an integrated way, which will provide general guideline actions for
the Government in the years to come. Its main objective is to increase the welfare for all Jordanians. It
targets a doubling of income per-capita over the next ten years. The National Agenda also include a
number of Key Performance indicators to measure its implementation, which should be used for
monitoring and evaluating the Government’s action, through the Government Performance unit set up in
the Prime Minister’s Office. The National Agenda has been a main the guiding framework for this CAS,
in particular its results framework.
44.
The new Government that was formed in November 2005 has indicated its intention to start
implementing the National Agenda, and has set up the necessary administrative mechanisms in this
regards. The new Government’s program presented to Parliament runs along many of the same lines of
the National Agenda, in particular expanding freedoms and participation in society by pushing through
political reforms at the national and local level, removing remaining gender discrimination, and
enhancing the independence and fairness of the judiciary (new anti-corruption, financial disclosure and
Ombudsman’s Bureau laws). Continuing education reform, and fighting poverty and unemployment are
the top development priorities of the Government.

10

C.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
(i)

Macroeconomic Policy

The external economic shocks that hit Jordan after 2003—the drop in external grants and the rise
45.
in oil prices generated large twin deficits in fiscal and current account. The increase of oil prices by the
Government in July and September 2005 (an additional increase is scheduled for April 2006) and further
planned increases are necessary. The budget deficit before grants still remained high at 10 percent of GDP
(5.5 percent after grants) in 2005. Large privatization proceeds are expected in 2006, but their use is
restricted by law to prevent financing of the deficit. On the external front, considerable tensions on the
balance of payments are expected. The current account deficit climbed to 17.7 percent of GDP in 2005
from a small deficit in 2004; and it is expected to remain high in the next two years.
46.
The Government considers that medium-term adjustment is critical, both on the fiscal side to
ensure reduction of the government deficit, and on the structural side to support strong exports and FDI
revenues to finance the balance of payments. At the same time, the Authorities plan to maintain a
sustainable annual real growth rate of at least 5 percent with the objective of 6 percent or more to sustain
job creation and poverty reduction. To this effect, the Authorities intend economic policy to smooth the
short-term transition through flexible and consistent financing strategies on domestic and external debt.
47.
The fiscal stance of the Government entails a continued gradual reduction in the share of public
debt in GDP, on the assumption that real GDP growth will stay on average at 5-5.5 percent per year. The
Government is keenly aware of the importance of keeping a credible debt–reduction strategy, as a key
element of improving the attractiveness of Jordan as a stable investment destination. This requires a
reduction in current expenditures by more than 9 points of GDP over four years, including through
abolishing fuel subsidies, putting greater emphasis on investment spending, and strengthening revenue
performance. Under this fiscal stance, the budget will still require much higher financing, first due to the
projected decrease in foreign grants and then due to the rollover of a larger shorter maturity domestic
debt. Deepening the domestic debt market, by developing longer-maturity instruments, and securing a
sufficient level of external borrowing, appear critical to achieving a macro-economically stable financing.
World Bank lending (including budget support as needed) could help in this regards.
48.
On the external front, the current account deficit is projected to remain high in the next two years
at around 14-16 percent of GDP, before decreasing to around 6.1 percent of GDP in 2010. Critical to the
medium-term external adjustment is a sustained export performance, and the ability to attract substantial
amounts of Foreign Direct Investment. The privatization program is expected to generate large investment
inflows in 2006, which will cushion the trade shock. Looking forward, the Authorities expect large capital
inflows—particularly in the form of foreign direct investment, which increased by 50 percent in 2004 and
more than doubled in 2005—to continue, providing non-debt creating financing. Jordan will likely have
to step up its external borrowing if these expectations do not fully realize. Although there has been some
decrease in external reserves in 2005 compared to 2004, the Authorities consider maintaining an adequate
level of external reserves a key element of their macroeconomic framework. The following table presents
key macro-fiscal variables under the base case scenario, incorporating the Government’s medium-term
fiscal adjustment plan and expected evolution of some key macroeconomic parameters over the period
ahead, barring any external shocks.

Outlook and Risks

49.
The economic outlook of Jordan is characterized by a high level of uncertainty, related to
the evolution of world oil prices, the level of foreign grants, the regional security situation, the flows
of short-term external capital, and the impact of the Multi-Fiber Agreement removal on Jordanian
exports. Economic policy will have to be agile to adapt to the evolving situation.
The Government’s macro policy represents a narrow path between the objective of
50.
maintaining growth and of minimizing significant macroeconomic risks. As noted in paragraphs 4-9
above, Jordan’s recent growth performance has been broad based, spurred by structural reforms and fiscal
consolidation efforts to date, as well as private capital inflows and optimism of private investors about the
country’s economic outlook, despite external shocks and complicated regional environment. Sustaining
the growth momentum in the near future, in the face of tightening fiscal and monetary policy, and
continued regional uncertainty will undoubtedly be a challenge, and will require a credible medium-term
fiscal stance, coupled with greater efforts to preserve economic competitiveness. On the other hand,
managing the financial risks, in particular the financing of the current account deficit under the fixed peg
regime, will require a high level of adaptability of the government policy instruments in face of the
effective evolution of private capital inflows. This will require a much increased effort to build
financial management capacity in the Government. The IMF’s advice has been that expeditious efforts
to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances, including additional fiscal consolidation measures beyond 2006,
as necessary, coupled with greater efforts to preserve economic competitiveness would allow for a more
sustainable policy stance, which would reduce some of the risks associated with the Government’s macro
policies
51.
The resilience of economic growth at a level around 5 percent in 2006-08, as envisaged by
the Government, will need to be monitored. In particular, the Government will have to watch
carefully that the adopted fiscal stance and the financing mix do not put undue pressure on
domestic interest rates and inflation. While the base case projection incorporates expected slowdown
linked to the impact of higher interest rates, higher fuel prices, it also assumes relatively gradual fiscal
consolidation, continued strong exports performance, and good progress with implementation of key
social and economic reforms, which, combined, will provide reasonable economic dynamism. On the
downside, however, the rise in fuel price has started having an inflationary impact, which, if added to

12

surging government internal borrowing and raising domestic interest rates, can potentially lead to an
increase in short-term capital inflows and fuel a vicious circle of low growth, exchange rate appreciation,
pushing slowly the country into an unsustainable external situation. In the event of surging interest rates,
the Government will have to consider whether to adjust its fiscal or monetary polices, even though this
could have, in the short term, negative impact on economic growth, or review the budget financing mix to
relieve pressures on the domestic financial markets.

The realization of a high level of capital inflows in the medium-term is critical to the
viability of the government’s policy stance. A key underlying element of this strategy is continued

52.

large capital inflows in the medium-term, including significant privatization receipts in 2006. The
government expects that given the high liquidity in the region, the continued solid macroeconomic
management and further efforts to improve the investment climate will help maintain the recent high level
of capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investments. The regional security situation and the inherent
volatility of capital flows entails a degree of uncertainty in this regard, making management of
macroeconomic imbalances, especially the external current account, more challenging over the mediumterm. This risk and its implications for financial stability and sustainability of the growth momentum are
recognized by the Government. A greater emphasis on developing risk mitigating polices, in particular,
planning more flexible financing policies, will need to complement the Government’s policy of pursuing
further macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms to increase productivity and competitiveness of
the economy. A greater coordination of the fiscal and monetary polices and vigilant debt management,
particularly as the government plans to increasingly access the domestic capital markets, are equally
important. As discussed in paragraph 47 above and paragraph 54 below, deepening the domestic debt
market and securing a sufficient level of concessional external borrowing are critical in this respect while
still being consistent with a reduction of Jordan’s external debt both in absolute number and as a ratio to
GDP.
(iii)

Country Financing Strategy

53.
The National Debt Law in Jordan stipulates that government debt not exceed 80 percent of
GDP by the end of 2006, and that external debt drop below 60 percent of GDP by the same date.
Concomitantly, the Government rightly wants to further tap the domestic financial market to finance and
re-finance their government debt, with a view to reducing the country’s macro-economic vulnerability.
The projected reduction in total foreign grants, however, implies that the Government’s overall financing
requirements are likely to increase compared to the average levels in 2003-2005.
54.
Financing will come primarily from internal borrowing, although, given the tightening of
monetary policy and the need to reduce pressure on domestic interest rate and maintain foreign
reserves, external financing will still have to play an important role in the years to come, though
maybe not as important as during the 1999-2002 period. The external financing will have to be
obtained through borrowing from multilateral agencies and bilateral donors, but also by accessing
international capital markets. The level of external borrowing will still be consistent with a reduction of
Jordan’s external debt both in absolute number and as a ratio to GDP.
55.
Given the large amount of domestic borrowing envisaged, proactive debt management is
key. The efficiency and depth of the domestic sovereign market can rapidly improve, if specific
regulatory and technical reforms are taken, in particular: (i) introduce four-five standard maturities to
establish a good yield curve, make issuance more transparent, and build liquidity; (ii) stimulate
competition, expand the domestic investor base with non-bank financial institutions and foreign banks;
and (iii) facilitate the shortage of repos.

BANK SUPPORT AND STRATEGIC ISSUES

LAST CAS PERFORMANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED

56.
The CAS Completion Report assessed the implementation of the Bank’s FY2003-2005
country assistance strategy as moderately satisfactory. The CAS program, essentially a follow-on of
two earlier CASes, reflected a good understanding of the national challenges and was relevant to,
and aligned with the Government’s long-term development goals spelled out in the Social and
Economic Transformation Plan, and much of the AAA and technical assistance was internalized. Its
implementation, however, was somewhat less satisfactory. The CAS program was not sufficiently
selective, and due to the availability of grant aid from donors (uncertain at the time of the CAS
preparation) overestimated Jordan’s financing needs, and Jordan’s ability to carry out Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs).
•

•

•

•

57.

Important successes were registered in areas where the Government’s commitment to
reforms was the strongest. The Government sought Bank’s assistance on key policy issues and
requested critical lending in specific areas, where the Bank was able to assist the Government in
developing a clear, country-owned integrated policy framework financed by various
partners and accompany the Government’s reform efforts over a long period of time while
enhancing substantially the institutional development aspects of its activities: education (PESW
and lending), pension reform (TA), poverty assessment (ESW), privatization (TA), public
expenditure (ESW), and one of the major infrastructure and development project around the
capital city–Amman Development Corridor (lending). Those activities will continue under the
new CAS to provide continued support to the implementation of the reform programs.
However, on the AAA side, several activities were prepared in silos, addressing issues that are
cross-sectoral in nature, within the narrow perspective of a single sector. This limited their
impact. In addition, small unplanned-for-tasks were added over the years. This demonstrated the
responsiveness of the Bank to Government’s requests but deprived the program of overall
coherence. The results of most AAA work were not disseminated beyond the Bank’s primary
interlocutors in the Government and, therefore, failed to generate debate or lead to a wide
stakeholder ownership.
Three critical projects positioned at the core of the Government’s reform effort were approved.
However, lending came to only US$173 million from the US$455 million planned. Out of six
operations planned, three were not delivered – the two planned guarantees and the adjustment
lending did not materialize. This is due to two factors: availability of grant aid which rendered the
adjustment lending unnecessary and Jordan’s inability to carry out the PPPs envisaged.
In the water sector, the Bank was unable to reach an agreement with the Government on the
coverage of the PESW which was expected to provide an integrated, cross-sector, and holistic
approach to water.
The experience offers important lessons to guide the new CAS:

•

•

More realistically estimate the financing needs of the country in determining the lending
envelope, including better use of partnership with the other donors in determining the levels of
grants they are likely to provide. However, given the uncertain nature of future grant aid, the
Bank will need to remain flexible in assessing the lending envelope and seek to replicate the
successes of the Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy (ERfKE) and Amman
Development Corridor projects by assisting the preparation of sector-wide strategies and
policy frameworks whose implementation donors can finance with or without Bank financing.
Ensure that the activities in the program are prepared and implemented using a cluster
approach to ensure flexibility to respond to the demand, a better ability to conduct complex
cross-sectoral AAA, and the complementarity of findings and recommendations. To

14

maximize development impact, Bank assistance needs to emphasize selectivity. Given the limited
Bank staff resources available, the Bank should limit its engagement to a few areas and sectors
and support these continuously over time.
Adopt a cross-sectoral approach to water issues. Given the acuteness of the problem facing
Jordan, continue to press the Government on taking a holistic approach to water.
Assist the Government in implementing the recommendations of the Bank’s report on
Public-Private Partnerships in Jordan to remove obstacles to PPI. Jordan’s infrastructure needs
are huge and the fiscal space is tight. Thus it is crucial for the Government to attract as much
private investment in infrastructure and service delivery as possible. IFC is giving special
attention to PPI in its privatization advisory program in Jordan.
Improve the impact of policy recommendations in the Bank’s ESW. Future AAA will need to
involve a wider group of stakeholders both in the preparation and dissemination of AAA to build
a constituency for reform through communications and outreach.
Ensure full collaboration between IBRD, IFC, and MIGA on private sector development advisory
and technical assistance activities.

CURRENT PORTFOLIO

58.
Historically, Jordan has maintained good portfolio performance. Strong ownership of the
projects by the country and the generally good project implementation capacity of Jordanian
institutions have been the main factors behind the portfolio’s success.
59.
Jordan's portfolio consists of six active
IBRD projects, one Global Environment
Facility (GEF) Grant, and one Montreal
Protocol for a total of US$278 million. Education
accounts for 56 percent of the portfolio, public
sector reform for 5 percent, water 20 percent,
transport 14 percent, environment 4 percent and
rural development 2 percent. Overall performance
of the portfolio both from the perspective of
implementation and development impact is good.
All projects are expected to achieve their
objectives, albeit some requiring an extension of
the closing date.

60.
All indicators of portfolio management continue to be strong, and no change in the
supervision strategy is envisaged at this time. The disbursement ratio during the FY03-05 CAS period
averaged 23 percent, well above MENA’s average of 15.5 percent and in line with the Bank’s average of
21.3 percent. No project is currently at risk. OED project ratings in terms of outcome, sustainability and
institutional development impact of Jordan’s closed projects have been high relative to all projects Bankwide and to other countries in MENA. This includes both adjustment and investment projects. During the
last CAS OED undertook four project evaluations. Three projects were rated satisfactory and one
moderately satisfactory. All the projects that have closed during the last CAS or are scheduled to close
during FY06 required on average an extension of 18 months. Overly ambitious project timetables are
generally considered to be the main reason for the delays. The largest project in the portfolio will continue
to be managed by staff located in the Bank’s Lebanon Country Office which allows for proactive and
flexible supervision.
61.
Jordan has one of the largest grant portfolios in the MENA region. The implementation of
the Grants has been generally satisfactory, but the disbursement rate is generally slower than that of the
projects. During the CAS implementation period eight Trust Funds were approved. While the grants have
achieved or are expected to achieve their objectives, fragmentation increases the risk of unsustainability

15

which puts a heavy burden on the Bank’s already stressed Country Budget. Over the next CAS period, the
Bank and the Government are expected to continue to strategically use Trust Funds to support the four
clusters while attempting to be more selective to ensure the sustainability of all the grants.

C.

NEW BUSINESS CONTEXT AND STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

62.
The business environment for the Bank in Jordan is at a turning point: Jordan is becoming
more of a typical middle-income borrower. Higher growth, stronger local capacity, a more open and
vocal political scene, the presence of large grant donors on the lending side and of large consultancy firms
on the AAA side, suggest a reorientation from the past business-as-usual approach.
63.

Changing conditions imply:
•
•
•
•
•

D.

Less fragmented interventions, tightly focused around core Government priorities to
leverage the Bank’s competitive edge in institutional reforms and innovative approaches, as
opposed to multiple tasks that respond to idiosyncratic internal or external demands;
More cross-sectoral work and pooling together the activities of the different parts of the
World Bank Group to respond to more sophisticated client requirements;
Clear, country-owned policy frameworks before entering into new initiatives;
Better communication, image and outreach to support a better public understanding of the
Bank’s role in the policy field; and
More flexible instruments to respond to volatility and changing political direction, including
more flexible financial instruments, and some quick-response unallocated TA capability.

CIVIL SOCIETY CONSULTATIONS

64.
The Bank, in full coordination with the Government, held as series of consultations with
different segments of the civil society in Jordan. The consultations included one seminar with leading
opinion leaders invited by the Center of Public Policy in Amman, two consultations with private and
financial sector representatives, and a series of regional consultations with grassroots Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) that culminated with a half-day seminar in Amman with the Bank CAS team.
These consultations were intended to inform the Bank team analysis, and identify issues that are of
particular importance to a wide range of stakeholders. Some key suggestions have been incorporated in
the analysis. A summary of issues discussed is included in CAS Annex III.

E.

DONOR SUPPORT

65.
Because of its strategic regional role, and its good development outcomes, Jordan‘s
development program has benefited from large foreign aid support. Most bilateral and multilateral
development agencies have an active presence in Jordan, with the United States, European Union and
Japan being the largest contributors. This extensive support has given the Government choices in
selecting the most appropriate assistance. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation has
been effective in ensuring coordination at the strategic level. This process could be further strengthened
by better integration of donors’ funds with the domestic budget process. Donors have established a
donors/lenders group, with secretarial support from United Nations Development Programme and a
rotating chair arrangement, which has also helped in sharing information more regularly.
66.
However, in certain cases of weak or fragmented institutional responsibilities, a lack of
coherent sector strategies and operational coordination has often resulted in fragmented donor
assistance, activities within inappropriate policy or institutional frameworks, weak ability to select
and scale up successes, and ultimately little on-the-ground impact. This appears to have been the case
for instance in the areas of private sector development, social protection, and financial management
reform. In contrast, the experience of the education program has been a good example of donors’

16

coordination at both the strategic and operational level through leadership by the Ministries of Education
and Planning and International Cooperation. During consultations with the existing donors/lenders
coordination group, the issues were openly acknowledged and the group was willing to pursue them with
the Government as part of its upcoming coordination agenda.
67.

The Bank’s comparative advantage is based on three factors:
y
y
y

the AAA’s program’s ability to diagnose issues and design sector strategies;
international experience that can be brought to bear on policy-makers; and
the financial resources of loans, grants, guarantees and private sector investments to
catalyze, leverage and replicate development activities.

68.
Donor assistance in the years to come will be both complementary and alternative to the
World Bank program. The focus of the US development support is private sector development, water,
health and governance; the EU’s development support is focused on public sector reform, private and
financial sector development and employment policy; Japan’s main focus areas are water, environment,
health and vocational training. The UN Development Assistance Framework for the period 2003-2007
sets two key priorities: the development of national capacity to promote and implement human
development approaches, and support of good governance and public sector reform. CAS Annex II shows
indicatively the main areas of intervention of the various donors for the years to come.

F.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

69.
The Bank Group Assistance Program will support the Government’s overarching
objectives of poverty reduction and productive jobs creation. The specific activities of support will be
clustered around four pillars to maximize impact, enhance synergy, increase the efficiency of Bank
support, while avoiding fragmentation and provide agility over the CAS period. The activities will be
chosen in accordance with each cluster’s strategic objectives. Not every activity in the program described
in Table 2 will necessarily go forward and activities not now contemplated may be added. However, both
flexibility and selectivity will be achieved through use of a results framework that specifies desired
outcomes and defines intermediate indicators.
70.

The four clusters are:
•
•
•
•

Productive job creation through strengthening the investment environment and human resources
for a skill-intensive and knowledge-based economy;
Local development through increased access to services and economic opportunities;
Social protection and expanding inclusion; and
Public expenditures’ restructuring and public sector reform.

71.
The four programmatic clusters are directly aligned with the poverty reduction and job
creation objectives of the Government. The first two clusters tackle issues related to private investment
and job creation, respectively at the macro level and at the local/grassroots level. The third cluster deals
with programs to achieve acceptable and sufficient welfare through market mechanisms. The last cluster
is focused on the supporting improvements in the government budget and the administration. The clusters
are designed to ensure tangible and monitorable impact of the Bank’s program in supporting
comprehensively the Government’s poverty-reduction and job creation objectives. Some “horizontal”
issues, such as gender or the environment, will be mainstreamed into the clusters.
72.
The CAS framework is intended to be sufficiently flexible to respond to evolving government
priorities and needs, leaving scope for dialogue to appropriately design future investment and
development policy lending operations in line with the overarching objectives and within the four
clusters. The CAS does not provide an exhaustive list of Bank Group activities for the next four years.

17

Internal and external developments, progress in the implementation of the reform agenda, political,
economic, and social developments that are not entirely foreseeable will influence specific opportunities.
Therefore, flexibility in the selection of specific operations within the three scenarios is essential to
achieve results through different mixes of support. Selection of the Bank lending intervention during the
second part of the CAS implementation will be decided during the preparation of the mid-term CAS

Progress Report.
CAS Cluster 1: Strengthening the Investment Environment and Building Human Resources
for a Value-Added, Skill-Intensive and Knowledge-Based Economy

73.
The objective of this Cluster is to help the Government implement its strategy to generate
private sector jobs. The achievements of the outcomes under this cluster will be measured by progress in
the non-residential investment rate, in overall job creation, and in the quality of education. Intermediary
benchmarks for the Bank’s contribution to these objectives will be closely aligned with the content of the
4 mentioned strategic areas of Bank activity in this cluster.
74.
Policy Issues: A small open economy with a strategic location in the Middle East, Jordan’s
economic growth depends on the ability of private sector firms to competitively access regional and
international markets. This will require both a very attractive business environment to spur local and
foreign investment, as well as building a strong competitiveness based on the excellence of the Jordanian
labor force. Beyond the prevailing security situation in the region, such prospects are today limited by:
(i) remaining vulnerabilities of the fiscal situation, notwithstanding the improvement of the last decade;
(ii) continued high-levels of red tape and remaining weaknesses in Government service delivery as
evidenced in the Cost of Doing Business Indicators; (iii) a number of other weaknesses in capital markets,
infrastructure, water and logistics; (iv) lack of alignment between various sector policies and institutions
to sustain investment; and (v) a weak link between growth and jobs, deriving from the peculiar labor
market mechanisms, where the most educated segment of the labor force leave, while large numbers of
immigrant workers take unskilled jobs in the face of high local youth unemployment.
75.
Government Policy: An emphasis on making Jordan a most attractive location for
knowledge-based private investment, in order to support job creation, is a key element of the
Government policy and National Agenda. The National Agenda places the Jordan Authority for
Enterprise Development (JAED) as an umbrella organization aimed at ensuring greater policy and
operational consistency between the numerous programs and policies directed to support the private
sector including private participation in the provision of public goods. Improving the quality of labor is
key to raising employment opportunities given Jordan’s labor as market position in the region. Thus,
education continues to be one of the top Government priorities. The Government’s policy for the next 5ten years envisions the continuation and deepening of the reforms begun under the ERfKE-I program, in
addition to new reforms. Fundamental reform of the higher education sector is also a key element of the
National Agenda. In the education sector (all stages up to secondary education including early childhood
education), the Government’s objective is to: (i) expand access to pre-primary and post-basic education,
as well as reach the poor who are being left out of basic education; (ii) improve the quality of education;
and (iii) enhance management and governance of the sector and the Ministry of Education. Finally, the
Government is aiming at strengthening the efficiency of the labor market by enhancing its links with
education, by putting in place policies to ensure that Jordanians get the jobs inside Jordan, both at the
high and low end of the skill scale, and ensuring that labor regulations are consistent with the overall
investment policy.
76.
World Bank Group Support: This cluster is the Government’s highest priority, and will be
addressed in a comprehensive manner by the World Bank Group. This will entail a mix of financial
support through Bank lending and analytical work, priority investments and technical assistance by IFC,
and guarantees by MIGA. This will involve: (i) help to operationalize a broad-based, multisectoral

18

investment strategy for the country, though both ESW and survey based analytical diagnostic; (ii) the
promotion of activities through TA or a project that can have a catalytic and sizeable effect on exports,
competitiveness and job creation; (iii) supporting the greater attractiveness of Jordan for Public Private
Partnership in all sectors of activity, but especially in the area of large infrastructure finance and
provision; and (iv) supporting enhanced quality of education and skills of the Jordanian population at all
levels, and support better linkages with the labor market.
77.
The Government’s Private Sector Development agenda is reasonably clear, however
implementation remains a major challenge and concern of the Government. This is because decision
making is difficult and needs an analytic underpinning, technical assistance is needed to support
implementation, and financial resources are needed to resolve market failures in areas like export market
development and vocational training. An example of this model can be found in the recent report on
Public Private Partnerships completed by the Bank. This analytic work supported the recent Government
decision to establish a policy and legal framework. The Bank and IFC in partnership with the EU and
USAID plan to provide the necessary technical assistance and the Bank, MIGA and IFC will address
market failures in areas such as long term infrastructure financing with lending and guarantee operations.
78.
The Banks analytic work will include a study on the labor market, an investment climate
assessment and an overall study on investment incentives. Technical assistance from the Bank will focus
on public private partnerships and privatization to stimulate investment, vocational training, and follow
on technical assistance identified by the labor market and vocational training studies. Bank lending will
focus on resolving market failures identified in the vocational training, infrastructure financing and the
private sector.
79.
IFC’s Strategy in Jordan places a high priority on seeking new investment opportunities in the
following areas: (i) promoting export-oriented and foreign exchange generating investments particularly
in manufacturing and services, (ii) encouraging private participation in Infrastructure, (iii) attracting
foreign private investments, particularly to the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZA); (iv) developing
the financial sector through promoting housing finance, microfinance, and trade finance; and (v)
contributing to improving the private provision of health and education, and support the tourism and ICT
sectors. IFC’s approach would diversify its exposure, provide long-term debt financing, and take selective
equity stakes.
80.
In addition, as a result the establishment of IFC’s regional Technical Assistance facility—the
Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP-MENA)—TA activities in Jordan has significantly increased
covering a wide range of areas that contribute to private sector development. These activities are being
strategically selected and positioned to fill gaps, complement what others are doing, respond to client
demands, and ensure effective implementation. For example, IFC is currently engaged in reviewing the
legal and regulatory framework for leasing, improving the corporate governance practices for Banks,
providing management training for SMEs, improving business regulations (e.g., inspections), and
advising the Government on the private participation for the expansion of Queen Alia International
Airport , among other activities. (see CAS Annex IV for a full account of IFC’s current and planned
activities in Jordan)
81.
MIGA Activities: MIGA's objective is to raise its business development activities in Jordan,
both for Jordanian companies and for foreign investors potentially interested in investing in
Jordan. A primary goal is to provide confidence to investors and lenders who may worry about the
political risks of investing in the region. MIGA's particular focus in Jordan will be on: (i) support for
larger-scale infrastructure, cross-border, oil and gas and mining projects; (ii) guarantees for Jordanian
investors and banks, such as Arab Bank, as they venture into other countries in the region; and
(iii) support for Jordanian companies' and banks' access to the international capital markets. MIGA's
guarantees (against the risks of transfer/inconvertibility, expropriation, breach of contract, and war, civil
disturbance, terrorism, and sabotage) can have a significant effect in large-scale infrastructure and

19

privatization projects by attracting investors and lenders who might otherwise not be willing to invest, as
well as by lengthening the tenors and reducing the interest rates associated with financing those projects.
Similarly, by assuming the Jordanian sovereign risk, MIGA's guarantees can allow Jordanian companies
going to the international capital markets to significantly exceed the (currently sub-investment grade)
sovereign ceiling of Jordan and achieve significantly higher ratings, resulting in both increased investor
interest and lower all-in financing costs. Banks can also use this program when arranging mortgagebacked securitizations or private placements in the international capital markets. In its efforts, MIGA is
working closely with the IFC's representative in Jordan, as well as with local institutions, especially the
Jordan Loan Guarantee Corp. In addition to providing guarantee products that may be requested, MIGA
will support the Jordan Investment Board and the Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority with some
TA.
CAS Cluster 2: Supporting Local Development through Increased Access to Services and

Economic Opportunities
The objective of this cluster is to support the Government’s aim of achieving regionally
82.
balanced and equitable growth. The achievement of outcomes under this cluster will be measured by
increases in access to services, employment opportunities and new private investment attracted outside
the capital Amman and the Aqaba economic zone. Intermediary indicators of Bank contribution will be
defined by adoption of specific government policy measures to promote the sustainability and financial
solvency of sub-national institutions; greater engagement of citizens, NGOs and the private sector in
participatory planning and budgetary processes; and increased financing for local investments to expand
services and exploit local economic endowments.
83.
Policy Issues: While recent indications of increased economic growth in Jordan have sent
positive signals, the benefits of growth have been concentrated mainly in the capital and a limited
number of other large cities. Outside of Jordan’s main economic growth poles, economic opportunities
have been slow to materialize, with unemployment and poverty incidence largely concentrated in the
regional periphery. Better infrastructure, urban planning, exploitation of cultural heritage assets, social
services, and land development at the local level would provide nascent manufacturing and service
industries, including tourism, small-scale manufacturing and crafts, an opportunity to invest and grow.
Capacity constraints in local planning and management, lack of financing, land use constraints, and
underutilization of public-private and NGO partnerships are currently major factors in hindering this
potential. The scarcity of natural resource endowment in many areas of Jordan also limits economic
opportunities to small micro-activities well adapted to their environment. Micro-credits appear to be the
best vehicle to potentially support this kind of grassroots development, but the current successful
development of micro-credit institutions in Jordan has until now largely avoided the rural areas. Finally,
while agriculture does not weigh heavily in contribution to GDP, it is a critical economy in some selected
areas. To be viable and sustainable over the long-term, however, it needs to shift towards more
appropriate water use and crop patterns, which are currently not supported by the structure of the water,
trade, and subsidy policies.
84.
Government Policy: As a cross-cutting theme, local development comprises a wide range of
different elements, strategies, institutions and beneficiaries. The Government’s local development
strategy does not attempt to employ or address all of them, but rather seeks to achieve an
appropriate and realistic blend of catalytic interventions that will improve the livelihoods and living
conditions for all Jordanians in an equitable manner. The Government’s strategy includes: (i)
promoting decentralization through three development regions, with locally elected councils to foster
local development initiatives closer to the citizens; (ii) strengthening municipalities by developing sound
budgeting, investment and physical planning, and financial management capacities, while enabling them
to better exploit local economic endowments, (iii) providing capital, particularly through microfinance
schemes for local investment; and (iv) undertaking a comprehensive reform of the cooperative sector that
encourages local initiative and reduces government intervention in the sector.

20

85.
Envisaged World Bank Group Support: The cluster adopts four strategic intervention strategies,
including (i) increasing local voice and participation in resource allocation and related decision-making;
(ii) developing the capacity of sub-national institutions to plan, implement and manage their development
programs; (iii) improving the sustainable use of local endowments and assets as a means of catalyzing
local economic development; and (iv) leveraging small-scale entrepreneurial initiatives through increased
access to credit and support services, as well as expanding public-private partnerships at the local level.
CAS Cluster 3: Reforming Social Protection and Expanding Inclusion
86.
The objective of this cluster is to reduce poverty through better targeted and coordinated
social services, and to extend social services to marginal groups of society who have not been
reached through mainstream provision. The achievement of outcomes in this cluster will be measured
by the reform of Jordan’s major social safety net programs, and extension of basic social services to
marginal or vulnerable groups of society.
87.
Policy Issues: Jordan today has multiple anti-poverty programs including the National Aid Fund
(NAF), the Enhanced Productivity Program (EPP), the Social and Economic Transformation Program
(SETP), the Zakat Fund, and special programs under the different ministries of social development,
agriculture, health, and others. While poverty has indeed gone down between 1997 and 2002/2003, it is
not clear whether this has been a result of the anti-poverty programs. Indeed, Jordan’s main safety net
program—the NAF—has been shown not to be well targeted (two-thirds of its transfers go people above
the National Poverty Line). Going forward, the nature of poverty (much more localized and harder to
address just by economic growth) in Jordan will command that anti-poverty programs be well-targeted,
efficient, and coordinated. Jordan also needs to worry about segments of society, such as disadvantaged
children and youth, disabled persons, other marginal poor communities, who are not being reached by
mainstream social services.
88.
As noted in paragraph 41 above, it is timely to review the spectrum of activities of social
assistance within a unified strategy, to reduce duplication, enhance targeting, expand impact, and ensure
adequate monitoring and evaluation. A key element of this strategy is a paradigmatic reform of the NAF.
A robust and strengthened safety net system can help Jordan absorb shocks that may come either from
external factors (geo-political) or from the need to undertake difficult domestic economic reforms that
have negative repercussions on the poor (such as removal of energy or other kinds of subsidies). Jordan is
ready to consider other structures of safety nets, which are more innovative and which other countries
tried successfully, such as conditional cash transfers and social/local-development funds. A key element
for any safety net program to be effective is to have good targeting—which is not the case currently in
Jordan’s safety net programs, and to be strongly aligned with government policies and market incentives
in other areas, such as in the TVET, microfinance and local development sectors, as well as with the labor
market.
89.
Government Policy: The National Agenda Committee on Social Welfare was mandated to
look at poverty, social security and healthcare. In the poverty area, the Committee concluded that there
is a need for a “national social policy” which brings all poverty alleviation programs into a coherent
framework. The Committee has adopted the target of reducing poverty from 14.4 percent in 2004, to 12
percent in 2012, and 10 percent in 2017.
90.
Among the Committee’s specific recommendations is the establishment of a “Higher
National Council for Social Development and Poverty Alleviation”, to be chaired by the Minister of
Social Development and reporting to the Prime Minister. The Council’s main function is to formulate
social policy, approve national poverty alleviation strategies, monitor the effectiveness and financing of
poverty alleviation programs, and ensure coordination among the many different ministries, agencies,
civil society organizations and NGOs working in this area. The committee also recommended that the

21

NAF be restructured and focus its objective on reaching the chronic poor (4 percent) who are not able to
work and the transient poor (11 percent) when they fall below the poverty line. Linking NAF transfers to
outcomes will also be part of the reform of the NAF). The Committee also recommended the
establishment of a unified database which would include information on all social benefit recipients and
would, therefore, reduce duplication. Improving targeting of social programs under the Ministry of Social
Development is also a main objective of the National Agenda. A major improvement in the capacity and
human resources of the Ministry of Social Development is to underpin the above changes. The Ministry
of Finance views the reform of the NAF as a priority in order to act as a cushion for the most vulnerable
parts of society in light of potential economic shocks brought about by the need to increase fuel prices.
91.
Envisaged World Bank Group Support: The Bank will support the Governments’ objective of
poverty alleviation and social protection through a combination of AAA and financial support organized
around the following strategic areas: (i) developing a comprehensive social protection and safety net
strategy which would pick up where the recently completed Poverty Assessment and the Public
Expenditure Review ended; (ii) a project to assist the Government to reform the social assistance and
social protection system, and develop robust targeting and monitoring and evaluation systems; and
(iii) other instruments to be determined such as a social/local development fund that could increase the
quality and quantity of basic services provision to the most disadvantaged areas.
CAS Cluster 4: Restructuring Public Expenditures and Supporting Public Sector Reform
92.
The objective of this cluster is to strengthen the Public Administration’s ability to design
and implement development polices, through a better-aligned pubic expenditures management
system and the enhancement of the service delivery infrastructure. The program includes support
for reforming those public institutions which underpin the structure of public expenditures,
enhancing monitoring and evaluation capacities and addressing service delivery dysfunctions.
93.
Policy Issues: A decade of fiscal adjustments has led to dramatic improvement of Jordan
overall fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The quality of public expenditure, in terms of composition
and effectiveness, has however not improved much in parallel, and effectiveness can still be further
improved. At the same time, fiscal vulnerabilities remain, and continued fiscal consolidation is needed.
Higher demand for public services, as well as the Government’s ambitious development objectives
require that the structure and quality of expenditure, as well as budgetary and financial management,
improve significantly in the next phase. This will require that the financial authorities of the country be
able to insert their fiscal concern in a longer-term expenditure restructuring strategy, rather than acting on
the basis of short-term expediencies and urgency. The restructuring of public expenditures is also
critically linked to key reforms of the institutional set up of the public sector, such as civil service
subsidy, budget management and policy making reforms. Better coordination of the donors activities in
this field is also required. Long-term fiscal challenges emerging from the pension system, or the health
sector, need also to be addressed early on.
94.
Government Policy: The Government has identified restructuring public expenditures
management as a critical priority. A comprehensive Public Sector Reform Program was approved by
the Cabinet in 2004 which covers three levels of reform. The first consists of modernizing the
organizational structure of the Ministry of Finance and strengthening its capacity to ensure more efficient
performance and capacity to manage reform initiatives. This will consist in a comprehensive review of the
ministry’s role and the legislative and administrative framework directing its work. This effort will
include probable changes in enlarging and enforcing the role of the ministry in managing public funds.
The second level consists of engaging in reform to improve the financial policy to achieve enforcement of
the financial stability and avoidance of financial crisis through more efficient allocation of available
resources according to national priorities. The third level concentrates on achieving harmonization by
encouraging forward and backward relations between the financial management reform agenda and other

22

dimensions of public sector reform. The components include policy and decision making, performance
management and service delivery, the restructuring of government institutions and human resource
management. Implementation of this agenda is underway.
95.
Potential World Bank Group Support: The Bank’s support in this area would be: (i) the
continuation of analytical and technical work on public expenditure, including financial management
capacity assessment, in a programmatic fashion throughout the duration of the CAS to ensure that overall
fiscal dialogue and selected sectoral dialogue is maintained in a consistent framework; (ii) continued
support for the necessary reforms of public institutions that underpin the structure of public expenditures,
through supervision of the Public Sector Reform-Capacity Building project (PSRCB); and (iii)
complementary policy assistance through a programmatic operation including public sector reform
elements.
Cross-Cutting Issues and Cross Sectoral Concerns
96.
A number of important sectors and thematic issues will be addressed in the CAS within the
activities of the 4 operational clusters.
97.
Water: Although the Bank will not be engaged in the water sector through a specific cluster,
some key issues in water will be reviewed as part of a Water Sector Review, within the public
expenditure review (PER) work on subsidies, particularly looking at smart subsidies for on-farm
irrigation techniques and a possible pilot OBA scheme for a small to medium sized urban center, as
well as in the work on the investment regime, where issues of water sustainability in relation to the
country’s development trends will be reviewed. The Bank stands ready to increase its involvement in
this sector, if Government is ready to move on sector reform, including tariff reform conservation,
allocation, cost recovery, and efficiency improvements.
98.
Gender: The CAS activities will focus on gender from the standpoint of creating an
environment more conducive to the higher participation of women in the labor force and
investment in the private sector. Thus removing obstacles that discriminate against the hiring of
women, addressing challenges that women face in balancing work with family duties, fostering the
development of local employment opportunities and means to income generating activities at the
grassroots are necessary. Likewise, ensuring accessibility to employment opportunities and markets
through safe means of transportation, are likely to further increase female economic activity. The analysis
of the labor market will also look at the gender dimension in unemployment and labor force participation.
99.
Environmental Issues: Environmental issues will be addressed selectively, building on their
link with local development—in particular the impact of eco-system degradation on poor populations—
and looking at the role of environmental safeguard regulations in the quality of the investment
regime. Creative applications of Carbon Finance under the Kyoto protocol’s Clean Development
Mechanism will be considered.

VI. LENDING SCENARIOS, TRIGGERS, BANK GROUP EXPOSURE,
AND RISKS
A.

LENDING ENVELOPES AND SCENARIOS

100.
The maximum lending envelope in the Base Case is US$440 million over the four-year CAS
period, i.e. an average of US$110 million a year. Investment lending is projected to be around US$240,
and the remaining US$200 million would be disbursed as budget support loans on a need basis. Another
US$100 million over four years will be available as Partial Risk Guarantees.

24

101.
In a low case scenario, defined by inappropriate fiscal and macro policies that would put undue
pressure on domestic interest rates and inflation or respond inadequately to a shortfall in private capital
inflows and that would bring Jordan on an unsustainable path, the lending envelope would shrink to
US$175 million over four years, keeping only investment projects directed to social sectors and local
development.
102.
A high case would be defined by higher sustainable growth—resulting from combination of solid
macroeconomic management, positive external circumstances, and rapid progress with structural
reforms—which could require additional technical and policy assistance and would involve additional
US$100 million in lending, both investment and budget support.
103.
IFC’s objective is to raise its overall portfolio in Jordan through selected investments in strategic
sectors (See Annex IV).

B.

TRIGGERS

104.
Given significant tensions inherent to the policy stance of the Government, linked to the
need of continued adjustment in both fiscal and external accounts, while maintaining a reasonable
level of economic growth consistent with objectives of poverty reduction and employment
generation, the Base Case is defined by a set of fiscal and macro triggers pointing to a stable macro
policy. The Base Case is also underlined by strong reform effort that will ensure that the needed structural
adjustment to policies affecting investment and exports performance and, hence, prospect for sustained
growth, are in place.
105.
The macro triggers for the Base Case are: (i) a reduction of the general government debt to GDP
ratio under 80 percent by end-2006 compared to end-2005, and a reduction by 2 percentage points every
year thereafter; (ii) central government budget deficit (before grants) be progressively reduced to below 4
percent by 2008; and (iii) foreign reserves of monetary authorities remain at adequate levels in terms of
imports of Goods and Non Factor Services (GNFS) (i.e. between 4-5 months) and providing coverage for
public sector debt service.
106.
In addition to the Base Case macro benchmarks, the high case scenario calls for significant
progress with structural reforms in social assistance and energy. In social assistance, better targeting of
social assistance programs, with leakage of NAF reduced from two thirds to less than 40 percent. In
energy, creation of a market-driven energy efficiency fund, and finalization of the legal and contractual
framework for renewable energy.

C.

BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS: CURRENT PORTFOLIO, LENDING, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,
AAA, AND COMMUNICATIONS
107.
The existing portfolio contains six projects, three of which were approved during the last
CAS period. These projects will contribute to achieve the new CAS objectives, as many of them are
directly related to the four clusters of the new CAS. The ERfKE and the Higher Education Projects will
continue to building a qualified human resources base for Jordan. The Public Sector Capacity loan will
provide critical resource to the Government to improve its effectiveness. The Third Tourism Project will
support jobs creation and income generation by increasing tourism-related employment opportunities. The
Amman Urban Corridor and the Horticultural Projects will contribute to improving the physical and
institutional basis for private sector investment.
108.
The proposed program contains tentatively two investment lending operations per year,
plus possible policy-based lending operations. Development Policy Lending (DPL) is envisaged on the
basis of likely Government budget financing requirements and balance of payments financing needs.

25

DPLs will be considered flexibly in any of the four clusters, in which case they could replace some of the
proposed sector investment lending operation with high policy content, or they could be designed across
the four clusters, and be strongly linked to the implementation of the National Agenda to underscore the
ownership of the policy program supported by the Bank policy lending. The activation of the DPLs is
directly linked to a prior stable macroeconomic situation defined by the combined realization of all the
macroeconomic Base Case triggers. This would guarantee that budget support loans would help
implement key structural reforms while the overall economic environment remains sound, and would help
the government leverage other external borrowing. The guarantee(s) would facilitate private participation
in critical infrastructure projects in water and power provided overall improvement on the issues
discussed in paragraph 27.
109.
The Jordan CAS program may also benefit from the use of new instruments. On the DPL
side, given the volatility of the macro environment a Deferred Drawdown Option may work well for the
Government. IFC and the Bank are also testing the possibility of promoting sub-national lending from the
Municipal Fund with the Amman Municipality, as part of the Local Development Cluster.
110.

IFC will provide a blend of lending, equity investment, and TA from PEP-MENA.

111.
Communications and outreach are critical to improve the overall effectiveness of the Bank in a
context where the political process is more open, and the actors more diverse. As part of the CAS
preparation, a client survey is underway that should provide the basis for a communications strategy. The
main lines of the strategy are likely to include:
•
•
•
•

Establish an editorial committee for the Bank’s Jordan Quarterly Update, and include material on
global and regional Bank initiatives that exemplify core bank values, and achievements.
Regular outreach events by task teams to describe Bank programs to stakeholders and local
communities, with media coverage.
Communication of Bank and IFC project and polices through audio and video media. IFC’s new
field office in Jordan has started this effort.
Train journalists on the World Bank Group activities in Jordan.

VII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION WITHIN A RESULTS
FRAMEWORK

112.
The CAS result framework will be anchored in the Government’s own results framework
developed under the National Agenda. The National Agenda provides quantitative Key Performance
Indicators to monitor implementation. Under each cluster, project and activities will also put particular
stress on establishing appropriate monitoring and evaluation system. Finally, the Public Sector Capacity
loan, and an ongoing Institutional Development Grant are supporting the Government overall capacity in
monitoring and evaluation.
113.
This will be the first CAS in Jordan to implement an explicit result-framework. At the same
time, the project pipeline is relatively thin. Overall, it will be possible in only a few areas within this CAS
period, to have a full range of relevant outcomes indicators that could be affected by the Bank program. In
the other areas, this CAS will be setting the baseline for the result-framework of following Bank
Assistance programs.
114.
The Government’s overall monitoring and evaluation system is currently extremely limited, and
its introduction in the context of the National Agenda is likely to be uneven, and face initial
implementation challenges. However, the quality and frequency of some data, for instance on poverty and
unemployment statistics, is sufficiently good to allow good follow up on some of the key objectives of the
CAS.

26

VIII.
A.

CREDITWORTHINESS AND RISKS

CREDITWORTHINESS AND BANK EXPOSURE

115.
Jordan remains a country with a high exposure: at end calendar year 2004, IBRD exposure
was US$971 million (IDA US$47 million) and projected to remain below US$1.0 billion at the end of
this CAS period. The share of preferred creditor debt service in total debt service, estimated at over 40
percent in 2004, exceeds the guideline, but is projected to fall under the 40 percent threshold by the end of
the CAS period. The other exposure guidelines are currently met: the share of IBRD debt service in public
debt service is around 13 percent, ratio of IBRD debt service to exports 1.3 percent. The former is
projected to increase to 16 percent by the end of the CAS period, while the latter will decrease to 1.0
percent. Compared to other Bank borrowers, IBRD exposure is also high relative to GNI, exports and
population. Overall, under the Base Case scenario exposure is projected to decrease, on the back of large
repayments to the Bank.

B.

RISKS

116.
Jordan is vulnerable to external shocks, due both to the fragility of the regional political
environment, and to the volatility of some key economic parameters. The economy is exposed to
commodity price fluctuations, volatile tourism receipts, and dependence on energy imports. External
financing has been heavily dependent on current transfers, including large workers’ remittances from the
Gulf countries, and official assistance, and most recently on private capital flows. At the same time, the
country's external and domestic debt burden remains high, notwithstanding progress towards debt
sustainability. Risks associated with large external current account deficits have increased notably, as
discussed in the macroeconomic section.
117.
Jordan is also significantly affected by regional economic and political developments, including
the transition in Iraq which has re-emerged as an important trading partner, the developments in the
Palestinian territories, and threat of terrorism in the Region. Jordan also faces a number of domestic social
challenges related to its demographics, persistently high unemployment, and the domestic repercussions
of regional conflicts.
118.
Political stability, relatively good governance, and broad-based external support, which have
allowed Jordan to weather such volatile environment in the past, are expected to continue in the future.
Nevertheless, increasingly complex demands of medium-term adjustment, service delivery, investment
promotion in productive economic activities and poverty alleviation will take place in a challenging
environment and for the first time over a long period, outside an IMF program. In transition to a more
stable, growth stimulating macroeconomic stance, availability of adequate resources, including expected
current and capital inflows, channeled increasingly from short term investment instruments and real estate
into foreign exchange generating investments, particularly in manufacturing and services, are critical. In a
downside scenario, however, macroeconomic instability resulting from inappropriate macro/fiscal policy
mix that will promote increase in speculative short-term capital inflows and vicious circle of low growth
or inadequate response to a shortfall in external inflows are possible, with repercussions on the economic
and social gains of recent years.

Organizations (CBOs) supported throughout Youth/Zenid
Jordan, before the main October workshop, which was attended by 54 participants, representing 30
organizations and representatives from the World Bank Group.
The discussions revolved around the main four thematic areas of the CAS. Reports on each subconsultation were provided as well as a consolidated report and a report for the main workshop. This final
report involves the outcomes and points of discussion for each theme.
Cluster 1: Strengthening the Investment Environment for a Skill-Intensive and Knowledge Based
Economy
Participants in the consultations expressed their concerns about the constraints negatively affecting the
investment environment in Jordan. They called for better incentives, including lowering the taxes and
setting up a high salary rate for Jordanian laborers. They stressed the need to:
¾
¾
¾
¾
¾

provide the supporting environment that enhances the investment initiatives;
focus on creating an environment attractive to investment at the governorate level;
link education to the needs of the local market, and enhance capacities accordingly;
establish industrial cities and touristic sites that provide opportunities for local labor;
expand the agricultural land through distribution of lands to farmers and ensure the access of
small farmers to water resources and support them with grants (not loans); and
¾ ensure the use of knowledge and science, experience gain, activate the role of training and
link it to employment and commit investors to employ the local people.

•

Education: The consultations revealed young people’s concerns about education as a whole.
They recognize that the old system was no longer suitable but they have concerns about the
reform. They feel that: (i) it has been introduced without proper planning; (ii) People concerned
were not involved and the reform does not meet their needs; (iii) the teachers were not properly
trained; and (iv) it has led to less time for questions and answers.
The participants also mentioned the need to:
¾ focus on the quality of education;
¾ build transferable skills, personal development and citizen skills, as well as sector knowledge;

36

¾
¾
¾
¾

promote local decisions and make sure that education was designed to meet local needs;
allocate resources to primary and secondary education;
ensure that young people have a voice in the system; and
ensure that students also learn about broader issues, such as entrepreneurialism, productivity,
respect, rights and responsibility.

Participants also felt that information and communications technologies (ICT) in teaching were
essential, but neither students, nor teachers, nor classrooms are ready.
•

Microfinance:
Although
the
government
promotes
microenterprise as a major strategy to
combat poverty and enhance selfreliance, interventions should be
closely monitored to ensure that they
contribute to the positive sustainable
livelihood outcomes for the poor.
Participants feel that poor people do
not necessarily see this as the solution
to their problems, because of (i) the
high cost of loans; (ii) poor people
would prefer grants or reduced
interest rate loans targeting the poor;
(iii) the poor could not meet the terms
and conditions imposed, and (iv)
many participants suggested the need
for big government or NGO projects
where the poor could get employment
with regular wages.

The team held consultations with small producers who have set
up micro-enterprise. They commented that:











The local skill and resource base is not sufficient to produce
viable businesses (poor products, bad packaging, and weak
marketing).
Local CBOs which implement such projects have little
business experience.
The markets are already saturated with not enough ideas
and not enough customers and markets.
Lack of information in terms of producers "production
capacity and locations".
Inadequate marketing outlets and geographical limitations.
There was a sense of frustration because of the failure of
previous interventions to deliver the needed support. The
support in some cases, when provided, did not deliver the
expected outcomes and impacts.
Availability of cheaper alternative in the market - imported
goods "cheaper, better, quality".
In spite of the fact that the support to this sector targets
women, the gender obstacles remained.

The main issues/questions raised by the participants were:
¾ Do micro-enterprise projects really empower people socially or economically?
¾ In-depth holistic studies of the sector and the long term impact of the MFI on sustainable
livelihoods are needed.
¾ Consider the real situation of the clients, need to financial resources, knowledge base and
skills to manage projects, supporting environment, procedures, collaterals.
¾ Increase access to the appropriate forms of credit for the poor in an environment which
supports the poor in establishing and expanding their enterprises.
¾ What is the impact of the vulnerability context on the microfinance?
¾ A broader package of support is needed including business training, capacity building and
general empowerment.
¾ Poor people prefer stable income, health and pension rights. They are not ready to take the
risks of the microfinance, but at the same time they are not responding to opportunities like
QIZs.
Cluster 2: Supporting Local Development through Increased Access to Services and Economic
Opportunities
Participants expressed the desire to be more actively involved in issues relating to their lives and
conveyed the need to focus on local level strategies which have more immediacy than national strategies.
They believe CSOs’ role in ensuring that the process is effective is important. They also stated that the

37

Government should take the necessary steps to ensure that the appropriate policies and institutions are in
place to support the local economy and allocate the needed resources and ensure the translation of policies
into action.
Participants feel the need for “opportunities for all” and called for “better” access to resources and
distribution of benefits. Local communities tended to note that local plans were more effective at
stimulating the local economy, using local resources and adapting to local limitations and constraints.
They urged that such investment be planned at the local level, with the participation of local people.
There were concerns that the current processes are not transparent and that decision-makers are not
accountable to local people.
Participants also expressed the need to:
•

Enhance Decentralization: Participants reported being unaware of the Government’s
decentralization process. In addition, the fact that, in the past, other committees/plans/campaigns
(i.e., Economic Consultative Council, Jordan First) were not implemented, undermined people’s
confidence that the new ones would be. Participants would like an explicit and comprehensive
strategy that clearly defines the goals of the country's decentralization policies. They called for a
program of enhancing the local development processes in terms of the following: (i) involvement
and participation of the different segments of population (in particular women and youth); (ii)
formal inclusion of the CSOs representatives to local level decision-making processes; (iii) more
autonomy to plan, budget and execute projects at the local level; and (iv) allocation of budget to
local level coupled with a greater degree of autonomy to make decisions concerning resource
allocations.

•

Strengthening Municipalities: In the
consultations, most participants expressed
a view that the services they currently get
at the local level do not meet their needs.
Their reactions and responses differed:
some expressed a high degree of fatalism
believing that little could be done. Others
believed that nepotism and wasta plays
negatively against the progress and the
development at the regional level in
Jordan.

Women from JOHUD’s Makana programme (a
programme to empower locals) who took part in the
consultations confirmed the need to, at the local level, gain
the necessary knowledge, skills, attitudes and systems to
engage civil society in the planning process. The Makana
women indicated that, since they have been able to gain
such skills, they can, and actually do, engage with local
decision-makers at municipal level. They spoke of their
role in ensuring that local service providers deliver better
quality services and how their actions had raised the profile
of women in the community.

The participants further expressed the need to:
¾ raise awareness of local-level planning and decision-making processes and their importance
for effective development with a wide range of stakeholders;
¾ create a network of civil society representatives to participate in local-level decision-making
and advocate for the poor and marginalized groups;
¾ enhance the capacity of decision-makers to carry out effective consultation processes to
ensure that the needs of poor and marginalized people are considered in the planning process;
and
¾ enhance the quality of local-level information and data collection and analysis so that
decision-makers are better informed about local level realities and so that local people can
monitor change.

38

Cluster 3: Reforming Social Protection and Expanding Inclusion
In spite of the findings of the Poverty Assessment, perception locally among the poor is that poverty is
still increasing and the situation has been exacerbated by the recent increase in fuel prices (by up to 60%).
In past consultations, community members expressed concerns that eligibility criteria used by NAF failed
to identify the poorest of the poor. There were also concerns raised that wasta played a considerable role
in people accessing assistance. The consultations revealed that poor people want this safety net to be
better managed. This includes:
¾ establishing an independent higher agency to manage all the funds providing support and
welfare, ensuring coordination between all aid and assistance bodies;
¾ establish a database that identifies the poorest of the poor and target groups according to the
identified criteria, and thus prevent the duplication in getting the assistance;
¾ provide the supporting environment to ensure effective targeting (including using the local
community and local community-based organizations (CBOs) to enhance the targeting
process);
¾ focus on the people with special needs;
¾ link NAF and the other cash assistance to training and work;
¾ avoid the sudden stop of the cash assistance without ensuring that the beneficiaries are able to
sustain themselves;
¾ establish specific counseling and legal services for women;
¾ ensure the access of the poor people to health insurance;
¾ revise the social insurance and pension laws and provide security for the unemployed;
¾ train employees to manage the NAF system in a fair and equitable manner; and
¾ adapt the NAF and the cash assistance to the economic situation in Jordan in order to
respond to people’s needs.
Cluster 4: Restructuring Public Expenditure and Supporting Public Sector Reform
Participants’ main concerns were:
¾ How to ensure that decision-makers and service providers are sensitized to issues related to
equity (gender mainstreaming, gender budgeting).
¾ Reform process should be accompanied by mechanisms to ensure the provision of
opportunities for people who would be affected by it.
¾ Identify criteria for employability in the government service based on efficiency and equal
opportunities.
¾ The reform process should be conducted in phases where the impact of each phase can be
evaluated especially on the poor and vulnerable.
¾ Reform process should not impact on the quality of services (education and health).
¾ Develop the concept of privatization for example privatize the management not necessarily
the assets; and ensure effective use of privatization resources.
B.

Private Sector Consultations

The Private Sector consultations in Jordan were divided into two sessions: one focusing on the financial
sector and the other addressing the private sector concerns. The financial sector session took place on
September 11th, 2005, and was hosted by the Euro-Jordanian Action for the Development of Enterprise
(EJADA), a European funded initiative that aims to build the capacity of SME and investment
environment in Jordan. Through EJADA’s network, the participants were mainly bankers, financial and
microfinance specialists.

39

The private sector session (September 2005) was hosted by Jordan Vision 2020 which is a spearheaded
initiative by the Young Entrepreneurs Association in Jordan. It represents an economic blueprint for
youth in Jordan and reflects a collective effort by private sector organizations to bring reform,
modernization and development. The participants were active businessmen, young entrepreneurs and
representatives of some investment businesses in Jordan.
The following points were discussed during the two sessions.
Enhancing the Investment Environment
Participants considered that Jordan needs funding to market itself as an investment destination. Most
countries do not know that Jordan is part of the Jordan-US Free Trade Agreement and the Jordan-EU
association agreement. Concerns were expressed by participants about the economy’s poor performance
which was partially due to failings of the private sector which included:
¾
¾
¾
¾

Lack of innovation;
Lack of research and development;
Poor business processes in the private sector; and
Poor strategy in the private sector.

Participants expressed the need to create special tax-free funds which would attract capital from local
banks and companies directed towards venture capital and seed financing. The fiscal condition in Jordan
is not conducive, some argued. They also expressed the need to create investment tax credits through
which banks and companies could substitute a small portion of their individual annual tax liabilities by
investing in government certified seed capital and venture capital funds to assist in creating new
companies, jobs. Possible guarantee schemes for venture capital investments could be an option to
support investment.
Improving the Banking Sector
Participants called for:
¾ The creation of a credit bureau to be shared between banks and companies.
¾ The development of specialized courts with trained judges who are familiar with banking issues
so that quick, effective, and binding judicial decisions can be made.
¾ The possibility of the World Bank helping local banks to raise long-term funds for industry,
similar to the "ECHO" program which was developed with the World Bank in the 1990s.
¾ The development of a securitization law for banks through which banks could securitize part of
their loan portfolio to create an asset backed financial instrument, and sell the instrument to retail
investors. Currently no such law exists in Jordan.
¾ The creation of a leasing law to facilitate leasing of mobile assets. Currently no such law exists
(or is not implemented). Banks are not giving leasing loans: IFC is currently supporting this.
¾ The existing Islamic banks shy away from implementing mudaraba (competition) and musharaka
(partnership) preferring to implement murabaha (profit). There is a need to develop Islamic banks
systems to facilitate offering more entrepreneur-friendly financing such as mudaraba and
musharaka.
Participants talked about gaps that are impeding the development of the Banking system:
¾ Need for a database on clients, credit bureau, and securitization.
¾ The client lacks knowledge in filling financial statements, in the mechanism of cash flow, in
costing, in drafting feasibility studies.

40

¾ The credit officers in turn are not well trained to orient the client with possible entries and
potential funding.
¾ A body that has technical capacity to allocate budgets to municipalities is needed with expertise
in lending and following up on projects. This should also involve a team that can teach people
how to approach banks and to conduct feasibility studies (e.g. ERADA, EJADA).
¾ A credit bureau is needed to provide historical data on client ( based on compiled data from
taxation department, social security, etc).
Consolidation of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
While recognizing the slow momentum of the small enterprises to take off and to play a role in the
economy, participants called for funding microfinance and SMEs through (a) IFC direct funding to
microfinance institutions; (b) IFC providing facilities to commercial banks for microfinance institutions;
and (c) World Bank providing guarantees to local banks such that they could be more active in the
microfinance market directly or working through existing institutions as well as making finance available
through matching grant/ fund programs.
Participants were concerned that:
•
•
•
•

SMEs were unable to utilize the substantial liquidity in Jordanian banks because of the collateral
requirements of the banks.
Clarity in the regulations and rules to better the relationship between banks and SMEs. Discussions
also touched on how existing bank liquidity could be liberated for corporate, SME and microfinance
uses.
Need to offer training programs to raise the level of competence among SME managers/owners
when approaching banks to include such items as cash flow projections.
Banks risk giving money to SMEs: there should be a plan to permit new entrances to SMEs- aiming
to support the poor. Several issues must be considered:
¾
¾
¾
¾
¾
¾
¾
¾

•

people with little collaterals;
Banking sectors/ branches are highly centralized;
Risk avert;
Lend collaterals;
Repayment not linked to cash flow;
Exit policy;
Ethical grounds to transactions; and
Little transparencies.

To support SMEs , some issues must be considered:
¾
¾
¾
¾

Guarantees to banks supporting SMEs and microfinance projects are needed.
Need capacity building of employees at the banks business edge.
Finance: a risk-sharing facility on SMEs is needed.
Microfinance: need for a mechanism of safe funding - a guarantee fund to secure the
microfinancing in Jordan in order to help small businesses.
Entrepreneurial Skills

It was clearly recognized that there is a need to change the Jordanian mindset to become more
entrepreneurial. It is, therefore, necessary to make a role for the private sector in supporting vocational
training and in absorbing its trainees. Concerns were expressed about its weakness and the unsuccessful
experience.

41

Industrial Sector
There is a need to fund waste water treatment particularly industrial waste water which could be treated
for agriculture. The Industrial Development Bank needs to have a long term guarantee scheme to
guarantee partnerships. Egypt, for example, has established a successful scheme that expanded into
supporting entrepreneurs and microfinance.
Trade
Trade finance facilities such as export guarantees with the government and local banking sector should be
developed to help facilitate increased exports in order to achieve sustainable economic and financial
development. Export guarantees are also needed.
Regional Development and Empowerment of Municipalities
Participants believed that economic development must be addressed at the grassroot level to help create
opportunities in less fortunate areas. Discussions focused on the efforts of microfinance lending and the
good job many of the institutions had achieved.
Some concerns were raised about increased corruption in the system. When decentralization was tried in
the 1970s at the government level, it was quickly re-centralized due to large corruption at the municipal
level.
Participants believed that Municipal Funds should be introduced at the regional level: municipalities must
be empowered to extend commercial grants.
Several participants expressed concern about the Jordanian culture of shame in what may concern work
opportunities for unskilled workers. They called for incentives for Jordanian laborer to accept work and
raise wages.

42

CAS Annex IV- IFC Programs and Activities
1.
IFC has historically experienced solid demand for financing from successful private sector
companies in Jordan. In recent years, however, there has been a decline in the portfolio due to
competition (cheaper alternative financing) and excess liquidity in the market—which has resulted in
prepayments and cancellations. In 2005, IFC established a new field office in Amman to accelerate its
investments and technical assistance business development activities, enhance the relationship with the
private sector and the government, and improve coordination and collaboration with IBRD and the donor
community.
2.
IFC’s strategy in Jordan places a high priority on seeking new investment opportunities in the
following areas: (i) promoting export-oriented and foreign exchange generating investments, particularly
in manufacturing and services; (ii) encouraging private participation in infrastructure; (iii) attracting
foreign private investment, particularly to the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZA); (iv) developing
the financial sector through promoting housing finance, microfinance, and trade finance; and (v)
contributing to improving the private provision of health and education, and support for the tourism and
ICT sectors. In addition, as a result of the establishment of IFC’s regional Technical Assistance (TA)
facility—the Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP-MENA)—TA activities in Jordan have significantly
increased covering a wide range of areas that contribute to private sector development. These activities
are being strategically selected and positioned to fill gaps, complement what other organizations and
donors are doing, respond to client demands, and ensure effective implementation. With this wider range
of products that IFC can offer, a coherent country strategy has been formulated to utilize new
opportunities.
3.

The following sections highlight the various areas of IFC’s current and future activities in Jordan.

I.

PRIVATIZATION AND ENCOURAGING PRIVATE PARTICIPATION IN INFRASTRUCTURE

4.
At the request of the Government of Jordan (GoJ), IFC has assumed the role of the lead advisor to
the GoJ on the Rehabilitation and Expansion of the Queen Alia International Airport Project (QAIA). The
GoJ is seeking private participation in the project through international tendering. IFC is leading two
teams of legal and technical consultants to appraise the Project, prepare the Strategic Options Report to
the GoJ, market the Project to prospective investors, and implement the Tender, leading to the GoJ’s
selection of the winning bidder. IFC’s value-added role in this Project brings to bear its global experience
in similar transactions, ensures transparency and best practices, and helps with adequately marketing the
Project.
5.
In response to GoJ’s request, IFC conducted a study to assess the feasibility of privatizing
Royal Jordanian Airlines. The recommendations of the study confirmed that it is timely to move forward
with the privatization. IFC is expected to take a lead advisory role.
6.
In the power sector, IFC has expressed, in principle, its intent to finance the winning bidder of the
first Independent Power Plant (IPP) project in East Amman. The short listing and prequalification process
is underway.
II.

FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

7.
The involvement of IFC in developing the financial sector in Jordan will cover the following
areas:
(a)
Leasing: This TA project includes reviewing the legal and regulatory framework for leasing in
Jordan, providing capacity building and training to existing and new leasing institutions, raising public

43

awareness on leasing and its importance to SMEs’ access to finance, and promoting investments in this
sector. IFC’s own future investment in leasing will also be considered.
(b)
Corporate Governance for Banks: In partnership with the Association of Banks in Jordan, this
project will involve working with TA commercial banks to survey their corporate governance practices
and come up with a voluntary corporate governance code. This project complements IBRD’s effort to
assist the Central Bank of Jordan to enhance its supervision of commercial banks and ensuring proper
governance and compliance.
(c)
Microfinance: The involvement of IFC will include (i) a possible investment with one of the
existing MFIs to help with its expansion and the development of new lending products including microleasing; (b) the funding of a study to determine the feasibility of establishing a new for-profit MFI in
Jordan, and (c) working with CGAP and other donors to assist GoJ in improving the legal and regulatory
framework for Microfinance and to improve the implementation of the National Microfinance Strategy.
IFC’s role in this sector will encourage competition, expand MFIs’ client reach and products, and help in
the establishment of a conducive legal and regulatory framework.
(d)
Housing Finance: Aiming to stimulate the Housing Finance market in Jordan, IFC is exploring
the opportunity to invest in this sector with the objective of expanding the provision of housing finance.
IFC will also work with the relevant stakeholders, including regional and international banks to establish
institutions that can provide securitization and mortgage insurance which are expected to play a
significant role in developing the housing finance market.
(e)
IFC will also provide support to assist the establishment of a Credit Bureau in Jordan as well as
provide Trade Financing to Jordanian banks from its Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP).
III.

SUPPORTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT THROUGH PRIORITIZED INVESTMENTS

8.
In addition to the above-mentioned investments in the financial sector, IFC stepped up its
business development efforts to explore new investment opportunities with new local private sponsors.
During FY02-05, IFC committed US$60 million in four investments. New investments in FY06-10 will
focus on the shipping and logistics, health, manufacturing, ICT, financial, and tourism sectors. IFC’s
approach to these investments will seek to diversify the exposure, provide long-term debt financing, and
take selective equity stakes.
9.
Furthermore, IFC will closely work with the Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZA) and Aqaba
Development Corporation (ADC) to facilitate new foreign investments to Aqaba and explore potential
IFC financing of some of these investments.

IV.

SUPPORTING THE SME SECTOR AND IMPROVING THE BUSINESS ENABLING ENVIRONMENT

10.
SME development is a priority for the GoJ and IFC. In this regard, IFC has partnered with three
private training providers to promote and use IFC’s SME management training product “Business Edge”.
This Training of Trainers Program entails certifying local trainers and providing them with 36 working
books covering a wide range of managerial, operational, financial, strategic, and marketing topics to use
in their various training programs targeting the owners of SMEs. One focus of this program is to target
women owners of SMEs.
11.
To enhance the environment for doing business in Jordan, IFC, in collaboration with the Ministry
of Trade and Industry, is embarking on a TA project that aims to improve the procedures and systems for
inspections in the country. In addition, based on the 2006 Doing Business Report findings, IFC is working

44

with Jordan’s Investment Board (JIB) to review the Doing Business Indicators for Jordan to verify the
findings and better reflect the situation on the ground in preparation for the 2007 Doing Business Report.

V.

PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE

12.
IFC’s total committed portfolio in Jordan stands at US$59 million in 11 companies (see Annex
B8). In FY05, IFC committed US$25 million, and in FY06, the expected commitment is US$18 million.
Portfolio performance has been generally good. Extensive efforts have been devoted, however, to
improve the status of three projects in the manufacturing and agribusiness sectors. Recovery and
restructuring options are being considered.

VI.

COLLABORATION WITH IBRD

13.
The collaboration with IBRD has been significantly increased. It has involved working closely
on areas such as privatization, Public-Private partnerships, and enhancing the enabling environment for
the private sector. Going forward, the collaboration will include (i) participation in the design of IBRD’s
PSD and financial sector diagnostic assessments leading to the identification and implementation of IFC’s
TA activities, (ii) joint identification of Private Participation in Infrastructure opportunities, (iii) and
exploration of the possibility for providing sub-national financing through the Municipal Fund. The IFC
new field presence has facilitated better coordination with IBRD on a systematic and continuous basis.
The PSD consultations for this CAS were jointly prepared and led by the two institutions.
