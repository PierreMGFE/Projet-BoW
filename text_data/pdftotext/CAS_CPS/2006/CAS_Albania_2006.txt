EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Background. Albania has continued its strong performance in achieving high economic
growth through the implementation of its National Strategy for Social and Economic
Development (NSSED). During the implementation of the previous CAS, Albania enjoyed
macroeconomic stability and average real GDP growth rates of over 5 percent – the highest in
Southeastern Europe - underpinned by rising exports (albeit from a low base), and continuing
improvements in factor productivity. However, maintaining this performance will be
increasingly difficult, and Albania will need to attract much needed foreign direct investment
(FDI), increase public and private savings, accelerate accumulation of physical and human
capital, and improve governance structures to maintain its impressive progress to date. Despite
GDP per capita reaching an estimated US$ 2,040 in 2004, widespread poverty, high
unemployment, and wide regional disparities remain daunting challenges.
ii.
Much has been achieved towards establishing a market-based economy in Albania
since the beginning of transition in 1992. The last CAS period saw major progress especially in
privatization, trade liberalization and building a sound financial sector in the aftermath of the
pyramid schemes crisis of 1997 which profoundly interrupted Albania’s social and economic
progress. Institutional capacity at central levels has improved, although problems of poor
governance and state capture persist and constitute substantial barriers to investment. Albania
has also begun to decentralize government functions but the pace of devolution has been slow
due to political constraints and limited capacity at the municipal and local Government levels.
Nonetheless, the decentralization process holds great promise, given Albania’s characteristics, to
improve the delivery of services to the poorest Albanians, especially in health, education and
water supply.
iii.
The Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the European Union (EU) is
crucial to Albania. Eventual membership in the EU remains an overarching long-term vision in
the country, and negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU have
been a national priority. However, progress has been slow, due in part to a lack of progress in
improving perceptions of poor governance. Albania has recently completed the third progress
report of its NSSED, and has begun to implement a new Integrated Planning System (IPS) in an
ambitious effort to streamline its policy development processes and integrate numerous planning
frameworks such as the NSSED, the SAp, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)
framework, and the NATO Partnership for Peace. The IPS offers much promise with respect to
aligning government decision-making behind a coherent and coordinated long-term vision, and
ensuring that investment decisions are made within the framework of a sound Medium-Term
Budgeting Process (MTBP). The IPS also promises a framework to consolidate recent
improvements in donor coordination.
iv.
The World Bank Group (WBG) continues to be a strong development partner with
Albania. The WBG has provided strong support to Albania since 1991, including IDA
commitments totaling US$ 820 million, IFC commitments of US$ 125 million, and MIGA
guarantees totaling US$ 8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to improve,
with an increasing focus on long-term capacity development and implementation through
Government structures. A CAS Completion Report for the 2002 CAS, informed by evaluations
by OED and QAG, concluded that the Bank’s assistance has been satisfactory, although

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

outcomes in the areas of governance have not been as positive as anticipated.
v.
The new Results-Based Country Assistance Strategy. This fourth World Bank Group
CAS for Albania (a joint product of IDA/IBRD and IFC), covering the period FY06-FY09,
outlines a program of support including financing on modified IDA terms of up to US$ 86
million as well as IBRD financing of up to US$ 110 million. Albania is expected to fully
graduate from IDA to IBRD by the end of FY08. The timing of the CAS coincides with the
political cycle in Albania -- parliamentary elections in July 2005 resulted in the formation of a
new Government with a four-year mandate in September 2005.
vi.
The CAS program seeks to support Albania’s efforts in improving governance while
increasing selectivity. The new CAS recognizes that more coherent efforts need to be made to
address the challenge of poor governance in Albania, and introduces a ‘Governance Filter’
compromising of four core principles which will be used to ensure that governance
considerations are mainstreamed into all of the Bank’s interventions. The CAS program is also
more selective, focused on two pillars:
(I) Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development, with
expected outcomes including (a) macroeconomic stability; (b) improved business climate
through better quality of business regulations and improved public-private sector dialogue; (c)
improved public infrastructure; (d) increased operational efficiency of financial institutions; (e)
improved functioning of the land market; (f) improved corporate governance; (g) increased
transparency and efficiency in the management of public spending and stronger institutions for
planning, tendering and providing infrastructure and services; (h) better accountability in
public administration; and (i) better management and planning for Albanian coastal resources.
(II) Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors, with expected
outcomes including: (a) improved educational attainment and quality of basic education; (b)
improved efficiency and equity of health financing; (c) better quality of health care; (d)
improved fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and increased access to welltargeted, sustainable, and effective assistance; and (e) improved access to safe rural water
supply and sanitation.
vii.
A focused lending and ESW program is planned. Up to 11 new IDA/IBRD lending
operations are proposed in FY06-FY09, of which three would be a Programmatic Development
Policy Loan (DPL) series building on the success of the PRSC series in the previous CAS. A
lending range (US$ 75 – 196 million) is proposed for the CAS, with actual lending to be
determined by progress against a set of key milestones specified in the monitoring framework for
the CAS. A CAS Progress Report is planned for FY08.
viii. The program is designed to mitigate risks that could limit the effectiveness of the
proposed program and impede achievement of outcomes. The new CAS recognizes that
achieving the outcomes articulated in the Results Framework will be subject to risks, particularly
in the form of internal or regional political instability and external economic shocks. Strong
political commitment in the region to EU integration and flexibility in the proposed support
program will serve to reduce these risks.

THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Albania’s record since it embarked on its transition in the early 1990s has been
impressive. The country has successfully built the foundations of market-based economy, created
democratic institutions and gradually built capacity in the public administration to cope with
political and economic transformation. These efforts have resulted in a track record of
macroeconomic stability, as well as achievement of the fastest rates of GDP growth in South
Eastern Europe (SEE). Such achievements notwithstanding, Albania remains one of the poorest
countries in Europe with an income per capita estimated at US$ 2,040 (Atlas method) in 2004,
widespread poverty, high unemployment rate, substantial regional disparities, and weak
governance structures.
2.
The proposed CAS for FY06-FY09 builds on the experience of the World Bank Group
(WBG) since the early 1990s (through three CASs).1 It is oriented towards results, is based on
systematic WBG collaboration, and was prepared in consultation with country authorities,
development partners and other stakeholders. The CAS aims to support Albania’s National
Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and the European Union (EU)
Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the ultimate objective of EU integration and
the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed activities of the
CAS are clustered around two pillars: (i) fostering economic growth through support to private
sector development; and (ii) improved service delivery, particularly in the social sectors.
Governance will be mainstreamed in all programs and projects supported by the CAS through
the use of clearly defined criteria for evaluating the design and impact of all Bank interventions.
The CAS will employ a selected mix of Bank and IFC financing and a targeted program of WBG
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) support.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
A.

Political and Social Context

3.
For the fifth time since 1990 Albanian citizens successfully selected 140 members of
Parliament, through national elections held in July 2005.2 The elections process was conducted
in line with the Electoral Code and adhered to fundamental democratic principles.3 The voting
process itself was peaceful and demonstrated improvements over previous parliamentary
elections, but the vote counting process and finalization of results witnessed considerable delays
and faced technical and administrative problems. The Democratic Party (DP), led by exPresident Sali Berisha, emerged as the largest party in the new Parliament with 56 seats and
consequently formed the new Government in a broad coalition with other smaller parties. The

DP platform for the elections and its current program focus on improving governance and the
rule of law, reducing corruption and breaking monopolies, improving the business environment,
accelerating rural development and fostering human capital development. Dr. Berisha was
elected as Prime Minister in September 2005. The transfer of power was smooth and the new
government has since consolidated the number of ministries in an effort to rationalize public
spending and to improve coordination within the public administration. The new government
confirmed its strong commitment to accelerating Albania’s efforts towards integration in the EU
(through the SAp) and NATO structures, the implementation of the NSSED (Albania’s PRSP),
and the integration of the various existing policy frameworks into a single medium term
development plan through the Integrated Planning System (IPS).
4.
The Socialist Party (SP) now forms the major opposition party. Though the SP-led
governments changed four times during 1997-2004, a good record in economic management and
in the formulation and implementation of the NSSED was maintained. The split in the leadership
of the SP and the formation in September 2004 of the independent Socialist Movement for
Integration (SMI), by ex-Premier Ilir Meta, contributed partly to the loss of the SP’s majority in
the 2005 parliamentary elections. Following the resignation of the former prime minister, Mr.
Fatos Nano, from the leadership of SP, the party elected the Mayor of Tirana, Mr. Edi Rama, as
its new leader in October 2005 and reviewed its platforms in preparation for the local elections in
2006. Political polarization and strong rivalry between the two largest parties (DP and SP)
remain sources of potential instability, and represent hurdles for forging a national consensus for
necessary reforms to accelerate the pace of economic development and successful integration in
the EU.
5.
The decentralization process gained considerable momentum in the last five years.4
Although Albania started on a path of political decentralization in 1992, the pace of devolution
picked up markedly in the last five years because of the strong demand for improving public
service delivery, governance and accountability in the use of public resources, and strengthening
local autonomy. Following the ratification of the European Charter for Local Self-Local
Government and the adoption of the Law on the Functioning and Organization of Local SelfGovernment in 2000, a Government Decentralization Implementation Strategy was approved,
and good progress has since been made in establishing institutional arrangements for
implementation of the strategy. The major achievements in the last three years include: (i)
completion of the basic legislative framework for territorial administration; (ii) implementation
of the existing regulation on local government property rights; (iii) assignment of specific
responsibilities and authorities to local governments—including those concerning sharedfunctions; (iv) assignment of an adequate degree of revenue autonomy to local authorities, and
establishment of an equalization transfer mechanism to minimize bureaucratic and political
influence; and (v) adoption of a training strategy for local public officials.
6.
However, the decentralization process is still hampered by several constraints. Though
confidence in local governments is increasing and a few municipalities and communes have been
able to achieve tangible results in service delivery and urban development (e.g., the Municipality
4

For a detailed review on progress in decentralization in Albania and the remaining challenges, see World Bank
(2004) “Albania: Decentralization in Transition”. Report No. 27885-ALB, Poverty Reduction and Economic
Management Unit, Europe and Central Asia Region, the World Bank; February 2004.

of Tirana), the implementation of reforms to successfully decentralize fiscal and administrative
decisions has been uneven and is lagging behind schedule. There are still institutional
weaknesses and low implementation capacity which limit the voice and participation of citizens
in local affairs as well as the transparency, and accountability of local governments. Political
resistance and bureaucratic stumbling blocks also continue to delay the pace of decentralization.
The specific competencies of regions, municipalities and communes need more clarification,
especially for shared functions, to avoid inefficiencies and duplication or under-provision of
services. The drafting of the new Law on Local Budget and the new Law on Local Finance
(including the badly needed national tax sharing arrangement) is still pending. The fragmentation
of local government units and the undefined role of the regions complicate a uniform attribution
of responsibilities and affects local public service delivery efficiency, fiscal transparency and
fiduciary accountability.
7.
Albania has also made good progress in improving social sector outcomes. In addition
to economic and political transformation, Albania is also on track to meet the MDGs particularly
those related to social sector outcomes, although data constraints precludes comprehensive
analysis of the post-transition trends (Box 1). Albania’s current demographic profile is
characterized by three main phenomena: large internal and external migratory waves, improving
mortality rates and declining fertility rates. The population’s age structure has changed
significantly in the past decade. The population below 15 years of age is now decreasing and the
population over 65 years is growing faster than the rest of the adult population. Though
population growth and fertility rates have been falling, Albania still has one of the highest
fertility rates and the youngest population in Europe.5 The Albanian population remains
predominantly rural, although the cities, particularly Tirana, have grown very rapidly over the
past 15 years. The labor force began the transition balanced by gender but has shown a growing
preponderance of males. It is mostly rural (65 percent) and 62 percent have less than secondary
education. Labor force participation rates dropped by 14 and 19 percentage points for males and
females respectively between 1993 and 2003. Unemployment remains widespread (officially
estimated at 14.4 percent in 2004, down from 15 percent in 2003) especially in urban areas
despite marked declines in registered unemployment in the last decade.6
8.
Most health and education indicators have continued to improve over the past decade.
Current health outcomes compare favorably with those of lower middle income countries outside
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region, but lag behind those of other countries in SEE. Despite
recent progress, Albania still has the lowest healthy life expectancy and the highest infant
mortality rates in SEE. Albania achieved universal enrollment rate in basic education at the start
of transition, but began with among the poorest enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary
education in the region. Between 1990 and 2002, gross enrollment rates declined at all levels of
education except for higher education.7 In the last three years, modest improvements in
enrolments rates at all education levels have been recorded.
5

Albania’s total population is estimated at 3.1 million in 2004 and is projected to increase to 3.7 million by 2025.
An estimated 0.8 – 1.0 million Albanians currently live outside of Albania.
6
Between 1993 and 2003, registered unemployment fell by 46 percent.
7
Between 1989 and 2002, gross enrollment rate declined from 103 percent to 99.6 percent for basic education, and
- more drastically - from 78.5 percent to 43.6 percent in secondary education (mainly due to the closure of many
secondary vocational training schools). During the same period, gross enrollment rates in higher education rose
significantly from 6.6 percent to 17 percent mainly as a result of expansion in part-time enrollments.

The SEE countries have already achieved or are likely to achieve over half of the MDGs, though some countries
have vulnerability with regard to meeting few of the MDGs. The MDG on HIV/AIDS and other diseases is the
major regional concern.
Albania is on track to meet all of the MDGs, though data constraints renders this assessment tentative.
MDG1 (Eradicate poverty and hunger): Albania is on track to meet the poverty MDG. However, the country
has only one nationally representative survey in many years (LSMS, 2002) to provide the first reliable estimate
of poverty (with a consumption module). The LSMS 2005 will enable better assessment of the trend next year.
MDG2 (Achieve universal primary education) and MDG3 (promote gender equity and empower women): The
official national enrollment rates and primary completion rates tend to suggest that the MDG target for
education is likely to be met. The most recent LSMS, however, produces an enrolment rate of 93 percent. On
the basis of the most recent data, the Gender MDG target is also likely to be met. The high girl/boy completion
rate (grade 8), however, indicates that there may be a problem with boys leaving school early.
MDG4 (reduce child mortality – U5MR) and MDG5 (improve maternal health-MMR): While the apparent
downward trend in U5MR is encouraging, there is not enough data and evidence to conclude that the MDG
target for child mortality will be met. Immunization rates for measles and DTP3 are showing slight increases.
Administrative MMR data point to a declining trend over recent years (though estimates of UNICEF, UNFPA
and WDI point to increases in MMR). Static health spending along with poorly performing prenatal care,
hospital network and referral systems makes achievement of these goals less certain than others.
MDG6 (Combat HIV/AIDs, Malaria and other diseases-HIV infection rates and Tuberculosis incidence):
Albania is on track to meet the MDG target regarding Tuberculosis. However, while the current HIV/AIDS
levels appear low, Albania is a high risk population and the number of cases is rising rapidly.
MDG7 (ensure environmental sustainability – proportion of people with access to improve water sources):
While WHO-UNICEF data indicate that this target is likely to be met, the most recent LSMS data implies that
there is still some way to go to meet it.

B.

Economic Developments since the Last CAS

9.
Albania succeeded in sustaining high rates of economic growth and pursuing
structural reforms in the last three years. After a slowdown in 2002 caused by electricity
shortages and floods, output growth recovered to 5.7 percent in 2003 and 5.9 percent in 2004.8
Aggregate demand (consumption and investment), supported by external aid flows and
remittances, have been the driving forces behind GDP growth. Export growth also accelerated,
underpinned by favorable weather conditions, which benefited both agriculture and agroprocessing, and by a pick-up in tourism. Favorable weather conditions also resulted in
8

See the CAS Completion Report (Annex 1) for economic developments during 1990-2002. Albania has also been
benefiting from IMF support in the form of post-conflict emergency assistance program (November 1997) and two
ESAF/PRGF arrangements (1998-2001, 2002-2005).

improvements in power generation. In the last three years, structural reforms have progressed,
particularly in areas of privatization, financial sector development, energy reforms and trade
liberalization. The privatization process advanced significantly with the successful privatization
of the Savings Bank in December 2003, followed by steps to privatize public enterprises in the
insurance, telecom and oil sectors expected to be completed in 2006. Electricity sector reforms
have substantially reduced the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, including
through increased production and improved collection. Albania continues to implement its
commitments under the WTO and has signed and ratified Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with
all neighboring countries. In other key areas of structural reforms however, progress remains
slower than desired, including reforms in the business environment for the private sector,
infrastructure services, and the quality of public sector management.

Macroeconomic stability in Albania has been maintained since 2002. Monetary and
financial policies have curbed inflation, fostered confidence in the national currency and spurred
credit to the private sector. Monthly inflation rates have been maintained within the 2–4 percent
target range. Confidence in the national currency has improved as reflected in the steady
appreciation of the Lek. This was mainly driven by the favorable macroeconomic outlook, large
inflows of official assistance, private remittances and growing, though limited, foreign direct
investment (FDI). The Savings Bank’s privatization and the easing of the monetary policy stance
through a steady lowering of interest rates, has contributed to a rapid pick-up in private sector
credit growth, albeit from a low base.
11.
Nonetheless, the quality of fiscal adjustment has not seen marked improvements. First,
the efficiency of public spending remains low particularly in the social sectors. Second, while
fiscal consolidation has been successful in reducing large public sector deficits, expenditures on
priority areas have often fallen short of the stated objectives under the NSSED. The overall
budget deficit (after grants) declined from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2001 to 5.1 percent in 2004. In
parallel, the total public debt to GDP ratio fell from nearly 67 percent to about 56.6 percent
during the same period. Sustained economic growth, falling interest rates, and the use of

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

privatization proceeds to retire public debt have all contributed to the decline in debt ratios. This
improvement notwithstanding, the reduction in the deficit resulted largely from a decline in
capital spending, and has slightly affected spending on education, which declined from 3.3
percent of GDP in 2001 to 3.1 percent in 2004. In almost every year, revenues fell short of
projections, remaining almost constant as a share of GDP. Weak tax and customs administration
capacities and a large informal sector and lack of tax compliance, resulted in a tax to GDP ratio
among the lowest in transition economies. The Government has recently redoubled its efforts to
address these problems, and achieved a current surplus for the first time since transition. The
2005 budget also included measures to reduce public sector borrowing requirements and improve
the realism of revenue forecasting. The program of the new Government focuses on widening the
tax base and reducing tax evasion as well as improving tax administration.9
12.
A broad-based export-driven output growth has not yet taken root. Improvements in the
external position notwithstanding, Albania’s trade deficit remains at relatively high levels and
the country is lagging behind other SEE countries in terms of openness as measured by the ratio
of trade to GDP. Exports picked up with an annual real growth rate of 19 percent in 2003-2004.
This expansion, however, has a narrow base and is heavily concentrated in low value added
exports, despite productivity gains resulting from an increasingly open trade regime and greater
economic liberalization.10 Consequently, the trade deficit remains relatively large at 22 percent
of GDP. Remittances, at around 14 percent of GDP, still constitute the main source of financing
the trade deficit. FDI remains among the lowest in the region (less than 3 percent of GDP).
While the current account balance declined from 7.0 percent of GDP in 2002 to 3.8 percent in
2004, expectations of a reduction in concessional external financing, and the hardening of
borrowing terms, remain key challenges. The sustainability of FDI trends remains fragile, as the
privatization program is nearing completion and improvements in the business climate have been
slow.

Tax revenues range from 30 percent to 50 percent of GDP in the region. In Albania, the level of tax rates is in line
with regional and international standards. However, collection of the personal income and the social security taxes
has been the lowest performers [IMF (2002) “Albania: Selected Issues in Tax Design”. IMF -February 2004].
10
The vast majority of Albanian exports and imports have been destined to or originating in the EU (around 90%
and 70 % respectively), while exports to SEE countries accounted for only 0.8 percent of total exports in 2003.

Lek 4,891 per capita per month to Lek 5,380) the proportion of the population counted as poor
would be expected to increase from a quarter to a third. However, little extreme poverty - defined
as the proportion of the population with a monthly income of no more than Lek 3,050 (the food
poverty line) - exists. In 2002, only 5 percent of the population was estimated to be extremely
poor. Inequality in Albania is also modest - an observation confirmed by a moderate Gini
coefficient of 0.28 and a ratio of 90th to 10th percentile consumption of 3.6.11
14.
Most of the poor people are concentrated in the Mountain region. The 2002 Living
Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) and detailed poverty mapping, using the Population and
Housing Census of 2001, lead to three conclusions regarding the spatial dimensions of poverty.
First, rural poverty is significantly higher than urban poverty, by a factor of at least 10
percentage points. Rural residents comprise more than two-thirds of the two poorest
consumption quintiles. Second, the Mountain region (the North and the North-east agroecological area) has the worst poverty outcomes of four well-defined regions (Tirana, Coastal,
Central and Mountain). Almost one-half of the population in this area is poor and one in five (20
percent) cannot meet basic food needs (Figure 2). Finally, within prefectures, Dibra, Kukes,
Lezhe and Shkodra exhibit the highest levels of head count poverty, with more than one-third of
the population living below the poverty line.
FIGURE 2: SPATIAL DIMENSION OF

attainments are the main factors driving poverty.
While household size is a strong indicator of
poverty, employment status and education
attainment are important determinants of poverty in
Albania. Households with unemployed heads of
household have poverty rates that are twice as high
as in those in which the head of the household is
employed. In Tirana, 32 percent of the unemployed
heads of households are poor, compared to 16
percent among employed heads of households. In
rural areas the corresponding figures are 51 percent
and 28 percent respectively. Among the poor, only
20 percent of children enroll in secondary education
compared to 50 percent among the non-poor.
Individuals employed in agriculture had
significantly higher poverty rates (29 percent),
compared to the self-employed and wage earners
(11 percent and 14 percent respectively). Poverty
affects women more than men and is widespread among minorities in Albania. The small
communities of Roma and self-identified "Egyptians” have been negatively affected by the
transition. They are now the poorest and most marginalized people in the country.12

Non-income dimensions of poverty are also pervasive. There are significant differences
in access and quality of basic social and infrastructure services. In rural and Mountain region
areas, both basic coverage and quality of services, such as education, health care, transportation,
running water and sanitation, are low. Less than 50 percent of rural households have running
water or toilets. While coverage of these services is nearly universal in urban areas, there is
evidence of quality failures, especially in peri-urban areas where families moving from deprived
regions have overcrowded already inadequate school systems and health facilities. The dynamics
of poverty in the last three years cannot be accurately determined. The additional LSMS data sets
collected in 2003 and 2004 did not include a consumption module, making it difficult to follow
consumption and poverty trends since 2002. However, a new LSMS is currently being finalized
with a consumption module. This will provide information to infer the recent poverty dynamics.

III. ALBANIA’S LONG-TERM VISION, MEDIUM-TERM PLANS, AND OUTLOOK
A.

Albania’s Long-Term Vision and European Integration

17.
Albania has articulated its long-term vision of joining the EU since it began its
transition. Since 1991, successive Albanian governments have placed the prospect of European
accession at the top of their agendas (Annex 9). The country is currently engaged in a
Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the EU.13 Primary aspects of the SAp dialogue
include provisions for: (i) strengthening of the judicial system, rule of law and public
administration; (ii) fighting against organized crime, trafficking and corruption; (iii) ensuring the
proper functioning of democracy (including elections) and preserving political stability; (iv)
improvement in human and minority rights; (v) further formalization and reform of the economy,
as well as increased fiscal sustainability through more efficient customs and tax administrations;
(vi) regional cooperation and reduced barriers to trade and foreign investment; and (vii)
approximation of Albanian legislation to EU legislation in a wide range of areas.
B.

The National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED)

18.
The NSSED is an inclusive development strategy. The NSSED, adopted in 2001, aims to
bring Albania’s living standards and income levels closer to the levels of its neighboring
European countries. It represents Albania’s serious effort to use a comprehensive medium-term
national development strategy to move from short-term crisis management to creating the
conditions that promote long-term growth and poverty reduction. The NSSED has strong
government ownership and was prepared through an unprecedented participatory process. It is
based on three pillars: (i) improving governance, (ii) promoting private sector development, and
(iii) fostering human resources development. The NSSED recognizes that weak governance and
institutions are at the root of Albania’s developmental problems, and acknowledges that
economic growth will be the main instrument to reduce poverty, raise standards of living, and
accelerate the attainment of the MDGs. It also contains improved poverty diagnostics and an
ambitious plan for monitoring and evaluation.

13

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

19.
Good progress has been made in implementation of the NSSED in the last three years.
The third Annual Progress Report of the NSSED, submitted to the World Bank and the IMF in
FY06, highlighted progress with regard to the increased focus on poverty reduction and support
to the social sectors, improved alignment of the NSSED with the SAp and the MDG frameworks,
and efforts to improve the linkages between the strategy, the Medium-Term Budget Process
(MTBP) and the annual budget. It underlines the need to continue structural reforms aimed at
maintaining economic stability and improving public service delivery. However, challenges
remain including weaknesses in the overall system of public expenditure management, persistent
weaknesses in the identification of priority projects by line ministries, and poor capacities for
implementation, monitoring and evaluation.14 The recent adoption of the IPS confirmed the
Government’s commitment to modernize and upgrade strategic planning, and strengthen public
expenditure management by linking resources to outcomes and gradually moving towards
performance based budgeting. The third NSSED progress report outlines the details of the new
planning architecture as the basis upon which the new NSSED will be built.
BOX 2: THE INTEGRATED PLANNING SYSTEM (IPS)
Albania’s Integrated Planning System (IPS), approved by the Council of Ministers in April 2005, was the result of a
10-month collaborative process between the Government and donors. Initially, the mutually-agreed objective was
to increase the effectiveness of external assistance. The government’s assessment, however, endorsed by donors,
concluded that external assistance problems could not be treated in isolation from design and execution flaws in the
broader government planning system. In preceding years, numerous planning frameworks, including the NSSED,
SAp, MTBP, NATO accession, the Government Program, and the annual legislative plan were implemented as
separate exercises, each with its own set of priorities, procedures and reporting requirements. Not surprisingly, this
produced multiple priorities, overlapping processes, an excessive reporting burden in ministries, and public
confusion. The overriding goal of the IPS is not to overlay yet another new planning system; rather it was designed
to serve as a unifying framework for existing systems. Key elements include:
• Creation of a political mechanism - the Strategic Planning Committee - chaired by the Prime Minister, to provide
strategic policy and fiscal planning directions;
• Establishment of a Government Modernization Program that may eventually include related initiatives, such as
functional reviews, e-government and service quality improvement;
• Transformation of the NSSED into a government-wide, strategic planning process, incorporating EU and NATO
integration, MDGs, the Government Program, decentralization and other cross-cutting strategies;
• Restoration of the MTBP as the exclusive process through which all cross-cutting and sector strategies compete
for funding and are translated into concrete plans, budgets, and expected results;
• Establishment of more strategic and comprehensive public investment and external assistance planning and
financial management processes;
• Restructuring of central institutions with planning mandates: moving NSSED to the Council of Ministers;
transferring public investment and external assistance functions from the Ministry of Economy to the Ministry of
Finance; creating an integrated delivery function (planning, budgeting, monitoring) within line ministries;
• Institutionalization of the Government-donor coordinating mechanisms to ensure ongoing collaboration and
effective deployment of external assistance.
Implementation of the IPS is a daunting task and will confront a range of challenges despite the firm commitment
of the new government on its implementation and the strong support of all development partners. If, however, IPS
is implemented at a measured pace over the next 3-5 years, a more coherent and stable policy environment will
emerge. For decision makers, the IPS will identify a series of clear decision points, where similar decisions (e.g.,
setting strategic priorities) are taken concurrently and competitively across all planning frameworks. For donors, the
IPS will create a single point of initial contact and a demand-driven system where external assistance proposals
flow from stated government priorities. For the public, the IPS will produce a single, annual published plan and
corresponding set of results for each ministry.

20.
The NSSED program for 2005-2006 focuses on pro-poor growth. Based on the pillars
of improving governance and sustaining high economic growth— the NSSED program for the
next two years focuses on economic growth to foster demand for labor as a key to broader
participation in the benefits of economic growth. It underlines the need to promote private sector
development by improving the investment climate and strengthening governance structures. It
places heavy emphasis on education, health care, and infrastructure as priority areas for
addressing key non-income dimensions of poverty, and to provide a sound basis for long-term
growth and competitiveness. It also recognizes the need for stronger public accountability and
increased public participation in decision making to empower the poor.
21.
The program of the new Government builds on the SAp and implementation of the
NSSED and the IPS (Box 2). In the short-term, the new Government program (‘me duar të
pastra’ – with clean hands) will focus on governance reforms including reduction of corruption
and organized crime, breaking monopolies, improving the business climate, and continuation of
administrative reforms. The Government program also accords special attention to preserving
macroeconomic stability, supporting rural development and social sectors and upgrading of
infrastructures. It gives special attention to the reforms of the education and health services and
social inclusion particularly for the Roma people. It also seeks to deepen reforms in the energy
sector, address the electricity shortages and rapidly open up the telecommunications markets.
C.

The Medium-Term Economic Outlook

22.
Albania could achieve relatively healthy growth in the medium-term. Despite stiffer
international competition, the prospects for high and sustained growth are good, provided that
structural reforms are stepped up in various areas. During the CAS period, macroeconomic
performance is assumed to be sustained, predicated on the following assumptions: (i) continued
fiscal consolidation and improvements in the quality of fiscal adjustment conducive to private
investment; (ii) acceleration of structural reforms aimed at improving the business environment,
the quality of infrastructure and public sector governance; and (iii) a relatively favorable external
environment that would help boost export growth. In the medium-term, sustaining high GDP
growth rates is conditional on an increase in aggregate demand, coupled with higher productivity
and exports. The combination of prudent macroeconomic policies and strong structural reforms
is projected to facilitate a rise in gross domestic investment (both public and private) from 23.8
percent of GDP in 2004 to 27.1 percent in 2009. This increased investment would be supported
by higher public and private domestic savings, with most of the increase taking place on the
public sector side. Current transfers from abroad (remittances) and factor incomes will continue
to be a major contributor to private national savings, but will increasingly be replaced by
domestically-generated private sector savings, thus reducing Albania’s current over-reliance on
external inflows. The increasing capacity to save and invest will be facilitated by bank and
enterprise sector reforms, fiscal consolidation, and increased competitiveness.
23.
The overall budgetary balance will continue its gradual improvement. Through the
pursuit of prudent fiscal measures, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to improve from 5.1
percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2009. The public sector contribution to growth

would result from a gradual reduction in current spending, primarily due to reduced subsidies
and operational costs, broadly matched by an expansion in capital expenditure, from 5.2 percent
of GDP in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2009. Expenditure policies would also focus on improving
efficiency in the use of resources, and better prioritization of investments. On the revenue side,
improved tax collection and a gradual expansion of the tax base (the major thrust of the program
of the new government) would increase revenues by at least 1 percentage point of GDP by 2009.
24.
Financing needs are projected to increase, and will gradually rely on access to nonconcessional financing. Total gross external financing needs are on average slightly above US$
1 billion per year during 2006-2009. These are required to finance: (i) large annual current
account deficits amounting to roughly US$ 2.7 billion over the period; (ii) amortization of
external debt of around US$ 502 million, and (iii) US$ 818 million of increases in net foreign
reserves. With the envisaged improvement in the fiscal balance, these financing needs will be
increasingly driven by private sector activity, as the expected fiscal retrenchment will leave more
room for the private sector. The base case scenario envisages a steady inflow of FDI resources,
although the pace will depend critically upon maintaining privatization efforts and further
improving the environment for doing business. Net FDI is projected to finance up to 41 percent
of total financing needs in 2006-2009, while long-term loans from multilateral, bilateral, and
other creditors are projected to account for 20 percent (Table 2).

25. World Bank analysis concludes that Albania can gradually increase non-concessional
borrowing without worsening debt indicators over time. Albania needs to implement economic
and financial policies measures in order to mobilize internal resources and to allow the country
to achieve creditworthiness and gradually tap market-based external resources. To maintain
fiscal and external sustainability in the medium term, the country has to focus on: (i) furthering
fiscal consolidation and improving the quality of the ongoing fiscal adjustment, (ii) substantially
improving the strategic management of debt, to reduce rollover risk for domestic debt and
smoothen out repayment flows, and (iii) deepening structural reforms aimed at increasing
exports and investment flows. Under the base-case scenario Albania could secure its financing
needs while maintaining solvency and liquidity indicators below standard sustainability
thresholds over the next decade. By gradually replacing short-term and higher cost domestic
borrowing with longer-term and lower cost external financing, while lengthening the maturity of

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

12

domestic debt stock, the ratio of total public debt to GDP would decline from around 55.9
percent in 2005 to 53.5 percent in 2009. The ratio of external debt to GDP would decline only
marginally to stay at a reasonably low level of 18.5 percent by 2009, while that of domestic debt
would be reduced from 37.7 percent to 35 percent over the CAS period (Annex 8).

IV. ALBANIA’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES
A.

Improving Governance Structures

26.
Further progress in poverty reduction, attainment of the MDGs and EU integration
will largely depend on addressing governance concerns. Despite continued efforts and some
recent progress, overall indicators of governance for Albania are at very low levels compared to
other countries in the region and other lower middle-income countries. Governance problems
continue to cloud Albania’s recent achievements and impact on the prospects of sustained
economic growth (e.g., low investment) and improved public service delivery. Corruption, for
example, has a direct impact on economic growth, FDI and quality and access to service delivery
in Albania. The Government’s performance on combating corruption and crime has become a
yardstick by which Albania’s readiness to progress towards EU accession will be measured.
27.
Weak governance is the major obstacle to improving the business climate. Pervasive
corruption, weak enforcement of the rule of law, limited government effectiveness and
inadequate regulatory quality are the main factors inhibiting private sector development.
However, recent governance data collated from various sources do point to modest
improvements in governance indicators in the period 2002 to 2004.15 Most positive is further
strengthening of the public space that allows civil society and the media to voice their views.
Regulatory quality is another dimension of governance on which Albania has made modest
improvements, bringing it closer to comparator countries. Administrative reforms at the central
government level are also beginning to have some positive impact. Recently, however, party
politics appear to have become increasingly competitive, and Albania continues to perform far
worse on political stability dimension of governance than other countries in the region.
28.
Control of corruption is the most pressing governance challenge for Albania. Survey
results indicate that customs, courts and hospitals are the institutions with the highest perceived
incidence of corruption, with analysis indicating that corruption of officials in Albania exceeds
the levels experienced in other countries in the region.16 State capture is pervasive, and likely
includes the infiltration of criminal elements in state entities. Respondents to opinion surveys in
Albania identify corruption as a primary cause of the lack of growth in jobs, and express a
general mistrust in political, legal and public sector institutions. Among public services, views
about corruption in the health sector are particularly bleak.

B.

Maintaining High Rates of Economic Growth

29.
Future sustainability of output growth hinges on export expansion, increased
productivity and higher levels of factor accumulation. While Albania’s economy has been
growing over the past decade at an average annual growth rate of 7 percent, the outlook for fast
and sustained GDP growth, which is critical to bringing living standards closer to those of new
EU member countries, faces several pivotal constraints.17 Poor governance in general is
pervasive across all sectors of the economy. Inefficient public sector hinders improvements in
the business environment. Quality of public services to support business is poor. Heavy reliance
on remittances and weak export performance constrain macroeconomic stability. Educational
attainments are lower than in most transition countries. Structural bottlenecks in infrastructure
lead to high input costs and also reduce effectiveness of service delivery.
30.
Heavy reliance on remittances and weak export performance are the main economic
challenges. A broad based expansion of tradable output has not yet taken place and non-tradable
sectors have contributed to most of the growth since the beginning of transition. Despite far
reaching measures to liberalize trade and integrate Albania with the regional and world markets,
private investment, FDI and exports remain among the lowest in the region. Continuing high
trade deficits reflect the poor climate for competitive production and also point to an overreliance on remittances for financing the persistent high current account deficit. While
macroeconomic stability has been maintained, additional efforts are needed to reduce
uncertainties and policy volatility. Public sector performance, and tax administration in
particular, remains weak. This will entail addressing constraints to efficient expenditure
management and prioritization, efficient tax administration and sustaining the steady increase in
tax revenues which started over the past 5 years. And while the current levels of external
indebtedness are moderate, the expected decline in concessional financing and access to
international financial markets may gradually change in the medium term, requiring reforms to
enhance competitiveness, export promotion and addressing risks posed by reliance on
remittances.
31.
Future growth will increasingly rely on higher investment levels. With the recent
slowing of total factor productivity growth from post-transition reallocation, future growth will
have to increasingly rely on increased factor accumulation and sectoral increases in total factor
productivity (as opposed to productivity gains from resource reallocation). Albania’s investment
to GDP ratio declined from 21 percent in 1995 to around 16 percent in 1998. It then picked up
gradually until it peaked in 2001 at about 29 percent. However, the ratio continued to decline in
the last four years until it reached 23.8 percent in 2004. Continued economic stability and
concerted efforts to enhance the investment climate are critical for raising foreign and domestic
investment levels.
32.
Investment and growth prospects in Albania largely hinge on improvements in the
business climate. A weak business environment is undermining future growth prospects as the
private sector is expected to take a more prominent role in ensuring sustainable growth and job
creation. The business environment is plagued with considerable administrative barriers, weak
governance, corruption, ambiguities in property and land rights, poor quality and high cost of

infrastructure and utilities combine to increase the cost of doing business and limit access to
credit and financial services. These constraints represent major barriers for firms to grow despite
improvements in entry/exit regulations.18 In the past few years, with the support from FIAS, the
Government has undertaken a number of measures which has reduced administrative barriers in
2004 compared with 2002. This progress notwithstanding, design flaws, corrupt practices and
harassment in tax and custom collection contribute to unfair competition between firms by
providing incentives for evasion. Instability and poor enforcement of laws and regulations in
most areas of business activity reduce government accountability and increase the scope for
discretion. The information available on regulations is inadequate and of poor quality. An
ineffective competition policy regime contributes to the proliferation of monopolistic behaviors
and unfair practices. Weak capacity of the ex-ante sectoral regulators, delays in establishing
secondary legislation and regulations for the utilities sector, and lack of coordination between
sectoral regulators and the Competition Authority continue to impede the efficient operations of
markets, and reduce the benefits of market liberalization. Albania’s competitiveness also suffers
from a national Metrology, Standardization, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) system that is obsolete
and not in line with the European norms.
33.
Financial intermediation remains weak. Albania has made significant progress towards
the adoption of a market-based economy and almost the entire financial sector is in private
hands. Despite recent increases in bank lending, with a loan-to-GDP ratio of 8.1 percent in 2004,
the level of banking intermediation in Albania remains the lowest in Europe. Although the legal,
institutional and supervisory framework for the financial sector is in line with international
practices, implementation is weak, especially in the insurance sector. Financial intermediation
suffers from a business environment not conducive to robust and sound lending practices. The
poor transparency and management practices and unreliable financial reporting of private
enterprises coupled with uncertainty over property rights hinder secured lending.
34.
Despite recent efforts, difficulties in land tenure and title registration persist. Land
privatization, registration of ownership rights, and urban and coastal land use planning have been
addressed by the Government and donors in a piece-meal fashion. Key laws such as the Law on
Land Restitution and the Law on Legalization of Informal Settlement have been passed during
the last 12 months but implementation is likely to be difficult due to a lack of consultation with
stakeholders and absence of detailed implementation guidelines. Since the completion of a
USAID-financed Land Registration Project, progress in the land registration process has been
slow. While registration of land in rural areas has advanced over the past years, land and
property registration has been particularly slow in valuable urban and coastal areas, resulting in
tedious, costly, and time consuming transactions. Legal and administrative procedures for
resolving ownership disputes are inadequate, contributing to a lack of secure and unambiguous
property rights. The capacity of the Immovable Property Registration Service (IPRS) remains
weak despite progress in reforming it since 1990. There also remains a serious problem in urban
and coastal areas with illegal construction and dubious zoning practices. These factors all
contribute to high transaction costs, inefficient resource use, and a preponderance of informal
land and property markets. They also constitute a major impediment to access to finance.

35.
Poor infrastructure lowers the marginal productivity of private capital in Albania. In
the transport sector, the overall quality of the infrastructure is poor, raising the time and money
costs of transportation, reducing competitiveness and increasing poverty. The identification and
selection of projects in the sector remains non-transparent and in many cases does not reflect
NSSED priorities. Limited capacity, absence of a clear accountability framework in many of the
public institutions within the sector, and insufficient emphasis on maintaining existing transport
networks has resulted in an inappropriate balance between recurrent and capital expenditures.
The responsibilities for managing and maintaining the local road network were decentralized to
the 36 administrative districts, communes and municipalities in 1996, but the capacity, resources
and finances necessary to undertake this role are still inadequate. This has resulted in growing
concerns over road safety in the country. In the energy sector, recurrent power shortages still
represent a pivotal impediment for private sector activity. Inadequate and unreliable electricity
supply continues despite marked improvements in the energy situation, due to the poor stock of
electricity infrastructure (generation, transmission and distribution), over-reliance on
hydropower, and poor cost recovery for electricity supply.
36.
A lack of policy response to rapid urbanization is becoming a major threat to
sustainable development. Albania does not yet have an urban development strategy or plans to
define urban management tasks at the central, regional and local levels. Urban areas suffer from
serious deficiencies in essential infrastructure, causing considerable environmental damage and
decreasing productivity. At the same time, capacity and governance at the municipality level
remains inadequate and results in inefficient use of resources. The challenge is compounded by
emerging large informal settlements around urban areas in the central region and in the coastal
areas, which threatens good tourism potential.
37.
Productivity in the agricultural sector is low. The agricultural sector employed 58
percent of the labor force in 2004. It has high potential for increased productivity, exports and
consequently for reducing rural poverty. Currently, agricultural activities are hampered by farm
fragmentation, limited irrigation services, weak institutions managing water resources, poor
quality of extension services, an overly restrictive regulatory framework for seeds, and poor
market infrastructure. In the fisheries sub-sector, infrastructure is dilapidated and the institutional
framework for the management of fishery resources remains weak, preventing the exploitation of
aquaculture potential and the utilization of fishery resources in a sustainable manner.
38.
Improvements in Albania’s living standards thus require implementation of a
comprehensive reform agenda. The recent Country Economic Memorandum19 concluded that
sustained output growth in Albania would require adoption and implementation of a
comprehensive reforms program based on the following major themes:
•

19

Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, notably through continued adherence to
fiscal discipline, creation of fiscal space while pursing fiscal consolidation, reduction of
debt stock aimed at raising public savings and the quality of public investment. This would
require a focus on efficiency of current and planned spending and priority to recurrent and
maintenance costs of existing infrastructure, and improving revenue mobilization efforts;

Mobilizing human resources, by improving the quality, relevance and access to education,
training and health care and facilitating the movement of labor to more productive and
higher paying jobs;
Boosting trade and accelerating regional and European integration, in order to create a
more favorable environment for FDI and to boost export prospects;
Upgrading public infrastructure, mainly by strengthening allocative efficiency through the
systematic use of economic analysis in the prioritization of expenditures on infrastructure;
price-setting to ensure cost recovery for public infrastructure services; sustained
implementation of the Power Sector Action Plan, and implementation of the national and a
rural water sector strategies; and,
Improving governance and strengthening institutions to ensure managerial integrity
within the public administration; reliable, predictable and fair enforcement of the rule of
law; and building mechanisms that can strengthen good governance by facilitating more
effective ‘voice’ (feedback and monitoring) in service delivery.
Improving Public Service Delivery

39.
The quality of, and access to, social services in Albania lag behind other countries in
the region. Expenditures in the social sectors represented about 45 percent of total budgetary
spending in 2004 (the largest part of the budget), with social protection attracting the largest
share (25 percent), followed by education (10 percent) and health (9 percent). Despite these
allocations, results have fallen below the objectives stated in the NSSED, and expected outcomes
have not materialized. Previous and ongoing sector reviews, point to several shortcomings along
the ‘service delivery production chain’, beginning from government policies and strategies,
down to the translation of policies into budgetary allocations and delivery of services at the local
level.
40.
Labor market outcomes – unemployment and migration – reflect skills mismatch and
education inadequacies. The education system needs to prepare school leavers to effectively
function in labor markets that contribute to strengthening Albania’s competitiveness. With an
average school attainment of 8.5 years, the Albanian population lags substantially behind that of
its neighbors and falls almost 6 years below the OECD average. Low average educational
attainments are compounded by marked variations across regions and income groups. Gross
enrollment rates at the primary and secondary levels declined in the rural and peri-urban areas in
the post-transition period. Albanian students compare unfavorably with their peers in
international achievement tests, pointing to the overall low quality of education. Key challenges
facing the education sector are: (a) poor quality and weak relevance of education; (b) lack of
access to educational establishments, especially in rural areas;20and (c) inadequate sectoral
financing and lack of transparency in the resource allocation and budget execution.21
41.
The Albanian health sector requires fundamental reforms in service delivery,
financing and sectoral governance. The health care system is ill prepared to face the increasing

incidence of non-communicable diseases while also continuing to control infectious diseases.
Physical and human resources are poorly aligned with the population’s health needs, productivity
in the sector is low and resources are used inefficiently. The quality of health service delivery is
low due to the combination of a highly centralized delivery system, weak technical skills,
absence of appropriate governance structures and inadequate provider incentives. Despite recent
progress, the sector continues to be afflicted by deteriorating physical infrastructure due to
reduced spending on operations and maintenance, and, lack of clarity in the process of
investment decision making. Public expenditure on health remains low (2.5 percent of GDP or
US$ 51 per capita/year) by regional and international standards and is highly fragmented, with
frequent shifts in financing responsibilities between central and local governments. Uncertainty
in financing responsibilities provides ample room for abuse. Informal payments have
proliferated, with substantial impact on the poor.22
42.
Coordinated policy reforms across the social insurance system are now critical. The
financial stability of the social insurance system and the coverage and targeting of the social
assistance system require attention. The social protection system absorbs almost one quarter of
public expenditures. Social insurance contribution rates are high compared to other countries in
the region (41.9 percent), which substantially increases labor costs and hampers the
competitiveness of Albanian labor.23 The social insurance system’s fiscal imbalance is driven by
large deficits in the rural pension system, a high dependency ratio and substantial uncertainty
with respect to the contribution base. Despite its deficit, the rural pension system affords limited
financial protection to its beneficiaries. Substantial contribution evasion is likely to lead to a
decline in the pension system’s coverage in the medium to long run. The social insurance
system’s fiscal fragility is further compounded by continuous pressures to reallocate
contributions from social protection towards health insurance, although the capacity does not
exist to assess the fiscal impact of such changes. Reforms of the social insurance system need to
be synchronized with reforms of health financing. The effectiveness of the social assistance
system is constrained by limited coverage, small benefits and ineffective targeting.
43.
Access and quality of water supply and sanitation services are also problematic.
Although 80 percent of Albania’s urban population has access to piped water, supply is
intermittent, and the quality of drinking water is far below internationally accepted standards.
Inadequate maintenance and repairs and the absence of metering and operational control have
resulted in water losses of over 50 percent of water production in cities. Despite recent progress
in decentralization, governance and accountability in the sector remain in flux. The pace of
transfer of water utilities’ assets and management responsibilities to local governments has been
slow, and weak capacities of local governments for planning, implementing and monitoring
performance of water companies constrain improvement in service delivery and quality.24 While
the size of subsidies to water supply and sanitation services remains lower than 1 percent of
GDP, poor cost recovery, combined with the slow pace of reform within the sector could

Unit; Europe and Central Asia Region; the World Bank, Washington D.C.; 29 December 2004.
24
The law assigns responsibility for water and sanitation services as an exclusive function to the local level, making
municipalities and communes responsible for investment and operational decision-making of water and wastewater
services in their jurisdictions. The central government retains responsibility for managing water resources, water
quality, and regulation of water supply and wastewater services (e.g., service standards).
23

increase fiscal risks from arrears accumulation to the electricity company. Tariffs are far below
cost recovery levels and are not based on metered consumption, encouraging thus overconsumption. While most of the 52 utilities are running operational losses, the current subsidy
system does not reward well-performing utilities and therefore does not make the most efficient
use of scarce resources. Poor households are generally not connected to the water network and
therefore do not benefit from subsidies to the sector. The situation in rural areas is worse: access
to piped water supply has decreased from 75 percent in 1989 to 50 percent today, and areas
without piped supply often rely on heavily contaminated sources.

V. WORLD BANK GROUP’S CURRENT PORTFOLIO
A.

Past Bank Assistance and Quality and Management of the Existing Portfolio

44.
The World Bank Group partnership with Albania has continued to strengthen. The
WBG is the second largest donor to Albania after the EU. Since Albania joined the World Bank
in 1991, IDA commitments to the country through 57 operations total approximately US$ 820
million; IFC commitments have reached US$ 125 million, while MIGA’s net exposure totaled
US$ 8.6 million. The WBG assistance to Albania during FY02-FY05 has been evaluated as
satisfactory (see Annex 2 on the CAS Completion Report, Annex 3 and 4 on IFC and MIGA
support program respectively). The proposed strategy both builds on the lessons of the previous
CAS and relies on the existing portfolio of 15 projects to achieve the expected outcomes and
results in the next four years.
45.
The quality of IDA’s current portfolio in Albania continues to improve. The portfolio
has witnessed significant consolidation with the decline in the number of projects from 25 in
FY02 to 15 by the end of FY05. Currently the portfolio does not contain any problem project and
none of the projects is at risk (Table 3). For projects exiting between FY97 and FY04, OED rated
89 percent of the project outcomes (by value) as satisfactory; 47 percent had substantial
institutional development impact and 77 percent were considered to have likely sustainability.

From FY05, capacity is being mainstreamed with all new projects designed to be
implemented through existing government structures. As highlighted by the recent OED CAE
and the CAS Completion Report (Annex 1), the implementation of projects through Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) has reduced the potential impact of projects on institutional

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

development and sustainability. An agreement was reached with the Government in late FY04 to
implement, to the maximum extent possible, all new projects inside existing government
structures. A key change is that a project authorizing person from government (at level of
Director, Director General or Deputy Minister) is now assigned to oversee the implementation of
each project. When necessary skills are lacking in the public administration, they will be
externally contracted to assist in the project implementation (e.g., financial management,
procurement, etc). Such expertise, however, will report to the project authorizing person and the
concerned government agency or ministry.
B.

Albania’s Country Financing Parameters (CFPs)

47.
Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Albania were established in March 2005
after consultation with the Government (see Annex 7).25 The CFPs for Albania provide for
added flexibility in allowing Bank financing of up to 100 percent of project costs, although the
level of Bank financing will be considered on a case by case basis. In aggregate it is expected
that past financing patterns would continue broadly unchanged. The CFPs also allow recurrent
cost financing on a selective basis, and Bank financing of local and foreign costs in any
proportion. The CFP will greatly facilitate Bank operations in Albania and reduce the transaction
costs of implementing Bank financed projects by allowing the avoidance of the complex regime
for ensuring taxes and duties are not paid that has hitherto created major difficulties. The
additional flexibility will support project implementation and is fully consistent with the
approach of the CAS in emphasizing Government ownership of the underlying project
objectives. The maximum flexibility allowed by the CFPs will nonetheless be applied
selectively, in reflection of the different levels of mutual agreement on sector reforms and
approaches across different areas, and with due regard to sustainability and fiduciary oversight.

VI. THE WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A.

Key Features and Pillars of the Results Based Assistance Strategy

48.
The WBG will support Albania in its efforts to meet its development objectives through
various instruments. The proposed program is based on the NSSED, the priorities of the
European integration and the SAp, the program of the new Government approved by Parliament
in September 2005, and the results of consultations with the Government and other stakeholders.
The CAS aims to support the Government around two core pillars: (i) continued economic
growth through support to private sector development; and (ii) improved public service delivery.
Improving governance and strengthening accountability mechanisms will be the main crosscutting objective and thematic focus of the entire support program which includes investment
projects, a series of programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs),26 and a focused program
of analytical support.

25

Pursuant to the Bank’s policy on financing for investment projects (OP/BP 6.00, Bank Financing).
While it is intended that the first two of the series would be IDA-financed Development Policy Credits, the
Bank’s planned programmatic support is referred to collectively as Development Policy Loans (DPL) throughout
this document.

26

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(i) Mainstreaming Governance
49.
A ‘Governance Filter’ has been developed to ensure that the Bank consistently takes
all opportunities to improve governance. In conjunction with the Results Matrix, the Bank will
use four guiding principles to ensure governance considerations are mainstreamed into all its
interventions in Albania:
Principle I: Seek greater transparency in the use of public resources. This principle implies
the need to work on strengthening the lines of accountability, improving transparency and
participation in resource allocation and enabling better access to information by all
stakeholders. Specific attention needs to be given to the functioning of oversight bodies, to
procurement, to internal and external audit, to transparent financial reporting, to publicprivate partnerships, and to the functioning of integrated planning and budgeting processes
and their execution by government. In all WBG efforts, explicit attention will be paid to how
well the annual and medium–term budget allocations are aligned with NSSED priorities and
the transparency in the allocations and use of resources and project selection.
Principle II: Support increased autonomy and de-politicization of key public sector
counterpart organizations. Delineation between the political and administrative spheres in
government is vital for improved public sector performance and the creation of a professional
administration. Checks and balances between political and administrative institutions need to
be effective. The Bank’s strategy to date of supporting initial civil service reform on a small
scale has proven to be effective. These results need to be safeguarded and the practices of a
merit-based bureaucracy need to be expanded to encompass a larger numbers of officials
with direct involvement in service delivery, in particular in line ministries and in local
governments.
Principle III: Analyze the formal (and likely future) roles of local governments, and
develop capacity -- and local mechanisms of accountability -- to enable local governments
to effectively take on these roles. Local government needs to play a central role to improve
service delivery, and there are opportunities to improve governance by strengthening local
government. Albania has made progress in laying the foundations for decentralization and
ongoing reform at the central level and in sectors will be implemented at the local
government level in the next four years. Implementation of these reforms needs to be
accompanied by a solid understanding of the constraints faced at this level of government.
Principle IV: Strengthen mechanisms for advocacy and increased involvement of citizens
(including nongovernmental stakeholders) to encourage improved performance of public
service delivery and policy-making bodies. ‘Voice and accountability’ is a dimension of
governance in which Albania performs well. There is a vibrant civil society and press, as
well as demand and opportunity to express and discuss views publicly. The existing
mechanisms need to be harnessed and strengthened by empowering communities, especially
in service areas such as the management of schools and service delivery by hospitals.
Strengthened stakeholder involvement is required as a corollary to decentralization.

BOX 3: STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE IN THE BANK PORTFOLIO
With significant concerns about weak governance in Albania and increased perceptions of corruption in recent
surveys and public opinion polls, the World Bank Group is taking steps to improve monitoring and strengthen
governance in its own portfolio. The following mitigation measures will be reinforced and enhanced during the
implementation of the CAS to minimize such risks:
A. Existing Measures to Minimize Corruption Risks in the Bank Portfolio:
(i) Decentralization of more functions and responsibilities to the Country Office particularly in portfolio
management (with gradual building of capacity in procurement and financial management).
(ii) Continuous support to the auditing, procurement, supervisory and regulatory agencies.
(iii) Continuous support to the demand side of governance and citizen-based mechanisms of transparency and
accountability through CDD approaches and involvement of beneficiaries in development planning and the
design, implementation and supervision of projects (e.g., irrigation, fisheries, public works, etc.).
(iv) Assistance to the Government to institutionalize and scale-up the positive lessons from successful pilot
projects that aim to enhance governance (e.g., Tirana Transparency Project) into more sectors and agencies.
(v) Vigorous investigation and follow-up to any allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank projects through
Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) and public disclosure of the results (e.g., debarment of
individuals and companies in 2005 with regard to fraudulent practices in the Water Supply Urgent
Rehabilitation Project).
(vi) Capacity and risk assessments for each project at appraisal are undertaken to determine appropriate
procurement thresholds for prior review. Action plans are prepared to build capacity of the implementing
agencies during project implementation and subject to improvements, prior review thresholds may be
increased. Extensive post reviews are conducted by procurement staff to ensure compliance.
B. New Measures to be implemented during the CAS Period to Minimize Corruption Risks:
(i) Diligent and consistent application of the “Governance Filter” and its four principles in all new programs.
(ii) Consolidation of the portfolio by reducing the number of projects and increasing resources for supervision
to ensure increased attention to fiduciary, procurement and financial management aspects of lending.
(iii) Close linkages between the AAA program (particularly the Programmatic PER and Poverty Assessment)
and lending support to ensure adequate attention to the efficient and transparent use of public resources and
monitoring and evaluation of outcomes.
(iv) Discontinue further support to sectors or agencies that do not make satisfactory progress towards necessary
reforms and remedial measures.
(v) Frequent use of pre-emptive audits and joint Government-Bank portfolio reviews.
(vi) Increase the assistance to implementing agencies particularly in the case of difficult (e.g., complex
technical specifications, multiple stage bidding) and significant (e.g., multiple packages, high value
contracts) tenders. The evaluation committee could be assisted by international experts in the relevant field
(possibly selected and/or funded by the Bank) in their review and recommendations for award.
(vii) Implementation of the revised procurement guidelines which promote greater transparency in the bidding
process by application of new disclosure policy on contract awards.

50.
The entire WBG support program will address governance weaknesses. The use of the
four principles of the ‘Governance Filter’ will underpin the design of the projects, the substance
of AAA support, the reform agenda to be supported by the DPL, and the supervision, monitoring
and implementation of projects (Box 3). In addition, new projects will build on the existing
project portfolio to continue the support to the core public sector systems at the central levels.
The Public Administration Reform Project (FY00) will continue to strengthen public
administration, policy planning and efficient management of public resources. It will be
supplemented by the Business Environment Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project
(FY06), DPLs (FY07-FY09), programmatic PER (FY07-FY09), CPAR/CFAA (FY06 and
FY09) and the IDF grant for the support of the decentralization process.27 The Bank will

encourage the Government to build on the positive lessons from Participatory Budgeting Pilot
initiatives (FY04) to encourage active participation of citizens in the local budget process as well
as in overall planning, execution and monitoring of the use of public resources. The Bank will
also strengthen its partnership with other leading development partners (see Annexes 1 and 7)
that are supporting key public sector reforms (e.g., public procurement, tax and custom
administration, civil service reforms, rule of law and public expenditure management).28
51.
To ensure the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts, the WBG support program will
continue to focus on inclusive development and reduction of regional disparities.29 The
specific vulnerable groups (including the poorest, the Roma, youth, and vulnerable women) will
receive special attention in the design and implementation of the new projects, through social
analysis, inclusive operational arrangements and appropriate monitoring and evaluation. The
Bank has developed some innovative approaches in supporting Community Driven Development
(CDD) in many of its investment projects (e.g., microcredit, irrigation, drainage, fisheries, and
small local infrastructure) that rely on establishing beneficiary associations to manage projects
and resources. The use of these bottom-up approaches will be expanded to other sectors and in
new projects wherever feasible.
(ii) Pillar I: Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development
52.
Sustained growth of the Albanian economy is predicated on maintaining
macroeconomic stability, improving the investment climate, and raising exports and
productivity levels. The WBG support program, under this pillar, will aim to: (i) maintain
macroeconomic stability and ensure the efficient use of resources; (ii) strengthen financial
intermediation and support the privatization of strategic companies; (iii) enhance the business
climate by removing administrative and regulatory barriers to investment and building an
effective competition policy regime; (iv) establish a functioning land market and institutions; (v)
build the infrastructure necessary for growth; (vi) improve management of the coastal zone; and
(vii) raise agricultural productivity.
53.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Future macroeconomic stability will be critically
dependent on pursuing structural and institutional reforms with particular emphasis on fiscal and
external sustainability. The Bank will support measures for enhancing stability and the quality of
fiscal adjustment through a proposed program of DPL support through FY07-FY09 and a
programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PER). On the expenditure side, reductions in both
current (notably operations and maintenance) and capital spending, which have been the main
lever for reducing the overall budget deficit since 1998, need to be assessed and reversed to
increase productivity of capital investments. Expenditures on priority areas, as identified by the
responsibilities attributed to local governments; (ii) estimation of the local own revenues capacity and the tax effort;
(iii) regulated access of local government to borrowing for local infra-structure investment; (iv) consistent design of
a transfer system which factors in national tax-sharing; and (v) drafting Local Government Finance Law.
28
See Annex 1 for the CAS Results and partnerships towards achieving the CAS outcomes. In particular close
coordination with the IMF, EU, USAID, DFID and UNDP is envisaged.
29
The Second Community Works (FY04), the Water Resources Management (FY04) and the Natural Resources
Management (FY05) projects cover or have a focus on the northern areas. The planned projects in health, education,
transport and the GEF Lake Shkodra projects during FY06-FY09 will have special focus on Mountain region and
other areas with high incidence of poverty.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

23

NSSED, should also be sustained. The programmatic PER will support building robust
institutional arrangements for the analysis and evaluation of public investment projects. Support
to improving the business environment through the Business Environment Enhancement and
Institutional Reform Project (FY06) will also contribute to increased export competitiveness and
attract FDI. IFC has also identified the promotion of external competitiveness through support to
local export-oriented and import-substitution companies as a high priority for its support. MIGA
will be available to support investments in the agribusiness, manufacturing and tourism sectors,
which are most likely to attract increasing levels of FDI inflows.
54.
Strengthening financial intermediation and finalizing the privatization of strategic
companies. The WBG will assist the Government in the completion of the financial sector
reform agenda and support the implementation of the recommendations of the recently
concluded Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).30 The Business Environment
Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project (FY06) in conjunction with the DPL will support
policy measures associated with financial sector development, including: (i) strengthening
governance of banks and insurance companies; (ii) adoption of a legal, institutional and
supervisory framework enabling sound development of the insurance sector; (iii) strengthening
banking supervision and exit mechanisms for credit institutions; (iv) adoption and
implementation of an EU-compatible legal and institutional framework for accounting and
auditing; (v) strengthening enforcement of the collateral regime; and (vi) efficient and
transparent completion of the privatization program. An Access to Credit Review (FY07) will
assess progress towards those objectives and inform the design of the DPL II and DPL III (FY08
and FY09). IFC will continue its technical assistance and financial support to the financial sector
particularly to financing of SMEs, introduction of new financial products (e.g., leasing, factoring,
etc.), and privatization of the remaining state holdings in insurance. MIGA would also consider
supporting projects in the financial sector which are expected to result in improved SMEs’ access
to finance.
55.
Enhancing the business climate. The WBG will use a combination of instruments to
support improvements in the business climate, removal of administrative and regulatory barriers
to investment and building an effective competition policy regime. These include the Business
Environment Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project (FY06) and the DPL program, an
Accounting and Auditing ROSC (FY06), and IFC/FIAS technical assistance.31 The interventions
aim to support the: (i) design and implementation of a comprehensive approach to regulatory
reforms enabling systematic improvement of quality of business sector and consultation
mechanisms with the business community; (ii) strengthening the MSTQ system infrastructure;
and (iii) strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for EU-oriented competition
and industrial policies. An Investment Climate Assessment (FY08) will be undertaken to assess
the effectiveness of these interventions on the business climate. In close cooperation with the
Bank, IFC will facilitate privatization of strategic sectors and will provide technical assistance
and advisory services aimed at improving the investment climate and advising on strategic
privatizations. MIGA’s European Investor Outreach Program (EIOP) aims to encourage higher
investment flows into Albania and other Western Balkan countries (Annex 4).

56.
Improving security of land tenure and establishing a functioning land market. The
Bank has begun to assist the Government to develop a coherent and consistent framework for
addressing land management through the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and
Clean-up APL (FY05) and a Land Policy Note (FY05). The ICZM project focuses on policy and
institutional reform, and finances priority regional infrastructure and provision of public services
in southern coastal villages. The second phase of this APL project (FY09) would aim to foster
regulated and sustainable tourism development in hinterland areas on the Albanian coast. It will
place more emphasis on infrastructure investments (e.g., solid waste, wastewater, roads, water
supply, and typical tourist infrastructure) as well as on promoting protected areas management in
coastline and marine ecosystems and reducing health risks associated with additional coastal
polluting hot-spots. The project will also include a youth employment component particularly in
the tourism sector to address the large youth unemployment rate. The second phase will be
coordinated closely with the proposed Land Management and Urban Development Project
(FY07). This project, which will be informed by an Urban Development Strategy (FY06), will
assist in the development of an overall land administration and management strategy and an
implementation plan to improve land tenure security. It will accelerate the title registration
process, especially in the urban and coastal areas, and will also build on the reforms supported by
the Agricultural Services Project (FY00) to reduce the costs of registering property transactions.
32

A number of projects are identified as high priority in FY09. These include a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation;
a support to Decentralization and Local Government, a Social Insurance Reform project, an Agricultural
Competitiveness or a second Energy project. The CASPR FY08 will define the nature and context of this project.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

25

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The project will also directly target urban and suburban growth centers and work directly with
local governments towards improving governance and service delivery in secondary cities.
57.
Building the infrastructure necessary for growth. Constrained availability of financing
for infrastructure (fiscal space) and modest institutional reform progress remain as bottlenecks to
growth and private sector development. The WBG will support the provision and maintenance of
reliable and efficient transport infrastructure through a number of interventions. An Urban
Transport Study (FY07) will precede the proposed Transport project (FY08) which will aim to
reduce transport costs, improve traffic flow and contribute to an improvement in road safety on
the priority corridor(s) identified by the new Government, such the Durres-Kukes-Morine road.
The new Government aims to improve access to the impoverished northeastern part of the
country, to alleviate poverty, to integrate the region with the rest of the country and the wider
region, and to facilitate trade with neighboring countries. A Rural Infrastructure Study (FY08)
will inform policy and strategy development in the context of sustainable and affordable rural
infrastructure services, with a primary emphasis on the local road network. In the energy sector,
the current portfolio already comprises three operations that aim to improve electricity
generation, transmission and distribution.33 A second Energy Community of South Eastern
Europe (ECSEE) APL project for Albania (FY08) would further support Albania's participation
in ECSEE, thereby providing additional impetus to sector restructuring. The project will include
technical assistance aimed at continuing successful efforts at capacity building to date and
improving governance in the sector.34
58.
IFC and MIGA will work closely with the Government and the Bank to attract private
sector financing in the infrastructure sectors. IFC’s will focus on promoting private sector
investments through public-private partnership (PPP) in power, transport, and water and
sanitation sectors (see Annex 3). IFC and the Bank plan a joint comprehensive approach to
transparency and competition policy in infrastructure including close coordination between the
regulators and the anti-monopoly authority. In cooperation with a number of donors, IFC has
established the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) to help public sector
entities in Western Balkans, including Albania, attract private investment, particularly in energy,
transport and water and sanitation. To support regional integration, IFC will facilitate private
sector involvement in port and pipeline projects. MIGA will also assist foreign investors seeking
to begin or expand operations in Albania, particularly in the infrastructure sectors through the
provision of sovereign and sub-sovereign political risk guarantees (Annex 4).
59.
Raising agricultural productivity. The existing Bank portfolio consists of several
projects that aim to support rural development, expansion of agricultural value-added and natural
resources management. They build on innovative bottom-up CDD approaches that have focused
on establishing water users association (WUAs) and fishery management organization (FMOs).
The Agricultural Services Project (FY00) supports land consolidation, seeds, extension and
technological improvements, and establishment of wholesale markets. The Water Resources
Management Project (FY04) aims to complete the rehabilitation of all irrigation and drainage
33

The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring (FY02), Power Sector Generation and Restructuring (FY04),
and ECSEE APL2-Albania (FY05) projects.
34
An IBRD guarantee or IBRD loan (under established guidelines, both as part of the overall CAS envelope) for the
second stage a thermal power plant will be considered in the CASPR (FY08). The guarantee operation would aim to
support private investment for additional thermal units.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

infrastructure in the country following the completion of two prior successful projects, and to
improve institutional and regulatory reforms for water resources management. The Natural
Resources Management project (FY05) aims to establish and maintain sustainable, communitybased natural resource management in 218 communes in erosion-prone upland and mountainous
lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from sustainable resource
management, reduced soil degradation, improved water management, conservation of
biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these resources. Finally, an
Agricultural Export and Competitiveness Study (FY07) is planned to inform the DPL program
and ensure support to raising agricultural productivity.

(iii) Pillar II: Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors
60.
Improved service delivery is critical for fostering human capital formation, poverty
reduction efforts and for Albania to meet its MDGs. The Government of Albania has an
ambitious program to improve service delivery in the social sectors through concerted reforms in
the education, health and social welfare systems as well as in the provision of public utilities.
Through the DPL program, social sector investment projects and AAA support (including
programmatic PER and poverty assessments and an IDF grant for the support of
decentralization), the Bank will support evidence-based policy making, to enhance pro-poor

35

The World Bank Institute (WBI) will also support the WBG program in Albania during FY07-FY09 when the
global and regional programs will be finalized. Albania is currently not a WBI focus country.

allocation of public resources and improve the targeting of social assistance and delivery of
public education and health services, particularly at the local levels.
61.
The Government aims to shift from a centralized and supply driven education system to
a demand-based system with increased levels of accountability. This shift will be supported by
the Education Excellence and Equity Project (FY06) which aims to address equity and quality of
education in Albania. Responsibility for delivery of pre-university education will gradually shift
to local Governments and schools as the ultimate service delivery units. This will be facilitated
by the introduction of a performance-based management system (initially in the Ministry of
Education with subsequent expansion to local governments and schools), a shift from inputbased to formula-based financing of pre-university education, a system of performance
monitoring and benchmarking at the school, regional and national levels, continued publication
of the national education system score card, establishment of school maintenance standards, and
expansion of the education information system. Capacity in school management and oversight
will also be strengthened through the establishment of school boards, which will work with local
communities. Schools will be granted increased autonomy to adapt curricula to local needs and
to choose among alternative teaching materials, as well as greater freedom to use own locally
raised resources. A far reaching curriculum and textbook reform has also been initiated and a
revised basic education curriculum will be completed by 2010 (and of secondary education by
2015). Efforts to improve the quality of teaching include the development of competencies for
teachers, a teacher accreditation system and introduction of an in-service training program.
Reforms in basic education will need also to be complemented with efforts to improve the
quality and relevance of secondary and tertiary education. The education project will be
supported by the DPL program and the programmatic PER and Poverty Assessments, and a
Secondary/Tertiary Education Policy Note (FY07).
62.
The Health System Modernization Project (FY06) will support strengthening of the
technical competency of medical staff, sectoral financing, and performance monitoring.
Medical skills will be enhanced through the introduction of systems for continuous medical
education and re-licensing for medical personnel, development of clinical practice guidelines and
substantial changes to the sectoral governance structure. Sectoral financing will shift from the
current input-based system to a performance-based provider payment system, with measures to
enhance lower income groups’ access to health care, and will be streamlined to pass through one
financing agent. Providers will gradually be granted more autonomy and enter into direct
contractual relationships with the health financing agency. A system of regular sectoral
performance monitoring, with public discussion of sectoral achievements will be established.
The Government will also be assisted to improve its resource allocation mechanisms through the
development of a health map and the adoption of a national hospital services development plan.
To assess the evolution in access to care, a health sector access analysis will be carried out as
part of the Programmatic Poverty Assessment (FY06-FY09). Progress in effectiveness of service
delivery and governance will be assessed as part of the proposed AAA on Governance and
Accountability in Social Sector Services Delivery (FY08). Policy reforms in the areas of health
finance and governance will also be supported under the proposed programmatic DPL series.
Additional opportunities to explore private sector participation in the health sector will also be
explored. The government has also initiated a dialogue with IFC to explore such opportunities.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

63.
Reforms to the social insurance system are being designed to improve the fiscal
sustainability of the system, while allowing a reduction in payroll tax contributions. The latter
will be an important element in improving the competitiveness of Albania’s labor market. The
Government will continue to develop the capacity of the Social Insurance Institute (SII) to model
medium- and long-term impacts of policy changes on fiscal sustainability of the pension system
and the larger social insurance system, and begin to implement a medium-term pension policy
reform program. With regard to social assistance, the highest priority is the establishment of an
improved accountability framework for the delivery of social assistance schemes by local
governments. Areas which require attention include the need to: (i) establish service standards
and a monitoring and evaluation system for social assistance and social care services provided by
local governments; (ii) improve targeting and expand coverage of the cash social assistance
system in a fiscally affordable manner; (iii) strengthen the effectiveness of the cash disability
benefits system; (iv) evaluate the potential for linkages between cash social assistance and
subsidies for basic services such as utilities and health care and; (v) support the decentralization
and deinstitutionalization of social care services. The Bank will support the Government’s efforts
through a Social Insurance Finance Review (FY07) to cover unemployment, pensions, health and
other parts of the social insurance system. Policy changes on the social insurance finance front
will be supported through the proposed DPL program (FY07-FY09). The Bank is also supporting
the Government’s efforts to strengthen delivery of social care services at local levels through the
ongoing Social Services Development Project (FY01) which aims to improve access and quality
of social care services in a cost effective manner by local Governments.
64.
The Bank will support improvements in the provision of water supply and sanitation
services in both urban and rural areas. The Bank will support the implementation of the Rural
Water Supply Strategy, and will also continue to support the provision of improved water supply
and sanitation services in urban areas through the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project
(FY03), the Integrated Water and Ecosystem Management Project (FY04), and the Community
Works II Project (FY03). In addition, the new ICZM APL phases I and II (FY05 and FY08) will
finance priority investments including water and sanitation infrastructure as earlier described.
IFC will explore ways to approach municipal financing also through public-private partnership to
attract private operators with a focus on the city of Tirana.
B.

The Framework for Bank Assistance and Financing Scenarios

65.
The CAS proposes a lending range, with actual lending to be determined by the pace of
reform in key sectors. This design reflects the reality that discrete lending ‘cases’ defined by
hard triggers often do not allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate different rates of progress
across sectors. A lending range of US$ 75 – US$ 196 million is envisaged, with actual lending to
be determined according to progress in achieving key milestones outlined in the monitoring
framework (Table 6). The proposed lending program would be financed by a blend of IDA and
IBRD resources, with gradual transition from IDA to IBRD beginning in FY06. Albania’s
exceptional and temporary eligibility for IDA resources on modified terms has been extended
through FY06-FY0836 with an indicative envelope of up to US$ 86 million.37 IDA lending is
36

Through IDA13 Albania had access to IDA resources despite its GNP per capita exceeding the IDA operational
cut off due to its lack of creditworthiness for IBRD lending. Albania will graduate from IDA support by the end of
IDA14.
37
Annual allocations will be determined through the Performance-Based Allocation system.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

29

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

planned to be front-loaded to allow a smooth transition to IBRD throughout the CAS period (on
a commitment basis).38 An assessment conducted in FY05 concluded that Albania is
creditworthy for limited IBRD lending, with a first IBRD financed (or blend) operation planned
for FY06. With strong performance and consistent implementation of the reform agenda, Albania
is expected to benefit from up to US$ 110 million of IBRD lending, and should fully graduate to
IBRD-only support in FY09.
66.
Key milestones will be used as a core monitoring framework against which progress
would be collectively assessed for base lending or moving to the higher lending range. The
envisaged lending support assumes strong policy performance in critical areas (Table 6).
Progress in undertaking the necessary reforms would be collectively assessed (as opposed to
each milestone being a hard ‘trigger’). Development policy support targeting private sector
development, public sector and institutional reform, and improved service delivery in key social
and infrastructure sectors forms the core of the program. For the DPL program to proceed as
planned in FY07, remaining weaknesses in the privatization, concession, and public procurement
frameworks will need to be addressed satisfactorily in FY06, inter alia, to ensure appropriate
treatment of unsolicited proposals for private provision of infrastructure, especially those that are
not consistent with the NSSED/MTBP framework. The Business Environment Enhancement and
Institutional Reform project (FY06) is planned to assist in addressing these weaknesses.
67.
Enhanced IBRD creditworthiness is required for high lending support levels. Although
recent economic growth and inflation trends have been encouraging, incremental measures are
needed to maintain fiscal and external sustainability. External indebtedness is currently
moderate, but the conditions that resulted in that outcome, a combination of concessional
financing and lack of access to the international financial markets, will be gradually changing in
the medium term, and continuous vigilance is required, particularly since both the fiscal deficit
and the current account deficit remain relatively large. In addition, the prevailing weaknesses in
governance, weak revenue mobilization efforts, pervasive poverty, and the combination of heavy
dependence on remittances and a narrow and undiversified export base, will continue to pose
development challenges, necessitating continuous close monitoring of Albania’s
creditworthiness.
68. Lending levels in the last two years of the CAS will be assessed in the FY08 CASPR. The
mid-term CAS Progress Report (CASPR FY08), which will assess performance against CAS
results, will also review the milestones for enhanced lending and IBRD creditworthiness. The
outcomes and milestones in Table 6 would be used to assess the structure of the lending program
as events warrant. Higher lending levels, to be implemented by augmenting the size of planned
operations within the lending envelope contemplated in Table 4,39 would require the
implementation of a clearly identified reform agenda that raises the long term growth potential of
the country and markedly improved governance. GDP growth prospects will critically depend on
a demonstrated increase in private sector investment accompanied by a broadening of the narrow
export base. Sustained improvements in governance, public sector management, procurement
and financial management would also be required. Should the pace of reform implementation

slow, as adjudged against the milestones outlined in Table 6, the proposed DPL program and
associated infrastructure investments would be delayed resulting in slippage of operations from
this CAS to the next, which would imply lending towards the lower end of the support program
(US$ 75 million). In the unlikely event that policy reversals result in the macroeconomic
framework (as outlined in this document) going off track, the Bank would as justified move
forward only with two social sector projects planned in FY06 and annual lending of about US$
15 million in subsequent years (all IDA) for social sector and social assistance support and an
updated approach would be prepared in the CASPR.

Assistance Finance Review (FY06), the Private Sector Development Policy Note (FY05), the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FY05), the Land Policy Note (FY05), and the Health
Sector Note (FY05). It is anticipated that each DPL would focus on the core principal themes of
the CAS to provide continuity of reform actions across the program.
70.
The First DPL. DPL I (FY07) is intended to dovetail with FY06 investment projects and
the existing portfolio and target further progress in governance and public sector reforms. It will
support reforms to improve the overall efficiency of public sector expenditures, make public
administration more effective, and further advance the decentralization agenda. It will assist the
Government in revising the public procurement framework to plug the loopholes that allow
unsolicited and non-transparent bids. It will help to improve capacity to prioritize public
investment projects, including through development of an action plan to implement the IPS that
aligns different policy frameworks. It will address the issue of professionalism of public
administration by seeking an expansion of coverage of the Civil Service Law and begin
implementation of pay reform. DPL I will also maintain the PRSCs’ momentum on
decentralization, including developing capacity and mechanisms of accountability at the local
level.
71.
The Second DPL. DPL II (FY08) is intended to continue the support for improvements
in governance, public sector performance, public expenditure management and decentralization.
In addition to these core reforms, DPL II will support government efforts that would improve
social service delivery. In education, the focus would be on implementation of the education
sector decentralization strategy. In health, the DPL would support implementation of a new
system of financing, managing and governing health care delivery. In social protection, reforms
would aim at further improving the fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and
ensuring adequate targeting of social assistance benefits.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

32

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

72.
The Third DPL. DPL III (FY09) would also assist the Government to implement reforms
to enhance governance, public sector reforms and improvements in service delivery. It will focus
on the attractiveness of Albania as a destination for domestic and foreign investment through the
strengthening of administrative capacity to improve the quality of the regulatory framework for
business entry and operations, continued development of the land market, and improving the
regulatory and institutional frameworks for the implementation of an effective competition
policy regime. DPL III, which will be informed by an Access to Credit Review (FY07) and an
Investment Climate Assessment (FY08), will consolidate progress made in reforming the
financial sector by further strengthening the legal and supervisory frameworks and strengthening
the corporate governance of financial sector institutions. Further, it will support implementation
of the financial reporting according to the new accounting law as well as the implementation of
International Standards on Auditing (ISA) for the financial and non-financial sectors. A decision
to proceed with DPL III would be made in the CASPR (FY08). Key benchmarks underpinning
this decision will be the satisfactory implementation of public procurement, concessions and
privatization legislation to be undertaken in FY06 and the satisfactory implementation of
governance reforms (see Table 6 and Annex 1). DPL III is expected to be on IBRD terms.
D.

Regional Dimensions of the Support Strategy

73.
The CAS aims to strengthen Albania’s prospects for EU Accession by supporting key
aspects of the SAp, the NSSED and the IPS. Albania is committed to advance its integration in
the SEE region and in the EU, and has signed FTAs with all its neighboring countries. It has also
been actively engaged in a number of regional initiatives and programs (e.g., the Stability Pact,
the Infrastructure Steering Committee in SEE (ISG), and the ECSEE). The support program of
the CAS aims to further Albania’s integration in regional trade and investment as key dimensions
for enhancing private sector and economic growth. A number of programs and projects have a
regional perspective, particularly in energy, transport, water resources management and
environment. The current portfolio has an energy regional project (ECSEE- Albania APL2) and a
new regional energy project is planned in FY08. The transport project (FY08) will also aim
mainly to link the northeastern region of Albania with neighboring countries, building on the
successful implementation of the regional Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeastern
Europe Project (TTFSE). The planned AAA program also supports regional integration and
dimensions. For example, the Country Economic Memorandum in FY08 will review Albania’s
EU accession agenda, and a regional Growth and Competitiveness study is planned to support
prospects for increasing trade and investment flows towards and within the region.
E.

Partnerships and Participation

74.
Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CAS (Annex 5). The
country office has embarked on consultations with all stakeholders since late 2004. A CAS
government counterpart team was formed to guide the preparation of the strategy. The
Government consultations concluded in a joint retreat with the new Government on 12
September 2005. Consultations with parliamentary commissions and groups enabled the team to
assess the national priorities as presented by representatives of all political parties. Two
workshops were organized in north Albania (Kukes) and south Albania (Fier) for representatives
of local governments and civil society organizations in the respective regions. An advisory
committee from civil society organizations has advised the Bank’s team throughout the

preparation process. Two rounds of consultations with private sector representatives were also
organized, and an Open House for Youth in March 2005 was held to examine youth priorities
and their expectations for the new CAS. Two rounds of consultations were organized for donors
focusing on the CAS priorities and donor coordination. A Client Assessment Survey was
undertaken in December 2004 (see CASCR) and a special CAS Electronic Discussion Forum has
been established to ensure wider participation of all stakeholders in the CAS preparation.
75.
The Country Office will continue to expand its outreach to strengthen partnerships in
the implementation of the new CAS. A communication strategy for the Country Office has been
formulated to expand and enhance the Bank’s outreach activities. A partnership agreement
between the Bank and the Faculty of Economics (University of Tirana) resulted in the transfer of
the Public Information Center (PIC) to the Faculty’s library in March 2005. In its new location,
the PIC will be the venue for launching most of the Bank AAA dissemination and other related
activities. A quarterly newsletter is now published and disseminated by the Country office and
efforts are underway to strengthen links with the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN).
Furthermore, the Bank will continue to support civil society organizations through the Small
Grants Program.
76.
Emphasis on selectivity in the CAS support program relies on strong partnerships with
other development partners. First, a satisfactory macroeconomic framework underpins the
Bank’s program. The Bank and the IMF cooperate closely in these areas.40 Second, close
coordination with the European Commission (EC), UNDP, and OSCE (which together with the
Bank have shared responsibility with regard to donor coordination) will be enhanced to support
the Government’s implementation of the IPS. Third, the Bank also intends to increase its
coordination with the EC to facilitate European integration which is the overarching long-term
vision in Albania. To this end, the Bank program is synchronized with the EC CARDS program
which will lead donor efforts in a number of important areas such as judicial reforms, fight
against organized crime, trade, customs and taxation (Annex 9). Fourth, the Bank will also
continue to work closely with EBRD, EIB, IsDB, OPEC Fund, and Kuwait Fund in co-financing
projects and programs (particularly in infrastructure and private sector development). Finally, the
Bank also intends to reinforce and strengthen its partnerships and coordination with bilateral
donor, including, among others, the Italian Cooperation, The Netherlands, USAID, GTZ, DFID,
SNV, SIDA, Swiss Cooperation, and Austrian Cooperation. Under the newly implemented donor
architecture the Bank will continue to provide support to 9 thematic groups in the areas of social
and economic development.
77.
Joint Analytical and Advisory Services. The Bank will continue to prepare its economic
sector work (ESW) in partnership with the concerned government agencies. In FY05, the Bank
has started the preparation of AAA activities (e.g., the Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review) in partnership with other development partners. Efforts will be made to foster this joint
approach in the provision of technical assistance and policy advice to the Government to ensure
better harmonization among donor approaches and sustained capacity building in concerned
government agencies.

40

Agreement on a new three-year IMF PRGF-EFF program has been reached between the Government of Albania
and the IMF on November 21, 2005. IMF Board discussion of the new program is scheduled for early 2006.

VII. RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION
78.
The measurement of results is an essential component of improving accountability.
Box 5 aggregates the major results and outcomes to be influenced by the Bank and achieved by
the Government during the CAS period, and Annex 1 provides the details of the results and
outcomes expected from the various interventions. The Bank will primarily depend on
government systems and agencies for the compilation and verification of results and milestones.
A Statistical Master Plan (SMP) will be developed in an effort to raise statistical capacity
building, in collaboration with other donors to assist the authorities in this regard given the lack
of consistent Household budget and labor force surveys and reliable national accounts. In
addition, the Bank will undertake a strategic AAA program to ensure good tracking of results,
including: (i) macroeconomic monitoring; (ii) programmatic poverty assessment (FY06-FY09);
(iii) programmatic PER (FY07 -09); (iv) An Access to Credit Review (FY07) and an Investment
Climate Assessment (FY08).

Macroeconomic stability (fiscal and external sustainability) and sustained economic growth.
Good progress in the implementation of the IPS.
Improved governance structures and efficient and transparent public expenditure management.
Good progress towards European integration through facilitation of the SAp/SAA.
A conducive business environment for private investment.
Efficient, reliable and affordable infrastructure and utilities.
Establishment of efficient land markets and secure land and property rights.
Sustained agriculture growth, rural development and job creation in rural areas.
Improved service delivery at national and local levels and sustained support to the decentralization process.
Improved quality and equity of education services and raising education attainment and enrollment rates.
Improved quality and accessibility of health services.
Improve provision of fiscally-sustainable social security and assistance services.
Raising the share of population with access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation.

VII. RISKS AND MITIGATION REMEDIES
79.
Regional Stability. While Albania is striving to foster its integration in the SEE region
and in the EU, the external environment poses some risks for sustained economic development.
Political instability and uncertainty in the region affects the investment climate in Albania and
adverse developments in the region could spill over to Albania, as was the case with the Kosovo
crisis in 1999. The political consensus in the country on fostering peaceful cooperation and noninterference in political developments of neighboring countries demonstrated by Albania in the
last decade and a half indicates that such risks are manageable. Strong political commitment
across the region to EU integration will further serve to mitigate political risks. The Bank will
monitor regional developments closely and make necessary adjustments to the support strategy if
warranted.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

35

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

80.
Exogenous Shocks. Economic prospects in Europe and hydrological variations pose the
two most important exogenous risks. Economic prospects in Europe (and Italy and Greece in
particular) will impact directly on Albania’s economic prospects due to its high reliance on
remittances. Government efforts to diversify its sources of foreign exchanges both in terms of
diversification and promotion of its merchandise exports and labor markets, as well as the Bank
support program, will mitigate this risk. The high vulnerability of the country to variations in
hydrology due to Albania’s existing over-dependence on hydropower poses a significant risk to
economic activity and macroeconomic stability. As a result of concerted action by the
Government and KESH, aided by favorable hydrology over the last two years, Albania is slowly
emerging from a major electricity crisis, caused by shortage of electricity supply, which
adversely affected both its macroeconomic performance and the quality of life of its inhabitants.
During a dry cycle, Albania will again have to rely heavily on imports, and regional shortages
may emerge causing a rise in the prices of electricity imports. This risk will be mitigated by
consistent implementation of the energy strategy (reduction in technical losses, etc.) and the
diversification of domestic generation capacities (e.g., thermal power plants).
81.
Political Risks. There are also potential risks to the implementation of the reform
program stemming from domestic political developments. First, political polarization between
the two largest parties represents a potential source of instability and may result in delays in
reaching national consensus around critical reforms necessary for EU integration. Second, the
new Government is composed of coalition with a number of smaller parties which may results in
delays in reaching agreements and thus limiting the government’s ability to pursue necessary farreaching governance reforms. Flexibility in the CAS program will enable the Bank to adjust its
support strategy should the political conditions warrant.

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS
82.
Albania is well poised to continue its strong economic performance and make significant
strides towards its goal of full European integration in the next four years. However, the
government must make inroads against the governance problems that remain pervasive, and also
attract investment and develop its human capital. A key challenge will also be to ensure that the
benefits of continued economic prosperity accrue equitably across Albanian society, with
particular attention to the poorest. The Bank will continue to be a strong partner with Albania as
it faces these challenges in the coming four years and is committed to helping the government to
achieve the results described in this CAS. A mid-term review of the CAS (CASPR in FY08)
would take stock of progress towards achieving the CAS outcomes and results and propose
appropriate adjustments to the support strategy for FY08-FY09.

ANNEX 2: ALBANIA’S CAS COMPLETION REPORT, FY02-FY05
Date of the CAS: 28 May 2002
Date of the Completion Report: June 2005

A.

Period Covered by the CAS: June 2003-June 2005
Prepared by: Nadir Mohammed, Country Manager and
Tim Gilbo, Country Officer

INTRODUCTION

1.
This CAS Completion Report evaluates the impact and effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance,
and the outcomes achieved, through the implementation of the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Albania during FY02-FY05 (hereafter referred to as CAS02). While CAS02 was not prepared
using a Results-Based methodology, this report attempts to retrofit a results-based framework to it as a
basis for a new CAS covering FY06-09 (hereafter CAS06). The retrofitted CAS02 Results Matrix has
been prepared as if it had been done when the CAS was originally prepared in FY02.
2.
A number of diagnostic studies, assessments and reports have informed the preparation of this
report: (i) Quality Assurance Group (QAG) “Albania: Country Lending Assessment” (April 2004); (ii)
QAG review of the AAA program (2004); (iii) two Joint Staff Assessments of the National Strategy for
Socio-Economic Development [NSSED – Albania’s PRSP (2003 and 2004)]; (vi) Country Economic
Memorandum (2004); (v) the Clients Assessment Survey in December 2004; and (vi) OED’s Country
Assistance Evaluation (2005).12 Annex A compares actual and planned CAS lending. Annex B reviews
the implementation of the non-lending support envisaged by the CAS02. Annex C presents a retrofitted
Results Matrix for CAS02, which has been used to assess progress in achieving outcomes over the period
FY02-FY05.
3.
The CAS02 Completion Report concludes that the Bank’s assistance to the implementation of
Albania’s NSSED program through FY02-FY05 was Satisfactory.3 The NSSED process did create an
improved framework for poverty reduction and policy reform by strengthening country ownership of the
reform program, reinforcing a long-term vision, engaging in partnerships, and focusing on results.
Positive outcomes have been recorded towards poverty reduction, institution building, improving public
administration, upgrading infrastructure, supporting agriculture, advancing financial sector reforms, and
preserving macro-economic stability. Outcomes were relatively less positive in strengthening the
governance environment, advancing the efficient delivery of social services and environmental
sustainability. While most programs and projects contributed to satisfactory outcomes, impacts on
sustainability and institutional development are rated by this report as relatively modest.
4.
Overall, the Bank’s performance in the delivery of the assistance to Albania through CAS02 is
also rated as Satisfactory. The Bank’s CAS02 support was relevant to the country’s priorities and built on
successful interventions that had either been completed or were ongoing at end FY02. In addition to
financing numerous priority programs and projects, strong policy dialogue and analytical work helped to

The ratings and assessments of the Bank’s assistance to Albania in this CASCR are overall in conformity with
those of the OED’s CAE as well as the lessons drawn from previous programs. There are, however, differences in
some ratings due to two considerations: (i) the CAE covers FY98-FY04, while this CASCR covers FY02-FY05
(including 4 project approved in FY05); and (ii) the CASCR makes use of recent data on governance that became
available in May 2005 (e.g., WBI governance indicators).

improve the focus on poverty reduction, building of institutions and maintaining macroeconomic stability.
Successful experience with community-driven development (CDD) approaches from previous
interventions was replicated and extended to new sectors and operations.
Box 1: OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation
A 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by OED assessed IDA’s assistance to Albania during FY98-FY04.
The CAE concluded that the overall development impact of IDA’s assistance is rated “moderately satisfactory”.
OED ratings of projects completed during the period indicate that Albania ranks higher than the Bank and ECA
region in terms of satisfactory outcomes but lower in terms of institutional development impact and
sustainability. The CAE indicates that the Bank’s assistance was effective when the government adopted, and
donors supported a sector strategy that laid out a reform agenda (e.g., energy sector). It also underscored the
importance of developing the analytical underpinning and strategy, the long-term objectives of institutional
development and project sustainability and sustained efforts for donor coordination.
The CAE suggests that the new CAS06 should move the strategy and projects towards an outcome oriented
approach and be more selective. It also suggests filling knowledge gaps in health, infrastructure and urban
development and the importance of working with the present administrative structure of government and
gradually phase out the project implementation units.

B.

CONTEXT OF THE CAS02

I.

Albania’s Medium-Term Strategies and Long-Term Vision

5.

The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), completed by the Government of Albania
(GoA) in 2001, expressed Albania’s long-term vision of European integration and was intended to
complement the Stabilization and Association process (SAp). The GPRS, which was subsequently
renamed the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED), demonstrates the
country’s serious effort to use a comprehensive national medium-term development strategy to move
from managing short-term crises to creating the conditions that promote long-term growth and poverty
reduction. The NSSED has strong government ownership and was prepared through a participatory
process of unprecedented scope. It also contains improved poverty diagnostics and an ambitious plan for
monitoring and evaluation.
II.

Economic Developments, Growth and Poverty Trends Until 2002

6.

Albania’s record of economic and social development in the first 12 years of economic transition
was impressive. From 1990 to 2002, Albania realized the highest rates of economic growth among all
transition economies, averaging 6 percent per annum. As a result real GDP per capita reached US$ 1,380
in 2002, up from US$ 640 in 1990. Initially, real GDP contracted sharply by a cumulative 39 percent
between 1990 and 1992, however recovery began in earnest in 1993 with the successful institution of a
macroeconomic stabilization program, price and trade liberalization, and privatization of agricultural land.
Between 1993 and 1996, the economy grew at a rapid annual rate of 9.3 percent. In 1997, the collapse of
the pyramid schemes resulted in a sharp contraction in real output. Albania was, nonetheless, able to
recover swiftly from this crisis, and between 1998 and 2001, the economy grew at an average annual rate
of 7.4 percent. In 2002, an energy crisis and poor weather lowered GDP growth to 4.7 percent.

7.
Despite the rapid rates of economic growth, poverty in Albania remains widespread. A World
Bank’s Poverty Assessment completed in 2002 based on real Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) data estimated that one-quarter of the population, or close to 780,000 individuals, was below the
poverty line in that year. Extreme poverty affected about 150,000 persons, or about 5 percent of the
population, who were unable to meet even the basic food requirements. A large number of individuals

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

50

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

were clustered around the poverty lines, suggesting that even modest shocks could lead to a substantial
increase in poverty. However, inequality has been moderate with a consumption-based Gini index of 0.28.
BOX 2: THE VIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE BANK’S EFFECTIVENESS
The World Bank Office in Tirana undertook a Clients Assessment Survey in December 2004 to inform the design of
the new CAS. Survey Questionnaires were distributed to 350 stakeholders. Some 137 respondents (39% response rate)
from the Presidency, Cabinet as well as Parliamentarians (7.7% of respondents); civil servants and public sector
employees including implementation units (31.2%); local governments (14.9%); bilateral and multilateral donors
agencies (10.0%); private sector (9.0%); civil society organizations (11.0%); media (9.0%); academic and research
institutions (3.7%) and other stakeholders (2.5%) responded to the survey. The results were compared with a similar
survey that was undertaken in 2001 for the CAS02 formulation.
Overall, clients’ perceptions about the importance of the issues addressed by the Bank and its effectiveness in
addressing them are high and showing marked increases since 2001. In particular, the Bank’s effectiveness in poverty
reduction, public sector reforms, adoption of sound macroeconomic and trade policies and assistance in EU
integration were the most important aspects of the Bank work in Albania and the Bank has been very effective in
addressing them. The Bank’s effectiveness in promoting economic growth, improving governance and private sector
environment, promotion of investment and social inclusion were also considered important aspects of the Bank’s
support but the Bank’s effectiveness in addressing them has not been as high as the first category of support areas.
Finally, Bank’s support to Albania has been rated as very effective in concentrating on Albania’s realties and
priorities. The Bank has been characterized as being flexible to adjust to changing country conditions and for giving
realism to Albania’s situation and constraints.

RETROFITTING THE RESULTS FRAMEWORK

8.
CAS02, which was presented to the Board in May 2002, supported the three NSSED pillars of
improving governance, promoting private sector development and fostering human resource development,
with institution building as a crosscutting theme to be imbedded in all interventions. CAS02 also

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

51

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

emphasized the importance of selectivity within sectors, and made comprehensive assessments of
challenges, opportunities and constraints in each sector. CAS02 made a convincing case for the selection
of specific Bank operations and activities, which aimed to address root development problems, especially
weak governance and institutions, tenuous rule of law and enormous infrastructure deficiencies,
especially in the power sector. CAS02 also aimed to support the prospects of closer ties to European
structures in the context of impending negotiations of a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA)
with the EU.4

9.

Objectives of CAS02, and the retrofitted Results Matrix. CAS02 outlined a three pronged
strategy based on: (i) Improving the governance and strengthening the institutions; (ii) Promoting
sustainable private sector activity; and (iii) Fostering human development. While CAS02 did not outline
the expected outcomes from the Bank’s past and proposed interventions,5 it did seek to systematically
track specific indicators that could be used to assess progress towards key objectives. In the interests of
establishing a robust results framework as a basis for the next CAS, a Retrofitted Results Matrix has been
developed for CAS02, based on the original articulated CAS indicators as well as conditionality and
monitoring indicators that were subsequently developed in the context of individual CAS02 operations
(Annex C). The text below describes progress in achieving these retrofitted outcomes, with Columns III
and IV of the retrofitted results matrix reproduced in the text to facilitate discussion.
Objective I: Improving Governance and Strengthening Institutions

10.
CAS02 recognized that Albania’s public institutions had been unable to keep pace with the
country’s economic transformation. It considered weak governance and institutions and tenuous rule of
law as a core constraint to development. Thus, improved governance was highlighted as one of three
inter-related objectives of CAS02, as was the case for the NSSED, while institution building was a
crosscutting theme. In addressing this objective, CAS02 specifically sought to: (a) strengthen public
administration and civil service; (b) strengthen the judiciary and reduce corruption; and (c) strengthen
local government and build social consensus. Numerous programs and projects in the portfolio in 2002, as
well as interventions in CAS02, supported government efforts to achieve this objective: Public
Administration Reform Project, Tirana Transparency Project, the PRSC program, as well as the Legal and
Judicial Reform Project (Annex C).
11.
Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to the overall governance/institution building
agenda are assessed as partially achieved. Overall outcomes have varied substantially across various
aspects of the governance and institution building agenda.
12.
Outcome 1: Reforming the Public Administration and reducing corruption in Government.
Civil service and public administration reform outcomes have been particularly satisfactory, with
successful establishment of a legal framework for the civil service and substantial progress made in the
implementation of the Civil Service Law (CSL). The Civil Service Commission has become an
increasingly effective mechanism for protecting the due process requirements of the CSL. A professional
and increasingly merit-based civil service has become a new domestic constituency promoting effective
implementation of the law, as they derive benefits and increased job security from it. However, anticorruption efforts have, with some exceptions, yielded fewer results. Good governance initiatives such as
strengthening policy monitoring and evaluation and increasing transparency and accountability in the
management of public resources, supported by the PRSC program, are still in their inception phase. The

enactment of internal audit and procurement laws allowed for establishing a basic financial accountability
system, and the state budget became increasingly comprehensive and transparent, with marked
improvements in its preparation, implementation and monitoring. The opportunities for corruption in
public administration have been reduced with the enactment and implementation of the law on ethics and
public administration, and by a reduction in the size of government through privatization. The Tirana
Transparency Project (FY01-FY04) provided further support to efforts to increase transparency in public
administration. These interventions and non-lending activities (e.g. anti-corruption technical assistance)
contributed to advancing and updating the Government’s anti-corruption strategy. Recent government
surveys point to a mixed picture of governance and corruption indicators (either deterioration or modest
improvements)6 (Table 1.1).

Political interference in the hiring and firing of civil
servants has been reduced. At the end of FY05, all positions
are being advertised (and regularly tracked). Competitive
filling of positions has increased from 52% in 2001 to 80%
in 2004. Contractual services to the Government – which
have been used as a mechanism to bypass new CS laws were reduced from 16% of total CS recruitment in 2001 to
0.9% in 2004. Performance evaluations covered 76% of
employees in 2003. The application of the CSL was
extended to cover tax and custom administration by 2004.
Improvements in the wage system – as assessed by a further
five criteria (salary grade compression, competitiveness
etc.) have also been made. A code of ethics and mandatory
income/asset declarations has been legislated and are being
enforced. The Law on Organization and Functioning of the
Council of Ministers (Law No. 9000) and the Law on
Ethics in Public Administration (Law No. 9131) were
enacted in January and September 2003, respectively. Basic
financial accountability system is in place with the adoption
of laws on internal audit and procurement. Evaluation
criteria for public procurement and outcomes have been
established, with publication of the final results. Internal
audit units have been established and the computerization
of the Treasury in Tirana has been largely completed.

13.
Outcome 2: Strengthening management of public expenditure. Good progress has been made
with the implementation of the NSSED and the integration of the planning and budgeting systems.7
Implementation of the NSSED gained momentum after a slow start in 2002 due to political instability
6

The most recent WBI governance indicators (May 2005) show overall improvements in governance indicators in
Albania in 2004 in comparison with 2002 (5 out of 6 governance indicators have improved though still problematic
in comparison with other countries). The second Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) pointed to concerns about weak governance structures and poor business environment in Albania during
1999-2002. It indicated perceptions of increased corruption and state capture in comparison with the first BEEPS
that covered the period 1996-1999.
7
Largely due to these reforms, the International Country Risk Group (ICRG) index for bureaucratic quality show an
increase from 1 to 2 between 1997 and 2004 (see World Bank, OED Report 2005).

resulting from three government changes. In 2003 implementation improved and the GoA prepared its
first annual progress report. This coincided with the availability of data from the first representative
Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), which further strengthened poverty diagnostics. While
efforts to more closely link the NSSED and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) have been
consistent, real progress has been slow, as noted by Bank and IMF Joint Staff Assessments of the NSSED
Annual Progress Reports. Progress was more evident towards establishing capacities for monitoring and
evaluation in line ministries and the creation of the Department for the NSSED within the Ministry of
Finance. Additionally, there has been some progress in linking the implementation of the strategy with the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SAp as well as other policy frameworks,8 and in
strengthening coordination through active engagement with the donor community. The Public
Administration Reform Project from the pre-CAS02 portfolio (FY00) and the PRSC program in CAS02
addressed priority issues in public expenditure management, human resource management, and policy
formulation (Table 1.2).

While the MTEF is now the primary budgetary tool, it is
not satisfactorily linked with longer-term objectives
outlined in the NSSED or driven by policy. The conformity
between annual budgets and the MTEF has been
improving, but needs to be strengthened further. A new tax
reform law was made effective in 2003. The capacity of the
MoF to provide input into the fiscal impact of policies has
been increased, however such advice is not routinely
provided during the policy planning stages. A National
Training Strategy for Local Government was approved and
a Training Agency established. Progress has been made
with fiscal decentralization, supported by Bank ESW and
the PRSC program. The Land Tax was reinstated as a local
tax; the former Small Business Tax was split into the Local
Small Business Tax and the Simplified Profit Tax, and both
became local own taxes; the law on local taxes and fees
was reviewed and other taxes transformed in "own tax” act.
The 2002 provisional formula for the distribution of State
unconditional transfers to the local self-governments was
revised in 2003. Progress was also made in finalizing the
education and health sector strategies and accompanying
implementation action plans that delineate service
provision responsibilities between the local and central
governments. Progress in delineation of functions between
central and local governments has been slow and remains
contingent upon a new law on financing of local
governments which is in preparatory stage. The Bank is
currently supporting this work through an IDF grant.

14.
Although the legal framework for decentralization is in place, there was limited progress towards
effective decentralization during the CAS02. Local self-government was founded on the principle of
decentralization defined in the new Constitution of 1998, and a corresponding Strategy of
Decentralization and Local Autonomy was completed in 1999. To support implementation of the
decentralization strategy a National Committee for Decentralization, advised by a technical secretariat
called the Group of Experts on Decentralization (GED), was also established. Despite these initial
regulatory and institutional achievements, further implementation of the Government’s decentralization
strategy has not proceeded rapidly due to: (i) the fragmented structure of local administrative units; (ii)
weak administrative capacity (both at local and central levels); (iii) remaining uncertainties in the
assignment of responsibilities and competences to the local authorities; (iv) the absence of clear standards
of services and measurement criteria of performance in service delivery; and (v) an inadequate degree of
revenue autonomy and predictability. While the Bank was able to provide timely advice through ESW,9
significant outcomes were not achieved in the CAS02 period due to a lack of synergy and fragmentation
in the support provided by various projects.10

Outcome 3: Increasing the effectiveness of the judicial system. The Legal and Judicial Reform
Project (LJRP - FY00) also contributed by strengthening legal education, strengthening courts,
establishing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and improving the legal information infrastructure.
However, compared to public administration reforms, support to the legal and judicial system has yielded
fewer concrete results. While good progress has been made towards building institutional foundations in
some areas, the cumulative effects of numerous initiatives by the Bank and other donors have not
translated into marked improvements in the rule of law, law enforcement and measurable reductions in
corruption and incidence of state capture according to anecdotal evidence and recent surveys. For
example, while on paper Albania now has one of the best procurement frameworks in the Balkans, large
infrastructure contracts in some sectors are still finalized without transparent and competitive bidding
(Table 1.3 above).
Objective II: Promoting Sustainable Private Sector Growth

16.

Under this pillar, CAS02 emphasized the importance of: (a) maintaining macroeconomic
stability; (b) improving the environment for private investment; (c) reforming the financial sector; (d)
completing enterprise privatization; (e) sustaining agricultural growth; and (f) fostering broad-based rural
growth. CAS02 also noted the need to improve infrastructure and create institutional environments
conducive to infrastructure sustainability, especially through community or private sector participation,
and to promote environmental sustainability and the sustainable use of natural resources. Outcomes under
this objective were supported through various lending and non-lending activities in both the pre-CAS02
portfolio as well as new activities in CAS02, including: Private Industry Recovery Project, Financial
Sector Institution Building TA Project, the PRSC program, Recovery Program TA Project, FSAC,
Microcredit Project, Forestry Project, Irrigation and Drainage II, Pilot Fishery Development Project,
Water Resources Management, Municipal Water and Wastewater Project, Agricultural Services Project,
Power Transmission and Distribution Project, Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project,
Power Sector Generation and Restructuring Project, Energy Community of South East Europe APL
Project, Road Maintenance Supplemental and Urban Land Development Project (Annex C).

17.
Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to the overall promotion of sustainable private
sector growth during CAS02 have been achieved. Outcomes have varied substantially across different
areas of the private sector agenda. Outcomes have been highly satisfactory in infrastructure (especially in
the energy sector), financial sector reforms, agricultural development and rural development. However, in
the areas of environment and natural resource development positive outcomes have been generally slow
to materialize.
18.

As noted earlier, macroeconomic performance, and the private sector contribution to it, has
remained strong during CAS02. The period was characterized by sound monetary and financial sector
policies, fiscal consolidation, successful privatization, and a substantial improvement in the performance
of the electricity sector that has significantly reduced the macroeconomic risks posed by Albania’s
reliance on hydroelectric power generation. Private sector contribution to GDP and growth continued to
increase in the last three years. Private investment picked up from about 17 percent of GDP in 2002 to
more than 20 percent of GDP by 2004 while public investment declined by 2 percentage points during the
same period.

19.

Outcome 1: Improving the facilitating environment for investment, production and export
by the private sector. Although significant progress has been made in reducing the administrative
barriers to investors’ entry, a survey conducted in 2004 shows that there are still some impediments to be
overcome (e.g. unfair practices, tax rates, electricity supply, corruption and frequent changes to the
regulatory framework). With the support from the World Bank’s FSAC project, a new accounting law has

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

56

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

been enacted and accounting standards are improving. Some progress, albeit partial, was observed in
improving the legal framework and alternatives for resolving commercial disputes (Table 2.1).

RESULTS
A Study on the Administrative Barriers was completed in
2003 with support from FIAS, and an Action Plan to
address them is under implementation. About 80% of the
actions envisaged under the Action Plan have been
implemented or under implementation. According to a
survey in 2004, the severity of most of the administrative
barriers was reduced compared to 2002, in particular those
related to the customs administration. However, the survey
shows that the general perception of the business
community is that the major impediments to business
growth still continue to be: (i) unfair practices, (ii) tax
rates, (iii) electricity supply, (iv) corruption, and (v)
frequent changes of regulatory framework. A new
accounting law was enacted in April 2004 and an
institutional development plan for bankruptcy enforcement
and secured financing has been implemented. The
business plan for the Bank Asset Resolution Trust
portfolio has been completed with support from the
Bank’s FSAC project, and implementation is under way.
An Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) institution for
commercial disputes has been formed and its staff trained,
and is ready to accept cases. No disputes have been
referred to the ADR to date however, and thus this
outcome has not been fully achieved.

Outcome 2: Strengthening the financial sector and supporting robust private sector growth.
CAS02 successfully supported the final phase of the transition of the role of the state in the financial
sector from that of owner to one of regulator. The Bank supported this transition by helping to improve
the legal and institutional framework necessary for functioning of a market-based financial sector and
strengthening of the independence and capacity of the Central Bank. Driven by strong government
commitment, and facilitated by the considerable credibility that the Bank has built with relevant
stakeholders, the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and the Financial Sector Institution
Building Technical Assistance (FSIBTA) successfully supported the State’s divestiture of its bank
holdings, and the establishment of a legal, institutional and supervisory framework for sound financial
sector development (including non-banking sector such as insurance). The Savings Bank was privatized
and the moratorium on its lending activities has been lifted and the state insurance company (INSIG) was
partially privatized. The Bank of Albania (BoA) has substantially strengthened its supervisory capacity
through the implementation of a more risk-based supervision process. The legal, regulatory and
supervisory framework for non-financial institutions has been modernized, and the bankruptcy, collateral,
debt resolution frameworks have been strengthened. These achievements have been particularly
noteworthy in consideration of the financial sector crisis that engulfed Albania in 1997 (Table 2.2).

Outcome 3: Improving rural productivity and higher incomes in rural areas. Management
responsibility for almost all irrigation networks has been transferred to farmers associations, which are
also gradually becoming involved in flood protection. The concept of community-managed resources has
been expanded in fisheries and forests, with Fishery Management Organizations (FMOs) established to
manage fishery resources and ports and forest management transferred to over 100 communes. Access to
finance in rural areas has also improved through increased coverage of the credit associations and
increased bank lending. Microcredit schemes have been extended to both urban and rural areas, and the
institutions providing them have matured in terms of both financial and operational sustainability.
Agricultural productivity in rural areas has increased, with the annual income for a typical farmer
benefiting from the Bank supported irrigation rehabilitation increased by about US$ 600.11 (Table 2.3).
11

The first irrigation and drainage project helped rehabilitation of 58,000 hectare of irrigation and 130,000 hectare
of drainage and promoted the formation of about 200 water users associations (WUAs).

Outcome 4: Improving environmental conditions and more sustainable use of natural
resources. With the transfer of forest management to communes, the illegal logging of forests has been
reduced. The establishment of the Environmental Inspectorate allowed for improvements in the
enforcement of environmental regulations, while there are on-going efforts to reduce urban sewerage
pollution with works currently undertaken in several cities in Albania. However, the general progress in
this area has been slow, and two Bank projects supporting further results in this area were not approved
until the last quarter of CAS02 (Table 2.4).

23.
Outcome 5: Reducing macroeconomic risks associated with the energy sector and
improving reliability of power supply. Energy sector performance improved significantly over the
CAS02 period, through the sustained implementation of a multi-year Power Sector Action Plan developed
under the Bank’s leadership. Quantitative performance targets outlined in the Action Plan were met in 15
out of the 16 quarters since its adoption in 2001. Illegal electricity usage has been progressively reduced,
collections have increased, and tariffs are being gradually raised, while at the same time a scheme to
protect socially vulnerable consumers from the impacts of price rises has been introduced. These
achievements, coupled with favorable hydrology in 2003 and 2004, have resulted in diminished
macroeconomic risks from the energy sector, improved electricity supply as well as a significantly
improved financial performance by KESH (the Albanian electricity utility). Although significant
electricity imports may still be necessary in the future, no subsidy from the Government budget will be
required from 2005 onwards. Substantial governance-related improvements were also achieved, including
improvements in the management structure of KESH, stronger internal financial controls leading to

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

increased transparency in the financial transactions undertaken by KESH, the establishment of an
independent electricity regulator, the effective implementation of new laws to facilitate payment
discipline by household and private consumers, and enforced payment discipline among budgetary and
non-budgetary entities (Table 2.5).

RESULTS
Load shedding has been reduced. Collection and

Action Plan were met in 15 of the 16 quarters
since the start of 2001. Losses during 2004 were
36.6%, and collections increased to 94.7%
during the year (from Lek 8.1 billion in 2000 to
Lek 27 billion in 2004). As a result, import
subsidies to KESH progressively declined from
US$ 22 million in 2002 to US$ 2.5 million in
2004. No subsidy is envisaged for 2005 and
beyond particularly after the establishment of an
Equalization Fund. All existing household
consumers have been provided with meters. A
Transmission System Operator is established,
and a Transitional Market Model developed. A
subsidy is being provided to socially vulnerable
consumers to mitigate the impact of electricity
price increases. Laws to enforce payment
discipline were strengthened and enforcement
was strengthened.

24.

Outcome 6: More efficient operation and management of transport and water
infrastructure. Tremendous bottlenecks in water and roads have been recognized as representing major
constraints to the further development of private sector, sustained economic growth and poverty
alleviation. CAS02 introduced various lending and non-lending activities resulting in significant progress
in the transport sector. Numerous road investments were completed, focused on the main East–West12 and
the North-South Corridor. Maintenance works were also completed to remediate damage caused by heavy
trucks during Kosovo crisis, and institutional changes to increase the efficiency and targeting of road
maintenance were effected. The functioning of the vital Durres port was improved through rehabilitation
of infrastructure, establishment of an autonomous port authority, privatization of some port operations
and overall improvements in custom procedures. In the railway sub-sector, the Albanian Railways
Company (HSH) was transformed into a joint stock company, but a badly needed restructuring and
rationalization of HSH in line with EU guidelines is yet to be undertaken, and the railway sub-sector
continues to be financially unsustainable while providing extremely limited services. Other improvements
have been made including lowering the non-tariff costs of trade and transport, reform of customs
procedures, and improvements in border crossing facilities.13 However, institutional development in the

13

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

transport sector has been notably less successful. Although nascent reforms of the General Road
Directorate have been initiated, much remains to be done to implement approved legislation, prioritize
investments and build the capacity of institutions in the sector. The completion of the Albanian National
Transport Plan (ANTP), with the support of the EU, provides a much-needed overall strategy on which a
long overdue program of prioritized investments in transport can be developed. However, despite the
Bank’s long-term involvement in the sector, the Government proceeded in FY05 with large projects and
concessions of dubious economic and social benefit that are not transparently planned and procured, and
are not in line with the ANTP and NSSED priorities (Table 2.6).

RESULTS
A pavement management system was introduced in

Administration will be completed by the end of
2005. Bank road projects supported the
construction/rehabilitation of 1,700 km of rural
roads, and 1,300 km of national roads. The function
of the vital Durres port was improved through
rehabilitation of infrastructure, establishment of an
autonomous port authority, privatization of some
port operations and overall improvements in
custom procedures, safety and port operations. The
TTFSE project also assisted in improving
infrastructure improvements at two border
crossings as well as connectivity between border
positions and the Center. Improvements in water
services were achieved (average use, connections,
safety compliance, increased collections of water
bills) with the engagement of private operators in 4
cities by management contracts.

25.
In the water supply and sanitation sector, there has been progress in improving infrastructure,
governance, private sector participation as well as in strengthening of institutions. The Bank’s policy
advice and lending assisted the preparation of a comprehensive National Water Supply and Sanitation
Strategy and a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy. However, the government has made little
progress in implementing the rural water supply strategy, and in rural areas water supply and sanitation
services have further deteriorated during CAS02. In urban areas, urgent rehabilitation measures have been
implemented, which were successful in bridging a gap in maintenance and rehabilitation services until a
management contract was implemented in four cities. Municipalities were empowered to control water
supply and wastewater services and investments, and institutional arrangements have been established for
the municipalities to have arms-length relationships with private service providers. Consumer panels have
been initiated as a mechanism for strengthening governance of service delivery (Table 2.6).
26.

Outcome 7: Improving access of the poor to urban infrastructure. The NSSED also aimed to
provide essential urban infrastructure in participating municipalities, supported by the Bank’s Urban Land
Management project (FY98). This has led to the adoption of more efficient methods of providing
community infrastructure (where beneficiaries decide on the priorities and contribute to its financing),
supported by land tenure reforms. However, poor urban land planning and enforcement remains a serious
obstacle for cost effective investment decisions, and hampers service improvements. Also, delays in
enacting the laws on land restitution and legalization of informal settlement have reduced the potential
impact of the interventions of the Bank and other stakeholders (Table 2.7).

Objective III: Fostering Human Development

27.
Social sector indicators place Albania at the bottom of European countries in the area of social
development. The country faces a formidable agenda, with high levels of unemployment and high poverty
prevalence). Net education enrollment rates, the quality and quantity of health infrastructure and access to
health services have actually declined in the post-transition era. CAS02 represented a shift in the Bank’s
approach from emergency-type interventions towards a focus on infrastructure and institution building at
the central level. Outcomes towards this objective were also largely supported by interventions initiated
prior to 2002, namely: Education Reform Project, Social Services Development Project and Health
Recovery Project, as well as a strong policy reform element addressed through the CAS02 PRSC program
(Annex C).
28.
Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to fostering human resource development during
implementation of CAS02 are assessed to have been achieved. Again, outcomes have varied substantially
across various aspects of the social sector reforms.
29.
Outcome 1: Improving the educational outcomes. Despite the minor progress, the overall
condition of the Albanian education sector remains quite poor at the end of the CAS02 period. However,
the completion of sector strategies and policy papers on decentralization were critical milestones in the
reforms of the sector, and concrete steps towards institutional reforms, preparation of actions plan for the
implementation of the strategy and strengthening of assessment and examination capacities were initiated
in this period. Albania has also completed its submission for the Education For All (EFA) initiative,
which outlines specific targets to be met. However, other efforts aimed at increasing the enrollment and
attainment level in primary and secondary education, introducing curriculum reforms in order to improve
education quality and improving the monitoring of performance of the education sector, are in their
nascent stage and yet to yield substantial results (Table 3.1).

Outcome 2: Improving the accessibility and quality of preventive/curative health services.
The situation in the health sector has improved modestly, although from very poor initial conditions, and
against a backdrop of a significant budget constraint. The quality of basic preventive and curative health
services has improved, and the number of trained doctors and nurses has increased. A national HIV/AIDS
strategy has also been adopted and there is an on-going effort to implement the health sector strategy and
policy paper on decentralization of health services (Table 3.2).

Outcome 3: Improving the sustainability and targeting of the social safety net. Despite
implementation delays, improved overall delivery of social services through demand-driven communitybased services is being successfully piloted, while a policy paper on decentralization of social services
was adopted in late 2004. A series of parametric reforms to the pension system supported by the PRSC
program have contributed to improving the sustainability of the urban pension system. However, the
pensions system (particularly the rural system) is not yet actuarially sound and its financial integrity is not
yet ensured (Table 3.3).

Overall Bank Performance

32.
Overall, the Bank’s performance is rated as Satisfactory. Bank assistance to Albania was well
aligned with key priorities identified in the country’s NSSED. Through lending and non-lending
interventions, the Bank advanced reforms in numerous sectors and did achieve tangible results and
outcomes. It has also played a key role in donor coordination, as well as attracting co-financing in most of
its projects and programs. The Government considers the Bank as a valued and trusted partner,
particularly in policy formulation. The Bank has also built considerable credibility with stakeholders,
including external partners, the Parliament, the business community, representatives of the local
government and NGOs, as documented by successive client surveys.
33.
The CAS02 employed an appropriate and effective mix of Bank instruments (development policy
and investment lending as well as ESW/AAA) and achieved significant synergies between projects. For
example, the PRSCs supported far-reaching institutional reforms in the social sector as well as the
development of policies for delivery of social services while investment operations supported the
upgrading of infrastructure and facilities within those sectors. Similarly linkages were also critical to
successful outcomes in civil service reform and building of capacity in public financial management and
accountability. However, while implementation of the CAS saw remarkable progress in fostering CDD
projects (community works, fisheries, irrigation and drainage, etc.) that are now recognized as best
practices in the ECA region and elsewhere, the small size and dispersion of such initiatives resulted in
them having limited institutional impact. In these parts of the portfolio there was not substantial linkage
between the ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ activities supported by the Bank.
34.
There are other areas in which the Bank could have done more work, including promoting the
private sector development agenda, and environmental sustainability. The lending/AAA program also did

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

66

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

not adequately address emerging issues such as those resulting from the rapid migration from rural areas.
More coherence could also have been achieved in efforts to improve governance, by ensuring that sectoral
governance consideration were mainstreamed into all lending/AAA products, and linked to top level
reforms being supported by the PRSC program.
The quality of the Bank’s project preparation, supervision and ESW was satisfactory.14 While the
proportion of the Bank’s resources devoted to knowledge products was lower than the regional average,
this allowed for enhanced supervision effort, which was appropriate in the Albanian context. At the outset
of the new CAS lending program there are no problem or risky projects in the portfolio, due largely to the
level of supervision effort.

35.

36.
Bank Performance – Objective I. Overall, the Bank’s performance in strengthening governance
and building institutions through CAS02 is judged as Satisfactory. In addition to strategic ESW,15 this
pillar was directly supported by (i) the Public Administration Reform Project (PARP); (ii) the Legal and
Judicial Reform (LJRP); and (iii) the Poverty Reduction Support Credit program of three adjustment
credits (PRSCs). The mix of lending and AAA for support on governance and institutional building is
judged to be appropriate. The Bank’s projects and programs were informed by substantial core diagnostic
work (such as the CFAA, PEIR and CPAR) that had been undertaken prior to the CAS02. Throughout
implementation, the monitoring and evaluation built into the PARP provided many of the inputs required
for public administration reforms. The Bank also supported the NSSED process through AAA on poverty
analysis as well as guidance on the annual progress reports in 2003 and 2004.
37.
The Bank’s interventions in support of strengthening governance and building institutions,
particularly with regard to elimination of corruption and support to decentralization, have not led to fully
satisfactory outcomes due to numerous design and implementation factors and to unanticipated changes in
the policy environment that delayed and/or halted some reforms. Particularly relevant factors included:
•
Political commitment to the implementation of some laws lagged behind in areas such as improving
the contestability of policy formulation, fighting corruption and procurement reforms. This
contributed to perceptions of increased state capture in Albania;
•
The institutional framework for implementing the Anti-Corruption Plan (ACP) and other
governance reforms remained weak, and many public sector reforms suffered from internal capacity
constraints;
•
Some reforms in public financial management were delayed due to the delay in completing the
modernization of the treasury system until 2006;
•
The Bank’s support for decentralization has not been comprehensive, and different projects have
tackled the issue in an uncoordinated manner, despite the preparation of a comprehensive report on
the subject;
•
Selectivity in institution building across sectors, and within sectors, proved to be difficult despite
the intentions of CAS02;
•
Weak donor coordination and Government leadership delayed some reforms measures when Bank
programs were designed on expectations of prior key reforms supported by other donors.16

14

For projects exiting between FY97 and FY04, OED rated outcomes of 89% of the projects (by value) as
satisfactory; 47% had substantial institutional development impact and 77% were considered to have likely
sustainability.
15
For example, the lessons learned from the 1997-02 institutional and governance reform program (covering anticorruption measures, public administration, tax and customs and the legal and judicial system) were taken into
consideration in the design of the CAS02.
16
In other public sector reform programs, improved donor coordination facilitated the implementation of Bank'
programs and provided additional flexibility. For instance, budget reallocations in the PARP were possible because

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

•

The lack of broad sector approaches as a base for some investment lending operations has been an
obstacle to achieving changes in policies outside the scope of these projects.17

38.

Bank Performance – Objective II. Overall, the Bank’s performance in supporting sustainable
private sector growth is rated as Satisfactory. Focusing on this area of Albania’s NSSED was appropriate,
as confirmed by the Bank’s FY04 CEM that outlined the critical importance of attracting private
investments. However, while the Bank’s support included a number of successful single operations that
fully met their development objectives, the somewhat fragmented approach did not constitute a
comprehensive private sector development strategy. The interventions of the Bank and other partners had
limited success in leveraging structural reforms and produce a significant impact in private sector growth
– with the exception of the financial and energy sectors. While the CAS did support a Rural Development
Strategy (FY02), the broader private sector development agenda was not sufficiently supported by ESW,
and the Bank’s role in facilitating dialogue between the government and the private sector was limited.
Finally, while the CAS emphasized that high growth depends on increasing exports, only limited analysis
was carried out to assess the business environment and sectoral constraints to export development. This
dearth of analytic work can be at least partly explained by the need for selectivity during the formulation
of the CAS02.

39.

Support to agriculture and rural development through pre-CAS02 and CAS02 operations has been
innovative and effective.18 Various operations have helped strengthen communities as the key
constituencies to form a counterpart to the local governments and other related decision-makers (bottomup CDD approaches) and resulted in tangible outcomes and results. Towards the end of the CAS period
the Bank’s focus has shifted to long-term local government capacity building through institutionalizing
citizen participation in all phases of infrastructure investment with considerable tangible impacts. Bank
support has adopted an "incremental approach" where sub-sector strategies have been developed during
implementation of the projects through intensive policy dialogue and provision of technical assistance.
The overall impact of the Bank’s interventions on sectoral reforms and policy formulation remained
limited, however, due to their small size, dispersion, and the lack of emphasis on institutional and policy
change within the relevant line ministries. The environmental sub-sector has also fallen short of achieving
substantial institutional and policy strengthening, in part due to the decision to delay the envisaged
projects until the last year of CAS02.

40.
Bank support to the energy sector has been highly satisfactory. CAS02 recognized the precarious
power situation as a major threat to continued macroeconomic stability and sustained growth. It
emphasized the importance of policy and institutional reforms necessary for improved sector
performance, privatization and sustainability. The Bank financed and played a critical role in supervising
a comprehensive Energy Sector Study during 2002, which served as the basis for an Energy Strategy,
adopted by the GoA in 2003, as well as a basis for the power sector reforms and for power sector
investment projects.19 The Bank supported the preparation of a Power Sector Policy Statement providing
of close cooperation with DFID and SIDA, who took over parts of financial management reform. Cooperation with
UNDP and EU has also been good in the support of policy formulation processes.
17
For instance, the reforms in the irrigation sub-sector had little impact the way government did its business.
18
At the beginning of CAS02 projects under implementation included: Microcredit, Irrigation and Drainage II,
Fishery, Forestry and Community Works. New operations under CAS02 included Water Resources Management
Project, Natural Resources Management project, and Community Works II. A few important non-lending TA
activities have also been identified to develop the policy dialogue into concrete action programs and supplement the
on-going projects. These included the Rural Strategy and the Poverty Study (both in 2002) as well as the
Participatory Budgeting Pilot and the decentralization study.
19
Bank financing to the power sector included the Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring and the Power
Sector Generation and Restructuring Projects. Both projects addressed the most critical deficiencies in power
infrastructure, which contributed to the crisis in the sector and its macroeconomic fallout.

the framework for sector restructuring, strengthening of the regulatory agency, creation of a new
electricity market, and fulfillment of Albania’s commitments under the Energy Community of South East
Europe. The Bank was then actively involved in the development of the Action Plan, its annual updates,
and in close monitoring of the achievement of the quarterly targets specified in the Action Plan. The
synergistic combination of investment lending, sector dialogue and sector work was key for successful
power sector reform, and the Bank has played a leadership role in donor coordination and the sector
dialogue with the Government, and in facilitating co-financing by other donors.20

41.
Bank Performance-Objective III. The Bank’s performance in supporting the human
development agenda is rated as Satisfactory. Despite relying to some extent on an overly optimistic
timetable for improving extremely weak institutions, the Bank was able to achieve lasting outcomes and
build the basis for further enhancements to service delivery. Wavering political commitment to reforms
coupled with the political decision to decentralize responsibilities for service delivery quickly, in the
absence of a coherent strategy for decentralization, did reduce impact, as did occasional sub-optimal
donor coordination in the sector.21
42.
A 2005 Client Assessment Survey also addressed the effectiveness of the Bank support in project
preparation and implementation. Overall, Bank’s stakeholders appreciate the technical expertise of the
Bank in Project design and implementation. The results show marked improvements in perceptions of the
Bank’s effectiveness in 2004 compared to 2001. Stakeholders also rated bank non-lending services as
very important, and indicated that the Bank’s delivery of these services has been highly effective (Box 2).
E.

LESSONS LEARNED – IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEW CAS

43.
Experience since 1991 through the preparation and implementation of three CASs points to some
clear lessons for the design of future lending operations. The implementation of the CAS02 pointed to
additional lessons to inform and improve the design of the new strategy. These include:
(i)
Clear sector strategic frameworks should precede Bank financing: The Bank’s financial support
should be directed towards sectors in which there is a clear strategy and manifest commitment of
stakeholders to its implementation. The NSSED (PRSP) needs to be augmented by such sector
strategies. Where such sectoral strategies do not exist, or ownership is lacking, the support of the
Bank should be directed towards strengthening analysis, policy reform and strategy development
through economic sector work;
(ii) Increased selectivity (fewer and larger projects and programs) in the assistance program:
While the role of IDA in initiating reforms in almost all sectors was relevant in the early
transition years and during crises, more selectivity is necessary in the new strategy. The lending
portfolio of the Bank in the last CASs has been characterized by a large number of small projects,
in almost all sectors, with a relatively large number of repeat operations. With around half of the
Bank’s direct budgetary resources allocated for project supervision, ESW has been crowded out
and the analytic underpinnings of the Bank’s work weakened. The Bank should resist pressures to
become involved in more sectors;
(iii) Creation of long-lasting and effective institutions: A gradual shift from implementation of
projects through autonomous Project Implementation Units (PIUs) towards implementation
through regular administrative structures of government is warranted to ensure strengthening of
the public administration, capacity building, and the sustainability of interventions;

20

Cofinancing and parallel financing with EBRD, EIB, KfW and Italy supported the various energy projects as well
as technical assistance support from a number of other bilateral donors.
21
Some co-financiers failed to deliver support to key activities resulting in cancellation of some project components
(e.g. the Health Reform Project).

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

69

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

(iv)

Creating and crowding-in constituencies for changes: Change can be achieved and made more
endurable by creating or crowding in stakeholders (e.g., with civil service reforms). By creating
new categories of stakeholders with the real incentives to change not only their behavior but the
behavior of other influential groups such as politicians;
(v) Governance should permeate all development interventions: Governance cannot be effectively
addressed as a ‘sector’, but needs to be mainstreamed into sectoral interventions and into the
detailed design of projects. Increased efforts to collaborate across sectors and maintain an overt
focus on governance – especially on service delivery – is likely to achieve better outcomes;
(vi) Improved donor coordination require Government leadership: even with a PRSP, the
Government needs to take an active role in the process of donor coordination, and in order for this
to happen donors must be prepared to truly align their assistance to national priorities;
(vii) Adopt an outcome-oriented approach: Design new interventions with clear outcome targets and
establish monitorable and realistic indicators in line with the national priorities;
(viii) Incorporate investment lending into Sector-Wide approaches: Some sector investment lending
has had a narrow focus, which has not adequately addressed urgent needs for sector-wide change
in policies, sector efficiency, corruption and transparency. Investment lending can have an
important impact on budget formulation in line ministries if attention is paid to the usage of the
government's own funds as well as those of the Bank. This implies that the sector assistance
should depart from a ‘project’ approach towards a more sector wide and integrated approach;
(ix) Addressing fiduciary issues requires a systematic approach: Project-specific fiduciary controls
can be effective in minimizing fiduciary abuses in Bank-funded projects but they fail to address
broad fiduciary issues that undermine sustainable development. The Bank should take a more
comprehensive approach to fiduciary safeguards in addition to project specific controls;
(x) More support to areas with high poverty rates: An analysis of the portfolio reveals a
concentration in Central and Southern Albania. With the detailed poverty data now available
highlighting the Northeast of Albania as the poorest area, the new CAS should place special
emphasis on addressing the known profile of poverty.

ANNEX 3: IFC STRATEGY IN ALBANIA, FY06-FY09
1.

IFC’S ACTIVITIES TO DATE

As of September 2005, IFC has committed about US$ 125 million in Albania, allocated to the financial
sector (7%), general manufacturing (37%), infrastructure (33%), and oil and gas (23%). In the current
portfolio, IFC has committed US$ 69 million and has mobilized about US$ 6 million as syndicated loans
in 6 projects. IFC’s disbursement factor is very high-about 90% of total commitments. In terms of IFC’s
committed portfolio per capita, Albania ranks the fourth in the ECA region.

2.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PAST CAS

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Albania, approved in May 2002, outlined the
following IFC’s strategic priorities: (i) strengthening the financial sector; (ii) supporting SME
development; (iii) acting as a catalyst in key privatizations; and (iv) providing support for private sector
investments in infrastructure. Overall, IFC has achieved good results during the last CAS period,
supporting private sector development through direct investments and donors-funded technical assistance
programs. During FY02-05, IFC has committed US$ 66 million, or about 95% of current portfolio
projects. In addition, IFC has completed or is in the process of implementing 9 technical assistance
projects focusing on institutional and capacity building in the financial sectors including insurance,
leasing, access to information for SMEs, preparation of domestic companies for EU accession,
administrative barriers to FDI and housing finance. Slow privatization in infrastructure, corruption,
corporate governance issues and reputation risks, however, have limited IFC to act as a catalyst in
privatization of strategic sectors and related investment program in infrastructure, as well as in financing
projects with local sponsors.
During FY03-05 IFC has financed, in coordination with the EBRD, three projects in insurance,
manufacturing, and telecom sectors:
• In 2003, IFC acquired 20% stake of INSIG, one of Albania’s leading insurers. During the second
stage, with the assistance of the IFC and EBRD, the Government of Albania will complete the full
privatization of INSIG by divesting its remaining stake and relinquishing its controlling interest to a
reputable technical partner;
• In 2003, IFC has also committed € 42.5 million (€ 7.5 million syndicated loan through local banks),
to support further development of the second nationwide digital GSM cellular network in Albania,
which is owned and operated by Vodafone Albania. The project is expected to increase competition,
lower costs, and provide approximately 95% of the population with the ability to access Vodafone
Albania’s mobile telecommunications network by the end of 2005;
• In 2005, IFC signed a US$ 130 million project to establish a new modern production line in Fushe
Kruja Cement Factory, with aggregate annual cement capacity of 1.3 million tons. The project will
reduce Albania’s dependence on imported cement, enhance the domestic market for construction
materials and facilitate rapid reconstruction and development of Albania’s infrastructure. IFC has
committed US$ 30 million from its own account. The financing represents the largest foreign direct
investment in Albania’s manufacturing sector since the country’s transition to a market economy in
the early 1990s.
Most of IFC’s technical assistance program in Albania is delivered through its Southeast Europe
Enterprise Development (SEED) facility. During FY03-05, SEED activities in Albania included:
• Addressing some of the crippling problems of SME financing through the development of, and
advocacy for, new financing solutions. A law on financial leasing was introduced in 2005 which has

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
81

•

proved to be a valuable financial tool to supplement conventional lending to SMEs. In addition, a
large Housing Finance TA program is being developed for the region, including Albania;
Working in supply chains has led to the introduction of international food safety standards at the
company level to add to the work on the distribution chains currently operating in the country;
Strengthening the ability of business associations to successfully advocate for regulatory changes that
affect the business enabling environment. SEED helped to introduce the Business Advisory Council
as a leading voice in the public-private dialogue;
Build awareness about the importance of implementing EU standards and systems as well assisting
export-oriented SMEs to implement them;
Helping SMEs cut through judicial red tape and reduce the cost of litigation, SEED introduced
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in the region including in Albania.

In 2002, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) conducted a study of the administrative barriers
to investment. The study included detailed policy and institutional recommendations, which were
incorporated in an Action Plan on Removing Administrative Barriers to Investors approved by the
Council of Ministers in August 2003. A high-quality self-assessment report, made available by the
Government in March 2005, provided evidence of progress, but also identified remaining gaps and
challenges to improve the regulatory business environment. FIAS is currently involved with assisting the
Government to broaden regulatory and institutional capacity for reforms.

3.

IFC STRATEGY DURING FY06-FY09

Development constraints: At an average annual growth rate of more than 6% per year over the past
decade, Albania’s performance has been impressive. Yet, there are concerns about the sustainability of
high rates of economic growth in the future. The total factor productivity growth has slowed in recent
years, and thus future economic growth will depend in a major way on the contribution of the private
sector in capital accumulation. Remittances do not constitute a solid basis for long-term economic
development and export-driven growth expansion is not taking place. In addition, the government has a
limited fiscal space and donor-provided funds cannot fill the investment needs in infrastructure. So far,
FDI has been among the lowest in the region.
The domestic market is small, domestic credit to enterprises is limited and the bulk of financing is short
term up to 1-year maturity. Entrepreneurs often lack much of the expertise needed for a modern market
economy. Corruption is high and the judiciary lacks experience with commercial disputes, and there is
poor law enforcement. Now that the country has made significant progress on macroeconomic
stabilization, policy issues affecting fair competition are among the most significant impediments to
private sector development. Underdeveloped infrastructure sector is holding back the private sector
growth, including in sectors with huge potential for growth such as in tourism.
IFC’s Objectives: In this environment, there is a clear role for the IFC to play in Albania through
promoting private sector development (one of the two pillars of the current CAS). However, given the
difficult business environment, close coordination with the Bank and building on the Bank’s efforts to
address many of the constraints is even more important. IFC’s development objectives in Albania during
the current CAS (FY06-FY09) are to:
(i)
facilitate privatization of strategic sectors and promote private sector investments in infrastructure
sectors through PPP - in close cooperation with the Bank;
(ii) facilitate financial intermediation through introduction of new financial products in the market;
(iii) promote external competitiveness of the economy through promotion and support to local exportoriented companies to become more competitive in the regional market;
(iv) improve investors’ confidence and help increase foreign investment flows;

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
82
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

(v)
(vi)

contribute to reducing petty corruption through facilitating outsourcing of services from public to
private sector;
promote market liberalization through encouraging fair practices and effective competition and
discouraging monopolistic behaviors.

IFC’s strategy targets a broad range of sectors such as financial markets, telecommunications,
infrastructure, social sectors, tourism, and general manufacturing. IFC support will include technical
assistance and advisory services components aimed at improving the investment climate and promoting
private sector development particularly in drafting legislation and advising on strategic privatizations.
In the past, close IDA-IFC cooperation has been instrumental in helping Albania move forward and
achieve impressive results with financial sector privatization. Further collaboration and effective
cooperation between IFC and the Bank will be important for the WBG to play a catalytic role in key
privatizations of strategic sectors and infrastructure development and in implementation of a regulatory
framework enabling sound market competition.
3.1.

Manufacturing and Corporate Sector

Manufacturing remains a priority for IFC operations in Albania. This sector is one of the potential engines
of growth in Albania, as well as other Balkan countries, as became evident from the recent globalization
trends and the shift of manufacturing activities towards developing countries. Manufacturing sector is
likely to attract increasing levels of FDI and in turn will enhance transfer of technology, modern
management, corporate governance, and innovative logistical methods. Albania is expected to improve its
competitiveness to attract FDI into the sector not only because of its labor cost advantages but also
because of the expected improvements in the business environment and political stability.
IFC’s strategic objective is to support competitive export-oriented and/or import-substitution companies
through post-privatization support and through improved access to finance for SMEs. IFC will facilitate
FDI in Albania through debt and equity investment with strategic partners, particularly when a greenfield
project is envisaged. IFC will support post-privatization restructuring in key sectors such as exportoriented companies in agribusiness/food processing and light industry and construction materials. IFC
will continue to play an important role in improving corporate governance, environmental standards and
sharing best practices.
Export promotion is vital for future economic growth and reduction of the large trade deficit. One area in
which IFC and the Bank would jointly explore is the possibility of turning the numerous industrial sites
that were previously owned by state enterprises (and currently privately/publicly owned) into industrial
parks. Many of the sites have existing industrial infrastructure, and with relatively less complicated in
property rights; but they lay idle today. In the meantime, new greenfield investments, including small and
medium sized export oriented manufacturing industries (e.g., textile, food-processing, leather goods, etc.)
that are critically needed cannot take place without availability of specific earmarked sites. This is a
potential area in which Albania could benefit from international best practice (Ireland, Czech Republic,
Singapore, China, etc.) that the WBG (IFC, IDA/IBRD and MIGA) can bring to Albania.
Technical assistance to SME clients in the region is handled increasingly through SEED (Southeast
Europe Enterprise Development), which has been leading IFC's effort to develop and promote the SME
sector in the region. SEED, replaced with the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe (PEP-SE)
in July 2005, will continue to work on improving the business environment for SMEs and helping them to
gain access to finance, developing technical and managerial skills and improve their access to
information. Also, PEP-SE will continue to work on strengthening the institutional and regulatory
framework for EU-oriented competition and industrial polices (See box 1).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
BOX A3.1: SEED (PEP-SE) ALBANIA
The Southeast European Enterprise Development Facility (SEED) is a multi-donor partnership, led by IFC, in
support of SME development in Western Balkans. In 2004, SEED was fully integrated into the IFC regional strategy
by focusing on local implementation of new financing solutions, SME supply chain management advisory work,
supporting the development of business membership organizations, and supporting selected institutions critical to
the development of the private sector. This approach ensures integration of SEED’s products with the needs of key
partners and IFC’s investment strategy. With SEED's mandate completed in June 2005, IFC is currently planning
programs through PEP-SE (started operations in July 2005) that target key private sector development issues such
as: (i) introduction of commercial mediation; (ii) development of a regional recycling supply chain; (iii) introduction
of International and EU manufacturing standards; and (iv) a targeted company level corporate governance program
in the region, whose performance will contribute to improvements in their corporate governance standards. PEP-SE
will continue to place a strong emphasis on the development of sustainable local capacities to support SME
development initiatives in the longer term. Furthermore program roll out will be focused on a specific number of
sectors of critical importance and where the TA has the best opportunity to complement IFC investment activities.

3.1.

Financial Sector

The financial sector in Albania is in private hands. Despite recent increases in bank lending in 2004, the
level of banking intermediation in Albania remains one of the lowest in Europe. While the legal,
institutional and supervisory framework for the financial sector is in line with international practices,
implementation remains weak, especially in the insurance sector. Financial intermediation suffers from a
business environment not conductive to robust and sound lending practices. Enterprises are characterized
by poor transparency and disclosure of financial information. Financial reporting is generally unreliable.
Uncertainty of property rights hinders secured lending. Judicial procedures for collateral enforcement are
weakened by poor performance of court bailiffs and auction procedures. Lack of credit information on
borrowers continues to be an impediment to access to finance.
Banks appear to be very liquid. IFC, rather than providing just financing, will thus focus on encouraging
and helping financial institutions to develop new products. IFC intents to help the banks with leasing,
renewable energy finance products, housing finance, and derivative products involving swaps to support
long-term local currency loans, just to mention a few. Further to the strengthening of the INSIG position,
IFC will also work with the Government and the EBRD to identify a strategic partner so as to privatize
the Company as soon as possible.
The expansion of private sector credit especially to SMEs has been slow. Midsize companies, new
entrepreneurs, and small businesses remain largely dependent on self-finance, while the banking sector
still offers limited products, short maturities and at relatively high costs. IFC will continue to support
SMEs through helping the financial sector to develop new products targeting SMEs, through provision of
micro finance, local capacity building, and business environment improvement conducive to SME
development. IFC has so far invested directly in a number of micro-finance banks and will continue to be
in the forefront of promoting micro-finance in the region. In Albania, IFC supported ProCredit Bank
which has been successful in helping the microfinance business for entrepreneurs with limited access to
credit from the banking system.
3.2.

Infrastructure

Improving infrastructure in Albania will be important to support the country’s economic growth and its
regional integration. Infrastructure development through private sector participation will be a key priority
of IFC’s strategy. Lack of financing to infrastructure and lack of reform in the sector add to the existing
bottlenecks to sustainable growth and private sector development. Albania’s competitiveness and
sustainable development is being undermined due to high transport costs, still recurrent power shortages,
and problematic access and quality of sanitation. So far, private sector interest in investing in

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
84
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

infrastructure in Western Balkans, including in Albania, has been limited. Therefore, IFC will work
closely with the Government and the Bank to attract private sector financing in the infrastructure sectors
through public-private partnership (PPP). The PPP structure might be helpful in improving the risk
perception of infrastructure transaction in Albania by mitigating different components of the risk in a
project. IFC and the Bank will have a joint comprehensive approach to transparency and competition
policy in infrastructure including close coordination between the regulators and the anti-monopoly
authority.
IFC’s will focus on promoting private sector investments in power, telecom, transport, and water sectors.
Pursuing the opportunities to implement the PPP approach, as a way to attract private sector in
infrastructure, IFC expects to see some tangible results in Albania in the near future. In cooperation with a
number of donors, IFC established PEP-SE infrastructure to help public sector entities in Western
Balkans attract private investment, particularly in energy, transport and water and sanitation (see Box
A3.2). In addition, the recent grants from PPIAF to the Ministries of Transport and Territorial Adjustment
to design the framework for public-private partnerships in the highway and water supply sectors will
assist private provision of infrastructure.
BOX A3.2: BALKAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
A poor and unreliable infrastructure continues to discourage private investors and hinder economic growth in the
Balkan region. In turn, slower economic growth reduces the availability of government funds to improve
infrastructure. To break this cycle, IFC established PEP-SE Infrastructure in cooperation with a number of donors.
The activity will help public sector entities in the Southeast Europe to attract private sector investments in
infrastructure, focusing on the energy, transportation, and water and sanitation sectors. It reflects the World Bank
Group strategy to broaden engagement in this sector to ensure efficient, affordable, and sustainable delivery of
infrastructure services. The activity will help identify, develop, structure, and reach financial closure on
infrastructure projects, so that committed public sector entities can engage more effectively with the private sector
and attract investments critical to the region’s economic development. This activity will start operating in FY06.

3.3.1.

Power Sector:

Despite the substantial progress achieved since 2001 in improving the performance of the power sector,
the sector still suffers from significant inefficiencies linked to electricity theft, high technical losses, and
non-payment of dues. In addition, electricity supply is constrained by insufficient domestic capacity and
import transmission constraints. Notwithstanding recent progress made in initiating restructuring of the
sector, the state power company (KESH) still needs further institutional and managerial support. The
power sector has been capital-constrained for many years and needs significant investment for
rehabilitation, upgrading and addition of new capacity. Continuing financial assistance by donors, which
has been substantial so far, will continue to be necessary but by itself will be inadequate to meet total
capital needs. Neither KESH nor GoA has adequate resources to meet these capital needs. Traditional
solutions to this situation include the restructuring of the sector to attract private sector involvement in
both generation and distribution thorough appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks, restructuring of
KESH through unbundling into separate distribution, transmission and generation enterprises and
establishing a modern and competitive electricity market with clear rules for financial settlements.
The GoA, with support from the World Bank and other donors, has been implementing reforms under the
Power Sector Policy Statement, adopted in April 2002. Some of the major achievements have been the
establishment of the Transmission System Operator (TSO) as a joint stock company, development of a
Transitional Market Model, and Market Rules approved by the Regulator. In addition, the Government
and the Regulator are proceeding with implementation of the commitments agreed to under the Athens
MOU in terms of primary and secondary legislation, electricity market implementation, environmental

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
85
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

legislation, and other measures necessary for market opening to support Albania’s integration within the
Energy Community of Southeast Europe (ECSEE) and interconnection with the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) system. The restructuring process of KESH has already
started with allocation of existing assets and liabilities of KESH to the successor companies. The average
tariff has been adjusted annually (estimated at about US$70/per 1,000 kWh in 2005), KESH’s financial
performance for 2004 has been strong with a pre-tax profit (unaudited) of US$ 83 million, compared to
US$ 51 million in 2003, and the collection and losses targets have been met.
IFC shares the Government’s objective of increasing private sector participation in the power sector as
soon as conditions permit to do so. A study, financed by IDA, is underway and this will provide
recommendations on a number of critical issues, such as the number of distribution and generation
companies to be created on unbundling of KESH, degree of separation of the wire and supply side of the
distribution functions, developing appropriate incentive mechanisms to ensure that the required
investments are made after privatization, nature of privatization (sale of assets, concessions, management
contract), sequence and schedule of privatization, etc. The Government will embark on preparation of a
detailed privatization strategy of the sector after consideration of the recommendation of the study.
IFC will look for opportunities to support the privatization in power sector offering its advisory service as
well as its financing, possibly combined with a guarantee instrument from the Bank to cover for political
and regulatory risks. In addition, IFC would consider financing new power generation investments,
subject to being satisfied with the strategic investor as well as financial and economic viability of the
investments.
3.3.2.

Telecommunications:

During the last CAS period, IFC has showed its commitment and readiness to help the government with
the restructuring and privatization of the state run company Albtelecom. With the Government relaunching of the privatization of Albtelecom, IFC would consider post-privatization financing for
Albtelecom, subject to satisfaction with the strategic investor as well as with the financial and economic
viability of the investments.
Improving legal and regulatory framework is crucial for the future development of the sector and
successful privatization of Albtelecom. Key to success in opening telecommunications markets to
competition is the establishment of an independent regulatory body. Accordingly, IFC has initiated and
mobilized, in coordination with the Bank and EBRD, a technical assistance to support
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). IFC is helping to implement a needs assessment of the
additional skills, human resources and organizational changes necessary to ensure that TRA has the
capacity to effectively oversee policy changes and structural reforms leading to the liberalization of the
sector. This work is expected to be followed by other technical assistance support and will be monitored
closely by the relevant government bodies.
3.3.3.

Transportation:

Albania is a natural transit route between Western Balkans and EU Member States. The elimination of
border crossing obstacles in land transport, ports, as well as oil/gas pipeline projects calls for harmonized
regional investments with potential involvement from the private sector. With a regional integration
approach strategy in mind, IFC will follow any developments and look for opportunities to facilitate
private sector involvement especially in port and pipeline projects.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
86
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

3.3.4.

Water and Sanitation:

Although 80% of Albania’s urban population has access to piped water, the supply is intermittent, and the
quality of drinking water is far below internationally accepted standards. Inadequate maintenance and
repairs and the absence of metering and operational control have resulted in water losses of over 50% of
water production in most cities. The situation in rural areas is worse: access to piped water supply has
decreased from 75% in 1989 to 50% today, and areas without piped supply rely on heavily contaminated
sources. Unreliable water supply and the pollution of beach areas by raw sewage is a major obstacle for
the development of tourism.
IDA has been helping the government to develop its National Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Strategy and to focus on increasing private provision of these services. IFC will explore ways to approach
municipal financing also through public-private partnership to attract private operators with a focus in the
city of Tirana, the capital of Albania.
3.4.

Outsourcing Services to the Private Sector

In an effort to bolster quality and efficiency of services, Albanian Government is currently considering
outsourcing certain services to private companies. The first major candidates include the customs
administration and payment systems. The Government hopes to outsource revenue collections and
payment systems services to private contractors to facilitate trade, increase the transparency and reduce
corruption. It is currently looking into successful models implemented in other countries. Similarly, IFC
can help the outsourcing of services to the private sector through methodical and transparent approaches
in areas such as land titles and certification, issuance of ID and passports, income tax calculation and
collection, payroll management, motor vehicle registration and licensing, driver license issuance etc. The
outsourcing of some of these services can invigorate the service market in Albania and will reduce public
spending, red tape, corruption and will increase the satisfaction of citizens and clients.
Also, Albanian government is exploring ways to make best use of country’s scarce resources to improve
health care services for public patients under the national health insurance system. The government
strategy is to explore the additional opportunities that the private sector offers through public-private
partnership in the health sector. Albania has some experience in this area, having previously outsourced
limited ancillary services at several hospital locations. Following IFC’s successful PPP advisory mandates
for outsourcing selected healthcare services and strengthening of the strategic purchasing capabilities of
the national health insurance house, the government initiated a dialogue with IFC to explore opportunities
to further develop PPPs in the health sector. This dialogue is ongoing.

MIGA PROGRAM TO DATE

The outstanding guarantee portfolio of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in Albania
consists of two contracts with a total gross and net exposure of US$ 8.6 million. One contract is in the
tourism sector and the other in the financial sector. Net exposure in Albania is equivalent to 0.3% of
MIGA’s net exposure. On the technical assistance side, MIGA has provided in FY03-04 capacity building
support to ANIH (the Albanian Foreign Investment Promotion Agency). Activities included training on
investment promotion skills and assistance in establishing an on-line marketing presence and developing
marketing materials. ANIH is currently one of the partner organizations participating in MIGA’s
European Investor Outreach Program, a regional initiative to promote foreign investment into the Western
Balkans region.

MIGA’S NON-GUARANTEE TA: THE EUROPEAN INVESTOR OUTREACH PROGRAM (EIOP)

The European Investor Outreach Program has been established by MIGA to promote Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR of Macedonia,
Serbia and Montenegro). Under this initiative, a project office has been established in Vienna, staffed
with MIGA’s investment promotion specialists. Acting as a partner to potential investors, the office
provides full support to companies through all phases of their investment. It delivers information and
investment facilitation services on a confidential basis and free of charge.
2.1.

EIOP Information and Research Services

The Western Balkans is a dynamic region for investment with an improving economic outlook and
overall business climate. However, up to now, the lack of relevant, sector-specific information about
investment opportunities and conditions in the region has been a major challenge for companies interested
in investing in the region.
To overcome this lack of information, EIOP has conducted an extensive study on doing business in the
region. The study will provide potential investors with the kinds of information they find most useful
when making site selection decisions: high-quality information on operating cost and conditions in each
country. Moreover, the countries of the region will be benchmarked as site locations, both against each
other and against the most important competing countries, for example, the new EU member states.
The findings of this study will be available in the form of sector briefs for selected sectors with the
highest potential for investment. EIOP will present these findings to interested investors free of charge.
Moreover, EIOP can assist potential investors in identifying site options and in assessing the optimum site
location within the region.

2.2.

EIOP Facilitation Services

The EIOP offers a number of investment facilitation services to help potential investors in making their
investments in the target region a success:
• Close cooperation with investment promotion agencies: The EIOP works very closely with the
national and local investment promotion agencies in the region to help ensure a top quality
support service to prospective investors at all stages of the investment process;
• Network of key contacts in the target region: The EIOP draws upon a network of high-quality
contacts in all the countries of the target region. EIOP uses this network to ensure that the needs
of a potential investor are fully understood by government officials at the national and local
levels;
• Assistance in risk mitigation tools: The EIOP can provide potential investors with access to risk
mitigation tools via its extensive network of contacts among national and international providers
(MIGA) of political and commercial risk insurance;
• Assistance in the sourcing of finance: The EIOP can introduce potential investors to additional
sources of finance, if required. The program links companies to national as well as international
providers of finance (e.g. European Development Finance Institutions, EBRD and IFC).

ANNEX 5: CAS CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH
1.

CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH

1.
Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CAS. Internally, the whole country
team (both in headquarters as well as in the Country Office) has been actively involved in the preparation
of the strategy including IFC and MIGA members of the team. This was assisted by the support of OPCS,
PREM, SFRCR, FRM, OED and various other networks.
2.
In Albania, the Country Office has embarked on consultations with all stakeholders since late
2004. The team started the consultation process by preparation and completion of a Clients Assessment
Survey in December 2004 (see Annex 2 CASCR for the main results of the survey). Some 137
stakeholders from government, parliament, civil society, private sector, media and academic institutions
responded to the questionnaire. The results show increasing appreciation of the World Bank in Albania
(compared with a previous survey in 2001) and overall endorsement of the priority areas of the Bank and
its effectiveness in delivering the support. A special CAS Electronic Discussion Forum has been
established to ensure wider participation of all stakeholders in the CAS preparation. The consultation
meetings have considerably informed both the CASCR and the new strategy.
3.
A CAS government counterpart team (comprising most central and line ministries) has been
formed to guide the preparation of the strategy. The Government team conducted a thorough review of
Bank operations in Albania, their effectiveness as well as the lessons drawn from the decade-and-a-half of
IDA support. They reviewed government’s challenges and priorities in light of the NSSED and presented
a list of priority program of interventions to be supported in the CAS (FY06-09). The Government team
also made an effort to prioritize the various proposals of support presented by line ministries. The final
list of programs and projects were presented to the Bank prior to the July elections. After the finalization
of the results of the elections, the CAS has also been discussed with new Government. These
consultations concluded in a joint retreat with the whole Cabinet in Durres on 12 September 2005. The
new Government endorsed the CAS program and made several requests and suggestions which have been
incorporated in the final version of the CAS.
4.
Consultations with parliamentary commissions and groups have markedly sharpened the focus
of proposed interventions under the CAS06. These consultations started with a large consultative
meeting under the auspices of the Economic Commission, where all members of the commissions, heads
of other commissions as well as leaders of party groups attended. The meeting enabled the team to assess
the national priorities at various stages of CAS preparations as presented by the representatives of all
political parties in Parliament. A special meeting on agriculture, environment and natural resources was
organized on May 9, 2005 under the auspices of the Agriculture Commission of the Parliament.
Parliamentarians praised the Bank’s contribution to the sector in the last 14 years and agreed it was
effective, sustainable and innovative. They stressed the importance of improving donor coordination in
the sector, of integrating various projects to ensure greater synergy in the interventions and to consolidate
or eliminate PIUs. In future, they recommended increased support to rural roads, fisheries, forestry, and
increased coverage of “protected areas”. Finally, the Parliamentarians agreed that the agro-processing
sector has huge potentials for growth and export promotion, subsequently urging the Bank to increase its
support to the sub-sector.
5.
Extensive consultations with major political parties on the CAS program took place in the first
half of 2005. With the parliamentary elections concluded in July 2005, these consultations were critical to
ensure that the support program is focused on national priorities and has the support of all stakeholders.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
91
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Despite the differences in party platforms during the election campaign, the consultations demonstrated
wide consensus on the effectiveness of the Bank support and the priorities of the NSSED. All political
parties stressed on the importance of focusing the new program on governance, rule of law, public
administrative reforms, enhancing the business environment, upgrading of infrastructure (particularly
roads and energy), ensuring establishment of efficient land market and resolving land tenure issues,
natural resources management and further support to the social sector (education, health and social
assistance). Following the announcement of official results of the parliamentary elections, close contact
and consultations with the Democratic Party (DP) also took place.
6.
Two workshops were organized in north Albania (Kukes) and south Albania (Fier) for
representatives of local governments and civil society organizations in the respective regions. The first
consultation meeting with the local government and civil society at the regional level took place on March
18, 2005 at the Municipality of Kukes. Representatives from municipalities, communes, civil society,
media as well as forestry association representatives from northern regions of Albania attended the
meeting. The priorities identified by participants from northeastern Albania include (by order of
priorities): (i) road infrastructure (Durres-Kukes-Morine road in particular); (ii) health services; (iii)
education (all levels from pre-primary levels to secondary education); (iv) urban development;(v) job
creation; (vi) strengthening the citizens’ voice in the decision making process; (vii) natural resources
management (fisheries and forestry in particular) and tourism development and (viii) trade – links to
neighboring countries and country integration. The second regional workshop was organized in Fier on
April 1, 2005. It was attended by representatives of the local government, civil society, women and youth
organizations and media representatives of the major cities of southern Albania. The participants stressed
the importance of more direct support to local government, including fiscal decentralization and direct
crediting, increased support to urban and rural infrastructure, greater emphasis on job creation and
strengthening of administrative capacities of local government, re-forestation and flood protection,
investment in environment protection (in particular in urban areas), greater support to youth, cultural
heritage protection and tourism development as well as feasible efforts for business development and
private sector growth.
7.
An advisory committee from civil society organizations has advised the Bank’s team
throughout the preparation processes. This group was composed of representatives of think tanks, youth,
women, environmental organizations, media associations and regional development agencies (e.g.,
Human Development Promotion Center, Institute of Contemporary Studies, Gender Alliance, Regional
Environmental Center, Albanian Media Institute, Partners-Albania, Youth Council, Majaft Movements,
etc.). Thanks to their long standing cooperation with the Bank and their good understanding of the Bank
mission, policies and operations, group participants provided extended advice and support to the CAS
preparation and the consultation process. The representatives of the group expressed their readiness to
disseminate to various civil society networks the information about new CAS and obtain the necessary
feedback. They appreciated the Bank contribution to the NSSED, governance reforms, and development
efforts in the country. The group stressed the importance of further involvement of their bodies in the
future Bank programs at initial stages starting from the preparation, implementation to the monitoring of
the project results.
8.
Two rounds of consultations with private sector representatives were organized in February
and April 2005. The first meeting on private sector development was organized jointly by the World
Bank Country Office and IFC (including SEED). The participants in the meeting praised the efforts of the
World Bank and exchanged views on actual impediments in the current business environment. They
stressed that limited access to credit and lack of credit information bureau, were among the major
impediments for growth in the private sector. Other participants emphasized the difficulties with regard to
land titles, while few others complained about bureaucratic harassment of tax, custom and other
government authorities. Finally, there were some participants that stressed the impact of increasing state

capture and the cost of corruption. The second consultative meeting with the private sector representatives
took place on April 25, 2005. Participants in this meeting emphasized the importance of export and trade
promotion for the private sector growth. They underscored the importance of improving the business
environment to attract FDI and domestic investment. Representatives of the Banking sector again
suggested that the Bank should support the establishment of a credit bureau. They cited the difficulties
with regard to the bankruptcy and execution of foreclosures that prevent faster provision of credit to the
private sector. Other participants raised concerns about unfair competition and high cost of doing business
stemming from poor infrastructure (transportation, communications and energy). Participants agreed that
tax administration needs be improved. Other impediments that ought to be removed include land
registration, lack of quality and standard certification as well as smuggling.
9.
An Open House for Youth on March 21, 2005 focused on youth priorities and their
expectations for the new CAS on the occasion of the Launching of the Youth, Development and Peace
(YDP) Network. About 29 Youth representatives (from 17 different youth organization; all in the 18-31
age bracket, two-thirds female, 7 from rural areas, as well as youth from Tirana, Fier, Tepelene, Kukes,

Peshkopi, Durres) attended the event. They included representatives from the main Youth
umbrella organizations: the Balkan Youth Link Albania, "Majaft (Enough) Movement", Albanian
Youth Council (representing 99 youth organizations), Albanian Youth Parliament, Women for Global
Action, Center for Integration and Development, Youth Women Christian Association, Regional
Environmental Center, PASS, and YMCA. With regard to the role of the World Bank in Albania in the
new CAS (FY06-FY09), participants suggested the following: (i) increasing support to all levels of
education and revisions of curriculum for quality improvements; (ii) improving health services (both in
term coverage, access and quality); (iii) providing greater support to rural area, to the Northeastern
regions and to local infrastructure particularly roads; (iv) increasing support to urban poor in the informal
settlements; (v) cleaning up of environmental "hot spots"; (vi) supporting the implementation of the
National Youth Strategy and direct support to strengthen youth organizations; (vii) providing greater
outreach to youth organizations in rural area and youth that are not organized; (viii) direct involvement in
employment creation and reversing the brain drain; (ix) efforts to protect youth and children from
trafficking and crime; (x) creating of separate prisons for juveniles; and (xii) paying special attention to
the integration of migrants from the North East in coastal and urban communities.
10.
Two rounds of consultations were organized for donors specifically for the CAS priorities and
donor coordination. On April 21, 2005, development counselors and representatives of most bilateral and
multilateral agencies discussed the new World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for Albania. They all
appreciated the role of the Bank in supporting the process of socioeconomic development in Albania and
the achievements that have been made since early days of transition. The donors also elaborated on the
possibilities for improved coordination among donors, country priorities and the focus of the programs of
each of the participating donors. The participants agreed on the importance of selectivity,
complementarily and information sharing to avoid duplication of efforts and wasting financial resources.
They also stressed the importance of supporting the Integrated Planning System (IPS) and the importance
of encouraging the government to take lead in donor coordination. Donor representatives agreed to
furnish the Bank team with data and information about their development support in Albania. The second
meeting was organized on 21 July 2005 and focused specifically on the results framework and the draft
new result CAS Matrix for FY06-FY09 and the partnerships with regard to the implementation of the
CAS. Participants expressed their agreement to the proposed results, the pillars of the CAS and
particularly the heavy emphasis on governance (Governance filter). They also requested the Bank to play
an active role in donor coordination, the implementation of the IPS and alignment of the NSSED with the
SAp. A number of donors emphasized the importance of collaboration to resolve land registration and
titling issues

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

11.
The Country Office will continue to expand its outreach and communication to strengthen
partnerships in the implementation of the new CAS. The Public Information Center (PIC) has been
relocated to the Library of the Faculty of Economics, University of Tirana in 2005, following the signing
of a partnership agreement with the Faculty. Most of the dissemination activities of the Bank AAA
activities, and the CAS06, will be launched in the new PIC. A quarterly newsletter is now published and
disseminated by the Country office and efforts are underway to establish affiliations with the Global
Distance Learning Network (GDLN). The Bank has also completed an assessment of the legal framework
for civil society organizations and will continue to support its activities through the small grant program
as well as direct involvement in project preparation and monitoring. A communication strategy for the
Country Office has been formulated to expand the Bank outreach activities.

2.

PARTNERSHIPS

12.
In addition to building strong partnership with Albanian stakeholders, the Bank has built
effective partnerships with development partners and donor organizations active in Albania, mainly
through the country office. The European Commission (EC), UNDP and OSCE are the Bank’s key
multilateral partners in Albania with shared responsibilities in donor coordination (joint responsibility in
the Donors Technical Secretariat). As the pace of Albanian integration with the European Union
accelerated, the Bank has started to coordinate most of its activities with the European Commission both
in Albania and in Brussels and specific meetings for CAS preparations have been undertaken to ensure
better alignment of the CAS with the SAp (see Annex 9). The relations with the IMF have been very
effective and strong. The Bank also has worked closely with EBRD and EIB and has co-financed a
number of projects and programs with them. Coordination with the ISDB, OPEC Fund, and Kuwait Fund
has been strong.
13.
With the widening of the circle of Albanian friends, the Bank has also build strong
partnerships with most bilateral donor agencies in Albania. These include, among others: the Italian
Cooperation, The Netherlands, USAID, GTZ, DFID, SNV, SIDA, Swiss Cooperation, and Austrian
Cooperation.

14.

The Bank intends to provide increased support to the implementation of the integrated
planning system (IPS) that the Government of Albania adopted in April 2005 (see Box 2). The IPS calls
for the consolidation of the various policy formulations (NSSED, Sap, MDGs) into an integrated medium
term plan in 2007 with a comprehensive functional classification of the role of the various government
agencies and a consolidated scheme for donor coordination and harmonization. Under the IPS, the GoA is
expected to take leadership role in donor coordination particularly in face of expected decline in
concessional financing to Albania. Under the new donor architecture the Bank will continue to provide
support to 9 thematic groups (education; health; social assistance; infrastructure (transport, energy and
water supply); agriculture and natural resources; private sector development and financial sector; public
finance; and tourism and coastal development). The new Government adopted, in November 2005, a
decision to embark on the implementation of the IPS (including formation of two cabinet committees for
the Strategic Planning and Government Modernization and setting up an IPS Department in the Councils
of Ministers).

ANNEX 8: ALBANIA’S DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
This Annex updates Albania’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). It concludes that, under a base case
scenario of sustained growth, fiscal prudence and low interest rates, public and external debt sustainability
could remain manageable over the medium term. Both solvency and liquidity indicators remain below
standard threshold however, proving that strong and sustained growth and export expansion along with
improved track record of implementing structural reforms would allow Albania to access debt on nonconcessional terms without worsening its solvency or liquidity indicators.

1.

EVOLUTION OF DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT

Albania’s external and domestic debt indicators have improved considerably over time. Overall
public debt has been declining from 71 percent in 2000, to 56.6 percent of GDP at end-2004. Recent
declines have been accelerated by the lek’s appreciation. The public external debt to GDP ratio has
declined from 29 percent in 2000 to a relatively low level of 18.8 percent in 2004. Domestic debt declined
recently largely driven by the use of the proceeds of Savings Bank privatization in 2004 to write off part
of the accumulated domestic debt stock. The latter remains however sizeable at 37.8 percent of GDP at
end 2004.
Substantial forgiveness of external debt in arrears has been the main driver of declining public debt
ratios. Arrears on external debt reached 1 percent of GDP at end 2004 down from a high of 22 percent in
1997. The reduction in arrears took largely the form of debt forgiveness, with a small part being
regularized and converted to external debt. Debt rescheduling agreements have been reached with both
Paris Club creditors (1993, 1998 and 2000) and commercial banks. This was compounded by
improvement in macroeconomic performance under IMF supported programs which helped maintain a
declining trend in the public debt/GDP ratio.

Albania’s overall indebtedness indicators compare favorably to those of its regional peers. The
Government debt to GDP ratio is more relatively in line with that of other countries in the region. It is
also considerably lower than other IBRD countries. Both solvency and liquidity external debt indicators
are much superior for example to those of Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM,
Bulgaria, and Romania. Total external debt service amounts only to 2.4 percent of total exports of goods
and services (including remittances), while the ratio of NPV of external debt to GNI and to exports is

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
97

much lower than other neighboring countries. In addition to the low debt level, Albania is characterized
by a relatively high ratio of concessional debt to total external debt of 72 percent. Most of the external
debt is due to multilateral creditors, the largest being the World Bank, followed by the IMF and EIB.

MAIN RESULTS OF DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS.

Under the base case scenario, public debt sustainability continues to improve, albeit at a slow pace.
Fiscal financing needs are primarily driven by the rolling over of existing short-term domestic debt.
However, with increased reliance on longer-maturity domestic debt and increasing fiscal consolidation
over time, the gross financing gap decreases and financing sources become increasingly dominated by
government revenue. This positive picture is reinforced by the improving public debt ratios over this
period. In particular, total public debt/GDP ratio declines from 56.6 percent in 2004 to 53.5 percent in
2009. The decline in the debt trajectory is moderate since Albania continues to run fiscal deficits, though
at lower levels, and needs to finance its capital investments with higher cost new borrowing.
External debt sustainability is maintained at relatively stable levels over the CAS period, only
worsening slightly in outer years, and both solvency and liquidity indicators remain well below
standard sustainability thresholds. The ratio of total external debt to GDP is projected to remain stable
between 18 to 19% by 2009, but remains significantly below standard solvency thresholds,25 suggesting
that the base case macroeconomic framework satisfies the long-run sustainability condition. Liquidity
pressure remains at low levels due to a small external debt stock and prolonged grace periods currently
applied. The ratio of TDS to exports is projected to stabilize at around 2.5 percent in 2009.
Given that IBRD’s current and projected exposure to Albania is very limited, and that Albania has
established a strong record of servicing Bank debt, exposure indicators are projected to improve
over the CAS period. IBRD exposure is low measured on a per capita basis or as a share of GDP or
25

The World Bank uses two ratios to classify countries annually based on their external indebtedness: the NPV of external debtto-GDP and the NPV of external debt service to exports of goods and services. If either ratio exceeds its critical value (80 percent
and 220 percent respectively), the country is classified as heavily indebted. Moderately indebted means either of the two key
ratios exceeds 60 percent, but does not reach the critical levels. All other classified low- and middle-income economies are listed
as less indebted. See also Part III of the IMF (2003)” “External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users”, International
Monetary Fund, Washington DC.

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
98
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

exports, and IBRD debt accounts for a negligible share of Albania’s total debt outstanding. Debt service
ratios are also favorable. IBRD debt service to exports of goods and services is projected to increase
moderately over the CAS period but remains low at less than 0.1 percent. Bank debt service as a share of
total public debt service is projected to increase from 10.6% in 2004 to 16% in 2009. The share of IBRD
debt in Albania’s total debt outstanding is projected to reach 2.3 percent in 2009 and 5 percent of total
World Bank portfolio.
These projections rely on continued strong macroeconomic management and policy performance,
conservative assumptions regarding privatization proceeds, and a medium-term balance of payments
outlook based on moderately favorable assumptions regarding trade growth and capital inflows. Albania’s
fiscal and external sustainability in the medium term under the base-case lending scenario depends on: (i)
furthering ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts, improving the quality of fiscal adjustment and raising
revenue collections; (ii) substantially improving the strategic management of debt; (iii) strong policy
reform supporting improved export performance, especially through removing administrative barriers to
investment and improving public sector governance, and (iv) a relatively favorable external environment
that would help boost export growth.
Sensitivity Analysis:
Public debt sustainability indicators were found to be most vulnerable to a loose fiscal stance. A
higher fiscal deficit due to lower tax revenues (unmatched by expenditure cuts) leads to close to doubling
the overall fiscal deficit compared to the base case scenario (5 percent compared to 3 percent of GDP).
Since public borrowing increases, solvency indicators for public debt deteriorate markedly over time.
These results emphasize the need for continued fiscal consolidation that, combined with a reduced
reliance on domestic financing, will help ease the pressure on the domestic credit market and facilitate a
reduction in domestic rates.
The effect of higher interest rates on overall indebtedness levels is less strong. Everything else
staying the same, a one percentage point increase in the domestic interest rate compared to the base case
scenario widens the overall deficit only slightly and raises public sector borrowing requirements. With a
smaller share of the deficit being financed by domestic borrowing, the impact of the shock would taper
off gradually. Without deteriorating, solvency and liquidity indicators do not improve as fast as in the
base case. Other risks that have not been simulated, but that constitute sources of vulnerability on the
domestic debt side are the short maturity structure of public debt, the high concentration of debt
ownership (in the banking system), the low quality of the fiscal adjustment, and lack of market
arrangements for public debt management. These give rise to liquidity and rollover risk that need to be
mitigated.
External debt sustainability indicators are most sensitive to an adverse shock to exports. Due to the
high historical variability in export growth, a temporary reduction by half in annual base case export
growth during 2007-2008 would sharply deteriorate external sustainability leading to a one-off increase in
the external debt/GDP ratio that approaches critical thresholds. External sustainability would decline from
both a solvency and liquidity perspective. Debt service ratios would deteriorate markedly, with an
increasing share of the lower export earnings going to service the debt. This shock confirms the
imperative to significantly raise exports, including through diversifying its export base, in view of
boosting growth, and reducing reliance on migrants’ transfers.
Other potentially important determinants of debt sustainability were also examined, but were
found to be less significant on the external debt side. Variables such as the level of foreign interest
rates and the proportion of future non-concessional financing were also analyzed. Given the relatively low

Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes
99
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

share of external debt, these shocks were found to be relatively less important sources of vulnerability
within a 10-year horizon.

For Albania to minimize its exposure to external shocks and ensure sustainability of its public and
external debt, it will need to improve the quality of its fiscal adjustment by further strengthening its
revenue generation capacity and improving the efficiency of its capital spending; improving the business
environment, and removing obstacles to exports stemming from poor infrastructure and institutional
quality. This will need to be accompanied by a financing and debt management strategy that would alter
the size, terms and composition of its domestic debt, improve the functioning of government securities
markets and actively take measures to gradually access market based lending on favorable terms.

ANNEX 9: ALBANIA’S RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND PROGRESS ON THE SAP
Relations between Albania and the European Union (EU) have been developing in the context of the
Stabilization and Association process (SAp). As such, the SAp is a framework in which a new contractual
relationship (Stabilization and Association Agreements) and an assistance program (CARDS)26 help each
country in the Western Balkans to progress, at its own pace towards EU membership.27
The idea of a SAp as a new and genuine tool of anchoring the countries from the Western Balkans
towards the EU was born at the Zagreb Summit in November 2000, after the Feira Council of June 2000
that addressed the future of the Balkans countries is in Europe.28 In Zagreb, the Western Balkan countries
made a pledge to abide by the EU rules and conditionality, receiving in return the prospect for EU
accession based on the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and the Copenhagen criteria as well as on
assistance program to promote and support this ambition.29 They also agreed that when signed, the
Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs) would be the principal means to begin preparing
themselves for the demands that the prospect of accession to the EU entails.30 In addition, the countries
agreed (once they meet the necessary rules and conditions) to receive financial assistance (CARDS),
which would focus on supporting necessary reforms and institution building, and thus facilitate their
approximation with the EU.
Since 1991, successive Albanian governments have placed the prospect of European integration at the top
of their agendas. In fact, integration in the EU has been the only overarching national interest in Albania
because of lack of broader national consensus on other development challenges, due to political rivalry.
Although Albania signed a Co-operation and Trade Agreement with the EU in 1992, the civil unrest in
1997 (the so-called “pyramid schemes crisis”), delayed further development of relations between the EU
and Albania. In 1999, the European Commission (EC) presented a Feasibility Report, which concluded
that, despite progress made since the 1997 crisis, Albania was not yet in a position to take on the far
reaching contractual obligations with the EU.31
In November 2000, the EU decided at the Zagreb summit to set up an EU/Albania High Level Steering
Group (HLSG), with the objective of stepping up cooperation between the EU and Albania, and
identifying and supporting reforms to be carried out by Albania in preparation for negotiation of a SAA.
The EU/Albania HLSG was asked to assess progress, to recommend necessary reform measures and to
provide advice and guidance in the areas of concern outlined in the 1999 Feasibility Report, and to report
26

The European Council in Feira confirmed that its objective remained fullest possible integration of the countries in the region
into the political and economic mainstream of Europe through the SAp, political dialogue, liberalization of trade and cooperation
in Justice and Home Affairs. http://www.euoparl.eu.int/summits/fei1_en.htm.
29
The European Council in Copenhagen 1993 spelled out the Copenhagen criteria, by which candidate countries would be
judged for accession on: (i) stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and
protection of minorities; (ii) existence of a functioning market economy, as well as capacity to cope with competitive pressure
and market forces within the EU; and (iii) ability to take on obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of
political, economic and monetary union – i.e. the acquis communautaire.
30
Engineered similarly to the Europe Agreements that were signed between the EU and the 10 countries of Central and Eastern
Europe at the beginning of 1990, the SAAs focus on respect for democratic principles and integration of the countries of the
region into the EU single market. They foresee the establishment of a free trade area with the EU and set out rights and
obligations in areas such as competition and state aid rules, intellectual property and establishment, which will allow the
economies of the region to begin to integrate with the EU. The conclusion of such Agreements represents the signatories’
commitment to complete over a transition period a formal association with the EU, tailored to the circumstances of each country
but based on the implementation of the same core obligations.

to the European Council by mid-2001. Based upon the report prepared by the HSLG, the EC concluded
that, taking into account political, economic, regional and SAA-related technical factors, it is appropriate
to proceed with negotiations for a SAA with Albania.32 The Gothenburg European Council of June 2001
welcomed the EC’s report and invited the EC to present draft negotiating directives to the Council for the
negotiation of an SAA with Albania. The directives were finally adopted 2002. On January 31, 2003 the
President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, officially launched the negotiations for a SAA.
Negotiations on a draft SAA began in early 2003. Since then three official rounds (including member
states representatives) and five technical rounds of negotiations have been held with the Albanian
authorities. Agreement in principle has now been reached on most elements of the text of the draft
agreement.33 However, actual implementation of reforms has been insufficient to properly address many
of the shortcomings identified in the 2001 High Level Steering Group report, subsequent SAp reports, and
in the framework of the regular dialogue between the EC and Albania.34 In fact, the SAp reports reveal
that most of the recommendations from 2002 were not implemented and thus carried over to 2003, while
only a limited number of policy recommendations in the 2003 SAp report and the various Consultative
Task Force meetings have been fully implemented.35 According to the 2004 SAp report, Albania does not
yet offer a sufficient guarantee that it will be capable of correctly implementing the future SAA36
The 2005 SAp Progress Report, however, highlighted that progress been made in Albania on economic
and political developments and in meeting European standards. It recognized that Albania has made
progress in reinforcing its democratic, judicial and public administration institutions but needs to
implement strategies and laws with more vigor to improve their functioning. It assessed Parliamentary
elections as been conducted in line with the Electoral Code and that they adhered to fundamental
democratic principles, leading to smooth transfer of power. The 2005 Progress Report also recognized
that Albania made progress in improving the oversight, recruitment and training of the civil service and
taken steps to enhance its legal framework and to make public administration more robust. Proper
implementation of the existing legislative framework and the overall effective functioning of the judicial
system remain a matter of concern to the EC despite some efforts made to fight corruption.37
The 2005 SAp Progress Report also concluded that Albania operates to some degree within the
framework of functioning market principles. Further vigorous reform efforts are, however, necessary to
address the shortcoming in competitiveness of the economy (weak infrastructure, poor legislation, weak
implementation of tax legislation, unfair competition by business operating in the grey economy, etc.).
The report also recognized that Albania has made progress towards meeting European standards. Progress
has been mainly through adoption of new legislation and establishment of new institutions. But in a
number of cases, more commitment and resources are needed for further progress and implementation.
In order for Albania to make meaningful progress in the SAp, the progress reports assess that major
reforms are necessary in the following areas: (i) fighting organized crime, trafficking and corruption; (ii)
strengthening the judicial system and public administration; (iii) ensuring the proper functioning of
democracy (including elections) and preserving the political stability necessary for speedy reform
implementation; (iv) improvement in terms of human and minority rights; (v) further formalization and
reform of the economy, as well as increased fiscal sustainability through more efficient customs and tax
administrations and a strengthened legal framework.

The SAp was further deepened with the Thessaloniki Council of June 2003, which reiterated the EU’s
determination to fully and effectively support the European prospects of the Western Balkan countries.
The Council also introduced a new tool aimed at approximating the countries in the region with the EU –
the European Partnership. The Council decision approving a European Partnership for Albania was
published in June 2004. The Albanian Government adopted its Action Plan for the Implementation of
European Partnership Priorities in September 2004 and provided the Commission with updates on its
progress in implementing the Action Plan in December 2004 and March 2005.
The European Partnership for Albania is based on the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No.
533/2004. It is modeled on the Accession Partnerships developed to prepare past aspirants to EU
membership. It defines short and medium term priorities for Albania’s preparations for further integration
with the EU identified in the EC’s 2004 Annual Report, and serves as a checklist against which to
measure progress. The priorities specified in the European Partnership are adapted to Albania’s specific
needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. The European Partnership also provides
guidance for financial assistance to Albania through the CARDS program.38
The 2005 SAp Progress Report also made an assessment about progress in implementation of the
European Partnership. It concluded that “overall, Albania had made some progress in implementing the
European Partnership’s short-term priorities, but has not yet began to address concertedly those set out for
the medium term”.39 While new laws have been enacted and new institutions been created, slow
implementation, and in few cases lack of political will, have been the main factors behind the slow pace
of progress. The main remaining challenges facing Albania include:
•

In the political field, priority should be given to better parliamentary rules and creation of a more
constructive political climate. Judicial transparency should be fostered and the civil service law
should be fully implemented. Albania should ensure that its strategy to fight corruption is realistic
and precise. Further efforts are required also to complete the legal and administrative framework
for the protection of minorities.

•

In the area of economic management, priority should be given to certainty of property
ownership. Albania also need to secure that it will be able to fulfill its future SAA obligation with
regard to non-discriminatory application of business law for EU companies, improve commercial
legislation and provide more resource to its SME agency and make progress in the business
environment.

•

Finally, in the area of European Standards, measure to increase awareness of the importance
European standards among economic actors needs to be adopted. Fighting corruption, smuggling
and trafficking by the custom service should receive a higher priority. Public procurement need to
be improved both legislatively and in terms of building administrative capacity. Albania also
needs to raise awareness of intellectual property rights among economic operators and law
enforcement agencies.

The EU is currently rationalizing the pre-accession aid. In September 2004, the European Commission
proposed a Regulation that creates a single framework for assistance: the Instrument for Pre-Accession
(IPA). Under the draft IPA Regulation, assistance for potential candidate countries such as Albania will
remain very much the same as currently under CARDS, i.e., similar sectors and same kind of operations:
(i) institution building and democratization; (ii) economic and social development; (iii) regional and
cross-border cooperation; and (iv) partial alignment with the acquis communautaire, in particular where

this is in the mutual interest of the EU and the beneficiary country. Project management responsibilities
under IPA may be decentralized to the local administration, but this is likely to be done gradually.
Over the period 1991-2004, the EC assistance to Albania had totalled about € 1.2 billion, of which € 635
million was delivered through the Phare program. Since 2001, CARDS has been the main EC financial
instrument for Albania. The support provided through CARDS in 2005 (€ 44.2) is mainly focused on
European partnership priorities.
