EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
Despite the advantages of political stability, location, language, time zone and natural
resource endowments, Jamaica’s development gains remain low. Notably, during 1973-2007,
Jamaica recorded annual output growth of 0.8 percent, and a decline in average labor
productivity by 1.5 percent per annum. In comparison, output increased by 4.2 percent in
comparable middle-income countries with concurrent productivity growth.
2.
Nevertheless, Jamaica has recorded a number of positive achievements. First, the
country consolidated economic liberalization efforts and gradually recovered from a major
financial crisis in 1995-97. The country now has a relatively stable and well-capitalized financial
sector, albeit not free of systemic risk. Second, Jamaica significantly reduced the incidence of
poverty, in part because of poverty reduction interventions and growth in remittances. The
national poverty rate fell from 28.4 percent in 1989 to 9.9 percent in 2007. Third, the country
was among the pioneers in initiating surveys for evidence-based policy decisions.
3.
Jamaica is vulnerable to climate change and this is compounded by the global
economic crisis and longstanding structural issues. Jamaica is one of the countries that show
the highest exposure to risk in not only the Caribbean but also globally. This exposure to risk
underscores the need to support Jamaica in integrating climate change adaptation measures into
core development programs across sectors, and targeting specific hazards, particularly hazardous
or vulnerable places and people within the coastal zones, and the urban and rural poor.
4.
The current global crisis has seriously affected Jamaica, and its impacts are likely to
persist over the medium term. Output is projected to decline for the second year, by another
3.5 percent in FY09/10, largely due to the collapse of the bauxite industry and reductions in
remittances and tourism receipts. As a result, government revenue collections fell and the fiscal
deficit is projected to be twice the budgeted level for FY09/10. Significant support is needed
from the multilateral institutions to avert serious economic consequences.
5.
Longstanding structural issues include: (i) high debt ratio that hinders government
ability to provide quality services and foster development; (ii) low level of trust in society; (iii)
low level of formal training among the labor force; (iv) excessive cost of electricity that affects
the economy’s competitiveness and the welfare of the population; (v) significantly higher
unemployment rates among the youth and females; (vi) high incidence of crime and violence;
and (vii) vulnerability of infrastructure and housing stocks to windstorms and earthquakes.
6.
An important gender issue in Jamaica is that boys tend to underperform girls in
school and engage in risky behaviors from early on. These behaviors are linked to crime and
violence and other structural gender issues such as teenage pregnancy and gender based violence.
Jamaica has registered significant progress in women’s economic and political empowerment as
well as reproductive health. Although there is still a long way to go in terms of empowering
women, it is hard to make progress without directly addressing the issue of boys at risk.
7.
Jamaica is working towards addressing short-term crisis and long-term development
challenges with support from a 27-month IMF program and budgetary support from the World
Bank and other development partners. The longer-term strategy is based on a Vision 2030
i

National Development Plan document with six national outcomes and five supporting national
outcomes.
8.
The Jamaica-World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (FY10-13) focuses
on three development pillars (see Annex 2). The three pillars are anchored to: (i) the country’s
own medium-term framework (MTF); (ii) opportunities for deeper partnerships with other
international development partners to pull resources for a meaningful impact on selected national
outcomes; (iii) the recommendations of the CAS Completion Report; and (iv) the lessons from
the ongoing projects; . Overall, Bank support is expected to include two or three DPLs, six
investment loans and seven analytical activities, reflecting a deeper engagement sought by the
government elected in September 2007. The Bank will seek to extend collaboration with other
development partners to multiply and complement the impacts of its own funded activities. The
IFC will focus on investment climate, financial market development, and access to finance,
infrastructure, tourism and emerging sectors in health, education and information technology.
9.
The first pillar is to support economic stability through fiscal and debt sustainability that
entail two policy-based loans in the current CPS period. The budgetary support will be
complemented with analytical and advisory services, including Trust Fund grants, and,
potentially, an associated TA loan to support reform implementation in an expeditious manner.
10.
The second pillar is to promote inclusive growth through three result areas: (i)
strengthening human capital. This is an area for Bank and IFC synergies which includes PublicPrivate Partnerships in the context of projects to support a bipartisan education strategy for
education transformation and skills for inclusive growth. These projects will be complemented
with a poverty assessment, and regional studies on labor markets (nurse migration) and noncommunicable diseases; (ii) crime and violence prevention with a project informed by lessons of
the ongoing inner cities project and the accompanying JSDF Grant on crime and violence. A
country social assessment will also be undertaken; (iii) promotion of rural development with a
recently approved rural economic development initiative, technical assistance with agricultural
risk management and a disaster risk reduction JSDF grant. IFC will emphasize private sector
investments improving economic conditions for Base of the Pyramid segments of the population.
11.
The third pillar is to promote sustained growth through: (i) strengthening non-labor
competitiveness with IFC and Bank collaboration on an energy program, investment climate,
regional communications, transport and logistics. An infrastructure study will help to better
understand the linkages between public capital and private investments for development; and (ii)
climate resilience and vulnerability reduction through a JSDF landslide risk reduction grant, a
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (with IDB) and a country environment assessment.
12.
The cross-cutting theme of governance will seek to achieve more efficient financial
management and allocation of budget expenditures to achieve results.
13.
There are substantial risks from (i) current economic crisis; (ii) natural disasters; (iii)
political environment of a two seats Parliamentary majority; (iv) country fiduciary systems; (v)
governance and crime; and (vi) institutional weaknesses for reforms. The risks are mitigated by
the government or concerted effort by international development partners, including the Bank. In
addition, following the extraordinary level of budgetary support to Jamaica proposed in this CPS,
there is a risk that the Bank would not be in a position to provide support in the future if Jamaica
ii

were to face acute and large financing needs either because of lack of sufficient follow through
in implementing critical reforms or because of external shocks.
14.

In its discussion, the Board may wish to consider the following:
(i)

Given the Bank’s available financing in Jamaica, does the proposed strategy represent
the most appropriate role the Bank can perform to support the government’s strategy?

(ii)

Does the Country Partnership Strategy adequately identify the risks to the successful
implementation of the Bank program?

JAMAICA-WORLD BANK GROUP
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY, FY10-13
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Jamaica, the largest English-speaking Caribbean country, enjoys natural
beauty that attracts more tourists every year than its population of 2.7 million and is
in close proximity to large trading partners. It has the seventh largest natural harbor in
the world and is only one hour and twenty minutes by air from Miami.
2.
Despite advantages of location, language, time zone and natural resource
endowments, Jamaica’s development progress has been low. During 1973-2007,
annual average growth was 0.8 percent while labor productivity declined by 1.5 percent.
The country consolidated economic liberalization efforts and gradually recovered from a
major financial crisis in 1995-97. However, public investment has been constrained by
the need to service a large debt stock, and public trust has eroded in public institutions
because of the high levels of youth unemployment, violent crime, and corruption.
3.
Achieving a higher path of development, reduced economic volatility, and
greater social stability is urgent and has become more complex. The 2009 financial
crisis has negatively impacted tourism receipts, remittances and the bauxite industry.
Together with a high debt overhang, the country is severely constrained as it seeks to
undertake needed policies to overcome the crisis and protect past social gains.
4.
In addition, Jamaica remains vulnerable to natural disasters. The country
lies at the edge of the hurricane track and experiences direct hits and indirect storm
damages. Damages from the three major recent storms, for example, exceeded US$1
billion, resulting in a heavy fiscal burden, increased indebtedness, and redirection of
resources from medium-term development plans. The country also lies in an earthquake
zone.
5.
Jamaica, like other Caribbean nations, is highly vulnerable to global climate
change. While the severities of the impacts vary from sector to sector, there is a suite of
priority concerns directly linked to climate change that is virtually ubiquitous across the
country. The key impacts that are already manifesting in Jamaica with negative
consequences for critical sectors of the economy include: increased droughts and floods;
sea level rise leading to accelerated coastal erosion; increased flood risk and loss of land;
saline intrusion into coastal aquifers; increased destructiveness of tropical storms; loss of
protective coastal systems, such as coral reefs partly due to higher ocean surface
temperatures; and loss of livelihoods, especially those dependent on tourism and
fisheries.
6.
Also, like other English-speaking Caribbean countries, an important gender
issue in Jamaica is that boys tend to underperform girls in school and engage in
risky behaviors from early on. These behaviors are linked to crime and violence, and
other structural gender issues such as teenage pregnancy and gender based violence.
Jamaica has registered significant progress in women’s economic and political
empowerment as well as reproductive health. Although there is still a long way to go in

1

terms of empowering women, it is hard to make progress without directly addressing the
issue of boys at risk and masculinity.
7.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10-13 aims to contribute to
government efforts to set the country on a path of greater economic and social
stability, and inclusive and sustained growth within a stronger governance
framework. The CPS, a joint strategy of the Bank Group, is aligned with the
government’s outcome-oriented, medium-term framework (MTF), which remains
broadly valid in the current global crisis (See Table 2, Annexes 2 and 6).
II.
A.

COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK

Political Context

8.
Jamaica is a Westminster-style parliamentary democracy. Politics have
historically been dominated by two main parties – the People’s National Party (PNP) and
the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Democratic participation and elections have increasingly
been more free and fair. Jamaicans have long enjoyed a high degree of personal freedom,
freedom of expression, and a vibrant free press.
9.
The general elections held in September 2007 resulted in a change in the
ruling party after 18 years. The governing JLP has 32 seats compared with the
opposition’s 28. The general election victory was predicated, inter alia, on a platform of:
reduction in crime and violence, economic growth, poverty reduction, and strengthening
of the governance framework, particularly in relation to combating corruption. These
goals remain evasive but are high priorities for the government.
B.

Governance and Corruption

10.
The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index declined
steadily in the last decade, signifying worsening perceptions of corruption. In 2008,
Jamaica was ranked 96 out of 180 countries, with only the Dominican Republic, Guyana
and Haiti ranking lower among Caribbean countries. In July 2008, public opinion polls,
for the first time, listed corruption (21%) as the second most serious problem facing the
country behind crime and violence (57%). Improvements in the public financial
management and procurement systems are needed to drastically reduce the scope for
corruption. The procurement policy has improved but scope remains for further
improvement (see Section III below).
11.
The government is committed to tackling corruption. The National Integrity
Action Forum was launched by the Prime Minister in 2008 and meets quarterly. The
government has been able to attract a number of energetic new reformers in key positions
and retain champions of national integrity in key agencies.
C.

Crime and Violence

12.
Jamaica’s homicide rate is among the highest in the world, with adverse
consequences for investment and development. Preliminary data for 2009 estimate
that 6.2 persons out of every 10,000 were murdered. Guns were used in 77 percent of the
homicides. These crimes, many of them linked to armed gangs, are often characterized by
2

male on male, poor on poor, and youth on youth in the impoverished communities. The
cost of interpersonal violence in 2006 was estimated to be about 5 percent of GDP1. A
World Bank study (2007) estimated that if the homicide rate was reduced to the level of
Costa Rica – that is, a quarter of its then level – the country would see a 5.4 percentage
point increase in the annual per capita GDP growth rate2.
13.
High levels of crime are associated with a pattern of politically motivated
violence in the 1970s and 1980s, and the emergence of Jamaica as a significant point
for the trans-shipment of drugs from South America to the US and Europe in the
1990s. This development coincided with further erosion of social capital from high
unemployment and the consequent emigration of many professional and qualified
Jamaicans. A complex relationship evolved between organized crime and inner-city
communities, as major criminal gangs – generally involved in illegal narcotics and
extortion – control many neighborhoods and often provide key services to residents. The
major gangs have weakened in recent years, at least partly due to international initiatives
to curb drug trans-shipment. However, smaller local groups have since been vying to fill
the void and the conflict between them has kept rates of homicides at high levels.
D.

Poverty and Human Development

14.
Poverty remains relatively high in rural areas. The poverty incidence fell from
28.4 percent in 1990 to 9.9 percent in 2007. Poverty declined sharply in the Kingston
metropolitan area, from 13.3 percent to 6.2 percent over the same period. By contrast,
poverty in rural areas declined from 37.5 percent to 15.3 percent. Poverty reduction is
attributable, in part, to: (i) a rise in remittances from increased emigration following the
financial meltdown in 1995-97; (ii) a decline in the relative prices of food in the 19962004 period, which benefited poor households disproportionately; and, (iii) a sharp
reduction in inflation, which also benefitted the poor. Although the effects of the sharp
increases in energy and food prices in mid-20083 and the recent economic crises have not
been fully measured, it is likely that the poor have been adversely impacted. Against this
background, the government in 2008 increased the amount and widened the coverage of
the conditional cash transfer for the poor and the most vulnerable. While addressing the
fiscal and debt sustainability issues, the government plans to expand the conditional cash
transfer program to ease any adverse impact on the poor.
15.
Poverty reduction, however, does not square with other facts. For example,
surveys show that the share of the consumption of the lowest quintile since 1990 remains
at 6-7 percent and that for the wealthiest quintile at 45-46 percent. Data for 2008 show
that 20 percent of the population lived in informal settlements with 60 percent in urban
areas. An estimated 37 percent of the population are squatters and, therefore, without land

country but needs to expand it to ease accessing financing and getting jobs.
16.
Human capital development is of concern as about 35 percent of potential
workers remain outside the labor force and two-thirds of those have never passed a
Grade 9 level test, which is a requirement to attain vocational certification. The
prevalence of the increasingly prominent informal labor market4 and the fact that one out
of two households receives remittances for sustenance, could mean that the reservation
wage is high. A better understanding of the causes is needed to devise appropriate policy
tools to adequately address the human development issues.
17.
In terms of social indicators, Jamaica will achieve most of its Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Life expectancy is comparable to high income countries
(72 years in 2007), enrollment in primary and junior secondary school is near universal,
and access to water and sanitation services has improved considerably with coverage at
93 percent and 80 percent, respectively. Based on national estimates, it is expected that
Jamaica will comfortably meet targets for poverty reduction, infant and child nutrition,
primary education and access to safe drinking water. The country is on track to halt and
reverse the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis and possibly HIV/AIDS; however, it
will not meet targets for infant and maternal mortality5. With respect to education, the
problem is not access but education quality and boys’ under-performance and attendance,
which are in part connected to poverty.

Gender Dimensions and Unemployment

18.
Females out-perform boys in education,
but this is not reflected in most spheres of life.
Female students account for 70 percent of
students at the tertiary level of education and they
begin to out-perform boys at an early age.
However, the labor market is characterized by
disproportionately high unemployment among
youth and females. The unemployment rate for
young females, for example, is more than twice
that of young males (see Table 1). This makes
female youth vulnerable to sexual exploitation
and adolescent pregnancy. Male youth
unemployment is also high and puts them in a
vulnerable position vis-à-vis criminal gangs.

improve efficiency. This included reducing tax
exemptions and the introduction of four
packages of tax measures over the past year.

Debt Stock and Dynamics

20.
Jamaica has the third highest public
debt-to-GDP ratio in the world. Total
domestic and external public debt increased
from 84 percent of GDP in 1997 to a peak of
134.1 percent of GDP in FY99/00, following
the financial crisis of the mid-1990s. Public
debt-to-GDP decreased to 113.5 percent in
FY07/08, before rising again to 124.0 percent
in FY08/09. Reflecting the worsening global
economic crisis and declining domestic
economic activity, the debt ratio is estimated to
have reached 139.7 percent of GDP or
US$6,212 per Jamaican (see Annex B6).

The first two tax measures were introduced as
part of the FY09/10 budget. The government
raised the excise tax on gasoline by J$8.75 per
liter, and broadened the General Consumption
Tax (GCT) base by eliminating exemptions on
several items. The third package was
introduced on October 1, 2009 and included
increasing the GCT rate on telephone services
from 20 percent to 25 percent and increasing
the departure tax from J$1,000 to J$1,800.
The fourth package, introduced on January 1,
2010, included the following measures: (i) The
GCT rate was raised from 16½ percent to 17½
percent. In addition, GCT of 10 percent was
levied on residential electricity consumption
above 200 kwh and commercial/industrial
electricity consumption; the rate of GCT
applicable to the tourism sector has been
increased from 8.25 percent to 10 percent; and
commercial importers are now required to pay
a 5 percent advanced GCT payment on all
taxable imported goods; (ii) tax rates for
income over J$5 million but below J$10
million and for income over J$10 million have
been adjusted from 25 percent to 27.5 percent
and 35 percent, respectively, until March 31,
2011; and, (iii) an ad valorem fuel tax of 15
percent was applied. These measures are
expected to generate revenue equivalent to 2
percent of GDP on a full-year basis.

21.
The government has embarked on an
ambitious reform program to reduce debt
and achieve fiscal sustainability. The reform
program is centered on containing and reducing
debt, enhancing government revenues, and
increasing the efficiency of public sector
spending and investment. In support of this
program, the government has sought
unprecedented level of resources, exceeding 20
percent of GDP, from its international
development partners (IDPs) in order to restore
macroeconomic stability, provide liquidity back-stopping, and ensure resources are
available to support the longer run fiscal and institutional reform program.
22.
Towards reducing the fiscal gap and the debt ratio, the authorities
introduced new tax measures (see Box 1), and announced a debt exchange offer on
January 14, 2010 with the objective of reducing the interest rate on, and extending
the maturity profile of a portion of outstanding domestic debt. The government
estimates that fiscal savings from the debt exchange will be 3 percent of GDP during
FY10/11. The offer does not envisage any cut in principal. Impacts on the domestic
financial sector are estimated to be small. Following the announcement of the debt
exchange, Jamaica’s credit ratings were downgraded by rating agencies. However, the
5

same rating agencies also highlighted that upon successful completion of the debt
exchange, Jamaica’s ratings would be upgraded as the debt exchange would reduce the
debt service burden and improve the prospects for sustainability. Nonetheless, the
downgrading presents short-term challenges and the debt exchange itself may reduce the
liquidity in domestic markets — making it harder for the government to secure financing
in the short term.
23.
Among structural measures, the
government is formulating a Fiscal
Responsibility Framework to control debt
accumulated by public bodies — their debt
is about 19 percent of GDP (see Box 2).
Despite high primary surpluses of the central
government in past years, debt levels hardly
fell, partially because of contingent liabilities
of some public bodies6. Notwithstanding the
risk of having to service the public bodies’
non-guaranteed debt, owed mostly to the
domestic private sector, the government’s
current debt management strategy focuses on
direct and central government guaranteed debt
only. With the expected consolidation of
public bodies into the central budget under a
reform program, the non-guaranteed debt
portfolio will be integrated into the
government’s Debt Management Unit’s
mandate.
G.

Economic Development and Outlook

24.
Past favorable conditions, creative
entrepreneurship in the tourism sector, and
a relatively trainer-friendly workforce have
enabled dynamic expansion in the tourism,
financial services, telecommunications, and
entertainment and distribution sectors. The
economy is now heavily dominated by services
(70% of GDP in 2008), of which tourism
accounts for 6.9 percent. Other sectors are:
manufacturing (9%); construction (8%);
agriculture (6%); and, mining (bauxite, 2% –
down from 4% due to the global economic
crisis). Despite increased competition for the
two main export crops of sugar and bananas,
6

Box 2: Government Reform Program
The government has embarked on an
ambitious reform program for reducing debt
and achieving fiscal sustainability. At the
core of this reform is the new Fiscal
Responsibility Framework (FRF) which will be
implemented over the course of the next two
years. It specifies responsibilities, processes,
and targets for achieving the government’s
objective of improved fiscal sustainability,
including the specific target of bringing public
debt to below 100 percent of GDP by 2015/16.
This reform program is supported by the Bank
through a proposed programmatic series of
DPLs.
Fiscal sustainability requires containing and
reducing debt, enhancing government
revenues, and increasing the efficiency of
public sector spending and investment. The
government’s program in this context consists
of three policy priorities within the structure
provided by the Fiscal Responsibility
Framework and the strategic plan to rationalize
public bodies: (i) contain government
expenditures through greater control of public
sector balances and debt; (ii) address
constraints in the efficiency of the central
government financial management and budget
processes; and (iii) improve tax policy and tax
administration to reduce tax distortions and
enhance equity. See Annex 4 for details.
Key reforms supported by the Bank and other
development partners are through analysis,
budgetary support and technical assistance to
consolidating the budget of the central
government and public bodies; rationalizing the
functions of public bodies and divesting loss
making commercial entities; containing the
growth of the public sector wage bill;
enhancing the monitoring, evaluation and
performance of public spending; procurement
and improving accounting and financial
reporting; and improving the prioritization of
public sector investments.

Public bodies’ fiscal accounts are not consolidated with the central government’s accounts; therefore, debt
assumed by the central government is referred to as other debt accumulating flows.

agriculture remains an important source of livelihood for the rural population, albeit
shrinking.
25.
Macroeconomic resilience to adverse natural events remains weak. Jamaica’s
emergency response to disaster events has improved but the fiscal vulnerability to
adverse natural events remains high. The country would not be able to generate enough
internal and external financing to replace infrastructure and goods if struck by a category
4 or 5 hurricane.

past decade. The number of
tourist arrivals increased by 3.4 percent on an annual basis, while many other Caribbean
countries experienced significant declines.7 Nevertheless, tourism receipts are down and
a number of large hotels have been closed. The bauxite industry has collapsed, with three
of the four alumina factories closed. By end-2009, a total of 40,000 persons, or 4 percent
of the 2007 employment level, had been laid off in the formal sector. Inflation pressures
are easing, and the annual inflation went down from a peak of 26.5 percent in August
2008 to 10.2 percent in December 2009. The Jamaican dollar depreciated against the US
dollar by 23 percent in the eleven months to August 2009, and by 10.2 percent for
calendar year 2009. The full impact of the crisis has not been documented yet, but its
social implications look worrisome based on reported increase in property crimes. In
this context, the economy contracted by 1.2 percent in calendar year 2008 and is
estimated to have declined by a further 3.8 percent in 2009 (see Figure 1).

27.
A gradual recovery from the current crisis (see Annex B6) and the
government's program (see Box 2) to put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a clear
downward path would require a significant multilateral financing package in
support of a debt reduction policy framework. The government has been
implementing a major tax reform which includes tax measures and institutional changes
to increase the tax base, enforce compliance, increase efficiency and effectiveness of the

Tax Administration and Customs Department, and thereby boost government fiscal
revenues. Improvements in debt management and implementation of business reforms
would also contribute to achieving government objectives of fiscal and debt
sustainability.
28.
The economic outlook for the medium-term is of gradual recovery depending
on global market conditions and the continued commitment to macroeconomic
stabilization and fiscal reforms. Under these circumstances, foreign exchange reserves
are expected to remain steady due to declines in imports, US$330 million SDR grant
allocation and an IMF Standby Arrangement for US$1.25 billion approved on February
4, 2010. A multilateral financing package equivalent to 20 percent of GDP is needed to
reduce interest costs and refinancing risk, which will provide time for government to
implement necessary reforms to bring the debt ratio into a downward path. The IMF
program addresses the fiscal imbalance and protection of the social gains by increasing
and expanding coverage of the country’s flagship conditional cash transfer program.
H.

Finance Sector Issues

29.
The financial sector is relatively stable and well-capitalized, albeit not free of
systemic risk. As of June 2009, the solvency indicator was adequate as reflected by the
capital asset ratio of the banking system, which was 15.4 percent, similar to that observed
in June 2008 (15.6 percent), and higher than that observed in December 2008 (13.9
percent). In the twelve months to June 2009, the rate of credit growth was 20 percent,
which was funded partially by deposits, borrowings (including repos), and a shift in bank
portfolios away from investments. The return on assets remained largely unchanged over
the same period. However, there are signs that the Jamaican financial sector has suffered
from the effects of the international financial crisis. The non-performing loan ratio (NPLs
over total loans) for commercial banks has increased from 2.2 percent in June 2008 to 3.6
percent in June 2009. Over the same period, the ratio of provisions for loan losses over
NPLs declined from 120 percent in June 2008 to 91 percent. Credit to the private sector is
expected to increase from J$33 billion to J$49 billion between FY08/09 and FY09/10. In
addition, the central bank has provided an emergency credit line to financial firms that
were suffering dollar liquidity constraints due to a drop in the value of collateral, from
which US$168 million was drawn. The government has also accessed the IDB’s Growth
Stability Fund for US$200 million for on-lending to commercial financial institutions to
support credit to firms that suffer financial constraints from the loss of suppliers’ credits.
30.
In past years, burgeoning pyramid schemes constituted a threat to financial
sector stability, but the collapse of some of these schemes has substantially
decreased their attractiveness to the public. Perhaps the most relevant systemic risk
today is the high dependency of the domestic financial system on government debt,
which accounts for almost 80 percent of their liquid assets. Careful monitoring is required
because of the financial sector sensitivity to government performance and vice versa.
Furthermore, risks related to conglomerates could lead to real sector contagion, and
hidden risks could jeopardize the stability of the financial system. In other words, while
banks may appear solid, their real sector operations may not be. This issue suggests the
need to intensify oversight of the financial sector for related party transactions of
conglomerates and non-bank financial institutions.
8

I.

Telecommunication Sector Issues

31.
The telecommunications sector growth momentum is limited by relatively
low broadband access in the country. Inclusion of new mobile operators in 2000 has
increased mobile penetration from 14.2 per 100 persons in December 2000 to 101.3 in
2008, in part, reflecting the prevalence of more than one cell phone per person because of
high intra-network connection charges. However, broadband penetration remains low at
3.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants. Some potential causes of this relatively low
penetration could include: (i) high international connectivity prices due to lack of
capacity and competition; (ii) unavailability of nationwide backbone networks; and (iii)
artificial barriers through inefficient regulation.
J.

Environment and Disaster Management

32.
Jamaica is vulnerable to climate change and its environment has suffered
from years of resource constraints. The country continues to make progress in
integrating sustainable development principles in policies and programs, raising public
awareness of these principles, and working to address environmental threats. However,
overall weak coordination, a lack of clarity in key institutional roles and responsibilities,
and poor enforcement of legislation and regulation are slowing progress in the
implementation of environmental policies. Private ownership of large parts of the country
constrains biodiversity management; inadequate funding; and lack of political
commitment and limited human resource capacity impede forest management. Solid
waste management issues are emerging in cities like Kingston and in urban towns. Issues
relating to disaster risks and potential climate change impacts require further scrutiny.
33.
Potential exists to build on, and extend, the Use of Country Systems for
environmental and social safeguards. The Bank is piloting the Use of Country Systems
with the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF), which adopted policies equivalent to the
Bank’s environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards. The diagnostic work and
institutional strengthening measures undertaken with JSIF were pivotal in JSIF becoming
the only public entity in the region to receive an ISO 14001 certification for
environmental management systems in January 2009. The Bank can capitalize on the
positive experience to scale up this initiative to other agencies. The government has
expressed interest in getting support to strengthen institutional capacity to coordinate and
oversee environmental management processes.
34.
The cost of natural disasters is high and disaster management is becoming a
priority for the government. Hurricanes thus far have been costly and the damages
they cause are sometimes permanent, usually resulting from coastal storm surge and flash
floods. Seismic risk is also particularly significant in the Kingston metropolitan area,
which was previously devastated by an earthquake in 1907. The Kingston metropolitan
area now holds a large concentration of critical infrastructure, including the harbor and
airport, built on reclaimed land prone to liquefaction. Recent studies have shown the need
to revise seismic hazard maps and building policies -- new building codes were recently
completed.

III.

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND GOVERNMENT VISION

35.
The three critical development challenges for the government are to: (i)
mitigate the medium-term effects of the global economic crisis; (ii) protect social
gains while moving towards fiscal and debt sustainability; and, (iii) lay a foundation
for inclusive and sustained growth over the medium term. To these ends, the
government has articulated an ambitious long-term strategy, Vision 2030, and an
associated Medium-Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework (MTF, FY09-12) with
intermediate steps that will support the longer term vision. The economic environment is
fundamentally different from when the process began four years ago, but the broad
thrusts of the articulated strategy remain valid. Vision 2030 aims at shifting the economy
from one based exclusively on exploiting “basic factors” – sun and sand tourism, mineral
deposits and basic agricultural commodities – to one that is increasingly based on higher
forms of capital including cultural, human, knowledge and institutional to take the
country to OECD standards of living. The medium-term strategy identifies six national
outcomes, five supporting national outcomes,8 and one hundred and fifty-two goals. The
national outcomes and goals are linked to the proposed CPS sub-pillars, and current
identified sources of support by the IDPs are highlighted in Table 2.
A.

Achieving Economic Stability

36.
Improving fiscal and debt sustainability in order to reduce debt overhang and
reverse the weak growth trajectory is high priority in Jamaica, and addressing
governance and corruption issues are integral to achieving this objective. For
example, 3 percent of income tax payers account for over 80 percent of income tax
revenues while significant revenue is lost at important public institutions. Overall, the
public institutions are relatively strong, but the perception of corruption is increasing.
Improvements in the public financial management and procurement systems not
only improve the efficiency of public spending but also drastically reduce the scope
for corruption. According to the 2006 CFAA/CPAR, the principal weaknesses in public
financial management include: (i) lack of forward looking budget and prioritization of
expenditures; (ii) lack of hard budget constraints for public bodies; (iii) significant
divergence between the original approved budget estimates and what is actually
implemented; (iv) delays in reporting of the accounting, auditing and publication of
results; and, (v) while accounting, recording and reporting standards exist, these are not
in line with international standards. The government is aware of these limitations and is
carrying out activities with technical assistance to address some of them. Additional
assistance is required, however.

8

The supporting national outcomes the government wishes to achieve are: (i) an enabling business
environment; (ii) internationally competitive industry structures; (iii) hazard risk reduction and adaptation
to climate change; (iv) effective social protection; and, (v) authentic and transformational culture.

Public procurement policy has improved but scope remains for further
improvement. The 2006 CFAA/CPAR noted that significant improvement is needed for
increased transparency, particularly on procurement performance and monitoring.9 A
large number of public bodies are involved in the approval process, causing expensive
contracts in the process and a longer period to complete a project. The CPAR
recommendations, still valid, are: (i) enhancing public procurement performance and
monitoring; (ii) improving supplier registration; (iii) developing reliable and consistent
statistics on procurement; and, (iv) intensifying efforts to create a cadre of qualified
procurement officers. Any reforms must be accompanied by capacity building on broader
procurement issues and contract management, particularly in the implementing agencies.
38.
National outcome I on a stable macro-economy is critical in Jamaica’s longerterm development and a central objective is to begin to turn around some of the main
macro issues that have plagued the country since the 1970s. To protect macroeconomic
stability and confidence in markets, the government is implementing a 27-month IMF
Standby Arrangement, which includes provision to expand social spending. Ongoing
Bank operations such as the social protection, inner cities basic services and the
emergency recovery projects will help to protect social gains and provide much needed
employment. Other donors, such as the CDB, IDB and EU are also providing budget and
additional programs to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and protect social gains.
39.
In addition, the government is moving towards bringing Parliamentary
oversight over the consolidated public sector account and working towards adopting a
fiscal responsibility framework. Also, IDB, USAID, US Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service have provided technical assistance on revenue collections and
management while the Bank has provided non-lending technical assistance on
strengthening debt management.
B.

Promoting Inclusive Growth

40.
Strengthening human capital would address the issue of relatively low level of
education and skill gaps, a major impediment to growth. The 2008 Labour Force
Survey confirms that 68 percent of the work force has passed no examination10 and 72
percent received no training. In addition, the social capital is weak, which reflects the
family structure and the low trust environment in the Jamaican society. Personal
depression level is also high – for example, 26 percent of women and 15 percent of men
suffer from depression,11 which may contribute to lower productivity. These longstanding
social deficits contributed to the decline in labor productivity over the period 19732007.12
9

In early 2008, the Bank was advised during the Results Based CPPR discussion that such a system is
being put in place for JSIF projects.
10
The introduction of the Caribbean Certificate of Secondary Level Competency allows students to leave
secondary schools with a certificate that demonstrates learning of minimum skills and information. In the
2008 CXC examinations only 16.7% of boys and 30.1% of girls passed five subjects or more, including
English language and math, an indication of low levels of basic skills when students leave secondary
school.

41.
The challenge the government faces is to prioritize between pre- and tertiary
level education for funding with its limited resources, and it has chosen the former.
The government is funding early childhood development, where the country is a pioneer
in the region, and is embarking on a complete overhaul of the pre-tertiary system. The
objective is to move away from centralized decision making, without sufficient attention
to quality, to one of increased accountability throughout the system, by devolving
decision-making authority to the regional level, increasing the capacity of the teachers
and administrators, and providing more targeted support to schools. Bipartisan support
exists for this strategic focus as the current, two-shift education system needs to be
urgently replaced by one where children learn and develop social skills. The Ministry of
Education is launching a National Parenting Commission to assist parents to be more
actively involved in the education of their children.
42.
The shift in education priority implies that tertiary institutions need to find
creative ways to educate the future workforce in a competitive environment. While
primary and secondary education is free in Jamaica and early childhood mostly paid for
privately, tertiary education has been subsidized. A government student loan facility is
available for tertiary education. Given the fiscal pressure, the government is redirecting
its resources to pre-tertiary education. Under these circumstances, public-private
partnership is critical to design and implement policies and programs to strengthen skills
for school leavers and for those already in the labor market. The Bank, CDB, IDB, IFC,
UNICEF and USAID are supporting these education transformations, with IFC focusing
on public-private partnership potential.
43.
Jamaica has a good network of primary health care facilities but faces
increased challenge in terms of human and financial resources. The primary health
care infrastructure reaches deep into rural areas; however, resource constraints and
shortages of local medical professionals, due to emigration, are straining the health care
system’s ability to provide timely and quality care. Shortages in the country are filled by
Asian medical professionals as the domestic training system is not geared to train
increased numbers of medical professionals. The abolishment of user fees at public
health facilities in 2008, in keeping with an election pledge, has significantly increased
demand for health services and the government is facing fiscal challenges to sustain this
service.
44.
Jamaica’s incidence of HIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases is
relatively high. HIV/AIDS remains a major threat in Jamaica, with an unchanged
prevalence rate of 1.6 percent among the 15-49 age group. Early initiation of sexual
activity and high multiple partners contribute to this prevalence even though condom use
in the same age group is quite high at 66.3 percent for women and 83.5 percent for men.
At the same time, non-communicable diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, diabetes and
hypertension contribute to over 60 percent of the burden of disease. Only 19 percent of
Jamaicans between 15 and 74 years old have private health insurance. The Bank,
UNAIDS and the Global Fund are all supporting the government on HIV/AIDS.
Additionally, the Bank is analyzing non-communicable diseases that could lead to future
support for the health sector.
45.
To address human capital issues, the government has identified national
outcome II: World class education and training. This outcome aims to expand and
13

improve the quality of education by way of the Education Transformation Program (ETP)
and the Early Childhood Development Project. These programs aim to improve the
quality and relevance of the country’s education system. Re-training, skill development
and certifying the labor force is a key success factor for economic stability and growth.
The early childhood development program is support by CDB, OAS, UNICEF and the
World Bank. The wide-ranging education reform is being initiated with support from the
IDB, USAID, UNICEF and the World Bank.
46.
Crime and violence prevention is one of the most fundamental development
challenges that faces Jamaica today and the government is vigorously seeking effective
ways to reduce crime and strengthen the rule of law. The high incidence of crime and
violence is a reflection of social fragmentation, and it has hindered economic and civic
activities in inner city communities. The occupational profile of persons arrested for
major crimes confirm disproportionate representation of elementary occupations – i.e.,
the least skilled, least educated and, therefore, the most vulnerable section of the labor
force. This situation reinforces the need for quality education and crime and violence
prevention measures.
47.
The national outcome III on greater security and safety aims to restore a sense
of safety and cohesion to Jamaican society through a significant reduction in the crime,
violence and civil disturbances, which have led to social fragmentation, increased poverty
and reduced economic activities especially in the inner cities. A number of projects and
programs are supported in these areas by DFID, EU, IDB, UNDP, USAID and the World
Bank. Resources needed are significant and there is a need for an integrated approach.
48.
The national outcome IV on effective governance aims to strengthen public
sector effectiveness overall, but also includes a special focus on strengthening the justice
system. The government recognizes that a key component in achieving more effective
governance is a reduction in the incidence and perception of corruption. To this end, a
national integrity action forum has been established with bipartisan and civil society
support and the government is implementing wide-ranging reform of the justice system
with support from CIDA, EU, IDB, and UNDP. To make any significant progress on
governance it is important to disrupt the relationship between organized crime on the one
hand and inner-city communities, the police, the political and public procurement system
on the other. It would also be important to raise the levels of social trust to enhance the
stock of social capital and secure effective social partnership.13 Sectoral strategies need
to be developed and are expected with support from IDPs including the World Bank.
49.
Promoting rural development is high priority for the government as the
agriculture sector is not contributing its potential and urban crime is increasingly
moving to rural areas. Agriculture has historically been centered on large scale sugar
and banana exports under European trade preferences, which have now ceased.
Alternatives are needed to resuscitate rural economy and incomes, to prevent further
movement of people to the over-crowded urban areas. Small scale agriculture does
13

Jamaica ranks among the lowest trusting societies globally: 83 percent of Jamaicans in a recent survey
disagree that most people in society are trustworthy (Political Culture of Democracy in Jamaica,
University of the West Indies Press, 2008) compared with an average of 52 percent in a Pew survey of 47
countries around the world.

14

exhibit significant potential for growth, particularly in the domestic market where it could
displace high cost imports. Additionally, a shift in agriculture would also facilitate
alternative crop substitution to more effectively displace marijuana cultivation, which has
been long prevalent in some rural parishes. The agriculture sector will, however, need to
be strengthened through technology transfer and infrastructure improvements to become
competitive.
50.
Key challenges that need to be addressed for further agricultural growth and
development are: (i) improving productivity by replacing inefficient production
practices and outdated technology; (ii) improving market infrastructure to lower postharvest and logistical costs; (iii) addressing the problem of praedial larceny;14 (iv)
improving the public and private financial management of weather-related agriculture
risks; (v) improving the targeting and efficiency of public expenditures in the agriculture
sector to promote competitiveness; and (vi) diversification of agriculture and rural
economy that would include: (a) promotion of climate resilient agriculture such as
hurricane-resistant crops, salt and drought tolerant crops, and (b) promotion and capture
of the value-added agro-processing opportunities. These challenges will be addressed
mainly through the ongoing rural economic development project and the technical
assistance work on agricultural risk management. Praedial larceny will be considered
through the proposed crime and violence project.
51.
The supporting national outcome I focuses on internationally competitive
industry structures including development of the agriculture sector. The goals include
promotion of national food security and strengthening of efforts to reduce praedial
larceny.
C.

Promoting Sustained Growth

52.
Strengthening non-labor competitiveness would be important to achieve
sustained growth. In the financial sector, there exists: (i) inadequate regulations to
monitor the strength and performance of the large regional financial institutions that
dominate Jamaica and the Caribbean including possible contagion from other
jurisdictions and via related parties; (ii) inadequate private sector participation in micro-,
small- and mid-sized enterprise (MSME) lending, partly because of insufficient product
knowledge, but also because the government’s debt and monetary policy may undermine
commercial bank lending; (iii) the continued absence of a Jamaican or Caribbean credit
bureau to help improve access to credit; and, (iv) the absence of unsecured risk taking
instruments (equity and quasi-equity) to support the needs of the SME sector. The
government has made progress toward preparing credit bureau legislation, with support
from the IFC and IDB. Some of the broader financial sector regulations, stemming from
the 2005 FSAP report, are the subject of an IMF Financial Sector Program.
53.
The high cost of electricity is a significant impediment to Jamaica’s
competitiveness. At 34 US cents per kWh in Jamaica (compared to 3 cents in Trinidad
and Tobago, its main competitor in the region for light manufacturing), the cost of energy
adversely affects the welfare of the population and the country’s competitiveness. High
14

Praedial larceny is theft of agricultural produce and livestock; estimated to cost about US$60 million
annually.

15

energy costs are due to a combination of the choice of imported fuel, inefficient
generation and distribution infrastructure, electricity theft, and weakness in sector
regulation that does not provide incentive for the operator to minimize costs. Tourism and
hotels (45%) and the bauxite and alumina (40%) account for the bulk of the electricity
demand. It is estimated that Jamaica will need to commission 200-300MW of additional
generation capacity in the next 3-5 years to meet demand and also to replace costly
generating installations, on the assumption that the bauxite industry will recover. The
government has recently decided to promote LNG as the choice for future energy
generation and has sought Bank and IFC support in energy risk management, reducing
the cost of electricity and increasing overall supply under economic terms. The IDB will
also support energy conservation.
54.
Jamaica’s competitiveness is impacted by low broadband penetration in the
telecommunication sector. The two submarine cables that currently serve Jamaica are
reaching their maximum capacity. Proposed projects to expand or install new submarine
cables are at a strong risk of being delayed or cancelled with their long-term economic
viability threatened. Yet, broadband access is important to leverage opportunities for
trade and competitiveness, economic diversification and social development.
55.
The high cost associated with the administration of tax is also a major
constraint to doing business in Jamaica. The government is implementing a tax
administration reform, which would, for example, reduce the need to retain a full-time
staff one day a week for a full year to make various tax payments. The IMF, IDB and
USAID are in support of the simplification of the tax payment procedures, which should
improve the business climate. The Bank also provided a reform memorandum and will
support this initiative with technical assistance as needed.
56.
National outcome V on strong economic infrastructure aims to foster the
development of an integrative role for transport, telecommunications and water
infrastructure in economic development. This outcome is being supported by Belgium,
CDB, EU, IDB, Japan, USAID, Venezuela and World Bank. Despite the heavy
concentration of IDPs, several important areas remain unsupported. For example, the
strategy for expanding domestic and international air transport infrastructure and services
is being supported by CDB but only for financing the Norman Manley Airport terminal;
CDB’s financing of the Palisades approach road to the airport is being replaced by
resources from China. This situation reinforces the difficulty with which the government
will have to achieve its medium-term objectives with its limited fiscal resources and the
need to explore Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in a broad range of sectors.
57.
National outcome VI on energy security and efficiency aims to foster energy
diversification, and promote energy efficiency and conservation with support from IDB,
IFC, PetroCaribe, and the World Bank. The IFC and the Bank are exploring PPP options
in energy. Facilitating growth with equity, particularly in uplifting and empowering the
lowest quintiles through strengthened MSMEs, is essential to the national goal of a safe,
cohesive, and just society.
58.
Climate change and vulnerability are major challenges for Jamaica. Climate
variability will exacerbate existing disaster risk, especially in coastal areas some of
which are among the most vulnerable and are characterized by high levels of poverty,
16

environmental degradation and indiscriminate land use practices. Higher sea levels will
compound the storm surge risk, which may also rise with the potential for stronger or
more frequent storms. Sea-level rise will also be associated with saline intrusion into
coastal aquifers, affecting the availability of freshwater and increasing water stress. Coral
bleaching will also impact ecosystems, and livelihoods from tourism and fisheries. The
latest Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections indicates a
reduction in precipitation in Jamaica throughout the year, with the largest reductions
occurring in the summer. The expected reductions in precipitation along with an increase
in the intensity of rains will affect slope stability, landslide and flood risks, and cause
water availability, storage and delivery problems.
59.
Systematic weather risks, especially hurricanes and associated wind damages
set back the income and capitalization gains achieved by farmers, making it harder
for farmers to sustain income growth in the medium- to long-term, losing
competitiveness and affecting households’ consumption, as well as, widespread
destruction of rural infrastructure. However, the challenge of the financial management
and transfer of weather risks in the agriculture sector is compounded by the prevalence of
micro-climates in areas, such as the Blue Mountains.
60.
Vulnerability of public infrastructure and housing to hurricanes and
earthquakes is growing. The economic losses associated with earthquakes and
hurricanes in Jamaica are well documented and show a rising trend, primarily due to an
increase in vulnerable structures because of physical deficiency and their location. In
addition, a high percentage of the population and much critical infrastructure are located along
the coast implying that crucial economic assets are highly exposed to tropical storms and

hurricanes. Hurricane Dean is estimated to have resulted in losses of more than US$300
million in 2007, including damages to more than 500 schools and public educational
institutions. Similar strength hurricanes will on average make landfall in Jamaica once
every decade. Jamaica can reduce the economic impact and social disruption of future
hurricanes and earthquakes by: (i) investing in the reduction of existing vulnerability of
its public infrastructure; and, (ii) ensuring stricter enforcement of its physical planning
laws and regulations, including identification of “No Build Zones,” in order to minimize
life and property damage from both inland and coastal flooding and flood events. The
Bank is supporting development of a regional risk atlas for hazard risk management, a
pilot program for risk reduction and, with IDB, a Pilot Program for Climate Resilience.
61.
Sustained growth also requires addressing the underperformance of boys in
school and their engagement in risky behaviors at early age. The Bank’s program
addresses the issue of youth at risk with an emphasis on boys through the following
actions: (i) knowledge exchange and identifying best practices as part of a Caribbean
regional initiative to keep boys out of risk; (ii) engaging with policy makers in Jamaica
including representatives from the Youth Ministry, Education Ministry, and academia, to
follow up on dissemination of best practices. These are also specific follow up actions for
Jamaica agreed upon at a regional workshop in 2009 in a Common Platform for Action to
keep Boys out of Risk. The Bank team is working in partnership with other donors and
the Commonwealth Secretariat to organize conferences and events; (iii) including a youth
at risk perspective and a special focus on boys in World Bank education projects, school
to work transition, and skills development projects or technical assistance.
17

D.

Strengthening Governance

62.
Despite a national integrity forum, there is no well-articulated national or
agency-specific strategy in Jamaica. There is need to: (i) strengthen the legislative
framework (e.g., the whistle-blower and conflict of interest rules in public bodies’
legislation); (ii) establish public trust in the justice and the police systems; and, (iii)
ensure timelier, successful detection, investigation, prosecution and punishment for
corruption practices. An IDF grant has been earmarked to assist the government in
developing a bipartisan governance and anti-corruption strategy for selected public
institutions.

JAMAICA-WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP

The Program under CAS, FY05-09

63.
The FY05-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) program was designed
around three Pillars and two cross-cutting themes (see Annex 5). These were: (i)
Pillar I: Accelerating Inclusive Economic Growth supported achievement of
macroeconomic stability, and reduction of poverty and increased social inclusion for the
poor; (ii) Pillar II: Improving Human Development and Opportunity supported improved
access to and quality of education, and HIV/AIDS prevention and care; and (iii) Pillar III:
Crime Prevention and Reduction supported an effective community crime prevention
system. The Governance theme included enhanced public sector efficiency, expansion of
participatory framework and improved accountability and transparency. The
environmental sustainability theme supported enhancing government’s capacity to
respond to natural catastrophes and mainstreaming environmental consideration in
investment planning.
64.
During this period, the World Bank approved five investment loans and one DPL
for a total of US$204.3 million. Jamaica also benefited from four national and seven
regional AAAs, as well as, a number of trust fund grants. IFC actively engaged in
transactions in the financial sector (including SME financing) and infrastructure (energy
and airport) with six projects for a total financing of US$192 million, including US$70
million from participating banks. MIGA also approved two guarantee insurance cover.
B.

Summary Findings of the CAS Completion Report

65.
The Bank’s program in CAS FY05-09 was aligned with the government’s
MTF, FY04-09, and it sought to contribute to eight strategic objectives based on the
MTF. The CAS Progress Report of July 2007 presented a Results Matrix with 12
outcomes. These outcomes were intended to be achieved through 10 lending operations
and 12 studies, of which 6 had a country-focus and 6 had a regional scope. Later, in
response to government requests, the Bank: (i) approved the Hurricane Dean Emergency
Recovery Program (ERP), a follow-on HIV/AIDS project, and several Trust Funds; (ii)
produced an electricity policy note; and, (iii) undertook studies for parametric risk
insurance for coffee and agriculture in general. The country also benefited from the
ongoing regional work on risk atlas for hazard risk management.

18

66.
The CAS Completion Report concludes that the performance over the CAS
period was mixed at best when judged against the goals outlined in MTF, FY04-09.
While some modest gains were made in streamlining and better targeting Jamaica’s social
programs, there was virtually no progress toward the objective of achieving
macroeconomic stability. Of particular concern in that regard are the adverse trends in
indicators concerning national debt, fiscal balances, growth and inflation. The outcomes
are described fully in the CAS Completion Report (Annex 5).
67.
Portfolio assessments, in terms of outcomes, delivery targets, budget
performance and disbursements are considered fully satisfactory. Without exception,
both government officials and other stakeholders were appreciative of the recent
strengthening of the Bank office in Jamaica and felt that it had greatly helped in
improving the country dialogue as well as interaction among external partners.
68.
The performance under FY05-09 CAS suggests six lessons for the future: (i)
realistic outcomes target setting in the partnership strategy, paying due attention to the
financial and institutional constraints as well as to Jamaica’s high vulnerability to natural
hazards; (ii) projects dimensioned bearing in mind Jamaica’s fiscal constraints; a
successful project can always be scaled up as a repeater project or through additional
financing; (iii) revisit sectoral priorities to ensure that focus on social sectors is
complemented by due attention to growth issues together with issues of governance and
corruption; (iv) strengthen supervision of fiduciary aspects especially procurement, if
possible, through further decentralization through a mini-hub with the Caribbean
countries; (v) ensure adequate dissemination and outreach for analytical and advisory
work; and, (vi) further strengthen aid coordination, especially vis-à-vis IDB and EU, and
explore the possibility of a joint CAS by the key partners.

“Moderately Satisfactory” ratings for both Procurement and Financial Management.
These ratings reflect increased in-country trainings provided and networking among
implementing agencies facilitated since upgrading of the Bank office in 2008.
71.
Jamaica is currently IFC’s second largest country exposure in the EnglishSpeaking Caribbean, closely behind Trinidad and Tobago. At the end of December
2009, IFC's disbursed and held portfolios totaled US$109 million and US$137 million,
respectively. Syndicated loans (B loans), for which IFC is lender of record, amounted to
US$72 million also at the end of December 2009. In FY08, IFC committed US$17.5
million new financing into First Jamaica’s residential and commercial real estate
development projects. In FY09, IFC signed US$25 million in new commitments in
Jamaica.
72.
Demand for IFC’s support has been particularly strong in infrastructure and
the financial sector. In infrastructure, IFC committed US$46 million in investment
(including US$20 million from syndicating banks) for the three-phase upgrade and
expansion of the Sangster Airport in Montego Bay, the first privatized airport in the
English-Speaking Caribbean. The project is expected to help increase the airport’s
capacity to nine million passengers per year, sufficient to accommodate Jamaica’s
expected growth in tourism traffic for the foreseeable future. Additionally, IFC
committed US$123 million (of which US$50 million is from syndicating banks) in two
projects to support the expansion and restructuring of independent power production and
distribution. This represents a total financing of US$169 million in FY03-FY09.15
73.
IFC committed US$30 million to National Commercial Bank of Jamaica (NCBJ),
a leading local bank, to support its diversification of funding sources and strengthen its
balance sheet. In addition, US$20 million – a preferred share subscription of $10 million
and a US$10 million loan – was committed to First Global Bank. With IFC’s financial
and advisory support, the bank will augment the level of credit made available to
MSMEs, enhancing the still modest 21 percent of Jamaica’s banking penetration. First
Global expects to generate 240 SME loans for a total of US$55.5 million.
74.
IFC’s advisory portfolio focuses on the Air Jamaica Privatization Project as well
as increasing the access to finance. IFC is mandated by the government to design and
implement the privatization strategy for the national airline, Air Jamaica. The
privatization of the airline is one of the government’s key objectives. Air Jamaica plays a
significant role in Jamaica's aviation sector with over 45 percent market share (1.7
million annual passengers). However, the company represents a significant burden on the
government's fiscal account (on average, US$15 million per month). As part of its
regional credit bureau program, IFC advised government on a proposed credit bureau
legislation. When enacted, this legislation should facilitate the availability of credit to
currently underserved segments of society. IFC recently signed an advisory agreement
with one of Jamaica’s largest microfinance institutions to provide diagnostics and
strategic advice to increase its reach.

15

While committed in Trinidad & Tobago, the IFC’s US$37 million to the cement company TCL was used
to upgrade and double the clinker capacity of its Jamaican plant.

20

75.
MIGA has provided cumulative guarantees of US$275 million in Jamaica
since 1992. The portfolio fell from US$169 million at end-FY07 to a total guarantee
exposure of US$72 million at end-2008 as a result of guarantees expiring as debt were
amortized for underwritten power projects. The outstanding projects are guarantees for
the financing for the expansion of two stages of Kingston Port Container Terminal.
D.

International Development Partners

76.
A total of seventeen IDPs16 are active in twelve sectors with most support
directed to the social sector (39%), followed by budgetary support (30%) with
strong support for growth and competitiveness. In 2008, ongoing development
partner support amounted to US$2.1 billion, of which 18.6 percent was grant. As of end2008, the largest development partner was IDB with US$673 million, followed by
Venezuela17 with US$410 million, CDB with US$314 million, the EU with US$257
million and the World Bank with US$120 million. In addition, Japan provided significant
amount of PHRD and JSDF grants through the World Bank.
77.
Two bilateral IDPs (CIDA and DFID) have regional strategies while USAID,
IDB and the World Bank have country strategies. All strategies and sectoral support
are provided in line with government priorities articulated through the PIOJ and in the
MTF.
78.
The depth of coordination among IDPs has increased, particularly since the
2008 upgrading and strengthening of the Bank country office. The Bank participates in
the annual retreat with the government and development partners, and it chairs the
thematic group on Debt and Growth. The IFC co-located with the World Bank in August
2009. In doing so, the World Bank Group will strengthen coordination and increase
access to its advisory services, public-private partnerships work, and foster deeper private
sector development.
E.

CPS Consultations

79.
World Bank Group held extensive stakeholder consultations in July 2009
with key stakeholders. A total of 116 people were consulted including thirty-one
members of Parliament in a joint session. The other stakeholders were representatives of:
government (29), private sector (17), civil society (13), trade unions (12), youth (8), and
other international development partners (6).
80.
Stakeholders identified six top priority areas for support: (i) debt and fiscal
sustainability to achieve economic stability and the fiscal space needed to undertake
critical public sector investment in support of higher level of development; (ii) crime and
violence, which deter productive investment and growth; (iii) environment and disaster
management, which impact directly the well being of citizens and fiscal stability through
higher costs of rehabilitation and recovery programs after major disasters; (iv) rural

World Bank support will: (i) remain focused on programs to maintain social
stability and strengthen human capital in an environment of tight fiscal space and
(ii) broaden to address fiscal and debt sustainability issues, the growth agenda and
deepen efforts in crime and violence prevention. Jamaica’s fiscal space remains
limited and the interventions identified in the Partnership Strategy have been carefully
chosen to help the government achieve its objectives while mindful of its limited human
and financial resources, as well as limited Bank budget. The size and focus of the support
will be predicated on the country’s debt and fiscal situation, as further deterioration could
adversely impact the level of private sector investment and thereby the level of IFC
investment activities. The Bank’s Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability Series (DPL1 and
2, and possibly DPL 3), which supports the government’s medium-term fiscal and debt
sustainability reform program, will be a cornerstone for optimizing Bank Group synergies
in Jamaica.
18

The individual group discussions are summarized in Jamaica-World Bank Group Country Partnership
Strategy, 2010-2013: Consultations Report, processed (August 2009).

22

83.
The World Bank country envelope for Jamaica is known for only the first
year. The lending plans over the partnership period are indicative as it has always been.
The Bank’s capacity to lend can change over time and there is a higher degree of
certainty that lending plans indicated for the earlier years of the CPS period can be
delivered than those for the later years. The proposed pipeline is a careful balance
between DPL, investment lending and TA support (see Table 4).
84.
Through this CPS, the World Bank Group aims at (i) supporting economic
stability and (ii) promoting inclusive and sustained growth, with a particular focus on
strengthening governance. While this strategy will continue or scale up successful
support from the previous strategy, it has more focus on the growth agenda, compared to
the previous strategy, and deeper human capital development and competitiveness focus
(see Annex 2: CPS Results Chain).
Pillar I: Supporting Economic Stability, Results Area 1: Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
85.

The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes:



Medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability enhanced through fiscal consolidation
and enhanced fiscal reporting and accountability. Bank support will seek the
establishment of an institutional framework for the consolidation of all public body
accounts into central government budget process, and will support the government to
publish a consolidated public sector budget for presentation in Parliament. Approval
of a Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) in this context will improve fiscal
discipline and budgetary process. Currently, the public bodies’ expenditures exceed
that of the central government and their significant deficits contribute to government
contingent liabilities.



Improved fiscal and debt sustainability over the medium-term through decline in
total public debt-to-GDP ratio and reducing debt service and debt burden through
debt management activities. The Bank will continue to support the government with
debt management and tax administration to achieve improvements in its overall fiscal
deficit from 12.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.5 percent in 2013, and the debt-to-GDP
ratio from 139.7 percent to 124.2 percent over the same period. To these ends, the
Bank will continue to support the government with its fiscal and debt sustainability
reform program with two or three additional DPLs, and possibly an associated TA to
support expeditious implementation of the government’s reform agenda. The TA will
finance, among other areas to be agreed with the government, debt management, tax
administration and aspects of doing business. The Bank has already submitted reform
memoranda for debt management and doing business, and the USAID has submitted
reform agenda in tax administration. Bank Group support in these areas will be in
close collaboration with CDB, DFID, IDB, UNDP and USAID. In addition, a
Country Economic Memorandum in FY10 will focus on debt sustainability and
growth agenda, and inform support under the next DPL. The Bank will also seek IDF
funding for debt and tax management. The governance IDF will also contribute to the

economic stability pillar. The Bank may also provide additional non-lending technical
assistance, including monitoring and evaluation of debt through the DeMPA program.


Abolition of deferred financing for government expenditures. The Bank will seek
the enactment of the legislation abolishing the authority to permit deferred financing.

Pillar II: Promoting Inclusive Growth, Results Area 2: Strengthening Human Capital
86.

The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes:



Enhanced resource management and quality of education to be improved through
decentralized decision-making in the education system. This is one of the examples
where Bank and IFC programs are fully integrated in this CPS. The Bank will
support establishment of the necessary infrastructure for a more decentralized
education system in Jamaica, while the IFC is discussing public-private partnership
(PPP) advisory services for schools with a view to improving the quality and access
of secondary education. The main purpose of this effort would be to construct new
schools under the PPP schemes to eliminate the shift system. The cooperation
agreement recently signed with CIDA offers an opportunity for expanded advisory
services. IFC will also focus on the emerging information technology sector.



Quality of services by the early childhood institutions enhanced through
compliance of minimum standards required for registered institutions. To achieve
this outcome, the Bank is building on its experience with the Results-Based
disbursement approach, used in Jamaica as the first pilot in the Caribbean. With the
early childhood development project, it is expected that the number of early
childhood institutions that are registered and meet the minimum standards would be
increased. Overall, Bank Group support is being closely coordinated with the other
IDPs, particularly the CDB, IDB, OAS, UNICEF and USAID.



Enhanced health and education services through the conditional cash transfer
(CCT) mechanism. The Bank will contribute to achieve this outcome through its
continued support to PATH, Jamaica’s CCT mechanism, and building on its previous
successes (about 80 percent of benefits reached the poorest 40 percent of the
population; a 38 percent increase in health care visits for children younger than 6
years for CCT beneficiaries; and, it has effectively encouraged households to send
their children to school more regularly, resulting in CCT students’ school attendance
rate being three percent higher than that of similar students not in the program).



Other instruments used to contribute to achieve the above outcomes are the ongoing
HIV/AIDS project and the planned Skills for Inclusive Growth Project (FY12), which
will contribute to address the shortage of skills and education of the workforce.



In addition, a number of analytical underpinnings will be completed: The Education
PER (FY10) is being financed by the UNDP, with in-kind support from the Bank.
The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY10), which will examine the various
labor market anomalies discussed earlier and will inform projects in human
development and crime and violence prevention. The PER (FY11), Regional Nurse
Migration II (FY10) and Poverty Assessment (FY12) will also inform projects on
human development as well as in other areas in support of promoting inclusive and
sustained growth.
24

Results Area 3: Crime and Violence Prevention
87.
The CPS seeks to contribute to reduced crime and violence in the twelve inner
cities basic services project beneficiary communities. In seeking to achieving a reduction
in crime and violence in Jamaica, the Bank is adopting a new approach, which is a
departure from numerous crime prevention programs common in Jamaica and in developing
countries where single-discipline approaches (e.g., mentoring, dispute mitigation, youth at
risk programs) are implemented without evidence-based rationale, and only in the best
cases subject to rigorous process monitoring and ex-post evaluation. The Bank will be
linking the monitoring of crime patterns to programming, which will be facilitated by the
development of a cutting-edge crime and violence information platform and early warning
system for crime prevention planning and interventions across multiple disciplines.
Through its support, the Bank seeks to improve the quality of life in the targeted areas
and poor urban informal settlements through improved access to basic urban
infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, enhanced community
capacity, and improvements in public safety. Towards achieving the above outcome, the
Bank is implementing the Inner Cities Basic Services Project and the recently approved
Crime and Violence JSDF grant. A comprehensive and integrated Crime and Violence
Project (FY12) will be informed by a Country Social Assessment (FY11) and lessons
from the existing projects.
Results Area 4: Promoting Rural Development
88.
The CPS seeks to contribute to improved market penetration by small scale
producers and tourism service providers. The Bank aims to achieve this outcome
through its support to community and business groups in medium-sized farming and ecotourism to move up the supply chain. IFC efforts in support of the tourism sector will
develop linkages with the local enterprises (e.g., agribusiness), notably via advisory
services and managerial skills building.
Pillar III: Promoting Sustained Growth, Results Area 5: Strengthening non-labor
competitiveness
89.
The CPS seeks to contribute to the following outcomes: medium-sized farmers
moved up the supply chain and small scale agricultural producers received capacity
training. The ongoing rural development initiative will support medium-sized farmers to
move up the supply chain and also work with small scale agricultural producers and
tourism product providers on capacity training so that they are better integrated with the
tourism sector, rest of the economy, and the export markets.
90.
In addition, the Bank and the IFC will collaborate closely to optimize synergies in
supporting the reduction in distortions and the enhancement of the efficiency of the tax
system. The focus will be on public-private partnership, energy diversification,
conservation, efficiency and institutional training for policy analysis and regulation.
Achieving results in energy efficiency and diversification will depend on: (i) reducing the
electricity utility’s energy losses to yield significant benefits for Jamaica’s energy
security and efficiency, and (ii) strengthening the process for setting tariffs to avoid
passing utility costs to consumers, as is currently practiced, to lower energy prices and
bolster Jamaica’s competitiveness. The proposed energy program may be supplemented
with GEF grants.
25

91.
The Bank and IFC will also explore including Jamaica in the Caribbean Advanced
Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) using grant resources. This
program will follow a public-private partnership model to promote the deployment of the
required submarine regional communications infrastructure, while at the same time
ensuring that: (i) it is complemented with terrestrial broadband links; and (ii) the content
and applications are developed to increase value-added use of the infrastructure. The
program will be rolled out to the CARIFORUM countries in phases, depending on their
readiness and interest in joining the program.
92.
In investment climate, the Doing Business Reform Unit of the Bank and IFC,
included Jamaica in the Caribbean Business Enabling Environment analytical work and
separately submitted a reform memorandum around the areas covered by the Doing
Business indicators. Group support in these areas will be in close collaboration with
CDB, DFID, IDB, UNDP and USAID. Jointly with the Bank, IFC action will include
developing a better business environment for special economic zones, investment and
trade promotion. In addition, to contribute to support the government in addressing the
energy challenges, the Bank and the IFC will collaborate to optimize synergies through a
new Energy Project (FY11). The project will focus on public-private partnership, energy
diversification, conservation, efficiency and institutional training for policy analysis and
regulation, and will be informed by the two ongoing regional studies: the “Energy Study”
and the “Impact of the Financial Crisis on the Energy.”
93.
Financial markets development and access to finance – IFC will cover several
areas including supporting entrepreneurs via better access to finance through
M/SME/trade finance, and advisory services to help banks reach MSMEs market
segments. Concerning capital markets development, IFC will focus on a more regional
approach, a likely area will be the insurance market. IFC is working with the Bank in
Jamaica on credit bureau legislation, part of a Caribbean-wide initiative, which has been
presented to the Parliament for discussion, and aims at achieving sharing of credit
information between specified bodies and licensing of credit bureaus. Work done by the
Bank under fiscal and debt sustainability could eventually result in creating greater
financial market investment opportunities, which IFC could support.
94.
Infrastructure – IFC’s main areas will include energy, transport (air and road)
and logistics (supporting SEZ). Work done in energy, and to a lesser extent transport and
logistics, will be mainly driven by two cross cutting themes: climate change challenges,
and reaching the poor. IFC will be involved in supporting PPP both via its advisory
services and investments. The recently signed cooperation agreement with CIDA offers
an opportunity for expanded advisory services support by IFC to the English Speaking
Caribbean, including Jamaica. In energy, both the Bank and IFC will be advising the
government on potential investment in natural gas. IFC’s other activities may include
investments in growth sectors such as tourism and manufacturing.
Results Area 6: Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Reduction
95.


The CPS seeks to contribute to achieve the following outcomes:
Climate resilience and vulnerability reduction measures strengthened, particularly
through reduced landslide risks in an initiative in four communities. Jamaican and
Bank systems for safeguards management will be harmonized while integrating the
26

lessons learned from the JSIF Use of Country Systems pilot, and scaling-up this
initiative to other agencies. A regional GDDRR project is also supporting with
climate change issues. In addition, Jamaica will benefit from the Pilot Program for
Climate Resilience (PPCR)21 in 2010, under which country-led activities will
include: (i) pilot and demonstrate approaches for integration of climate risk and
resilience into development policies and planning; (ii) strengthen capacities at the
national levels to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scale-up
and leverage climate resilient investment, building upon other ongoing initiatives; and
(iv) enable learning-by-doing and sharing of lessons at various levels. The ongoing
JSDF grant for landslide risk reduction will strengthen the capacity of the national
disaster management agency on risk reduction and reduce landslide risks in four
vulnerable communities across the country. IFC will address climate change issues
such as raising benchmark in environmental standards and a cleaner energy mix.


Agriculture weather risk coverage introduced. The Bank will focus on the public
investment needed to design and implement public and private financial risk
management mechanisms and instruments, through the Agriculture Risk Management
Support (FY13) with potential complementary operation from IDB’s MIF to support
the private sector insurance sector. An agricultural review will examine prospects for
using agriculture to anchor development, identify cropping patterns to minimize
windstorm damage, and examine the extent and challenges of praedial larceny.

Cross-Cutting Outcome, Result Area 7: Strengthen Governance
96.
The CPS seeks to contribute to achieving more efficient financial management
and allocation of budget expenditures to achieve results. Through the DPLs, the Bank
will support the government to improve its PEFA indicators related to fiscal planning,
expenditure policy and budgeting, and to the scope, nature, and follow-up of external
audits. In addition, the Bank will support the government to implement its AuditorGeneral’s operational plan and develop internal audit plans within the ministries to
enhance availability and timeliness of information for public financial management, and
better accountability in the use of public resources. The Bank will collaborate closely
with the IDB and the EU which are also active in this area.
97.
MIGA will continue to provide political risk coverage for commercial lending to
Jamaica, consistent with this Partnership Strategy.
V.

RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION

98.
Country-level systems for poverty, economic, and human development
monitoring are being strengthened through government efforts and IDPs’ support. The
government has established a national M&E coordinating unit within the PIOJ, and is
21

The PPCR is one of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), which are interim funds developed by
Multilateral Development Banks, participating countries and other stakeholders to bridge the financing gap
prior to agreement on the next climate change regime. The PPCR was designed to enhance collaboration
between MDBs and across Development Partners in assisting countries to address climate change
adaptation. Therefore, the Jamaica PPCR would be jointly implemented, with the IDB.

27

establishing Ministerial Focal Points that would monitor the MTF implementation and its
related social outcomes. Building M&E capacity within the Ministries. The Bank recently
approved a statistics trust fund to support the national statistics strategy and will work
with the government to monitor CPS outcomes particularly in education, where capacity
building efforts are ongoing in the context of the Bank’s support for the Education
Transformation Program. The Bank is also soliciting bilateral support to deepen M&E
efforts in Jamaica. The CPS will be monitored quarterly internally and once a year with
the client along the line of a Results-Based Portfolio Review initiated in 2008.
VI.

MANAGING RISKS

99.
External and internal risks could impact significantly Bank Group support.
The most important risk in the current global crisis is economic. The global financial
crisis and resulting economic downturn has reduced demand for Jamaica’s key exports –
tourism, bauxite/alumina, and light manufacture – and reduced remittances from North
America and Europe. The crisis has also increased the government’s cost of servicing its
variable rate and US dollar-denominated debt as well as the cost of rolling over existing
debt. These developments are projected to further reduce economic growth, increase
unemployment, strain government finances, and pressure the currency. A comprehensive
fiscal and debt sustainability package is under implementation under an IMF Standby
Agreement, which also provides for increased support for the poor and the vulnerable
through the flagship conditional cash transfer program.
100. While the current economic risks are substantial, there are several mitigating
factors including ongoing macro-monitoring and country dialogue by the World Bank.
Declining oil and food prices in 2008 reduced external financing requirements. Declining
inflation also helped limit the negative impact of slower growth on the poor. In addition,
a recent DPL supported actions to improve fiscal balances and address the debt
generating process, and, thus, reduce financing vulnerabilities. Funding from the CDB,
IDB, and the World Bank mitigated a sizable portion of the external roll-over risk in
FY09/10. In FY10/11, the roll-over risk is for domestic debt. The government has also
negotiated an IMF program. A concerted effort by the CDB, IDB and World Bank over
the medium-term will also mitigate economic risks.
101. Natural disasters are a continual risk. Jamaica is highly vulnerable to multiple
natural disaster risks—particularly floods and hurricanes. The fiscal cost from past
events has been high and natural disasters have the potential to derail economic growth
and poverty reduction. They also pose a heavy fiscal burden, increasing indebtedness and
redirecting public resources away from long-run development plans. The government has
insurance against catastrophic natural disasters, is exploring the expansion of the scope
of insurance. Major private sector enterprises would be partly covered by their own
insurance. The Jamaican government participates in The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a
significant, 1-in-15 year disaster. The Bank is also assisting Jamaica through: (i)
investments in natural disaster risk mitigation; (ii) development of a risk atlas; (iii) a
community-based risk reduction pilot; and (iv) exploration of weather-related risk
insurance for agriculture.

28

102. The political risk remains significant. The government was elected in 2007
with a two seats majority. Three of its sitting members of Parliament were challenged on
dual citizenship and eligibility issue and a fourth one added later. Rather than dealing
with the issue head-on and risk a re-election, the cases were heard in the courts. The
foreign citizenships were given up and by-elections won with increased majority. The
opposition did not participate in the third court-mandated by-election. Under the
circumstances, the government’s program remains vulnerable to special interests. While
the growth slowdown and pressing financial needs may exacerbate political concerns, it
is just as likely that they may also spur consensus on the need for short-term actions. The
political risk is reduced by the government’s consultative approach to reform
implementation and the dialogue among country stakeholders on the fiscal and economic
costs of inaction. The government has been meeting with its social partners and has
discussed with the Opposition Party the limited options it has in the current environment.
There does not appear to be any short-term risk of a social unrest as demonstrated by the
recent opposition-led demonstration against increased tax measures on food.
103. Fiduciary risk is high. Financial management and procurement take on special
importance because of governance and corruption issues. The Bank mitigates this risk by
having the same fiduciary staff cover all Bank projects in the country; undertake
“sweeping” missions to cover all projects; and, since 2009, arranges regular training
and networking for implementing agencies during the “sweeping” missions.
104. Governance and crime issues could give rise to reputational risks. It is
generally believed that many persons benefit from public sub-contracts in inner-city
infrastructure rehabilitation projects, often in return for providing enforcement services to
politicians. The Bank will mitigate against this risk by careful ring fencing of projects
under supervision, including regular supervision and examination of procurement
transactions.
105. Weakness in institutional capacity in the country could hamper
implementation of the Partnership Strategy. This risk becomes more important as the
Bank broadens its areas of support and into the growth agenda. Years of fiscal constraint
has meant that many of the ministries and agencies have staff but not resources to provide
services or that the staff do not have the right skills and motivation. This situation had
been compounded by a new government with limited previous managerial experience;
the new government has to learn the skills on the job. In this environment, the Bank will
enhance dialogue and continue its existing practice of supporting a project management
team, funded by the investment project, with adequate number of staff and provision for
training to ensure efficient and effective project implementation and monitoring.
106. Following the extraordinary level of budgetary support to Jamaica proposed
in this CPS, thereis a risk that the Bank would not be in a position to provide
similar support in the future if Jamaica were to face acute and large financing needs
either because of lack of sufficient follow through in implementing critical reforms
or because of external shocks. These risks will be mitigated to some extent through
continued policy dialogue, accompanied by technical assistance as needed, and a number
of activities to mitigate and manage natural disasters, such as the CCRIF and landslide
risk reduction efforts.

Annex 3: Jamaica’s Debt Structure and Dynamics

1.
Jamaica has a high burden of public sector debt (139.7 percent of GDP estimated at
the end of FY09/10) that is about J$554,143 or US$6,212 per person. Total public debt
including domestic and external debt steadily increased from 84 percent of GDP in 1997 to a peak
of 134.1 percent of GDP in FY99/00 following the financial crisis of the mid-1990s. Since 2003,
gross public debt to GDP decreased to 113.5 percent in FY07/08, mostly due to high primary
surpluses and decreasing interest rates and is estimated to be 139.7 percent at the end of FY09/10.
In terms of its composition, domestic public debt as a share of total public debt increased from 10
percent in 1991 to 55.3 percent by end FY09/10, while the share of external debt fell from 90
percent to 44.7 percent over the same period (see Figure 1).

2.
After the initial rise in FY09/10, and FY10/11, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
decrease in the medium-term to 115.6 percent in FY13/14. The increase in debt ratios during
FY08/09 and FY09/10 are expected to be temporary reflecting the worsening global environment
and declining domestic economic activity. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline after the
next fiscal year. In particular, government debt excluding guarantees is projected to decline
substantially, reflecting the tight fiscal stance at the central government level. Regarding the
increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio in FY08/10, main contributing factors are: (i) a large increase
in the amount of external debt in local currency terms due to a 23 percent exchange rate
depreciation in FY08/09; and (ii) decline in primary budget surplus by 3.0 percent in FY08/09
(only partially covered by the following increase in FY09/10) due to the impact of the global
economic crisis and the underperformance of fiscal revenues. This unfavorable performance
resulted primarily from fiscal revenues undershooting the budget targets by 9.8 percent. Budget
expenditures were only 0.7 percent higher than the budget target in FY08/09.
3.
The composition of Jamaica’s gross public debt indicates significant exposure to
currency, interest and roll-over risks. Roughly 50 percent of the total public debt including
government guaranteed debt and PetroCaribe debt is indexed or denominated in foreign
exchange. This indicates a high exposure of Jamaican debt to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rate. The exposure of public debt to changes in interest rates is also significant, as variable-rate
instruments account for about 55 percent of the domestic and 18 percent of the external debt. By
increasing the amount of variable-rate instruments, the country has been able to extend the
maturity of domestic public debt, but it has increased the exposure of public debt to interest rate
movements. With a share above 60 percent, Jamaica has markedly relied on credit from the
private sector in its external borrowing. Only 36.7 percent is from multilateral or bilateral

45

creditors. A large portion of the domestic debt has a maturity of five year or below while 79.6
percent of the external debt has a maturity longer than 5 year.

*Note: Total public debt in this table includes central government total debt, governmentguaranteed debt and Petrocaribe debt. It excludes non-guaranteed Public Bodies debt.

4.
Stronger control of public bodies is critical for reducing the net public debt. The
primary surplus, seignorage, and real GDP growth have had a significant impact lowering debtto-GDP between FY03/04 to FY06/07. Central government primary surplus peaked at 14.3
percent of GDP in FY03/04 and remained at nearly the same level in FY04/05. Despite this high
primary surplus, debt levels hardly fell as other debt accumulating flows contributed substantially
to debt23. Other debt accumulating flows are primarily attributable to the assumption of liabilities
from public bodies. This contributed to debt growth considerably in the past seven years (14.2
percentage points of GDP in 2007/08), highlighting the importance of reforms to increase control
over the Public bodies’ debt generating process.

The rest of this annex a summary of a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
conducted using Monte Carlo simulations. A baseline scenario is constructed using the
latest projections for the Jamaican economy. Several alternative scenarios are constructed
to analyze the impact of different shocks on the path of debt to GDP ratio and to

why debt assumed by the Central Government is referred to as other debt accumulating flows.

The baseline scenario assumes fiscal consolidation. In the baseline, Jamaica is
expected to post a 6.2 percent primary surplus in FY09/10 and to further consolidate the
fiscal position in the following four years (8.0 percent primary surplus on average). The
key variables are then kept constant, with primary surplus of 9.1 percent of GDP through
FY19/2020. In the baseline, the debt to GDP ratio is estimated to be 139.7 percent of
GDP in FY09/2010 and peak the following year at 140.2 percent of GDP before
decreasing and eventually reaching 115.5 percent of GDP by FY13/14 and 65.4 percent
of GDP by FY19/20 The evolution of the debt to GDP ratio is driven by the assumptions
embedded in the baseline scenario. First, a large fiscal consolidation that generates an
improvement in the primary balance starting with the base year (FY09/10). Second, GDP
growth is projected to be higher than its average of 1.5 percent between 2003 and 2008.
Third, the real interest rate remains below its level in FY09/10 throughout the period.
6.

7.
The results of the alternative scenarios, which are generated by adjusting selected
variables, are presented in the table below. The analysis indicates that, given the global

external environment and even with the successful implementation of the government
reform plans, net debt to GDP is unlikely to fall below 100 percent of GDP by FY11/12
as originally anticipated by the government. Even under the most favorable scenario, total
debt is not expected to fall below 110 percent of GDP in FY13/14. At the same time,
however, under the most extreme scenario of no reform, debt is expected to increase from
140 percent to 143 percent of GDP over the same period.

Annex 4: Government’s Fiscal Reform Program and the Bank’s Support
1. The new programmatic DPL series envisaged under this CPS is to support the
government’s medium term reform program, which includes as a core component policy
actions aimed at fiscal sustainability.
2. The government’s fiscal sustainability reform program is part of its mediumterm socio-economic policy framework. The framework sets out the broad package of
policies, strategies and programs proposed by the Government for implementation over
the period 2009-2012, and is focused on fiscal and debt sustainability, establishment of
an efficient and equitable tax system, financial system stability and price stability. It
supports the overall vision, goals and outcomes of Jamaica’s long term development plan,
Vision 2030, and is the vehicle that transforms these long term goals and outcomes into
medium-run priorities, strategies, programs and measures. The new Fiscal Responsibility
Framework (FRF) is at the core of the Government’s reform program and will be
submitted to Parliament and implemented over the course of the next two years. It
specifies responsibilities, processes, and targets for achieving the Government’s objective
of reducing public debt to below 100 percent of GDP by 2015/16.
3. The FRF is designed to strengthen the budget process by enhancing the mechanisms
for transparency and establishing clearer goals, targets, and limits for public spending,
deficits, and debt. The government authorized the Ministry of Finance and the Public
Service in November 2008 to initiate a consultative process with stakeholders and legal
experts in order to prepare a draft FRF for Cabinet submission and then for submission to
Parliament. The FRF would introduce the principles of responsible fiscal management
through amendments to the Financial Accountability Act (FAA) and the Public Bodies
Management Act (PBMA) and also improve fiscal transparency through detailed
reporting requirements and greater parliamentary oversight over the expenditures of all
public bodies. In addition, the government has reviewed and proposed amendments to all
financial legislation to make it more manageable and to combine the various pieces into a
comprehensive public financial management act.
4. The FRF specifies that the Minister of Finance will be responsible for the
development and implementation of a fiscal policy framework, supervision and
monitoring of public financing, and coordination of international and intergovernmental
fiscal relations. Each year the Ministry of Finance will table in Parliament a fiscal policy
paper, including the Fiscal Responsibility Statement (FRS) and the Fiscal Management
Strategy (FMS). The FRS specifies an acceptable overall fiscal balance and level of total
public debt and sets out the fiscal policy measures necessary to achieve these targets. The
FMS assesses current and projected financing needs and presents a three year plan for the
development of the economy, including the level of public expenditure as percentage of
GDP. In addition, the FMS will establish targets over a set of fiscal indicators, e.g.,
annual public borrowing, the overall balance, and the primary balance. The MOF will
also provide an explanation to Parliament in the event of any deviation from these targets
and the Minister will have to inform Parliament of any changes in policy.

49

Annex 4
Page 2 of 3

5. The objective of the FRF is to achieve explicit targets for public debt, public sector
wage bill, and the overall fiscal balance. A central feature of the FRF is the emphasis on
greater transparency in the preparation of annual estimates of revenue and expenditure
and any changes in policies or practices. The Auditor General will review the fiscal
policy paper to ensure that it complies with the principles of prudent fiscal management.
These principles are specified in the FRF as prudent management of contingent liabilities,
maintenance of debt at sustainable level, gearing of borrowing towards productive
purposes, and management of expenditures at levels consistent with revenues.
6. Public bodies’ rationalization is being facilitated by the new Public Sector
Transformation Unit in the Cabinet office. A strategic action plan has been submitted
to Cabinet with a view to facilitating the establishment of an efficient, responsive and
cost effective framework of operations for the Public Sector, consistent with good
governance, and in line with the government’s development objectives. This action plan
was developed by the Public Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU), launched by the Prime
Minister and has been fully operational since November 2009. The PSTU’s
recommendations are to be implemented through transition teams in each Ministry. The
scope of work of the PSTU includes: (i) prior reviews of all Ministries, Departments and
Agencies, including Public Bodies, to determine what functions should be retained,
privatized, contracted out, abolished or be merged with other sector entities; (ii) the
development of a master rationalization plan with milestones and cost estimates; (iii) the
implementation of a Government Wide Network (GovNet) including establishment of
integrated IT systems; and (iv) the implementation a Strategic Human Resource
Management Structure/System. The government expects the PSTU to complete its work
during a period of 18 months (by May 2011). Implementation of reforms by transition
teams are expected to take place during and after this period. The PSTU is working with
a Consultative Monitoring Group, fully functional since December 2009, including
representatives from the private sector, universities and trade unions, to ensure extensive
consultations and engagement in social dialogue with stakeholders at all levels.
7. The FRF also includes measures aimed at improving the governance of public
entities. Critical amendments to the PBMA have been submitted for Parliamentary
approval as part of the FRF. The key features of these amendments include: (a)
prohibiting Public Bodies from entering into negotiations to issue debt without prior
approval by the Minister of Finance; (b) requiring Public Bodies to submit corporate
plans and any modifications to the Minister of Finance for endorsement and the
Parliament for approval; (c) requiring the Minister of Finance to prepare an annual report
to Parliament of estimates of revenue and expenditure for all Public Bodies; and (d)
requiring Public Bodies to submit information on their financial operations to the
Financial Secretary. These amendments also include regulations to strengthen the
Financial Distribution Policy, Acquisition of Shares, Code of Conduct for Directors, and
Code of Audit Practices. Additionally, the Ministry of Finance is providing training in
corporate governance to the leadership of Public Bodies.
8. In an unprecedented departure, the FRF includes a provision for submission of public
bodies’ accounts to Parliament for approval; this will directly support the PSTU’s
strategy to improve public sector governance. The annual Budget Memorandum in
FY2010/11 will include a discussion of the movements of the consolidated public sector
50

Annex 4
Page 3 of 3

with a summary table showing at least the main aggregates for the consolidated public
sector. The inevitable data gaps and discrepancies would be acknowledged and addressed
over time, but such consolidated budgeting and reporting should help to support the
measures proposed under the FRF. Clear targets would also be set for expanding the
coverage and quality of reporting in the annual Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure
report for public entities. The government is aiming to increase the coverage of entities
complying with “Statement A” reporting. Milestones in producing consolidated fiscal
accounts (consistent with international Government Financial Statistics standards) will
also be established. The winding-up of inactive public bodies would be completed within
a reasonable timeframe (e.g. end-2010). The costs and benefits of the program should be
evaluated, including any fiscal savings, and published on the Ministry’s webpage.
9. Progress has been achieved in improving Tax Administration and further
improvements are being sought. The government has been implementing a major Tax
Administration reform to increase the tax base, enforce compliance, increase efficiency
and effectiveness of the Tax Administration and Customs Department, and thereby boost
government revenues. In FY09/10, the government's tax reform efforts focus on:
improving compliance, improving information and communication technology, and
improving enforcement. The authorities have received support from the World Bank, US
Treasury, IRS, CARTAC and USAID.
10. In the context of tax administration reform, a number of important steps have been
undertaken: i) a large taxpayer office was established on April 15, 2009 with two offices
in Kingston and Montego Bay. As of end-December 2009, the 205 largest taxpayers were
covered and the authorities are aiming at taking 200 more companies into the scope of the
Office by end FY2009/10; ii) a Customer Care center was established on April 1, 2009
with the objective of improving customer service, standardizing the response to tax
related inquiries by tax payers, and keeping tax payers current with their taxes. The
Center covers the entire country and all types of taxes; iii) a Forensic Data Mining Unit
was established in June 2009. The Unit is increasing tax compliance and enforcement by
making use of forensic techniques to gather information about the tax obligations of tax
payers and check this against the actual filing of taxes so as to prevent tax evasion; iv) a
High Intensity Team was established in June 2009. The team is comprised of auditors and
collectors and put forward a combined effort to improve collections. The Team will act as
a field extension of the Forensic Data Mining Unit; v) a Special Enforcement Team was
established in July 2009. The Team is comprised of 6 people and focuses on enforcing
compliance after other efforts have failed.
11. The Government’s reform agenda is part of a well-specified, medium-term program
designed to support macroeconomic stability and the achievement of fiscal and debt
sustainability to further longer-run development objectives. The reform program is
ambitious and substantive, and is expected to be completed over a period of two years
due to the perception within the country that the need for fiscal and debt management
reform is urgent. Therefore, the Bank’s support to the Government’s program is proposed
as a series of two programmatic development policy operations. The policy actions and
outcome indicators supported by the proposed programmatic DPL series are sequenced to
match the government’s phased approach to reforms, which is necessary in the context of
the specific conditions and procedures that prevail in Jamaica.

Annex 5: CAS Completion Report
Country: Jamaica
Date of CAS: April 2005
CAS Completion Report Prepared by: Prem C. Garg

I.

Period: FY06-09

INTRODUCTION

1. This completion report reviews the implementation of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) covering Bank assistance to Jamaica during FY06-09. The CAS was
approved by the Board in April 2005 and a progress report on its implementation was
presented to the Board on July 19, 2007. The report assesses the alignment of the Bank
strategy with Jamaica’s long-term strategic goals, the extent to which intended outcomes
are being achieved, and the Bank performance in contributing to those achievements.
Drawing from the experience in implementing this CAS, the report concludes with
lessons for designing future Bank assistance to Jamaica.
2. In addition to discussions with the country team, the assessment is based on reviews
of relevant program documents such as the CAS, the CAS Progress Report, Project
Appraisal Documents, Project Implementation Status and Results Reports, Reports on
Analytical and Advisory Activities, Implementation Completion Reports and IEG/QAG
evaluations and assessments. A one week country visit to Jamaica provided the
opportunity to solicit feedback from key government counterparts, other development
partners in Jamaica, selected stakeholders from the Jamaican civil society as well as some
of the potential beneficiaries under the Bank-supported projects. Lists of the key Bank
and non-Bank individuals consulted in preparing this completion report as well as the
project sites visited during the country visit are shown in Annex 5A.

II.

JAMAICA’S LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS

3. The 2005 CAS was guided by Jamaica’s Medium-Term Socioeconomic Policy
Framework (MTF) for 2004-07. The Framework noted the numerous economic reforms
Jamaica had undertaken since the early 1980s to reduce poverty by increasing the role of
market forces in allocating resources, fostering private sector activity, overhauling the
trade policy and trade regime, restructuring of the financial sector, enhancing human
capital, and improving social protection. While lauding Jamaica’s relatively good social
indicators, the Framework lamented, however, the disappointing performance overall
with low economic growth, large public debt, weak export performance, low
productivity, weak institutions, poor educational performance, environmental degradation
and, above all, an exceptionally high incidence of violent crime.
4. Going forward the MTF outlined the following key macro- and social policy
objectives for the medium-term:


Maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework (keeping inflation in single digit
range, accelerating GDP growth to above 3%, eliminating budget deficit by 2005/06,
52

Annex 5
Page 2 of 15







maintaining competitive exchange rate, and reducing debt to GDP ratio to less than
100%);
Eradication of poverty and increased social inclusion for the poor (reducing
vulnerability of the poor, increased access to housing and sanitation, and use of
participatory approaches in developing policies and programs);
Improved education and health status for the population (improved access and quality
for both primary and secondary education, prevention and control of morbidity and
mortality, prevention and treatment HIV/AIDS);
Creation of a safe and secure Jamaica (reduction in violent crimes, reform of the
Justice sector to provide improved access to justice);
Improved governance (enhanced public sector efficiency, increased openness in
public management); and
Environmental sustainability (sustainable management of Jamaica’s natural
resources).

5. Judged against the expectations articulated in the MTF, Jamaica’s progress towards
the above goals over the CAS period (FY06-09) must be considered mixed at best. While
some modest gains were made in reducing poverty and in better-targeting of Jamaica’s
social programs, there was virtually no progress towards achieving macroeconomic
stability. The governance indicators also deteriorated; as per Transparency International
rankings, Jamaica slipped from 57 in 2003 to 84 (out of 132 countries) in 2007. Jamaica
scored particularly poorly on public security – in turn, a reflection of persistently high
violent
crime
rate.

Achieving price stability also proved to be an elusive goal with annual inflation

Government’s primary surplus was also no where close to the targeted 14% and as a
result little progress was made in bringing the national debt to a more manageable level.

7. Reinforcing the worrisome macro-economic performance is the perception of
broader weakening of the rule of law, exemplified by Jamaica’s high murder rate – over
1,600 people (or 64 per 100,000 population) were murdered in 2008, making Jamaica one
of the most violent places in the world.
8. The main bright spots in this generally dismal picture are the continuing reduction in
absolute poverty with the country well-positioned to reach most of the MDGs25 (Annex
5B). However, sustainability of these gains on the social front also remains a question
mark given the fragile macro-economic situation as well as the likely fall out from the
current global financial crisis.
9. Although in part the disappointing performance over the past few years is due to
external shocks (2007 Hurricane Dean, sharp increase in food and fuel prices during
2006/07, and the recent global financial turmoil), it also reflects design weaknesses in the
MTF itself. Specifically, the MTF


was more a statement of good intentions rather than a coherent program of priority
actions consistent with the country’s financial and institutional capacities; would have
benefited from a critical analysis of the reasons behind Jamaica’s lagging macroeconomic performance over the previous two decades and the lessons from the failed
reform efforts of the past;



suffered from inadequate attention to sources of growth and to the role of primary
sectors such as agriculture;



did not focus adequately on the efficiency and sustainability of public expenditures in
social sectors (e.g., financing of tertiary education, attention to broader health sector
issues beyond HIV/AIDS);
did not address adequately the issues of corruption and the rapid growth of the
underground economy; and
did not take into account adequately the natural disasters that impact Jamaica on a
regular basis.




10. Thus, while the goals and aspirations articulated in the MTF were unexceptionable,
and still remain valid, the Framework provided little guidance on how they were to be
achieved, especially considering the financial, institutional, environmental, and sociopolitical constraints facing Jamaica.

III.

CAS OUTCOMES

11.
The World Bank Group Strategy for 2006-09 was designed around three mutually
reinforcing pillars (accelerating inclusive economic growth; improving human
development and opportunity; and crime prevention and reduction) and two crosscutting themes (governance and environmental sustainability). The strategy was based
on a close collaboration with the government and was consistent with the goals outlined
in the MTF. Not surprisingly, the CAS suffered from some of the same weaknesses as the
25

Two notable exceptions being performance vis-à-vis child mortality and maternal mortality goals.

54

Annex 5
Page 4 of 15

MTF. Despite that, the Bank was able to make a positive contribution to Jamaica’s
longer-term goals although not as much as it could have had its strategy been
underpinned by a more critical assessment of the realism and implementability of the
MTF. In particular, many of the risks noted in the CAS (natural disasters, external
economic shocks, policy slippage/slow implementation and limited fiscal space) did
materialize and should have gotten more attention in designing of the CAS program.
12.
Since the Jamaica CAS design did not incorporate a results framework with
monitorable CAS outcomes, this evaluation has to be based on intended outcomes and
results chains inferred from discussions in the CAS text and from elaborations in the CAS
Progress Report. A retrofitted results summary matrix building on the work done under
the CAS Progress Report is shown in Annex 5B. The CAS implementation also suffered
from a lack of systematic monitoring and reporting of intended outcomes, leading to
weak empirical underpinning for the CAS evaluation. Unavoidably, therefore, this
evaluation includes an added layer of subjective judgments, over and above what is
normal for such evaluations. Also, in the absence of data on specific CAS outcomes,
country outcomes that this CAS was intended to support take on added importance.
13.
As discussed below, the performance along each of the three CAS pillars as well
as for the Environmental Sustainability theme is rated as moderately satisfactory. In
contrast, the performance under the Governance theme is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory. The performance for the CAS as a whole is rated as moderately
satisfactory. The summary ratings reflects scope for improving upon the CAS program
through better focus and greater realism in defining the CAS objectives coupled with
generally satisfactory outcomes at the individual product level.
Pillar I: Accelerating Inclusive Economic Growth (Moderately Satisfactory)
14.
Pillar I was intended to promote two main objectives: achievement of
macroeconomic stability; and reduction of poverty and increased social inclusion for the
poor. The Bank CAS was to contribute to the first objective by providing access to
broader information base for informed policy making through analytical and advisory
work. In parallel, the Bank’s lending program was to support the “inclusion” objective
through streamlining and better targeting of the education and health services under the
PATH26 program.
15.
Going by Jamaica’s macroeconomic trends over the past few years (Para. 6), the
performance on the first objective was clearly unsatisfactory. Considering that the Bank’s
contribution in this area was to be primarily through analytical work, surprisingly little
effort was devoted to analytical work and economic monitoring during the CAS period;
AAA expenditures during the CAS period amounted to less than 10% of the country
services budget compared to 25-30% share in most other countries (Para. 43). The CAS
should have also been more forthright in assessing the realism of MTF’s macroeconomic
targets and in recognizing the limitations of the CAS approach in influencing actual

26

Jamaica’s National Program for Advancement through Health and Education.

55

Annex 5
Page 5 of 15

government policies and programs. More proactive follow-up and dissemination of the
findings of the pre-CAS analytical work would have also been helpful.
16.
An encouraging development in this respect is the recent approval of a US$100
million Development Policy Loan (DPL) to support fiscal and debt sustainability
following more intensive engagement on macro-economic issues between the Bank and
the newly elected government in Jamaica. The DPL is focused on: (i) aligning the budget
to medium-term expenditure priorities; (ii) improving efficiency of public sector
spending through public sector reform; and (iii) lowering public debt to reduce
macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The DPL complements parallel support from IDB and the
EU, the other two major development partners in Jamaica. It is a step in the right
direction in addressing Jamaica’s chronic macro imbalances; however, it is coming too
late in the current CAS cycle to affect outcomes for this CAS. Also, given the severity of
Jamaica’s macroeconomic difficulties, the reform program will need sustained efforts and
support over several years if it is to move Jamaica away from the economic stagnation of
the past two decades. It is too early to tell whether the GOJ and its development partners
will have the will and the staying power to sustain these efforts over the long term. Some
of the stakeholders, especially IDB, wondered whether the single tranche design of the
DPL implied less than total commitment by the World Bank to the reform program
adopted by the GOJ.
17.
As to the second objective under this pillar, the CAS appears to have made a
significant contribution to provide better and more cost-effective social assistance to the
poor under the Social Safety Net Project. Through support for the PATH program, the
Project had as of September 2008, reached about 300,000 beneficiaries, almost half of
whom were from the poorest quintile (and 80% from the two poorest quintiles). The
project contributed to the consolidation of the major cash assistance programs into the
PATH program and also supported desirable behavioral changes to encourage human
capital development of the poor children.
18.
Also commendable was the Bank support channeled through the Jamaica Social
Investment Fund (JSIF) for demand-driven, community infrastructure (especially for
education, health and roads) under the National Community Development Program
(NCDP). Performance indicators monitored as part of the NCDP completion report show
significantly improved student performance and increased usage of health care facilities
in communities served under that Project. The JSIF itself is a good example of successful
institution building in Jamaica through sustained support by the Bank. These gains
however need to be tempered by the fact that the related CAS milestones—adoption of
legislation to mainstream PATH as a conditional cash transfer mechanism; and
introduction of special bonuses for secondary school students to minimize drop-outs—are
still pending suggesting need for further consensus building within Jamaica around those
programs.
19.
The Bank assistance for macro-economic stabilization and inclusive growth was
complemented by support from IFC and MIGA to the private sector for addressing the
infrastructural constraints and supporting financial markets development. IFC’s activities
in Jamaica were part of its broader effort to support growth and competitiveness in the
English Speaking Caribbean. IFC mobilized two loans totaling US$46 million (including
$20 million from syndicating banks) for development and expansion of the Montego Bay
56

Annex 5
Page 6 of 15

Airport, the main gateway for tourist arrivals to Jamaica. As a result of these investments,
the Airport’s annual handling capacity has been boosted to 9 million passengers a year,
eliminating capacity constraints for the foreseeable future. IFC also provided a $123
million (of which $50 million through syndication) to Jamaica Energy Partners, an
independent power producer to help finance the expansion of its power plant from 74.2
MW to 123.6 MW. Finally, IFC provided US$68 million of assistance to support lending
to Micro, Small and Medium sized enterprises as well as to promote insurance services
and real estate development27. IFC is also advising then Government in designing and
implementing the strategy for privatization of the national airline, Air Jamaica. MIGA’s
contribution included two guarantees for a total of $79.2 million to help double the
capacity of the Kingston Port Container Terminal to over 3 million 20-foot containers
(equivalent units) per year.
Pillar II: Improving Human Development and Opportunity (Moderately
Satisfactory)
20.
Pillar II also supported two main objectives: Improved access to and quality of
education; and HIV/AIDS prevention and care. Support under the first objective was to
be focused on secondary education (through the ongoing ROSE II project) and on early
childhood development (through preparation and implementation of a sector-wide
strategy to bring congruence to the programs of several donors active in the sub-sector).
The ROSE II project, nearing completion, appears to have positively influenced learning
outcomes through improved teaching methodologies and through locally determined
school improvement sub-projects in 99 targeted schools. The project also supported
construction of two new secondary schools (creation of 800 additional places) in underserved areas. To address the needs of children from poor households, the project included
a scholarship program to support placement of 450 poor children in private schools.
However, for reasons not fully understood, the scholarship program experienced
significant drop-outs and the number of students successfully completing the three-year
program is likely to miss the target.
21.
In early childhood development, a sector-wide strategy was prepared with
financing by a PHRD grant from Japan and the strategy is now being financed by a $15
million loan from the Bank. The project aims to: (i) improve the monitoring of children’s
development, the screening of household level risks, and the risk mitigation and early
intervention systems; (ii) enhance the quality of early childhood schools and care
facilities; and (iii) strengthen Early Childhood organizations and institutions. After
several delays, the project became effective on February 9, 2009 and project mobilization
is under way; nonetheless, due to capacity constraints in the Early Childhood
Commission, the main GOJ counterpart, successful project implementation will require
continuing intensive support from the Bank. Feedback from other partners active in the
sub-sector (especially, the UNICEF) during the CASCR mission also suggests the need
for further efforts at building consensus around the project approach and strategy. In
particular, questions remain about whether the ECD Commission should only have policy
27

US$20 million to First Global Bank for on-lending to MSMEs, US$30 million to National Commercial
Bank of Jamaica to support its diversification of funding sources and strengthen its balance sheet, and
US$18 million to First Jamaica Investment Limited to support its real estate development projects.

57

Annex 5
Page 7 of 15

making and regulatory functions or whether it should also have direct implementation
responsibilities as stipulated under the project.
22.
Both the ROSE II project and the ECD project appear well-targeted to the sectoral
needs and priorities. However, both would have benefited from greater realism during
the design/appraisal stage. The Rose II project was clearly over dimensioned in relation
to the fiscal space, necessitating painful restructuring and cancellations. The ECD project,
on the other hand, appears to have underestimated the institutional constraints in
launching a new initiative such as that—leading to delayed effectiveness and a slow takeoff.
23.
From the Education sector perspective, a key missed opportunity concerned
engaging the government on the overall financing for the sector, especially the issue of
financing and cost recovery for tertiary education. Considering the unusually high unit
costs for the tertiary education28 and considering that the tertiary education mostly
benefits the better-off segments of the population29, both efficiency and equity
considerations would suggest revisiting of the current financing patterns, keeping in mind
of course the political sensitivity of the issue. An Education Sector Transformation
project is currently under preparation for approval in FY10 and is expected to address this
gap.
24.
CAS support under the second objective of this pillar was aimed at assisting the
government in curbing the spread of HIV through: (a) the expansion of preventive
programs; (b) the strengthening of treatment, care and support for people living with
HIV/AIDS; and (c) and strengthening of Jamaica’s multi-sectoral capacity to respond to
the epidemic. The two Bank-supported HIV/AIDS projects appear to have played
important catalytic role in leveraging resources from various donors in successfully
addressing the issues. The projects have made significant contribution to the expansion of
preventive services for the at-risk population; and for treatment, care and support for
people infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS. The projects helped in the development
and adoption of the National HIV/AIDS policy, development of HIV policies in various
sectors as well as preparation of the new National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2007-12).
The projects also helped foster an environment that reduces stigma and discrimination by
sensitizing and mobilizing community leaders and opinion makers in support of the HIV
programs. A particularly noteworthy achievement of the program is the reduction in
mother to child transmission rate from 25% in 2002 to 5% in 2008. The main unfinished
agenda in this regard concerns delay in amending the Public Health Act due to the slow
legislative processes.
25.
As in case of the Education sector, the Bank missed an opportunity to be even
more effective by not focusing adequately on the broader Health sector issues, including
the deterioration in quality of health care, financial sustainability of the sectoral
expenditures, and the lack of progress on MDGs related to infant mortality and maternal
mortality. Given the progress made on the HIV/AIDS issue, any future support in the

58

Annex 5
Page 8 of 15

sector should take a more comprehensive perspective of the sectoral constraints and
priorities including the shifting morbidity and mortality profiles towards the noncommunicable diseases.
Pillar III: Crime Prevention and Reduction (Moderately Satisfactory)
26.
The key outcome under Pillar III was to develop an effective community crime
prevention system. The CAS support to that end included both AAA and lending. The
study on Caribbean Crime, Violence and Development, prepared jointly with the UN
Office on Drugs and Crime, was a high quality product, well received all around. The
study analyzed the implications of crime for growth, highlighting crime as a
developmental issue, and promoting new methodologies to address crime prevention and
reduction. Going by the numerous favorable references made to the study by various
stakeholders during the CASCR mission, the Bank also did a good job of disseminating
its findings and the study is playing an important role in shaping stakeholder views on the
crime problem in Jamaica.
27.
The Inner City Basic Services Project is the other major intervention under this
Pillar of the CAS. The project supports demand-driven infrastructural investments to help
improve quality of life in 12 crime-prone inner city areas. Specifically, the project aims
to: (a)increase access and improve the quality of water, sanitation, solid waste collection
systems, electricity, roads, drainage and related community infrastructure for over 60,000
residents of poor urban settlements; (b) facilitate access to microfinance for enterprise
development and home improvements; (c) increase security of tenure for households in
the project areas; and (d) enhance public safety through mediation services, community
capacity building, skills training and related social services. It is an innovative project
with potentially high rewards. However, the project design and appraisal were not as
thorough as they could have been. Notwithstanding the large expenditures on project
preparation (financed through a PHRD grant), the project suffered from poor quality
technical designs suggesting inadequate oversight of the survey and design work. The
implementation has also suffered delays due to difficulties in attracting qualified
contractors to work on infrastructural sub-projects located in high crime areas. Also of
concerns are the delays in the process for regularization of land tenure for the urban poor.
With the first batch of project-funded facilities coming on stream in the near future, the
project supervision also needs to give greater attention to the O&M aspects of the
completed facilities. Given the multi-dimensional nature of the crime problem in
Jamaica, and the need to show visible results to change the mindsets in the affected
communities, it will be unreasonable to expect quick results.
Cross-Cutting Theme I: Governance. (Moderately Unsatisfactory)
28.
Although good governance was considered “fundamental to the strategic
objectives of the Government” and governance was a cross-cutting theme under the CAS,
the CAS included little substantive analysis of the underlying issues or of the Bank
strategy for addressing the problem. Most explicit of the governance-related CAS
objectives were expansion of participatory framework to promote active community
involvement in development projects and strengthening of the country financial
management and procurement systems to improve accountability and transparency in the
59

Annex 5
Page 9 of 15

use of public resources. Other objectives mentioned in the CAS included to enhance
public sector efficiency by strengthening link between policy, planning and budget
allocation and strengthening of the regulatory framework to promote fair competition and
encourage private investment. The CAS paid little explicit attention to the issues related
to corruption and growth of the underground economy.
29.
The overall performance appears decidedly mixed. Good progress has been made
in promoting community involvement in the selection and implementation of community
infrastructure through NCDP and ICBS projects – leading to better sub-project selection,
and improved sustainability of the facilities due to greater ownership by the
beneficiaries30. The Country Fiduciary Assessment, done jointly with the IDB, helped
identify important issues for strengthening Jamaica’s procurement and financial
management systems and the follow-up is being supported through an IDF grant. The
feedback from many implementing agencies indicated, however, continuing delays and
difficulties related to GOJ’s procurement procedures and practices, suggesting the need
for a more concerted follow-up in this regard.
30.
Not unexpectedly, nothing much happened on the other two objectives given that
the CAS had no concrete plans for pursuing those objectives. The CAS Progress Report
attempted to concretize the public sector reform objective by narrowing it down to
improving the planning, budgeting and monitoring systems in the Ministry of Education
through the ROSE II project. However, even that narrower objective got derailed due to a
questionable dropping of the governance component following restructuring of the ROSE
II project31.
31.
The recently approved DPL brings much needed attention to the governance
theme—a theme crucial to the longer-term prospects for Jamaica. Among other things,
the DPL supports actions aimed at rationalization of public bodies, improving efficiency
and effectiveness of public sector compensation and incentives, improving the accounting
and financial reporting system, improving internal and external control systems, reducing
distortions in the tax systems, and enhancing the tax administration32. This is a large
agenda and significant progress will require sustained efforts over several years.
32.
Were it not for the actions initiated under the DPL, the CAS performance under
the governance theme would have merited an unsatisfactory rating.
Cross-cutting Theme II: Environmental Sustainability (Moderately
Satisfactory)
33.
In the absence of a comprehensive assessment of the environmental challenges
and options facing Jamaica, the agenda under the environmental sustainability theme
30

Based on the beneficiary feedback the community-based contracting under these projects also
contributed to skills development in the community including development of management skills,
bookkeeping skills, conflict resolution and communication skills, and construction skills

31

This is likely to be taken up as part of the Educational Transformation Project, currently under
preparation (Para. 23).
32
This would be complemented by parallel support from IDB for improving the incentive framework and
the business environment for the private sector.

60

Annex 5
Page 10 of 15

focused on two outcomes: enhancing GOJ’s capacity to respond to natural catastrophes
and mainstreaming environmental consideration in investment planning. The Bank did a
commendable job in helping Jamaica participate in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility (CCRIF) against natural hazards. The Bank also showed commendable
flexibility and speed both in modifying NCDP following the Hurricane Ivan and in
approving an Emergency Recovery Loan to help Jamaica deal with the aftermath of
Hurricane Dean. The Emergency Loan, being implemented through the JSIF, aims to
restore basic community infrastructure in education, health and transport damaged by the
Hurricane Dean and also to increase the GOJ’s ability to respond to natural hazards. After
a somewhat slow start, the project now appears to be progressing satisfactorily. As
regards mainstreaming of environmental considerations, certification of JSIF for ISO
14000 is a major achievement allowing the Bank to rely on country’s own environmental
management systems.
34. Considering the frequency with which natural catastrophes impact Jamaica, the CAS
was remiss in not recognizing and addressing such threats more proactively (e.g., through
greater realism in target-setting as well as contingency planning). The CAS would have
also benefited from a comprehensive Country Environmental Assessment to help define
the priority agenda for future support by the Bank under this theme.

IV.

BANK PERFORMANCE

34.
The overall Bank performance for the CAS period is rated moderately
satisfactory based on missed opportunities as well as scope for improvement in terms of
Quality of Products and Services, in portfolio management, and in Country Dialogue and
Aid Coordination.
A. Quality of Products and Services (Moderately Satisfactory)
35.
Program delivery: Lending. The planned and actual lending deliveries over the
CAS period are summarized in Annex E.3. The CAS proposed a base case lending
program of $75 million for four investment projects during FY06-09. The high case
scenario included an additional $75 million for policy-based lending subject to
satisfactory portfolio performance as well as satisfactory macroeconomic performance in
line with the GOJ’s MTF. Based on the encouraging macroeconomic trends during
2006/07, Jamaica was shifted to the high case as part of the CAS Progress Report to the
Board in July, 2007. Although the improvements in macro-economic trends reported in
the CAS PR turned out to be short-lived, the change in government following the October
2007 elections led to a more intensive dialogue between GOJ and the Bank, and steppedup lending by the Bank going beyond the confines of the original CAS.
36. Actual deliveries during the CAS period comprised six operations for a total of
$204.3 million substantially above the level envisaged under the base case scenario. In
part, the enlarged program reflected emergency response to Hurricane Dean. More
importantly, however, it reflected recalibration of the assistance strategy in light of the
new government’s resolve to address the long standing economic problems of Jamaica.
Most important manifestation of this new relationship was a $100 million Development
Policy Loan (DPL) by the Bank approved in January 2009 to help initiate policy and
61

Annex 5
Page 11 of 15

institutional reforms to put Jamaica on a sustainable development path (Para. 16). A
follow-up operation to continue the reforms initiated under DPL I is also under
preparation.
37.
Of the four projects envisaged under the CAS, two –the Inner City Basic Services
Project (ICBS) and the Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project—have already been
approved, the latter, one year behind schedule due to delays in preparation. The third
project (Youth at Risk), expanded and refocused on continuation of support for the PATH
program, has also been approved through a $40 million loan in FY08. The fourth project
(Rural Development) is under preparation and is expected to be delivered in FY10. The
project will build on the successful experience under NCDP I but unlike that project will
focus on support for productive investments to stimulate growth of the rural economy by
enabling farmers to better access markets and by encouraging pro-poor tourism. A
commendable feature of both the ECD project and the Social Protection project is the
move made towards the SWAp modality, thereby bringing added focus on outputs and
outcomes as well as greater reliance on GOJ’s own budgetary and fiduciary mechanisms.
38.
Besides the two unplanned operations noted in para. 36 (Emergency Recovery
Loan for Hurricane Dean and the DPL), the actual program also included one other
project not foreseen under the CAS—A US$10 million loan to help sustain past Bank
support for combating HIV/AIDS. Given the multiplicity of donors active in the
HIV/AIDS area, as well as emerging health sector priorities, there is some question as to
whether the overall impact could have been increased through shifting the focus of this
operation on broader health sector issues accompanied, if necessary, by some support for
sustaining the gains of the previous project through Additional Financing. A constraining
factor in that respect appears to have been the lack of sound diagnostic analysis of the
health sector to underpin the design of a broader health sector project.
39.
Excepting a few isolated cases, the lending program during the CAS period
appears well targeted to the country priorities and was suitably adjusted to take account
of the emerging opportunities and needs. None of the six projects approved during the
CAS period has been subject to a Quality at Entry assessment by QAG and hence there is
no independent feedback available on the design quality of these projects. However,
summary reviews for the CASCR suggest that generally the projects were well-designed
with due attention to fiduciary and safeguard aspects as well as to lessons from the past.
An area for improvement would have been the results frameworks underpinning these
projects as well as the M&E arrangements for tracking progress during implementation.
Missing base line data also appeared to be a common problem. Ensuring better readiness
for implementation before approval should be another priority to help minimize
subsequent delays in project effectiveness and extension of closing dates.
40. In some cases, the project designs could have also been improved through more
careful attention to the contextual factors. Thus, for example a better recognition of the
fiscal constraints bearing upon the ROSE II project would have avoided the painful
restructuring that the project had to go through subsequently. Similarly, greater attention
to the social setting bearing on the ICBS project would have avoided some of the
contracting problems being experienced now. The recently approved ECD project would
have also benefited from greater recognition of the difficulties in launching a new
initiative such as that.
62

Annex 5
Page 12 of 15

41. Overall, the lending program delivery appears to have been managed efficiently
with delivery costs and elapsed times well below the Bank norms. The elapsed time
between Board approval and PCN issuance averaged 7.6 months compared to the Bankwide average of 14.3 months. The average delivery cost for the six Jamaica operations
($326,000) also compares favorably with the Bank-wide average ($341,000). Also
indicative of the efficient management of the lending pipeline is the negligible amount
spent on “dropped” projects.
42. Program delivery: AAA (Moderately Unsatisfactory). Based on the country
service budget data for Jamaica during FY06-0933, out of a total expenditure of $4.35
million, only about $350,000 was spent on AAA—less than 9% of the total budget and
far below the 25-30% range found in most Bank country programs. Altogether, there
were just four AAA tasks undertaken by the Bank during the CAS period: Poverty
Analysis, FSAP, Energy Sector Policy and TA for Addressing Debt Problems.
43. The sparse AAA expenditure for Jamaica during the CAS period needs to be seen,
of course, in the context of an extensive program of studies undertaken by the Bank
focusing on the Caribbean Region as a whole. Over the four-year CAS period, seven
regional studies were completed including Caribbean Growth and Competitiveness
(FY06), Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Review (FY06), Caribbean Infrastructure
Assessment (FY06), Caribbean Skills Enhancement FY07), Caribbean Pensions (FY07),
Caribbean Crime and Violence (FY07), Caribbean Air Transport (FY07), and The
Canada-Caribbean Remittance Corridor (FY09) with a total delivered cost of $1.6
million. Many of these regional studies were indeed of relevance to Jamaica and helped
in the Bank country dialogue. However, for Jamaica to match the Bank wide norms on
AAA spending, an improbably high two-thirds of the total budget for the regional studies
would have to be allocated to Jamaica. Thus, the Bank resources devoted to AAA were
rather low, suggesting significant under-investment by the Bank in building its
knowledge base to underpin effective country dialogue. Some of the issues/areas that
would have benefited from additional analytical work included:


better understanding of Jamaica’s dismal record with past reform efforts and lessons
for the future from that experience;



robustness of the statistical base underpinning Jamaica’s national accounts and its
possible impact on assessing Jamaica’s economic growth trends;



the priority agenda for controlling the underground economy in Jamaica;



issues and priorities for putting Jamaica’s social sector (especially health and
education) on a sustainable path for the medium to long–term;



issues and priorities in managing Jamaica’s natural resources and environment; and



Issues and priorities in stimulating growth of the rural economy34.

44. Feedback from the stakeholders during the CASCR mission suggests that the Bank
AAA is well-regarded all around for its analytical quality. The Bank needs to do however
33

Only partial data for FY09; the overall picture is however unlikely to change even with complete data for
FY09.
34
Apparently, a study of the Jamaica Rural Economy was initiated but dropped in FY07 before completion.

63

Annex 5
Page 13 of 15

a better job of disseminating the findings and recommendations of its AAA, especially to
stakeholders outside of GOJ and especially for the regional studies relevant to Jamaica.
Many stakeholders were unaware of the Bank’s regional studies, thus reducing their
potential impact. (The report on Crime Violence and Development was a notable
exception in this respect). Other areas for greater attention included more systematic
economic monitoring and non-lending technical assistance to support capacity building
for implementation of complex institutional reforms.
45. Considering that the country budget is being used rather efficiently with little scope
for reallocations away from lending and supervision work, it would appear that
addressing the AAA gaps will require some augmentation of the country budget; that
should not be unreasonable given shift of the Jamaica program to the High case scenario.
B. Portfolio Management (Moderately Satisfactory)
46. To-date four projects35 have closed during the CAS period and another one (ROSE
II) is expected to close on June 30, 2009. Although none of the closed projects has yet
been evaluated by the IEG, staff ratings of project status in the respective ICRs/ISRs
suggest that all five are expected to achieve their developmental objectives. If confirmed
by the IEG evaluations, this will represent a significant break from the past track record
as 38% of the Jamaican projects closed since FY90 have failed to achieve their
developmental objectives.
47. With six new approvals and five exits during the CAS period, the active portfolio at
end FY09 will comprise five projects. The ISR ratings suggest satisfactory outlook for all
five projects. However, discussions with some of the implementing agencies during the
CASCR mission indicate that in some cases, the ISR ratings may be on the generous side
and may underestimate the challenges in bringing those projects to satisfactory
completion. In particular, it appears that the ICBP and the ECD projects will need
intensive supervision given their implementation experience so far and the innovative
designs of the two projects.
48. None of the projects under supervision during the CAS period has been subject to
independent QAG assessment; review of project documents and discussions with TTLs
suggest, however, good performance overall by the Bank in assisting the clients in timely
identification of problems and in providing sound professional advice to help address
those problems. The supervision efforts seem to be adequately resourced with supervision
coefficient similar to Bank wide norms. The supervision also appears to be getting
reasonable managerial oversight from the country and the sector units.
49. The main area for improvement during supervision is the quality and timeliness of
advice and assistance to clients in resolving procurement issues. Several implementing
agencies noted, besides slow response, lack of continuity in staffing of procurement
related supervision as well as inconsistencies in advice provided by the different missions
in some cases. The supervision reporting will also benefit from more carefully chosen
performance indicators as well as timely data reporting on the selected indicators. The
recent joint GOJ/Bank CPPR also rightly highlight the need for better management of
35

HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project, NCDP I, Social Safety Net Project, and DPL I.

64

Annex 5
Page 14 of 15

effectiveness delays and frequent extension of closing dates leading to delayed project
benefits. The feedback from GOJ also suggested need for further decentralization of the
Bank supervision support, especially for the fiduciary functions.
C. Country Dialogue and Aid Coordination (Moderately Satisfactory)
50. All through the CAS period the Bank enjoyed cordial relations with GOJ,
successfully overcoming the past perceptions about the Bank being an advocate of
structural adjustment through conditionality. The election of a reform-minded
government in 2007 further strengthened the Bank country dialogue leading to upgrading
of the CAS program to the high case scenario. The government counterparts appeared
generally appreciative of the advice and assistance provided by the Bank during the CAS
implementation. Also commended were the Bank’s speed and flexibility in helping
Jamaica cope with the natural disasters.
51. The Bank also did a good job during the CAS preparation in consulting a wide
spectrum of stakeholders including NGOs, Chambers of Commerce, trade unions and
academic institutions. However, the Bank was not as successful in sustaining this dialog
during the CAS implementation. For much of the CAS period, the Bank had only a
skeleton presence on the ground (single, locally recruited professional staff) and outreach
to various stakeholders was left mainly to visiting Bank missions. The situation appears
to have improved considerably following upgrading of the Bank office in March 2008.
Nevertheless, there is scope for the Bank to further intensify its engagement with these
non-governmental constituencies both to understand better their view point and
perspectives and to explain to them the logic behind the policies and programs supported
by the Bank. Worth special mention in this regard is the need to assure adequate
dissemination of the findings from the Bank’s AAA. Maintenance of a user-friendly, upto-date website should be another priority.
52. Jamaica has been a pilot country for reducing the transactions costs of development
assistance through harmonization of donor policies, programs and procedures. During the
CAS period, the Bank work proactively to harmonize its assistance with those of others,
especially IDB and EU who together with the World Bank are the three major
development partners for Jamaica. Some of the specific steps in that regard included: (a)
joint consultations with non-governmental stakeholders by IDB, DFID, CDB and WB to
inform their respective country strategies; (b) joint country fiduciary assessment by IDB
and WB to support country procurement and financial management systems agreeable to
both Banks; (c) preparation of PEFA jointly by EU and the WB to underpin a common
donor approach under the DPL; and (d) preparation of FSAP jointly by IMF and WB.
IDB and WB also designed their assistance strategies to complement each others with the
World Bank focusing on social sectors and the IDB on private sector development. The
Bank also worked closely with the IMF in analyzing and advising on the macroeconomic issues.
53. Notwithstanding the progress made to-date, there is scope for doing better
particularly through timely information sharing among donors; apparently, many donor
staff located in Jamaica would like to do that but are prevented by confidentiality rules
established by the respective HQs. Donor feedback during the CASCR mission also
65

Annex 5
Page 15 of 15

suggested that during processing of the recent DPL, the cooperation among IDB, EU and
the WB was not as good as it could have been with the three co-financiers unduly focused
on establishing the primacy of their individual contributions. The Bank should also make
efforts to strengthen its dialog and cooperation with the UN agencies in Jamaica,
especially UNICEF and FAO. To reduce aid management costs to Jamaica and to
promote greater coherence in the advice and assistance to Jamaica, the three main
partners, EU, IDB and WB may consider adopting a joint assistance strategy for Jamaica.
Shifting to the SWAp modality using country fiduciary and safeguard systems would be
another area for improving donor harmonization and aid effectiveness.
54. Without exception, both GOJ and other stakeholders were appreciative of the recent
posting by the Bank of a senior staff in Jamaica and felt that it had greatly helped in
improving the country dialogue as well as interaction among external partners.

LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE

The performance under the current CAS suggests six lessons for the future:
Be more realistic in setting targets for CAS outcomes paying due attention to the
financial and institutional constraints as well as to Jamaica’s high vulnerability to
natural hazards;
Ensure that projects are dimensioned with due regards for Jamaica’s fiscal
constraints—a successful project can always be scaled up as a repeater project or
through additional financing;
Revisit sectoral priorities to ensure that focus on social sectors is complemented by
adequate attention to growth issues. Issues of governance and corruption should be
another focal area for the future;
Strengthen supervision of procurement aspects, if possible, through decentralization
(perhaps through a mini-hub dealing with the Caribbean countries);
Ensure adequate funding for analytical and advisory work including its dissemination
and outreach; and
Further strengthen aid coordination, especially vis-à-vis IDB and EU. Consider
possibility of a joint CAS by the key partners.
