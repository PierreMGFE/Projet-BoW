REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY2010-2013
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
i.
Tajikistan has enjoyed relative political stability and strong economic growth since
its civil war ended in 1997, but these impressive gains are at risk in the face of an ongoing
global financial and economic crisis. The return to peace at home and a favorable external
environment drove average growth rates of 8.6 percent during 2000-2008, coupled with
declining inflation, fiscal surpluses, and a manageable external deficit. Since then, a recession in
Russia has brought about a substantial drop in remittances to Tajikistan which, combined with a
fall in aluminum and cotton exports, has constrained the fiscal space available to meet the
country’s development challenges. Tajikistan faces energy shortages for 5-6 months in a year
and periodically faces food security problem.
ii.
Tajikistan faces the economic crisis from a weak position. Structural reforms have
been undertaken in areas such as agriculture, energy, transport, and private and financial sector
development. However, there is a need to speed up these reforms. The country’s remote,
landlocked location, together with deteriorating infrastructure, high input costs, and weak
regulation, poses barriers to international trade, connectivity and investment. Macroeconomic
stability is fragile and government credibility was undermined by recent National Bank of
Tajikistan’s (NBT)’s misreporting of data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Though
over a million Tajik citizens have escaped poverty in recent years and social indicators have
improved, the significant drop in remittances, low agricultural productivity, and rudimentary
safety nets have left those living in or near poverty with few means to cope with shocks. Access
to services remains limited, especially in rural areas, and there is little scope for achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
iii.
The government has taken steps to address both short-term challenges and the
medium-term reform agenda. With support from the IMF, the Staff Monitored Program (SMP)
was completed in December 2008, and implementation of the subsequent Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) for 2009-2012 is on track. The ECF and other donor initiatives have also
supporting execution of the government’s May 2009 anti-crisis action plan. The government has
recognized the need to step up progress on the medium-term reform agenda in critical areas,
especially agriculture, energy, and private and financial sector development.
iv.
To unleash the potential of assets such as land, water, hydropower, and human
capital, Tajikistan will need to mitigate the effects of the crisis while working to build
capacity towards post-crisis recovery and sustained development. Addressing the near-term
challenges posed by the crisis will require sound macroeconomic management, including ECF
stabilization measures and efforts to protect spending on priority social services. An effective
crisis response will also involve actions to manage economic and social risks, including
strengthening financial sector stability, investing in human capital, and protecting the most
vulnerable segments of the population through improved social assistance. Over the mediumterm, successful post-crisis recovery will depend on enhancing the productivity of the country’s
physical and human assets. Key initiatives will include strengthening the business environment
and access to finance, boosting agricultural productivity and resolving the outstanding cotton
i

debt, improving the reliability of electricity and water supply, expanding the country’s energy
production and export potential, and enhancing human capital through higher-quality education
and health services.
v.
The World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) seeks to
address these challenges through a constructive partnership with Tajikistan’s government,
people, and donors. The CPS is anchored in the government’s own national development
priorities as expressed in the National Development Strategy (NDS) and PRS3. Recognizing the
critical importance of private sector development to Tajikistan’s future growth and poverty
alleviation goals, the CPS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank (WB) and International
Finance Corporation (IFC). The strategy has also benefited from the Bank Group’s participation
in a multi-donor effort to outline a Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS) for coordinated
donor support to Tajikistan.
vi.
Building on lessons learned, the current strategy focuses on deepening the reform
agenda launched under the previous CPS while strengthening mechanisms to foster good
governance and sustainable capacity development. The objectives of the CPS are two-fold: (i)
reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way
for post-crisis recovery and sustained development. To help achieve these two objectives and
rebuild government credibility, the Bank will work to build capacity in the context of
Tajikistan’s Country Governance and Anti Corruption (CGAC) strategy (Annex 4).
Implementation of the CPS will be guided by four principles of engagement: (i) frontloading
resources to facilitate a timely, effective crisis response; (ii) flexibility in programming given the
uncertainties surrounding the global recession; (iii) selectivity of interventions to avoid
overstretching limited capacity and resources in both the government and the Bank Group; and
(iv) leveraging the Bank Group’s global knowledge and expertise to attract co-financing.
vii.
The CPS will rely on a mix of instruments. The indicative IDA15 allocation for
Tajikistan is projected to be about US$86.6 million (SDR 55.9 million), US$30 million of which
has been used to finance the final year of the previous CPS for FY06-09. The remaining
allocation (about US$57 million) will finance the first two years of the proposed CPS. As a result
of this limited financial envelope, selectivity will be critical—within and across sectors, and
according to the Bank Group’s comparative advantage. The CPS will place greater emphasis on
budget support through a new three-year series of Programmatic Development Policy Grants
(PDPGs). The PDPG will serve to advance structural reforms needed to enhance the country’s
growth potential, while providing the fiscal space needed to maintain critical social spending.
Investment activities will rely largely on additional financing to support programs with a proven
track record and respond quickly to the crisis. New investment operations will be limited to one
to two per year. Operational design will be informed by targeted analytical work, and technical
assistance will be provided to assist the government in implementing identified reforms. The
Bank and IFC will also access various trust funds to extend the reach of the International
Development Association (IDA)-financed activities, subject to the country’s absorptive capacity
and Bank staff resources. In addition, IFC will provide direct investments to the private sector.
Tajikistan will also receive additional resource equivalent of SDR 15.4 million (about US$23.4
million) in FY10 to address the impact of the global crisis from the IDA Crisis Response
Window.
ii

viii.
Progress toward expected CPS outcomes will be monitored in the context of a
realistic and measurable results framework (Annex 1). Anticipated results are closely linked
to national strategies to demonstrate the proposed CPS program’s contribution to country
development objectives. Where possible, results indicators have been clearly defined on the basis
of monitoring exercises already being undertaken or planned by the Bank Group and other
development partners. The PDPG will support regular monitoring of a subset of CPS results, and
the remainder will be addressed through sector dialogue. Outer-year programming will be
defined through a mid-term CPS Progress Report in order to maintain program flexibility in an
uncertain environment.
ix.
The CPS supports the government in responsibly developing hydropower to secure
the country’s energy supply and gradually generate electricity export revenues. The Bank is
supporting the preparation of comprehensive techno-economical, social and environmental
assessments of a large hydropower programs such as Rogun. Subject to confirmation of the
project’s technical soundness, economic viability and compliance with all relevant
environmental and social safeguards, the Bank would consider leading the consortium to
implement the Rogun project. The Bank will work with the Government of Tajikistan and
regionally recognized institutions through a regional program on energy and water to strengthen
the technical and institutional basis for cooperation in these sectors with the aim of ensuring
mutual economic, environmental and social benefits.
x.
The CPS program has been designed in the context of strong and growing
partnerships among Tajikistan’s donors. CPS activities have been selected with other
development partners’ activities in mind, focusing on sectors where the Bank Group has a longstanding engagement, comparative advantage, and/or complementary global knowledge. These
parameters have guided the selection of agriculture, energy, private sector development, water
and sanitation, and social services as the Bank Group’s primary areas of concentration. The Bank
Group will also continue to participate in joint donor efforts to implement a recently developed
joint aid coordination strategy in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and in the
context of the ongoing JCPS for Tajikistan. Under the CPS, the Bank Group will seek to expand
collaboration with new bilateral development partners such as China and Russia, and to
strengthen engagement with Tajikistan’s parliament, civil society, and private sector.
xi.
The effectiveness of the proposed CPS program and attainment of expected
outcomes is subject to a number of risks. Implementation of the CPS could be delayed by a
protracted recession mainly in Russia, which would continue to have a chilling effect on growth
in Tajikistan. Progress in implementing the CPS program may also be slowed by weak
government commitment to deeper post-crisis reforms in productive sectors or by limited
institutional and human capacity. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and
Pakistan could result in an unprecedented influx of refugees to Tajikistan, placing additional
strain on economic and social services during a time of crisis. The CPS is designed to mitigate
these risks to the extent possible, both through its dual focus on mitigating the negative impact of
the crisis and building the foundations of post-crisis recovery, and through its principles of
engagement.

i. The following issues are proposed for Board discussion:
x

Do the Directors endorse the approach proposed in the presented CPS as appropriate
for supporting the country in meeting its short-term challenges while strengthening a
medium-term governance agenda, and build capacity to achieve medium to long term
growth?

x

Is the mix of instruments and activities consistent with the objectives, flexible
approach and feasible within the available resource envelope?

x

Does the CPS program successfully leverage the activities of other development
partners in light of limited IDA resources?

INTRODUCTION

1.
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) presents the World Bank Group’s
(WBG’s) strategy for Tajikistan during the period FY10-13. The CPS is anchored in the
government’s own national development priorities as expressed in the National Development
Strategy (NDS) and Third Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS III). To increase the effectiveness of
the Bank Group program in ensuring sustainable growth and poverty alleviation through
fostering private sector growth, the CPS has been prepared jointly by the World Bank (WB) and
International Finance Corporation (IFC). The strategy has also benefited from the Bank Group’s
participation in the ongoing development of a Joint Country Partnership Strategy (JCPS) for
coordinated donor support to Tajikistan. It was originally proposed that the CPS would be
prepared jointly with several other donors, but after an initial draft and subsequent consultation,
JCPS partners decided to focus first on the development of an aid coordination strategy,
completed in October 2009. The Bank will work with these partners to align the CPS with the
PRS III within the JCPS framework.
2.
The focus of the proposed CPS builds on the lessons learned in implementing the
Bank’s previous CPS for FY06-09 (Annex 2). The objectives of the CPS are two-fold: (i)
reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way
for post-crisis recovery and sustained development. These two objectives have a common
purpose in meeting short-term challenges and supporting a governance agenda to help build
credibility and capacity for achieving medium to long term economic growth. Efforts to improve
core governance will be mainstreamed across the CPS program in the context of Tajikistan’s
Country Governance and Anti Corruption (CGAC) strategy (Annex 4). Progress toward expected
CPS outcomes will be monitored through a realistic, measurable results framework (Annex 1),
and outer-year programming will be defined through a mid-stream CPS Progress Report (CPS
PR) in order to maintain program flexibility in an uncertain environment.
II.

COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Geography, Population and Politics
3.
Tajikistan is small, land-locked, and 93 percent mountainous, making it one of the
least accessible countries in the world. It is situated 2,000 km away from the nearest port, and
high mountains separate it from the Kyrgyz Republic in the northeast, China in the east, and
Uzbekistan in the west and north. Its 1,400 km-long southern border is shared with Afghanistan,
and the country is separated from Pakistan in the south by the narrow Wakhan corridor.
Tajikistan’s remoteness, existence of regional physical barriers together with deteriorating
Soviet-style transport infrastructure networks and weak governance and regulatory policy
frameworks, poses significant barriers to international trade, connectivity and investment.
4.
Tajikistan is vulnerable to natural disasters, external economic conditions and is the
poorest country in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region. It is regularly affected by
natural disasters such as floods, mudflows, landslides, avalanches, earthquakes, droughts and
epidemics due to its geography, topography and climate. Heavy rains in the Spring 2009 claimed
1

human lives, destroyed villages and arable land. The country is also dependent on key
commodity exports; aluminum, cotton, and labor (measured through remittances) accounted for
51.8 percent of GDP in 2008.1 Severe limitations in employment opportunities in Tajikistan have
led a large number of workers (up to 40 percent of the working population) to seek better job
prospects overseas—largely in Russia. The resulting dependence on remittances increases
vulnerability in the economy and among the Tajik population. Tajikistan’s gross national income
(GNI) per capita (Atlas method) was estimated at US$560 in 2008. Its population of 7.3 million
is young and growing rapidly, at 2 percent per year during 2000-07. A 2009 Poverty Assessment
Update indicated that households with three or more children account for 53 percent of the total
population, and 62 percent of the poor population.
5.
The country has been relatively stable since 1997, but decision-making remains
centralized and political accountability is limited. The presidency is the dominant political
institution at the national level. President Rahmon, who was elected to a second seven-year term
in 2006, is acknowledged for restoring stability after the civil conflict and presiding over a period
of strong economic growth. The President’s party (People Democratic Party) won 72 percent of
the votes in the most recent Parliamentary elections held in February 2010. Political control
remains concentrated in the center, and the parties other than the ruling party have a limited role
in the parliament. The past decade of political stability has provided some breathing space for the
government to begin making the difficult transition from a command and control system to a
modern government based on democratic principles.
6.
Tajikistan faces diverse and complex geo-political forces. The country is seen by
China, Russia, the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) as an important gatekeeper
for peace and stability in Central Asia. China’s interests in the region are based on strengthening
commercial advantages and maintaining security in border areas. Russia has a long-standing
history of involvement in Central Asia and considers maintaining its presence in the area to be
strategically important. The EU and the US are interested in preventing the spread of religious
extremism, stifling drug trafficking, and countering geo-political threats in the region.
Accordingly, the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is of increasing
concern to Tajikistan and its allies.

following the end of conflict, and a
favorable external environment.
World prices for cotton and aluminum—Tajikistan’s main export commodities—soared. Rapid
growth in Russia and other trading partners boosted demand for Tajik labor. The resulting
growth in remittances fuelled a consumption boom in Tajikistan, which helped to support
buoyant growth in real GDP during the 2000s. Inflation steadily declined reaching a single digit
during 2004-05. The country has also received considerable multilateral financing over these
years to finance its basic needs (Figure 1).
8.
Tajikistan has taken steps to improve business environment and delivery of basic
services. The new laws on business inspections and licensing have been adopted and under
implementation. The Government has made good progress with the reform of the aviation sector
by liberalizing air access, thus enhancing competition and increasing passenger turnover during
the past few years. The Tajik Airlines has also been restructured, as a result, new independent
companies have been established to transport passengers, operate airports and control air traffic.
To improve delivery of basic services, the government has gradually increased social spending
for health, education and social protection and implemented per capita financing in health and
education on a pilot basis with further scale-up at the national level. The public sector pay
system has become more transparent and the government intends to deepen the reforms in this
area.
9.
Despite the ongoing structural reform implementation, progress has been slow and
uneven. Macroeconomic management, especially fiscal policy was strengthened under the
previous PRGF when fiscal deficits were reduced substantially and domestic financing of the
budget was completely eliminated. Reforms of the sectors that represent sources of future growth
(agriculture, energy, private and financial sector development, and transport) have been
undertaken. Until recently, government’s continued intervention in agricultural production and
markets restricted the freedom of farmers to grow whatever crops that were most profitable, and
a burdensome cotton farm debt financing schemes have constrained growth in the agriculture.
Recently the government with the help of donors has resolved the longstanding cotton debts
issue and written off large parts of these debts. This is an important step towards greater farm
3

freedom and agricultural productivity in the country. Financially nonviable and poorly regulated
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector failed to secure a reliable supply of
electricity throughout the country, especially in the winter. Quality of business enabling
environment has witnessed some improvement due to reforms in legislation to simplify business
regulations and entry. This has earned the country a place among the top ten reformers and
improved its ranking in the Doing Business Report 2010. There is a need to deepen reforms to
improve the business climate and reduce the cost of doing business and minimize risks to
investors.
10.
Macroeconomic performance weakened in the mid 2000s due to an increase in
external public debt, the quasi-fiscal activities of the central bank and external shocks.
Tajikistan’s external debt position has weakened due to increased external borrowing from
bilateral creditors (particularly China) to finance large infrastructure projects, although external
public debt remains sustainable. The fiscal balance (including the public investment program,
PIP) widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008. The quasi-fiscal deficit in the energy sector, though
declining, remained high at 10 percent of GDP in 2008. The quasi-fiscal activities of the central
bank revealed that the country’s central bank, the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), had
pledged foreign exchange reserves as guarantees for foreign credits to a non-bank financial
institution for cotton financing without reporting these activities to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) as required under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) for 20022006. These developments coincided with supply side shocks that hit the country during the
period 2007-2008 through a steep rise in global fuel and food prices, and eroded the
macroeconomic indicators. The NBT’s international reserves fell below the equivalent of two
weeks of imports; the money supply nearly doubled, fueled by expansionary monetary policy
and annual average inflation accelerated to 20 percent in 2008. Trade and current account
deficits and public debt rose sharply.
11.
To restore macroeconomic stability and the credibility of the NBT and the
government, the authorities agreed with the IMF on an economic stabilization program in
April 2008. The Staff Monitored Program (SMP) aimed to rebuild foreign reserves and
strengthen governance of the NBT.2 The government has succeeded in achieving all targets
under the IMF SMP. Macroeconomic performance improved in the second half of 2008. The
economy grew by a respectable 8 percent despite reduced agricultural (cotton) and industrial
output resulting from drought, electricity shortages and decline in the world demand and prices
for key export commodities, such as aluminum and cotton. Although the spike in global food
and fuel prices in early 2008 exacerbated inflation (which reached 26 percent in June 2008), it
subsequently receded to 12 percent by end-December 2008 reflecting relatively effective
monetary policy and decline in the global commodity prices. The current account deficit declined
to 7.7 percent of GDP as a result of strong remittances inflows (47 percent of GDP), enabling the
NBT to accumulate international reserves equivalent to 1.1 months of imports (end-2008). The
overall fiscal balance (excluding externally-financed investment) remained in surplus (at 1.4

The Staff Monitored Program (SMP) measures included the implementation of a special audit of the National Bank
of Tajikistan (NBT), strengthening the autonomy and governance of the NBT through the passage of appropriate
amendments to the central bank law, and strengthening governance and monitoring of the largest state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), including through tenders for external audits of the two largest SOEs (Barki Tajik and Talco) by
reputable international firms.

percent of GDP) owing to strict expenditure control combined with buoyant revenues
(amounting to 22.1 percent of GDP) reflecting the high nominal GDP and strong import growth.
The overall fiscal deficit (including externally-financed investment) slightly declined to 5.5
percent of GDP (down from 6.1 percent 2007) reflecting disbursements of concessional external
financing for public investment projects. The stock of public debt declined to 28.9 percent of
GDP due to prudent debt policy and strict control on non-concessional borrowing (Table 1).
12.
The government adopted an anti-crisis action plan and agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) to reduce
the impact of the crisis. The anti-crisis action plan aims to protect critical social spending (e.g.,
education, health, social protection), support improved efficiency and quality of public services
through targeted increases in public sector wages, and expand employment opportunities through
social programs such as a cash-for-work scheme and measures to facilitate entrepreneurship. The
government also plans to continue implementing its civil service reform program with the
objective of improving the efficiency and the quality of public service delivery. The successful
completion of the SMP in April 2009 has paved the way for a new ECF for 2009-2012.3 The
ECF’s macroeconomic priorities include: (i) maintaining a modest fiscal deficit, excluding the
PIP; (ii) facilitating external adjustment through the exchange rate depreciation; (iii)
strengthening monetary policy and banking supervision frameworks; and (iv) building up foreign
currency reserves. The ECF’s structural reform priorities include: (i) strengthening governance
of the NBT; (ii) improving the operational and financial management of large SOEs; and (iii)
adopting a strategy to resolve cotton sector debt. Over the course of the program, the IMF is
expected to lend US$116 million, of which about US$40 million was released in May 2009 after
approval of the ECF. An additional US$40 million is expected to be disbursed in May 2010 upon
completion of the first and second reviews. To achieve the overall fiscal deficit target, the
authorities are deferring domestically-financed capital spending, continuing only with the highest
priority projects.
13.
The global economic crisis has weakened economic performance. Output growth fell
to 3.4 percent in 2009 (although higher than the original forecast of 2 percent) mainly driven by
buoyant non-cotton agricultural output. However, a significant reduction in remittances inflows
(by 31 percent) caused real per-capita disposable income to contract for the first time in many
years. Inflation receded substantially to 5 percent by end-2009. The current account deficit
declined to 7.3 percent of GDP due to lowered trade deficit (from 53 percent in 2008 to 39
percent of GDP in 2009). This was driven by lowered prices of imported fuel and food, reduced
domestic demand, and by a currency depreciation that increased export competitiveness. As a
result, the level of international reserves fell to equivalent of 1.4 months of imports in 2009. Due
to slow economic activities and the anti-crisis fiscal measures (lowered VAT and income taxes)
to stimulate private sector development, tax revenue fell by 1.1 percent of GDP (from 18.7
percent in 2008 to 17.6 percent in 2009). Budget support from development partners (WB, ADB,
and EC) amounting to US$74 million helped offsetting the impact of revenue shortfall, thus
enabling the government to increase social expenditure under the anti-crisis action plan. The
overall fiscal balance (excluding externally-financed investment) registered a deficit of 0.5
percent of GDP in 2009 and the overall fiscal deficit (including externally-financed investment)

The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility following the entry into
force of the IMF Executive Board’s decision of July 2009.

14.
However, the somoni depreciation is expected to add stress on the banking system.
The recently stress tests carried by IMF staff indicated that banks are vulnerable to a large
depreciation of the somoni because debtors with U.S. dollar-denominated loans (about 60
percent of outstanding loans) do not necessarily have foreign exchange income. To help limit the
risk of a banking crisis in Tajikistan, the authorities are strengthening the regulatory
requirements and intensifying supervision. The priorities are to improve the liquidity position of
the banks and to curb the impairment of their assets. With the support of the World Bank and the
IMF, the NBT is also drawing up contingency plans for tackling a banking crisis, so that it is not
caught unprepared should one materialize.
15.
Under the ECF program, a sound fiscal and monetary program has been agreed for
2010. The economy is expected to grow by 4 percent in 2010 due to a slow recovery of the
global economy. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding the Public Investment Program) is
projected to increase from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2009 to 1 percent of GDP in 2010. However,
this target and the associated ECF performance criteria for domestic borrowing will be
challenging due to a slowly increase in domestic revenue arising from lowered tax rates
associated with anti-crisis fiscal measures, a weaker demand for imports and domestic
6

production. With non-discretionary expenditure on wages and salaries, interest payments, and
transfers and subsidies already accounting for 65.8 percent of total budget expenditure in 2010,
further spending cuts will have to come from operations and maintenance activities, if additional
donor support is not available. The authorities have opted to defer some domestically financed
capital spending, but given the ECF target for an overall fiscal deficit, there remains a fiscal gap
between available resources and essential spending needs that is expected to be financed through
budget support grants from donors.
C. Medium-term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
16.
Tajikistan’s economic prospects are expected to improve over the medium-term,
although much depends on the positive confluence of external and domestic factors. The
protracted recession that is currently affecting Russia is expected to begin unwinding by the end
of 2010, allowing gradual recovery in Tajikistan. A recovery in demand and trade would support
Tajikistan’s exports and employment opportunities (migrant and domestic). At home, successful
implementation of the government’s anti-crisis action plan and the ECF—as well as good
progress on structural reforms to reduce supply constraints—is expected to contribute to an
economic rebound. Increased availability of employment opportunities through facilitating and
attracting investment would also help address poverty and food security concerns. Economic
recovery would depend in part on the timing, extent and focus of donor support.
17.
Output is expected to recover slowly over the medium-term. The IMF is projecting an
upturn in domestic output of 4 percent in 2010 and 5 percent on average during 2011-2013,
though substantial downside risks persist. This is supported by the implementation of structural
reforms aimed at removing the most pressing barriers to expansion of productive capacity in
agriculture, energy and the private sector as well as increased remittances and investment due to
rebounding regional growth. Prudent management of monetary and fiscal policy is expected to
keep inflation to single digits and domestic and external balances at sustainable levels. Given a
high population growth rate, a small positive growth will not be sufficient to reduce poverty.
Growth will need to accelerate to pre-crisis rates to ensure that gains in poverty reduction are not
be eroded. Debt sustainability is likely be further challenged by the absorption of cotton sector
debt and the associated need to recapitalize the NBT.
18.
Tajikistan can grow and recover over the medium-term only if it addresses the key
binding constraint to growth and utilizes its hydropower potential. A Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) prepared in 2009 found that growth is constrained by a low level of private
investment. Medium to long term growth can be achieved through hydropower production,
agriculture, small and medium businesses, infrastructure, and labor migration. Raising private
investment requires that the government: (a) improve the investment climate and protect property
rights in order to attract investment from abroad and thereby meet the large capital expenditure
requirements of large investment projects, (b) shift resource away from cotton to food crops and
fodder crops for livestock through the removal of restrictions on the “freedom to farm”, the
liberalization of land use and agricultural input and output markets, and carefully planned
support services for farmers and livestock producers, and (c) alleviate key bottlenecks such as
unreliable power supply through institutional and governance reforms to improve generation and
distribution systems in the energy sector and increasing tariffs to cost recovery levels. These
7

actions would be facilitated by efforts to strengthen governance, transparency, and accountability
in Tajikistan.
19.
Debt sustainability remains at risk. In recent years, the government has borrowed
increasingly from bilateral creditors, mainly to finance infrastructure projects that aim to support
economic growth over the medium-term. Most of the debt stock growth in 2008 resulted from
the disbursement of loans from China (over 5 percent of GDP) to finance roads and energy
projects (power transmission lines). Though the ratio of private and public sector external debt to
GDP improved from 53.6 percent in 2005 to 47.3 percent in 2008,4 the joint IMF-WB debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted in February 2009 shows that Tajikistan’s risk of debt
distress remains high; this is also confirmed by a recent DAS update.5 The deterioration of
macroeconomic indicators such as growth and export demand is likely to cause the net present
value of debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-exports indicators to breach policy thresholds.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that debt sustainability is vulnerable to adverse
macroeconomic shocks such as lower GDP, declining export growth, real exchange rate
depreciation, non-concessional borrowing and even an additional debt on concessional terms.
This underscores the need for the government to exercise extreme caution in incurring new debt,
to carefully vet large-scale investment projects, and to ensure efficient utilization of external
resources. Sound macroeconomic policies and acceleration of structural reforms would also be
essential to maintain debt sustainability by enhancing growth potential and safeguarding external
stability.

Including noticeable improvement in the PPG debt to GDP ratio from 38.8 percent in 2005 to 28.9 percent in 2008.
The recent IMF update of the DSA (April 2010), shows that debt ratios for external debt look significantly better
when remittances included into the denominators of the modified debt burden ratios. The vulnerability indicators are
substantially lower than previously assessed and remain below their respective thresholds. However, this does not
change Tajikistan’s high risk rating, which is based on indicators without accounting for remittances inflows. Debtto-export ratio significantly exceeds the threshold throughout the projected period, and debt-to-GDP ratio breaches
the threshold during 2014-2019, albeit marginally.

This is the expected reduction in poverty between 2003 and 2007 as estimated by the WB using the 2003-2007
economic growth rate (in per capita terms) applied to the 2003 household survey data. Alternatively, based on the
absolute poverty line derived from the 2007 TLSS, the poverty headcount declined from 72 percent in 2003 to 54
percent in 2007.

live in rural areas) escaped poverty in recent years, though about 2.9 million remain poor (Table
2). The incidence of extreme poverty7 declined from 42.1 percent in 2003 to 17.3 percent in
2007, dropping more rapidly in rural areas. The strong growth in remittances between 2003 and
2007 accounts for about half of the observed reduction in poverty.8 Poverty is mainly a rural
phenomenon in Tajikistan, with the rural poor accounting for 75 percent of all poor and 72
percent of the extreme poor (Box 1).
Box 1: Poverty in Tajikistan
Poverty in Tajikistan is largely a story of the working poor in the rural sector. Though employment—especially
in non-agriculture sectors—does reduce the risk of poverty, 58 percent of poor people in Tajikistan live in households
where the household head is employed. Rural areas account for nearly 80 percent of the working poor, as
employment is concentrated in agriculture and related activities. Other characteristics of poor households include
three or more children, household heads with limited education, landlessness or ownership of small plots in rural
areas, and location at high altitudes.
Many households in Tajikistan send workers abroad as a poverty-coping strategy. About 25 percent of
households participating in the 2007 TLSS included a migrant worker who was abroad or had returned in the past
year. Employment abroad does reduce the risk of poverty, as the total and extreme poverty headcounts (using a costof-basic-needs approach) among households with over 20 percent migrant workers were 43 percent and 13 percent,
respectively, as compared to 54 percent and 17 percent among households with fewer migrant workers.
Yet Tajikistan’s dependence on remittances is a source of considerable vulnerability. Scenario analysis based on
TLSS data suggests that a 30 percent decline in remittances would increase the national poverty rate by 6 percentage
points and inequality by 3 percentage points. This effect would be expected to be stronger in rural areas due to the
higher concentration of migrant workers in those areas.
Non-income dimensions of poverty show limited progress. Pressure on public service delivery grew significantly
after independence due to rapid population growth and reduced public spending. As a result, infrastructure is of poor
quality; access to electricity, heating, and safe drinking water is limited; and unofficial payments for services are high
and prevalent. The social protection system is rudimentary, dominated by old-age and disability pensions with
virtually no social assistance. Together, these factors have constrained access to education and health services,
especially for the poorest of the poor in rural areas.
Food security remains a concern. Food insecurity is high among the extreme poor and worsens between late winter
and early spring. Common coping strategies include reducing the number of meals to two or fewer per day and
altering the nature of food consumed. As a result, the poorest quintile of the population consumes fewer than 2,000
calories per person per day on average.

21.
The decline in some social indicators has improved. Social indicators such as school
enrollment, infant mortality, and child mortality were poor at the end of the 1990s, as a
consequence of the post-independence civil conflict, weak governance and deterioration of
public services. As peace and stability took hold, the environment became conducive to the
implementation of structural reforms, increased public expenditure, and strengthened social
sector management. In time, indicators began to reflect these improvements. School enrollment

Extreme poverty refers to food poverty. It reflects the cost of a typical food basket needed to consume 2,250
calories per person per day with typical needs. The value of this extreme poverty line is equivalent to 89 somoni per
month at end-2007 prices.

rates increased at all levels of education between 2000 and 2006.9 The primary completion rate
rose from 95 percent in 2000 to 99 percent in 2005. Improved maternal health services,
combined with a reduction in poverty, contributed to a significant decline in infant mortality
(from 75 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 56 in 2007). Similarly, child mortality declined from 93
to 68 per 1,000 live births. Gender equality improved, with the ratio of girls to boys enrolled in
primary school rising from 93 in 2000 to 95 in 2007.
22.
Despite this important progress, it is unlikely that Tajikistan will achieve its
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The indicators related to infant mortality
(per 1,000 live births), under-five mortality (per 1,000 live births), and maternal mortality (per
100,000 live births) stand at 56, 68, and 97, compared to the 2015 MDG targets of 25, 30, and
30, respectively. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS has been increasing, and the
use of contraception and knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention remains limited. The percentage of
the rural population with access to safe water stood at 55 percent in 2007, compared to a target of
74 percent by 2015. The reasons for this have much to do with the limited financial, institutional,
and human resources available to the country to adequately address its basic social challenges.
Social sector expenditure remains lower than those prevailing in other Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) countries due to budget constraints. Despite efforts to improve its
social sector, the quality of education and health services remains below Soviet-era levels. A
large proportion of the population still has only limited access to basic services. The social safety
net system that was established to protect the vulnerable, including the unemployed, is
rudimentary.
E. Governance
23.
Development in Tajikistan depends on improvements in the governance. The civil
war took a heavy toll on Tajikistan’s institutional and human capacity. Efforts to rebuild that
capacity are impeded by specifics of the country’s political economy and limited financial
resources to upgrade institutions and retrain workers with outdated technical skills to properly
manage the transition to a market economy. Capacity limitations constrain the government’s
effectiveness in designing and implementing programs to achieve priority development
objectives. In addition, the political arrangements between the national and sub-national
government that are required to keep peace appear to limit the scope of governance reforms.
24.
The government’s effectiveness needs to be increased at both national and sector
levels. During the last CPS period, political interference, weak capacity, and lack of transparent
institutional arrangements in Tajikistan contributed to critical domestic policy slippages. Uneven
progress has been achieved in: (a) resolving long-standing rural reforms,10 (b) effectively
managing macroeconomic policy, (c) addressing successive energy and food price crises, and (d)
inspiring confidence in dealing with the impact of the global economic crisis on the Tajik
economy. The disruption in energy supplies during the severe winter of 2008 further highlighted
9

According to the TLSS, gross pre-primary enrollment increased from 73 to 91 percent, net primary enrollment
from 96 to 97 percent, net secondary enrollment from 71 to 80 percent, and gross tertiary enrollment from 14 to 18
percent.
10
These rural reforms include land restructuring, resolution of the cotton farm debt, freedom-to-farm initiatives, and
reduction of state interventions in cotton production and marketing.

10

the government’s inability to overcome low capacity and weak corporate governance among
state-owned energy enterprises (especially Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgaz). Increasingly viewed
as having limited capacity to manage crises, the government’s effectiveness in managing
conventional economic duties is also in question as a result of the misuse of public funds
(discovered to have been kept completely off-budget) and the belated admission of misreporting
to the IMF in 2007.
25.
Work is underway to strengthen public financial management (PFM) and public
sector performance in Tajikistan. PFM reforms initiated over the last decade have begun to
bear fruit, including the introduction of a partially automated Treasury system, development of a
new budget classification system, efforts to strengthen planning and resource allocation in the
social sectors, and promulgation of a new procurement law. To strengthen public sector
performance more broadly, the government streamlined the structure of central public
administration to eliminate excessive fragmentation of institutions, clarify mandates, and
strengthen institutional capacity. Civil service reforms have been initiated, including efforts to
introduce competitive recruitment and pay linked to job descriptions. A functional review of the
administration and delivery of social services has led to the amendment of key legislation and
institutional improvements in priority sectors (e.g., streamlining education service delivery and
financing, piloting patient fees in health care institutions, introducing policy-based budgeting).
Service delivery standards have been designed and institutional changes needed to improve the
quality of social services have been initiated.
26.
However, public finance management system needs to be strengthened and
transparency and accountability improved to avoid potential risks to public funds. A 2007
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment indicated that the budget
process remains fragmented and there are substantial deviations between budget allocations and
execution, both in amount and composition. Tracking and control of commitments are not well
linked to the procurement function. In March 2007, the government adopted a strategy for
improving internal control and established pilot internal audit units in a number of line
ministries. Yet internal audit remains weak, focusing more on individual transactions than on
systemic issues and effectiveness of public resource use. Development of legal and institutional
structures that will support the establishment of an independent external audit institute is
ongoing. Accounting does not comply with international standards and is still done manually at
all levels except the central treasury, though basic systems of accounting, recording and
reporting are in place. There is still no reliable, modern financial management information
system to ensure quality and reliability in reporting. In an effort to address these concerns, the
government of Tajikistan adopted a comprehensive PFM Reform Strategy for 2009-18 in March
2009 and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has prepared a more targeted Action Plan for 2009-11.
27.
Cross-country indicators show that tackling governance problems in Tajikistan
must become a priority. Tajikistan has recently improved on the ease of doing business (DB),
according to the joint World Bank Group Doing Business 2010 survey (paragraph 40) and was
among the top 10 world reformers. However, the country’s ranking remains low at 152nd out of
183 countries, as compared to the LIC average of 141. The quality of public administration, as
measured in the 2008 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), is stable at 2.5 (out
of 6) as compared to the average among IDA borrowers of 2.9. At the same time, the 2008
World Governance Indicators rank Tajikistan in the bottom 15 percent of countries on voice and
11

accountability, rule of law, and control of corruption, significantly below ECA and LIC averages
(Figure 2).

TAJIKISTAN’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND PRIORITIES

A. National Development Agenda
28.
In 2005, Tajikistan adopted the NDS for 2006-2015. The NDS aims to support the
creation of a democratic and prosperous state where the benefits of political and economic
development are available to the population as a whole. Key priorities include improving public
administration, developing the private sector and attracting investment, and developing human
potential.
29.
A follow-up PRS III for 2010-2012 presented a medium-term program to implement
the NDS vision, building on the lessons learned under PRS II. It builds on the overarching
objective and strategic building blocks of the PRS II. The PRS III’s overarching objective is to
promote sustainable improvements in living standards, particularly of vulnerable groups. It
maintains the three strategic programming blocks spelled out in the PRS II: (i) a functional block
on public administration reform, macroeconomics, investment climate, private sector, regional
cooperation and global economic integration; (ii) a production block on food security,
agriculture, infrastructure, energy and industry; and (iii) a social block on health, education,
water and sanitation, housing, and social welfare. It recognizes several crosscutting issues,
including institutional reforms, demographic change, environmental management, and gender
equality.
12

30.
The PRS III updates key reforms to support economic growth and poverty
reduction. Measures to improve governance in public administration and SOEs include reducing
corruption at all levels of government, strengthening public procurement and financial
management systems, and reducing involvement of the state in economic activities in order to
promote private sector development. Strengthening Tajikistan’s investment climate is seen as the
key to stimulating growth, and the PRS III aims to achieve this goal by simplifying complex and
non-transparent business regulations, strengthening property rights, and improving infrastructure
services. Under the PRS III, the government plans to increase public spending on education and
health in order to promote attainment of the MDGs. Financing reforms aim to improve the
efficiency and equity of public spending, while structural reforms (targeting institutions, human
resource management, and infrastructure) are expected to improve the quality of and access to
public services over the medium- to long-term.
31.
The PRS III reflects lessons learned from implementation of the PRS II. It presents a
comprehensive description of how poverty analysis and monitoring will be strengthened over
time. It responds to the need for post-crisis recovery and growth and outlines the measures being
taken to accelerate structural reforms, including securing property rights and enhancing the
business environment. It also discusses actions to improve public sector governance and public
sector management, especially through reform of the public administration and pay system. The
PRS II presents a clear process for costing, prioritizing and sequencing interventions, and aims to
enhance the coordination of development partner support. Therefore, it is better prioritized by
focusing on the energy sector and sustainable agricultural development.
32.
The Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) suggests areas of improvement and notes that
PRS III program remains ambitious in light of unidentified financing sources. The JSAN
suggests that the PRS III specify the priority programs that promote rural livelihoods and
improve access of the poor to social services, thus reducing poverty. To ensure sustained
economic growth over the medium-term, the PRS III should deepen structural reforms to
improve the business climate and strengthen property rights. The JSAN notes that the energy
sector strategy should provide an integrated framework that links energy development challenges
with other critical poverty and growth challenges. It suggests that the government continued
focus on human capital development to build on the gains of the past decade, improve
mechanisms to protect vulnerable groups, and strengthen governance to ensure that resources are
used to achieve lasting development results. Finally, the staffs recommend that the authorities
either need to identify additional financing sources for their ambitious program or reprioritize
further across different objectives.
33.
The PRS III provides an adequate framework for CPS support. The ongoing global
financial crisis has prompted the government to better prioritize the agenda in the context of an
anti-crisis action plan. The plan aims to reinforce macroeconomic stability, maintain delivery of
essential public services, and address vulnerabilities faced by the population. This action plan,
combined with the unfinished PRS II agenda, form the basis for the PRS III. The CPS aligns its
strategic objectives with those of the PRS III and will support the implementation of this action
plan, monitoring the process and adjusting support as needed. IDA will focus on areas where it
has a comparative advantage, complements activities carried out by other development partners,
or involvement is requested by the government.

B. Key Economic and Social Priorities
34.
Tajikistan faces the economic crisis from a weak position, but amid the significant
challenges ahead lie important opportunities to advance the development agenda during
the next CPS period. In order to unleash the potential of key assets such as land, water, and
human capital, Tajikistan needs to deepen structural reforms and spur much needed private
investment. As discussed above, however, the fiscal space available for such reforms is limited
in the wake of falling remittances and revenues, and an increasing public debt burden.
Macroeconomic management capacity is limited, and government credibility has suffered in the
wake of governance missteps such as the NBT’s misreporting of data to the IMF. In this context,
the government will need to refocus its efforts on addressing critical near-term challenges:
mitigating the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability, and reducing the
medium-term constraints to reaping the full benefits of a sustainable post-crisis recovery.
i.

Reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability

35.
Building on its anti-crisis action plan, the government formulated a program for
immediate economic stabilization and rationalization of public expenditure in April 2009.11
Maintaining prudent monetary and fiscal policies will be essential for macroeconomic stability,
and these efforts will be guided by the macroeconomic framework agreed with the IMF under
the ECF arrangement. Monetary policy will aim to maintain a competitive exchange rate and
stabilize inflation to offer greater incentives for private investment. In particular, the authorities
have committed to a flexible exchange rate while aiming to rebuild international reserves. On the
fiscal side, while still committed to the deficit target of 0.5 percent of GDP, the government
revised its budget in May 2009 to reflect downgraded revenue estimates. The revised budget
followed three main principles: (i) ring-fencing social expenditure to maintain delivery of key
public services such as education and health; (ii) prioritizing social assistance to vulnerable
groups; and (iii) scaling back non-essential expenditure items including operation and
maintenance spending. The capital spending on the rehabilitation of the construction site of a
large hydropower plant at Rogun has been kept at the original budget level (US$120 million) as
it is considered a strategic development priority to achieve energy independence and provide a
basis for growth and develop regional trade through hydroenergy exports within Central Asia
and with South Asia.12 Given that revenue collections and funding for budget support were better
than expected, the macro-fiscal targets agreed with the IMF were met nearly fully with a small
deficit in 2009.
36.
To ensure continued delivery of basic public services necessary for the poor during
the crisis, the government is committed to protect social spending. As agreed with the IMF,
the ECF program includes an indicative target on the level of social spending. Towards this end,
budgetary allocation for the education and health sectors were kept at the same level as that of
2008. This ensured that provisioning of public services by schools and health facilities are

The hydropower plant at Rogun was started during Soviet times in the 1980s, but construction stalled in the early
1990s due to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Tajik civil war. In 1993, the half-finished works were severely
damaged by a major flood, causing serious loss of built assets. Since 2008, the government has been financing
construction activities to restore the site to its pre-1993 status.

14

sustained during the crisis. Education and health personnel can continue serving the population
as sufficient budgetary funds will be allocated for wages and salaries as well as some relevant
recurrent expenditure. The government also agreed to track these expenditures and monitor their
performance through the introduction of a Virtual Poverty Fund (VPF) with assistance from
donors. However, actual spending on the social sectors increased in 2009 (43.6 percent of the
total state budget excluding PIP and extra-budgetary fund, as compared to approved spending of
42 percent). The 2010 budget envisages an increase in social expenditures due in part to
increased public sector wage for education and health personnel.
37.
The government plans to strengthen the social protection system to reduce the
vulnerability of the poor to future domestic and external shocks. Though poor people are
especially at risk during social downturns, the social protection measures currently in place in
Tajikistan are not adequate for effective crisis response as they are inefficiently designed,
targeted, and administered. Implementation is fragmented and institutional capacity is limited.
The anti-crisis program provides a small fiscal stimulus to generate employment, including
priority measures such as unemployment benefits, skills training, micro-credit, and public works
programs. Those unable to find employment following training can receive employment benefits
for up to six months provided they have a recent employment history. Public works programs
include mainly mini-hydropower and small road maintenance projects. The government is also
working with donors to scale up food programs and to provide high quality wheat seeds and
fertilizer to farmers in order to mitigate food insecurity. Quarterly surveys indicate that the
economic crisis, coupled with recent increases in food prices, has had a visible impact on rural
households in Tajikistan.13 More unemployment, fewer remittances, and even bankruptcies of
small businesses have reduced access to food. Finally, the government is working with the
European Commission (EC) and IDA to develop a social protection strategy encompassing: (i) a
labor market and migrant strategy; (ii) targeting of social benefits and privileges; (iii) expansion
and physical upgrading of care institutions; and (iv) capacity building in relevant public
institutions.
38.
The anti-crisis action plan aims to maintain the stability of the financial system by
reducing its vulnerability to further deterioration of economic fundamentals. While
Tajikistan's financial sector, primarily commercial banks, has not been affected directly by the
global financial crisis, it has become more vulnerable on account of indirect linkages (for
example, through trade credits). First, there has been an increase in the number of nonperforming loans to cotton farmers,14 impairing banks’ asset quality and lowering their capital
and liquidity. Widespread loan defaults could turn into a banking crisis given low capital levels
at the NBT, which limits its ability to implement effective monetary policy. Second, the rate of
growth of foreign and local currency deposits have declined due to the slowdown in remittances
and lower deposits from large corporate clients such as the Tajik Aluminum Company
13

September 2009.
14
In 2008, the government extended TJS 140 million (US$41 million) to selected commercial banks to on-lend to
cotton farmers at capped interest rates (the credit represented 17 percent of total outstanding loans in 2008), with the
banks bearing the credit risk. In 2009, the government allocated another TJS 180 million (US$40 million) to the
cotton sector. However, the cotton sector historically has a poor repayment record due to poor governance, which is
now being exacerbated by lowered world demand and falling cotton prices.

(TALCO). A number of banks have experienced liquidity problems and have used the NBT’s
liquidity facility (with a lending volume of about Tajik somoni (TJS) 2 million (US$0.4 million)
for up to three months). Finally, a high degree of dollarization15 has increased the banking
system’s vulnerability to somoni depreciation, as many businesses that have borrowed in dollars
have local currency revenues. To address these issues, the NBT has intensified banking
supervision and developed contingency plans to deal with a potential collapse in confidence.
39.
The NBT’s internal transparency, accountability, and banking supervision capacity
will be improved to maintain the public’s confidence in the banking system. In December
2008, the NBT ceased its financing of the cotton sector and abolished cotton export licenses. In
June 2009, the NBT approved an action plan in response to the findings of the special audit
carried out under the SMP, and posted it on its webpage. During May-August 2009, with
technical assistance (TA) from the WB, amendments to the Law on the National Bank of
Tajikistan and a new Law on Banking Activities were passed by Parliament and signed into law
by the President. The amended laws prohibit the NBT from engaging in direct lending,
strengthen the independence of the Board of Directors, and will lead to stronger and more
predictable supervision of banks. The NBT will require banks to apply modern governance and
transparency principles, including the obligation to disclose beneficial shareholders. The role of
the NBT’s internal audit function is also being strengthened.
ii.

Reducing constraints to a post-crisis recovery and sustained economic growth

40.
To achieve a post-crisis recovery and sustained growth, Tajikistan needs to expand
the productive capacity of physical assets including land, water, and human capital. Strong
growth during the past decade has pushed Tajikistan close to its production possibility frontier.
Without expanding this boundary, a post-crisis economic recovery may not be sustained over the
medium-term. The solution is to reduce constraints to growth, an undertaking that will require
Tajikistan to renew its commitment to deepening structural reforms that have been initiated.
Private investment will follow once improvements have taken hold in the business environment
at both the macroeconomic and business levels. The productive capacity of arable land, water,
and labor—the main sources of growth in Tajikistan—must be significantly enhanced to increase
the benefit from the country’s comparative advantages. Fortunately, the country’s water
resources can be harnessed to provide hydropower for domestic use and for export to rapidly
growing neighboring economies (such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Kyrgyz Republic and
Uzbekistan). Human capital must not only be preserved but also enhanced in order to supply the
private sector with healthy and skilled workers.
41.
A sound business environment will stimulate the private investment necessary to
sustain growth over the medium term. The government has recently taken steps to improve
business and investment climate, as reflected in its place among the world’s top ten reforming
countries in Doing Business 2010.16 In July 2008, a presidential decree placed a two-year
15

At end-2008, deposits and loans denominated in dollars accounted for 67 and 56 percent of total deposits and
loans of Tajik commercial banks.
16
Tajikistan ranked 152 out of 183 countries in the Doing Business 2010, up from 159 out of 181 countries in the
2009 survey. Areas of concern include starting a business (143rd dealing with construction permits (177th), getting
credit (176th), paying taxes (162nd), and trading across borders (179th). See: Doing Business 2010: Reforming
through Difficult Times.

16

moratorium on inspections regulating SMEs, with some exceptions. In July 2009 the government
launched the “200 days of reform” program, with the aim of improving the business environment
and making the country more attractive to investors. With support from the EC, the government
has introduced One-Stop Shop in 50 out of 68 tax inspectorates to simplify business registration
process. The inadequate protection of property rights and inconsistent application of laws and
regulations discourage private investment in Tajikistan. It should be noted that some external
factors beyond the government’s control also hinder trade and growth in Tajikistan including
difficulties in importing electricity and transit of goods through neighboring countries. Costs are
high due to the unreliable supply of electricity, fragmented and poorly maintained infrastructure,
time-consuming customs procedures, and labor skill shortages in some sectors. The cost of doing
business is further increased by corruption and bribery. As a result of the poor investment
climate combined with a low level of migrants’ income, remittances—a major source of
incoming finance in Tajikistan—are generally spent on consumption or real estate rather than on
private sector investment.
42.
Private sector growth and investment would also benefit from increased access to
finance at a lower cost. Tajikistan’s financial system is underdeveloped and has limited capacity
to serve the investment needs of business. Weak governance, low transparency, and poor service
quality in banks lower public confidence and limit deposits, thus raising the cost of funding. The
legal framework is inadequate, and the capacity to implement and enforce applicable laws is
weak. Legal and institutional arrangements for secured lending are particularly problematic,
restricting the range of collateral that can be used to secure loans. The availability of diverse
financial products and services catering to specific business needs is limited, especially in rural
areas. Further, high interest rate spreads, short loan duration, widespread reliance on
insider/related lending, and low branch density discourage the private sector from seeking
financing from the banking sector. The insurance sector is undeveloped and operates within a
weak regulatory and supervisory framework. To address some of these weaknesses, the
government has begun to implement the recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) with support from the Bank Group and IMF. Measures undertaken include
adoption of new legislation and development of a financial sector strategy.
43.
Agriculture reform will be critical to enhancing Tajikistan’s productive capacity
and reducing poverty in rural areas. Good progress has been made in wheat production
following the government’s use of IDA support to import and supply drought-tolerant and rustresistant varieties of wheat seeds to compensate for the limited capacity of the domestic seed
industry. Recently, the government has taken concrete actions to reduce its intervention in
production as well as to resolve the cotton farm debt that hinders agricultural growth. In the
wake of the crisis, the government has been working steadily with donors to develop a broadbased reform program and measures to remove policy distortions, strengthen land rights, and
increase competition among ginneries and investors. A Presidential Decree for cotton debt
resolution was promulgated and a government resolution and an action plan to resolve the cotton
debt and reform the agriculture sector was approved (Box 2). The action plan will serve as the
platform for developing and implementing agrarian reforms to ensure freedom to farm,
accelerate efforts to ensure proper land titling, improve farmers’ access to finance and collateral
practices, and increase returns to farmers and cotton sector recovery. The government is also
committed to supporting sustainable agricultural development in the non-cotton sub-sector,
including irrigation and drainage infrastructure and institutions, rural finance services, and farm
17

input markets. This is because non-cotton sector products from household plots, especially staple
food commodities (cereals, meat, milk, vegetables, and potatoes) have recently emerged as a
main driver of agricultural growth for the immediate future. They are relatively low cost
commodities to produce, have significant potential to raise the current level of productivity, and
can be readily sold in domestic markets. Going forward, the Bank will support the government in
the implementation of the action plan together with the strategy to strengthen the non-cotton subsector.
44.
The government is planning to take on a new agenda to strengthen natural disaster
risk management, weather forecasting, and climate change adaptation to reduce
vulnerability and thus increase agricultural output. Because of its geography, topography and
climate, Tajikistan is regularly affected by natural disasters such as floods, mudflows, landslides,
avalanches, earthquakes, droughts and epidemics. Climate change is expected to exacerbate
natural disasters associated with hydro-meteorological conditions, with associated damages
affecting the rural economy disproportionately. The government recognizes that reducing
environmental disaster risks is key to mitigating macroeconomic risks and improving welfare.

18

Box 2: Progress in Addressing Constraints to Expanding Agricultural Capacity in Tajikistan
The agriculture sector is composed of two sub-sectors, each of which is regulated by its own policy framework.
The cotton sector accounts for 65 percent of arable land and 75 percent of irrigated arable land but only about 9 percent
of agriculture value added. The policy framework for the non-cotton sector is more open, but government support is
minimal. Recent trends are instructive: the cotton sector has performed poorly and cotton producers are the poorest and
most food-insecure people in rural areas, while the non-cotton sector has grown steadily. The government is working to
expand agricultural capacity by resolving the cotton farm debt, reducing government intervention, encouraging financing
decision by farmers, and improving the security of land tenure.
The government is actively implementing policy reform to address the underlying structural problems in the
cotton sector. A small group of powerful cotton financiers had required farmers’ to provide raw cotton at low prices in
return for financing. Local government authorities facilitated this system by coercing farmers to grow cotton rather than
other crops, and by minimizing the competition faced by favored cotton investors. The local and regional monopsonies
thus created have stifled competition in the sector, decreased farm profitability, reduced producer incentives to raise
output, inhibited the growth of alternative sources of rural finance, and slowed the development of alternative markets for
farm inputs and cotton output. As a result, cotton production has declined markedly since 2004, and returns to farmers
have fallen. Overdue (internal) farmer debt to investors has grown to an alleged US$ 435 million. The government’s
attempt to sustain this system by facilitating investor access to external credit through the NBT has undermined the
external debt sustainability. The government and donors are working steadily to remove policy distortions, strengthen
land rights, and increase competition among ginneries and investors - as the basis for increasing returns to farmers and
fostering cotton sector recovery.
The farm debt write-off will enable farmers to borrow from commercial banks as they would no longer be
indebted to investors. In line with the commitments made under the IMF’s new Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
program, the government has recently approved an action plan to write off the debt owed by farmers to cotton ginneries
(“investors”) and commercial banks.. Investors who obtained finance through the government-backed scheme will be
obliged to take this loss in full. Non-cotton loans made by investors will be repaid to the NBT at concessional rates. The
farm debt owed by farmers to cotton ginneries (“investors”) and commercial banks will be assumed by the government
after debt-restructuring.. Within the next six months each individual farmer will be issued a certificate that states that he
is free from any debt.
The disclosure of the IMF misreporting sheds light on the unsustainability of existing state financing of the cotton
sector, underscoring the need for alternative financing mechanisms. The NBT ceased to fund private sector cotton
investors in 2008, and cotton export licensing was abolished. The government introduced a temporary and ad hoc cotton
financing mechanism through which it extends domestic credit financed by the budget to commercial banks to on-lend to
cotton farmers. These credits amounted to 140 and 180 million somoni in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The new
mechanism raises concerns about fiscal burden and risk to the banking system, so the government with donor support is
now implementing a private financing mechanism through which commercial banks extend credit to farmers based on
their profitability (Tajikistan’s Agricultural Finance Facility) as supported by EBRD and the Bank Group.
The government’s cotton sector interventions have declined gradually and competition has increased. The
government traditionally intervened in agricultural production by enforcing cotton production targets and confiscating
land that was used “irrationally.” These restrictions made it difficult for farmers to switch production out of cotton into
more profitable agricultural activities, thus inhibiting agricultural growth. In response, has begun implementing a Cotton
Farm Debt Resolution and Action Plan (Decree 111 and Decree 312) to assure the right of farmers to use their land as
they choose (“freedom to farm”) and has established open competition among the processors and exporters who buy the
harvest. Competition has increased, with the market share of the largest five cotton investors falling dramatically and 75
investors exporting about 60 percent of cotton fiber. A 2009 farm survey found that local government intervention in
cropping decisions has decreased steadily, especially in the Khatlon region.
Land certificates are being issued at a faster pace to increase farmers’ access to land. Since the beginning of 2009,
the number of properly registered collective dehqon farms has grown to 41,093, almost double the number in 2005
(23,322). Land use choices are still constrained, however, as is the transfer of land through sale. Lease and mortgage
practices are underdeveloped and convoluted. Together, these factors prevent farmers from choosing crops based on
market forces and managing land sustainably. Farm restructuring is needed to strengthen farmer independence, but this
has been delayed by political and technical constraints, especially in cotton-growing areas.

19

45.
Improving energy sector performance is a priority for sustainable economic growth.
Tajikistan’s hydropower potential is estimated at about 140 GW with an annual generation
capacity of 527 TWh, of which only 5 percent is developed. The country’s domestic energy
consumption is therefore met quasi totally by hydropower which represents 97 percent of the
electricity production. About one-third of the electricity is consumed by the aluminum company
TALCO, which has key importance for socio-economic development of the country. The energy
infrastructure inherited from the Soviet era is deteriorating rapidly and costly to maintain. Low
tariffs and blanket subsidization of power prices contribute to waste of electricity and fail even to
cover operation and maintenance costs further contributing to the deterioration of the antiquated
assets. Moreover, the energy system is also affected by high technical losses. Corporate
governance among energy SOEs (Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas) has improved in the last few
years but remains weak due to low institutional capacity and by slow progress in improving
transparency and accountability in financial management and operation.
46.
The increased dependence on hydropower after the breakup of the Soviet Union led
to increased vulnerability of the system owing to the seasonal variability of water flows.
Tajik authorities estimated that generation deficit during winter months is in the range of 2.5 to 3
TWh (about 20 to 23 percent of the total electricity consumption in 2008) and the generation in
excess of domestic demand in the summer is about 2.5 TWh because reservoirs are managed to
meet irrigation needs of downstream neighbors, according to water sharing agreements dating
back to the Soviet era. The country faced severe energy shortages during the past few years due
to the collapse of the previous working mechanism for water and energy exchange. The recent
disconnection of the Tajik power system from the Central Asia Power System (CAPS) will likely
increase the vulnerability of the fragile and now weakened power system.
47.
The 2007 power sector strategy developed by the Government of Tajikistan aims to
ensure reliable electricity supply to meet the needs of the population and productive sectors
to sustain growth and contribute to poverty reduction. The target is to become self-reliant by
the year 2017 and gradually develop power exports and strengthen regional cooperation to
increase electricity export revenues and generate a new source of growth. The three pronged
strategy focuses on:
x

Reducing energy waste and rationalizing demand. Actions taken to date include
significant tariff increases (an increase of about 250 percent from 2007 to late 2009) –
even though sales prices remain well below costs of supply. Under the First Phase of the
Energy Loss Reduction Project the following works have been performed: installation of
electric meters, cabling, the replacement of transformers which resulted in significant
increase of payments, and implementation of some measures to optimize and increase
functionality of Dushanbe distribution network. There has also been extensive
deployment of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to reduce lighting peak loads.

x

Rehabilitating and modernizing existing assets to increase electricity supply. After the
completion of the Sangtuda I and II, several small hydropower plants are being
constructed and planned, the rehabilitation of key hydropower facilities built during the
Soviet era are being evaluated, and the rehabilitation of the underground work of the
Rogun hydropower plant has been initiated.
20

x

Attracting private and donor funding to develop hydropower and regional transmission
infrastructure to develop export markets and generate stable revenues that would
contribute sustained growth.

x

Prioritizing construction of transmission lines for their connection to the national grid
(about 300 km), including PTL 500 kV Dushanbe–Sangtuda I, enhancing the national
dispatch center with SCADA, and construction of PTL 220 kV Khujand-Aini with
substations.

48.
Rehabilitation of Rogun Hydro Power Plant has resumed since 2008. The
construction of the Rogun HPP is of the highest strategic importance to address Tajikistan’s
energy deficit and thus lay the foundation for future growth and poverty reduction through
employment generation. Work on the project, which was initiated in 1983 and substantially
damaged by a flood in 1993, was resumed in 2008 with a view to rehabilitate the project site to
its pre-1993 status and to commission the first two turbines by 2014. The government has
recently established Rogun Open Joint Stock Company (Rogun OJSC) with an authorized capital
of SM 6 billion that will be state owned for 75 percent. The remaining 25 percent of the shares
(SM 1.5 billion) is currently being sold to the public that so far has contributed SM 800 million
(USD 180 million). The government’s share will be paid for by budget transfers throughout the
construction contingent to the preparation of a sound financial plan. Recently, the government
has reached an agreement with the IMF in the context of the ongoing ECF to suspend public
campaign for share sale to the population. Further share sale will be reassessed against the
financing options of the country and the outcome of the WB economic and social and
environmental studies. To ensure full transparency and a strong governance structure for the
Rogun project, the government is planning to set up a supervisory board to oversee all financial
aspects of the Rogun OJSC. It will publish regularly report to the public about the sources and
uses of funds, including detailed information on the contractors hired by Rogun OJSC, their
ownership structure, and the bidding process used to award all contracts.
49.
As part of its efforts to meet health care MDGs, the government intends to improve
access to safe water. Evidence shows that a high rate of infant mortality is highly correlated
with limited access to safe water.17 According to the 2007 TLSS, 38 percent of respondents rely
mainly on lakes, streams, rivers, or unprotected wells for drinking water, especially in rural
areas. Given high rates of contamination among these water sources, this situation compromises
health outcomes through high risk of gastric illness, cholera, and typhoid. Coverage of water
supply services is reported to be 59 percent nationwide (93 percent in urban areas and 47 percent
in rural areas). Service hours in urban areas have declined, and bacteriological water quality is no
longer safe. In rural areas, many systems are inoperative due to the lack of maintenance and
trained operators. Piped wastewater collection reaches about 15 percent of the population (44
percent in urban areas and 3 percent in rural areas), reflecting very little improvement over the
past two decades. Many wastewater treatment plants operate at reduced capacity, which lowers
treatment efficiency. To meet its MDG targets by 2015, Tajikistan would need to increase
coverage of safe water supply services to 79 percent of the total population—a target that is
made even more difficult to reach by high population growth rates. With the support of the Bank
and other development partners (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
17

21

(EBRD) and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau – Entwicklungsbank (KfW Development
Bank)), the government is in the process of rehabilitating the water supply and sewage system in
the main urban areas.
50.
Strengthening Tajikistan’s stock of human capital will be a significant challenge
with important implications for medium-term growth. Insufficient and inequitable allocation
of public resources to the education and health sectors, together with the exodus of workers
overseas due to limited job opportunities and low wages, has contributed to an acute skill
shortage in the country and thus to a lowering of productive capacity and support for private
sector growth. The government’s anti-crisis action plan includes a small training program for
returned migrants as well as a small public works program to create jobs. The government is
committed to increasing social spending in order to maintain poor people’s access to basic social
services in a time of crisis and to deepening institutional and policy reforms in the social sectors
in order to strengthen human capital.
IV.

WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT

A. Bank Group Track Record
i. Portfolio performance
51.
The size of the Bank’s portfolio has remained stable over the last four years, with
the agriculture, energy, and water supply infrastructure sectors receiving almost 70
percent of total financing. During FY06-09, the portfolio included an average of 15 investment
projects and one development policy operation (DPO) each year. At the end of FY09, the
portfolio consisted of 16 investments, with commitments amounting to US$187.5 million, of
which about US$102 million were grants (IDA, Global Environment Facility (GEF), and trust
funds). About 60 percent of outstanding commitments have been disbursed. An Emergency Food
Crisis Grant of US$5 million and a DPO of US$20 million were fully disbursed in FY09. The
average portfolio age is 4.1 years. The largest share of the portfolio is in agriculture (31 percent),
followed by energy and water supply infrastructure (20 percent each), education (16 percent),
health (8 percent), and public sector (5 percent). Ongoing IDA operations in education and
agriculture are complemented by two stand-alone projects financed out of Bank-administered
trust funds for a total of US$23.4 million.18 Trust funds form an important part of the Bank’s
Tajikistan portfolio, amounting to US$60.4 million in active commitments. Sectors of focus
include health, education, food security, private and financial sector development, agriculture,
and energy.
52.
The pace of IDA financing has picked up, and portfolio risks have been mitigated.
The financing of the previous CPS has included both grants and loans, as the debt sustainability
outlook changed during the CPS period. The disbursement ratio increased from about 18 percent
during FY07-08 to 40 percent at the end of FY09, the highest in the ECA region (for which the
average is 16.6 percent). In tandem with the acceleration of project implementation,
18

These include the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI, US$18.4 million) and the fully disbursed
Food Security and Seeds Import Project (US$5 million) financed out of the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund.

22

commitments at risk intensified from 5.6 percent in FY07 to 28.5 percent in FY09. The rising
number of problem projects was largely attributed to difficulties in implementing project-related
structural reforms and slow progress in building implementation capacity. Thanks to regular
Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPR), the 2008 Country Portfolio Fiduciary Review
(CPFR) and close monitoring by the country team, problems have been addressed within 12
months and non-performing projects were restructured before the end of FY09.19
53.
Since 2004, Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) have been carried out
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and joint action plans have been implemented.20
The most recent joint portfolio review (December 2009) focused mainly on improving the
implementation of ongoing operations and ensuring development impact and sustainability of the
Bank’s operations. The review recommended the following: (i) strengthening the capacity of
implementing agencies, especially procurement, financial management, and monitoring and
evaluation; and (ii) ensuring retention of capacities in the implementing agencies with a view to
enable line ministries to implement projects in the long term and ensure sustainability of the
Bank’s operations.
54.
The 2008 CPFR revealed that the great majority of Bank-financed projects were
being managed satisfactorily. However, a number of deficiencies were noted in physical
inspections of civil works in nine projects, which is an area that has not received adequate
attention during project supervision. The review also highlighted weaknesses in contract
management, systems and procedures, staff capacity, and understanding of Bank requirements
and procedures for procurement, disbursement, and financial management. It was noted that
capacity in PIUs was generally stronger, as these units were able to attract better-qualified and
more experienced staff. On the other hand, projects implemented directly by recipient agencies
faced greater capacity constraints and lower performance standards. Addressing these
weaknesses in project implementing agencies will be a priority during the CPS period. In
addition, as Tajikistan’s overall governance environment continues to pose risks to the
effectiveness of Bank operations, the CPS program will work to manage country-level fiduciary
risks and improve transparency in public financial management. At the project level, the Bank
will mitigate these risks through implementation of the newly developed CGAC strategy (Annex
3), including through the use of a Governance Checklist to ensure that fiduciary and other
governance considerations are integrated into program design and supervision.
55.
IDA will regularly monitor its portfolio through follow-up fiduciary reviews, and
procurement and financial management training will be provided to the PIUs. Efforts will
also be made to manage fiduciary risks in trust-funded activities, including by better integrating
PIUs and implementing agencies, strengthening supervision, and ensuring that these activities do
not overwhelm limited administrative capacity.

The pro-activity index at the beginning of FY10 is 100 percent, which means that within 12 months after a project
was rated unsatisfactory, appropriate action was taken. In FY2008, problem projects were Land Cadastre, Dushanbe
Water Supply, and Cotton Sector Recovery. Potential problem projects were Avian Flu Risk Mitigation and Energy
Emergency. The Dushanbe Water Supply, Land Cadastre projects, and Avian Flu were restructured in June, July,
and December 2009, respectively. The Cotton Sector Recovery was restructured in March 2010.
20
Implementation of the detailed action plan developed jointly by the Government of Tajikistan, ADB and WB
(approved in December 2008) is being monitored closely and serves as the basis for tracking performance of the
ongoing portfolio.

23

56.
IFC’s investment and advisory services portfolio has continued to expand, with
strong results. In FY05-09, IFC invested a total of US$32.0 million in ten projects. Of this
amount, US$23.0 million was in 8 projects in the financial sector, including US$6.3 million for
microfinance. In addition, IFC approved US$2.5 million trade finance to Eskhata Bank under its
Global Trade Finance Facility. In the real sectors, IFC invested US$9 million in two projects in
the energy and hotel sectors. IFC commitments grew strongly in recent years, reaching around
US$16 million in both FY08 and FY09 (from less than US$1 million in previous years).
Investment projects have provided access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSMEs); strengthened access to electricity in remote areas; and created jobs. Advisory Services
(AS) spending has grown to nearly US$3 million annually, with demonstrable results in the
financial sector and policy arenas. The Tajikistan leasing portfolio across all financial institutions
grew by 860 percent from 2006 to 2008, reaching US$21.7 million. AS projects made significant
contributions to the passage of the Inspections Law, Mortgage Law, and Credit History Law, and
implementation of simplified taxation mechanisms. IFC manages US$11.8 million in active trust
fund commitments, focusing on the business enabling environment, SMEs, banking,
microfinance, and agricultural finance.
57.
IFC’s engagement in Tajikistan is limited by the size of potential investments and
high levels of public ownership and control of private sector enterprises, but combining
investment and AS is addressing these challenges. IFC’s global expertise, together with a
significant local and regional presence, is a strong formula for results in an IDA country such as
Tajikistan. Business environment reforms take several years of advisory and implementation
assistance to show results. For example, after many years of working on inspection reforms, the
Business Enabling Environment Bank (BEE) project is finally beginning to produce concrete
results for businesses. Similarly, success on the Leasing and Mortgage Laws has or is expected
to pave the way for expansion of these markets. On the other hand, with a relatively undeveloped
manufacturing and industrial base, investment and AS in the real sectors is a continuing
challenge.
ii. Implementation of the last CPS
58.
Implementation of the CPS program for FY06-09 has proceeded largely on track,
albeit with some delays. The mix of investment and development policy operations has been
consistent with the CPS, though the program has been modified at the margin based on
government requests and emerging needs. For example, given strong progress on poverty
reduction, the government felt that another poverty alleviation operation was unnecessary and
Poverty Alleviation III was cancelled. Instead, additional financing was provided to three
existing operations (Community and Basic Health Project (CBHP), Pamir Private Energy, and
Dushanbe Water Supply). In 2008 three new emergency projects were launched in response to
the energy and food crises: the Energy Emergency Recovery financed out of unallocated IDA14
and the Emergency Food Security and Seed Imports and additional financing to CBHP financed
by the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund. Preparation and delivery of some operations (treasury
modernization, sector-wide approach (SWAp) for education) took longer than expected due to
operational complexities, donor coordination delays, and government capacity limitations. The
Health SWAp under preparation was postponed due to limited IDA funding, and half the
allocation envisioned in the previous CPS was reallocated as additional financing for the CBHP
in 2009.
24

59.
A series of Programmatic Development Policy Grants (PDPG) drove policy dialogue
with the government and helped coordinate implementation of the CPS program. As such,
the PDPG contributed to the achievement of a significant share of CPS results in coordination
with IDA sector departments, IFC, and other development partners. Its agenda was broad,
touching on all of the core areas of the CPS, including private sector development, agriculture,
energy, education and health services, public sector reform, and public financial management.
PDPG implementation was most successful in areas that benefited from strong government
ownership, complementary technical assistance, consensus among development partners on the
way forward and long-term engagement on the part of the Bank Group.21 Drawing from this
experience, continued PDPG implementation is expected to help deepen progress on the
country’s ongoing reform agenda and to support reforms in emerging areas.
60.
Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) have helped understand and demonstrate
the benefits of reform in areas where there is limited buy-in from the authorities. A policy
note on aviation paved the way for Bank Group engagement on removing constraints to
accessing Tajikistan by air. The 2007 and 2008 Programmatic Public Expenditure Reviews
(PPERs) have underpinned coordination with other donors working in the social sectors
(education, health, and social protection) and thus helped improve public service delivery by
strengthening linkages between sector policies and budgeting. A Poverty Assessment and
subsequent update, based on the 2007 TLSS, have shed light on the nature and extent of poverty
in Tajikistan, helping to target assistance programs to those most in need—particularly in the
context of the ongoing crisis. The effectiveness of some AAA has been constrained, however, by
delays in delivery and uptake due to weak planning on the part of the Bank team.
61.
Though many of the results anticipated in the CPS have been achieved, it has
become clear that some objectives were somewhat ambitious given limited capacity and
weak government commitment to structural reforms in Tajikistan. The impact of the first
pillar—fostering broad-based growth in urban and rural areas—has been moderate, with some
progress in improving the business climate and enhancing access to finance. The gains that have
been made are at risk due to the global crisis and the government’s policy of financing the cotton
sector through banks. Agricultural reforms remain incomplete, though cotton-grading standards
have been introduced and the practice of cotton exports licensing by the NBT has been
eliminated. Objectives under the second pillar—preserving and enhancing the quality of health
and education—have been met for the most part. School attendance and completion rates, and
provision of health services have improved in regions where the Bank has provided support. In
the health sector, however, high out-of-pocket payments, combined with increasing hardship as a
result of the economic crisis, have caused utilization of health services in project areas to decline.
Access to clean water has improved in Dushanbe, but preliminary data suggest that overall
access has not changed since 2003. Objectives under the third pillar—improving delivery of
energy services and exploiting the country’s hydropower potential—were partially achieved. The
poor quality of energy supplies for the domestic market and weak corporate governance in the
energy and water sectors continues to constrain production. Though good progress has been

21

An Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) for the Tajikistan PDPG is under preparation and will
provide a thorough assessment of the program’s contribution to the country’s reform agenda in a difficult
environment.

25

made in developing a regional energy market, further large hydropower investments will be
required together with regional diplomatic initiatives to address geopolitical concerns.
62.
CPS interventions to improve governance and state capacity were below
expectations. The CPS emphasized governance and capacity building as crosscutting themes,
but interventions were limited to working with the central government. Some progress has been
made, in particular on civil service wage reform and recruitment, adoption of a public financial
management strategy, and promulgation of a new procurement law. Progress on public sector
restructuring has been less noticeable given the lack of an appropriate counterpart for the
overhaul that was envisaged. In general, the impact of the CPS program on the broader
governance picture in Tajikistan has been minimal.
63.
The main lesson learned from CPS implementation is not to overburden an
administration that suffers from poor capacity in planning, coordination, and execution
with an ambitious agenda. Moderate realism in program design, combined with strict
prioritization, can go a long way in ensuring the prompt delivery of results. A selective approach
helps to scale down overambitious goals, manage expectations, identify sources of risk, and
provide effective, appropriate capacity building support. While additional legal amendments in
selected areas will continue to be necessary, the next strategy should focus on implementing the
laws and strategies already in place, and, when trying to arrive at new institutional frameworks,
draw first on experimentation and dialogue rather than imposing new designs before attaining
sufficient understanding and buy-in from the authorities.
64.
The CPS Completion Report (Annex 5) completed in October 2009 provides
strategic and operational recommendations for the preparation of a new CPS. While both
the CPS agenda and the government’s 2007 PRS remain valid, the current global crisis has added
new urgencies that must be addressed within a long-term framework to prevent the recurrence of
slippages that took place over the last four years. Strategically, the CPSCR recommends that the
new CPS review the relevance and adequacy of ongoing operations and focus on achieving
realistic results in the context of current economic challenges and the country’s capacity to meet
them. The new CPS should thus aim to help Tajikistan develop the capacity to address shocks,
rebuild credibility and strengthen governance, increase energy potential, enable private sector
development, and consolidate fragile gains in health and education by further strengthening the
relevant ministries and scaling up successful pilot initiatives. Operationally, the CPSCR
recommends that the new CPS pursue greater selectivity; embed the capacity development and
governance agendas fully into sector work and, where necessary, assess ownership and
commitment capacity through political economy analysis; retain the mix of budget support and
investment operations; disseminate the results of AAA to generate broad public understanding of
and support for reforms; and adopt a gradual approach to harmonization among development
partners in order to improve implementation performance and reduce costs. The CPS experience
shows that reforms can be achieved under a program that is well targeted with well-defined
outcomes, and that is underpinned by solid AAA, TA, and sufficient time and resources
dedicated to policy dialogue and capacity development.

26

B. Proposed WBG Strategy
i. CPS objectives
65.
In line with government priorities and the lessons learned through past
implementation, the CPS is designed to focus on two objectives: (i) reducing the negative
impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability; and (ii) paving the way for post-crisis recovery
and sustained development. In order to support sustainable progress toward these objectives,
efforts to improve core governance will be tackled directly and also mainstreamed across the
CPS program within the context of the CGAC strategy (Annex 3). Attention to capacity
development and gender equality will be mainstreamed across sectors and projects.
66.
The CPS will rely on a mix of instruments, including the continuation of the PDPG
series, investment activities, and targeted AAA. Selectivity within and across sectors, and
according to the Bank Group’s comparative advantage in relation to other development partners,
will be critical given the limited resources available. The indicative IDA15 allocation for
Tajikistan is projected to be about US$86.6 million (SDR 55.9 million), about 13 percent lower,
in absolute terms, than under IDA14 (SDR 64.6 million). About US$30 million of the IDA15
envelope was allocated in FY09 to implementation of the CPS for FY06-09. The remaining
allocation (about US$57 million) will finance the first two years of the CPS. More than half the
IDA15 allocation will support the PDPG, and the remainder will be distributed across investment
activities. Trust funds, which will almost match the IDA allocation in FY10-11, will continue to
play an important role in supporting the CPS program. In addition to these resources, Tajikistan
will receive additional funding equivalent to US$23.4 million (SDR 15.3 million) in FY10 from
the IDA Crisis Window to address the impacts of the global crisis and it may be eligible to
access IDA regional funds and IBRD enclave loans for economically viable infrastructure.
ii. Expected CPS results
67.

The expected results of the proposed CPS program are listed in Table 3 below.

27

68.
Governance reforms cut across the entire CPS program. The Bank Group’s
governance interventions will take three forms: (i) transparency and accountability measures; (ii)
capacity development; and (iii) supporting demand for good governance. These interventions
will be carried out at the country, sector, and project levels. This approach to “mainstreaming”
governance reform has been developed in response to lessons learned under the previous CPS,
where efforts to address governance were restricted to the central government level and not well
integrated into sector approaches or individual program design. Mainstreaming does not mean
abandoning central-level governance reforms, but complementing them with an equal emphasis
on sector- and project-level interventions. While core governance initiatives such as public sector
reform and public financial management will be tackled directly at the country level, Bank
support to governance reforms at the sector level will be mainstreamed across all expected CPS
results with heightened attention to priority areas (private and financial sector development,
agriculture, and energy). At the project level, the Bank will apply a Governance Checklist to all
new projects and additional financing throughout the project cycle in order to ensure that project
design helps strengthen transparency, accountability, capacity, and demand for good governance,
while safeguarding against political economy and fiduciary risks.
Objective I: Reduce the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability
69.
Result 1: Maintain macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite
for both short-term economic viability and medium-term recovery. The CPS program, jointly
with the IMF’s ECF, will help Tajikistan develop and maintain a positive track record of stable
macroeconomic management to bolster investor confidence in the economy’s potential. The CPS
will provide financial support and TA on fiscal and expenditure management to help the country
address the ongoing economic crisis in the context of limited fiscal space and without harming
its debt sustainability. This will contribute to strengthening governance by supporting the
development of central government capacity to transparently manage its finances. IFC will
contribute to macroeconomic stability through direct investment in the real economy, as well as
through investments in financial institutions to expand access to finance for MSMEs in order to
help maintain and create jobs, support trade finance, and attract further foreign investment, thus
creating demonstration effects for other investors.
70.
Result 2: Maintain access to critical public services. There is an urgent need to ensure
that access to education and health services is preserved during the economic crisis, especially
for the poorest segments of the population. Through the PDPG, IDA will provide budget support
to help the government protect pro-poor spending in the education and health sectors, focusing
resources on the most critical areas of basic and general education and primary health care
(PHC). The Education Modernization project and the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative
Catalytic Fund (EFA-FTI CF) are helping to maintain access to education through the
rehabilitation of school infrastructure, provision of higher-quality equipment and textbooks,
upgrading of personnel capacity, improvement of management capacity, and strengthening of
education spending efficiency. Additional financing provided to the CBHP will scale up efforts
to introduce capitation and output-based payments for PHC, building on reforms financed by the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition, the project will
rehabilitate PHC facilities in selected areas and expand training of doctors and nurses. Efforts to
28

improve the efficiency and transparency of spending on education and health will also support
the governance agenda.
71.
Result 3: Reduce risk for vulnerable groups through enhanced social protection. To
mitigate the vulnerability of poor people during the crisis, the CPS will support efforts to reduce
food insecurity, create short-term employment opportunities, and strengthen management of the
social protection system. To support the immediate food security of the poorest farmers and
female-headed households and help these groups recover production losses, IDA will allocate
additional financing to the Food Security and Seed Import project to provide inputs needed for
agricultural production and livestock management. The Second Community Agriculture and
Watershed Management project will help provide rural people in uplands (non-cotton growing)
areas with investment capital and skills needed to increase agricultural yields. The CPS will also
support activities to generate jobs and income, especially in rural areas. Additional financing
provided to the Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management project and a new Emergency
Employment program, financed by the EC and administered by IDA, will support rehabilitation
of irrigation and drainage systems, thus creating short-term employment in key areas of the
country. In addition, it will support the development, adoption, and implementation of an
integrated policy and institutional reforms necessary for the effective management of the
country’s water resources through strengthening the linkages between the agriculture
development and water resource management strategies to ensure sustainable and
environmentally friendly development. Finally, IDA will provide TA to improve targeting and
administration of the safety net system as a whole, and to strengthen administration and capacity
for pension policymaking. The TA will be designed to complement PDPG support for the
development of a methodology for effectively targeting social assistance. IDA will also
collaborate with the EC to assist the government in developing and implementing a social
protection strategy. Efforts to increase coverage and reduce leakage in social protection benefits
will bolster governance reforms.
Objective II: Pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development
72.
Result 4: Strengthen the business-enabling environment. The Bank Group will
continue to support government initiatives to improve Tajikistan’s Doing Business ranking. The
IFC’s BEE project seeks to reduce administrative barriers in inspections and permits and to
lower tax compliance costs by simplifying tax administration. The IFC BEE project is working
with the government to significantly reduce the number of permits applied to businesses through
a quick review methodology, generating cost savings for the private sector and setting the
groundwork for Regulatory Impact Assessment in Tajikistan. Through its Agri-Finance and
Business Environment program, IFC will help strengthen the regulatory framework for private
investment, improve access to finance for agri-business via investments in financial institutions
(banks and microfinance institutions), and support leasing development. The project will work
with financial institutions to build capacity to evaluate credit for medium-term leasing and
equipment finance products, resulting in improved access to finance and equipment for
agribusiness to improve productivity. Governance reforms related to private sector regulation are
critical to fostering private sector growth and employment creation. The IFC infrastructure
advisory service’s assistance in conducting an international tender for the exploration and
development of the Bolshoi Konimansur silver deposits is intended to have demonstration effects
29

for the transparency of the broader international tender process, thus helping to attract the foreign
investment needed for large infrastructure projects. IDA will work with other development
partners to strengthen the capacity of the State Property and Investment Committee through
ongoing TA. IDA will also work - in collaboration with the UK DFID and the Doing Business
Reform Advisory Team - with the relevant Tajik institutions to simplify business start-up,
construction permits, property registration, and border trading procedures that are instrumental
for private sector development in Tajikistan. IDA will also work with the relevant institutions to
simplify construction permits, property registration, and border trading procedures that are
instrumental for private sector development in Tajikistan. The multi-year PDPG will provide the
framework for policy dialogue to push these reforms forward.22 IDA will also explore the growth
potential of the mining sector, conducting a mining institutional assessment through a grant from
the Institutional Development Fund, reviewing the mining law, and undertaking in-depth mining
sector reforms under the PDPG. 
73.
In the financial sector, the immediate priority is to strengthen governance of the
NBT by increasing its capacity and restoring its credibility in full. Through a grant from the
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative, IDA will continue to provide TA
to help improve financial stability and strengthen access to financial services; IDA may also
support a project on strengthening access to finance, if warranted on the basis of a planned rural
investment climate assessment (RICA).23 IDA will help the authorities finalize and implement a
medium-term financial sector development strategy and action plan, drawing upon the
recommendations of the 2008 FSAP and focusing on sustained improvements in the legal and
institutional framework. IFC will provide investment funds, including debt, equity, and trade
finance to financial and microfinance institutions. IFC will provide AS on financial risk
management, credit management, and development of a private credit bureau. Over the medium
term, IFC will work with the government to expand secure access to finance for individual
consumers and MSMEs under the Azerbaijan and Central Asia Financial Markets Infrastructure
project and Microfinance Transformation project. The Azerbaijan and Central Asia Financial
Markets Infrastructure Project will increase the availability and use of credit information for
financial institutions to evaluate borrowers; the Microfinance Transformation Project works with
microfinance institutions that are existing or potential IFC investment clients to expand deposits
and the range of financial services, leading to increased ability of microfinance institutions to
raise funds in the market.
74.
Result 5: Improve conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.
The recent government resolution to resolve the outstanding cotton debt and enhance freedom to
farm will help enable the realization of agricultural sector potential. These initiatives will also
support efforts to lower rural poverty because cotton producers—particularly in the Khatlon and
Sogd regions—are the poorest and most food insecure people in rural areas. The CPS will
support efforts to develop a sustainable solution for rural finance, as the new cotton financing
mechanism of on-lending budgetary funds to the agricultural sector through commercial banks
poses considerable risks to the banking system and to agricultural sustainability. IDA will

22

Key partners in this area include the EC, Swiss Economic Cooperation (SECO), United Kingdom Department for
International Development (DFID), and USAID.
23
The RICA will be carried out with support from DFID.

30

support implementation of the government’s action plan to secure land use rights, eliminate
government intervention in cotton production, and resolve farm debt.
75.
Policy dialogue on these issues will be underpinned by AAA (including the RICA),
PDPG, and existing investment operations on the Land Cadastre Registration System and Cotton
Sector Recovery.24 The Bank Group will also increase its support to non-cotton areas. The
Community Agriculture and Watershed Management project is working to reduce land
degradation, soil erosion and water pollution.25 Additional financing will be provided to the
Ferghana Valley Water Resources Management project to support the rehabilitation of irrigation
and drainage systems, and a new Emergency Employment program will support government
efforts to rehabilitate irrigation systems in Soghd and Khatlon oblasts. IFC’s Agri-Finance and
Business Environment project will continue to improve agricultural finance in the cotton sector,
helping to support the governance agenda. IFC will also seek investments in private agribusiness companies.
76.
The improvement of agricultural productivity will depend in part on efforts to prevent,
mitigate and adapt to disaster and climate change risks under the newly launched regional
disaster risk mitigation (DRM) program. Tajikistan has been selected as one of nine pilot
countries taking part in the Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR), which is expected to
bring an additional fund about US$35 million in grant resources to support initiatives such as
drought-proofing agricultural activities, strengthening resilience to climate change among
vulnerable rural populations, modernizing hydromet services, developing a water adaptation plan
for the Amu Darya river basin, and reducing financial vulnerability (among households and in
the broader economy) to the adverse impacts of disasters and climate change. Tajikistan is also
one of three countries benefiting from a regional project, funded by the Global Facility for
Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR), on improving weather and climate service delivery in highrisk, low-income countries. CPS support for the elimination of hazardous Persistent Organic
Pollutants (POPs) will help reduce the risk of land pollution and help Tajikistan meet obligations
under the Stockholm Convention on POPs.
77.
Result 6. Improve the reliability of electricity and gas services and increase energy
support potential. In the short run, IDA will continue to support government efforts to urgently
increase the volume and reliability of energy supply through an additional financing to the
Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project by pooling $15 million IDA funds with
government budget and other donor resources to ensure reliable gas supply to the Dushanbe
combined heat power (CHP) plant, electricity supply from commercial hydropower entities and
electricity imports for the 2009-2010 and the 2010-2011 winters. IDA will continue supporting
loss reduction in the power system through a follow up to the Energy Loss Reduction Project
which will also strengthen Barki Tajik’s planning, financial management and operational
functions.

24

IDA’s Cotton Sector Recovery Project is being restructured to provide a credit line for post harvest finance and
support to farmers to raise production through reputable commercial banks.
25
These represent the three environmental issues with the most detrimental impact on GDP. See World Bank. 2008.
Country Environmental Analysis.

31

78.
Developing hydropower in a responsible way will secure the country’s energy
supply and gradually generate electricity export revenues. The World Bank recognizes the
unique value hydropower brings to the Central Asia region. It also recognizes the close
connections to difficult issues of water management, connections that are even more important in
the context of climate change. As part of a regional program on energy and water, the World
Bank will work with the Government of Tajikistan and regionally recognized institutions to
strengthen the technical and institutional basis for cooperation on energy and water and, over
time, for mutual economic, environmental and social benefits. In addition to regional benefits,
this work will increase attractiveness of hydropower investments in Tajikistan and reduce risks
related to water management. IFC will be examining hydropower investments in Tajikistan for
potential investment.
79.
The Bank and the government agreed to join efforts to revise and refine the 2007
energy strategy and align it with the government’s long term objectives. The management of
the isolated power system requires the development of stronger planning, engineering and
operation functions in addition of reinforcement of commercial functions. The Bank has already
incorporated capacity building in the projects under implementation at the country level and
these efforts will be amplified in follow up projects under consideration. Complementary needs
will be identified during the preparation of the energy strategy under preparation by the World
Bank in cooperation with Tajik authorities and energy institutions. The World Bank Group and
the Government of Tajikistan energy partnership will focus on: (a) electricity loss reduction, (b)
improving energy system efficiency and security, and (c) development of hydropower resources
of the country, including for the purpose of export.
80.
In terms of engagement in large hydropower programs such as Rogun, the Bank is
supporting the preparation of comprehensive technical, social and environmental
assessments. Subject to confirmation of the project’s technical soundness, economic viability
and compliance with all relevant environmental and social safeguards – the World Bank would
consider leading the consortium to implement the Rogun project. Tajikistan has a significant
potential to achieve increased production from the rehabilitation of existing hydropower
facilities, such as Nurek and Karaikkum, and these programs will be evaluated further. Regional
transmission programs for power exchange, such as CASA1000 and other transmission linkages
would be evaluated and implemented. The World Bank Group is committed to ensuring that
regional projects are proven to be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable at the
regional level. To meet the funding requirements of many of these projects, the Bank would
consider IBRD enclave loans, partial risk guarantees for projects that increase exports to reliable
power off-takers in the region which could lead to sufficient credit enhancement for loan
repayment. Hydropower projects with private sector participation and sufficient credit quality
will be considered for IFC loans and equity participation. IFC also remains willing to support
regional transmission projects with private sector participation, subject to their feasibility. The
Bank plans to access Regional IDA resources for projects that strengthen regional cooperation
and increase power exchange/trade leading to optimal use of resources.
81.
Result 7: Improve the provision of safe water in Dushanbe and selected
municipalities. Under the CPS, IDA will continue to improve access to safe water in the capital
city (with a population of 600,000, one-quarter of Tajikistan’s urban population) through a
repeater project, Dushanbe Water Supply. This operation will help reduce poverty through the
32

provision of continuous safe water. The program will also support governance improvements by
reducing wastage and improving efficiency and transparency through extended metering of
households, public institutions, and industries, and by strengthening the corporate governance of
SOEs through the corporatization of the Dushanbe Municipal Vodokanal. Should the central
government and Dushanbe municipal governments wish, the additional financing could also be
used to strengthen the role of the private sector through outsourcing of selected functions to
specialized private companies. These efforts will also help mitigate the economic crisis through
employment generation. IDA will also provide additional financing to the ongoing
Municipalities Development project to increase access to safe water in eight other municipalities.
82.
Result 8: Strengthen the quality of public services to enhance human capital
potential. In education, the government’s National Strategy for Education Development (NSED)
for 2006-2015 and its associated action plan provide a common framework for a SWAp to be
supported by development partners. In addition, IDA’s Education Modernization project will
continue to support the institutionalization of fair and transparent student assessments, upgraded
training modules for teachers, improved monitoring and evaluation, and policy reform. In
parallel, the FTI CF26 will help scale up reform efforts supported by the previous CPS in
education financing, school infrastructure rehabilitation, and education management. Key
governance reforms in the education sector include increasing transparency and accountability
through per capita financing, and improving fairness and transparency in university admissions
through unified university entrance examination. Finally, the Bank is cooperating with Russia to
implement a program to Improve Central Asian Migrants’ Life Skills, including improving their
understanding of Russian labor regulations and procedures and building financial literacy. This
initiative will give Tajikistan’s migrant workers a stronger understanding of their rights and raise
their bargaining power and marketability abroad.
83.
In health, the CPS will scale up ongoing efforts to improve the equitable allocation
of resources and efficiency in health service provision, thus improving quality of care.
Priorities include scaling up per capita financing for PHC, introducing output-based financing for
hospitals, reforming payment systems in PHC centers and hospitals, rehabilitating infrastructure,
and training medical and fiduciary staff in the Ministry of Health (MoH). These initiatives will
help strengthen governance in the health sector through improved transparency and fiduciary
capacity.

26

In December 2005, the ECA-FTI CF agreed to grant US$18.4 million to Tajikistan in support of the NSED. The first-year
allocation (FTI-1) of US$9.2 million was made available in mid-2006. The Ministry of Education (MoE) is implementing the
second-year allocation (FTI-2) and is preparing an application package for the third year to be considered by the FTI-CF in
October 2009.

33

Crosscutting Initiatives to Support CPS Objectives
84.
To achieve the above objectives, the CPS will place governance at center stage.
Strengthening governance systems is crucial for ensuring long-term development effectiveness.
In addition to direct, country-level work on public sector reform and public financial
management (Results 9 and 10), governance will be mainstreamed in sectors and projects—
especially in agriculture, energy, and private and financial sector development—to support
achievement of the objectives in the context of the CGAC strategy (Annex 3). Moreover, there is
a need to better understand governance at all levels in Tajikistan. In this context, the CPS will
carry out an Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) with a focus on national-subnational
government relations, exploring the relationships between the institutional structure and
governance outcomes, such as service delivery at the local level. The key sectors to explore the
structure of national-subnational relations are energy, rural development, health and education.
The CPS will also explore the potential for Tajikistan’s participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI), which promotes the publication and verification of company
payments and government revenues from resource extraction. These initiatives represent critical
steps along the long-term path to strengthening governance in Tajikistan. As shown in other
countries with governance weaknesses, progress on governance reforms in Tajikistan will require
patience and perseverance.
85.
Result 9: Strengthen incentives for better performance of civil servants. The
government is working to develop a new Law on the Organization of Public Administration,
which will establish the hierarchy, competences, and accountability of public entities in
Tajikistan. Functional reviews are planned in seven ministries, followed by the preparation of
detailed institutional development plans by the end of 2010. The Bank will support these efforts
through the ongoing Public Sector Reform project, though it is anticipated that progress will
remain slow in the absence of a dedicated unit within central government that is responsible for
leading and coordinating the reform effort. Under this CPS, the Bank will work with the
government to achieve greater synergy between central public administration reforms and sector
reforms aimed at strengthening the efficiency and effectiveness of social service delivery. This
will be achieved through targeted institutional restructuring in the sectors, improved planning
and budgeting, introduction of merit-based recruitment and performance appraisal systems
linked to pay and career progression, and support for capacity building and accountability in the
civil service. The PDPG will support policy actions in this area.
86.
Result 10: Strengthen transparency and accountability in public financial
management. To help ensure that scarce public resources are used for their intended purposes,
the Public Financial Management Modernization project will support reforms outlined in the
action plan for the government’s Public Financial Management Reform Strategy. In
collaboration with development partners, this project will focus on improving the basic building
blocks of public financial management (budget preparation, budget execution, public accounting,
and fiscal reporting); reforming business processes and institutional arrangements; and
strengthening capacity. The PDPG will support the government’s ongoing efforts to strengthen
transparency and accountability through the establishment of an independent external audit
agency. IDA will work with the government to develop an information and communication
technology (ICT) or “e-government” strategy to improve efficiency in public service
provisioning using limited public resources. IDA’s work on public financial management and
34

SOE corporate governance will be undertaken in collaboration with the IMF’s ongoing ECF. A
multi-donor trust fund on Public Finance Voice and Accountability (PFVA) will help create
visible citizen demand for efficient and effective use of state finances to upgrade essential public
services by strengthening Parliamentary oversight, media communication and citizen
involvement in public finance and service delivery.
87.
Recognizing the significant capacity constraints faced by the government, and their
potential role in slowing implementation of the CPS program, the Bank Group will focus
on capacity development and human capital formation across interventions. The CPS will
continue existing efforts to build capacity in key ministries involved in the execution of CPS
programs, focusing on both institutional reforms and skills training. Ongoing TA on
macroeconomic management will be underpinned by training for civil servants on fiscal and
expenditure management. Programs in the education sector will focus on strengthening policy
development and management capacity within the Ministry of Education, together with training
programs for teachers and migrant workers. Health sector initiatives will strengthen capacity to
administer a basic package of health services at central and local levels. Work in the agriculture
sectors will support training for communities on productive farming techniques, farmland
restructuring, and micro-credit principles. Infrastructure development programs in energy and
water will focus on strengthening technical and financial management capacity of relevant SOEs.
Support for public sector reform and public financial management modernization will include
substantial capacity development components, including development of new training modules
on organizational management and human resources management, knowledge transfer and
change management workshops, and in-service training to help improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of public financial management in the public administration. Across the program,
application of the Governance Checklist will ensure that the design and review of individual
projects takes into account capacity development needs and opportunities. The World Bank
Institute (WBI) will buttress the country team’s efforts to build capacity development into the
design of specific projects and programs (paragraph 103). The CGAC strategy will review
capacity development experience during the last CPS and provide recommendations for
improved project-based capacity development results framework.
88.
The CPS will also mainstream efforts to address gender disparity in Tajikistan,
recognizing the important contribution that gender equality can make to economic growth
and poverty reduction, and thereby the achievement of the MDGs. Gender disparities in
Tajikistan are significant, despite existing legal frameworks intended to manage them. The ratio
of female-headed households is high in Tajikistan as a result of the civil war, the migration of
young men to other countries in search of work, and the lower life expectancy of male workers.
Nearly 35 percent of Tajikistan’s migrant households and 17 percent of non-migrant households
are headed by women. Female-headed households are highly dependent on remittances and thus
more vulnerable to shocks. Though women account for half of the country’s active labor force,
their participation is low and their earnings are lower than those of male workers, especially in
agriculture where women are predominantly employed. Women’s access to land and finance is
limited. In view of these obstacles, the CPS will seek to mainstream gender initiatives across
elements of the program where gender disparities exist, including access to primary education,
labor force participation and remuneration, and access to land and credit. Gender-related support
will be included explicitly in relevant programs, and results will be measured through the
collection and use of gender-disaggregated data where appropriate.
35

iii. CPS results framework
89.
The results expected from CPS implementation will be influenced significantly by
the ongoing investment portfolio. Seventeen projects are currently under implementation, with
about US$62 million still to be disbursed as of March 31, 2010. New commitments under the
CPS from regular IDA resources amount to US$ 140.4 million and from trust funds amount to
US$57 million. New interventions will support the achievement of results in selected areas,
including reducing vulnerability in the face of limited economic diversification and difficult
geography.
90.
The results matrix (Annex 1) is designed around clear principles: selectivity and
measurability of indicators based on the availability and reliability of baseline data; and realism
about the role of the Bank Group in contributing to the achievement of results. Anticipated
results are closely linked to national strategies to demonstrate the proposed CPS program’s
contribution to country development objectives. Where possible, results indicators have been
clearly defined on the basis of monitoring exercises already being undertaken or planned by the
Bank Group and other development partners. The PDPG will support regular monitoring of a
subset of CPS results, and the remainder will be addressed through sector dialogue.
91.
Progress in achieving expected CPS results will be reviewed mid-stream. A CPSPR
will be prepared in early FY12 to evaluate the relevance of the strategy outlined in the CPS,
review progress toward achieving CPS objectives and outcomes, and lay out proposed program
adjustments over the remainder of the CPS period. In particular, the CPSPR will serve as the
platform to further define activities for the last two years of the CPS period (FY12-13).
C. Implementing the CPS
i. Principles of engagement
92.
Frontloading. In order to provide a timely and effective response to the ongoing crisis
and any subsequent economic deterioration that may occur, the Bank Group will frontload some
IDA resources. This will be achieved by channeling more IDA resources through the PDPG.
93.
Flexibility. Given uncertainties regarding the duration of the global recession and its
impact on Tajikistan, the CPS program is designed to be flexible. A specific program is outlined
only for FY10 and FY11. IDA activities for the remaining CPS period (FY12-13) are indicative
and will only be laid out in detail following completion of the mid-stream CPSPR. This
flexibility will enable the CPS to adapt to changing circumstances as the crisis plays out and its
impact on Tajikistan is measured.
94.
Selectivity. The CPS will take a selective approach, recognizing the limitations in IDA
resources and administrative budgets, and the need to intensify supervision of individual
programs to mitigate fiduciary risks. The Bank Group will focus its advisory services in areas
that are expected to enhance the effectiveness of its programs and the development impact on its
client. Selectivity will be achieved by: (i) focusing the bulk of new investments on a few sectors
(e.g., agriculture, energy, urban water supply, and social services) where it has a long-standing
engagement and a comparative advantage vis-à-vis other donors; (ii) scaling up only successful
pilot investment projects through additional financing; and (iii) limiting the number of new IDA
36

investment projects to only one to two projects per year in order to increase the resources
devoted to program supervision. Where government ownership and reform progress are
considered weak and uncertain, the Bank Group will withdraw its interventions. In sectors where
the presence of other donors is significant, the Bank Group will complement their efforts with
advisory services and global knowledge, and only if necessary.
95.
Leveraging. The Bank Group will leverage its global knowledge and expertise to attract
co-financing from traditional and non-traditional development partners. Under the CPS, the Bank
will also seek to leverage multi-door trust funds to finance investment in global public goods
(e.g., public participation, climate change and disaster management) while ensuring that these
activities do not detract from the Bank’s capacity to implement the core IDA program. The JCPS
recently developed by key development partners in Tajikistan, including the Bank Group will
also help attract additional financing from donors based on the agreed framework.
ii. Instruments of support
96.
The proposed CPS program will maintain a mix between budget support and
investment activities. Budget support will be programmatic and will serve as an important
instrument for policy reform and dialogue with the government, in combination with investment
projects and TA. Investment activities will support government implementation of priority
reforms. The design of these initiatives will be informed by targeted AAA, which will include
analysis and TA to assist the government in implementing identified reforms. The Bank and IFC
can also access various trust funds to extend the reach of AAA and investments, subject to the
country’s absorptive capacity and Bank staff resources. In addition, IFC will provide direct
investments to the private sector.
97.
A new PDPG series is proposed for fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012. This
programmatic operation will focus on addressing the impact of the economic crisis and
deepening reforms that were initiated under the previous PDPG series. While the specific
objectives and reform actions are still to be agreed with the government, the PDPG is expected to
support reforms in several areas critical to Tajikistan’s growth and development: (i) maintaining
macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening the private and financial sectors; (iii) enhancing the
transparency of energy SOEs; (iv) diversifying agriculture; and (v) improving the social safety
net. The PDPG may also cover regulatory reform and public service delivery improvements. The
operation will include only core areas where there is strong government ownership, where
underlying TA resources can readily be mobilized from the Bank or other development partners,
and where there is a strong analytical basis for moving forward. The Bank will take the lead in
coordinating development partners’ budget support under the PDPG. Budget support will be
disbursed upon confirmation by the IMF that the ECF is on track.
98.
In the short term, the PDPG will provide fiscal space to allow the authorities to
reduce vulnerabilities. Interventions will be designed and sequenced not only to help the
government cope with the pressing consequences of the global economic crisis, but also to
support medium-term reforms to ensure a sustained recovery and continued development of the
country’s human capital. With additional budget support, the government will be able to protect
critical expenditures from budget cuts due to revenue shortfalls. To assess the performance of

37

PDPG support, a virtual poverty fund will be created to ring-fence expenditures in pro-poor
areas. A tracking mechanism will be established to monitor spending and impact in these areas.
99.
The indicative CPS program for FY10-13 is laid out in Table 4. As mentioned above,
the strategy relies largely on additional financing for ongoing programs with a proven track
record, allowing for shortened preparation time and accelerated implementation. Where
appropriate, ongoing operations have been or will be realigned to conform to the objectives of
the new CPS. New investment operations will address the impact of the crisis and contribute to
achievement of the medium-term objectives. To ensure that scarce IDA resources are utilized
fully and effectively, in case the government undermines macroeconomic stability objective and
PGPG program is delayed, the CPS will accelerate planned additional financing that will have
direct impact on the livelihoods of poor people in Tajikistan. In a fragile state such as Tajikistan,
continued IDA engagement is necessary to help keep the country from falling deeper into crisis.
Specific CPS activities for FY12-13 will be more specifically laid out following the completion
of a mid-term CPSPR and after the indicative IDA16 funding envelope is known. Only the FY10
allocation is firm while estimates for FY11, 12 and 13 are indicative only and can change. Actual
allocations in these years will depend on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s
performance rating; (iii) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; (iv) the
terms of IDA's assistance to Tajikistan (grants or credits); and (v) the number of IDA-eligible
countries. FY12 and FY13 indicative allocation assumes a similar level of replenishment in
IDA16 as in IDA15. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US$
equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Finally, the terms of the assistance
(i.e., grants, credits or a mix of the two) will depend on Tajikistan's debt sustainability position.
In addition to IDA performance-based allocation, Tajikistan benefits from funding under the
IDA Crisis Window in the amount of SDR 15.3 million (about US$23.4 million) in FY10.
100. AAA will focus on “just in time” TA driven by client demand and selected
analytical work to address knowledge gaps. Table 5 presents AAA planned during the CPS
period. Macroeconomic monitoring will help the government manage the crisis budget during
the next few years. A poverty assessment update will analyze the impact of the crisis on poor
households by geographical location. IDA will also work with the government to develop a
comprehensive energy sector strategy to ensure that energy investments are prioritized and
integrated in a holistic approach. An Institutional Governance Review (IGR) is proposed to
deepen understanding about political economy at the local level. Finally, follow-up activities will
be undertaken to ensure progress in implementing the recommendations of previously completed
diagnostic work, such as the CPFR, PEFA, and the Accounting and Auditing Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (A&A ROSC).

iii. IDA-IFC collaboration
101. Recognizing the critical role of private sector development in ensuring sustainable
growth and poverty alleviation in Tajikistan, IDA and IFC will continue to collaborate
closely. The assistance programs of each organization will be coordinated to maximize the Bank
Group’s overall impact on the expected CPS results. IDA programs will target the Bank’s
comparative advantage in providing global knowledge and TA to underpin investment operations
in support of the government’s development agenda. IFC programs will support the private
sector through advisory services and investments in the business environment, financial sector
development, and in support of the agriculture and energy sectors. IFC and IDA will continue to
work closely on fostering private investment; strengthening the soundness and stability of the
financial sector; improving service reliability, governance, and export potential in the energy
sector; and improving conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity.
iv. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
102. MIGA is prepared to support foreign direct investment into Tajikistan through the
provision of political risk guarantees. However, MIGA’s activity in Tajikistan in FY10-11 will
be primarily driven by foreign investors’ demand. MIGA will coordinate its potential
involvement in support of foreign investments into Tajikistan with IDA and IFC.

40

v. WBI program
103. WBI will continue to support capacity building efforts in the areas of public
financial management (PFM), procurement, trade, health, climate change, and publicprivate partnerships. WBI will focus on facilitating structured learning in partnership with
regional and local institutions and practitioner networks, emphasizing just-in-time practitioner
exchanges and South-South learning to address key capacity constraints to achieving
development results, and focusing on the “how” of reform (practitioner knowledge, leadership
and multi-stakeholder consensus building). WBI will provide support through the two of its new
business lines - the Global Partner platform and the Practitioner Exchange platform. WBI will
also help national institutions to connect globally and to draw on a range of relevant experiences.
Activities will include upgrading skills, updating curriculum, sharing lessons learned and best
practices, consensus-building workshops, and long-term TA to strengthen the capacity of key
government staff.
vi. Regional cooperation
104. During the CPS period, the Bank will continue to support a number of regional
initiatives through the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program.
Areas of CAREC support include energy, transport and trade facilitation, and communicable
disease prevention and disaster management. The Bank Group will work with Tajikistan and
other Central Asian countries to elaborate a Regional Energy-Water Development Framework
covering existing and potential energy generation resources in the region, including hydropower,
coal, thermal energy, and others. This framework would propose a sequence of actions to ensure
a proper balance between the urgent domestic energy needs of the upstream countries during
winter, and the environmental and hydrological needs of the downstream countries during
summer. The proposed framework would also focus on maximizing energy export potential
within the region during winter and beyond the region during summer. The latter would be
supported by the establishment of a Central Asia-South Asia Regional Energy Market
(CASAREM), a set of projects for enabling power trade within and between Central and South
Asia. In addition, in the context of the elaboration of a Regional Energy-Water Development
Framework, the Bank Group plans to contribute to the identification of immediate and mediumterm investment priorities in the region for consideration by all Central Asian countries and
potential investors to maximize gains from regional cooperation. In parallel, the Bank Group will
review water resource development and water management issues with stakeholders and partners
in Central Asia with a view to supporting the development of and access to these resources (Box
3). In transport and trade facilitation, the on-going Bank financed study on the performance of
selected road transport corridors in Central Asia is now being complemented by a series of
technical assistance activities (financed by a grant from the Trade Facilitation Facility) in the
area of transport and logistics. Activities will include (i) logistics chain analysis for specific
products and transport routes, as well as (ii) policy advice on issues pertinent to the development
of logistics and transport.

41

Box 3: Regional Energy-Water Development Framework

The WB is working with the governments of the five Central Asian countries to develop a comprehensive, longterm program to increase regional cooperation, encourage efficient energy resource development, and address water
management challenges. It is intended that this program will draw on Central Asian regional institutions—including
the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) and others—to conduct the analysis and coordinate
stakeholder consultations on key development choices and trade-offs. Work on the Central Asia Energy-Water
Development Framework (CAEWDF) aims to help Central Asian countries take advantage of their energy and
water resource base in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, while respecting national priorities and
safeguarding regional stability. The Bank has initiated the development of this program in consultation with
regional governments and international development agencies active in the region.
The program addresses three main themes: (a) balancing energy options to take advantage of the region’s rich
diversity in energy resources while addressing winter energy deficits, including new energy investments; (b)
expanding energy trade within and outside the region by strengthening regional dispatch and investing in
transmission infrastructure; and (c) working with regional organizations on energy-water linkages by securing
strong analytical foundations, supporting dialogue among Central Asian countries, and (d) improving water use
productivity in both the energy and agricultural sectors.

D. Partnerships and Participation
105. The Bank Group is developing strong partnerships with key development partners
in Tajikistan in the context of the JCPS. Two recent studies showed that the delivery of donor
assistance in Tajikistan has been sub-optimal in the past due to weak donor coordination, limited
government ownership, misalignment between donor and government programs, and a lack of
predictability and timeliness in donor funding. In 2007, an initial group of development partners
led by DFID came together to develop a JCPS with the aim of enhancing aid effectiveness
through alignment and harmonization, in line with the 2005 Paris Club Declaration and the 2008
the Accra Agenda for Action. JCPS partners27 decided in early 2009 that the strategy would be
developed in two phases. The first phase, completed in September 2009, focused on developing a
joint aid coordination strategy to improve aid effectiveness. The aid coordination strategy defines
shared principles and a common basis for actions to improve aid effectiveness. The shared
principles reflect the five underlying principles of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda that
are applicable to circumstances in Tajikistan. These principles will guide the delivery of aid to
Tajikistan and cooperation between the government and its development partners, both on a
bilateral basis and in extended multi-donor partnerships (Annex 5). The shared principles will be
applied through greater use of sector working groups, joint missions, and diagnostic reviews, and
development of a common arrangement for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring,
evaluation, and reporting on development partner activities and aid flows. The overall goal is
summarized as “One Strategy, One Coordination Mechanism, and One Monitoring and
Evaluation and Results Framework.” The second phase of donor cooperation efforts will focus
on identifying specific programs of joint donor assistance to support implementation of the
government’s PRS III.

27

The JCPS group has expanded to include: ADB, DFID, EC, Sweden, Switzerland, UN organizations (UNICEF,
UNDP, and WFP), USAID, and the WB. The Government of Tajikistan is represented by the Chairman of the State
Committee on Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM).

42

106. As mentioned above, the CPS has been designed with other development partners’
activities in mind (Table 6) and focuses in the sectors where the Bank Group has a longstanding engagement, a comparative advantage, and/or complementary global knowledge
and expertise. Taking into account of existing and planned activities of the JCPS partners, the
Bank Group will continue to focus on agriculture, energy, private sector development, water and
sanitation, and the social sectors. In agriculture and energy sectors, the Bank Group’s
involvement will build on existing engagements in response to client demand. In the private and
financial sectors, Bank Group activities will focus mostly on advisory services and technical
assistance in coordination with other JCPS partners. Activities in the social sectors will be scaled
up, as some JCPS partners have withdrawn interventions. In areas where other donors are highly
active, such as ADB’s strong engagement in the transport sector, the Bank Group’s involvement
will be limited.
107. The Bank Group will expand collaboration with new bilateral development
partners. These partners, including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, have
been increasing their development assistance to Tajikistan, thereby contributing to an overall
growth in aid flows to the country. These investments, sometimes significant, prompt for better
coordination and monitoring to ensure an efficient and effective division of labor. Specifically,
China provided US$281.2 million credit to finance the construction of the road connecting
Dushanbe and the northern part of Tajikistan. Two loans were contracted for the construction of
a North-South electricity transmission line (US$267.2 million) and Lolazor-Khatlon electricity
transmission lines (US$58.1 million). Russia invested US$480 million Ln hydropower
(Sangtuda I). Iran invested about US$200 million for construction of hydropower (Sangtuda II).
Recently, Russia has contributed to Bank-administered trust funds to address the food price crisis
and regional issues in Central Asia, especially education, migration, and blood safety.

108. The Bank Group has sought to strengthen its engagement with parliament, civil
society organizations (CSOs), the media, and the private sector. The aim of these efforts has
been to strengthen implementation effectiveness by involving a broad array of stakeholders with
a direct interest in the outcome of reforms, as well as to build awareness of the Bank Group’s
role in Tajikistan. IDA has involved local community groups in rehabilitating rural infrastructure
in their communities and CSOs in the monitoring of distribution of winter wheat seeds and
fertilizer to poor households. Implementation of reforms to the business-enabling environment
has been carried out in consultation with the private sector. The design of the CPS itself has
benefited from the input of a wide range of development partners (Box 4).
Box 4: Consultations on the Tajikistan CPS
In preparing the Tajikistan CPS, the Bank Group country team conducted a series of consultations with key
stakeholders in central and local government, parliament, the private sector, civil society organizations and the
media. Consultations were held during September 8-17, 2009, in the capital, Dushanbe, as well as in Kurgan
Tyube, Khujand, and Khorog. Due to postponement of the CPS Board date from November 2009 to May 25,
2010, the second round of consultations was held with the government on December 2009 and February 2010
(on the Bank’s involvement in hydropower development and the use of IDA crisis window) and with CSOs on
March 31, 2010 (on the revised CPS).
Overall, consulted groups expressed strong support for the CPS objectives, and the proposed program and
instruments. Government appreciated the emphasis on short-term initiatives to reduce the impact of the crisis
and endorsed the proposed program and instruments, especially during the first two years. Government
stakeholders also agreed on the proposed prioritization of agriculture, energy, private and financial sectors,
and social sectors over the medium term. Development partners agreed with the overall strategy and its
approach to governance and stressed the need to continue strengthening donor cooperation in the context of
the JCPS. Parliament called for improved collaboration even at the project level. Stakeholders in civil society
and the media expressed a preference for stronger transparency and accountability in the implementation of
Bank-financed projects and closer involvement of non-governmental organizations in implementation,
monitoring and evaluation through greater dissemination of information on WB activities in Tajikistan using
various communication channels. They raised concerns about the development of Rogun hydropower and
requested the Bank to work close with the government to ensure transparency of government operations and to
improve investment climate, and be (Annex 2).

V.

MANAGING RISKS

109. Macroeconomic. Implementation of the CPS could be delayed by a slow recovery in
Russia and other developed countries as well as not meeting the requirements under the
IMF ECF. Under this scenario, external demand for Tajikistan’s exports and migrant workers
would continue to weaken and further delay economic recovery. Macroeconomic stability would
be jeopardized if the government were to adopt an inappropriate policy framework to deal with a
deteriorating situation. According to the IMF latest assessment, continued sale of the Rogun
shares would undermine macroeconomic stability through reducing disposable incomes and
liquidity access, and increase quasi-fiscal deficit associated with SOEs’ subscription of the
Rogun’s equity shares. The Bank Group’s program, especially budget support under the PDPG,
could be brought into question.
Response: The Bank Group will work closely with the IMF in the context of the ECF
program to help maintain macroeconomic stability. In addition, the Bank will closely
45

monitor macroeconomic developments and budget implementation in collaboration with
the government. In case of unsatisfactory performance under the ECF program, the Bank
Group will scale up investment projects aimed at reducing vulnerabilities in the social
sector.
110. Delayed Reform. Weak government commitment to deeper reforms in productive
sectors could delay reforms envisaged under the CPS program. As the impact of the crisis
diminishes, the desire to implement difficult reforms may lessen in the face of strong resistance
from vested interests. This would slow much needed progress in expanding productive capacity
of agriculture, energy, and the private and financial sectors.
Response: The CPS has identified several steps to reduce the risk of delayed reform.
First, CGAC implementation will help highlight governance constraints in key sectors
and identify measures to address these constraints within Bank Group operations.
Second, the new PDPG series could include, as prior actions for obtaining budget
support, policy initiatives to reduce constraints to growth and poverty reduction. Under
the previous PDPG operation, delivered in 2009, inclusion of such prior actions
succeeded in accelerating policy reforms in agriculture and energy. Third, the Bank
Group will collaborate closely with JCPS partners to encourage the government to renew
its reform commitment. Finally, the CPS will concentrate on additional financing of
ongoing investment operations that have demonstrated a strong track record of
government commitment and development results.
111. Institutional capacity. Weak capacity and high turnover of key civil servants could
slow CPS implementation. Institutional deficiencies, unless addressed, could significantly
constrain the ability to formulate, implement and monitor the government’s program at the
national level. Such constraints would hamper the effectiveness of public service delivery,
especially social services that are vital for achievement of the MDGs. Weak capacity at the
project level could delay implementation of investments and exacerbate fiduciary risks, thus
hindering the achievement of expected CPS results.
Response: The CPS will emphasize follow-on investments in areas where prior
operations have yielded tangible results, building on capacity improvements that are
already underway. The Governance Checklist outlined in the CGAC strategy (Annex 4)
will be applied at the project design stage and again during mid-stream reviews in order
to ensure that individual projects address institutional capacity requirements and
individual technical capacity needs, and that sufficient funding is allocated for this
purpose.
112. Geo-political. The deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan
could result in an influx of refugees to Tajikistan. A surge of Afghan refugees would place a
heavy economic burden on Tajikistan and pose significant social problems, particularly in the
context of a global economic crisis. A security crisis on its periphery could lead the government
to divert attention away from its development agenda and reallocate resources at the expense of
its own population, a situation that could quickly lead to tensions within its own borders.

46

Response: This risk can be mitigated by closely monitoring inter-regional developments,
and adjusting the CPS implementation to these developments given the flexibility of CPS
instruments proposed. In addition, the Bank will continue working closely with
development partners in building donor and government’s capacity in risk management,
including the risks associated with disaster and emergency.

Annex 2: Country Partnership Strategy
(FY05-FY09) Completion Report
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
The Completion Report for the Tajikistan Country Partnership Strategy (FY05-FY09) is
drawn from inputs from the country team, available projects and AAAs. The Report is organized
into five sections. Following the introduction, the second section recounts the challenges the
country faced in 2004 and the strategies put in place to address them, including the CPS. The
third section reviews the evolution of key development outcomes and results expected from the
CPS program, identifying gaps between results attained and results expected. The fourth section
examines the performance of the Bank based on the CPR conducted in October 2008 undertaken
jointly with the ADB. The last section puts forth recommendations for the preparation of the next
Country Partnership Strategy for FY10-FY13.
2.
The rapid economic growth during the 2005-2008 CPS period contributed to poverty
alleviation and, aided by increasing public expenditure, reversed a negative trend in social
indicators. The global crisis, however, exposed the frailty of this growth, which had been driven
by remittances and favorable international commodity prices. A number of governance missteps
(among the most prominent was the mismanagement of the National Bank of Tajikistan under
the purported intent to finance cotton) brought into question the quality of national economic
stewardship and strained relations with the donor community.
3.
The ambitious CPS program, which had sought an across-the-board transformation of the
economy, produced mixed and uneven results. Progress was made when programs targeted welldefined outcomes and factored in capacity constraints through intensive AAA, well-designed
programs, and allow for time and dedication for policy dialogue and technical assistance
(examples of which include the liberalization of aviation and work in health and education). The
government placed high priority on exploiting the country’s energy potential and the electrical
interconnection of the region. Efforts to transform agriculture, however, were inadequate (reform
of the cotton sector, land restructuring and secured land use rights, irrigation), as have attempts
to modernize the state.
4.
A key lesson from this CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) is that an ambitious reform
agenda in the context of a weak institutional environment can easily overburden the authorities.
The result was dispersed and incomplete results that jeopardized the credibility of the initiatives.
Therefore, this review calls for greater realism in program design and adherence to strict
prioritization. This approach should assure a more timely delivery of coordinated results, and the
benefit of generating a virtuous cycle of reform. The Bank showed flexibility in delivering the
program during periods of unforeseen challenges (energy and food crises). It also maintained
delivery of the core program, especially the Programmatic Development Policy Operation
(PDPO) and AAAs. The CPS also delivered the expected level of financial support. Coordination
with other development partners improved.

II.

CHALLENGES AND STRATEGY

A. Background
5.
Tajikistan became independent in 1991. Internal conflict, however, delayed its transition
to a market economy. After the civil war ended in 1997, the government under President
Rahmon worked to establish state authority, concentrating on political consolidation and security
and rehabilitating and developing the war-torn country. Three years later, although much had
been accomplished, the economy was fragile with a per capita income of only US$310 for its 6.7
million inhabitants.
6.
Between 2000 and 2004 the economy grew by almost 60 percent, driven by an expansion
of services and construction fuelled by remittances and favorable world prices for country’s main
export commodities—aluminum and cotton. Good macroeconomic management helped bring
inflation down to 7 percent in 2004, stabilized the exchange rate, and reduced the debt burden by
restraining new borrowing and by restructuring agreements with bilateral creditors. External debt
to GDP dropped from 85 percent in 2002 to 40 percent at end-2004. Gross international reserves
increased to US$189 million at end-2004. Economic growth reduced the poverty rate from 81
percent in 1999 to 64 percent in 2003, (although regional differences remained significant,
ranging from 84 percent in Gorno-Badakhshan to 45 percent in Rayons of Republican
Subordinated, RRS).
B. Challenges (2004)
7.

The 2005 CPS identified three sets of challenges, which remain valid today.

8.
Daunting geography complicated by man-made barriers. The nearest port is found 2,000
kilometers away and high mountains separate Tajikistan from Kyrgyz Republic and China. In
addition, man-made restrictions limit access to Uzbekistan and the long-border with Afghanistan
raises security and drug trafficking concerns. Constraints to aviation further isolated the country.
9.
Major governance challenges due to a complex political economy. The government,
which had achieved the necessary political consolidation to establish security throughout the
country through a complex web of political agreements after the war, faced significant
governance challenges. The authorities confronted difficulties in transitioning towards a modern
government grounded on transparency and accountability. Governance challenges were
particularly troubling in the aluminum and cotton sectors. The opportunities and incentives for
corruption were high in a public administration with the structure and procedures inherited from
the Soviet system, beset by low public sector wages (around US$10 a month on average) and a
lack of accountability.
10.
Demography challenge. A rapidly growing population was exerting severe pressure on
service delivery, and, as a result, trends in school enrollment, child mortality, maternal mortality,
and HIV/AIDS prevalence appeared to be moving in the wrong direction. The challenge was
how to stem the decline in these indicators while retaining and expanding the human capital
inherited from the Soviet system.

58

C. Government Strategy
11.
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2002-2005) articulated the government’s
view of development and poverty reduction around four primary objectives:
To encourage equitable, labor-intensive economic growth, with an emphasis on exports.
To support the efficient and fair provision of basic social services.
To target support to the poorest groups of the population.
To improve governance and security.
12.
First, the government prioritized state-building efforts around public sector reform—to
improve administrative effectiveness and reduce corruption—and address critical governance
challenges in the management of state enterprises and cotton sector reform. Second, the
government foresaw a greater role for the private sector through continued privatization and a
lower regulatory burden on business. On rural development, the government envisioned sorting
out the cotton debt, continuing the farm land privatization program, improving competition in
farm inputs and cotton marketing, and rehabilitating irrigation infrastructure. Third, the
government placed a high priority on developing the country’s hydropower infrastructure for
electricity and aluminum exports as a strategic answer to Tajikistan’s geographical isolation.
Finally, the priority on health and education was to halt the deterioration of public service
delivery and to subsequently recover and come as close as possible to the MDG targets.
D. Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
13.
The Bank and the authorities met in Warsaw to agree on the key priorities of support. The
dialogue emphasized selectivity (given the limited IDA resources) and maintaining the growth
trend, while preparing the country for sustained growth over the longer term. The partners
identified three strategic objectives for the CPS: (a) improve business opportunities in rural and
urban areas; (b) preserve and enhance the quality of health and education; and (c) improve the
delivery of energy services and exploit the country’s hydropower potential. IFC participated
actively at the Warsaw discussions and in the preparation of the CPS and took leadership of
improving the business environment and facilitating access to credit.
14.
Efforts to improve national governance and reduce corruption through strengthening of
the state’s institutional capacity were designed to support the three pillars. The CPS relied on an
on-going program covering most of the result agenda. In addition, it introduced a DPO series of
three operations to lead the policy dialogue with the authorities and help finance the budget. The
CPS design was relevant to the government priorities and addressed the challenges facing the
country. However, its scope was ambitious in light of the limited capacity of the government to
implement the program and the limited IDA resources.
E. Risks
15.
The strategy document pointed to external risks related to potential spillovers from a
tense regional situation in Afghanistan, the volatile Fergana Valley, and the drug trade. In
addition, the CPS identified two likely sources of external economic shocks: (a) a decline in
remittances from Russia, and (b) a fall in the world prices for aluminum or cotton. Lastly, the
59

CPS was concerned that IDA and other donors may not be able to generate a level of support
sufficient to fund even a narrow set of development challenges given that other development
partners allocated resources based on the country’s performance.
16.
As major internal risks, the CPS saw the limited implementation capacity and weak
governance, and the likely complacency in the face of an improving external environment. Given
Tajikistan's fragile economic and social setting, the CPS noted that any slackening of the reform
effort, related to governance (state owned enterprise accountability, cotton, and energy sectors),
would risk recent gains and would make the CPS goals unattainable. Lastly, the CPS alluded to
potential instability arising from a growing and youthful population.
III.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

17.
The analysis of results begins with a brief overview of the broad national development
outcomes relevant to the CPS program. Subsequently, it provides a detailed discussion of the
CPS program with emphasis on results from the program and, as possible, its contribution to
development outcomes.
A. Development Outcomes
18.
The level of poverty has decreased but remains high, especially in rural areas.
Preliminary findings from the 2007 Tajikistan Livings Standards Survey (TLSS) indicate that
economic growth and remittances improved the livings standards of the Tajik population since
2003, when the rate of poverty incidence stood at 64 percent. The same survey shows that
remittances accounted for around 17 percent of the disposable household income on average and
contributed to poverty reduction more than social transfers, which account for only 2 percent of
disposable income. Still, by the end of 2007, 41 percent of the population was poor and 17
percent was extremely poor.28 In addition, considerable income volatility in rural areas, where 72
percent of the poor live, exposes its population to periodic deeper drops in consumption. About
50 percent of the poor are working poor, meaning that labor market participation does not reduce
the risk of falling into poverty.
19.
The economy grew rapidly. From 2004 to 2008 the economy grew on average at an
annual rate of 8 percent. Remittances and increasing public expenditure drove demand. Supply
was relatively elastic, given that private investment remained low (around 7 percent of GDP
which is scarcely above 5.1 percent in 2003.) Increases in the domestic supply of goods relied for
the most part on existing capacity. Public investment as a share of GDP (increasing from 8.1
percent in 2004 to 14.1 percent in 2007) was driven by electricity investments. In 2009, with the
backdrop of the global recession, fears of an economic slowdown have materialized.
20.
Availability of resources to the public sector increased considerably. The resources
available to the government to finance its expenditures increased on account of (a) the rapid rate
of growth of GDP; (b) the increase in the ratio of domestic revenue to GDP from 17.3 percent in
2004 to 20.5 percent in 2007; and (c) external assistance. Public expenditure jumped from 20.3
28

The 2007 WB poverty estimate applies the 2003-2007 rate of per-capita income growth to the 2003 household
survey data.

60

percent in 2004 to 27.6 percent of GDP in 2007. The government increased (a) financing of
social sectors, (b) wages and salaries of public officials, and (c) public investment.
21.
But the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated since 2007. Inflation was
exacerbated—the rate of inflation rose from 5.1 percent in 2004 to 19.8 in 2007. Concurrently,
the external position of the economy deteriorated as the current account deficit moved up from 4
percent in 2004 to 9.5 percent of GDP in 2007 and unencumbered foreign exchange reserves fell
to slightly above US$100 million at the end of 2007. The domestic cotton debt problem, the
international financial crisis, and the declining liquidity of commercial banks have weakened the
stability of the financial sector. The frail position of the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) has
reduced the scope for monetary policy.
22.
The perception of the quality of governance has worsened. Tajikistan’s CPIA in 2008
remained the same as that of 2004 (3.2, at the bottom of the IDA ECA scale). Governance proper
within the CPIA (property rights, public expenditure management, public administration,
transparency and revenue) remained static at 2.6. Only social sectors showed an improvement
from 3.0 (2004) to 3.4 in (2008). While governance might not have deteriorated during the
period, the cracks became more evident and are affecting the credibility of the state. The
developments at the Central Bank concerning the non-transparent provision of guarantees and
loans to KreditInvest and cotton investors and the lack of proper accounting and the absence of
internal controls at the NBT are clear example of the governance shortcomings. These concerns
extend to other areas such as the management of public funds, and the handling of large public
enterprises, where improvements in governance have also been hard to come by.
23.
Tajikistan faces the emerging crisis from a very weak position. Despite the rapid rate of
economic growth and rising public revenues, structural reforms in key strategic sectors have
been slowly implemented. Today, the government is in a weak position to face the current crisis:
remittances have dropped, prices for cotton and aluminum products are lower, and it faces a
substantive loss in credibility resulting from the mismanagement of the cotton farm debt.
B. Results from CPS Interventions
Pillar I: Foster broad based growth in urban and rural areas
24.
Under this pillar, the CPS supported actions to remove institutional barriers to economic
growth. The strategy envisaged the development of a highly competitive investment climate as
the compensating factor for the extreme isolation of the country. In addition, the strategy
emphasized the development of agriculture, as the majority of the population, in particular the
poor, live in rural areas. The pillar defined two sets of results clusters around:
x
x

Improving the business climate and access to finance
Improving the competitiveness of agriculture.

25.
To help achieve the objectives, the World Bank Group drew on a wide range of
instruments; most notably the three operations under the Programmatic Development Policy
Grant (PDPG), several operations in support of agricultural reform, IFC through technical
assistance, availability of credit lines to finance small and medium enterprises and a series of
analytical notes in support of the policy dialogue. The following paragraphs take stock of the
61

results achieved. A key lesson that emerges is that in a weak institutional environment major
efforts are needed to set the basis for progress and that initial change can be slow.

26.
IDA has led the dialogue to improve governance and competition in aviation through the
PDPG series. A new institutional architecture for the aviation sector has separated policy making
from technical regulation and from operations. The government adopted a resolution to
restructure Tajik State Airlines by end 2008, leading to separation of airlines, airports, and air
tariff control. These reforms have improved access and safety and the expectation is that they
will lower costs as well. This hard-won progress illustrates how time and effort can pay off in
building capacity and institutions.
27.
IFC and IDA have supported simplification of business inspections and licensing. PDPG
dialogue and IFC support have helped achieve significant results in both inspections and taxation
reform. To implement the 2006 Law on inspections, the IFC supported amendments to more than
20 laws, regulations, and instructions to comply with the Law. In 2008, the IFC assisted in the
adoption and implementation of a simplified tax reporting system for individual entrepreneurs. In
addition, WBG support was behind the adoption of the July 2006 law “On Inspections” and
legislative and regulatory changes needed for its implementation. Reportedly the number of
activities subject to licensing has been reduced from 1,500 to about 113; new rules and
procedures have been established to reduce arbitrariness.
28.
Access to financial services has improved, but the gains are at risk. By June 2008 credit
to the private sector was estimated at 20.7 percent, compared to 14.4 percent of GDP in 2005.
Banking assets have increased rapidly from 11 percent of GDP in 2005 to 25.3 percent at the end
of 2007. Microfinance institutions have grown in number and types and now serve 50,000
clients. Lending by micro-credit organizations grew by 200 percent in 2006 and a further 80
percent in the first half of 2007, but the sector remains small with a portfolio of US$37 million.
Still, high interest rates, lack of long-term sources of funding, a weak secure lending framework,
and accounting and auditing shortcomings remain formidable barriers to improved access to
62

finance. Not surprisingly, the 2010 Doing Business places “Getting Credit” in Tajikistan 167
among 183 economies. Recently, the financial sector is coming under stress from the forced
lending from the government to commercial banks to on-lend to the cotton sector, now up to 19
percent of the banking sector capital (April 2009.) The likely effects of the global crisis on the
banking sector represent an additional risk factor, even if the banking system appears well
capitalized and non-performing loans are at 7.9 percent in June 2009. The gains of the last four
years are at risk.

IFC actively supported financial sector development. During FY05-09, IFC committed a
total of US$23.0 million in 8 projects in Tajikistan’s financial sector. Of this amount, US$6.3
million was provided to First Microfinance Bank of Tajikistan (FMBT) support their
microfinance IFC also provided a $2.5 million trade finance line to Eskhata Bank (under the
Global Trade Finance Facility). To increase microfinance lending, IFC provided US$3 million to
FMBT and to IMON to support their microfinance lending operations. In addition, IFC provided
a US$2.5 million trade finance line to Eskhata Bank (under the Global Trade Finance Facility).
IFC also invested US$10 million in Aureos Central Asia fund, which will invest in SMEs in the
region. In addition, IFC’s role in the development and growth of financial services in Tajikistan
includes specific advisory services to financial institutions on agricultural financing, and the
leasing market. Its portfolio across all financial institutions grew by 860 percent during 20062008, reaching US$21.7 million. IFC South Tajikistan Cotton Lending Project’s partner financial
institutions saw their cotton portfolio reaching 95 percent repayment, much higher than the
national cotton portfolio repayment rate. The support of the IFC Central Asia Mortgage Market
Development Project helped draft the Mortgage Law of the Republic of Tajikistan (2008), which
allows banks to start mortgage operations; IFC is providing TA to develop the needed skills. The
IFC Corporate Governance Project has increased knowledge and training capacity on Corporate
Governance, along with consultations on Board structures and requirements to companies in both
the financial and real sectors.
30.
The available evidence shows a mixed picture in the quality of the business climate, with
some successes. IFC SME Survey results reveal improvements in the prevalence of some
administrative procedures from 2005 to 2007. Fewer SMEs were inspected in 2007 than in 2005,
reflecting good implementation efforts of the 2006 Inspections Law. The 2006 Inspections Law
and its implementation resulted in annual savings to the Tajik SME sector of $9.3 million in
direct and indirect costs. The percentage of SMEs that report obtaining a permit also dropped
significantly, particularly for dekhan farms. The government undertook comprehensive reform of
63

the licensing regime with the 2004 Licensing Law, and fewer small and medium companies and
dekhan farms report obtaining a license in 2007 than in 2005.
31.
Challenges remain to implement and expand business environment reforms. 2010 Doing
Business, IFC SME Survey, and 2008 BEEPS continue to report many impediments to doing
business in the country. The 2010 Doing Business ranks Tajikistan 152 among 183 countries (an
improvement from 2009 when it was 164). The ranking of some categories improved, for
example protecting investors ranked 73 and enforcing contracts ranked high at 39. Starting a
business ranked 143 and registering a property ranked 78. Overall, entry (creating companies)
and obtaining construction permits appears to be difficult. Such barriers can easily negate efforts
that have been made to increase competition through amendments to the competition law and to
the law of natural monopolies. Operating a business is difficult as underscored by the rankings:
(a) taxation (162), (b) trading across borders (179), (c) getting credit (167), and (d) employing
workers (143.). The IFC SME Survey shows that certification procedures for products and
services are more prevalent; the main administrative procedure requirements for SMEs in
Tajikistan impose direct costs of approximately $18 million per year.
32.
Information from the 2008 BEEPS survey confirms that most firms in Tajikistan
continued to face hurdles in all fronts. These findings should concern the Bank, IFC and other
donors that have been working hard on areas such as business licensing and permits, business
inspections, access to credit, competition, and electricity.
33.
A strategy is in place to foster private sector development, the present crisis provides the
opportunity to speed up implementation and increase the supply response of the economy. At the
request of the government, IDA in close collaboration with IFC and other donors developed a
Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy in March 2007. Implementation of the strategy
started slowly but the pace has picked up in 2009. The renewed effort is welcome given the
limited participation of the private sector in the economy-- around 55 percent29--despite the
implementation of the 2004-2007 Privatization Plan which transferred around 500 medium and
large enterprises to the private sector. In the present environment, the chances for further
privatization are low. Emphasis should be on fostering the entry of new enterprises and the
growth of existing firms.
Reform and performance in agriculture continue to lag.
34.
Bank support for agriculture has been guided by the dual objectives of assisting the
government (a) develop policies for sustainable agriculture growth; and (b) resolve the cotton
crisis. The CPS targeted results in the agriculture sector was highly relevant because the majority
of the population and the poor live in the agriculture sector that underperformed the rest of the
economy since 2003 and because cotton utilizes around three-fourth of irrigated land. Various
factors have constrained the cotton sector growth including slow progress in issuing land use
certificates, weak price incentives for cotton farmers from a group of non-competitive and
closely held ginneries, continued state management of production targets,30 and difficult access
29

On paper, freedom to farm exists. On 5 March 2007, the President signed Decree #111 Action Plan (Road Map)
for the Implementation of the Farm Debt Resolution Strategy in the Republic of Tajikistan for 2007-2009, provided

to finance. The high and mounting debts of cotton farmers to a select group of input suppliers
were further crippling the sector.

35.
Bank AAA supported preparation of an Agriculture Sector Strategy in 2007. This strategy
identified land titling and resolution of the cotton crisis as priorities. The strategy gave way to a
Roadmap, which the government adopted in 2007 through a Presidential Decree 111 and later
decree 313 in 2008. However, progress in reform was minimal, thus, affecting the
implementation of the Bank’s assistance program and the delivery of expected results. On May
30, 2009, the government announced a Presidential decree related to cotton debt resolution and
in July 2009 approved an action plan to write off cotton debt owed by farmers to ginners and
commercial banks.
36.
The objective of a more competitive cotton market has not been met, but partial gains
have been made. The Bank has pursued a dialogue on cotton grading standard and export
licensing through the PDPG series and the Cotton Sector Recovery Project.31 Recent
achievements include deregulating the grading of cotton and lifting licensing of cotton exports
by the NBT in late 2008, so the barriers in the cotton sector were in place during most of the CPS
period. Most importantly, the production target for cotton farming remained mandatory
throughout this period. However, the authorities have reduced the area under mandatory
cultivation by 50,000 hectares (around 25 percent of the total area) for the on-going season.
Forcing cotton production has weakened reform efforts. For instance, opening to competition in
ginning with the idea of bringing in foreign investment has not delivered expected results as
potential investors are driven away by the present uncertainties. Implementation of the Cotton
Sector Recovery Project has been slow and has been restructured.
for freedom to farm without Government interference. However, slow implementation means that even non-cotton
farms must report on the acreage used for each crop, herd numbers, etc. In the Dairy sector, government control has
lead to low levels of production of fodder crops, reduced fodder available for milk cows, and therefore lower
production of milk.
31

The Cotton Sector Recovery Project was effective September 2007.

65

37.
Financing cotton has given rise to several governance failures. The Cotton Sector
Recovery Project sought to address the cotton debt and proposed a mechanism to do so. This
came to naught, and unbeknownst to the public; the NBT extended loans to and guaranteed
foreign borrowing by private investors under the assumption that they would finance farmers. As
investors defaulted on their obligations the NBT took on their debt, affecting its capital and net
reserve position. The recent audit of the NBT (March, 2009) pointed to a number of deficiencies
and questioned the involvement of the NBT in cotton financing. While this involvement stopped
as of 2008, the Ministry of Finance lends funds to commercial banks to on-lend to cotton farmers
(in 2008) and for the agricultural sector (2009), thereby engendering a problem for the banks or
further fiscal costs.
38.
Titling of the land is behind schedule due to lack of political will especially in cotton
areas. Efforts to advance land titling through the Land Registration and Cadastre System for
Sustainable Agriculture Project have fallen short of expectations and only 509 land certificates
had been issued as of the September 2008 midterm review. Recently, there has been some
acceleration and as of end April 2009 a cumulative total of 2,488 certificates had been issued.
The mid-term review of the project suggested lowering the final target to 37,500 certificates
rather than 75,000 as in the original project document and to focus attention on removing
institutional barriers to the introduction of a land-property system. The multi-donor dialogue is
helping improve the legal framework as the Land Code limits the government’s discretion to
revoke land rights without fair compensation and due process was amended in early 2008. In
addition, a new law has been approved for the creation of a unified registration system. Overall,
while progress towards a modern legal framework for land has been incomplete and at times
contradictory, it has nevertheless taken important steps forward with CPS support.
39.
The tardiness in titling is delaying improvements in irrigation. Bank support for building
irrigation institutions came through a pilot supported by the Fergana Valley Project. Lack of
proper titling slowed down implementation, specifically the creation of water user associations.
The already established water user associations in the pilot areas worked with local governments
to issue land titles so that irrigation infrastructure could be rehabilitated. This fact reinforced the
findings of IEG’s Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Farm Privatization
Support Project (FPSP) that efforts at improving and manage infrastructure are less sustainable
in the absence of clear property rights.32 It downgraded the outcome’s rating of the FPSP from
satisfactory to moderately satisfactory. In addition, IEG’s review of the Rural Infrastructure
Rehabilitation Project downgraded the project outcomes from moderately unsatisfactory to
unsatisfactory, showing the difficulties in improving infrastructure in an institutional weak
environment. Lastly, the fact that agriculture is performing better outside of cotton areas,
suggesting that farmers respond to market incentives.
40.
IFC is the only IFI that has remained substantially engaged at a grassroots level in the
cotton sector. The Farmers Ownership Model that forms, trains and empowers farmer-owned
32

The FPSP, concluded in 2004, help privatize 10 collective farms, rehabilitate infrastructure and create nine user
associations have assumed water distribution to members collecting fees for their services. Also it helped issue 6000
titles. An IEG PPAR for the FPSP noted that while the repair needs for irrigation had been carefully assessed under
the project, in the absence of cropping freedom, access to free markets , etc. the farms were unlikely to maintainedrepaired systems.

66

finance cooperatives has produced results on the ground. SugdAgroServe (SAS), the recipient of
IFC support, currently has more than 1,080 member shareholders (from 400 shareholders at the
beginning) and a loan portfolio of over US$1.15 million that finances a variety of crops and
livestock. Through its retail business, SAS provides high quality fertilizers, crop protection
products, seeds and machinery. The marketing division ensures that farmers receive the best
possible price for their crops. SAS is now operating independently without IFC Advisory
Services support. This experience allowed IFC to launch the South Tajikistan Cotton Lending
Project that partners with banks to introduce commercially viable loan products tailored to
financing cotton production (average loan size is $20,000). The project now works with two IFC
investment client banks that have expanded their lending portfolio to small and medium sized
cotton farmers from almost zero to $2.7 million over 2 years. Through both the South Tajikistan
Cotton Lending Project and IFC support for SAS, IFC approved more than $7 million in loans
for the cotton sector, covering nearly 6,500 hectares.
41.
In addition, the Agribusiness Supply Chain project that began implementation from 2007
has provided more than 300 hours of consultations to 100 farms and 20 organizations. The
results are tangible: demonstrated increases of at least 8 percent in milk production at the larger
dairy farms. Outreach on farmers’ rights has also been successful with farms taking independent
decisions to expand fodder crops by 5-10 percent. The project has been very successful at the
farmer level but has encountered challenges in establishing a strong anchor client around which
to build a supply chain.
First pillar contribution to long-term outcomes
42.
The Bank program under this pillar was to help the country prepare for the long-term by
removing critical barriers to private sector economy activity. By this account the impact of the
program has been subdued, although there is a fair amount of work in progress. The salient
outcome is the reform of the aviation sector that is already having an impact. Towards the end of
the CPS the government introduced some reforms on cotton—lifting the exporting licenses and
reforming the cotton grading process. However, there is evidence that mandatory cotton farming
is still in place, even if the area under cultivation is going down. The financing of cotton gave
rise to considerable governance missteps that have damaged the credibility of the nation, and that
will require fiscal resources to capitalize the NBT. Even today, financing cotton from the budget
through the banking system carries both fiscal and financial risks given the relatively low rate of
repayment of loan obligations. Now that the legal background is in place, land titling could take
off during the next strategy (assuming adequate government commitment), setting a basis for
rapid improvement in irrigation and increased investment in rural areas. During this CPS, land
titling and irrigation recovery has fallen below expectations. The work of IFC and IDA in search
of a better business environment is on-going, contributing to the modernization of the framework
for permits, tax administration, licensing and inspections. Intensive work to develop and
implement the Inspections Law by IFC has led to the development of inspection checklists,
enabling regulations in inspectorates, and training for all inspectors in the two pilot inspectorates.
The focus on implementation has yielded results in decreasing the coverage of inspections,
number of inspections, and duration of inspections, yielding cost savings for the private sector of
US$9.3 million. Tax administration has been identified by SMEs as a constraint in IFC SME
Surveys. In 2008, IFC implemented a simplified taxation regime for individual entrepreneurs
(patent) which has also yielded cost savings of US$2 million to SMEs. However, the low level of
67

private investment raises questions about the pace and scope of deregulation, and whether the
on-going pace suits an increasingly difficult external environment. Analytical work should
inform rapid and coherent actions to trigger a fast supply response in this time of crisis.
Pillar II: Preserve and enhance the quality of health and education
43.
Under this pillar the CPS supported government efforts to reverse the negative trends in
health and education induced by the lack of financing and deteriorating delivery systems. The
government program committed to turn the situation around by increasing budgetary allocations
to the health and education sectors (which had gone down respectively to 0.9 and 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2004), and modernize institutions to increase coverage and efficiency. The aim was to
improve the likelihood of delivering on the Millennium Development Goals. The CPS results can
be grouped in two results packages:
x
x

Improving the health of the population
Improving education for the population

Improve health of the population.
Results Expected Under the CPS
Improved access to and quality of health services,
as measured by (i) increased utilization of
primary health care by children and women of
childbearing age, (ii) increased immunization
coverage rates, and (iii) increased number of
trained family doctors in areas covered by the
IDA program
Increased patient satisfaction with health services
in areas supported by IDA programs as measured
by surveys
Progressive reallocation of public health
spending from hospitals to primary health care

More equitable financing of health services, both
in primary health care (through per capita
financing) and hospitals (through basic benefit
package implementation)

Reduced the growth rate of HIV prevalence
among identified intravenous drug users,
commercial sex workers, prisoners, migrants, and
out of school unemployed youths.
Increased consumption of safe water in Dushanbe
and selected municipalities in Tajikistan, to be
measured by: (a) increased consumption of safe
water in liters per capita; (b) quality measured by
meeting WHO/national standards

68

44.
The Bank program supporting health was relevant, but the lack of a comprehensive
strategy complicated implementation. The Bank instruments have been a Community and Basic
Health Project (CBHP), and a sector investment grant co-financed by SIDA. In addition, a
regional operation financed work on HIV/AIDS. The Bank project supported development and
pilot implementation of (a) primary health system financed with capitation grants, and (b) a basic
benefits package. The pilot approach took account of the capacity limitations in the country.
Regretfully, during implementation lack of a comprehensive health strategy created duplication
and fragmentation from piecemeal intervention of players in multiple PIUs. The government and
development partners are now working towards a comprehensive strategy.
45.
The poor have better access to health services in the regions of Bank support. The
preliminary results from the 2007 Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS) report
improvements in the access to health services by the poor. For Sogd and Khatlon oblasts (where
the seven rayons the Bank project is working with are located), the percentage of the households
that do not seek access to health services because they cannot afford them dropped to 29 and 37
percent respectively from a 2003 baseline of 57 percent. In turn, the share of health in household
expenditure has dropped from a baseline of 9 percent to 4.8 and 3.1 percent respectively in these
two oblasts.
46.
The implementation of the strategy has achieved definite progress in the introduction of
per-capita financing in primary health care: the per capita financing system has been designed
and piloted. The legal/regulatory framework for implementing the first phase of the Public
Health Care Centers financing reforms is in place. The provisions include, amongst others, (a)
consolidation of the PHC at the rayon level; (b) separation of hospital and PHC budgets; (c)
increased autonomy of PHC facilities, (d) separate execution, control and reporting of per capita
health budgets, and (e) separate information systems. The per capita financing (capitation)
program is under implementation in two oblast that cover 60 percent of the population. However,
currently per capita allocation of funds is done on a district level, while the largest disparity in
public expenditure is observed among districts and regions. In the next phase of reform, it is
envisioned to redistribute health public funds for primary health care at the regional level (i.e.,
pool the fund at regional level).
47.
Progress with the implementation of the Basic Benefit Package (BBP) is somewhat
mixed. The BBP has proven an effective tool for converting a large share of out-of-pocket
payments into legal payments; however, the broad coverage of the benefit package and the
inefficiencies of the service delivery make the package unsustainable given the limited resources
the state assigns to health. In September 2008, government redefined the basic package structure
to help financial sustainability; a pilot to implement these ideas is underway in eight rayons. The
PDPG operations supported these reforms.
48.
AIDS awareness improves. Tajikistan has received around 30 percent of the small grants
allocated under the Central Asia AIDS project during the first and the second cycles, which
exceeded original expectations. The grants helped to increase AIDS awareness as was intended.
Preliminary results show that knowledge of HIV prevention increased from 43 percent of
respondents in the relevant age group in 2005 to 57.5 percent in 2007. However, it is still below
the PSRP set for 2009—75 percent.
69

49.
Partial improvements in safe water availability in Dushanbe have taken place. The
quality of safe water in Dushanbe has improved despite a slow start and protracted
implementation of the supporting Dushanbe Water Project. With the rehabilitation of the daily
sedimentation pond and installation of pumps, the quality of the water in the supply network of
Dushanbe has improved, with turbidity remaining low even on rainy days. 75 percent of the
population now receives continuous, 24-hour service; more than 65 percent of the population
now receives water with low turbidity as compared to 52 percent in 2003. Outside, water
availability is improving in the 8 towns participating in the Municipal Infrastructure
Development Project (FY06). A recent impact assessment under the project shows that water
availability has increased by 20 percent.
Improve education of the population.

50.
The Bank education program was relevant to the government priorities that were well
articulated in a comprehensive strategy. The government, jointly with stakeholders, has put
forth a National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) that is guiding program design and
implementation towards the medium term. Bank support has come through the Education
Modernization Project (EMP) predating the CPS; the Bank has also helped coordinate approval
and is implementing an EFA/FTI financed project. Both projects are focused on improving
access and quality from grades 1-11 and strengthening education institutions. In addition, the
EFA/FTI is contributing to donor harmonization with the government. The authorities recently
developed and approved a better prioritized and costed strategy as part of the preparation for FTI
3.
51.
Attendance and completion rates are up in areas of Bank project implementation; also in
these areas the bases have been set for improving the quality of the service. In the seven rayons
covered by the Education Modernization Project, enrollment is close to 100 percent and
completion rates are at 99.85 percent. Nationwide, the TLSS estimates school attendance at
about 95 percent, although quality of education is an issue. To address quality, the government,
70

with donor support, has been undertaking various activities: (a) new curriculum framework for
two primary education subjects has been developed and distributed nationally; (b) 300 teachers
with secondary education have been trained in the pilot areas; (c) fourth grade assessment has
been developed and pilot tested; and (d) refurbishing of the basic textbooks with 50 new titles
complete. One hundred percent of schools in pilot rayons have functioning Parent Teacher
Associations (PTAS) and 416 Parent Teacher Associations have been created. In the targeted
rayons, 132 schools buildings have been rehabilitated.
52.
Progress in implementing education per capita financing has exceeded expectations.
Per-capita funding of schools is the centerpiece for rationalizing resource utilization in the
education sector. The progress here has gone beyond CPS expectations, with per-capita funding
in 12 rayons rather than one and plans underway to expand nationwide based on the findings of
an evaluation of the results thus far.
53.
Going forward the priority should be given to protecting and consolidating the gains that
have been made. These include: national rollover of pilot experience, institutionalization of per
capital financing and school autonomy, engagement of the community, curriculum up-grading
and teacher training. Achievement of results expected under the CPS was aided by realistic
design, commitment of government, and increased capacity at the education ministry. The NSED
continues to provide the framework for the EFA/FTI funding and the forthcoming SWAp. The
2008 BEEPS Tajikistan preliminary results point to lack of skilled personnel as one of the major
constraints to business. Brief and pointed analytical work can delve in greater detail to identify
the nature of this limitation, and help inform the government and development community on
ways to address it.
Second pillar contribution to development outcomes
54.
The objectives set by the CPS under the second pillar were realistic and have been met
for the most part, although improvements in water availability (mostly Dushanbe) have been
slow to come. Downward trends in health and education indicators seem to have been halted;
definite information will be available with the final publication of TLSS. In water, the situation
is less clear. Preliminary information from the TLSS suggests the percentage of households
having access to safe water remains the same as 2003. The compatibility between project
information and general survey results needs to be examined.
55.
Overall, the situation in health, education and the availability of potable water remains
dire, with country indicators lagging the region by far. The on-going crisis puts at risk the gains
that have been achieved. These can be protected by maintaining funding levels, including the
salaries of teachers and health personnel so that service delivery units can remain open. In
addition, the partners should forge ahead with components that have been tested successfully,
like per capita financing in education and health. The challenge will be to maintain the levels of
investment. For instance, in education, the Multi-cluster Assessment survey finds that the quality
of school and health facilities are still not appropriate, especially when it comes to functioning
properly in winter conditions.

71

Pillar III: Improve delivery of energy services and exploit the country’s hydropower potential
56.
The authorities set a high priority on developing the energy potential of the country,
which already contributed five percent to GDP and was a critical direct input into the production
of aluminum and indirectly into cotton through irrigation. The CPS strategy centered on
improving governance, financial performance, and quality of service delivery in the internal
markets. With a longer term perspective in mind, the CPS focused on helping build the basis for
Tajikistan to supply regional electricity markets. The main instruments of assistance have been
the Energy Loss and Recovery project (which is half way through implementation), the Pamir
Private Power project (close to completion), and dialogue around the preparation of a regional
project to complete the interconnections. Emergencies made it necessary to provide additional
financing for Pamir and a self-standing operation (Emergency Energy Assistance project) to help
with the effects of the harsh winter of 2007-08 (among which was a drastic drop in electricity)
and to improve the country’s readiness in dealing with future emergencies. The DPO series has
taken on the policy dialogue.

57.
The quasi-fiscal deficit of the energy sector has been reduced, but by less than expected.
The CPS sought to help the government reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with public
enterprise activity, especially energy. The strategy combined tariff realignment, improved
collection and management improvements in the state companies. Progress includes bringing gas
sector tariffs to the cost recovery ahead of the original target date (2010). Collection rates in gas
and electricity are well above targets. The 2008 quasi-fiscal deficit stands at 12 percent, well
below the level of 15 percent in 2004. However, the contribution of internal funds to finance
investment is below the 30 percent target, as servicing debt with China to finance the
construction of the transmission line connecting the country from north to south has reduced the
availability of internal resources. The country is on track to improve the finances of the sector,
but must accelerate investments to meter consumption and reduce losses.
58.
Progress in improving corporate governance at Barki-Tajik has been slow. Although
delayed, an audit of Barki-Tajik is now available. And because the auditors lacked proper
information on financial accounts, the audit is incomplete. Overall, concerns with the governance
of BT continue to linger and are shared by the authorities and development partners. The urgency
remains to bring to international levels governance in BT so that the company can play a central
role in the ambitious regional program.
59.
A more prolonged and bitter cold season than had been the norm and a low water level at
the main dam created a dire situation during the 2007/2008 winter. The Bank fielded an
emergency operation that became effective almost a year after Board approval, an indication that
the country is not adequately prepared to address risks in a timely manner. While the Bank
helped address the energy crisis, electricity remains a major constraint to business and
production in general, especially during the winter months (2008-BEEPS). In addition, results
from the recent Multi-Cluster Assessment survey (October 2008) show that households remain at
risk due to lack of fuel at hand or resources to purchase it when needed.
60.
The regional electricity interconnection agenda is roughly on track. The electricity interconnection line, built with the support from the Republic of China, is designed to connect the
south and the north of the country. This will break the interdependency with Uzbekistan, which
now operates the electricity grid control center it inherited from Soviet times. This
interconnection will not only help connect the country but eventually the region (Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan) once complementary investments (CASA 1000, financed
by IDA and others) link regional markets are completed, possibly as early as 2013. In the
meantime, RAO UES of Russia provided financing and completed the construction of Sangtuda
1, which helps reduce domestic energy shortages and generate summer surpluses for sale to
neighbors—possibly Afghanistan. Iran is financing the construction of Sangtuda II.
61.
Institutional upgrading of the water sector has moved slowly. The initial design of the
Dushanbe Water Supply Project envisaged private sector management and participation through
contract management; ultimately, this did not prove politically feasible. The project has been
managed by the local water company under the Mayor’s office. Tariff increases and better
collection practices have raised the ratio of collected revenues to the sum of operational costs,
adequate maintenance, and project related expenses from 21 percent in 2002 to 65 percent in the
first nine months of 2008. Improvements have been made in the finances of the companies
through upward water tariff readjustments and better collection practices, which are feasible now
73

that the quality of the service has improved. Still, the governance of the water company remains
a concern and is hindering other development partners from making sizeable financial
contributions needed to carry out the necessary investments, which IDA cannot cover given the
available envelope. In addition, the Municipal Infrastructure Development Project (FY06) has
the objective of increasing institutional capacity at the central agency responsible for municipal
services in small towns outside of Dushanbe and Khodjand. Progress has been slow given the
weak institutional capacity and, as a result, the financial and institutional performance of KMK
has not yet improved significantly.
Pillar Three: contribution to long-term objectives
62.
The poor quality of energy supply for the domestic market continues to constrain
production and has the potential to significantly limit the supply response in the short to
medium-term. It is likely that the country will remain vulnerable for some time, especially if
procuring regional supplies of energy continues to be difficult. Governance remains a concern
for energy and water. In energy, it has (and may continue to) affect the willingness of sound and
credible international partners to invest in the government’s ambitious plans to be a regional
player in energy. The lack of transparency at TALCO remains a concern as the country; in fact,
the firm did not benefit from high world aluminum prices during the past several years due to a
questionable tolling arrangement. The current drop in international prices is affecting the
company’s profitability, raising fiscal risks related to lower tax contributions. Good progress has
been made in developing the regional energy market, which augurs well (for now) given such an
ambitious undertaking. However, further large hydro investments will require attention on
account of geopolitical risks and the need to improve the investment climate to attract the large
foreign investment necessary for its construction.
Underpinning the strategic objectives: Improve governance and state capacity
63.
The spirit of the CPS was for the governance work to help all pillars deliver their
expected results. Hence, governance work was conceived as complementary to the achievement
of the CPS results and not as an objective in itself. Within the resulting broad governance
agenda, the Bank focused the bulk of its support on building the capacity of the central
government as the backbone of a long-term strategy to address the constraints. The main
components have been (a) public expenditure reform, (b) fiduciary reform, and (c) public
administration and civil service reforms. Bank support has come through policy dialogue under
the DPO, the Public Administration Reform Project, analytical work (Programmatic Public
Expenditure Review (PPER), and Public Sector Pay Policy Note) and the National Statistical
Capacity Building Project.

64.
The government brought all of its development strategies under a single umbrella—PRSP
2007. The government met its commitment to consolidate all existing development strategies at
the time the CPS was approved under a single framework, the National Development Strategy
(NDS 2006-2015). In 2006, it produced a second and more comprehensive PRSP (2007-2009).
The strategic integration would help facilitate development of a single budget and the alignment
between budgetary allocations and national objectives. Already, the allocation of resources to
health and education has increased in line with national priorities and preliminary expenditure
tracking for health and education has been undertaken. Given the various crises that have
occurred since 2007, the bulk of the PRSP activities remain to be implemented.
65.
Gains have been made in setting the basis for better civil service practices. The objective
to decompress the pay scale has been met; further decompression is not advisable given that
wages for entry level specialists would not be competitive. Transparency in the pay system has
been improved as bonuses and in-kind payments were integrated into the base pay, thus reducing
the remaining payments to less than 30 percent of total pay (compared to 75 percent in 2006). A
new Civil Service Law, approved in 2007, separates political and administrative functions and
makes merit recruitment through open competition compulsory for administrative positions.
Between 2006 and 2008, the number of posts advertised for competitive recruitment increased
from 640 to 1,707. Knowledge of the legal framework is adequate. Although merit based
selection is an increasing practice, merit based promotion is not well established as the “cadre
reserve approach” remains the norm. At present, the impact of these measures on actual
performance has not yet been evaluated as the conceptual framework for a performance appraisal
system is being put in place during 2009.
66.
Some progress has been made in public expenditure reform, but capacity remains a
major constraint. A 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment
provided benchmarks to track progress in public financial management (PFM) and identify
75

weaknesses. Tajikistan was at a relatively low stage in public expenditure reform (see CPIA
rating—2.6) and the Bank agenda on the ground is ambitious, including gradual introduction of a
MTEF and a move towards use of country systems. Partial results include the adoption of a new
Public Procurement Law (May 2006); an impact assessment will be available only with the next
PEFA. External control was reversed when the President restructured public agencies in late
2006. The restructuring limits the independence of the external audit body, the State Financial
Control Committee that was merged into the anti corruption agencies reporting to the President.
Subsequently, some progress has been made towards the establishment of an independent
external control. The Public Financial Management Modernization project, which was preceded
by the Public Sector Reform project, was recently approved by the Board in May 2009.
67.
Reforms of the structure of public administration have lagged expectations. Progress in
reforming public administration includes the reduction in the number of ministries and central
agencies and the introduction of the principle of separation of service delivery from policy
formulation. Progress in implementation has been slow as shown by various vertical reviews of
individual ministries. As a result, achievement of the proposed CPS result “clarification of
responsibilities between different layers of government at the central, regional and local level”
remains in mid-stream, with the remaining agenda to be addressed during the next CPS. It is
difficult to proceed in an environment where a dedicated institutional structure, one that is
expected to design, manage and monitor broad public administration reforms, is absent.
CPS contribution to improving governance
68.
Although the CPS emphasized governance and capacity building as cross-cutting themes,
this pillar included only work with the central government on civil service, financial
management and administration. Some progress has been made towards the ambitious agenda,
which was defined with the long-term in mind. Civil servant salaries are higher and new rules are
in place for hiring. A strategy for PFM has been adopted as has a new procurement law. On
administration, progress is less noticeable given a lack of appropriate counterpart for the
overhaul envisaged. With hindsight, and especially now given the on-going crisis, perhaps
greater attention should have been given to help the authorities address the multiple crises that
arise regularly.
69.
On the broader governance picture, the impact of the CPS program has been subdued and
not much progress has been made in improving sector governance, as had been expected. The
collapse of governance at the NBT caught all external observers by surprise. The IMF is now
leading the dialogue on getting NBT on track and taking the corrective measures that follow
from the recent audit. It remains to be seen what corrective actions the authorities will take
outside the NBT pursuant to the audit’s findings. Such measures will signal the willingness of
the authorities to move towards greater accountability. Governance improvements in energy
include the completion of the Barki-Tajik audit (although with a delay and a disclaimer due to
inadequate financial information on the company’s operations). The CPS kept the program out of
aluminum by design, but governance concerns remain with regard to the Tajik Aluminum Plant
(TADAZ) and with TALCO, a new company carved out to deal with international transactions.
Governance issues in cotton remain intractable.

76

IV.

BANK PERFORMANCE

70.
Delivery of operations set out in the FY06-09 CPS is on track but with a delay, as Table 1
shows. One operation was dropped (Poverty Alleviation III) and three operations are under
preparation (Regional Electricity, Health and Education SWAp). Several operations were added
to the indicative IDA program outlined in the CPS: (i) an Avian Flu Project in FY07; (ii) a
supplemental credit to the ongoing Dushanbe Water Supply Project; and (iii) a Youth
Development Grant funded by the Post-Conflict Trust Fund. Emergency projects including a
standalone Energy Emergency project, additional financing for Pamir Private Power, and Food
Security and Seeds imports were delivered in 2008. Tajikistan also benefited from the FTI in
2006 (IDA and other donors contributed US$18 million in grant terms over a two year period).
71.
A large number of small projects consume the supervision budget, reducing the resources
available for AAA. Today, 15 IDA operations are under implementation and the balance of
funds (approved and not yet disbursed) adds up to US$141.9 million. The distribution of
approved and undisbursed resources is aligned with the CPS. The portfolio also included 30
operations financed by trust funds (including IFC, WBI, Avian Flu, FTI, Food Price Crisis, GEF)
with total commitment of US$65 million (equivalent to the remainder of IDA15 allocation), of
which US$30 million are undisbursed. Jumbo Trust Funds represent the bulk of the portfolio,
and the education sector accounted for about 30 percent of all trust funds. There are also smaller
sized Trust Funds, such as 3 Institutional Development Funds (IDFs) (characterized by slow
implementation), a First Initiative grant, and PHRD grants for project development.
72.
The CPS delivered financial resources to the budget in line with the initial estimates.
During the CPS period, IDA disbursed U$410 million, which was slightly less than the
US$433.5 million in the original disbursement estimates. Most of the projects disbursed much
quicker than originally expected. However, the Ferghana Valley, Land Registration and Cotton
Sector Recovery projects brought the performance down.
73.
The mix of investment and development policy lending has been in line with the CPS
outline. As planned, a PDPG series is providing a platform for policy dialogue with government
on a broad range of themes (mostly capacity and competitiveness) and supporting the
implementation of the investment projects. The full PDPG series (3 operations) have been
delivered, with a delay in the delivery of PDPG III due to the need for the government to
complete the IMF SMP. An ICR for the PDPG series is pending.
74.
The three PDPG operations drove the policy dialogue with the authorities and helped
coordinate implementation of the CPS program, contributing to the achievement of a significant
share of CPS results. Its agenda was broad, touching on all of the core areas of the CPS. It has
helped to promote private sector development by supporting liberalization of the aviation sector,
encouraging transparency in the privatization of SOEs, and supporting adoption of laws to
prevent monopolistic practices. With IFC, it has moved along the agenda on reducing the
regulatory burden of inspections and licenses. In agriculture, it has targeted measures to give
farmers a better deal, with positive results towards the end of the period. It has supported the
dialogue on financing of education and health services and helped to ensure that budget
allocations for the services were protected during the recent global economic crisis. It has
promoted greater efficiency and financial viability of the energy sector through support for better
77

corporate and financial management. On public sector management, the PDPG has supported
significant public financial management reforms, including adoption of a new procurement law,
establishment of an external audit function, strengthening of internal audit, and civil service pay
reform. To achieve these results, PDPG worked with sectors and IFC where investment
operations are ongoing, and mobilized additional resources from other donors to advance the
agenda. However the degree of coordination with sector teams varied considerably from one
sector to another and this is an area for further improvement.
75.
Despite its successes, the difficult environment has affected PDPG implementation,
particularly the crisis at NBT, which led to delays in preparing PDPG 3. The PDPG operation
has been most successful in areas for which government ownership has been strong, technical
assistance has been available (from the Bank or other donors), consensus among other
development partners on the way forward has been forged, and engagement on the issues has
been long term. A thorough assessment of its contribution to the country's reform agenda, in this
difficult environment, will have to wait for the ICR. Continuing with the PDPG operation will
help to deepen the reform agenda that is underway and to support reforms in emerging areas.
76.
AAA has contributed to advancing the program in various ways, but some have come
with a delay. AAA work contributed to the preparation of the 2006-2009 PRSP, the PDPG
dialogue and project design. The PPER process supported Tajikistan’s first PEFA selfassessment, in partnership with the Swiss Economic Cooperation (SECO), in January 2007. In
addition, the PPER has taken stock of health and education issues and debt sustainability. The
TLSS completed and under processing, covers health, education, labor market participation, food
security, and access to financial services, children immunization, and other themes. Its results
will allow the government and the development partners to take stock of progress towards PRSP
outcomes. Policy notes include a poverty profile at the national and regional levels; migration
and labor markets; food security; gender aspects of access to land and financial assets; access to
and quality of public health and education services; and social safety nets. UNICEF, DFID, and
the government are the main contributors. Other AAA includes a Fiduciary Assessment of the
Education and Health Sectors, Fiduciary Assessment of Tajikistan’s Portfolio, sector strategies for
agriculture and private sector development, and three policy notes on Enhancing Development
Impact of Remittances, Civil Service Wages, and Aviation. AAA work has been of good quality,
informative, and, for the most part, timely (with an exception of the CEM that is expected to be
completed in FY10).
77.
Portfolio quality has deteriorated slightly during the implementation of the CPS. At the
beginning of the CPS, the portfolio did not have problem projects (although 3 projects were rated
not likely to meet their Development Objectives). Today, 5 projects are at risk, of which one has
a moderately unsatisfactory development objective that represents a significant deterioration in
portfolio performance since the start of the CPS. The disbursement rate is at 38.1 percent in
FY09, compared to an ECA average of 17.1 percent.
78.
IDA has emphasized training for policy makers, including several high-level leadership
seminars. IDA, in collaboration with WBI, organized a high-level workshop in February 2006
for the economic and social team of the government, which was very well received. A
subsequent leadership seminar for the new Cabinet of Ministers was held in April 2007 and
focused on the strategic reform priorities for Tajikistan and showcased the experiences of a
78

number of more advanced countries. Most recently, a high level seminar for crisis management
brought to Tajikistan several high level international practitioners to share their experiences with the
authorities.
79.
Periodic CPPRs have tracked gradual progress in addressing key implementation
concerns. The action plan agreed to at the third government-IDA-ADB CPPR, held in October
2006, focused on resolving four systemic issues: mainstreaming Project Implementation Units
(PIUs); orienting project implementation towards outcomes; resolving taxation issues; and
expediting government procedures on project selection, approval and implementation. The fourth
government-IDA-ADB CPPR (2008) took stock of progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2006 CPPR and reports:
x

Development partners’ efforts to reduce the costs of project implementation through
more integrated mechanisms and the use of country institutions have brought several
projects under the same implementation unit, such as in the energy sector the Center for
Management of Projects that implements eight energy infrastructure projects. However,
differences in fiduciary, reporting and accountability systems of the government and
development partners are retarding implementation of more integrated agendas. To
address this concern, ADB and the WB have streamlined and harmonized their
operational procedures. In addition, the WB has been moving away from self-standing
PIUs for project implementation. , Of 18 projects, 10 are implemented by stand-alone
PIUs, six are implemented by their respective ministries or agencies, two by a stateowned enterprise (Barki-Tajik), and another by a private company (Pamir Energy). The
gradual approach to phasing out PIUs has been necessary to avoid potentially sharp drops
in performance.

x

A recent fiduciary review of Bank operations in Tajikistan did not find any evidence of
fraud, but did find ample room for improvement. Physical inspection of the works
undertaken showed that 67 percent had deficiencies due to poor quality of materials and
workmanship, use of second hand materials in construction, and lack of proper
maintenance. Only 37 percent of procurement was rated fully satisfactory, while only 16
percent was unsatisfactory. The review identified the following: (a) the need for tighter
adherence to agreed procurement procedures, (b) inadequate competition from inside and
outside Tajikistan, and (c) weak Borrower’s contract administration procedures. As to
financial management, the review rated 39 percent as fully satisfactory with 17 percent
either fully or highly unsatisfactory. The review found that competitive and adequate
salaries strengthen implementation by attracting better qualified and experienced
financial management and disbursement staff.

x

Since the 2006 CPPR, efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation of projects has
produced gains but monitoring & evaluation (M&E) remains weak with several projects
still lacking them on account of limited in-country capacity and training opportunities.
The consequence is that the government and development partners lack information for a
timely assessment of performance and the needed corrections to avoid delays and deliver
on results.

79

80.
Coordination among development partners is improving. At the beginning of the CPS,
partners faced a large number of fragmented operations that increased the cost of delivering
assistance and, at times, provided contradictory advice. Partners are now working on developing
joint project implementation units and co-financing interventions around common agendas.
Examples include an FTI grant; co-financing for the Basic Community Health Project from the
Swedish Agency for Development Cooperation (SIDA) and the Swiss Development Corporation
(SDC); co-financing of the National Statistical Capacity Building Project by SIDA and DFID;
work on public expenditure management with DFID, Swiss SECO; and cooperation with
UNICEF. IDA has led the way for the establishment of the Donor Coordination Council in
Dushanbe.
81.
The CPS identified the risks well, but the country and partners could have done a better
job of developing and implementing remedies. While the CPS foresaw the risk to the country
associated with a global slowdown, the authorities did not take advantage of the four good years
for building up reserves. Nor did the country take advantage of the favorable climate to
implement reform to improve supply conditions and generate income opportunities; instead, it
relied on exporting labor to release the political and economic pressures emanating from a
growing population. The energy crisis, not foreseen in the CPS, evidenced the vulnerability of
the economy to external shocks. Despite all of this, the country has maintained political stability.
V.

LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

82.
The implementation of the CPS teaches that ambitious reform agendas in weak
institutional environments can easily overburden the authorities. Acknowledging the lack of
capacity is not enough; the program should also embed this awareness in a credible way. In this
CPS, the strategy of building the capacity of the central government represented a long-term
approach, which was not fully relevant to the challenges that the authorities faced. As a result,
despite high growth and improvement in social indicators, governance failures became even
more evident. Today, the country faces several crises: a drop in remittances, low world prices for
cotton and aluminum, a drop in public revenues, a frail financial system, returning migrants,
weak capacity, and tarnished credibility.
83.
CPS implementation teaches that progress comes when programs target well-defined
outcomes and factor in capacity constraints through intensive AAA, and allow adequate time and
dedication for policy dialogue and technical assistance, all characteristics of the PDPG operation.
Therefore, this review calls for realism in program design and adherence to strict prioritization.
Such an approach will assure prompt delivery of results that generate a virtuous cycle, rather
than disperse and lead to incomplete efforts that harm the credibility of the initiatives. A more
realistic approach requires scaling-down overambitious goals, identifying risk sources, and
providing capacity-building support according to needs. The next strategy may focus on
implementing the laws and strategies currently in place; and when trying to arrive at “new
institutional frameworks,” it should consider using experimentation and dialogue rather than
imposing the design on the client and thereby risking limited understanding and buy-in.

80

A. Strategic Recommendations: Sharpening the Results Agenda
84.
The CPS agenda remains valid as does the 2007 PRSP, but the crisis adds new urgencies
that must be addressed within a vision that acknowledges that the favorable events of the last
four years are not likely to recur over the medium to long-term. In facing this new reality, the
team must review the relevance and adequacy of the operations in place and then focus the next
strategy on realistic results concomitant with the capacity of the country and the emergency of
the situation.
85.
Building credibility and addressing the current emergencies. The loss of credibility from
the various governance failures handicaps the ability of the country to deal with the current
crisis. Reportedly, under IMF guidance, the authorities will be taking corrective measures at the
NBT, but the authorities have yet to address issues of accountability. The extent and enthusiasm
of development partners’ support will depend on assurances of a proper use of resources that
help the poor and preserve the gains made thus far. The credibility of the government will hinge
on decisions made about the allocation of resources, their use in the budget, and impact on the
ground. Over the longer haul, credibility based on better governance will help bring in the
international partners that Tajikistan needs to carry out its vision of development, especially in
the energy sector.
86.
Generating an elastic domestic supply of goods and services is critical to handling the
short, medium and long-term challenges. Constraints to domestic supply remain high. The
analytical work either completed or nearing completion (2008 BEEPS, CEM, LSS, etc.) can
inform partners on the immediate priorities to generate a healthy supply response. Attention will
have to be paid to energy availability, which ranks as one of the highest constraints, and access
to finance. The Bank needs to think of alternative forms of engagement in agriculture, such as
reallocating efforts away from cotton to agricultural diversification, rural finance and
institutional building. Expansion of the non-cotton economy offers considerable opportunities.
Developing regional energy markets remains relevant, but the partners must face the hurdles in
place systematically and promptly. These include improving drastically the governance in BarkiTajik, addressing the concerns of the neighboring countries on the impact on water supply
downstream, and developing solid contractual schemes for energy export.
87.
A priority in health and education should be consolidating the gains by further
strengthening the ministries, scaling up the pilot experiences, and addressing skill shortages. A
short-term priority should be maintaining the gains by protecting expenditure, including salaries
of teachers and health workers. The forward agenda could consider strengthening the social
assistance system to help the needy through the crisis. Over the longer-term, the scaling-up of
pilot experiences will require resources and selecting adequate technologies—not necessarily
those used at the pilot scale–that give maximum impact. Improving the quality of water will need
massive resources, which requires the engagement of the broader donor community and
improvements in sector governance. The crisis should not hinder continuation of key initiatives,
such as per-capita allocation of budget resources in education and primary health care and the
basic package of health services.

81

B. Operational Recommendations
88.
Embrace a selectivity policy. The previous strategy announced a policy of selectivity but
did not deliver on it. The new strategy has to. Managing a large number of small operations
consumes valuable budget resources that could be used for strengthening supervision, AAA and
policy dialogue. Besides reducing the number of operations, a policy of selectivity must also be
applied at the sector level as part of a strategy to avoid an overambitious agenda. For instance, it
is not only about remaining engaged in agriculture but about whether to engage a broad agenda
or rather a few, select, and targeted interventions at a lower scale.
89.
Continue a mix of DPO and investment. As noted, the DPO was affected by an
overambitious CPS design in a difficult environment. The DPO did not achieve much, but the
few results of the CPS (except for health and education) were achieved with the DPO. The
success of DPO in aviation was due to its focus and a lot of effort. To make the DPO more
effective, its design should be more focused, and the crisis provides that opportunity. Continued
DPO will help the government finance the fiscal gap that has emerged with the crisis (even after
government’s corrective actions to rationalize expenditure). It has proven to be an effective
instrument for policy dialogue with the government. The theme and prior actions to be included
in the DPO must benefit from the lessons learned of past experience, new analytical works, and
emerging realities. The past teaches that DPO works best when it is well focused on concrete
outcomes and is complemented by intensive technical assistance, given the limited capacity of
government. It is important that the DPO agenda align with the CPS and be based on analytical
work, especially the forthcoming CEM. This will help sharpen insights on constraints to growth,
especially in agriculture. The emerging circumstances call for a focus on the crisis by
maintaining or protecting the mid-term agenda. The DPO can help organize the Bank support as
well as cooperation with other development partners. As to investment, priority should be placed
on completing the ongoing agenda through additional financing.
90.
Utilize AAA to open new vistas where the issues are unclear or a common view has not
yet emerged. AAA needs to be used more aggressively as an advocacy instrument in areas where
there is limited buy-in from the authorities and to raise the relevant issues nationally. Hence,
greater attention should be placed on dissemination.
91.
Continue efforts to harmonize development partners’ support. Harmonization of
development partners’ activities can help improve implementation performance, but care should
be taken that the costs of harmonization and coordination do not outweigh its gains. The partners
can heed the lessons from the 2008 ADB and WB PCPR that advises working under well
developed sector agendas that include: (a) fully cost activities, strengthening of capacity
(planning, budget execution, procurement, tracking and reporting, etc.) at the level of the
ministries and other executing bodies, (b) the gradual absorption of PIU’s into the administrative
structures, (c) realistic result frameworks, and (d) agenda or time table to move towards the use
of country systems. Because it takes time to field such an agenda, the partners may want to
proceed gradually with a focus first on operational aspects.

In addition, it is advisable to
truly mainstream capacity
building and governance
concerns in various
components of the program.

Annex 3: CPS Stakeholder Consultations
1.
Process. CPS consultations were held in four cities in Tajikistan (Dushanbe, KurganTube, Khojand, and Khorog) during September 8-17, 2009 with representatives of various
stakeholders including central and local regional governments, non-governmental organizations
and private sector representatives, the Parliament and donor organizations. The CPS outreach
was broad especially in the regions and discussions with stakeholders were highly participatory
and interactive. The consultations sought to validate the analytical underpinning of the CPS,
share the lessons learned from implementation of the previous CPS, and seek their inputs on the
CPS strategic objectives, the proposed program and priorities. The challenges and opportunities
for CPS implementation were discussed with various stakeholders. This included fiduciary,
institutional, environmental and the external risks. These inputs will enable the WBG to respond
to new demands and to adjust its program appropriately during the implementation period.
2.
As the CPS Board discussion was postponed from November 2009 to May 25, 2010,
the WBG held the second round of CPS consultation both with senior government officials
and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). Consultation with senior government officials held at
various times during December 2009-February 2010. Consultation with CSOs was held on
March 31, 2010 because the CSOs requested to broaden and deepen consultation of the CPS.
CSOs expressed their high appreciation to the Bank in organizing the second consultation and
they actively participated in the CPS discussions and provided their comments and inputs to the
Bank team. In total representatives of 42 CSOs participated during the second consultation
including international organizations and academic institutions.
3.
Topics for discussion. The consultations served as a platform for informative exchange
with the central and regional governments, civil society organizations, and development partners
on the key development challenges affecting Tajikistan. They also sought inputs from the
stakeholders on the proposed CPS program that address these challenges. The main topics
discussed included (a) economic and governance context; (b) lessons learned from past World
Bank Group engagement; (c) CPS Strategic Objectives; and (d) the proposed program and
priorities. During the last round, the consultation with the government focused mostly on specific
issues including the Bank’s support in conducting assessments for the construction of the
Roghun hydropower plant in the CPS context and the use of IDA Crisis Window. The
consultation also focused on recent changes introduced to the CPS including the WBG
commitment in conducting techno-economical, environmental and social assessments, PRSP III,
and the use of IDA Crisis Window. During the discussion, the participants raised issues of
CSOs’ participation in the CPS program, construction of Rogun hydropower station in
Tajikistan, and transparency of WB activities in Tajikistan.
4.
Results. The consultations provided excellent opportunity for the WBG to learn the
views of various stakeholders both government and non-governmental partners about the
relevance of the proposed CPS in Tajikistan. The issues of governance at national and local
levels and weak fiduciary control were major concerns raised by participants. They were in
agreement with the CPS objectives and the proposed program that focuses on community
agriculture and rural development, climate changes, energy and water infrastructure
rehabilitation, education, and health. There was a diversity of views on sectoral coordination and
89

capacity related issues. Stakeholders welcomed closer collaboration and dialogue in the course of
CPS implementation, its monitoring and evaluation.
5.
Feedback inputs from consultations include general issues related to the CPS.
Participants raised concerns about (a) the commitment and capacity of the government to design
and implement needed reforms and weak implementation capacities at both central and local
administrations; (b) limited transparency and accountability of governmental structures utilizing
donor’s aid; (c) prioritization among economic, infrastructure and social priority in view of
limited available resources; (d) transparency of WB activities through timely dissemination of
information about the WB activities using the web and TV and to conduct a joint consultation
meeting with the other stakeholders, such as ministries and other government actors. They
supported the Bank’s role in (a) protecting social sector expenditure to meet its social obligations
through budgetary support; (b) easing the complexity and implementation of the regional water
and energy projects, involving neighboring countries, (c) improving donor’s coordination; and
(d) greater involving non-governmental organizations in the monitoring and evaluation,
especially in some projects such as migration, Emergency Food Crisis and Seed Imports, gender
issue, health and education, and anti-corruption. CSOs noted that the Civil Society Small Grant
program is too small given the many important issues that need to be addressed in Tajikistan.
6.
Participants in the CPS consultations also provided feedback specifically related to
sector issues. In the energy sector, participants suggested the WBG to identify a key energy
sub-sector that could be developed in a sustainable manner. They recognized the need to explore
hydro power generation opportunities and identify the environmental risks for downstream
countries. They suggested that Tajikistan make use of the Clean Energy Development
Mechanism and wanted to know the role of CSOs in the technical, economical and social impact
studies of the Rogun. CSOs raised concerns about the government’s sales of the Rogun shares to
the public and businesses and the transparency in the use of the Rogun’s funds. In the
agricultural and rural development sector, participants recognized the need to rehabilitate
agriculture and irrigation infrastructure and to provide high-quality seeds that critical for farmer
survival. They supported private farming and agribusiness through value chain management,
equitable land reform and transparent process of cotton debt resolution, improved access to the
rural finance, and mountainous regions economic development and tourism. In the education
sector, they encouraged the Bank to support school rehabilitations in remote regions, expand FTI
to train more teachers, and continue education financing reform. In the health sector, participants
suggested the Bank to revisit family medicine, rehabilitate rural health facilities, and pay more
attention to HIV/AIDS, especially among returning migrants. In migration, participants
suggested the Bank to expand vocational skills development programs, and use returning
migrants for private sector development and new businesses. In the finance and banking sector,
they suggested that the Bank improve access to long-term credit, expand microfinance scheme,
increase trade financing and support leasing financing. To address cross cutting issues,
participants indicated the need to update gender analysis, girl’s education to receive more
priority and address climate change issues such as analysis of glaciers melting and land
degradation. On Gender, the CSOs suggested that international organizations coordinate their
effort in addressing gender issues; On Youth, participants suggested that the WB develop a
poverty strategy document for the young people.

7.

Overall Conclusions.
a. The Bank has been a respected partner for Tajikistan and still has a role to play due to
its expertise and its analytical works.
b. Main priorities for further Bank work in Tajikistan should address the need to meet
long-term challenges in sustainable economic and social development, improved
capacities and governance reforms.
c. Key areas for development in partnership with the Bank include water and energy,
agriculture and rural development, health, education.
d. The Bank will encourage the government to increase CSOs involvement in the Bankfinanced projects through intensification of communication to CSOs about the WB
activities, and about potential areas of involvement.

Annex 4: Country Governance and Anti Corruption Strategy
I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Tajikistan as a CGAC Country. Tajikistan was selected by regional management as
one of four countries in the ECA region to pilot the CGAC process. This approach involves
increased attention to governance in both strategic and operational aspects of World Bank
assistance to client countries. Based on lessons learned during implementation of the previous
CPS, the World Bank’s engagement on governance in Tajikistan will move toward
mainstreaming governance at the national, sector, and project levels. “Mainstreaming” is the
approach to governance reform in Tajikistan that has been developed in response to lessons
learned under the previous CPS, where efforts to address governance were restricted to the
central government level and not well integrated into sector approaches or individual program
design. Mainstreaming does not mean abandoning central government governance reforms, but
complementing them with emphasizing sector and project level interventions.33
2.
Basic Framework for the Tajikistan CGAC Strategy. Within the CGAC framework,
the World Bank will assist the Government of Tajikistan in tackling three principal governance
challenges: (a) strengthening transparency and accountability; (b) developing capacity; and (c)
fostering demand for good governance. Governance interventions will be mainstreamed
throughout the portfolio, with an emphasis on consolidating and/or scaling up existing
instruments of engagement to achieve strategic goals. A major innovation of this strategy is the
development and adoption of a Governance Checklist for Tajikistan, a new project-level tool to
ensure proper attention to three governance challenges at all stages of the project cycle in all new
and reviewed operations.
3.

Tackling the Three Governance Challenges.
x

Strengthening Transparency and Accountability is a wide-ranging challenge in
Tajikistan, which requires diverse interventions in the Bank Group’s portfolio. These
include, but are not limited to: supporting audits of SOEs; developing a transparent
civil service classification and pay grading system; improving transparency of budget
preparation and execution through effective business processes; installing digital
electricity meters to ensure transparency of usage, charges, and payments; and
introducing per-capita financing in schools and primary health care facilities.

x

Capacity Development refers not only to individual skill-building initiatives, such as
training, but also to institutional and organizational development, and strengthening

33

Governance challenges and risks at the country and sector levels relate to legislative and regulatory frameworks
for ensuring transparency, accountability and appropriate incentives for government and economic agents.
Governance issues at the project level are much more specifically targeted in terms of (sub-) sectoral details,
locations, agents, etc. Yet these various levels are inextricably linked: governance challenges at country and sector
level (e.g., unsatisfactory sector policy framework, lack of policy coordination, lack of reform ownership, fiduciary
risks) translate into risks to successful project implementation and achievement of project’s development objectives.
Addressing governance challenges at the country and sector level must therefore go hand in hand with efforts to
address operational governance challenges and risks.

92

the government’s capacity for policy development and management. Specific
interventions in this area include: supporting the PFM Council to manage various
aspects of PFM agenda; providing technical assistance (TA) to the health sector on
budget management; providing TA to strengthen management of infrastructure and
energy utility service operations; and building capacity in the Ministry of Education
to engage in data-driven policy making and results monitoring.
x

Fostering Demand for Good Governance focuses on partnering with entities other
than the executive branch of government to promote accountability in the executive
and societal ownership of reforms. Interventions include: strengthening parliamentary
oversight of the budget process; creating and working with Parent-Teacher
Associations (PTAs) in pilot schools; creating and empowering community-based
organizations to manage communal water distribution systems; training and providing
information to rural cotton producers; and involving Water User Associations in
issuing land certificates in pilot areas. Table 1 provides an overview of existing
instruments in the Bank portfolio that will carry out and/or scale up these
interventions.

Tajikistan Portfolio Governance Checklist. One of the main innovations of the
Tajikistan CGAC is to mainstream efforts to tackle the three governance challenges through the
application of a Governance Checklist in all sectors for every new operation, additional
financing, or midterm review. The checklist contains a series of questions to be asked by the
country management unit (CMU) to ensure that governance implications are considered in the
design and implementation of programs, that governance interventions are channeled through
operations, and that each operation in the portfolio contributes to improving the governance
environment in Tajikistan. This tool is also designed to identify sectors and projects where
additional fiduciary or non-fiduciary safeguards, such as political economy analysis or
stakeholder analysis, are necessary. The checklist is discussed in Section V and attached in Table
1.
94

5.
The CGAC Process in Tajikistan. The formulation of Tajikistan’s CGAC strategy has
relied on an inclusive and participatory process, building a strong ownership within the Bank’s
country team. The process began with a brainstorming session among country office staff in
Dushanbe in December 2008, during which a CGAC Matrix was developed. The matrix
presented a list of governance challenges, as well as entry points and instruments for tackling
them at the country, sector, and project levels. The main lesson from this brainstorming session
was that the Bank’s portfolio already contained many governance interventions, but these
interventions often went undocumented and did not follow an explicitly defined, coherent
strategy. Consequently, the Tajikistan portfolio underwent a mini-governance review in MarchApril 2009. Most governance interventions being undertaken within ongoing lending operations
were recorded and categorized, and the basic storyline for approaching governance in the
Tajikistan CPS for FY10-12 was developed. The process culminated with a Country Team
CGAC Workshop in Dushanbe in May 2009, during which the country team provided valuable
inputs to the CPS approach to governance and participated in structured brainstorming to
develop the Governance Checklist.
6.
Roadmap for This Document. Section II of this CGAC strategy document provides
some background on the governance approach undertaken in the previous CPS and reviews the
most recent governance developments in Tajikistan. Section III discusses governance at the
country Level, including an analysis of cross-country governance indicators and their
implications for the three governance challenges. Section IV reviews strategies for tackling
governance at the sector level, particularly in sustainable development, human development, and
private and financial sector development. Section V proposes a governance strategy at the project
level, including adoption of the Governance Checklist and strengthening of fiduciary safeguards.
Section VI describes how these interventions will be scaled up at all levels, given that the
Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 funds have become available. Finally, Section VII
outlines a process for M&E of CGAC results in the context of the CPS.
II.

BACKGROUND

7.
Governance in the Previous CPS. The CPS (FY06-FY09) considered governance a
significant challenge to development in Tajikistan, drawing on the premise that the main
governance weaknesses stemmed from the legacy of the civil war, necessitating a move from
security consolidation to construction of a modern state, and resulting in a complex political
economy. The aluminum and cotton sectors were considered to be particularly plagued by
interference of political power and vested interests. Low salaries in the public service led to low
accountability. Under the last CPS, the Bank focused the bulk of its support on building capacity
within the central government as the backbone of a long-term strategy to address governance
constraints. The main components of this governance strategy were public expenditure reform,
fiduciary reform, and public administration and civil service reforms. Bank support took the
form of policy dialogue under the PDPG, Public Administration Reform Project, Statistical
Support Project, and analytical work such as functional reviews and a Public Sector Pay Policy
Note. Progress has been slow, however, and achievement of the CPS results has been less than
expected due to insufficient political will, weak commitment, and lack of capacity.
95

8.
Current Governance Situation: Rebuilding Credibility at the National and Sector
Levels. During the previous CPS period, dysfunctional governance arrangements in Tajikistan
were revealed in a series of critical domestic policy slippages. In 2007, it was discovered that the
NBT provided a series of guarantees and pledges to private companies in the cotton sector
without reporting them to the IMF. This misreporting constituted a misstep in monetary policy
and contributed to undermining macroeconomic performance. In addition, the government’s
credibility in the eyes of its own people was eroded by critical energy shortages during the severe
winter of 2008, poor performance of SOEs in the energy sector (especially Barki-Tajik and Tajik
Gas), and low capacity to manage global food and fuel crises that erupted in 2008. However,
some long-standing institutional reforms being undertaken in the executive branch have begun to
show results recently. Rule-based management is taking root in the civil service. The MoF is
introducing a new administrative budget classification to better track public expenditure. The
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection is improving its systems through more efficient
functional assignments and efforts to enhance accountability. The Ministry of Justice is
improving access to justice through the Adliya database of legislative information and the
monthly Official Bulletin of Legal Acts.
9.
Current Governance Situation: Fiduciary Risks at the Project Level. In addition to
creating challenges for overall national development, Tajikistan’s governance environment also
poses risks to Bank operations. Though ongoing efforts to strengthen country systems are
expected to help lower these risks over the medium-term, the Bank needs to safeguard against
them in the short term. The weak fiduciary environment results from low government capacity
combined with limited transparency in public financial management. A CPFR conducted in 2008
found that, in virtually every project, procurement did not adhere to agreed-upon procedures. In
some cases, procurement proceeded despite inadequate competition for goods, works, and
services among vendors within and outside Tajikistan. Weak contract administration was
identified as a problem, as physical inspections of civil works in nine projects revealed
deficiencies in quality of materials, workmanship, and maintenance of equipment, as well as
instances of procured goods not being used for their intended purpose. Though most projects
earned marginally satisfactory or better ratings on financial management and disbursement, with
no evidence of fraud or ineligible expenditures, the review concluded that staff in PIUs had a
poor understanding of the Bank’s requirements in these areas. These weaknesses represent
fiduciary risks that must be ring-fenced in project design and implementation.
10.
Government’s Efforts to Improve the Governance Environment. The government
appreciates that the gravity of the situation in Tajikistan is such that general statements about
improving governance will not suffice; instead, there is a need for clear and significant steps to
demonstrate the government’s commitment to increasing transparency and accountability in the
country. The government has begun taking such steps, including: (1) completing a special audit
of the NBT and other parties involved in the misreporting of financial information in the cotton
sector, with support from Ernst & Young; (2) revising the NBT and commercial banking laws to
improve transparency and eliminate conflicts of interest; (3) contracting an internationally
reputable auditing firm to conduct financial audits of TALCO and the state electricity company
(Barki Tajik) in 2007; (4) establishing a supervision unit within MoF to regularly monitor the
financial operations of the ten largest SOEs; (5) establishing a reporting regime for contingent
96

liabilities, covering SOEs, public institutions and the NBT; (6) abolishing cotton export licensing
by the NBT; and (7) agreeing to pursue resolution of the cotton debt resolution in a systematic
manner, by adopting a Presidential Decree (May 2009), Government Resolution (June 2009),
and Action Plan agreed to with donors. The latter is expected to become the platform for
development and implementation of agrarian reforms to ensure freedom to farm, accelerate land
titling and improve farmers’ access to finance and collateral practices. All of the above steps
notwithstanding, this process is at an early stage, and implementation is complicated by low
management capacity, an unfavorable external environment, multiple economic and financial
crises, limited resources and support, and the potential threat that popular discontent could lead
to civil unrest if expectations are not carefully managed.
11.
Proposed Governance Approach for the Current CPS. In the complex governance
environment described above, the Bank must find a meaningful way to engage on governance
reform in Tajikistan while setting realistic goals and expectations for what can be accomplished
over the CPS period. In the long run, development effectiveness can be achieved only if
governance systems are strengthened; the long-term goal of the Bank’s governance engagement
is therefore to build a transparent and efficient governance system that will make the government
accountable to its citizens for delivering public goods and services. In the short term, the Bank
aims to assist the Government of Tajikistan in regaining its credibility among citizens and the
international community and to engage with a wide range of non-state actors to hold the
government to account. The Bank will attempt to tackle three principal governance challenges—
strengthening transparency and accountability, developing capacity, and fostering demand for
good governance—while ring-fencing against risks posed by the complex governance
environment.
III.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL

Diagnostics: Governance Indicators.
12.
Tajikistan in Cross-Country Comparisons.34 Country-level data suggest that Tajikistan
fares worse, on average, than regional and income group comparators in addressing the three
governance challenges addressed in this strategy. Table 2 shows how Tajikistan compares with
the regional and low-income country averages on governance outcomes (economic growth,
control of corruption, quality of economic and social policies); governance institutions (quality
of public administration, rule of law, executive constraints); private sector governance (ease of
business start-up, management time spent dealing with regulations); and other dimensions of
governance (public financial management, judicial system, gender empowerment).

34

Many cross-country governance indicators are available to assess a country’s performance on various dimensions
of governance as compared to regional and income-group peers. Some of these indicators are “broad,” using
statistical models to aggregate several pieces of underlying data and provide a general picture of a broad governance
dimension, such as Voice and Accountability or Rule of Law. Other indicators are “actionable,” measuring a narrow
governance issue, such as the number of days it takes to register property, or the extent to which the availability of
budget funds is predictable. The WB supports the development of both types of indicators, including the Worldwide
Governance Indicators (WGI), BEEPS, DB, PEFA, CPIA), and others. Many other governance indicators are
available from development partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions, including
Polity IV, Freedom House Nations in Transit, Reporters without Borders Freedom of Press Index, and others.

97

x

Strengthening Transparency and Accountability: The most widely discussed
governance outcome related to transparency and accountability is Control of
Corruption. WGI 2007 ranks Tajikistan in the 20th percentile (20.3) in the world on
Control of Corruption, lower than ECA (36.9) and LIC (22.9) averages. As a
testament to Tajikistan’s non-transparent and burdensome business regulations, DB
(2009) ranks Tajikistan 168th among 181 countries with respect to the ease of starting
a business, worse than both the ECA (77) and LIC (119) averages.

x

Capacity Development: Tajikistan’s CPIA score for Quality of Public Administration
was 2.5 out of 6.0 in 2008, as compared to the ECA and LIC averages of 3.3 and 2.9,
respectively, implying that Tajikistan lags in institutional and human capacity in
public administration. The same index ranks the Quality of Economic Policies at 3.6,
as compared to ECA (4.1) and LIC (3.4) averages. At 3.0, Tajikistan’s Efficiency of
Revenue Mobilization also lags behind ECA (3.8) and LIC (3.2) averages.

x

Fostering Demand For Good Governance: According to Polity IV 2006, Executive
Constraints in Tajikistan are scored at 3.0, which is below both ECA (5.30) and LIC
(3.9) averages and suggests that civil society and non-executive branches of
government need further strengthening in order to ensure accountable and efficient
executive power. Similarly, WGI ranks Tajikistan in the 10th percentile in the world
(10.6) on Voice and Accountability, significantly below ECA (40.5) and LIC (27.5)
averages.

13.
Country-Level Strategy. The data presented above suggest that country-level
governance challenges in Tajikistan are much more profound than in other countries in the
region or low-income group. Particular caution must therefore be applied in creating realistic
expectations as to what can be achieved during this CPS period. The most prudent approach is to
build on existing initiatives and expect incremental gains.
a. Strengthening Transparency and Accountability at the country level will involve
the following initiatives:
i.

Policy dialogue on wage reform, PFM reform, external audit, privatization, and
audit of energy SOEs; civil service reform; public sector restructuring
(Instrument: PDPG series)

ii.

Enhancing transparency and accountability of regulatory management; improving
access to justice for government and businesses through the Adliya legal
database; developing a transparent civil service classification and pay grading
system (Instrument: Public Sector Reform Project)

iii.

Improving transparency of the budget preparation and execution process;
strengthening internal controls; installing a Financial Management Information
System (FMIS); supporting an improved budget classification and chart of
accounts to enhance transparent reporting on budget execution (Instrument:
Public Financial Management Modernization Project)

98

b. Capacity Development at the country level will include the following activities:
i.

Developing sound procurement practices in the Public Procurement Agency
(Instrument: PDPG)

ii.

Facilitating international training for high-level civil servants; developing the
training capacity of the Institute for Higher Qualification of Civil Servants;
strengthening the role of the Executive Office of the President in policy
coordination; providing budget management TA to improve job classifications
and wage grid in the health sector (Instrument: Public Sector Reform Project)

iii.

Analyzing capacity gaps in PFM and developing a functioning training
infrastructure for PFM; supporting the PFM Council in integrating and managing
different aspects of the PFM agenda (Instrument: Public Financial Management
Modernization Project)

c. Fostering Demand for Good Governance at the country level focuses on enhancing
parliamentary supervision of the budgetary process (Instrument: Public Finance
Voice and Accountability Trust Fund). The objectives of this new DFID-supported,
Bank-executed initiative are three-fold: (1) enhancing parliamentary oversight of
budget preparation and execution; (2) strengthening communication and media
coverage of budget issues, both in terms of quantity and quality; and (3) increasing
citizens’ participation in the budget process at the local government level.
14.
Analytical and Advisory Activities. An Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) will
be undertaken during the CPS period to assess how fiscal decentralization institutions function,
both de jure and de facto. Particular attention will be paid to how the existing institutional setup
contributes to the transparency of fiscal processes, as well as how the accountability of the local
and central officials is influenced by the institutional structure. This study will provide further
understanding of institutional incentives and constraints and shed light on more efficient ways to
tackle governance challenges in this environment.
15.
Mitigating Governance Risks at the Country Level: The Virtual Poverty Fund.
Given that a development policy operation is in place in Tajikistan, questions on the proper use
of budget support resources naturally arise in the context of the country’s complex governance
environment. In order to ring-fence the budget support funds provided under the auspices of the
PDPG, and thus respond to oversight requirements, a VPF has been created to track crisis-related
spending of budget support funds. The VPF will tag specific budget expenditures using existing
budget classifications, link specific resources to ensure budget allocation for these expenditures,
and thereby monitor the performance of donors’ budget support in supporting pro-poor activities
(such as improved service delivery to the poor and other priorities set out in the government’s
Poverty Reduction Strategy), responding to the crisis, and supporting the foundations of a
medium-term development agenda. The VPF will likely include the following core expenditures:
(a) untied transfers from the central government to supplement local revenues in poorer local
governments, (b) subsidies to poorer households for electricity consumption, and (c) adult
training centers for returning migrants. To monitor the use of funds, the VPF will report on all
protected expenditures at the central and local levels on a quarterly and annual basis.
99

IV.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE SECTOR LEVEL

16.
Tackling Governance Challenges in the Sustainable Development (SD) Sector. SD
represents the largest portion of the Bank’s portfolio in Tajikistan, comprising the following subsectors: agriculture, energy, water, and infrastructure. Because governance issues in these subsectors vary widely, generalizations of governance challenges and interventions are often
problematic. Table 3 provides more detail on governance interventions in the SD sub-sectors.
a. Transparency and Accountability: Engaging at the lowest possible level
(microcredit to farmers, support for local banks, installing household energy and
water meters) to increase transparency and improve efficiency of service delivery;
requiring audit of the financial statements of the large energy SOEs (Barki Tajik,
Tajik Gas)
b. Capacity Development: Strengthening government policy development capacity
(cotton debt, competition, land use, role of local government); providing TA for
implementation of the energy policy framework; providing capacity building for
the first Tajik Pamir Private Power Project.
c. Demand for Good Governance: Providing training and information campaigns
for rural populations regarding application for land use certificates and irrigation
investment; supporting community-based organizations to manage communal
water distribution systems
d. In addition, activities that combine capacity development and demand for good
governance include: Building capacity among villagers to become independent
farmers and take management decisions; creating and training Water User
Associations to support improved irrigation; training trainers in environmental
land management
17.
Tackling Governance Challenges in the Human Development (HD) Sector. Though
significantly smaller than the SD portfolio in Tajikistan, the HD sector is a pioneer in tackling
governance challenges in education and health, especially in fostering demand for good
governance by strengthening PTAs, introducing per-capita financing in education, and capacity
development in health. Table 4 lists planned HD-sector governance interventions in detail.
a. Transparency and Accountability: Piloting management autonomy and percapita financing in general education and primary health care; supporting the
development of an Education Management Information System and Health
Management Information System () to enhance accountability by collecting data
on service utilization, financing, and outcomes; supporting provider payment
reforms with tracking of funds; introducing transparent co-payments for health
services
b. Capacity Development: At the central level, providing training to the Ministries
of Health and Education in evidence-based policy making, public procurement,
financial management, and M&E; at the local level, training PTAs and schools to
100

strengthen school autonomy, procurement and financial management; building
fiduciary capacity in health at the oblast level
c. Demand for Good Governance: Supporting participation of PTAs in school
budget allocation; supporting public access to school budgets; communicating to
citizens on progress made in health reforms by building the Ministry of Health
website and developing relationships with the media to report on progress
(opening of new health facilities, training, etc.)
18.
Governance Challenges in PFSD. Though there is no investment lending in this sector,
the Bank has a long-standing engagement on private and financial sector issues in Tajikistan.
Many private sector development activities have been included in the PDPG series, and the Bank
is collaborating closely with (IFC to strengthen the business-enabling environment and improve
the investment climate.
a. Transparency and Accountability: Policy Dialogue on Business Environment
b. Capacity Development: IDF on Capacity Building for State Investment
Committee
c. Demand for Good Governance: Support for Entrepreneur Hotline
V.

ENGAGING ON GOVERNANCE AT THE PROJECT LEVEL

19.
Project-Level Governance Issues in the Context of Country and Sector Level
Governance. As discussed above, governance challenges at the country and sector levels
eventually affect project implementation. Projects are ne instrument for tackling governance
challenges, and this is done through careful project design. The key question becomes: Is a given
project’s design conducive to tackling broader governance challenges and safeguarding against
governance risks?
20.
Governance Checklist. One of the main innovations of the CGAC strategy is the use of
a Governance Checklist (Table 1) to mainstream governance initiatives in all sectors for every
new operation, additional financing, or midterm review. The checklist will be applied to each
new project throughout the project cycle. The responsible manager is denoted in the Checklist at
every stage. The officer’s responsibility will be to ask the Checklist questions and ensure that
the issues at hand are addressed in the project design. The Checklist has two parts: Governance
Challenges and Governance Risks. Where open-ended questions are asked, it is the discretion of
the responsible manager to evaluate whether the project’s treatment of the governance issue is
acceptable. This provision is introduced to recognize that “no one size fits all” projects, and
there must be a certain degree of specificity and flexibility embedded in the Checklist.
21.
Governance Challenges versus Governance Risks. The Governance Checklist
differentiates between governance challenges and governance risks. Challenges are governance
issues that can be addressed during the current CPS period, such as transparency and
accountability, capacity development, and demand for good governance. Risks, on the other
hand, refer to the systemic governance problems that the Bank needs to safeguard against in the
design and implementation of operations, including fiduciary (procurement and financial
101

management) risks and non-fiduciary (political economy) risks. The checklist contains questions
to help identify sectors and projects where additional safeguards, such as political economy
analysis or stakeholder analysis, are necessary.
22.
Strengthening Fiduciary Safeguards. As a complement and prerequisite for the
Governance Checklist, the Bank will continue to work with the government to follow up on the
recommendations of the 2008 CPFR. The Bank Group will work with the government to
implement an action plan for individual projects and will closely monitor implementation to
reduce fiduciary risk. The CMU will identify projects that require enhanced supervision for
contract administration and will develop a list of local and regional technical consultants (e.g.,
engineers, architects) to include in supervision teams. Fiduciary capacity will continue to be
strengthened through continued delivery of regular procurement and financial management
training. The Bank will strengthen supervision of procurement under the portfolio, with special
emphasis on projects where a number of deficiencies have been identified. Moreover, the scope
of external audit by additional third-party assurance should be expanded to include more indepth reviews of systems, procedures and processes, including technical and operational reviews.
The Bank will adopt a norm for implementation of high-risk projects in which a joint fiduciary
review and physical inspection are carried out by independent engineers.
VI.

SCALING UP: GOVERNANCE PARTNERSHIP FACILITY (WINDOW 1)

23.
Two compatible resource scenarios. The strategy outlined above relies on the existing
(limited) IDA and Bank administrative resources. As a CGAC country, however, Tajikistan was
awarded US$2 million in additional financing for governance-related activities from the
Governance Partnership Facility over the CPS period. The CGAC Strategy outlined above
represents a baseline scenario that will benefit tremendously from additional resources to deepen
the Bank’s existing governance engagement.
24.
Mainstreaming Governance in the Tajikistan Portfolio through GPF Window 1
Grant. The grant is designed to implement CGAC strategy beyond the existing interventions in
the portfolio. The grant consists of four components mirror CGAC strategy elements: (i)
Resourcing Governance Checklist, which includes training and manual for TTLs and additional
resources for project-level political economy analysis; (ii) Enhancing Transparency and
Accountability in Key Sectors (Agriculture; Energy; Private Sector Development) that involves
stocktaking of what the Bank is already doing in these sectors, developing sector-wide approach
to transparency and accountability; and resourcing the implementation; (iii) Developing
Capacity: taking stock of what the Bank has done in the field so far and what it should be doing,
leading to designing a comprehensive strategy for WB in capacity development, and eventually
piloting this strategy; (iv) Fostering Demand for Good Governance includes broadening
existing engagement with CSOs (grants for CSOs monitoring of the Bank projects) and
deepening engagement in Social Sectors through scaling up our work with PTAs and via
community health scorecards.
VII.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

25.
Alignment between CPS and CGAC M&E. Because this governance strategy is an
integral part of the CPS, the M&E process will be fully integrated with that of the CPS. As
102

governance interventions are mainstreamed into projects, the CPS results matrix will be used to
assess the implementation of the CGAC strategy at mid-term and at completion. At the country
level, progress on the CGAC strategy will be evaluated against the objectives of the Public
Sector Reform Project, Public Financial Management Modernization Project, PDPG, Public
Finance Voice and Accountability Trust Fund, and IGR. At the sector level, progress toward
sectoral improvements in transparency and accountability, capacity development, and demand
for good governance will be assessed. At the project level, the adoption of governance checklist
and improvement of the fiduciary safeguards will be appraised.
26.
Communication Strategy. The alignment of CPS and CGAC communication strategies
is also crucial, as successful implementation of the CGAC strategy is impossible without a
sustained effort to maintain dialogue on governance and institution building throughout the CPS
period. The CGAC strategy will be a part of CPS consultations with the government and
stakeholders. Continuous dialogue will be supported through the existing program (e.g., PDPG
policy dialogue, workshops for the Public Sector Reform Project and Public Financial
Management Modernization Project, PFVA TF, dissemination of the IGR and CEM, as well as
through occasional governance-related roundtables (e.g., a seminar with the government on
WGI). The Bank team will also engage in regular internal communication on CGAC activities,
especially to support use of the Governance Checklist among task team leaders.

Annex 5: Donor Coordination and Harmonization in Tajikistan
1.
Despite growing foreign aid in Tajikistan, resources – estimated at approximately US$36
per capita in 2006 - remain scarce compared to the development needs. The success of the CPS
implementation will also depend on continued improvements in donor cooperation and
harmonization.
2.
Overseas development assistance (ODA) has increased in terms of the volume of
funding, the number of projects and development partners. Based on the UNDP Principals data,
China has now become the largest donor in Tajikistan, followed by the United Sates. Their
development aid accounts for, respectively, 43 and 15 percent of total aid disbursed during 20032007.35 The WB ranks third (tied with the EC) and accounts for 7 percent. Together, China,
USA, EC and WBG provide an estimated 64 percent of all development aid to Tajikistan. The
IMF, which is ranked fifth, accounts for 5 percent of the total aid. The remaining 31 percent is
comprised of ODA from other agencies, mostly bilateral organizations.
3.
However, aid flows are unpredictable and uneven and impacts of development aid remain
mixed due to ineffective donor engagement and coordination as well as weak government
capacity to absorb and coordinate aid. There is greater scope for better use of aid resources by
improving donor coordination and strengthening government capacity. This annex is organized
as follows: first, it provides a picture of current ODA programs as well as existing coordination
mechanisms in the sector; it then discusses the steps taken by the World Bank to strengthen
government ownership, harmonization, alignment, results and mutual accountability.
A. An Overview of Development Aid under the proposed CPS Strategic Objectives
4.
An overview of major development aid activities in Tajikistan is organized around the
two strategic objectives. The mapping was based on records of aid programs from the sectoral
reviews carried out as part of the JCPS) the latest draft JCPS, and updated information from the
ODA agencies. The purpose of this exercise is to identify potential areas for further Bank
engagement, as well as areas where the role of the Bank Group needs to be delineated.
5.
The overview does not present a comprehensive picture of all activities and areas of
involvement of all development partners active in Tajikistan. The mapping presented in this
Annex does not capture activities of development partners that have smaller programs. In
addition, many development partners only participate in the policy dialogue through the Donor
Coordination Council (DCC) working groups.

35

Total aid disbursed from 2003 to 2007 is estimated at about US$1.7 billion.

114

Strategic Objective 1: Reducing the negative impact of the crisis on poverty and
vulnerability
Result 1: Maintain Fiscal Stability
6.
The ADB, EC, WB and IMF are the major development partners whose financial
assistance through grants, project loans, and/or policy-based program loans contribute to
macroeconomic stability, i.e., management of prudent monetary and fiscal policies. In 2009, their
support has been shifting towards short-term budgetary assistance to address financing gaps in
the balance of payments and fiscal account emerging from the impact of the global economic and
financial crises. The IMF’s ECF for 2009-12 will provide US$70 million in 2009 to boost
international reserves and support the country’s external position. ADB, WB, and EC provided
budget support to Tajikistan in the amount of US$72.5 million in 2009. ADB’s Development
Policy Support Programs and TA projects support policy reforms related to, among others,
customs modernization, revenue administration, macroeconomic management, and public
expenditure issues. The Bank also coordinates closely with the IMF on policy advice and
technical assistance related to macro-economic management, tax administration reforms and
other structural reforms.
Result 2: Maintain access to critical public services
7.
ADB, EC, and the WB have provided budget support to assist the government in
protecting public spending in the social sectors (education, health, and social protection) to
protect recent gains in poverty reduction and social development achieved during the past decade
of strong growth. This effort is also reinforced by ongoing investment activities by several
donors. In the education sector, since 2006, all donors support the government through the
National Strategy for Education Development (NSED) for 2006-2015 and its subsequent action
plan. The FTI Catalytic Fund is providing support to the General Education Reforms through a
US$ 18.4 million trust fund implemented by the Ministry of Education (MoE), administered by
the World Bank and co-led by the WB and UNICEF. Key donor agencies (ADB, GTZ, KfW,
UNICEF, USAID and WB) support a variety of interventions (loans and grants): management
(data collection, including policy analysis, costing, planning and M&E), efficiency, access,
quality, gender parity, and infrastructure. A Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)
linking the NSED to the budget and the Education Management Information System (EFMIS)
were introduced. Per capita financing in general education will be scaled up countrywide in
2010. Joint FTI review became a good example of good donor coordination supporting the
implementation of the NSED and taking pilot initiatives into a broader scale. FTI provides a
basis for future SWAp by bringing donors around the government strategy, moving from the use
of the project systems to the country structure, and building capacity inside those structures.
8.
In the health sector, several development partners including SIDA, SDC, WB, USAID
and KfW actively support the government in strengthening primary health care services, reform
of the health financing system, fighting tuberculosis and malaria, improving maternal and child
health and strengthening family medicine. Additional key partners (WHO and the USAIDfunded ZdravPlus Project) are working on health financing reform. A broader group, which also
includes UNICEF and ADB, has been active as participants in policy dialogue around
implementation of the Basic Benefit Package and per capita financing in the health sector. The
115

Aga Khan Foundation also plays an active role in supporting primary health care and health
financing reform. The EC is supporting health information management and the elaboration of a
MTEF and, together with DFID and other partners, supports the development of a health sector
strategy. ADB and SIDA are planning to phase out their engagement in the health sector in 2009
and 2010, respectively. Efforts are being made to improve development partner coordination and
aid effectiveness in the sector. In 2008, health sector coordination has been evolving from a
development partner driven process with an information sharing output only, to a sector
coordination led by the Ministry of Health with the technical assistance supported by WHO and
the active collaboration of other development partners. Today the dialogue between the Ministry
of Health and development partners is more oriented toward joint planning and implementation
of the key health sector reforms.
Result 3: Reduce risk for vulnerable groups through enhanced social protection
9.
Vulnerable groups are at risk during the crisis. Reduced remittances and economic
growth have led to a decline in their disposable income, and therefore increase risk to food
security, especially in the rural areas. Further, the social system is too weak to provide adequate
protection to the poor. In the areas of food security, there are several donors working together to
provide food to vulnerable groups. UN organizations including UNICEF, FAO, and WFP are the
main donors. IDA and EC are now working together to rehabilitate agricultural infrastructure
(irrigation and drainage systems) in the region to generate employments and income for the
population in time of crisis. In the area of Social Protection, EC has a long-standing engagement
with the government supporting measures to improve efficiency of the Social Assistance System.
Recently, the WB is becoming engaged in this area working closely with EC.
Strategic Objective II: Pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development
Result 4: Strengthen the business enabling environment
10.
Given the broad coverage of the CPS Results Area of Reducing Administrative Barriers
to Doing Business this area has a large confluence of ODA programs. The July 2008 Private and
Financial Sector Review, conducted by the World Bank, mapped 53 initiatives focused on PSD,
36 of which are currently under implementation, representing US$64.7 million for the
(2007Ǧ2009) period. Aside from partnerships on specific operations, the State Investment
Council coordinates at the policy level with all the active players in this area through the
Business Enabling Environment working group, facilitated by IFC with the financial support of
DFID and SECO. The EC, GTZ, OSCE, MSDSP, ADB, SECO and USAID have trade
facilitation and other trade-related assistance that support the country’s overall investment
climate and competitiveness. Other partners, such as the ACTED, AKDN, CARITAS, DFID,
EBRD, EU, GTZ, OSCE, SECO, SIDA, UNDP and USAID, support activities that indirectly
address productivity, livelihood and competitiveness through various entry points such as
support for agricultural productivity, youth employability, sustainable livelihoods, community
enterprises, and other interventions mostly at the grassroots level. Private sector development has
been one of the cross-cutting issues extensively discussed at the DCC. The joint Private Sector
Development Strategy, developed with the government by the WB, identifies the key issues
requiring donor support in the PSD area in the coming years.

116

11.
In the financial sector, donors currently involved in the area of regulatory reform include
ADB, USAID and the WB, while virtually all donors active in the financial sector (ADB, EBRD,
GTZ, IFC, KfW, USAID, and SECO) have contributed to advance microfinance in Tajikistan
through various types of projects. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has
provided support to the WBG through IFC’s South Tajikistan Cotton Lending Project, which has
increased private bank lending to the critical agricultural sector, and SECO supported IFC's
Azerbaijan and Central Asia Leasing Project, which led to strong growth in Tajikistan's leasing
sector.
Result 5: Improve conditions for a sustainable increase in agricultural productivity
12.
In agriculture, key donor agencies include the multilaterals (the WB, EC, the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), UNDP, and FAO), bilateral donors (USAID, GTZ, SDC, DFID,
SIDA, and NGOs), and the Aga Khan Foundation (see Agriculture Sector Review). SIDA, ECA
and ADB have expressed their intention to disengage from this sector in the future. ADB and the
WB are currently the two largest donors in the cotton sector, with commitments of US$120 and
US$55 million, respectively. There is no comprehensive agricultural sector policy or strategy
agreed on by the government and other key stakeholders to serve as a coordination tool.
However, mechanisms to facilitate better cooperation and coordination are only now emerging
with the Donor Coordination Council (DCC) Agricultural Sub-group, which was created in late
2007, and the three joint DCC-Government Working Groups on land reform/irrigation, finance
and debt resolution, and the informal Legal Aid Center Coordination Group. Two DFID funded
long-term consultants are also assisting in donor coordination. Additionally, donors are working
towards consolidating PIUs in the sector. For example, the WB and ADB have a joint PIU for
the sector.
13.
Only a few partners have specific programs on Disaster Risk Management -- UN, EC.
However, the development community, with actors such as FAO, WFP and UNICEF, is prompt
to bring an emergency response to crises (the devastating rains in May 2009 and the food crisis
in 2008). Yet disaster preparedness and contingency planning are areas that are currently not
being fully supported by the donor community. The WB, through its ongoing avian flu project, is
providing some support.
Result 6: Improve the reliability of electricity and gas and increase energy export
potential
14.
IFI/Donor interest in the energy sector has been limited and is mainly providing support
for rehabilitation of existing systems and improving efficiency under the Energy Loss Reduction
Project (WB/Swiss SECO), Pamir Private Power Project (WB/IFC/Swiss SECO/AKFED),
Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance Project (WB), and Energy Rehabilitation (ADB)). The
development partners active in the sector have been ADB, IsDB, KfW, Kuwait Fund for Arabic
Economic Development, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the WB, in addition to
the newcomers Iran, China (PRC) and the Russian Federation. ADB and WB have been
particularly involved in regional energy trade. ADB, with commitments of about US$60 million
in the energy sector, along with KfW (US$40 million) are the most active donors with activities
ranging from power distribution in urban areas to regional energy trade initiatives. Currently,
there is no formal development partner coordination mechanism in the energy sector. A
117

centralized Project Management Unit (PMU) reporting to the President’s Office has been
established to manage energy sector projects, except those financed by the WB that are
implemented by Barki Tojik and Tajik Gas. The WB’s activities mainly focused on policy
dialogue (e.g., corporatization of the energy utilities, energy tariff adjustment program) as well
as specific investments targeted at commercial loss reduction (e.g., Energy Loss Reduction
Project) and operations efficiency enhancements (e.g., Energy Emergency Recovery Assistance
Project). It had prepared an energy sector development policy advisory note for the government
that sets the directions for the development of energy sector on a two-track basis: (i)
strengthening of the domestic energy sector through tariff adjustments to cost viability levels,
energy loss reduction program implementation, improvement of financial management systems
and corporate governance, and (ii) export orientation of new hydro/thermal energy projects. The
government, with the help of its international consortium of advisors led by Taylor-DeJongh, is
preparing a comprehensive two-pronged strategy that would encompass both short-term and
medium-to-long term sets of measures.
Result 7: Improve the provision of safe water in Dushanbe and selected
municipalities
15.
SDC/SECO has been the main actors in the sector among the IFIs and bilateral agencies.
Their involvement include: (i) a regional rural water supply project and improvement of
community-based water supply systems in the south Muminobad rayon; (ii) support to “UNDP
rural water supply dialogue” to bring together key governmental institutions, donors and
organizations working in the field of drinking water; and (iii) grant co-financing to Khujand
water supply improvement project; and (iv) co-financing of a new EBRD-financed rural water
supply project (through its Khujand water supply project, phase 1 and 2; and a new project for
Kulyab, Dangara and Kurgan Tube, scheduled for approval in 2009). JICA supports the
reconstruction of rural water supply systems in Khamadoni rayon of Khatlon oblast; regular
training of sector professionals in Japan; and Master Plan and Feasibility study of sustainable
supply of drinking water to South districts of Khatlon region, including proposal for feasibility
study for reconstruction of Vakhsh trunk main). The WB currently finances the Dushanbe water
supply and the Municipal Infrastructure Development project (includes water supply and
sanitation components in 8 regional cities). There is currently no formal development partner
coordination mechanism in the water supply and sanitation sector. The Water Supply and
Sanitation Sector Strategy Workshop, conducted by the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan in April 2009 was the first initiative in the country to focus attention of both the
Government and the donor community on Tajik water supply and sanitation, and, in particular,
on the priorities, included in the Tajikistan water supply and sanitation sector note, prepared by
the government with financing by the World Bank; and to bring together the government and the
donor community. To strengthen donor coordination similar workshops will be conducted on an
annual basis during the CPS period.
Result 8: Strengthen the quality of public services to enhance human capital
potential
16.
Donor activities in the education and health sectors have contributed to two results under
both strategic objectives: reducing the negative impact of the crisis, and paving the way to
sustained post-crisis recovery. Their activities contributed to improvements in the quality of
118

education and health services, thus enhancing the human capital potential that is required to
support economic growth. Compared to efforts to strengthen basic and secondary education (see
strategic outcome 12), Vocational and Technical Education (VTE) has received comparatively
marginal attention. Currently, the only existing coordinating tool of the government is the Labor
Market and Migration Policy, which is being finalized. The WB’s Life Skills Development for
Future Migrants project (financed by Russia) will provide training to Tajik migrants on basic life
skills to improve Russian language skills and knowledge of that country’s laws and procedures.
Result 9: Strengthen incentives for better performance of civil servants
17.
Improving the Performance of Public Sector is another area where multiple partners are
engaged, and the forms of engagement include technical assistance for local planning and
expenditure management, local government financing, and budget reforms at the provincial and
municipal levels. Active development partners here include ADB, Sweden, UK, UN, and the
USA. ADB has a program loan and technical assistance for local government financing and
budget reforms. Most assistance is directed through sector support. However, the Public Sector
Reform Project supports the implementation of reforms envisaged by the Public Administration
Reform Strategy (2006) in the areas of restructuring of state agencies, reform of civil service
administration, pay reform, and strengthening strategic policy coordination.
Result 10: Improve transparency and accountability in public financial
management
18.
On Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management, the
EC and the WB are leading the efforts working closely with other partners. There are many
active development partners but all resources are aligned with the priorities identified in the
Public Financial Management Strategy for 2009-2018 and the Public Financial Management
Project. The WB’s Public Finance Management Project (US$5 million) is co-financed by DFID
and the EC (US$5.5 million). Additional financing in the amount US$0.97 million comes from a
PHRD Grant for project preparation. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs expressed
willingness to participate in financing PFM reforms in close coordination with the WB, the EC
and DFID through a Swiss Trust Fund.
B. Implementing the Paris Declaration in the 2009-2013 CPS
19.
Tajikistan has signed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness on ownership,
harmonization, alignment, results and mutual accountability. The government is committed to
the Paris Declaration and the subsequent 2008 Accra Agenda for Action and its implementation.
20.
Although donor coordination mechanisms are present in many sectors of intervention of
the new CPS (as described in the previous section), a recent study on aid effectiveness in
Tajikistan concluded that there is scope for better use of aid resources. Overall, the findings
suggest that improving coordination, both in terms of planning, joint implementation, monitoring
and evaluation, would bring benefits. Currently, development partner fragmentation in many
sectors creates considerable coordination challenges and costs for the government. Some aid
remains supply driven and the lack of predictability creates problems for government planning.

119

21.
The CPS will benefit from a strong coordination mechanism through a JCPS supported
by an important number of donors36 that is currently being completed and formulates “the
principles and mechanisms that will guide the delivery of aid to Tajikistan, the cooperation
between the Government of Tajikistan and the development partners, and the coordination
mechanism to be used to implement the commitments of the Paris Declaration as expressed in
the core principles.” Box 1 outlines a shared list of principles of aid effectiveness.
Box 1: Draft Shared Principles of Aid Effectiveness
to Assure Ownership, Harmonization, Alignment, Results and Mutual Accountability
1.

Tajik authorities will take the lead in coordinating donor assistance in support of and aligned with the priorities of the
NDS and PRS, and clarifying key points of contact between donors and the overall Government structure.
2. Donors will provide support to enhance Government’s capacity for coordination and will provide timely information
on their budgets and activities to allow effective government planning, monitoring and reporting on aid projects,
programs and flows.
3. Tajik authorities, with the support of donors, will link the annual national budget, public investment program and aidsupported programs in an integrated programming process for greater realism, relevance and consistency.
4. In specific sectors Donors will work with Government towards a sector-wide approach of: one strategy, one
coordination point and one M&E framework, including : (i) agreeing on sector strategies endorsed by Government;
(ii) moving towards clearer division of labor, and (iii) joint monitoring and evaluation of sector programs.
5. Donors will work towards ensuring that Technical Assistance is demand-driven and responds to national needs
6. Donors will focus on scaling-up successful project interventions for policy development and nation-wide outcomes
where appropriate and feasible. Scaled up programs will be designed for sustainability and with clear linkages to
policy-based and results-based budgeting
7. Government and donors will not only monitor outputs over a 12-month period but measure outcomes within the
medium-term framework of the JCPS, and the MTEF where it exists
8. Donors will develop common arrangements for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring, evaluating and
reporting on donor activities and aid flows. They will promote joint missions, diagnostic reviews and training
activities.
9. Tajik authorities and donors will work together to integrate project preparation and implementation management fully
into the ministerial structures and processes and reduce the number of project implementation units by creating joint
units responsible for multiple projects.
10. Donors will seek to provide predictable, multi-year programmatic financial support and support Government’s efforts
to improve fiduciary systems to increase the flow of funds directly into the budget
11. Tajik authorities and donors will jointly consult with a wide range of stakeholders (including Parliament, local
government and communities, academic institutions, civil society, the diplomatic and aid community) in planning,
implementing, monitoring and evaluating donor supported programs
12. Donors agree to hold themselves to greater self accountability to monitor if aid coordination is meeting national goals
and objectives (through Paris Declaration and IDA indicators)
13. Donors will support the Government to ensure its greater accountability and transparency to the citizens of Tajikistan

1.

Country Level Policy Dialogue

22.
The DCC was established in early 2006. Among others, its objectives are to (i) promote
country ownership through joint dialogue, (ii) enhance harmonization through promoting joint
activities and ultimately, sector wide approaches (SWAp), (iii) secure future alignment through
supporting country systems reforms, (iv) facilitate networking and broader collaboration within
the donor community, and (v) align country strategies of the donors through a single country
36

The JCPS is being developed with the combined support of ADB, EC, Sweden (SIDA), SDC, DFID, WB and the
UN and include the Government of Tajikistan represented by the Chairman of the State Investment and Property
Management Committee.

120

operational strategy. The DCC meets biweekly with an annually rotating chairmanship, currently
chaired by DFID. To facilitate the process, a core DCC group, comprising members representing
the WB, ADB, SIDA, DFID and SDC/Seco, has been set up.
23.
The DCC has had good dialogue with the government on PRSP2 development and has
proven to be an efficient mechanism in coordinating donor activities. It has also been involved in
various sector issues, such as cotton debt and land reform initiatives. Donor coordination is well
advanced at the national level through Monitoring and Evaluation of PRSP (joint ADB-ECDFID mission) and at the sector level in education, health, and energy. The JCPS is identifying
good practices behind the success of this donor coordination (e.g., systematic Chairmanship by
Government representatives), and hoping that coordination in other sectors will benefit from
these practices.
24.
One of the lessons learned from the first PRSP pointed to the need for a single
government counterpart or agency responsible for coordinating with donors. The State
Committee on Investments and Public Property is now assuming this function. It is in charge not
only of the dialogue with the donors on issues related to monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation of the Paris Declaration, but also to perform a coordinating role in this field
within the government. The Aid Coordination Unit remains the focal point on information
management related to donor assistance.
2.

Developing Country Systems

25.
Procurement. The latest Tajikistan CPAR was prepared in 2003. It recommended the
gradual decentralization of public procurement to procuring entities. With technical assistance
and financial support from the Bank, the necessary conditions conducive to transparent,
economic, and efficient public procurement in the country were created. A comprehensive public
procurement law (PPL) that is consistent with international standards was adopted in March
2006. Subsequently, implementation regulations and Standard Bidding Documents (prepared in
Russian language and translated into Tajik and English) according to the new law were
developed with the support from the Bank; they were approved and registered with the Ministry
of Justice in January 2008. The capacity of the Procurement Agency was strengthened: five staff
were trained as trainers in designing and delivering training to public officials at all levels of
government in conducting procurement according to the law.
26.
Efforts by the government to improve transparency in procurement bidding include
organization of the public procurement workshops and initial procurement training for procuring
entities and different levels of public officials; publication and dissemination of new PPL,
introduction of implementation regulations and SBDs; and raising awareness of the procuring
entities on the provisions of public procurement law. In June 2007 the government established
the Qualification Committee to give the status of qualified procurement entity. At the moment 7
agencies have received such a status. To speed up further implementation of the new PPL and
decentralize the procurement responsibility, the PA will prepare the national training strategy for
public procurement, covering all the levels of administration and implement and deliver the
training programs. It appears, however, that the PA’s own funds are not enough for sustaining
and further developing the public procurement system reform program; there is certainly a need
for more funding to complete the decentralization of the procurement responsibility. The World
121

Bank IDF grant to the TJ Public Procurement Agency was closed in FY08. It will assess the
financial and technical assistance needs for the Public Procurement Agency during the CPS
period.
27.
Financial Management. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for
Tajikistan 2003 concluded that the country’s fiduciary environment is extremely weak and the
risk to public funds is high. The findings, supported by PEFA of 2007, point out that systems of
public accountability function poorly and public sector transparency is still a problem at all
levels of government. Most project implementing entities use the cash basis of accounting,
which in most cases is sufficient for proper accounting of project resources and expenditures.
28.
Internal and External Control. The internal audit function has been established within
the Ministry of Finance (Internal Control & Audit Department), and carries out inspections in
budget organizations, mainly to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The internal audit
function is still weak and focuses on regularity in individual transactions rather than on systemic
issues and on effectiveness with which public resources are used. The EU has been working with
the government to develop a strategy for improving internal control and audit. External audit is
practiced by the Agency for Financial Control and Anti Corruption (formerly State Financial
Control Committee), the equivalent of a Supreme Audit Institution (SAI). However, this
agency’s capacity is weak and its conduct of audit is not reliable. As a result, audits of IDA
portfolio have been performed by private audit firms pre-qualified by the Bank and contracted by
the Committee for Investments. It conducts a block audit of WB financed projects in Tajikistan.
29.
To minimize financial risk, there has been a need to “ring fence” financial resources in
Bank projects in order to provide the appropriate fiduciary safeguards. Most Bank-financed
projects in Tajikistan are implemented through stand-alone project implementing agencies that
install parallel accounting systems to those used in the respective line ministries. The project
implementing entities use the cash basis of accounting, which is not in accordance with IFRS,
but is allowed under IPSAS, and in many cases sufficient for proper project accounting. A small
number of projects are implemented by borrower/recipient agencies, which are required to
follow WB financial management procedures rather than the country’s financial management
systems.
30.
Based on assessments of the country PFM system, only some elements of the country FM
systems are planned to be used under the project. These include budgeting and treasury system
for payments in local currency. Full use of the country PFM systems for project implementation
will be considered, as the government progresses with the implementation of the PFM reforms,
some of which are included under the PFMM.
31.
The strength of safeguards systems have not yet formally been assessed by the Donor’s
community.

122

3.

Effective and Inclusive Partnerships for Development

32.
The Tajikistan regular Consultative Group (CG) and Development Forums have served
as an effective mechanism for facilitating substantive policy dialogue on the country’s
development agenda. However, representation still needs to be broadened to include
representatives from civil society, academia, private sector and the legislature.
33.
Aside from the bi-annual PDF event, working group meetings are held around thematic
areas - MDGs and social progress; growth and investment climate; economic and fiscal reforms;
governance and anticorruption; decentralization and local government; sustainable rural
development throughout the year to follow through on issues and agreements reached and
facilitate consultations across a broad range of stakeholders. Each working group is typically
convened by the head of the relevant government agency and a development partner as coconvener. Key initiatives and achievements of the Working Groups are discussed in the section
on development aid programs in the context of the CPS.
4.

Mutual Accountability and Managing for Results

34.
Specific modalities for joint operational engagement by donors can increase effectiveness
and reduce the costs of implementation for the government and donors. A good example of this
type of synergy comes from the joint WB-ADB portfolio reviews that have been alleviating the
weight on government implementing and oversight agencies.
35.
The recent Aid Effectiveness Study suggests there are high transaction costs for aid in the
country, particularly given capacity constraints. In an effort to address this imbalance, and
maximize the impact of the aid available, the government and donors jointly reviewed current
overall coordination mechanisms and concluded that a number of improvements need to be
made. This included greater use of sector working groups, joint missions and diagnostic reviews,
as well as developing common arrangements for planning, funding, disbursement, monitoring,
evaluating and reporting on donor activities and aid flows. Currently, donors are considering
joint project implementation units in the context of SWAps in the health and education sectors,37
but much work remains to be done to ensure the conditions are right for success. Before this
approach can be effective, JCPS partners agree that certain prerequisites need to be in place to
achieve sustainable results, including: (i) a strong prioritized country-led sector strategy; (ii)
strong country systems for absorbing resources (fiduciary and procurement); (iii) sector
strategies that is rationalized, fully costed and linked to a medium-term budget expenditure
framework; and (iv) improved aid harmonization, particularly for monitoring and information
systems. The overall objective is to put in place sustainable mechanisms that will lower the cost
of aid and improve donor effectiveness.
37

A SWAp is an approach to support a country-led program for a coherent sector in a comprehensive and
coordinated manner. It is characterized by: (i) country-owned sector policies and strategies; (ii) a sustained, countryled partnership among development partners and key stakeholders; (iii) a common program and an expenditure
framework (usually a medium-term framework and an annual budget) based on agreed priorities and strategies; (iv)
a financing plan that aligns government’s and external resources under the common program; and (v) significant
movement toward common approaches in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation with increasing
reliance on country’s systems and procedures.
