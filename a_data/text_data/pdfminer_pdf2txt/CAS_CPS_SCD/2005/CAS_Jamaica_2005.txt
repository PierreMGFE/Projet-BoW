Executive Summary 

1. 
Jamaica’s economic performance has imp roved since the CAS Progress Repo r t 
in 2002. Rea l GDP g r ow t h has accelerated f r om 1 percent in 2001/02 t o 2 percent in 
2003/04 and i s p ro jec ted t o be 1.5 percent in 2004/05 in spite o f the impac t o f Hu r r icane 
Ivan . Jamaica’s med ium - te rm g r ow t h prospects are generally good and im p r o v i n g as a 
result o f s ign i f ican t p lanned investments in key sectors i n c l u d i n g tourism, baux i te 
mining, telecommunications, powe r generation and infrastructure. Oppo r tun i t ies are also 
expected t o be created by the fo rma t ion o f the Caribbean S ing le Market and Economy 
(CSME), an economic u n i o n o f Caribbean countries w h i c h w i l l fac i l i ta te the f r e e 
movement o f people, capital, goods and services. The t rans i t ion t o the Free Trade A rea 
o f the Ame r icas (FTAA) m a y also u n l o c k economic oppo r tun i t ies f o r Jamaica. 

2. 
Howeve r , Jamaica 
faces ongo ing and eme rg ing challenges w h i c h cou ld 
comp rom ise i t s longe r - te rm g r ow t h prospects. One o f the m a j o r challenges i s the large 
debt burden-one o f the highest ra t ios o f to ta l debt t o GDP and domestic debt t o GDP in 
the wo r ld . A c h i e v i n g sustained g r ow t h w i l l i n v o l v e dea l ing w i t h the g r ow i n g debt 
burden o n an urgent basis. Ano the r m a j o r challenge i s the high leve ls o f c r ime and 
violence w h i c h are estimated t o cost society at least 4 percent o f GDP. C r ime and 
violence a re la rge ly concentrated amongst the poorest in society and amongst young 
males (14-24 years) w h o o f ten tend t o be the v ic t ims as w e l l as the perpetrators o f v io len t 
crime. Poo r educational outcomes are also a ma jo r challenge w i t h w h i c h Jamaica must 
contend in order t o im p r o v e competitiveness and reduce pove r ty . T h e performance o f 
Jamaica’s economy i s also l i k e l y t o be impac ted b y the reduc t ion in trade preferences f o r 
tw o o f i t s ma jo r exports-sugar 
and bananas. As a sma l l open economy in the 
Caribbean, Jamaica i s p rone t o b o t h ex te rna l economic shocks as w e l l as natural disasters 
that c o u l d have severe nega t ive impac ts o n the economy. The recent Hu r r icane I v a n 
(w i t h damage estimated at 8 percent o f GDP) was a stark rem inde r o f this vu lne rab i l i ty . 

3. 
The Government o f Jamaica has articulated a M e d i u m T e r m Socio-Economic 
P o l i c y F ramewo rk (MTSEPF ) cove r ing the pe r iod April 2004 t o M a r c h 2009. This 
p o l i c y framework, a imed at respond ing t o the m a j o r ongo ing and eme rg ing challenges 
fac ing Jamaica, resulted f r o m w i d e p u b l i c consultations and en joys strong dono r support. 
I t p rov ides a systematic and comprehensive approach t o the deve lopmen t o f the coun t ry 
in the medium-term.

The W o r l d B a n k G r o u p C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy f o r FY06-09

T h e strategy also emphasizes the tw o cross-cutting themes o f governance and 
env i ronmen ta l sustainability. The strategy i s the resu l t o f close co l labo ra t ion w i t h the 
government and has bene f i ted f r o m w ide consultations w i t h c i v i l society and other 
donors. In recogn i t ion o f the limited f isca l space, the p rog ram i s focused, addressing 
only k e y p r i o r i t y areas that have strong ownership, n o t j u s t w i t h i n the Government, but 
also w i t h i n the Oppos i t ion and c i v i l society.

JAMA ICA : WORLD BANK GROUP 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR FY06-09 

I. Overview 

1. 
Jamaica has recen t ly emerged f r o m a f inanc ia l c r is is f o l l ow i n g a l o n g pe r iod o f 
d isappo in t ing GD P g row th . Previous B a n k assistance has focus o n res to r ing growth, 
p ro tec t ing the poor, im p r o v i n g governance and env i ronmen ta l sustainability. G r ow t h has 
returned and some progress has been made in p ro tec t ing the poo r th rough an imp roved 
social safety ne t program. There have also been some imp rovemen ts in governance, 
i n c l u d i n g better de l ive ry o f p u b l i c services through Execu t ive Agencies. In order t o reap 
fu r the r sustained reduc t ion in pove r ty , Jamaica needs t o accelerate inc lus ive growth, 
imp rove human development and oppo r tun i ty , and reduce c r ime and violence. Howeve r , 
there are enormous challenges presented b y the la rge debt overhang and the consequent 
l im i t e d f isca l space. In addition, Jamaica’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o na tu ra l disasters and external 
economic shocks are con t inu ing challenges. 
2. 
The Government has articulated a M e d i um - T e rm Soc io -Econom ic P o l i c y 
F ramewo rk that attempts t o respond t o these challenges. The W o r l d B a n k Group’s 
support t o Jamaica-a highly indeb ted m i d d l e income country-builds 
o n this f ramewo rk 
and p rov ides a ve ry focused p rog ram over the p e r i o d FY06-09 based o n three mu tua l ly 
re in fo rc ing pillars: (i) accelerating inc lus ive econom ic g row th ; (ii) im p r o v i n g human 
development and oppo r tun i ty ; and (iii) c r ime p reven t ion and reduction. 

11. The Country Context 

Political Context 

3. 
Jamaica has been a stable democracy since i t s independence in 1962. The People’s 
Na t iona l Pa r ty (PNP), w h i c h has been in powe r since 1989, i s e n j o y i n g an unprecedented 
fou r th t e rm o f office h a v i n g been re-elected in October 2002, a lbe i t w i t h a smaller 
ma jo r i ty - 34 o f 60 seats, d o w n f r o m 48. In the L o c a l Gove rnmen t elections o f June 16, 
2003 the Jamaica L a b o u r Pa r ty (JLP) w o n 12 o f the 13 l o c a l councils, thereby taking 
con t ro l o f l o c a l gove rnmen t f r o m the PNP. The J LP has since los t one c o u n c i l t o the 
PNP in a Novembe r 2004 by -e lec t ion . The nex t general elections a re cons t i tu t iona l ly due 
b y 2007. L o c a l Gove rnmen t elections are l i k e l y t o b e h e l d sooner a l though there i s n o 
f i x e d date. The t w o m a i n p o l i t i c a l parties are l i k e l y t o have n ew leaders g o i n g i n t o the 
nex t general elections. T h e oppos i t ion JLP has already elected a n ew leader and i t i s 
expected that the PNP w i l l elect a n ew leader w h e n P r im e M i n i s t e r Patterson retires 
sometime before the end o f his t e rm in 2007. 
4. 
B o t h the Gove rnmen t and the oppos i t ion share v iews o n the m a j o r challenges 
fac ing Jamaica, inc lud ing : the la rge debt, the high leve ls o f c r im e and violence and the 
poo r educational outcomes. B o t h p o l i t i c a l parties also s t rong ly support the need f o r 
pub l ic sector re fo rm . T h e Gove rnmen t appears t o support a mo re gradual approach, 
inc lud ing r e l y i n g o n a t t r i t ion , t o address the size o f the p u b l i c sector. T h e opposition, o n 

4 

the other hand, has argued f o r a more rad ica l approach t o addressing the size o f the pub l ic 
sector, i n c l u d i n g a reduc t ion in the number o f Cabinet posts, m in is t r ies and departments.

Jamaica’s economic performance has im p r o v e d since the C A S Progress Repo r t in 
2002. R e a l GDP g r ow t h accelerated f r o m 1 percent in 2001/02 t o 2 percent in 2003/04 
and i s p ro jec ted at 1.5 percent in 2004/05, rev ised d ow nw a r d f r o m 2.5 percent due t o the 
impac t o f Hu r r icane I v a n in September 2004. The imp rovemen t in g r ow t h i s be ing l e d b y 
re la t ive ly s t rong performance in tourism, mining, ag r icu l tu re and the recovery in the 
manu fac tu r ing sector. 
6. 
T h e f isca l s i tua t ion has also imp roved . The cen t ra l government’s ove ra l l p u b l i c 
sector d e f i c i t was reduced f r o m 10.8 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 t o 8.7 percent in 2003/04 
and i s p ro jec ted at 7.9 percent in 2004-05. The p r im a r y surplus has imp roved f r o m 7 
percent in 2002/03 t o 10.8 percent o f GDP in 2003/04. The imp rovemen t in the f isca l 
balance re f lec ted h ighe r revenues, i n c l u d i n g f r o m add i t iona l tax measures, as w e l l as 
con ta inmen t in expenditure. P rov is iona l data f o r the f i rs t h a l f o f 2004105 suggest further 
imp rovemen ts in revenues and continued con ta inmen t in expenditure, despite the impac t 
o f Hu r r icane Ivan , lead ing t o a fu r the r increase in the cen t ra l Government’s primary 
surplus t o 11.3 percent o f GDP . This f o l l ow s a sustained e f f o r t by the Government in 
running p r im a r y f isca l surpluses in excess o f 7 percent o f GDP f o r the last f i v e years. 
The size o f the ove ra l l pub l ic sector debt i s one o f the ma jo r challenges faced b y the 
Government. Jamaica’s debt, wh ich has been inc reas ing steadily since the 1996/97 
f inanc ia l sector crisis, hit a new h i g h o f about 146 percent o f GDP in 2002103. The sharp 
g r ow t h in the debt was fue led b y rising wages and salary costs as w e l l as the sharp 
increases in domestic interest rates w h i c h peaked at a round 34 percent at the end o f 
2002/03. This interest rate increase resulted f r o m the Cen t ra l Bank’s e f fo r ts t o stem 
pressure o n the cu r rency w h i c h came unde r severe pressure in ea r ly 2003, depreciating b y 
almost 2 0 percent be tween April and M a y . A p p r o x im a t e l y 25 percent o f the debt 
consists o f variable-rate instruments l i n k e d t o the s i x -m o n t h Treasury b i l l y ie ld . Pa r t ly 
re f lec t ing the doub le -d ig i t inflation, the p u b l i c debt t o GDP r a t i o i s p ro jec ted t o decline 
f r o m 143 percent in 2003/04 t o 137 percent in 2004/05.

Interest rates have s tab i l ized at around 15 pe rcen t in 2004/05. The mode ra t ion o f 
interest rates in part reflects the market’s confidence in the government’s comm i tmen t t o 
a tighter f isca l p o l i c y and that the p u b l i c sector b o r r ow i n g requirement i s l i k e l y t o be

10. T h e Government has im p r o v e d f inanc ia l sector regu la t ion and supe rv is ion since the

raised t o 10 percent o f r isk -we igh ted cap i ta l (1999); recogn i t ion o f non -pe r fo rm ing loans 
was tightened to 3 mon ths f r o m 6 months; stronger guidelines were issued f o r 
p rov is ion ing , loan renegotiation, suspension o f accrued interest o n non -pe r fo rm ing loans 
and l o a n w r i te -o f fs ; and limits o n connected lending and concen t ra t ion o f lend ing have 
been introduced. Rega rd ing the non -bank intermediaries, the Gove rnmen t has enacted an 
Insurance L a w t o serve as the basis f o r regu la t ion and supervision in the sector. In 2001, 
the F inanc ia l Services Comm iss ion was established t o regulate and supervise securities, 
insurance and pensions. The strengthening o f b a n k regu la t ion and supe rv is ion as w e l l as 
the regu la t ion and supe rv is ion o f the non -bank sector has corrected m a n y o f the p rob lems 
w h i c h ex is ted p r i o r t o the f inanc ia l c r is is and i d e n t i f i e d in the 2001 assessment o f the

11. Strong reforms but benefits lagging. Since the mid-eighties, Jamaica has made 
remarkable progress o n f i r s t generation reforms i n c l u d i n g trade and fo re ign exchange 
l ibe ra l iza t ion . As ind ica ted above, f o l l ow i n g a f inanc ia l c r is is in 1996197, the authorities 
have taken s ign i f ican t steps to strengthen the regu la to ry env i ronmen t and supervisory 
ins t i tu t ions i n c l u d i n g the Cen t ra l Bank . The regu la to ry env i ronmen t f o r business has also 
been substantially imp roved . Jamaica has been c i ted as one o f the ten countries w h i c h 
regulate the least ow i n g t o i t s aggressive adoption o f best practice regu la t ion over the last 
decade. 
12. No tw i ths tand ing these r e f o rm measures, Jamaica has n o t reaped the i r benefits due 
in large measure t o a series o f exogenous shocks and the f inanc ia l crisis. Jamaica has 
been saddled w i t h a large debt overhang, la rge ly the legacy o f the f inanc ia l crisis but also 
due t o the assumption of some contingent l iab i l i t ies and high wage cost f r o m a b loa ted 
p u b l i c sector. The high cost o f se rv ic ing the debt has n o t o n l y squeezed expenditure in 
the k e y soc ia l sectors i n c l u d i n g education and hea l th but has also limited p u b l i c 
investment t o less than 2 percent o f GDP-a

Poverty Trends 

13. Growth has improved but poverty has increased. Desp i te the re tu rn to pos i t ive 

GDP g r ow t h in 2000 f o l l o w i n g several years o f negative g row th , the rate o f pove r ty 
increased-moving 
f r o m 16.8 percent in 2001 t o 19.7 percent in 20022 (see F igu re 1). 
This development i s in sharp contrast t o developments f r o m 1991 t o 2001 when, despite a 
stagnant economy, Jamaica reduced the rate o f pove r ty b y ha l f . Howeve r , as the 2004 
Coun t ry Econom ic M em o r a n d um (CEM ) po in ts out, m a n y o f the 
favorable 
circumstances that reduced pove r ty between 1991 and 2001, i n c l u d i n g l o w i n f l a t i o n 
(resulting la rge ly f r o m a reduc t ion in re la t ive f o o d prices), and g r ow t h o f the i n f o rm a l 
sector are u n l i k e l y t o con t inue in the future. 
14. In Jamaica, the p r o f i l e o f the poor, as established by the annual Survey o f L iv ing 
Cond i t ions (SLC), a l i v i n g standards measurement survey, makes clear that there are 
several interrelated factors l i n k e d t o poverty-large 
households, households headed by 
females, inequ i t ies in access t o hea l th and education services, l o w educational attainment, 
unemployment, especially among youth, unde remp loymen t among the w o r k i n g poo r and 
dependence o n i n f o rm a l sector and/or r u r a l emp loymen t . In addition, the poo r t y p i c a l l y

infrastructure; l im i t e d access t o qua l i ty education; h ighe r rates o f adult i l l i te racy ; and 
mo re l i m i t e d emp loymen t opportunities. This im p l i e s that r u r a l pove r ty cannot b e f i x e d

Prospects fo r Fu tu re G row th 

20. Hu r r icane I v a n o f September 2004 t r immed GDP in 2004105 as a resu l t o f 
temporary d is rup t ions in k e y sectors inc lud ing tourism, baux i te mining, agriculture and 
u t i l i t ies . Howeve r , the med ium - te rm g r ow t h prospects f o r Jamaica are generally good 
and im p r o v i n g as a r e s u l t o f s ign i f ican t planned investments in k e y sectors i n c l u d i n g 
tourism, baux i te mining, telecommunications, p ow e r generation and infrastructure 
(p r ima r i ly roads, seaports and airports). Howeve r , ach iev ing and ma in ta in ing h ighe r 
g r ow t h th rough the long - te rm i s l i k e l y t o be h inde red by the la rge debt overhang. This 
reflects three elements. 
21. First, high p u b l i c debt tends t o c rowd -ou t p r iva te inves tmen t and reduces bank 
incentives f o r f inanc ing p r iva te investment and entrepreneurs t o take risk, since l o w risk, 
high returns are available o n government debt. High p u b l i c debt and the segmentation o f 
the credit ma rke t have p robab ly affected mos t ly sma l l bo r rowe rs w h o are r i s k i e r and 
unable t o access fo re ign c red i t markets. 
22. Second, w i t h i n the p u b l i c budget, the high debt se rv ic ing a r is ing f r o m the debt has 
c rowded ou t p u b l i c sector inves tmen t (w h i c h fe l l t o a l o w o f about 1 percent o f GDP in 
2003/04). This reduces “crowding-in”, 
the p o s i t i v e impac t o f p u b l i c o n p r iva te 
investment, such as in tou r ism . Con t inued inadequacy o f in f ras t ruc tu re (w h i c h i s at least 
pa r t ly a func t ion o f p u b l i c investment) also increases the cost o f do ing business and 
makes the economy less compe t i t ive . 
23. S im i la r ly , as discussed in the 2005 Pub l ic Expend i tu re R e v i ew (PER), debt 
servicing has c rowded o u t expenditure o n hea l th and education in the budget, even 
though Jamaica has s t r ived ve ry hard t o ma in ta in such expenditure. The upshot i s that 
the non-salary component o f hea l th and education expend i tu re has been squeezed, and 
this can impac t long - te rm competitiveness th rough the q u a l i t y o f the labo r force. 
24. Third, Jamaica’s g r ow t h prospects c o u l d also b e adversely a f fec ted b y other factors 
inc lud ing external shocks f r o m h ighe r in te res t rates in the in te rna t iona l cap i ta l market, 
increases in the p r ice o f o i l o r na tu ra l disasters t o w h i c h Jamaica i s prone and w h i c h 
cou ld have an adverse e f fec t o n the key g r ow t h sectors. Domes t ic shocks such as social 
ins tab i l i ty o r an increase in the l e v e l o f c r ime and v io lence m a y also impac t the longe r 
te rm g row th prospects. 

Ongoing and Emerging Challenges and Issues

challenges a n d issues w h i c h are impac t ing o r l i k e l y t o impac t o n Jamaica’s development 
agenda in the short, medium and l o n g term. 
26. 
The analysis in the recent C E M (2004) 
suggests tha t sustained g r ow t h w i l l be fundamental t o fu r the r declines in pove r ty . 
Howeve r , ach iev ing sustained g row th w i l l i n v o l v e dea l ing w i t h the g r ow i n g debt bu rden 
o n an urgent basis. Jamaica has one o f the highest ra t ios o f to ta l debt t o GDP and 
domestic deb t t o GDP in the wo r ld . The analysis in the recent PER suggests that this 
l e v e l o f deb t i s o n l y sustainable i f the current very high p r im a r y surpluses (1 1 percent o f 
GDP) are sustained f o r l o n g periods. Even so, the debt dynamics r em a i n h i g h l y sensitive 
t o changes in g r ow t h and interest rates as w e l l as ex te rna l and domestic shocks (See 
Annex C o n D e b t Sustainability) 
27. 
I n la rge part due t o the high indebtedness, but also due t o past weak f isca l 
discipline, Gove rnmen t expenditure has become inc reas ing skewed t o recurrent spending. 
As a share o f to ta l expenditure, recurrent expenditure increased f r o m 77 percent in 
1992/93 t o 9 7 percent in 2003/04. Mo reove r , interest payments account f o r the single 
largest p o r t i o n o f the recurrent spending (49 percent in 2003/04). 
28. As a resu l t o f the large debt burden, and pa r t icu la r ly the la rge domestic debt, 
se rv ic ing the debt (interest and p r inc ipa l ) has taken an inc reas ing ly la rge r share o f the 
ove ra l l budget, thereby c r ow d i n g out p u b l i c sector investments and c r i t i c a l social sector 
and p rog ram spending. In addition, the c r e d i b i l i t y o f the budget and i t s use as an 

e f fec t ive t o o l o f f isca l p o l i c y has been comp rom ised by the ove ra rch ing short-term focus 
o n the management o f the la rge debt overhang. A l t h o u g h sus ta inab i l i ty o f the la rge 
p r ima ry surplus m a y b e p o l i t i c a l l y d i f f i c u l t , the Gove rnmen t does n o t consider the 
restructuring o f the debt a feasible op t ion g iven the cu r ren t structure o f the debt (Box 1).

v io len t c r im e in the wo r ld . Howeve r , i t i s the high murder rate (54 pe r 100,000 in 2004) 
that i s a t t rac t ing the most concerns in Jamaica. The C r im e Rate Ind ices (CR I ) show that 
f o r the past 3 0 years, v io len t crimes have increased steadily (1980, a v io len t e lec t ion year 
i s a clear outlier). Ove r the 1990s, the murder rate was la rge ly d r i v e n b y increasing 
leve ls o f d is t r ibu t ion and trans-shipment o f drugs, lead ing t o increased “gang wars”. T h e 
po l ice estimates that drug-related killings n ow account f o r mo re that 2 0 percent o f the 
murders annually. 
Increased drug t r a f f i c k i n g has l e d t o add i t iona l security measures o n 
the p o r t that increase the processing t ime f o r perishable products.

30. C r im e and violence are also concentrated in the ma jo r u rban centers, poss ib ly 
re f lec t ive o f the serious soc ia l p rob lems associated w i t h lack o f f am i l y t ies , g r ow i n g 
urbanization, high unemp loymen t as w e l l as drugs re la ted con f l ic ts . K i n g s t o n and St. 
And rew account f o r o n l y about 27 percent o f Jamaica’s to ta l popu la t ion but averaged 57 
percent o f to ta l murders between 1984 and 2001. C r im e and v io lence in Jamaica are also 
la rge ly concentrated amongst the poorest in society and amongst young males (14-24 
years) w h o o f ten tend t o b e the v i c t im s as w e l l as the perpetrators o f v io len t crime. In 
2003, males accounted f o r 98 percent o f those arrested f o r ma jo r c r imes and 49 percent 
were f r o m the 16-25 age group. A lso , 4 0 percent o f a l l ma jo r c r imes were c omm i t t e d 
against young persons. Y o u t h f r o m inne r c i t y areas are mo re l i k e l y t o be rec ru i ted as 
drug sellers because o f the i r re la t ive ly l ow e r oppo r tun i ty cost, g i v e n that they are mo re 
l i k e l y t o be ou t o f school and unemp loyed . 
31. Gender-based and domestic v io lence i s also g r ow i n g o f importance. 
In general, 
statistics ind ica te that reports o f v io len t c r imes against w om e n are o n the rise, though 
some o f this, m a y be due t o greater repo r t ing . T h e numbe r o f rapes and carnal abuses has 
increased over the last t w o years and accounts f o r ove r a quarter o f the ma jo r c r imes in 
2003. O f the crimes against youth, 65.7 percent o f the v i c t im s were females. Domes t ic 
violence also represents a s ign i f ican t p r o p o r t i o n o f the repo r ted murders. 
32. 
I t i s estimated that c r im e costs society at least 4 percent o f GDP annually, i n c l u d i n g 
los t production, hea l th expenses and p u b l i c and p r iva te spending f o r security. 

In 

12 

addition, expo r t ing firms’ security costs can be as h i g h as 5 percent o f sales. Sma l l firms’ 
losses due t o extortion, fraud, robbery and arson can b e 9 percent o f revenue, w i t h an 
average o f 3-6 percent f o r firms in manu fac tu r ing and d is t r ibu t ion (CEM , 2004). 
33. 
In the j o i n t coun t ry assistance strategy consultations (together w i t h DFID and IDB) 
w h i c h were h e l d across Jamaica, i t was po in ted ou t in several instances that c r ime and 
violence were con t r ibu t ing s ign i f ican t ly t o the number o f disabled, poo r persons some o f 
w h o m were transformed f r o m healthy, earning, independent persons. These accounts 
p rov ide anecdotal evidence that c r ime and violence con t r ibu te d i rec t ly and sometimes 
almost immed ia te ly t o personal poverty. 
34. Need to imp rove human development. Hea l th ind ica to rs f o r Jamaica compare 
w e l l w i t h other countries w i t h s im i la r o r even higher leve ls o f income; however, the 
e f f ic iency o f the p u b l i c hea l th system and equ i ty in access t o qua l i ty care are ongo ing 
problems. In addition, achievement o f the MDG goals w i t h respect t o reduc ing in fan t 
and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , im p r o v i n g maternal hea l th and comba t ing HIV/AIDS i s un l ike ly . 
Con t inu ing hea l th and n u t r i t i o n concerns inc lude the inc reas ing inc idence o f HIV/AIDS 
(an estimated 1.5 percent o f the adult popu la t ion affected). Other hea l th concerns inc lude 
a persistent pa t te rn o f l ow - b i r t h we igh t babies and con t inued pockets o f ma lnu t r i t ion . 
The incidence o f l ow - b i r t h we igh t babies, m a l n u t r i t i o n and preventable i l l n e s s and 
injuries impacts nega t ive ly o n human cap i ta l development. 
35. Ove r the past ten years, Jamaica has devoted an average o f 5.4 percent o f GDP t o 
education, a s ign i f ican t share o f pub l ic spending compared t o m idd le - income countries 
and others in the reg ion . As a result o f focused education p o l i c y and comm i tmen t o f 
fam i l ies t o education f o r the i r children, Jamaica has succeeded in ach iev ing over 95 
percent en ro l lmen t at the p re -p r ima ry l e v e l and un ive rsa l p r im a r y and l ow e r secondary 
education f o r b o t h girls and boys. Howeve r , access t o p re -p r ima ry and especially t o 
upper secondary education continues t o be l i n k e d t o income . In addition, a w o r r y i n g 
trend that m a y be l i n k e d t o the r ise in pove r ty in recent years i s the fac t that en ro l lmen t 
among a l l income groups dec l ined between 2000 and 2002. E n r o l lm e n t among 17 t o 18 
year olds i s also linked t o i n c om e and also dec l ined be tween 2000 and 2002 - f r o m 69 t o 
6 2 percent among students f r o m the wealthiest qu in t i le and f r o m 29 percent t o 19 percent 
among students f r o m the poorest qu in t i les . The poo r q u a l i t y o f education has meant that 
a large share o f students leave the f o rm a l education system w i t h o u t the requisite 
competencies f o r the w o r l d o f wo rk . Poo r educa t ion outcomes have s ign i f ican t 
imp l ica t ions f o r the labo r ma rke t and Jamaica’s ove ra l l competitiveness in a g loba l 
economy where the terms o f trade are t u r n i n g inc reas ing ly in favo r o f know ledge based 
industries. B o y s are pa r t icu la r ly at risk in the education system. Jamaica i s one o f the 
f ew countries in w h i c h there i s a reversal o f the n o rm a l gender d ispa r i ty in education as 
the ra t io o f girls t o boys in p r ima ry , secondary and te r t ia ry education reveals that girls 
have the advantage ove r b o y s f r o m grade 10 upwards. This gap w idens even fu r the r at 
the te r t ia ry leve l . 
36. Currently, the you th -a t - r isk p r o b l em i s one o f the mos t pressing concerns f o r 
Jamaica. The p r o b l em o f you th -a t - r isk i s a comp lex issue, caused by a mu l t i tude o f 
unde r ly ing factors that a f fec t Jamaican ch i ld ren and adolescents at various developmental 
stages, inc lud ing the p o o r q u a l i t y o f educa t ion and high rates o f a t t r i t ion f r o m school;

re la ted and domestic violence and sexual abuse. Children g r ow i n g up in poverty, l i v i n g 
in commun i t ies affected b y v io lence and unstable home environments are mos t “at risk. ” 
3 7 . H i g h r a t e s o f m i g r a t i o n o f sk i l led persons . As the 2004 C E M po in ted out, the 
rate o f em ig ra t ion o f the mo re h i g h l y educated wo rke rs i s high (over 20,000 per year in 
the 1990s) and this off-sets po ten t ia l imp rovemen t in the qua l i ty o f the labo r force. The 
la rge em ig ra t ion o f educated Jamaicans raises the issue o f the high cost o f education at 
the te r t ia ry leve l , a s ign i f ican t part o f w h i c h i s bo rne b y the State. 
38. D e c l i n e in compet it iveness . The m a i n challenge con f ron t ing p r iva te sector 
development i s t o accelerate g r ow t h b y im p r o v i n g Jamaica’s competitiveness. This 
dec l ined s ign i f ican t ly in the 1990s, reflected in dec l in ing shares o f exports in w o r l d trade 
and in Jamaica’s GDP and stagnation in expo r t earnings. Jamaica’s share o f w o r l d 
merchandise exports f e l l steadily f r o m 0.036 percent in 1994 t o 0.024 percent in 2001 
(CEM , 2004). This was accompanied b y an even larger p ropo r t iona te dec l ine in the share 
o f exports t o GDP, f r o m 32 percent t o 19 percent. This adverse performance has been 
c lose ly l i n k e d t o the appreciation o f the CPI-based rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate (REER) 
ove r 1992-98, and an even greater appreciation in the wage-based REER. The ve ry close 
link between Jamaica’s share in w o r l d merchandise exports and the REER i s also 
suggested b y the high co r re la t ion coe f f ic ien t o f -0.6. S im i la r ly , the share o f Jamaica’s 
goods and services exports in i t s GD P and the REER has a co r re la t ion coe f f ic ien t o f -0. 
8. The decline in Jamaica’s competitiveness i s also re la ted t o the poo r educational 
outcomes, l o w leve ls o f s k i l l s among those seeking emp loymen t and a high rate o f 
m ig ra t ion o f professionals and skilled persons as discussed above as w e l l as the c r ow d i n g 
ou t o f p r iva te inves tmen t by high pub l ic debt, rising c r im e and v io lence and reduced 
p u b l i c inves tmen t f o r basic infrastructure upkeep. In 2004, Jamaica was ranked 65 th 
among a to ta l o f 104 countries o n the G r ow t h Competitiveness Index (GCI)’, compared 
w i t h a rank ing o f 5 2 in 2001. O f the three ind ices that comp r ise the ove ra l l GC I , Jamaica 
ranked re la t ive ly high o n the Techno logy I n d e x (49) but m u c h l ow e r o n the Pub l ic 
I n s t i t u t i o n Index (69) and the Mac roeconom ic Env i ronmen t I n d e x (83). 
39. R e d u c t i o n in t r a d e preferences . The g loba l economy i s b e i n g t rans fo rmed i n t o an 
inc reas ing ly compe t i t ive and l ibe ra l ized t rad ing env i ronmen t associated w i th the erosion 
o f trade barriers and b i la te ra l trade preferences. 
Jamaica’s p re fe ren t ia l t rad ing 
arrangements f o r t w o o f i t s m a j o r expo r t crops, sugar and bananas, are l i k e l y t o be 
s ign i f ican t ly eroded ove r the nex t f ew years. 
In the p e r i o d o f adjustment, Jamaica i s 
l i k e l y t o face considerable soc ia l and econom ic challenges as these industries face an 
inc reas ing ly compe t i t ive ex te rna l env i ronmen t w h i c h m a y in some cases determine the 
ve ry su rv iva l o f these industries. 
I n 2003, expo r ts o f sugar and bananas together 
accounted f o r about 12.4 percent o f t rad i t iona l expo r ts w h i c h inc lude baux i te and 
a lum ina exports. Howeve r , w h e n baux i te and a lum ina are excluded, sugar and bananas 
account f o r mo re than h a l f o f t rad i t iona l exports. 
In 2003, about 17.6 percent o f the 
emp loyed labor fo rce was in agriculture, the bulk o f w h i c h i s be l ieved t o be in the sugar 
and banana sectors.

open economy in the Caribbean, Jamaica i s p rone t o b o t h economic shocks as w e l l as 
na tu ra l disasters that cou ld have severe negative impac t o n the economy and o n

w e l l as the impac t o f Hu r r icane I v a n (w i t h damage estimated at 8 percent o f GDP) are 
po ignan t reminders o f Jamaica’s con t inu ing vu lne rab i l i ty . H o w t o m i t iga te and respond 
t o these events in the context o f tight f isca l constraints are ongo ing challenges that the 
government faces. 

111. The Government’s Medium-Term Policy Framework and Priorities for Growth 
and Poverty Reduction 

41. T o address the ongo ing and emerging challenges, the Government o f Jamaica has 
a r t icu la ted a Medium-Term Socio-Economic P o l i c y F ramewo rk (MTSEPF ) cove r ing the 
p e r i o d April 2004 t o M a r c h 2009. This p o l i c y f ramewo rk , w h i c h resulted f r o m w ide 
p u b l i c consultations and enjoys strong dono r support, builds o n the overarching 
f ramewo rk established in the 1996 N a t i o n a l Indus t r ia l P o l i c y (NIP), the ob jec t ive o f 
w h i c h was t o p r o v i d e a systematic, ho l is t ic and comprehensive approach t o the

Medium Term Economic Framework 

43. U n d e r i t s M e d i um - T e rm Econom ic F ramewo rk , the government proposes a m i x o f

im p r o v e d g row th . At the request o f the authorities, the IMF i s p r o v i d i n g in tens i f ied 
surveillance o f the i r med ium - te rm mac roeconom ic p rog ram . This economic f ramewo rk 
targets rea l GDP g r ow t h o f about 3-3.5 percent during 2005/06 and 2008/09 w i t h 
i n f l a t i o n dec l in ing t o 5 -6 percent by 2008/09. 
Im p o r t requirements o f several ma jo r 
cap i ta l projects t o be undertaken b y the p r iva te sector in mining, tourism, cement and 
other areas m a y cause the ex te rna l current account de f ic i t t o w i d e n tempo ra r i ly in the 
c om i n g t w o years ( to about 13 percent o f GDP in 2006/07). Ove r the med ium - te rm , a 
two - th i rds increase i n a lum ina p roduc t ion capacity and almost doub l ing in the number o f 
ho te l rooms are expected t o raise mining expo r ts and t rave l receipts. This, together w i t h 
h ighe r remittances and a gradual dec l ine in o i l prices, shou ld he lp reduce the current 
account de f ic i t t o about 4 percent o f GDP by 2008/09. The f isca l p rog ram targets a 
smaller f isca l d e f i c i t o f 4-5 percent o f GDP in 2004/05 f o l l ow e d b y a balanced budget in 
2005/06 and sma l l surpluses in 2006/07 t o 2008/09 (Tab le 4). The monetary and 
exchange rate po l ic ies are a imed at the maintenance o f a stable, predictable mac ro 
environment. M o r e spec i f ica l ly , the ob jec t ive i s f o r domestic i n f l a t i o n rates t o g radua l ly 
converge t o those o f Jamaica’s m a j o r t rad ing partners.

In the f isca l area, the government i s considering the recommendations o f a tax

P u b l i c satisfaction w i t h government po l ic ies and the government’s a b i l i t y t o carry ou t i t s

business environment i s affected by co r rup t ion , and ve ry poo r r u l e o f l a w and c r ime 
negates the pos i t ive elements in the business env i ronmen t (CEM , 2004). G o o d 
governance i s fundamental t o the strategic objectives o f the Government. In im p r o v i n g 
governance, the Gove rnmen t proposes t o focus o n t w o central themes: (i) enhanced

Jamaica’s na tu ra l resources p l a y a cen t ra l r o l e in i t s development. 
T h e k e y 
economic sectors o f agriculture, t o u r i sm and baux i te mining are a l l na tu ra l resource

Coun t ry Assistance N o t e (CAN) o f December 1998. 
In sum, the C A N no ted that 
adjustment programs did no t ensure adequate f isca l adjustment and instead the 
Gove rnmen t r e l i e d o n external bo r row ing , w h i c h resulted in an increase in Jamaica’s 
external debt and the Bank ’s exposure. O n investment lending, the C A N no ted that the 
amb i t ious design o f projects was no t consistent w i t h l o c a l imp lemen ta t ion capacity, and 
insu f f ic ien t attention t o funding r i s k s and p ro jec t management were the lead ing causes o f

77. The comprehensive M e d i um -T e rm Soc io -Econom ic Po l icy F ramewo rk ou t l ined b y 
the Gove rnmen t provides a good basis f o r the B a n k G roup ’s continued support in concert 
w i th other donors. The W o r l d B a n k G roup strategy f o r FY06-09

w i t h the government’s M e d i um -T e rm Soc io -Econom ic P o l i c y F ramewo rk and i s based 
o n three m u t u a l l y re in fo rc ing pillars and supported b y t w o cross-cutting themes o f 
Governance and Env i ronmen ta l sustainability. 
The three p r im a r y pillars are: (i) 
accelerating 
inc lus ive economic g row th ; (ii) im p r o v i n g human development and 
oppo r tun i ty ; and (iii) c r ime p reven t ion and reduc t ion . 

The World Bank Group Lending Program 

Pillar 1: Accelerating inclusive economic growth 

78. The 2000 C A S and subsequent C A S Progress Repo r t focused o n res to r ing

MTSEPF. The recen t ly comp le ted P u b l i c Expend i tu re Rev iew (PER) also i d e n t i f i e d 
specific issues w h i c h the government needs t o address f o r better a l ignmen t o f the budget

B a n k w i l l w o r k w i t h the government f o r a w i d e dissemination o f the PER across 
m in is t r ies and departments. 
81. Continuing public sector reform. With support f r o m the B a n k under the P u b l i c 
Sector Mode rn iza t ion P ro jec t (PSMP), the gove rnmen t has comp le ted a f i r s t phase o f

In this regard, the B a n k i s

Im p r o v i n g in f r a s t ru c tu r e . The government has made considerable progress in 
encouraging p r iva te pa r t ic ipa t ion 
in the p r o v i s i o n o f

In order t o support p r iva te sector-led g r ow t h in 
Jamaica, during the C A S p e r i o d the I F C and MIGA w i l l con t inue t o support projects in 
infrastructure (ports, power, wastewater treatment, transportation, etc. ) and the f inanc ia l

seek oppo r tun i t ies t o support the expansion o f : (i) baux i te and a lum ina p roduc t ion ; (ii) 
services i n c l u d i n g strong l o c a l and /or reg iona l h o t e l owners/operators; and (iii) strong 
companies wishing t o modernize and expand domes t ica l ly and reg iona l ly . In addition, 
I F C w i l l seek t o p rov ide advisory services t o increase the r o l e o f the p r iva te sector in the 
de l ive ry o f goods and services t o the population. Based o n the findings o f the FSAP (see

o n a selective basis, in order t o he lp create an enab l ing env i ronmen t and foster supply. 
Ru r a l development 

87. Jamaica’s r u r a l p o l i c y v is ion i s that o f an econom ica l ly v iab le and soc ia l ly dynam ic 
r u r a l env i ronmen t where there i s un ive rsa l access t o social amenities, active pa r t ic ipa t ion 
o f l o c a l commun i t ies in dec is ion -mak ing and where oppo r tun i t ies f o r g r ow t h are created 
w h i l e ensu r ing sustainable use o f na tu ra l resources. The p o l i c y has f i v e p r i n c i p a l goals: 
(i) p r om o t i n g g r ow t h w h i l e p ro tec t ing the env i ronmen t ; (ii) p r o v i d i n g basic services and

development; ( iv ) suppo r t ing the development o f human and social capital; and (v) 
eradicating pove r ty and p r om o t i n g social inc lus ion . 
88. The Government’s r u r a l g row th strategy focuses o n inc reas ing access t o basic 
services, income generating ac t iv i t ies outside the ag r icu l tu ra l sector and creating an 
enab l ing env i ronmen t th rough in f ras t ruc tu re development. This can be done b y 
im p r o v i n g r u r a l roads and i r r i g a t i o n infrastructure, storage, b roke r ing comme rc ia l 
partnerships between merchants, ho te l chains o r agro-processors and fa rme r associations, 
contract f a rm i n g and other contractual re la t ionsh ips that add r u r a l value and increase 
competitiveness. C rea t ing linkages be tween the t o u r i sm sector and r u r a l areas i s an 
impo r tan t aspect o f rural development that has n o t been fu l ly exploited. F o r example,

t rad i t iona l f o o d p repa ra t ion f o r hotels in r u r a l areas, heritage tours and p lan ta t ion visits. 
89 . Such in i t ia t ives c o u l d b e f inanced th rough c omm u n i t y d r i v e n investments in co - 
operation w i t h tou r operators and ho te l chains. 
In co l labo ra t ion w i t h other donors

( inc lud ing 
the c omm u n i t y p ro jec ts such as small-scale

The ongo ing Pove r ty

Pillar 2: Improving human development and opportunity 

Transformation of education 

90. Early Childhood Development. The Gove rnmen t i s aggressively p r om o t i n g ea r ly 
ch i ldhood education as pa r t o f i t s strategy t o imp rove education outcomes. This i s in 
recogn i t ion o f the fact that w i thou t ea r ly learning, later education i s mo re cos t ly and less 
e f fec t ive . Experience f r o m other countries suggests that ea r ly ch i ldhood in te rven t ions 
( inc lud ing ea r ly ch i ldhood care and educa t ion programs) can im p r o v e education 
outcomes and help break the intergenerational transmission o f poverty. E a r l y ch i ldhood 
in te rven t ions can also h e l p t o accelerate inc lus ive economic g r ow t h and p romo te c r ime 
p reven t ion and reduction. The focus o n ea r ly ch i ldhood education, therefore, tackles one 
o f the ve ry impo r tan t dimensions o f the you th -a t - r isk p rob lem and complements ongo ing 
B a n k support f o r the R e f o rm o f Secondary Educa t ion and the Soc ia l Safety N e t Re fo rm . 
91. The B a n k w o u l d support the Government’s e f fo r ts in strengthening ea r ly ch i ldhood 
development th rough an Early C h i l d h o o d Deve lopmen t P ro jec t (US$15 m i l l i o n ) . This 
operation w o u l d finance and evaluate innova t ive in i t ia t ives f o r ch i ld ren in the birth t o age 
3 cohort, inc lud ing , in te r alia, pa ren t ing programs, outreach programs f o r pa r t icu la r ly at 
risk young ch i ld ren ( inc lud ing l o w birth we igh t and ma lnou r ished babies and babies at

in i t ia t ives w o u l d build o n lessons learned f r o m in te rna t iona l experience and o n the

coho r t and strategies t o increase p re -p r ima ry en ro lmen t among ch i ld ren w h o are poo r . 

92. Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) in Education. The government has comm i t ted t o 

imp lemen t ing a SW A P in education t o support the structural re fo rms t o im p r o v e the 
education system. 
I t i s expected that the imp lemen ta t ion o f the SW A P c o u l d take 
upwards o f eighteen mon ths as the gove rnmen t moves t o im p r o v e i t s f iduc ia ry systems 
th rough the imp lemen ta t ion o f an ac t ion p l a n developed th rough an ongo ing j o i n t W o r l d

strengthening o f Jamaica’s mu l t i -sec to ra l capacity t o respond t o the epidemic. 

Pillar 3: C r i m e p r e v e n t i o n and r e d u c t i o n 

94 . The Bank ’s research o n c r ime and violence in Jamaica suggests that i t i s 
concentrated in the inne r c i t y communities and amongst youth. The Bank ’s strategy, 
therefore, focuses o n these tw o en t ry po in ts through the Inne r C i t y Bas ic Services f o r the 
Poor p ro jec t and the Y o u t h at Risk Project. 

95 . 

I n n e r C i t y Bas ic Serv ices f o r the Poo r . Jamaica’s i n n e r - c i t y commun i t ies have 

become a flashpoint 
f o r the coun t ry ’s bu rgeon ing c r ime and v io lence problem. A 
comp lex re la t ionsh ip has evo lved in recent years between o rgan ized c r im i n a l agents and 
inne r -c i ty communities. C r im e and violence - coup led w i th g r ow i n g pove r ty and 
unemp loymen t - have fu r the r exacerbated social f ragmen ta t ion and the weakness o f c i v i c 
organization in inne r -c i ty comm.unities. A 1997 W o r l d B a n k study o f U r b a n Pove r ty and 
V io lence concluded that v io lence in poo r u rban commun i t ies erodes the t w o k e y assets

T h e repo r t recommended 
in te rven t ions that integrate the de l ive ry o f services w i t h building o f c i v i c institutions. 
The 2004 W o r l d B a n k CEM also highlighted the negative im p a c t o f c r ime and violence

Government’s M e d i um - T e rm Soc io -Econom ic P o l i c y F ramewo rk (MTSEPF) l i s t s inne r - 
c i t y renewa l as a p r i o r i t y . 
96 . The qua l i ty and coverage o f basic services in inne r -c i ty commun i t ies a re poo r w i t h 
pockets o f extreme dep r iva t ion in pa r t icu la r neighborhoods. Access t o water, sanitary 
facilities, transport, health, p u b l i c areas and social and sport fac i l i t ies i s also inadequate 
for a m a j o r i t y o f inne r -c i ty neighborhoods. Th rough the I n n e r C i t y Bas ic Services

co l labo ra t ion w i t h other donors w h o are i n v o l v e d in comp lemen ta ry operations inc lud ing 
USAID, DFID, IDB, EU and C I D A . 
97 . Y o u t h A t Risk. As the 2004 CEM po in ted out, y o u n g males in the age group 14- 
24 account f o r the bulk o f c r im e and violence. Add ress ing the y o u t h at risk p rob lem i s ,

112. Since September 2002, Jamaica has been one o f the coun t ry p i l o t s f o r 
ha rmon iza t ion . Progress has been made in the fou r core areas in w h i c h the e f fo r ts in 
Jamaica have been directed: (i) f inanc ia l management, (ii) procurement, (iii) 
env i ronmen ta l safeguards, and ( iv ) ana ly t ica l w o r k and strategy. O n f inanc ia l 
management, the Government has accepted the in te rna t iona l standard o n f inanc ia l 
management and auditing. As a f i rs t step, the government i s m o v i n g i t s accounting f r o m 
a cash basis to an accrual basis and i s already p i l o t i n g this in three m in is t r ies and 
departments. The audit system has been strengthened and deepened and a f inanc ia l 
management i n f o rm a t i o n system has been developed. The Gove rnmen t also intends t o 
in t roduce a common f ramewo rk f o r the presentation o f f inanc ia l reports so that one repo r t 
c o u l d su f f ice f o r a l l donors pa r t ic ipa t ing in the same p ro jec t . 
113. In la te 2003, the W o r l d B a n k unde r took a Coun t ry Procurement Assessment 
R e v i ew (CPAR ) w o r k i n g w i t h the Procurement P o l i c y Imp lemen ta t ion Unit o f the 
Ministry o f Finance and P lann ing (MOFP ) . F o l l o w i n g o n the recommendations o f the

reg ime shou ld await agreements reached unde r the FTAA procurement regime. 
1 14. O n env i ronmen ta l assessment and social safeguards, the p r e l im i n a r y analysis 
suggests that ha rmon iza t ion i s possible g iven the re la t ive s im i l a r i t y between the 
env i ronmen ta l assessment system that the Gove rnmen t has put in place and that o f m a n y

115. While Jamaica has made some progress o n i t s f inanc ia l management, procurement 
and env i ronmen ta l safeguards systems, there i s fu r the r w o r k t o be done in a l l three areas 
in order t o move t o the use o f coun t ry systems. 
Jamaica’s capac i ty t o ca r ry the

techn ica l assistance t o build capacity w i t h i n the ha rmon iza t ion secretariat at the P lann ing 
Ins t i tu te o f Jamaica. The j o i n t B a nW ID B CFA, w h i c h i s underway, has already p rov ided 
some know ledge support f o r the A u d i t o r General’s O f f i c e and i s expected t o make a

Bank Exposure in Jamaica 

119. B a n k exposure t o Jamaica has dec l ined in recent years as a resu l t of l ow e r lending, 
in l i n e w i t h the ove ra l l reduc t ion in ODA f lows . At end-January 2005, Jamaica’s debt t o 
the B a n k was US$435 m i l l i o n , o r about one third o f the mu l t i la te ra l debt and 8 percent o f 
the to ta l external debt. The re i s also about U S $ 9 0 m i l l i o n o f undisbursed comm i tmen ts 
o n fou r ongo ing projects. Excep t f o r the three year p e r i o d be tween 2001 and 2003, n e t 
f l ow s to Jamaica during the pe r iod 1990 t o 2004 have been negative. N e t f l ow s were 
negative US$36 m i l l i o n in FY04.

120. The current lending p rog ram f o r Jamaica i s ca re fu l ly designed t o support Jamaica’s 
k e y development p r io r i t ies w i t h i n the con tex t o f the country’s ove ra l l debt containment 
strategy and also m i n im i z i n g the exposure risk f o r the Bank . Unde r the base-case lend ing 
scenario, a ve ry modest lending range o f US$15 m i l l i o n t o US$25 m i l l i o n per year i s 
planned. Unde r this scenario, Jamaica’s outstanding and disbursed debt t o the B a n k 
w o u l d continue to decline t o about US$368 m i l l i o n (about 6 percent o f the to ta l external 
deb t stock) at end 2007. With the DPL o f US$75 m i l l i o n , the outstanding and disbursed 
debt t o the B a n k w o u l d increase t o US$424 m i l l i o n (6.5 percent o f the to ta l external debt 
stock) in 2008 before f a l l i n g t o US$404 m i l l i o n (5.7 percent o f the to ta l external debt 
stock) in 2009. 
121. With the proposed modest base-case lending, i t i s anticipated that IBRD exposure 
w o u l d o n l y increase ma rg ina l ly as suggested by the p ro jec ted ind ica to rs in Tab le 11 
b e l ow . D e b t service t o IBRD as a share o f exports o f goods and services i s p ro jec ted t o 
rema in at 1.1 percent between 2005 and 2006 and then f a l l t o 1 .O percent thereafter. Debt 
service t o IBRD as a p ropo r t ion o f to ta l external debt service i s expected t o r ise f r o m 5 
percent in 2005 to 6.2 percent in 2006, f a l l i n g back t o 5 percent in 2007 before rising t o 
7 .1 percent in 2009 (assuming the p roposed disbursement o f the US$75 m i l l i o n DPL in 
2008).

K e y Risks and Risk Mitigation 

122. K e y risks f o r the p lanned p r o g r am are the coun t ry ’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o na tu ra l 
disasters and t o ex tema l economic shocks, domestic shocks, p o l i c y slippage o r reversal, 
no tab ly in the wake o f the 2007 elections, and poss ib le popu la t ion ’s fatigue w i t h the 
s ign i f ican t and sustained high l e v e l o f f i s c a l adjustment requ i red b y the high debt burden. 
T h e l im i t e d f isca l space resu l t ing f r o m the la rge debt overhang i s also a risk f o r the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f this CAS. T h e CAS p rog ram tries t o manage these r i s k s th rough 
ca re fu l selection o f triggers and m o n i t o r i n g o f progress, con t inued support f o r disaster

in the coun t ry , and linking fast disbursing lend ing t o p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion progress and 
results. 
123. N a tu r a l disasters. Jamaica i s h i g h l y vulnerable t o na tu ra l disasters i n c l u d i n g 
hurricanes, earthquakes and f lood ing . 
These events, either occu r r ing together o r 
separately, can have s ign i f ican t adverse impac t o n the social and economic l i f e o f the 
country. F r o m recent experiences, hurricane and/or f l o o d i n g can have s ign i f ican t impac t 
o n GDP g r ow t h and o n domestic i n f l a t i o n as w e l l as necessitate m a j o r adjustment in 
f isca l expenditure due t o re-construction needs. T o m i t iga te the impac t o f na tu ra l 
disasters, the B a n k has assisted the Government w i t h hazard mapp ing as w e l l as w i t h 
r e f o rm i n g i t s Soc ia l Safety N e t p rog ram and th rough commun i ty support th rough the 
Jamaica Soc ia l Investment Fund (JSIF). I n addition, recent ana ly t ica l w o r k (PER) has 
suggested that the Government shou ld consider the establishment o f a “protected” 
contingency fund t o be activated in the event o f a na tu ra l disaster. The Gove rnmen t o f 
Jamaica has also expressed a des i re t o pa r t ic ipa te in a possible reg iona l risk p o o l i n g 
arrangement f o r catastrophe risk insurance. A High L e v e l C A R I C O M Heads o f 
Government M e e t i n g in September 2004 f o rm a l l y requested that the B a n k undertake a 
feas ib i l i ty f o r such an i n i t i a t i v e and this w o r k i s n ow ongoing. 
124. Ex te rna l Economic shocks. Jamaica i s p rone t o ex te rna l shocks arising f r o m o i l 
p r ice increases, interest rates increases o r indeed any shock t o the N o r t h Ame r ican 
economy that results in a s ign i f ican t sho r t fa l l in tou r is t arrivals. Such shocks m a y resu l t 
in a deterioration o f the balance o f payments and/or the f isca l account and consequently 
the debt dynamics. As po in ted ou t in the recent C E M and PER, the high l e v e l o f debt and 
the primary f isca l surplus requ i red t o service the debt have increased Jamaica’s 
vu lne rab i l i ty t o shocks. F o r example, Jamaica c o u l d be hard hit i f a turning p o i n t occurs 
in eme rg ing market bonds, d r iven f o r example b y h ighe r U S interest rates. Jamaica’s o i l - 
dependence and i t s already high and increasing rate o f ene rgy - in tens i ty make the coun t ry 
pa r t icu la r ly p rone t o o i l p r i c e shocks. Jamaica i s cu r ren t ly deve lop ing an energy strategy 
and a rev iew o f the B a n k supported Demand S ide Management i s cu r ren t ly unde rway 
and should p rov ide some use fu l lessons o n energy e f f ic iency . In the event o f an interest 
rate shock, the gove rnmen t may need t o increase the l e v e l o f p r im a r y surplus even 
further. The current l e v e l o f n e t in te rna t iona l reserves (app rox ima te ly US$1.8 b i l l i o n o r 
4.5 months o f impo r ts ) w o u l d also p rov ide some cush ion f o r an ex te rna l shock. 
Howeve r , in the event o f a s ign i f ican t shock, the Gove rnmen t m a y have t o request 
support f r o m the IMF and donors. 
125. Domestic shocks. Though infrequent, Jamaica i s subject t o domestic shocks f r o m 
r io ts related t o l a c k o f water, p o l i c e killings o r gas p r ice increases. Such events can have 
a negative impac t o n econom ic performance. W h i l e i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o m i t iga te these kinds 
o f shocks, the proposed inne r -c i ty basic services p ro jec t and the na t iona l c omm u n i t y 
development p ro jec t are t w o strategic in te rven t ions w h i c h in tandem w i th the other social 
capital building ac t iv i t ies f r o m other donors can h e l p t o ease soc ia l tensions. 
126. Policy slippage/slow implementation. The Gove rnmen t has demonstrated strong 
comm i tmen t t o reduc ing f isca l and debt imbalances as ind ica ted by sustaining p r im a r y 
f isca l balances in excess o f 7 percent o f GDP fo r the last 5 years. This comm i tmen t was 
recently rea f f i rmed w i t h the maintenance o f the expend i tu re p r o g r am in spite o f the 
impac t o f the recent Hu r r icane Ivan . Howeve r , w i th general e lec t ions due by 2007 and 

41 

the M O U signed w i t h the pub l ic sector unions e x p i r i n g in M a r c h 2006, there are strong 
r i s k s o f p o l i c y slippage after M a r c h 2006. First, the pub l ic sector un ions m a y use the 
oppo r tun i ty created b y a closely contested e lec t ion t o pressure the Government f o r catch- 
up wages. Second, e lec t ion induced spending in the year p r i o r t o and during the elections 
m a y wo rsen the f isca l balance and exacerbate the debt s i tua t ion as was the case f o r the 
2002 elections. The general population’s fatigue w i t h the s ign i f ican t and sustained high 
l e v e l o f f i s c a l adjustment may also result in p o l i c y slippages p r i o r t o the elections. 
A t temp ts w i l l be made t o m i t iga te such r i s k s b y ma in ta in ing a close dialogue w i t h the 
Government, the oppos i t ion and c i v i l society t o ensure con t inued broad-based ownership 
of the p rog ram . Second, the high-case lend ing p r o g r am w i l l o n l y be t r igge red b y an 18- 
m o n t h t rack reco rd o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance, and w i t h ca re fu l 
a t ten t ion p a i d to i t s timing vis-&vis the fo r thcom ing elections. Third, the results-based 
m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rk w i t h broad-based support f r o m the donors w i l l act as a ve ry 
p ow e r f u l check against p o l i c y slippage/reversal o r a s lowdown in the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the p rog ram . 
127. Limited Fiscal Space. The investment l e n d i n g support detailed in this C A S i s 
based o n the assumption that there w i l l be adequate f isca l space t o p rov ide fo r : (a) vo t ing 
o f the adequate amount o f resources in the na t iona l budget; and (b) the t im e l y 
disbursement o f f inanc ia l resources f r o m the Conso l ida ted Fund t o p r o v i d e f o r the 
e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion o f the projects t o meet the i r development objectives. Howeve r , 
a de te r io ra t ion o f the debt dynamics requiring m o r e resources f o r interest payments c o u l d 
comp rom ise the ava i lab i l i ty o f domestic f inanc ing f o r the p r i o r i t y projects. T o he lp 
m i t iga te this risk, the imp lemen ta t ion o f the p ro jec ts has been phased and the size o f the 
projects have been k e p t deliberately small.

Debt Sustainability 

As has been po in ted ou t i n the recent C o u n t r y Econom ic Memo randum (CEM) and 
P u b l i c Expend i tu re Rev iew (PER), the size o f the p u b l i c debt i s perhaps the biggest 
economic challenge wh ich the Government faces in the m e d i um t o l o n g term. Even under 
the mos t op t im is t ic scenario, the debt declines o n l y s l ow l y and the debt dynam ic i s 
subject t o probable shocks that c o u l d impac t k e y de te rm in ing parameters i n c l u d i n g 
g row th , in f la t ion , exchange rate and interest rates. 

T h e Jamaican authorities have articulated a debt management strategy w h i c h aims t o 
reduce the debt to sustainable levels, and ensure that b o r r ow i n g costs and r i s k s are 
m in im ized . M o r e specifically, the strategy invo lves : (a) ma in ta in ing a prudent debt 
structure; (b) using market mechanisms f o r domestic debt issuance; (c) p romo t ing and 
building a liquid and e f f ic ien t ma rke t f o r gove rnmen t securities; (d) increasing the 
transparency and p red ic tab i l i ty o f p r im a r y ma rke t debt issuance; (e) f inanc ing the f isca l 
d e f i c i t and debt redemption; and (0 accessing the ex te rna l ma rke t f o r funds t o the extent 
o f gross external amortization. Based o n this strategy o f t igh te r f isca l p o l i c y and faster 
n om i n a l G D P g row th , the authorities expect the p u b l i c deb t -GDP ra t io t o decline t o 136.6 
percent o f GDP b y the end o f FY2004/05 and then fu r the r t o about 100 percent o f GDP 
in 2008/09. 
Tab le C1 be low , iden t i f ies the l e v e l o f f isca l effort-in 
terms o f the p r ima ry balance- 
that w o u l d b e required t o stabilize the stock o f debt over t im e g iven the c r i t i c a l 
parameters o f g row th , interest rates and i n f l a t i o n . F o r example, assuming a g r ow t h rate o f 
2 percent, an interest rate o f 14 percent and an i n f l a t i o n rate o f 6 percent, a p r im a r y 
surplus o f 8.1 percent w o u l d be requ i red t o keep the debt stable. Under the same 
assumptions, a m u c h stronger f isca l e f fo r t (a h i g h e r p r im a r y surplus) w o u l d b e requ i red 
t o even tua l ly reduce the deb t -GDP ra t io t o the targeted l e v e l o f 100 percent o f GDP. With 
the deb t -GDP reduced t o 100 percent, unde r the same assumptions, the government w i l l 
o n l y need a p r im a r y surplus o f 5.4 percent t o s tab i l ize the debt.
