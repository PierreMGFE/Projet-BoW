. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Coun t ry Context 

i. 

L a o P D R has undertaken s ign i f ican t reforms to move f r om a command t o a market economy 
and these re forms have helped stimulate g row th and reduce pover ty . G row th has averaged 6 percent 
per year between 1991 and 2003 and the inc idence o f pover ty has fa l len f r om 46 percent in 1992 to 
33 percent in 2003. The s tab i l iza t ion program introduced in the late 1990s has also reduced in f la t ion 
to single d ig i ts . However , the Government’s f isca l pos i t ion has continued to rema in frag i le and the 
med ium- term debt service i s on ly manageable prov ided economic re forms are maintained. 

ii. Sustaining g row th and ensuring that the various sectors can accelerate p roduc t iv i ty and 
benefit f r om linkages t o dynamic reg iona l markets w i l l require fur ther l ibe ra l iza t ion o f the trade 
regime, improvements in other aspects o f the business environment, improvements in infrastructure, 
and better management o f forestry, hydro, and mining resources. Sustaining g row th w i l l also require 
s ign i f ican t governance reforms. L a o PDR governance indicators stand be low reg iona l and g loba l 
averages; and wh i le some progress has been made in imp rov ing pub l ic expenditure management, 
ove ra l l pub l ic adm in is tra t ion r e f o rm has proved much more d i f f i c u l t to imp lemen t than the first 
wave o f economic reforms. Capacity constraints also continue to be a s ign i f ican t challenge. 

iii. L a o PDR i s o n track to m e e t the poverty M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goa l (MDG) b y 2015, 
but w i l l have d i f f i c u l t y in ach iev ing many o f the other MDGs. Soc ia l ind ica tors fo r health and 
education, maternal and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , and access to an improved water source are par t icu lar ly l ow . 
The safety ne t system in L a o PDR i s underdeveloped and vulnerable groups, such as up land 
communities and ethnic m inor i t ies , are especially susceptible. Bo ld , innova t ive steps w i l l have to be 
taken to t ru ly imp rove social outcomes and reduce vu lnerab i l i ty , inc lud ing imp rov ing the access, 
targeting and e f f ic iency o f service de l ivery , developing adequate pay and employment po l ic ies in the 
social sectors, exp lo r ing alternative options fo r service de l ivery t o remote communities, and tak ing 
an integrated approach to imp rov ing up land ru ra l l ive l ihoods . 

The Na t iona l G r ow t h and Poverty E rad ica t ion Strategy 

i v . 
In i t s Na t iona l G row th and Pover ty Erad ica t ion Strategy (NGPES-2004), the Government 
proposes to raise annual g row th t o 6-7 percent and to eradicate mass pover ty b y 2010. Developed 
w i t h an unprecedented leve l o f consu l ta t ion and participation, the NGPES stresses the Government’s 
comm i tmen t to sound macroeconomic po l ic ies to sustain growth, and prudent monetary and f isca l 
po l ic ies combined w i t h structural re forms . T o convert sustained g row th in to improved social 
outcomes, the NGPES also recognizes that strengthened pub l ic sector management and capacity 
development w i l l be cr i t ica l , as w i l l better service delivery, and better management o f na tura l 
resources and the environment. 

Reca l ibrated W o r l d B a n k Assistance Strategy 

v. 
D ia logue and engagement between L a o PDR and the W o r l d Bank have strengthened since 
the last Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS), catalyzed b y the NGPES, the N a m Theun 2 hydropower 
pro jec t and government interest in reg iona l integration. The present C A S has been designed to 
support the NGPES and w i t h i n this framework, key drivers o f fu ture g row th as w e l l as better 
targeting o f social outcomes and reductions in vu lnerab i l i ty . The W o r l d Bank ’s ana ly t ica l and 
advisory activities (AAA) p rog ram and Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Cred i t (PRSC) framework w i l l 
prov ide strategic support fo r strengthening the dialogue on the r e f o rm agenda. The W o r l d Bank has 
recalibrated i t s approach fo r this new CAS , incorpora t ing a stronger emphasis on bu i ld ing capacity. 
W o r l d Bank assistance w i l l focus w i t h i n each C A S ob jec t ive on suppor t ing iden t i f ica t ion , 

p r io r i t iza t ion , and remova l o f key capacity constraints to achieving pover ty reduc t ion and economic 
and soc ia l development goals. The CAS also incorporates a stronger emphasis on partnerships, 
inc lud ing deve lop ing a consensus among donors and the Government on c r i t ica l r e f o rm issues and 
h ow best to address them. 

C A S Ob j e c t i v e s and Outcomes 

0 

v i . 
W o r l d B a n k assistance w i l l support the imp lemen ta t ion o f the NGPES in tw o substantive 
p r i o r i t y areas: 
C A S O b j e c t i v e 1: Sustain g row th through imp roved management o f key drivers-regional 
in tegra t ion and pr iva te sector development, 
ru ra l development, and na tura l resource 
management. 
E xp e c t ed Outcomes: Strengthened reg iona l in tegra t ion and pr iva te sector development 
strengthened 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
to support 
ru ra l development and agr icu l tura l 
p roduc t iv i ty ; and improved po l ic ies and ins t i tu t iona l capacities to support more sustainable 
and par t ic ipa tory management and conservation o f na tura l resources. 

0 C A S Ob j e c t i v e 2: Imp rove social outcomes and reduce vu lnerab i l i ty through strengthened 
pub l ic f inanc ia l management and service de l ive ry capacities and targeted pover ty reduc t ion 
programs. 
E xp e c t ed Outcomes: Strengthened pub l ic f inanc ia l management capacities; imp roved 
access to and qua l i ty o f basic hea l th and education services, w i t h an emphasis on vulnerable 
groups; and imp roved approaches to reduc ing pover ty o f the most vulnerable. 
These objectives are complemented b y tw o add i t iona l CAS objectives that capture key elements o f 
the approach that the W o r l d Bank w i l l use to support these substantive pr ior i t ies : 
0 C A S Ob j e c t i v e 3: Adop t a strategic approach to capacity development and partnerships in 
support o f better NGPES results. 
E xp e c t ed Outcomes: Strengthened capacities o f the Committee 
fo r P lann ing and 
Investment, the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, and l i n e m i n i s t r i e s to plan, coordinate, and mon i to r 
NGPES implementation; strengthened key sectoral and p rov inc ia l capacities in support o f 
CAS objectives; strengthened capacities o f loca l partner ins t i tu t ions t o support capacity 
development activities; and strengthened donor partnerships fo r better r e s u l t s . 
C A S Ob j e c t i v e 4: Support imp lemen ta t ion o f N a m Theun 2 (NT2 ) as an example o f an area- 
based, sustainable na tura l resource development p rog ram that contributes t o growth, social 
outcomes, capacity development, and stronger partnerships. 
E xp e c t ed Outcomes: Sustained economic growth, inc lud ing greater reg iona l in tegra t ion and 
more sustainable na tura l resource management; N T 2 mechanisms are put in place t o ensure 
that expected revenues con tr ibu te to increases in spending o n p r io r i ty pover ty reduc t ion and 
env ironmen ta l pro tec t ion programs, and u l t ima te ly t o strengthened service de l ivery and 
improved soc ia l outcomes; N T 2 contributes to imp roved management capacity, coord ina t ion 
and par t ic ipa t ion , and mon i tor ing ; and NT2 invo lves con t inued and regular consu l ta t ion w i t h 
loca l communities as w e l l as e f fec t ive partnerships among a l l concerned stakeholders.

v i i . 
The W o r l d Bank w i l l take an integrated approach t o the CAS b y comb in ing various 
instruments, w i t h a par t icu lar emphasis o n strategic and par t ic ipa tory AAA. A series o f PRSCs w i l l 
support c r i t ica l pub l ic sector re forms to strengthen accoun tab i l i ty and e f f ic iency o f pub l ic 
expenditure management, and imp rove a l loca t ion o f pub l ic resources to pro-poor development 
p r io r i t ies . Investment operations in selected sectors t o support NGPES pr ior i t ies , and in co l labora t ion 
w i t h other donors, w i l l complement In terna t iona l Finance Corpora t ion ( IFC) and Mu l t i la te ra l 

Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) support to pr iva te sector development and w i l l emphasize 
sector-wide approaches (SWAps) where appropriate. Du r ing the f i rs t years o f the CAS period, 
In terna t iona l Development Assoc ia t ion (IDA) lending/grants w i l l focus on key operations t o support 
the N T 2 development framework and associated social and environmental measures. The W o r l d 
B a n k w i l l also continue to wo rk c lose ly w i t h the In terna t iona l Mone tary Fund (IMF) o n i s s u e s o f 
macro-economic management and mon i tor ing . 

v i i i . 
The base case IDA a l loca t ion curren t ly provides an ind ica t ive a l loca t ion o f US$128 m i l l i o n 
over the four year per iod o f the CAS . G iven L a o PDR ’s l o w income and h i g h debt burden, i t i s 
expected that the ma jo r i ty o f IDA resources w i l l be available as grants. A l o w case scenario, 
characterized b y a weak macroeconomic stance, slow pace or serious back track ing on the r e f o rm 
agenda and imp lemen ta t ion o f the pover ty reduc t ion strategy, or a poo r ly pe r fo rm ing po r t fo l io wou ld 
p rov ide on ly US$40-60 m i l l i o n and wou ld no t inc lude subsequent PRSCs. I f there i s substantive 
non-compliance in the N T 2 project, inc lud ing non-compliance w i t h safeguard and revenue 
management undertakings, the W o r l d Bank wou ld consider even further cu r ta i l ing lend ing levels, 
inc lud ing the op t ion o f no t engaging in future f inanc ing a n d o r suspension o f the entire po r t fo l io , 
until i t i s satisfied that agreements are be ing me t and there i s adherence to commitments. I f the pace 
o f re forms and imp lemen ta t ion accelerates and s ign i f ican t add i t iona l key po l icy changes are 
undertaken, i t wou ld be expected that the Performance-based A l loca t ion (PBA ) exercise cou ld push 
L a o PDR i n t o a high case lending scenario o f about 30 percent more IDA a l loca t ion than the base 
case. These add i t iona l resources wou ld be p rov ided ma in ly through modu la ted PRSC amounts in 
support o f po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l reforms, o r through one or two add i t iona l investment operations. 

i x . 
A l though IDA resources allocated to L a o PDR are sma l l re la t ive t o ove ra l l donor support, 
the W o r l d Bank remains a lead agency in supporting L a o PDR’s development objectives and po l icy 
agenda. The W o r l d Bank i s mak ing special e f for ts to wo rk co l labora t ive ly w i t h other donors to a l ign 
programs around common frameworks and strategies. The W o r l d Bank w i l l participate ac t ive ly in 
n ew l y expanded a id coord ina t ion and sector dialogue mechanisms and promo te harmon iza t ion o f 
pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion processes. 

R i s k s

CAS imp lemen ta t ion and results are subject to mu l t ip le r i s k s , wh ich f a l l under four 
categories: risks ar is ing f r om the po ten t ia l fo r f luc tua t ing po l i t ica l comm i tmen t o r weaker po l i t ica l 
w i l l on reforms after N T 2 i s approved, as w e l l as weak imp lemen ta t ion capacity; r i s k s ar is ing f r om 
lack o f performance under the N T 2 Project; r i s k s re la t ing to the effectiveness o f support extended to 
the country b y i t s external development partners, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank; and risks ar is ing f r o m 
external factors over wh ich the Government has no control. The management o f these r i s k s w i l l 
de te rm ine the pace and d irec t ion o f fu ture p o l i c y re forms under NGPES as w e l l as imp lemen ta t ion 
performance on the N T 2 pro jec t . The proposed CAS scenarios and IDA programs are designed to 
address these issues, inc lud ing cases o f slower or faster re forms and modu la t ing levels o f IDA 
support.

L A O PDR - - COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

1. 
The last Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r the L a o People’s Democratic Repub l ic (PDR) 
cove r ing the pe r iod FY1999-FY2002 was discussed b y the W o r l d Bank‘s Boa rd o f D irec tors in April 
1999 (Report N o . 19098-LA) . Presentation o f this fo l low -on CAS was delayed so that i t cou ld be aligned 
w i t h the L a o PDR Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Na t iona l G r ow t h and Pover ty 
E rad ica t ion Strategy (NGPES), wh ich was discussed b y the Boa rd o f D irec tors in December 2004. 

2. 
The preparation o f the new CAS in L a o PDR has been subject to extensive consultations w i t h the 
Government, donors, and other stakeholders. The consultations began in early 2003 w i t h government 
representatives, mass-based organizations (MBO ) , the p r iva te sector, and p rov inc ia l authorities to so l ic i t 
feedback and strategic inputs. Fo rma l consultations w i t h the Government have been progressive w i t h 
three in te r -m in is te r ia l consultations over the last tw o years. Consultations w i t h other stakeholders 
inc lud ing b i la te ra l donors and mu l t i la te ra l organizations continued in 2004, wh ich fur ther strengthened 
e f for ts to harmonize assistance among development partners.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

3. 
L a o PDR is a small, sparsely populated, landlocked country with extensive natural resources. 
With a popu la t ion estimated at 5.7 m i l l i o n in 2004, and g row ing at a re la t ive ly rap id rate o f 2.6 percent 
annually, L a o P D R i s characterized b y a r i c h cu l tu ra l and ethnic d ivers i ty where almost h a l f o f the

square km in the center o f the dynamic Mekong region, L a o PDR shares borders w i t h Thailand, Vietnam, 
China, Cambodia, and Myanmar . A l though infrastructure-roads, 
telecom, water and electricity-is 
underdeveloped, the country i s r i c h in water resources, t rop ica l forests and minerals. A large ma jo r i ty o f

POLITICAL CONTEXT 

4. 
Lao PDR has maintained a single-party system, similar to Ch ina and Vietnam. The L a o PDR 
People’s Revo lu t ionary Party (LPRP) i s headed by the Party’s Central Comm i t tee comp r is ing 53 
members elected at the Seventh Par ty Congress in 2001. The structure o f po l i t ica l power remains 
unchanged since 1975, w i t h a top down dec is ion mak ing process that i s o f ten opaque to outsiders. A 
re la t ive ly sma l l group o f Po l i tbu ro members makes key decisions w i th in the Par ty and has considerable 
in f luence on the Government. While seven ou t o f t e n members o f the Po l i tbu ro are current or past 
m i l i t a r y members, the nex t Par ty Congress to be he ld in ear ly 2006 may ma rk a generation change as 
several older and conservative members w o u l d leave the ir p lace to the nex t generation. The Na t iona l 
Assembly, whose members are elected d i rec t ly b y the people f r o m a l i s t o f Party candidates as w e l l as 
some independent candidates, i s increas ing ly p lay ing a stronger oversight ro le . 
In the provinces, 
governments have a high degree o f autonomy over resources, expenditures, and services. A l though there 
are signals that a po l i t ica l trans i t ion i s s low ly beginning, as re f lec ted in the gradual process o f 
decentralization o f decision making, as w e l l as a greater openness in in terna l processes and a substantial 
improvemen t in the dialogue w i t h donors, i t i s l i k e l y that e f for ts to accelerate the pace o f economic 
r e f o rm w i l l s t i l l be constrained b y the ine r t ia o f the po l i t ica l cu l ture . 

Civil society has a limited but slowly expanding role. In terna t iona l NGOs have been present in 

5. 
L a o PDR fo r some time. Several in terna t iona l NGOs support knowledge sharing and ne two rk ing w i t h 
loca l c i v i l society groups and a few loca l independent associations have b e e n fo rmed recently, inc lud ing 
education support groups, economic and development support organizations and re l ig ious associations. 
Interest groups (i.e., women, youth, labor, e thn ic groups) are fo rma l ly represented b y M B O s l inked to the 
Par ty . Soc ia l accountability i s weak, but there i s po ten t ia l for M B O s to represent constituents in bo t tom- 
up po l icy fo rmu la t ion and decision-making. A l though the loca l media i s owned f u l l y b y the state, there i s 
open access to fore ign media and the in te rne t .

ECONOMIC TRANSITION A N D STRONG GROWTH 

Lao P D R has undertaken significant economic reforms to move from a command economy 

6. 
towards a market economy. When L a o PDR was established in 1975, a po l icy o f “accelerated 
socialization” was pursued, inc lud ing extensive agr icu l tura l co l lec t iv iza t ion . However , b y 1982, the use 
of “market forces” was promo ted at the Third Congress o f the LPRP and, though ha l t ing at times, there 
has been s ign i f ican t progress towards this goal. In 1986, the Government o f f ic ia l ly abandoned the central 
p lann ing system and introduced the N e w Econom ic Mechanism. Impor tan t steps were taken, such as near 
to ta l p r ice l ibera l iza t ion and exchange rate un i f ica t ion , the remova l o f the Government’s trade monopoly, 
and the opening up o f fore ign and in te r -p rov inc ia l trade. Private firms were a l lowed to enter the market 
and fam i ly farms were encouraged over collectives. The pr iva te sector began t o emerge and the number 
o f State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was reduced b y 75 percent. 

7 . 
Du r ing the 1990s, structural reforms continued more slowly and intermittently with major 
setbacks resulting from the economic crisis at the end of 

the decade. In 1991, the loss o f O f f i c i a l 
Deve lopmen t Assistance (ODA ) f o l l ow i n g the collapse o f the Soviet U n i o n stimulated a re-orientation 
towards As ian and western markets. The Government continued structural re forms in the first h a l f o f this 
period, including further e f for ts in the bank ing and SOE sectors, but these and other re forms were on ly 
pa r t ia l ly implemented. Even so, the L a o PDR economic structure gradua l ly came t o be based p r ima r i ly on 
the pr iva te sector, w i t h SOEs accounting fo r a re la t ive ly small share o f economic ac t iv i ty ; and g row th in 
trade continued, together w i t h an increase in pr iva te investment.’ Towards the end o f the 199Os, the 
coun try underwent an acute pe r iod o f macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty due to the As ian f inanc ia l cr is is and a 
breakdown in monetary and f isca l management in 1997-199tL2 In la te 1999, the Government responded 
by launch ing a successful s tab i l iza t ion program, t igh ten ing monetary and f isca l po l ic ies and by early 2001 
the currency had stabilized and in f la t ion was reduced to single digits. 

Annua l average rea l GDP growth rate was 6.3 percent between 1991 and 2000 , despite the 

8. 
re la t ive ly slow pace o f re fo rm and the As ian crisis. This compares favorab ly w i t h the g row th rates o f 
China, V ie tnam and other East As ian countries during this period. At i t s lowes t po in t (1998), g row th f e l l 
t o 4 percent. Manu fac tur ing and services were the m a i n drivers o f g row th du r ing the early 199Os, w i t h 
agr icu l ture tak ing the lead during the later years. Na tu ra l resources also con tr ibu ted s ign i f ican t ly to 
g row th during the early 1990s, but this dropped o f f w i t h a decline in forestry sector con tr ibu t ions . Expor ts 
grew at an annual rate o f 27 percent during 1990-1995, but expor t g row th f e l l t o on ly 2 percent a year 
during 1995-2000. 

Du r ing 2001-2004, increased government commitment accelerated the pace of reforms. This

’ SOEs accounted for 1 percent o f employment, 20 percent o f manufacturing output, and 30 percent o f bank credit in 2002, and 
private investment represented 10.1 percent o f GDP in 2003.

bank ing and ru ra l finance, SOEs, forestry, trade and the p r iva te sector, as w e l l as b y the continued 
s tab i l iza t ion p rog ram that has tightened monetary and f isca l po l ic ies and reduced in f la t ion to single d ig i ts . 
Nevertheless, the Government’s f isca l pos i t ion has continued to rema in frag i le w i t h re la t ive ly weak 
revenue performance, weak pub l ic sector management, a weak bank ing sector, and poo r ly managed 
rema in ing SOEs. Some progress has been made in imp rov ing pub l ic expenditure management, inc lud ing 
pub l ica t ion o f the State Budget, creation o f a central Procurement Mon i to r ing Unit and State Audit 
Organization. The Government has also implemented an ambitious decentralization po l icy , intended to 
bring decision mak ing closer to the f ie ld level, but this has, unfortunately, made f isca l management more 
d i f f icu l t . Furthermore, there has been l i t t l e progress in re fo rm ing c i v i l service management and pay. 
Overa l l , pub l ic adm in is tra t ion r e f o rm has proved much more difficult to imp lemen t than the f i rs t wave o f 
economic reforms. 

Real GDP growth averaged slightly lower but still a robust rate of 5.6percent a year between 

10. 
2001 and 2004. Annua l g row th reached 6 percent in 2004. A l l sectors - agriculture, manufacturing, 
tou r ism as w e l l as mining and hydropower - grew du r ing this per iod , w i t h mining tak ing o f f fo r the f i rs t 
time. Pr iva te investment, especially fore ign investment, showed a persistent increase over these f ive 
years, albeit f r om a very l o w level, but grow ing to nearly 10 percent o f GD P in 2004. W h i l e there were 
investments in tou r ism and garments, most o f this increase in 2003 and 2004 came f r om fore ign 
investment in the m i n i n g sector, especially in copper and gold. Expo r t g row th stagnated du r ing the 2000- 
2003 period, but jumped in 2004 to a rate o f 18 percent, d r iven ma in ly b y garments, electricity, m in ing 
and ~ o f f e e , ~ w i t h mos t o f i t go ing to A S E A N countries and China. 

The macroeconomic situation has been significantly better during the 2001-2004 period than 

11. 
in the previous four years. Head l ine in f la t ion averaged 11 percent a year du r ing the 2001-2004 pe r iod 
compared to an average of near ly 70 percen t a year during 1997-2000. There has been a no tewor thy 
improvemen t in ove ra l l macroeconomic performance over the last fou r years4, although L a o PDR’s track 
record o f ma in ta in ing single-digit in f la t ion rates over a long pe r iod remains weak. Nevertheless, the short- 
term macroeconomic s i tua t ion i s satisfactory, as end-o f-per iod in f la t ion rate reached single digits (Le. 8.6 
percent) in December 2004. 

This performance was helped by signifcant fiscal adjustment. In 2002/03 when revenue f r om 

12. 
timber royalties and other non- tax revenue f e l l b y near ly 2 percent o f GDP, the ove ra l l f isca l de f ic i t (after 
grants) jumped (F igure 1). The needed f isca l adjustment took p lace in 2003/04. V igorous government 
e f for ts to mob i l ize taxes in 2003/04 combined w i t h the fu l l-year impac t o f pe tro leum taxes increased tax 
revenue (exc lud ing t imber roya l t ies) f r om 8.1 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 to 8.9 percent o f GDP in 
2003/045 h igh l igh t ing a s ign i f ican t add i t iona l tax e f fo r t o f 0.8 percent o f GDP . This led to a modest 
increase in to ta l revenue o f 0.1 percent o f GDP @e., f r om 11.1 to 11.2 percent), because there were 
o f fse t t ing declines in co l lec t ions f r o m timber royalties, non- tax revenue and impo r t tax revenue (due to 
AFTA ta r i f f reductions) in that year. Expenditures were reduced b y 1.8 percent o f GDP, and the f isca l 
de f ic i t f e l l accord ing ly in 2003/04. This helped to keep domestic f inanc ing o f the deficit l o w and 
con tr ibu ted to bringing in f la t ion down to single digits in December 2004. 

13. 
progress will be slow. A l though the revenue e f fo r t in L a o P D R i s l o w re la t ive to many o f i t s neighbors, 

Structural constraints to sustainably increase revenues have begun to be addressed, but 

I n the same period, imports grew 23 percent and consisted o f machinery, equipment, and raw material for the garment industry. 
Large discrepancies exist among estimates o f exports and imports provided by different agencies in Lao PDR. Discrepancies in 
Lao PDR export and import data were described i n the World Bank Economic Monitor (May 2004 issue). 
During this period, monetary policy was geared towards reducing inflation. Credit growth has thus remained subdued in 2004 
with broad money growing at around 20 percent. T h i s was made possible by the avoidance o f bank financing o f the budget.

the d i f ference narrows markedly once revenue i s expressed as a share o f non-agr icu l tura l GDP, where 
L a o PDR stands at 18 percen t compared to V ie tnam ’s 20 percent and Cambodia’s 12 percent. Progress in 
ach iev ing L a o PDR’s revenue po ten t ia l w i l l be s low due to inadequate technical capacity o f revenue 
adm in is tra t ion and a h igh ly decentralized revenue administration in wh ich provinces curren t ly have weak 
incentives to co l lec t and r em i t revenue to the na t iona l budget. In early 2004, the Government took several 
correc t ive measures: re-establishing central con t ro l over seven ma in in terna t iona l checkpoints w i t h 
revenue co l lec ted deposited in to central government accounts; increasing con t ro l over ma jo r p rov inc ia l 
large tax-payers units, mod i fy ing regulations to p rov ide greater con t ro l b y the center over gran t ing o f tax 
exemptions to investors; and frequent mon i to r ing o f p rov inc ia l revenue co l lec t ion and remittance to the 
na t iona l budget. But more w i l l need to be done i f the revenue share o f GDP i s to reach i t s po ten t ia l .

Lao PDR is increasing its integration, both regionally and globally. Sub-regionally, L a o PDR i s 
an active partner in the emerging Greater M e k o n g Subregion (GMS) Econom ic Cooperation Program 
(consisting o f Thailand, Myanmar , Yunnan p rov ince o f China, Vietnam, Cambod ia and L a o PDR). The

POVERTY REDUCT ION A N D SOC IAL DEVELOPMENT 

15. 
Economic progress has resulted in a substantial reduction in poverty over the past decade, 
although poverty remains high. The incidence o f poverty f e l l f r om 46 percent in 1992 to 33 percent in 
2002-2003 (Table 1). This i s an impressive achievement, wh ich suggests that L a o PDR i s on track in 
terms o f mee t ing the pover ty M i l l e n n i um Development Goa l (MDG) b y 2015 i f i t i s able to ma in ta in the 
pace o f progress. Pover ty reduc t ion was more rap id in ru ra l areas than in urban areas, and faster in the 
no r th than in the center or south. As consumption increased more in villages than in cities, overa l l 
inequa l i ty declined. The Gini index o f per capita rea l consumption f e l l f r o m 34.9 in 1997-1999 to 33 in 
2002-2003. In spite o f the progress, pover ty in L a o PDR remains among the highest in the region. Poverty 
in the uplands i s 43 percent, compared to on ly 28 percent in the lowlands. Pover ty in the Government’s 
designated 47 p r io r i ty districts i s tw ice as high as in the 7 0 non -p r io r i ty districts. A vast ma jo r i ty o f the

Social indicators have improved somewhat, but are not commensurate with economic 
improvements and remain 
low compared to regional and 
lower-income country averages. 
Improvements were achieved between 1990 and 2000 on a number o f social ind ica tors inc lud ing c h i l d 
mor ta l i ty , gender equality, pa r t icu la r ly in p r ima ry enrollment, and child ma lnu tr i t ion . However , most 
social indicators s t i l l f a l l w e l l be low the average o f East As ian countries (Table 2). A l though trends in 
education showed promise in the early 1990s, improvements s lowed down in 1998 f o l l ow i n g the f inanc ia l 
crisis, are yet to recover fu l ly , and the coun try risks no t reach ing the un iversa l comp le t ion o f p r ima ry 
education goal b y 2015 (Figure 2). M i n i s t r y o f Educa t ion data fo r 2001/02 showed a n e t enro l lmen t ra t io 
o f 8 1 percent. However, household survey data fo r the same year showed a much lowe r net enrollment 
ra t io o f 62 percent and o f on ly 45 percent f o r ch i ldren in the poorest income qu in t i le . Ma te rna l and ch i ld 
mo r ta l i ty and mo rb id i ty are s t i l l h i g h b y reg iona l standards, as i s c h i l d ma lnu tr i t ion . Hea l th care 
u t i l iza t ion i s l o w ( less than 30 percent), and qua l i ty o f services i s poor . Access to an imp roved water 
source i s available to 37 percent o f the population, far be low the reg iona l average o f 76 percent. The 
percentage o f paved roads in L a o PDR (15 percent) i s among the lowes t in the reg ion . 

17. 
The reasons behind these poor social outcomes are multiple and inter-related. They include: 
widespread pover ty and high leve ls o f vu lne rab i l i ty wh ich render many basic services unaffordable to the 
poor; geographic iso la t ion and inadequate infrastructure wh ich hinder phys ica l access; language and 

- 6 - 

cu l tu ra l barriers; and poor service qua l i ty due to l o w levels o f resources and l o w capacity o f providers. 
Expenditures o n education and health in 2001 were 1.9 percent and 1 percent o f GDP, respectively. 
Commun i t ies f inance 30-40 percent o f capital expenditures in education and patients and NGOs pay fo r 
most hea l th expenditures (60 percent and 25 percent, respectively). Na t iona l hea l th spending was on ly 
U S $ l l per cap i ta (ha l f the reg iona l average). In re la t ive terms, L a o PDR i s the lowes t rank ing East As ian 
coun try on the U N D P Human Development Index (2003), where i t places 1 3 l S t out o f 148 countries. 
Weaknesses in the educational and health systems, and in basic service de l ivery systems, w i l l continue to 
hamper improvemen t in the social indicators, un less key structural issues -- l o w and ine f f ic ien t use o f

Vulnerability remains high, especially for ethnic minority and upland communities. Fo r ty -e igh t 

18. 
percent o f the popu la t ion belongs to one o f the 49 ethnic m i n o r i t y groups. M o s t l i v e in the up land areas 
where l ive l ihood systems are delicately balanced and poor communications exacerbate the challenge o f 
p rov id ing social services. Each ethnic group has i t s ow n culture and trad i t ions that dictate cropp ing cycles 
and patterns, as w e l l as inheritance, health care, and l i f e cyc le events. This r i c h cu l tura l d ivers i ty makes 
service p rov is ion complex. The re la t ionsh ip between peop le and the env ironmen t in these fragile, yet 
resource r i c h areas, i s easily upset. Roads and infrastructure, essential fo r imp rov ing access to services 
and developing na tura l resources, also bring threats o f logg ing and unsustainable development and 
programs that a im to limit o p i um produc t ion or stabilize shifting cu l t iva t ion may raise the risk o f reduc ing 
access o f up land communities to the forests and forest products on wh ich they depend. The safety ne t 
system in L a o PDR i s underdeveloped and vulnerable groups are especially suscep t ib le to shocks that 
affect r i c e yields and l ives tock . A further comp l ica t ion i s the severe con tam ina t ion b y Unexp loded 
Ordnances (UXO) in ten o f 18 provinces, wh ich adds costs to in fras truc ture development and contributes 
to pover ty b y limiting agr icu l tura l produc t ion . W i t h respect to labor conditions, L a o PDR has ra t i f ied on ly 
one o f the fundamental labor standards conventions (No. 29 on Forced Labor) , although another f i v e 
conventions are curren t ly under consideration. W h i l e the L a o Labo r L a w does con fo rm in p r inc ip le t o 
some basic labor standards, i t does no t o f fe r adequate enforcement. An t i -d isc r im ina t ion leg is la t ion also 
exists but enforcement i s again weak.

Progress has been made in improving the well-being of women, but significant challenges

remain. At 27.3 percent, women’s par t ic ipa t ion in the Na t iona l Assembly i s one o f the highest in the

GOVERNANCE ISSUES 

Lao P D R governance indicators stand below regional and global averages. In 2003, L a o PDR’s 

20. 
Coun try Po l icy and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment (CP IA ) ra t ings fo r key governance ind ica tors were be low the 
IDA average (Figure 3).’ L a o PDR was close t o IDA averages fo r proper ty rights and governance, and fo r 
revenue mob i l iza t ion , but i t was lowe r on budget and f inanc ia l management, and seriously lowe r on 
transparency and accountability. The IMF ranked L a o PDR’ s pub l ic expenditure systems be low that o f 24 

For example, literacy rates for the majority Lao PDR Phutai are 84 percent for males and 62 percent for females, while among 
Hmong-Yao ethnic groups i t i s 45 percent for males and only 8 percent for females.

I n Apr i l 2003, the Government developed a governance reform program’ based on actions in 
four priority areas: ( i ) public service reform; ( i i ) people’s participation; ( i i i ) the rule of 
law; and ( iv ) 

sound financial management. E f fo r ts are underway on a p i l o t basis to imp rove the management o f 
pub l ic adm in is tra t ion through increased professionalism and merit-based recruitment. Other efforts to 
imp rove pub l ic sector management include d ra f t ing an an t i-corrup t ion decree, increasing transparency in 
the accounting and audit functions, imp rov ing tax adm in is tra t ion and establishing checks and balances in 
the c i v i l service. W o r k on strengthening participation, encouraging loca l empowerment and c la r i fy ing

Capacity constraints are a significant challenge in Lao PDR and con tr ibu te t o poo r performance 

on CPIA indicators. W h i l e pub l ic sector s ta f f are educated,’ gaps in incentives, competencies, and s k i l l 
types and d is tr ibu t ion prevent key func t ions f r om be ing per formed e f fec t ive ly . Shortages o f management

structures and basic management systems are no t aligned w i t h development pr ior i t ies . Centralized 
dec is ion-mak ing o f ten discourages loca l in i t ia t ives while l o w pay levels, delays in payment (especially in 
ru ra l areas), and lack o f performance-based promotions may act as disincentives. D is t inc t ions between 
legislative, executive, and jud ic ia l functions are blurred. Decision-makers are o f ten isolated f r om the c i v i l 
service and conversely, c i v i l servants are o f ten poo r ly in fo rmed about government po l icy , leg is la t ion and 
even adm in is tra t ive procedures. Government controls on pr iva te sector activities inc lude cumbersome 
investment procedures and annual tax licenses. While the Government has expressed strong preference 
fo r loca l expertise to p rov ide technical assistance, there are few consultants w i t h the requisite s k i l l s , o f ten 
h inder ing donor e f for ts to build capacity. 

23. 
The Government is taking a number of steps to address capacity constraints. Commun i ty 
development projects and ac t iv i t ies are bu i ld ing capacity at the f i e l d leve l to prepare, imp lemen t and 
mon i to r outcomes o f loca l investments. Recogn i t ion o f the challenges posed b y ASEAN and W T O 
accession has spurred openness to learning f r om the experience o f China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and 
Tha i land and encouraged g row ing t i e s w i t h ne ighbor ing countries and an examination o f the ir r e f o rm 
processes. C i v i l servant tra in ing has been expanded and d ivers i f ied , and modern public sector and 
economic management concepts have entered the curriculum o f degree courses.

LAO PDR’s DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND CHALLENGES 

A. 

COUNTRY VISION 

24. 
The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES ) is a government-owned 
strategy that lays out Lao PDR ’s development vision. L a o PDR ’s NGPES i s the first full pover ty 
reduc t ion strategy prepared b y the Government and seeks to he lp the coun try meet i t s MDGs b y 2015 and 
graduate f r o m L D C status b y 2020. The three p i l la rs o f the strategy are to: (i) foster economic g row th 
w i t h equity; (ii) develop and modernize L a o PDR ’s social and economic infrastructure; and (iii) enhance 
human resource development. The NGPES s tresses 
the Government’s comm i tmen t to sound 
macroeconomic po l ic ies to sustain growth, and prudent monetary and f isca l po l ic ies comb ined w i t h 
broad-based structural re forms to promote p r iva te sector-led development. 

25. 
The NGPES was developed in a participatory and consultative manner. The NGPES 
Committee, fo rmed to oversee the process, drew membership f r om key m i n i s t r i e s and agencies, and 
representatives f r om M BO s . A government-implemented Par t ic ipa t ion Ac t ion P lan fo r NGPES 
development was supported by the UNDP, the W o r l d Bank , and other donors. Intensive consultations 
were carried out w i t h donor partners in the context o f the 7* and 8” Round Tab le meetings fo r the Interim 
PRSP and NGPES f ina l report, respectively. The consu l ta t ion process was broadened to inc lude 
par t ic ipa t ion b y in terna t iona l NGOs and the pr iva te sector. In add i t ion to consultations w i t h o f f i c i a l 
MBOs , such as the L a o PDR F ron t fo r Na t iona l Cons truc t ion and the L a o PDR Women’s Un ion , 
discussions were held w i t h p rov inc ia l governments, med ia and academics. The document was submitted 
to the Na t iona l Assembly in October 2003, wh ich approved i t after a four-day workshop. 

26. 
The NGPES is a major step forward that builds o n the country’s po ten t ia l fo r g row th (Box 1). 
The strategy: (i) acknowledges the importance o f governance challenges; (ii) begins to articulate so l id 
strategies fo r imp rov ing service de l ivery and infrastructure; (iii) se ts appropriate directions fo r sustaining 
growth; ( iv) seeks to address inequ i ty and vu lnerab i l i ty ; and (v) prov ides a framework fo r mon i to r ing and 
implementation. The NGPES also recognizes the importance o f imp rov ing L a o PDR’ s in terna t iona l 
competitiveness, attracting FDI, and under tak ing governance re forms . I t emphasizes the value o f r u r a l 
infrastructure and the need to enhance human development through a strong agenda f o r imp rov ing

together w i t h a clear p lan fo r imp lemen t ing i t s objectives and a mechanism fo r mon i to r ing progress. I t 
w i l l also requ ire strong po l i t ica l leadership to overcome the challenges that w i l l arise du r ing 
imp lemen ta t ion . 

Box 1: Sources o f G r o w t h 

L a o PDR has a number o f s ign i f ican t assets and resources to promo te strong g row th and development. This po ten t ia l 
can o n l y b e realized, however, i f na tura l resources are well-managed. Lega l , regu la tory and tax weaknesses, as w e l l 
as ins t i tu t iona l and organizational capacity t o manage the benefits f r om natural resource use must also be addressed 
in order t o attract and secure domestic and in terna t iona l cap i ta l fo r pub l ic and pr iva te partnerships. 

Ag r i cu l tu r e - There i s considerable po ten t ia l f o r near ly t r i p l i n g the area n ow under cu l t iva t ion f o r annual and

K E Y DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

The NGPES outlines the key challenges that must be overcome in order for L a o PDR to reach 

27. 
its economic and soc ia l development goals. The analysis in the NGPES, the related Jo in t S ta f f Adv iso ry 
No te (JSAN, Report No. 29966), discussed by the Boa rd in December 2004, and the W o r l d Bank ’s 
Coun try Econom ic Memorandum (CEM) h igh l igh ts a range o f actions necessary to meet the overarching 
objectives o f sustaining L a o PDR’s g row th and pover ty reduc t ion performance wh i le at the same t ime 
imp rov ing social outcomes. To continue the momen tum o f the past decade, prudent macroeconomic 
management w i l l need to be complemented w i t h continued, deepened economic re forms t o imp rove the 
p roduc t iv i ty o f agriculture and other sectors, strengthen the enabling env ironmen t f o r trade and the 
p r iva te sector, and ensure a more sustainable and equitable use o f na tura l resources. To convert this 
g row th i n t o improved social outcomes, strengthened pub l ic sector management, especially o f pub l ic 
finances, w i l l be cr i t ica l , as w i l l mo re accountable and w e l l targeted service de l ivery , and a 
comprehensive, people-centered approach to reduc ing pove r ty in up land areas. In short, in i t s nex t phase 
o f development, L a o PDR needs to deepen and broaden sources o f g row th and increased produc t iv i ty , 
tackle the d i f f icu l t ins t i tu t iona l and systemic challenges o f public expenditure management fo r pro-poor 
service delivery, and develop e f fec t ive commun i ty-based pover ty reduc t ion strategies. Re inv igo ra t ing 
e f for ts to mob i l ize revenues w i l l be cen tra l to the Government’s e f for ts to ma in ta in macroeconomic 

- 1 1 - 

s tab i l i ty wh i le mak ing progress in addressing the country’s pressing development needs. Las t ing re fo rm 
o f the state-owned banks and enterprises i s also essential to ensuring a sustainable f isca l outlook. 

28. 
First, sustaining growth w i l l require a strong economic environment where the various sectors 
can accelerate productivity and benefit from linkages to dynamic regional markets. The NGPES 

recognizes that g row th w i l l need to be sustained through trade l ibera l iza t ion , h igher agr icu l tura l 
produc t iv i ty , and pr iva te sector development. Wh i le past agr icu l tura l g row th rates have been among the 
highest in the region, fur ther g row th in the sector w i l l require increased d ive rs i f ica t ion and management 
o f risks associated w i t h household food security, as w e l l as improvements in proper ty r igh ts and land 
titling. Imp rov ing the performance o f the manufacturing and services sectors w i l l requ ire greater e f for ts in 
creating a favorable business environment, developing market institutions, 
fac i l i ta t ing o f f - fa rm 
opportunities and reg iona l linkages, 
increasing the competitiveness o f the p r iva te sector, and 
imp lemen t ing las t ing enterprise and f inanc ia l sector reforms. Imp rov ing exports w i l l also require further 
l ibera l iza t ion o f the trade regime. The de l ivery o f infrastructure services (transport, communication, 
energy, water and sanitation), inc lud ing adequate f inanc ing to ma in ta in ex is t ing stocks and improve 
access, w i l l be essential and w i l l need to be developed in a concerted e f fo r t w i t h GMS partners. The 
NGPES appropriately se ts ambitious g row th and macro- f isca l targets, but ach iev ing these goals w i l l 
require s ign i f ican t structural and governance reforms, d isc ip l ined monetary and f isca l policies, a realistic 
and transparent budge t ing process, and the e f fec t ive management o f revenues f r om na tura l resources. 

29 . 
Second, strengthening public f inanc ia l management, governance and comprehensive 
community-driven p lann ing processes w i l l be key to improving social outcomes and reducing 

vulnerability. Successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the NGPES and progress towards the MDGs w i l l require a 
sh i f t in resources toward NGPES pr ior i t ies and improvements in expenditure management, par t icu lar ly 
regarding expenditure p lann ing and budgeting, the qua l i ty and coverage o f f inanc ia l repor t ing and 
pred ic tab i l i ty in budget execution. The pub l ic expenditure management r e f o rm agenda should be 
complemented b y reforms in cen tra l- loca l government relations and c i v i l service pay and management. 
Po l icy guidance on these issues i s expected to emerge f r o m the fo r thcom ing Par ty Congress. Bo ld , 
innova t ive steps w i l l have to be taken to t ru ly improve social outcomes inc lud ing imp rov ing the access, 
targeting, and e f f ic iency o f service de l ivery , developing adequate pay and emp loymen t po l ic ies in the 
social sectors, exp lo r ing alternative options fo r service de l ivery to remo te communities, and tak ing an 
integrated approach to imp rov ing up land ru ra l l ive l ihoods . Comprehensive approaches that include 
community-based par t ic ipa tory p lann ing processes w i l l be needed t o make the mos t e f fec t ive use o f 
resources allocated fo r pove r ty reduc t ion in the poorest areas. M o r e resources w i l l need to be directed to 
education and health as w e l l as red irec t ing limited resources to ensure greater access o f the poor and 
vulnerable to qua l i ty basic services. 

30. 
Th ird , management of natura l resources and the environment must be strengthened so that the 
country’s natural endowments can contribute effectively towards growth, poverty reduction, and social 

improvements. Imp roved management o f forestry, hydropower, and mining resources i s requ ired because 
o f their po ten t ia l con t r ibu t ion to revenues that can be used fo r pove r ty reduction, growth-related 
investments and imp roved social and environmental outcomes and because o f the need to protect the 
na tura l environment. Issues that need to be addressed inc lude strengthening o f the framework fo r pr iva te- 
pub l ic partnerships that cou ld bring in the needed investment as w e l l as managerial capacity, 
strengthening o f government capacity at the central and p rov inc ia l leve ls to manage complex m u l t i - 
sectoral activities and promo te opportunities fo r stakeholders to par t ic ipa te in pro jec t design and 
implementation, and strengthening o f the pub l ic f inanc ia l management arrangements t o ensure proper 
u t i l iza t ion o f revenues. Improvemen ts in the po l ic ies and imp lemen ta t ion arrangements to manage social 
and environmental impacts are also essential, inc lud ing r e f o rm o f the lega l and ins t i tu t iona l framework 
governing the environment, strengthened institutions, better coordination, greater par t ic ipa t ion and 
transparency, and stronger l a w enforcement. 

- 1 2 - 

3 1, 
Fourth , building capacity is a key challenge in implementing and monitoring the NGPES . The 
NGPES sees capacity development as essential to improved governance and pub l ic adm in is tra t ion and 
achievement o f NGPES pr ior i t ies . The NGPES recognizes the need fo r a more comprehensive approach 
to deve lop ing capacity and expresses the Government's intent to: (i) develop an inven tory o f current 
capacity building in i t ia t ives ; (ii) iden t i fy and p r io r i t ize capacity bu i ld ing requirements at a l l levels and 
prepare a framework fo r imp lemen ta t ion of capacity building programs; (iii) create a comprehensive 
capacity building strategy based on these assessments; and ( iv) imp lemen t the strategy through an 
approach that ensures coord ina t ion between the various levels o f government and development partners. 
Trans la t ing these pr ior i t ies in to concrete actions w i l l be difficult, however, and w i l l requ ire a long-term, 
systematic approach. An e f fec t ive mon i to r ing and evaluation (M&E) system fo r the NGPES w i l l need to 
be put in place, us ing par t ic ipa tory processes to update and re f ine the strategy and ac t ion programs on a 
continuous basis. 

C. MEDIUM-TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

32. 
Economic growth is projected to be strong, averaging 6.3 percent a year over the CAS-period 
(Table 3). This i s in l i n e w i t h the med ium- term IMF assessment as reported in i t s November 2004 A r t ic le 
I V Consu l ta t ion report. G row th w i l l be d r iven in large measure b y the jump in fore ign investment in f lows 
in mining and hydropower sectors, as w e l l as b y g row th in m ine ra l exports. Improvements in the 
macroeconomic s i tua t ion and investment c l ima te over the last two years w i l l also contribute to sustaining 
rates o f domestic pr iva te investment and g row th in other exports. The la t ter i s l i k e l y to be supported b y 
the pro jec ted strong reg iona l expansion and the new ly-gran ted NTR b y the United States, though garment 
exports w i l l be hurt b y the exp i ry o f the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) in 2005.

Private investment and exports w i l l perform better too. The rising trend in pr iva te investment 
that L a o PDR has experienced over the last tw o years i s expected to continue, reaching an average o f 
around 12 percent of GDP, ma in ly due to h igher fo re ign investments. The do l lar value of exports i s p ro -

Implementation of AFTA" and commitments under the United States Bilateral Trade 
Agreement are expected to improve investor perceptions. Con t inued in tegra t ion o f L a o PDR i s expected 

l o Ongoing investments by an Australian mining company, Oxiana, in a new copper m i n e (opening next year) and expansion o f 
i t s existing gold mine over the next few years, w i l l boost both foreign investment inflows and exports. Agreements w i th other 
mining companies for additional new foreign investments are in process, but they are not factored into the above projection. 
However, though final decision on NT 2 i s awaited, N T 2 investments are factored into the above projection as the base-case.

to d r ive other reforms that w i l l be needed to face reg iona l compe t i t ion and to expand exports successfully. 
This includes ASEAN and GMS in i t ia t ives that are aimed at fac i l i ta t ing reg iona l trade as w e l l as trade o f 
L a o PDR through neighbors’ seaports. Those other reforms also inc lude further l ibe ra l iza t ion o f pr iva te 
bus iness reg is tra t ion and o f pr iva te investment regulations, w i thou t wh ich the pr iva te sector cannot 
exp lo i t the new opportunities fo r agr icu l tura l and manufactured exports resu l t ing f r o m increasing 
in tegra t ion . S im i lar ly , infrastructure improvements, especially roads and ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion , as w e l l as 
greater openness to pr iva te investment in the telecommunications sector, w i l l be key in sustaining 
reg iona l exports and strong agr icu l tura l and manufacturing grow th . I2 Unless L a o PDR ensures that 
imp lemen ta t ion o f other reforms and improvements in infrastructure accompany increased in tegra t ion 
w i t h the reg ion and the world, sustaining GDP g row th rates o f 6-7 percent a year fo r the rest o f the decade 
w i l l be d i f f icu l t . 

35. 
Inf lat ion in December 2004 was in single digits, but only continued vigilance can maintain that 
over the medium-term. There are s ign i f ican t pressures fo r increases in the c i v i l service wages and g iven 
how l o w the wages are, these pressures are legitimate. However, i t i s essential to ensure that the annual 
increments in the to ta l wage-b i l l do no t outpace the annual increments in revenue so that f isca l 
sustainability i s assured. The 2004105 budget approved b y the Na t iona l Assembly in October 2004 sought 
larger increases in salaries and  allowance^'^ than wou ld be appropriate fo r f isca l sustainability and the 
revenue performance in the f i r s t quarter o f 2004/05 con f i rm that the risk o f the proposed increases in 
wage -b i l l outpacing revenue increases was real. The Government has thus revised the 2004/05 budget and 
i s comm i t ted to subm i t t ing the revisions to the Na t iona l Assembly at i t s nex t session in late April 2005.14

IMF decided no t to complete the fou r th review. As this situation w i l l continue until the Government 
requests a successor PRGF, IMF s ta f f w i l l now undertake at least tw o missions to the country each year, 
one o f wh ich w i l l co inc ide w i t h A r t ic le I V Consultations, and w i l l prov ide an assessment o f the 
macroeconomic s i tua t ion to the W o r l d Bank after these missions. Fund and Bank s ta f f w i l l continue their 
close co l labora t ion during these missions. 

The base medium-term outlook is not without downside risks. The f i rs t relates to risk o f fa i lure 

38. 
to sustain macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and thus to ma in ta in l o w in f la t ion and stable exchange rates. 
Economy -w ide pressures fo r increases in the wage-bill, p rov inc ia l demands fo r expanding domestically- 
financed cap i ta l spending and the poss ib i l i ty o f a s lowdown in revenue re forms are key risks that w i l l 
have t o be managed over the med ium- term . The Government’s adop t ion o f a f ive-year pub l ic expenditure 
management strengthening program (PEMSP), including a rev iew o f center-province f isca l relations, 
imp lemen ta t ion o f i n i t i a l actions to centralize customs and tax adm in is tra t ion as w e l l as the recent 
rev is ion o f the 2004/05 budget a imed at reduc ing wage increases to f isca l ly sustainable levels, a l l he lp to 
m i t iga te these risks in the short-term. The second risk arises f r o m the absence o f the I M F ’ s PRGF 
program and the resu l t ing reduc t ion in mon i to r ing and dialogue o f the IMF w i t h the Government on 
macroeconomic performance o f L a o PDR. The W o r l d Bank w i l l w o r k closely w i t h the IMF s ta f f du r ing 
this period, especially through the semi-annual missions mentioned above, to m i t iga te this risk. The third 
risk relates to d isrup t ion in the planned i n f l ow o f m in ing and hydropower investments over the nex t 3-4 
years. This risk i s probab ly low , g iven the strong comm i tmen t o f h igh - leve l po l icymakers in L a o PDR to 
these projects. The four th risk relates to a s lowdown in imp lemen ta t ion o f other reforms and in 
improvements and investments in infrastructure, bo th c r i t ica l fo r sustaining g row th in agr icu l tura l and 
manu fac tur ing sectors and their exports. G iven the h is tory o f re forms in L a o PDR , and the ambivalence 
that exists among the top leadership about the pace and content o f reforms, this risk i s quite real. While 
such a s lowdown may n o t affect the planned fore ign investments described above, they w i l l certainly 
weaken the broad-based nature o f g row th that L a o PDR has experienced in the past and slow down 
overa l l grow th .

EXTERNAL DEBT 

39 . 
The most recent Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)” concludes that i n the medium-term L a o 
PDR ’s debt service burden is manageable, provided economic reforms-especially on the fiscal front- 

are maintained. Sens i t iv i ty analysis reveals that i f the pace o f economic re forms falters and export and 
GDP g row th slows, the debt service burden wou ld rise. W h i l e the r a t i o of debt sew ice- to exports wou ld 
s t i l l rema in be low the c r i t ica l threshold value established fo r countries l i k e L a o PDR w i t h s im i lar po l icy 
and ins t i tu t iona l environment, the debt service-to-revenue r a t i o wou ld rise. 

The high stock of external debt places Lao P D R in a high-risk category among low income

countries. The coun try cou ld be po ten t ia l ly e l ig ib le fo r H I P C debt re l ie f , a l though the authorities have 
stated that they do no t intend to ava i l themselves o f such re l ie f . The i r v iew i s that the transactions costs o f

The biggest b i la te ra l creditor i s Russia, wh ich accounted fo r almost 80 percent o f the stock o f b i la tera l

US$387 m i l l ion , after app ly ing a 70 pe rcen t up f ron t discount and an exchange rate o f 0.6 rubles to the 
do l la r and this i s pa r t o f the base-line scenario. 

42. 
The Lao PDR authorities have approached Russia for more concessional terms. A 
rescheduling o f the stock o f Russian debt closer to Naples terms cou ld lower the debt service-to-revenue 
ra t io o f L a o PDR b y 1-2 percentage po in ts per year between 2004 and 2010. 

43. 
The baseline scenario (para. 32) which reflects continuing economic reform and good policy 
implementation would result in a fa l l in the public sector borrowing requirement over time. The debt 
stock indicators wou ld dec l ine continuously over the pro jec t ion period, though rema in ing above the 
threshold value. On the other hand, the debt s e w i c e indicators wou ld rema in be low the c r i t ica l thresholds

Sensitivity analysis shows that the effects of a slowdown in reforms accompanied by slower

THE WORLD BANK IN LAO PDR: LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE 

45. 
The present CAS is f irm ly rooted in the findings and lessons from operational experience 
during the last CAS period, as w e l l as an extensive set of evaluations, reviews, and consultations. These 
have inc luded an Operations Eva lua t ion Department Pro jec t Performance Assessment Repor t (2002).

The lending and AAA program under the last CAS has been largely delivered, although with 
considerable delays in certain cases. Lending, wh ich had averaged about US$42 m i l l i o n in the early

The fundamental objectives of the 1999 CAS-reducing poverty, returning the country to a 
path of sustained G D P growth of 6-7 percent per year, and improving social indicators-were 
largely 
met, Pover ty has lessened s ign i f ican t ly , a l though absolute levels rema in high and urban-rura l and reg iona l 
disparities continue to pers is t . C A S recommendations fo r s tab i l iz ing the economy and undertaking 
structural reforms were no t achieved during the first two years o f CAS implementation, but the 
macroeconomic stabilization measures put in place in la te 1999/2000 were imp lemen ted and a p rog ram o f 
structural reforms began. G row th rema ined strong ove ra l l during the C A S per iod . Soc ia l ind ica tors have 
improved, although in many cases at s ign i f ican t ly lowe r levels than needed to meet MDGs. 

48. 
Dialogue and engagement between Lao P D R and the World Bank have strengthened since the 
last CAS, catalyzed by preparation of the NGPES , engagement in the preparation of the Nam Theun 2 
(N T 2 ) hydropower project, and government interest in regional integration. During the i n i t i a l CAS 
years o f macro ins tab i l i ty , the W o r l d B a n k canceled the second tranche o f the Third Structural 
Ad jus tmen t Credit and the IMF did n o t resume a program. The W o r l d Bank con t inued invo lvemen t 

- 1 7 - 

through AAA and an upgraded f i e l d presence. D ia logue and progress on the r e f o rm agenda increased, 
centered on government preparation o f an In te r im PRSP (FYO1). Renewed interest in the N T 2 pro jec t led 
to a resump t ion o f engagement and the ar t icu la t ion w i t h the Government o f a Dec is ion Framework to 
guide W o r l d B a n k support. L ikew ise , government commitment 
to reg iona l in tegra t ion w i t h i t s 
membership in A S E A N and AFTA prov ided an add i t iona l impetus f o r re fo rm . The F M A C supported key 
pub l ic sector, SOE, and f inanc ia l sector reforms and L a o PDR met a l l 17 actions fo r release o f the second 
tranche, establishing a track record o f re form . The W o r l d Bank-government re la t ionsh ip and trust have 
continued to improve , w i t h government adoption o f an ambitious pover ty reduc t ion strategy, the NGPES, 
and increasing momen tum fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f a wide-ranging r e f o rm agenda. 

49. 
The experiences gained from the implementation and evaluation of the last CAS have provided 
a number of important lessons: 

Ownership i s essential to ensure sustainability) takes time to develop, and requires an open and 
w e l l supported dialogue. An in fo rma l rev iew o f performance under the 1999 CAS found that 
a l though the CAS and the Government’s Na t iona l Socio-Economic Deve lopmen t P lan (SEDP) shared 
a common ob jec t ive o f pover ty reduction, the Government and the W o r l d Bank (and other 
In terna t iona l F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions) d i f fe red s ign i f ican t ly on development pr ior i t ies . The Government 
p r io r i ty on food security did no t ma tch key CAS emphases on macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and deepened 
structural reforms. This m isma tch and ensuing macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty underscored the importance 
o f sustained dialogue to discuss re fo rm options and articulate linkages. Government ownership was 
achieved through a sustained dialogue, supported b y good ana ly t ica l work, plus time. This implies a 
s ign i f ican t amount o f wo rk in the field. The question o f t ime frame i s also essential. W h i l e the 
Government acts qu ick ly when there i s strong commitment, capacity constraints continue to hinder 
effectiveness. 

’ 

Understanding and building on drivers of change have proven important in f ind ing critical levers 
of reform. The Government’s strong comm i tmen t t o the N T 2 pro jec t has been a very impor tan t dr iver 
o f change over the last tw o years that has successfully leveraged re forms in other c r i t ica l areas (Box 
4). The W o r l d Bank ’s par t ic ipa t ion in supporting the Government has built trust and opened the door 
to dialogue in a number o f new areas. Other opportunities and dr ivers o f change that the W o r l d Bank 
should continue to support include: the Government’s g row ing appreciation of, and comm i tmen t to, 
g loba l and reg iona l opportunities, inc lud ing i t s desire t o j o i n W T O ; the g row th o f reg iona l markets 
and investments; 
L a o PDR’s interest in keeping up w i t h i t s fas t-grow ing neighbors; 
the 
Government’s comm i tmen t to reg iona l cooperation in the M R C and G M S programs; and 
the 
Government’s desire to graduate f r om the ranks o f LDCs b y 2020 and cu t pover ty in h a l f as ou t l ined 
in i t s NGPES. 

Given capacity constraints, capacity development activities should be undertaken using a 
comprehensive approach that links capacity to development results. While capacity building 
objectives were articulated in past projects supported b y the W o r l d Bank, the l i n k s between capacity 
and development results were unclear. Baselines were rare ly iden t i f ied , mak ing i t d i f f icu l t to measure 
resu l ts . Capacity development needs to be de f ined in terms o f the achievement o f specific, 
measurable results w i t h rea l is t ic indicators, timeframes, and baselines defined. This approach should 
be b o t h opportunistic - - a imed at achieving short-term results, and strategic, gradually addressing 
structural weaknesses that can on ly be overcome over the l o n g t e rm . Government and donor 
resources should be aligned w i t h these desired outcomes. This requires a sound understanding o f 
incen t ive and governance structures and how these translate i n t o po l ic ies , programs, and activities. I t 
also means that capacity building objectives must be embedded in na t iona l and sectoral strategic 
frameworks and in terven t ions at multiple levels-reforms 
o f organ iza t iona l processes and incen t ive 
systems, strengthening o f ins t i tu t ions , and ind iv idua l s k i l l transfer. A t ten t ion should also be pa id to

some o f the ma jo r i s s u e s fac ing bo th the country and project performance. Third, strong f i e l d fo l low - 
up on po r t fo l io i s s u e s and performance, inc lud ing quarterly reviews w i t h the Government, gradually 
strengthened the capacity to deal w i t h implementation i s s u e s on a da i ly basis. Fourth, as the 
Government became more aware o f the po r t fo l io issues , there was an improvemen t in i t s efforts to 
mon i to r donor por t fo l ios (a l though this s t i l l remains weak). W h i l e i t i s impor tan t to continue 
ana ly t ica l w o r k and strong co l labora t ion on performance, the focus should n o w broaden to include 
outcomes, as w e l l as mak ing sure that the W o r l d Bank’s program (po r t fo l io and ana ly t ica l work) i s as

Adopting these lessons in the World Bank’s new CAS will mean building on recent successes 
and changing the way the World Bank does business in Lao PDR. Espec ia l ly impor tan t to ensuring the 

relevance o f the W o r l d Bank’s strategy and po r t fo l io w i l l be building relationships w i t h the senior 
government leadership to better understand development pr ior i t ies and in terna l dynamics. W o r l d Bank 
AAA and dialogue should be sustained and focused on na t iona lhec tor strategies in order to build 
agreement on and comm i tmen t t o key re fo rm pr ior i t ies . Instruments w i l l be integrated to fac i l i ta te key 
development results, using strategies that link po l icy re forms w i t h investments and appropriate 
mechanisms fo r capacity building. The W o r l d Bank w i l l need to ma in ta in emphasis on commun ica t ion 
and coord ina t ion w i t h development partners, wo rk ing towards shared strategies, sector w ide approaches 
(SWAPS) , and harmon iza t ion (see B o x 5 fo r one example o f a success story). 

Box 5: T h e R o a d Ma in tenance P rog r am - A Success Story 

Reorienting Strategic Approach. T h e approval o f the Road Maintenance Program (RMP), an eight-year Adaptable 
Program Loan, marked a major shift i n focus from donor-driven investment to one o f harmonized preservation and 
sustainable management o f road assets. Changing how donors engaged in the road sector, particularly the shift toward a 
maintenance “culture,” took several years o f active dialogue and analytical work. The program i s now being successfully 
implemented by the Ministry o f Communications, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) and supports the 
development and implementation o f financing and road management systems; capacity development o f public and 
private road transport and infrastructure services; and the decentralization o f management to provincial and district 
levels. 
Harmonization of Partnerships. T h e active cooperation o f the main donors involved in the sector, mainly Sweden, 
ADB, the Nordic Investment Fund and the Bank, was instrumental for the success o f the project. A l l rallied behind the 
MCTPC motto, “One Country - One System,” supporting the development o f harmonized systems in financial 
management, procurement, reporting and monitoring. 
Capacity Building. As part o f the RMP, all implementation functions for donor-financed projects in the road sector were 
intemalized within MCTPC’s existing s truc tures and a l l ad hoc Project Implementation Units (PIU) were dismantled. T h e 
second phase o f the RMP w i l l implement a comprehensive Human Resource strategy to institutionalize s k i l l s and

processes that are linked to project outcomes.

handled efficiently. MCTPC management demonstrates flexibility in implementation yet remains focused o n the 
development objectives. 

l6 T h e implementation progress o f the Sustainable Forestry for Rural Development Project was rated unsatisfactory in December 
2004. T h e project i s expected to return to satisfactory status once the Govemment addresses some staffing i s s u e s affecting project

I V . WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. 

SELECT IV ITY AND APPROACH 

51. 
Se lect iv ity . The C A S has been designed to support the NGPES and w i t h i n this framework, to 
support key areas o f fu ture g row th and improved social outcomesheductions in vu lnerab i l i ty . The W o r l d 
Bank ’s AAA p rog ram w i l l p rov ide comprehensive but selective support in these tw o areas based on 
lessons learned during the last C A S period, new momen tum and strong government ownership o f the 
NGPES, g row ing cooperation among donors, and enhanced dialogue between the Government and the 
W o r l d Bank in recent years. Greater selectivity w i l l be achieved b y mov ing to a AAA cyc le approach in 
wh ich studies are chosen as par t o f a process leading to more specific advisory wo rk and lend ing 
operations. There w i l l also be some areas c r i t ica l to the successful achievement o f CAS objectives where 
the W o r l d Bank w i l l no t be tak ing a leading ro le ( fo r example, decentralization po l icy and c i v i l service 
re form) but w i l l be wo rk ing closely w i t h other development partners through the Dono r Wo rk ing Group 
process, and p rov id ing AAA support in close coord ina t ion w i t h these other partners. 

52. 
In targe t ing l im i t e d IDA resources on p r io r i ty areas fo r W o r l d B a n k assistance, activities w i l l 
focus on areas where: 

A strong d r ive r of change exists (such as NT2 , government app l ica t ion to j o i n WTO , achieving 
ASEAN and AFTA commitments, etc.) to p rov ide an opening fo r dialogue, ana ly t ica l work, and 
support to the Government to explore impor tan t re fo rm options and build ownership and comm i tmen t 
to a pa th o f re forms ; 

The W o r l d Bank has a demonstrated track record and /or comparative advantage in g loba l know ledge 

and experience that can build confidence and create demand f o r further change; 

There i s su f f ic ien t government commitment to reforms; and an ins t i tu t iona l entry po in t exists, w i t h 

po ten t ia l fo r overcom ing capacity constraints that w i l l s ign i f ican t ly a f fec t development outcomes; 
and. 

e 

Jo in t donor resources can be e f fec t ive ly leveraged and b y wo rk ing together each donor can 
contribute according to i t s comparative advantage. 

53 . 
M a n y impor tan t areas w i l l no t be supported b y the W o r l d Bank during this CAS pe r iod due to 
l im i ted IDA resources, lack o f government readiness to take action, and/or other strong donor 
invo lvemen t and comparative advantage, etc. This includes U X O remova l where other donors have a 
comparative advantage. I t also includes lega l and j u d i c i a l r e f o rm and development o f tou r ism where other 
donors a n d o r the p r iva te sector are curren t ly work ing , and large investments in transport infrastructure 
because o f the l im i ted ava i lab i l i ty o f IDA resources. 

54. 
Approach. The W o r l d Bank w i l l recalibrate i t s approach du r ing this C A S pe r iod to incorporate a 
more exp l ic i t emphasis on building capacity. Capacity development i s a cen tra l element o f the CAS 
approach and each element o f the C A S w i l l address i t in support o f the Government’s imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the NGPES. Weaknesses in organizational processes and incen t ive systems as w e l l as in the capacities o f 
specific institutions and in the breadth o f ind iv idua l s k i l l s a l l severely impede b o t h the pub l ic and pr iva te 
sector in pe r fo rm ing key func t ions e f fec t ive ly . W o r l d Bank assistance w i l l focus w i t h i n each C A S 
objective on supporting the iden t i f ica t ion , pr ior i t iza t ion , and remova l o f key capacity constraints-that 
are v i ta l fo r achieving pover ty reduc t ion and economic and social goals. 

- 21 - 

55 . 

The CAS w i l l also incorporate a stronger, applied e f fo r t to build partnerships w i t h a l l 
stakeholders, and especially develop consensus among donors and the Govemment in c r i t ica l re fo rm 
areas. The approach w i l l be implemented through invo lvemen t in the new ly fo rmed Dono r Wo rk ing 
Groups and ensuring as much as possible that AAA and lend ing activities are carr ied out in partnership 
w i t h government o f f ic ia ls , loca l academics, c i v i l society, and donors. F ina l ly , the CAS w i l l focus 
par t icu lar attention on the implementation o f N T 2 as a p r ime example bo th o f the focus on sustaining 
grow th , imp rov ing social outcomes and reducing vu lne rab i l i ty and the emphasis o n capacity building and 
partnerships.

Strengthen public financial management capacities. Together w i t h the ADB and the IMF, the 
W o r l d Bank has supported government e f for ts to develop a comprehensive Pub l ic Expend i ture 
Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP), inc lud ing a capacity bu i ld ing component that outlines 
p r i o r i t y government goals and provides a framework fo r coordinating donor assistance. Within this 
framework , W o r l d Bank assistance w i l l focus on strengthening the core pub l ic expenditure management 
systems, complementing ADB assistance concentrating on audit and accounting systems, strengthening 
the State Audit O f f ice , and UNDP assistance (w i t h support f r om Sweden, Sw i tzer land and the EU) on 
p rov inc ia l f inanc ia l management. W o r l d Bank support w i l l be prov ided through the PRSCs, the ongoing 
FMC BC , the proposed fo l low -up Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management TA operation, and a series o f Public 
Expend i ture Reviews (w i th possible support f r om Sweden) and Pub l ic Expend i ture T rack ing Surveys 
(PETS) (w i t h support f r om the EU) as w e l l as through support fo r sectoral expenditure management. 

Improve p red ic tab i l i ty and NGPES alignment of expenditure allocations. W o r l d Bank assistance 

w i l l support expenditure planning, fac i l i ta t ing a gradual shift in resources to NGPES pr ior i t ies , 
together w i t h a streamlined budget preparation process. D u r i n g the CAS period, the p ropo r t ion o f 
the na t iona l budget devoted to hea l th and education, and the share o f recurrent expenditures, and 
expenditures on p r ima ry services, are expected to increase in l i n e w i t h NGPES objectives. The 
W o r l d Bank w i l l also support ana ly t ica l wo rk to prov ide a basis fo r a coherent, long - te rm c i v i l 
service pay re fo rm po l icy . A t ten t ion w i l l focus in i t ia l ly on the development o f an expenditure 
framework in tegra t ing pay p o l i c y options. A longs ide W o r l d Bank support to the M i n i s t r y o f 
Finance (MOF ) through AAA w o r k and the PRSCs, W o r l d Bank projects in key NGPES sectors 
( fo r example, education and health), w i l l support improvements 
in public expenditure 
management at agency leve l . 

Improve expenditure compliance, p red ic tab i l i ty and 

transparency. Po l icy and capacity 
interventions w i l l support strengthening o f the cash management, budgeting, and procurement 
systems, conso l ida t ion o f treasury functions, and improved f inanc ia l repor t ing and compliance, 
inc lud ing p rov inc ia l revenue and expenditure mechanisms, inter-governmental f isca l transfers, 
and more t ime ly payment o f c i v i l servants. In support o f increased f inanc ia l transparency, the 
W o r l d Bank w i l l support government e f for ts to publish detailed budgets, execution reports, 
f inanc ia l statements, and aud i t reports. This w i l l en ta i l investments in the de f in i t ion o f 
appropriate standards, supporting in fo rma t ion systems and the tra in ing o f f inanc ia l management 
personnel. This support to be p rov ided through AAA and the PRSCs w i l l be complemented b y an 
ADB-funded bank ing sector r e f o rm p rog ram and a tax pro jec t funded by Sweden. 

Reduce losses f rom state-owned banks and SOEs. Assistance fo r state-owned banks and

Strengthen analysis and the capacity fo r social and cu l tu ra l research. Assessments on 

vu lne rab i l i ty o f up land communities, inc lud ing the impacts o f stabilization, relocation, and 
reg iona l in tegra t ion po l ic ies and programs w i l l be conducted j o i n t l y w i t h the Government, M B O s 
and other donors inc lud ing Sweden, EU, and UN agencies. These assessments, along w i t h the 
Ru ra l Sector Strategy, w i l l contribute to dialogue on v iab le alternative approaches, inc lud ing in 
situ development to improve loca l l ive l ihoods and reduce vu lnerab i l i ty . The L a n d Titling project,

develop and effectively implement sound sector strategies and programs . The W o r l d Bank has 

already had considerable success in this respect in L a o PDR, pa r t icu la r ly in the infrastructure 
sector. Go ing forward , the W o r l d Bank intends t o build on the progress already made on road 
management and f inanc ing (w i t h the MCTPC ) and on energy (w i t h the MIH and EdL). In 
addition, the W o r l d Bank w i l l focus par t icu lar attention on capacity building w i t h respect to 
env ironmen ta l and social safeguards (bu i ld ing on the N T 2 experience and spreading i t to other 
regions); strengthening the capacity o f research ins t i tu t ions to mon i to r social impacts; and 
strengthening the capacity o f the M in is t ry o f Educa t ion to target resources to reach vulnerable 
groups and to mon i to r education outcomes and t o use mon i to r ing in fo rma t ion to i n f o rm p o l i c y 
decisions. 

e Strengthen capacities of loca l t ra in ing institutions to support capacity development activities. The 

W o r l d Bank w i l l support e f for ts to incorporate new capacity building content and me thodo logy in 
key L a o PDR t ra in ing institutions, including the Na t iona l Organ iza t ion fo r the Study o f Po l icy 
and Adm in is t ra t ion (NOSPA)19 - - the Government’s p r ima ry t ra in ing school fo r c i v i l servants. 
The W o r l d Bank i s assessing the poss ib i l i ty o f p rov id ing more support to build NOSPA 
capacities in results-based management and NGPES imp lemen ta t ion . Tools to be employed 
inc lude ins t i tu t iona l tw inn ing and other partnership arrangements between senior L a o P D R 
government o f f ic ia ls , their ins t i tu t ions and counterparts in ne ighbor ing countries (especially 
Ch ina and the H o C h i Minh Academy in Vietnam). Partnerships w i t h ins t i tu t ions f r om Ko rea and 
Aus tra l ia are also foreseen. Support i s also be ing p rov ided t o strengthen in-service and pre- 
service tra in ing ins t i tu t ions in hea l th and education.

Consult and build partnerships with and help enhance the capacity of the private sector, civil 
society and communities. B o t h the NGPES process and the process fo r prepar ing this CAS have invo lved 
a strong leve l o f consultation w i t h and par t ic ipa t ion o f the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society and the pub l ic at

and pa r t ic ipa t ion and further strengthen contacts w i t h these important groups o f stakeholders and, where 
feasible, help enhance their capacity and effectiveness. 

e Strengthen partnerships w i t h the p r iva te sector. Through the diagnostic trade in tegra t ion study 
and the investment c l ima te survey, the W o r l d Bank w i l l be wo rk ing w i t h the Government and 
other donors to better understand the constraints t o pr iva te sector development and to help put in 
place the po l ic ies and programs needed to address those constraints. In under tak ing these studies, 
the W o r l d Bank w i l l be wo rk ing c lose ly w i t h the L a o Business F o r um and complementing the 
d irec t capacity building support to be p rov ided to the Fo rum and to sma l l businesses in L a o PDR 
b y I F C M P D F . The W o r l d Bank as w e l l as I F C and MIGA w i l l also be wo rk ing d i rec t ly w i t h the 
fo re ign and domestic pr iva te sectors on investment projects o f importance to the country, bu i ld ing 
on the very success fu l N T 2 pro jec t example. 

e Consult w i t h c iv i l society and mass-based organizations (MBOs). The W o r l d Bank w i l l expand 

communications w i t h and outreach to c i v i l society - b o t h the in terna t iona l NGOs based in L a o 
PDR as w e l l as the loca l organizations that are beg inn ing to be established - as w e l l as the loca l 
and fo re ign media. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also strengthen partnerships w i t h organizations such as 
the L a o Women’s U n i o n and the L a o F ron t fo r Na t iona l Construction that have c r i t ica l roles to 
p lay in b r ing ing the voices o f their constituencies in to the development and imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
na t iona l economic and social r e f o rm agenda. 

e Work w i t h communities. The W o r l d Bank w i l l continue to wo rk d i rec t ly w i t h communities 
through the PRF and other ongo ing operations to build capacity to plan, p r io r i t ize and manage 
commun i ty investments. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also build commun i ty invo lvemen t d irec t ly in to 
fu ture operations, par t icu lar ly in areas o f na tura l resources management and the social sectors. 
Special emphasis w i l l be placed on building the capacity o f women to par t ic ipa te f u l l y in 
p lann ing and decision making, and more generally in hav ing the s k i l l s needed to participate in a 
market economy. 

69 . 
Strengthen donor partnerships for better results. A l though IDA resources allocated to L a o PDR 
are sma l l re la t ive to the size o f ove ra l l donor support, the W o r l d Bank remains a lead agency in 
supporting L a o PDR ’s development objectives, and in particular, i t s po l icy agenda. The W o r l d Bank w i l l 
fur ther enhance this ro le du r ing the nex t C A S pe r iod through i t s lend ing and ana ly t ica l program b y 
ac t ive ly supporting the Government’s a id coord ina t ion e f for ts through the Round Tab le process and the 
Dono r W o r k i n g Groups and b y seeking co - f inanc ing and para l le l f inanc ing opportunities (Box 6). 

e Support government and donor efforts to develop and refine shared strategic frameworks in key 
sectors and bu i ld agreement on p r i o r i t y po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l reform as a basis f o r more effective 

donor coord ina t ion . The W o r l d Bank w i l l continue to wo rk w i t h the Government, the UNDP and 
other donors to improve the Government’s ove ra l l capacity fo r a id coord ina t ion and the effectiveness 
o f donor support. During 2003, the Government organized a successful series o f thematic Round 
Tab le Meetings under the PRSPNGPES process. F o l l ow i n g on this, in M a r c h 2004, donors agreed to 
establish a new donor coord ina t ion mechanism to support the NGPES. This mechan ism consists o f 
e igh t in fo rma l sectorauthematic Dono r W o r k i n g Groups consisting o f b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l 
donors and N G O representatives and inc lude ac t ive government par t ic ipa t ion . The groups inc lude : 
macroeconomic and pr iva te sector development; governance; education and gender; hea l th and 
H I V / A I D S ; infrastructure; ru ra l development; env i ronmen tha tu ra l resource management; and drug 
prevention. The objectives o f the groups are to : (i) fur ther po l icy dialogue w i t h the Government on a 
broad range o f sector development issues; (ii) support the respective sectors in the development o r 
strengthening o f sector strategies agreed b y a l l stakeholders; (iii) strengthen dialogue and in fo rma t ion 

- 33 - 

sharing among donors w i t h regard to sector-relevant key issues as w e l l as ongo ing and planned 
projects and programs; and ( iv ) promote s imp l i f ica t ion and harmon iza t ion among donor procedures in 
order to l ow e r the transactions costs and burden o f the rec ip ien t country. These groups are n ow 
mee t ing regu lar ly and are hav ing a pos i t ive impact, inc lud ing in the development o f a Donors’ M a t r i x 
as an immed ia te too l fo r the Government and donors to imp rove coord ina t ion and cooperation 
(Attachment 4). A w ide ly attended Harmon iza t ion Workshop he ld in February 2005 has also taken 
pos i t ive steps towards agreeing on the establishment o f a Harmon iza t ion Ac t ion Plan. 

Box 6: M a j o r D o n o r Activities 

A D B . ADB i s developing i t s assistance program for the coming years, aligning i t with the NGPES priorities. ADB activities have 
emphasized rural development and market linkages; human resource development; environmental management; and private 
sector development. T h e Bank and ADB are working closely together on the NT2 project and more broadly on strengthening 
environmental management and social safeguards in the energy sector. T h e Bank intends to continue close collaboration with 
ADB in the areas o f support to the Government’s public expenditure management, banking sector reform, health sector, rural 
electrification, and SOE reform. 
Austra l ia . Australia’s development cooperation with Lao PDR i s framed by a new country strategy that focuses on access to 
education, property rights in the transition to a market economy and reducing the vulnerability o f poorer communities to natural 
disasters. Current key programs include support to the health sector, ASEAN cooperation, prevention o f human trafficking, and 
integration in to WTO. Australia and the Bank are co-financing the second Land T i t l ing project to foster the development o f 
efficient land markets. 
E u r o p e a n U n i o n . Aligned with the NGPES, the EU has focused i t s assistance to Lao PDR on rural poverty reduction. Other 
main areas o f cooperation include health care, institutional support, education and the environment (forest conservation). Good 
governance i s a key element o f EU support, in particular through i t s support to the legal sector and public administration system. 
T h e Bank w i l l work closely w i th the E U in co-financing PRSC 2 and support to the public expenditure management reform 
process. 
F rance . France i s primarily supporting electrification network improvements in Vientiane, a capitalization program for assistance 
to rural development policy implementation, and basic education. In addition to working closely together on and co-financing the 
NT2 project, i t i s expected that the Bank and AFD w i l l continue to collaborate closely and agree on co-financing support for rural 
development and public expenditure management capacity building. 
IMF. T h e Bank collaborates closely and regularly with the I M F on macroeconomic developments, the f isca l framework and 
public sector reforms, the financial sector, investment regimes, and poverty. T h e two institutions co-chair the Donor Working 
Group fo r Macroeconomics and Private Sector Development and produced the JSAN for the NGPES in November 2004. Lao 
PDR w i l l be under the Fund’s Surveillance when the current PRGF program ends in Ap r i l 2005. 
Japan. Through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) grant facility, Japan provides significant support fo r 
improvement o f transportation infrastructure; strengthening o f the primary and higher education system; public health, especially 
through support for medical technology; human resource development; and the legal sector and public investment plan 
management. 
Sweden. Sweden provides key support for strengthening o f the legal sector, the public administration reform process and the 
promotion o f human rights. In alignment with the NGPES, other focus areas include support for education, rehabilitation o f 
national roads and strengthening o f the national statistical system. T h e Bank and Sweden are jo in t ly promoting sustainable 
preservation o f the national road network by developing, implementing and co-financing the Road Maintenance Fund facility. 
T h e Bank w i l l continue to work closely with Sweden to support a more coherent statistical system and improved governance. 
U n i t e d Nat ions . UNDP supports the Government in aid coordination efforts and, w i th other UN agencies, provides assistance to 
key capacity and institutional building efforts. T h e UN system i s helping the Government develop and monitor Lao MDGs. T h e 
UN agencies also provide support in governance and strengthening o f the legal sector, prevention o f drug production, UXO 
operations, health management, H IV IA IDS prevention and primary education in remote areas. As an active member o f the UN 
Country Team, the Bank works closely with the UN agencies in aid coordination, alignment o f support w i th the NGPES and 
MDGs and on various aspects of the governance reform program. T h e Bank also works with the UN Coordinator and UNDP 
Representative, in particular in aid coordination and major donor-government consultations, governance and financial 
management. 

0 Ensure that the implementation of 
the Bank’s assistance strategy is closely aligned w i th other 
major donors in Lao PDR (most notably Japan, ADB and the UN system). B u i l d i n g o n the 
example o f the NT2 project, w h i c h has been a mode l o f cooperation and coord ina t ion among f i v e 
d i f feren t donors (ADB, AFD, the European Investment Bank (ED), the No rd ic Investment Bank 
(N IB ) , and the W o r l d Bank Group), the W o r l d Bank w i l l be endeavoring t o leverage the 

- 34 - 

re la t ive ly modest resources available to i t fo r analytic wo rk and lend ing b y wo rk ing much more 
c lose ly w i t h other donors. This w i l l invo lve do ing much more o f the AAA w o r k jo in t ly , as i s 
happening curren t ly fo r the integrated trade wo rk (wh ich invo lves the IMF, WTO , and U N C T A D 
as w e l l as donors under the overa l l coord ina t ion o f AusAid) and the investment c l ima te 
assessment wo rk wh ich i s be ing led b y ADB w i t h support f r o m the W o r l d Bank . With respect to 
p o l i c y based lending, a number o f donors are already invo lved j o i n t l y w i t h the W o r l d Bank in the 
po l icy d ia logue and have indicated their in te res t in co- f inanc ing fu ture PRSCs. And in the case o f 
investment lending, the W o r l d Bank w i l l be encouraging the Government and other donors to 
move as qu ick ly as possible to SWAps to their imp lemen ta t ion support in the context o f agreed 
and government-owned sector strategies and programs. As par t o f these SWAps, the W o r l d Bank 
w i l l be supporting harmon iza t ion of pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion processes, as appropriate. These 
e f for ts w i l l require active W o r l d Bank invo lvemen t in and support fo r the Round Table process 
and the sectorallthematic Dono r Wo rk ing Groups at the coun try leve l as w e l l as engagement w i t h 
the headquarters o f spec i f ic donors, as i s already happening, par t icu lar ly in the case o f Japan and 
the ADB.

71. 
The preparation of the pro jec t has expanded and strengthened the dialogue between L a o PDR and 
the development commun i ty on a w ide range o f development issues and has served as a catalyst fo r 
fo rmu la t ion o f the NGPES and progress on a range o f development issues. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
N T 2 pro jec t w i l l con tr ibu te to the attainment o f a l l o f the prev ious three C A S objectives (Table 7 ) . I t w i l l 
contribute to sustained economic g row th through fur ther reg iona l in tegra t ion and more sustainable na tu ra l 
resource management. I t w i l l develop government capacity in pub l ic f inanc ia l management to ensure that 
revenues w i l l be targeted in areas that w i l l imp rove soc ia l outcomes. I t w i l l strengthen central, p rov inc ia l , 
and d is tr ic t management capacities in managing large in fras truc ture investments, u t i l i z i n g par t ic ipa tory 
approaches, and mon i to r ing and build stronger partnerships among a l l concerned stakeholders. The 
pro jec t does, however, en ta i l development risks that need care fu l management. I t also poses repu ta t iona l 
risk fo r the W o r l d Bank, g iven the expectations i t has raised as be ing a mode l f o r sustainable 
development. T o ensure close co l labora t ion du r ing imp lemen ta t ion among the f i v e d i f feren t donors 
supporting the project, the donors have agreed on a se t o f Partnership Pr inc ip les to guide the ir

NT2 mechanisms are in place to ensure that expected revenues contribute to increases in 
spending on priority poverty reduction and environmental protection programs, and ultimately to 
strengthened service delivery and improved social outcomes (CAS Objective 2 ) . The Government’s 

PEMSP w i l l put in place the key instruments fo r ensuring that N T 2 revenues are transparently allocated in 
l ine w i t h objectives l a i d out in the N T 2 Dec is ion Framework over the longer te rm (Box 4). The 
Government has agreed to specific N T 2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements to be app l ied 
f r om the t ime o f pro jec t comm iss ion ing (curren t ly estimated as 2009), that w i l l prov ide add i t iona l 
assurance that revenues specific to N T 2 are app l ied transparently in f inanc ing add i t iona l spending on 
pover ty reduc t ion and environmental programs. 

0 Revenue and expenditure management arrangements w i l l be pu t in p lace to ensure transparent,

The World Bank will take an integrated approach in its country assistance program in L a o 
PDR by combining various instruments to effectively support the CAS Objectives based on client 

priorities and lessons learned. W o r l d Bank support du r ing the CAS pe r iod w i l l inc lude a m ix tu re o f 
programmatic and investment lend ing and an impor tan t program o f ana ly t ica l and advisory services. In an 
e f for t to max im ize l im i t e d IDA resources, strategic and par t ic ipa tory economic sector wo rk and technical 
assistance w i l l be complemented b y a series o f PRSCs to support cross-sectoral p o l i c y reforms. G iven 
L a o PDR’s l o w income and considerable debt burden, the ma jo r i ty o f IDA resources w i l l most l i k e l y be 
p rov ided as grants. These resource flows, along w i t h those f r om other donors and in terna t iona l f inanc ia l 
ins t i tu t ions , w i l l help to fill the coun try ’s external f inanc ing gaps, wh ich are pro jec ted to continue in the 
medium to longer term, as w e l l as help finance p r io r i ty investments and expenditures. 

76. 
AAA w i l l provide the analytical underpinnings for policy dialogue, the development of jo int 
government and donor frameworks, the design of the lending program and technical support, and the 
basis for implementing the CAS Objectives. The AAA p rog ram w i l l be c lose ly l inked t o the CAS 

Objectives to ensure a coherent and prac t ica l set o f instruments t o promo te know ledge and build

development partners throughout the AAA cyc le w i l l be instrumental in building capacity and ownership. 
D iagnos t ic wo rk w i l l be undertaken co l labora t ive ly w i t h government counterparts, donors, and loca l 
researchers to build capacity and consensus around key po l icy outcomes. The East As ia and Pac i f ic

A key instrument of the Bank’s assistance w i l l be a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits 

(PRSCs). As a core Bank instrument, the PRSCs w i l l enable sustained dialogue, coord ina t ion and 
progress on key elements o f the Government’s re fo rm agenda.20 The Government has n ow adopted an 
impor tan t Public Expend i ture Management Support Program, wh ich has been developed over the last 
several years in close consu l ta t ion w i t h the W o r l d Bank, the IMF, and the ADB, among others. The 
PRSCs w i l l support ins t i tu t iona l incentives that imp rove organ iza t iona l capacities, par t icu lar ly in pub l ic

expenditure management and SOE reform, as well as i n new areas such as service delivery, the enabling environment fo r regional 
integration, and private sector development. Although CPIA ratings score low in a number o f areas important for policy-based 
lending, Lao PDR’s outcome performance measures (consistent growth and poverty reduction performance) have been strong.

PRSCs w i l l be implemented annually during th is CAS pe r iod (although the components o f a PRSC-4 
have yet to be discussed and agreed upon), supporting a programmatic series o f actions based on three 
p i l la rs : the f irs t , addressing key reforms scheduled under the Government’s PEMSP; the second, 
addressing sector reforms aimed at shifting resources in support o f basic social services and 
improvements in service de l ivery management at the sector leve l ; and third, enhancing the environment

PRSCs w i l l focus on critical public sector reforms to strengthen accountability and efficiency 
of public expenditure management, and improve allocation of public resources to pro-poor

the L a o PDR portfolio. As o f January 31, 2005, IDA credits to ta l ing 

87. 
US$723 m i l l i o n equivalent have been approved fo r L a o PDR w i t h US$586 m i l l i o n disbursed, o f wh ich 
US$37 m i l l i o n has been repaid. These credits have supported development projects in various sectors 
such as ru ra l development, agriculture, forestry, transport, energy, education, health, land re form , 
f inanc ia l management, capacity building, and po l icy reforms. The current po r t fo l io includes nine active 
credits amounting to US$153.6 m i l l i o n o f wh ich US$122 m i l l i o n i s undisbursed. The fac t that h a l f o f the 
po r t fo l io has been replaced b y new pro jec ts in the last 12 months explains the sma l l disbursed amount. 
Exc lud ing the L a n d T i t l i n g pro jec t wh ich w i l l close nex t September, the average active l i f e o f the 
rema in ing e igh t projects i s on ly 22 months. Curren t ly there i s on ly one p rob lem pro jec t . Imp lemen ta t ion 
progress o f the Sustainable Fores try fo r Ru ra l Deve lopmen t Project was rated unsatisfactory in December 
2004. The pro jec t i s expected to return t o satisfactory status once the Government addresses some s ta f f ing 
i s s u e s a f fec t ing project management. The sustainability ra t ing o f W o r l d Bank- f inanced operations in L a o 
PDR has been satisfactory: a rev iew o f the last 14 ICRs shows that 11 projects (80 percent o f the 
po r t fo l io ) were rated l i k e l y o r better in terms o f sustainability. Moreover , the performance o f the borrower 
has been rated satisfactory o r better o n a l l but one pro jec t , show ing a strong comm i tmen t f r o m the 
Government. 

88 . 
The current portfolio is w e l l aligned with the CAS with most projects simultaneously 
supporting several of 
the objectives, especially ru ra l development. The po r t fo l io also includes 17 

grantsz2 (PHRD, JSDF, GEF, IDF) amoun t ing to US$17 m i l l i o n in support o f increased empowerment o f 
ru ra l communities in uplands areas, e f f ic ien t procurement systems, imp roved f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty in 
SOEs and the pr iva te sector, and various capacity building and pro jec t preparation ac t iv i t ies . 

89 . 

Although implementation and disbursement have been satisfactory over the last four years, 

improvements are still required. A series o f measures i s be ing undertaken to address i s s u e s at the coun try 
and pro jec t levels re la t ing to imp lemen ta t ion readiness, capacity bu i ld ing , f inanc ia l management, 
auditing, imp lemen ta t ion arrangements, and pro jec t p lann ing , mon i to r ing and evaluation. The CFAA and 
CPAR iden t i f ied a series o f actions t o strengthen the capacity o f the Government to manage pub l ic 
expenditures and procurement. Results are already evident in procurement, as evidenced b y the 
endorsement o f an e f fec t ive procurement decree and accompanying ru les and regulations, preparation o f 

22 F i v e grants to ta l ing US$10.2 m i l l i o n are pend ing effectiveness as o f February 21,2005.

The Wor ld Bank w i l l also give priority to improving the quality of 

the portfolio under 

supervision. A t the pro jec t leve l , the W o r l d Bank and the Government w i l l incorporate lessons learned 
f rom in-depth f iduc ia ry rev iews recently carried out on the W o r l d Bank- f inanced po r t fo l io in several

agreements: (i) iden t i f ica t ion o f specific anti-corruption measures as par t o f the pro jec t readiness cr i ter ia 
f i l te r ; (ii) strengthening o f procurement and f inanc ia l management mechanisms in project design and 
implementation; (iii) imp rov ing disclosure mechanisms; ( iv ) greater invo lvemen t o f beneficiaries in

and (v i) systematic fo l low -up on cases o f non-compliance, in teg r i ty issues and audit findings, along w i t h 
appropriate remed ia l measures. The W o r l d Bank also w i l l emphasize capacity development activities in 
mon i to r ing the po r t fo l io . As appropriate, existing projects w i l l b e restructured to ma tch closely capacity

SCENAR IOS AND TRIGGERS 

9 1. 
The base-case IDA allocation, which is annually determined by the performance-based 
allocation system, currently provides an indicative allocation of US$128 millionz3 over the four year 

period of the CAS.24 The Performance-based A l loca t ion (PBA) system that allocates IDA resources 
among countries each year i s strongly linked to coun try performance as measured b y the CP IA ra t ings - 
w i t h strong weights attached to governance - as w e l l as W o r l d Bank po r t fo l io performance. This system 
further underscores the importance o f max im iz ing results and impact, especially f o r a country l i k e L a o 
PDR where available IDA resources are l im i ted and are curren t ly lowe r than during the last CAS . L a o 
PDR ’s performance in some key C P I A categories has been lagg ing in recent years, but w i t h the renewed 
impetus fo r re forms and recent measures (par t icu lar ly in areas such as pub l ic f inanc ia l management, f isca l 
transparency and accountability) i t i s possible that performance ra t ings cou ld imp rove and thus generate 
higher IDA allocations during the years covered b y this CAS . G iven L a o PDR ’s l o w income and h i g h 
debt burden, i t i s expected that a s ign i f ican t po r t ion o f IDA resources w i l l be available as grants. 

92 . 

A framework for assessing government performance and the adequacy of 

the policy 

environment has been developed. I t focuses around key re forms in fou r areas: economic growth, pub l ic 
resource management po l icy (including government obligations under NT2 ) , pover ty reduction, and 
po r t fo l io performance. The Government has begun reforms in each o f these areas and ma in ta in ing 
momen tum i s impor tan t in the base case. A number o f indicators, presented in Tab le 10, w i l l be used to 
make a judgmen t about the overa l l leve l o f performance and adequacy o f the po l icy environment fo r base 
and h i g h case scenarios. 

23 Th is includes a one-time a l loca t ion f o r the NT2 p rog ram in FY05. 
24 I D A - 1 4 ru les fo r IDA allocations are l i k e l y t o change f r om the I D A - 1 3 rules; however these ru les are n o t

Low case and high case lending scenarios w i l l respond to client performance and the pace of 
reforms and implementation. A l o w case lending scenario, wh ich wou ld be characterized b y a weak 
macroeconomic stance, slow pace or serious back track ing on the re fo rm agenda and imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the pover ty reduc t ion strategy, or a poo r ly pe r fo rm ing po r t fo l io that s ign i f ican t ly reduces L a o PDR’ s 
score on the PBA, w i l l p rov ide about US$40-80 m i l l i o n over FY05-FY08 and fund d irec t ly-pover ty-

inc lud ing the op t ion of no t engaging in fu ture f inanc ing and/or suspension o f the entire po r t fo l io , until i t 
i s satisfied that agreements are be ing me t and there i s adherence to commitments. I f the pace o f reforms 
and imp lemen ta t ion greatly accelerate and s ign i f ican t additional key po l icy changes are undertaken, i t 
w o u l d be expected that the P B A exercise cou ld push L a o PDR in to a h i g h case lend ing scenario o f about 
30 percent more IDA a l loca t ion than the base case. These add i t iona l resources wou ld be prov ided ma in ly

regu la tory reforms, f inanc ia l sector liberalization, the SOE restructuring program, o r through one or two 
add i t iona l investment operations. 

F. MONITORING CAS IMPLEMENTATION 

94 . 
The implementation of 
the results-based CAS w i l l be monitored and evaluated at frequent 
intervals to enhance effectiveness, determine accountability, and provide feedback for modifcations 

and corrections. The M&E w i l l b e undertaken in a par t ic ipa tory manner in consultation w i t h the 
Government and other stakeholders. These w i l l inc lude annual CAS M&E retreats w i t h the W o r l d Bank‘s 
L a o PDR Coun try Team and key stakeholder representatives inc lud ing the Government, donors, NGOs, 
and other members o f c i v i l society. Independent evaluators may be commissioned to prepare the 
background ma ter ia l and i s s u e s fo r these retreats. The CAS Results M a t r i x (Attachment 1) w i l l serve as a 
check l is t o f the intermediate and higher leve l outcomes fo r wh ich the country team i s accountable. The 
details o f the M&E mechanisms w i l l be developed and agreed w i t h the c l ien t and stakeholders. These 
M&E exercises w i l l be c r i t ica l fo r p rov id ing the f lex ib i l i ty requ ired in a four-year C A S and w i l l feed in to 
the CAS Progress Repor t to be prepared and presented two years after the CAS i s discussed.

period. As ind ica ted in para. 74 , a comprehensive M&E program i s be ing developed and w i l l prov ide 
t ime ly feedback to the Government, developers, In terna t iona l F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions and other interested 
stakeholders to take corrective ac t ion in imp lemen ta t ion o f the d i f feren t management programs, and also 
to track outcomes. The M&E f ramewo rk fo r the pro jec t includes: supervision o f phys ica l imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the hydropower pro jec t b y pro fess iona l engineering f i r m s under contract to the developers and the 
Government; mon i to r ing b y the D a m Safety Rev iew Panel and the Panel o f Exper ts (bo th mandated b y 
the W o r l d Bank ’s safeguard po l ic ies) ; systematic mon i to r ing o f the technical and safeguards components 
o f the pro jec t and i ts impacts b y one o r more professional firms o n beha l f o f the p r iva te and pub l ic sector

project; and supervision b y staff o f the W o r l d B a n k and other In terna t iona l F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions 

96. 

A strong f ie ld presence w i l l be essential fo r monitoring CAS implementation. A greater field 

presence w i l l be needed to ensure results and to help build capacity fo r imp lemen t ing more complex 
infrastructure projects g iven the NT 2 p rog ram o f ac t iv i t ies . The Coun try O f f i c e w i l l need to ma in ta in 
excellent wo rk ing relationships and open dialogue w i t h a l l levels o f government. D o n o r coord ina t ion w i l l 
also be a c r i t ica l element o f f i e l d presence, as w e l l as par t ic ipa t ion in Dono r W o r k i n g Groups. The W o r l d 
Bank ’s administrative budget w i l l be allocated t o re f lec t the C A S pr ior i t ies , inc lud ing the need to f u l l y 
fund the maintenance o f a qua l i ty po r t fo l io , the stringent imp lemen ta t ion o f NT 2 and a l l related safeguard 
measures and consultations, the mu l t i -yea r AAA cycle, the design o f high qua l i ty operations at bo th the 
en try and imp lemen ta t ion stages, enhancement o f loca l capacity, and the ab i l i ty t o undertake e f fec t ive 
partnerships and co l labora t ive e f for ts . In keeping w i t h recent trends, i t i s expected that various Trust 
Funds, usua l ly executed b y loca l counterparts, w i l l continue to p rov ide add i t iona l grant resources (such as 
GEF, IDF, PHRD ) fo r selected operations, p ro jec t preparation, research, and strategy formu la t ion . 

- 47 - 

97 . 
The Bank w i l l continue to expand its capacity for improved communications and outreach with 
various stakeholders involved in Lao PDR’s development. The Bank w i l l build upon the considerable 

experience gained in i ts invo lvemen t w i t h the N T 2 project, where proactive engagement and communica- 
tions w i t h various stakeholders has been accorded a h i g h p r io r i ty , b o t h loca l ly and in terna t iona l ly . These 
activities have focused on an t ic ipa t ing and m i t iga t ing risk, sharing in fo rma t ion on pro jec t development 
and the Bank ’s assistance stance, and updating the in terna t iona l commun i ty on L a o PDR’s progress w i t h 
reforms and pove r ty reduc t ion efforts. M o v i n g forward, the Bank w i l l strengthen i t s capacity to carry out 
continuous engagement w i t h various stakeholders. The Bank w i l l wo rk in coord ina t ion w i t h donors in 
creating a mu l t idono r funded public in fo rma t ion and development outreach center as a foca l po in t fo r 
housing and disseminating development in forma t ion . This Pub l ic In fo rma t ion Center w i l l share in forma- 
t ion on development in general as we l l as sharing research. These efforts -- comb ined w i t h greater em- 
phasis on engaging stakeholders, c i v i l society, and loca l communities in the development, design, and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank-supported projects -- as w e l l as increased invo lvemen t o f loca l academicians and 
researchers in the Bank ’s AAA w o r k and better dissemination o f findings, should he lp to imp rove the im- 
pact o f Bank work , as w e l l as fam i l ia r i ty w i t h the Bank and i t s ro le in L a o PDR ’s development. 

V. MANAGING RISKS 

98 . 
The CAS presents an ambitious program supporting selected elements of the broad NGPES 
agenda and i t s implementation and achievement of results are subject to multiple risks. The r i s k s f a l l 

under the f o l l ow i n g fou r categories: first, r i s k s ar is ing f r om performance by the Government on the 
NGPES, wh ich i s the framework around wh ich the CAS i s designed, caused b y f luc tua t ing po l i t ica l 
comm i tmen t and weak imp lemen ta t ion capacity; second, r i s k s ar is ing spec i f ica l ly f r o m lack o f 
performance under the N T 2 project; third, risks re la t ing to the effectiveness o f support extended to the 
country b y i t s external development partners, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank ; and fourth, risks ar is ing f r om 
external factors over wh ich the Government has n o con tro l . The management o f these r i s k s w i l l determine 
the pace and d i rec t ion o f fu ture p o l i c y reforms under NGPES, as w e l l as imp lemen ta t ion performance on 
the N T 2 pro jec t . The proposed C A S scenarios and IDA programs are designed to address these issues , 
inc lud ing cases o f slower or faster reforms and modu la t ing levels o f IDA support. 

99 . 

Country-level NGPES risks revo lve around po ten t ia l for weak po l i t ica l w i l l and comm i tmen t to 
reforms, as w e l l as weak capacity to imp lemen t desired re forms in areas such as revenue mob i l iza t ion , 
trade reform, SOE restructuring, etc. (see para. 38 ) . There i s also the risk o f weaker engagement on 
broader re fo rm issues after N T 2 i s approved. However , w i t h the NGPES consultative development 
process and subsequent approval b y the Na t iona l Assembly, the Government has generated broad na t iona l 
stakeholder comm i tmen t to the NGPES program as a who le and to the push f o r reg iona l co l labora t ion and 
in tegra t ion in par t icu lar . In addition, donors have raised their leve ls o f co l labora t ion and j o i n t ac t ion w i t h 
the Government in the development, and n o w implementation, o f the NGPES; and regular Round Table 
and other meetings w i l l focus a t ten t ion on the measures needed t o sustain r e f o rm momentum. The W o r l d 
Bank program w i l l also p rov ide a strong basis fo r continued d ia logue w i t h the Government on d i f feren t 
options fo r reforms. A l though some reversals in progress on reforms cannot be ruled out and the ove ra l l 
pace o f reforms w i l l vary f rom sector to sector, the in terna l momen tum f o r r e f o rm and the coordinated 
support o f the donor commun i ty should he lp sustain po l i t ica l commitment. S im i la r ly , w i t h regard to 
weak government capacity, the UNDP , the W o r l d Bank, and other donors are wo rk ing c lose ly on 
supporting the development of government capacity to tu rn i ts NGPES p rog ram in to p r io r i t ized and 
costed ac t ion plans that are imp lemen tab le b y key m i n i s t r i e s and many donors are wo rk ing w i t h the 
Government to improve key systems that are the backbone to an e f f ic ien t pub l ic administration. The 
W o r l d Bank ’s planned support for strengthening capacity throughou t the CAS , in i t s AAA, and through 
i ts investment support program, h igh l igh ts concrete capacity development measures to strengthen 

- 48 - 

imp lemen ta t ion at the ins t i tu t iona l leve l . Progress in these respects w i l l a l l he lp alleviate the very rea l 
capacity constraints that curren t ly exist. 

100. Risks arising from lack of performance under NT2. These risks relate in par t icu lar to use o f 

na tura l resource revenues fo r non-poverty re la ted activities and fa i lure o f the Government to abide b y i t s 
commitments in imp lemen t ing the c r i t ica l safeguard arrangements fo r NT2 . W o r l d Bank and other donor 
assistance in support o f L a o PDR’s PEMSP and the N T 2 revenue management arrangements w i l l be the 
p r ima ry instruments fo r managing the revenue management risk. N T 2 pro jec t arrangements inc lude a set 
o f lega l agreements and care fu l ly designed enforcement mechanism, wh i le the planned series o f PRSCs 
and accompanying Technical Support w i l l he lp ma in ta in momen tum on the broader program o f Pub l ic 
F inanc ia l Management reform, he lp ing the Government to systematically address issues as they a r i s e and 
deve lop ing a system that w i l l be more e f fec t ive and more transparent fo r a l l na tura l resource revenues. 
S im i la r ly w i t h regard to safeguards, w i th in the context o f the N T 2 program, the W o r l d Bank w i l l p rov ide 
assistance fo r supervision and mon i to r ing through the N T 2 Guarantee and the NTSEP; wh i le at the 
na t iona l level, the LEnS pro jec t w i l l complement NTSEP b y addressing capacity and po l icy issues , 
inc lud ing strengthened capacities in environmental assessment, mon i to r ing and compliance, resettlement 
p lann ing and implementation, protected area management, r ive r basin and watershed management, and 
env ironmen ta l education and awareness. 
Independent technical and environmental experts w i l l also 
continue to be invo lved in mon i to r ing imp lemen ta t ion to he lp guard against safeguard violations. F ina l ly , 
the partnership agreement among the donors invo lved in NT2 , that i s being shared w i t h the broader donor 
commun i ty , h igh l igh ts the need fo r coordinated donor responses, inc lud ing w i t h respect to the 
Government’s performance on N T 2 . IDA assistance also w i l l be in f luenced du r ing the current CAS 
pe r iod and beyond b y government performance on i t s lega l obligations to the W o r l d Bank regard ing the 
N T 2 pro jec t . 

101. Risks relating to uncoordinated donor support. The donor commun i ty in L a o PDR i s mak ing 

progress in strengthening i ts coord ina t ion but a po ten t ia l lack o f comm i tmen t b y donors to a l ign the ir 
resources around common frameworks cou ld pose a risk fo r imp lemen ta t ion o f the NGPES and 
achievement o f CAS objectives. This risk i s compounded b y the W o r l d Bank ’s re la t ive ly l o w leve l o f 
IDA allocations and administrative budget. These factors ca l l fo r an approach that coordinates and thus 
leverages the W o r l d Bank ’s AAA wo rk and sma l l lending p rog ram through stronger partnerships w i t h 
other donors. Fortunately, strong donor coord ina t ion exists around the NGPES and w i l l continue to be 
re in forced through the regu lar ly scheduled Dono r Wo rk ing Groups and increased use o f harmon iza t ion 
guidelines. The use o f the U N D P supported Round Table Mee t ings as a p la t fo rm to de l iver messages t o 
a l l stakeholders and rea f f i rm commitments t o the Government’s v is ion should also help t o strengthen 
coord ina t ion and collaboration. 

102. External risks. Changes in the trade regime, such as the end o f the MFA, o r adverse economic 
developments in L a o PDR ’ s ma in trad ing partners cou ld weaken export prospects. M i t i g a t i o n measures 
inc lude strong movement fo rwa rd on the In tegra ted Trade Framework where government comm i tmen t i s 
high; ana ly t ica l wo rk on the Investment C l ima te Assessment leading to p o l i c y changes, imp roved 
incentives and increased f lex ib i l i ty in the p r iva te sector to respond to shocks; continued support to 
strengthened dialogue and partnership w i t h ne ighbor ing countries 
to fac i l i ta te 
in tegra t ion and 
d ivers i f ica t ion ; support fo r the p r iva te sector through IFC and MPDF; and con t inued PRSC support fo r 
key po l icy changes.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

103. As L a o PDR continues to implement i t s NGPES program and accelerate the pos i t ive trend in 
reduc ing poverty, the alignment o f the W o r l d Bank’s CAS to support t h i s e f fo r t w i l l be s ign i f ican t ly 
strengthened b y more comprehensive capacity development, 
imp roved donor coord ina t ion and 
harmonization, and expanded ana ly t ica l and advisory activities. The proposed framework to evaluate the 
achievement o f the CAS objectives and W o r l d Bank performance w i l l validate whether th is new approach 
to operating in L a o PDR w i l l enhance the development impac t o f IDA resources. L a o PDR w i l l continue 
to need concessional assistance f r om i ts in terna t iona l partners and this CAS prov ides the foundation fo r 
that support over the next fou r years.

Lao PDR: Debt Sustainability Analysis 
November 2004 
(IMP, World Bank and Asian Development Bank joint report) 

1. 

L ao PDR has an elevated debt burden that places it in the high risk category among 

low-income countries. D e b t s tock ra t ios are w e l l above the i n d i c a t i v e thresho lds f o r coun tr ies with 
comparab le p o l i c i e s a n d ins t i tu t ions . A l t h o u g h the deb t service schedu le l o o k s manageable o n the 
ex terna l side, the coun t ry ’s p o o r revenue genera t ion ind ica tes tha t deb t service requ iremen ts over the 
n e x t f e w years w i l l put pressure o n the governmen t budge t , with the risk tha t p r i o r i t y soc ia l 
expend i tures w i l l b e c r ow d e d ou t . 

2 . 

At end-2003 L a o PDR’s stock of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt, in 

NPV terms, was US$1.9 billion. This i s high in compa r ison t o s tandard mac roeconom ic ind ica tors , 
represen t ing 9 2 pe rcen t o f GDP, 2 1 8 percen t o f exports, and 534 pe rcen t o f p u b l i c revenues. Based o n 
this debt stock, s t a f f ca lcu la t ions suggest tha t L a o P D R i s e l i g i b l e f o r HIPC deb t r e l i e f (B o x 1). 

3. 

Most of L a o PDR’s debt - about 70 percent of the nominal stock at end-2003 - 
comprises concessional loans from multilateral creditors, primarily the World Bank and the 

AsDB. T h e b igges t b i l a t e r a l c red i to r i s Russia, w h i c h accoun ted f o r a lmos t 80 pe rcen t o f the s tock o f 
b i l a t e r a l deb t at end-2003 . S ta te-owned enterprises (SOEs) accoun t f o r just unde r 5 percen t o f the 
debt-stock. 

4. 
The stock of Russian debt at end-2003 i s estimated at US$387 million, after applying a 
70 percent upfront discount and an exchange rate of 0.6 roubles to the dollar. An agreement was 

reached be tween L a o P D R a n d Russ ia in December 2003, w h i c h g ran ted a n NPV r e d u c t i o n o f abou t 
2 0 pe rcen t o n the conso l ida ted deb t stock. [The L a o au tho r i t ies h a v e subsequen t ly approached Russ ia 
f o r m o r e concess iona l t e rm s , w h i c h w o u l d h e l p t h em in m e e t i n g t h e high deb t serv ice paymen ts 
forecast f o r the near fu ture . ] 

5 . 
The debt sustainability analysis indicates that in order for L a o PDR to lower its high 
debt stock ratios and debt service-to-revenue ratio over the medium term, three important 

conditions need to be satisfied. First, expor ts and GDP must c o n t i n u e t o g r o w r o b u s t l y . Second, 
f isca l revenues as a percen tage o f GDP must con t inue t o r ise . Third, p u b l i c b o r r o w i n g as a percentage 
o f GDP must decrease ove r the med ium - te rm , and care must b e t a k e n t o m a i n t a i n a r e l a t i v e l y high 
average l e v e l o f concess iona l i ty in n e w b o r r ow i n g . 

Box 1. Lao PDR’s H I P C Eligibility 
Lao PDR currently meets the eligibility criteria and fulfills a l l the conditions necessary to benefit from the 
enhanced H I P C Initiative. I t i s a PRGF-eligible and IDA -on ly country, w i th a GDP per capita o f U S 3 2 0 in 2003. 
T h e NPV o f public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) extemal debt at end-2003, after the application o f a stock-of-debt 
reduction on Naples t e r m s on Pans Club debt and assuming comparable treatment b y a l l other official bilateral and 
commercial creditors, would amount t o about $1 billion, corresponding to an NPV o f debt-to-exports r a t i o o f 198 
percent ’. Thus the country i s we l l above the 150 percent threshold required for HIPC under the exports criterion ’. 
The Lao authorities have emphasized that they do not intend to avail themselves o f H I P C debt r e l i e f . T h e i r view 
i s that the transactions costs o f the HIPC procedure and possibly reduced access to bilateral and commercial inflows 
would outweigh the gains from debt r e l i e f in the medium-term. 

1, T h i s figure i s based upon the application o f the HIPC DSA methodology. I t differs from the debt-to-exports ratio shown in Table 1, for 
three main reasons First, instead o f a common discount r a t e o f 5 percent on a l l debt; the HIPC framework utilizes currency-specific discount 
rates. Second, i t uses a three year backward-looking average o f exports in the denominator, rather than current year exports. Third, i t assumes 
an application o f traditional debt r e l i e f (Naples terms). 
2. Lao PDR does not qualify for HIPC debt r e l i e f under the fiscal criterion, s i n c e its revenue-to-GDP ratio i s well beneath the 15 percent 
threshold.

111. Sensitivity Analysis: Alternative Macroeconomic Scenario 

14. 
Sensitivity analysis i s undertaken on the basis o f an alternative macroeconomic scenario 
which corresponds t o a slowdown in econom ic reforms (Tables 1 and 2, and Figures 1 and 2). 
This scenario i s chosen f o r i t s p l a u s i b i l i t y ; despite the N T 2 p r o j e c t a n d the O x i a n a m ines , a 
s lacken ing pace o f s t ruc tu ra l r e f o rm s c o u l d lead t o l o w e r g r o w t h ra tes o f GDP a n d expor ts in the 
m e d i um term, and i n s u f f i c i e n t f i s c a l r e f o rm c o u l d l e a d t o l o w e r revenue gene ra t ion compared t o the 
base l ineU6 

15. 
The alternative macroeconomic scenario assumes lower export and GDP growth, and 
poor revenue generation. T h e g r o w t h ra te o f expor ts i s 2 percen tage p o i n t s l o w e r than in the 
base l ine scenario, b e g i n n i n g in 2006 . G D P g r ow t h i s s im i l a r l y k e p t b e l o w the base l ine f i o m 2 0 0 6 
onwards , and f la t tens out a t 5 pe rcen t pe r annum ove r the medium t e rm . VAT i s n o t in t roduced , a n d 
tha t adm in is t ra t ive r e f o rm s such as the cen t ra l iza t ion o f cus toms revenue fa l te r o v e r the m e d i um - 
t e r m . Hence , t a x revenues as a percentage o f GDP stay a t t h e i r 2004 l e v e l o f 11.3 pe rcen t o f GDP. 

16. 
On the external side th e r e i s not much qualitative difference from the baseline. T h e NPV 
o f deb t- to-GDP r a t i o r em a i n s above the i n d i c a t i v e th resho ld th roughou t , f o l l o w i n g t h e same d e c l i n i n g 
p a t h as in the baseline, but o n l y r e a c h i n g 4 1 percen t in 2019 ins tead o f 37.8 pe rcen t in the base l ine . 
S im i l a r l y , the NPV o f deb t t o expo r ts dec l ines a f te r 2005 but f a l l s t o a r a t i o o f 190 pe rcen t in 2 0 1 9

manageable th roughou t unde r the a l terna t ive scenario. 

17. 
On the fiscal side, the alternative scenario emphasizes the risk to the government budget 
due to debt servicing requirements in the near term . T h e NPV o f deb t- to-revenue r a t i o aga in 
rema ins above the i n d i c a t i v e th resho ld throughou t , but n o w i t does n o t f a l l b e l o w 300 percen t . T h e 
deb t-serv ice b u r d e n as a percen tage o f revenues i s cons ide rab ly h i g h e r in the med ium - te rm . In 
pa r t icu la r , over the n e x t f e w years the deb t serv ice- to-revenue r a t i o i s 2-3 percen tage p o i n t s h i g h e r 
than the a lready e leva ted r a t i o o f the base l ine scenario, a n d the r a t i o does n o t f a l l b e l o w 2 0 pe rcen t 
even by the end o f the p r o j e c t i o n p e r i o d . I f this scenario we re t o transp ire , the f i s c a l enve lope f o r

I V . Conclusion

L a o PDR currently has an extremely high stock of debt, placing i t in the high risk 
category among low-income countries. T h e NF’V o f deb t in r e l a t i o n t o GDP, expor ts and

Note: The program is merely indicative. Actual size of projects (IDA Credits and Grants), timing, and overall annual commitments will depend on the 
availability of IDA resources through the continuing Lending Strategy Review (LSR) exercises (in particular, in light of IDA-14 outcomes), the status of project 
preparation, and the definition of the project and components to be financed by IDA to be agreed with the government and other cofinancing partners.
