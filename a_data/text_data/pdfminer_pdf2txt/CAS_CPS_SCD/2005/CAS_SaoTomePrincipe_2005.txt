I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. With an estimated GDP o f US$60 million in 2004, the Democratic Republic of 
Sao Tome and Principe (STP) i s Africa’s smallest economy and one of the poorest 
countries in the world. App rox ima te ly 54 percent o f i t s popu la t ion o f 150,000 i s p o o r 
and 15 percent live in extreme pove r ty . Soc ia l ind ica to rs are weak and im p r o v i n g o n l y 
s low ly , with the l i k e l i h o o d that mos t M D G s w i l l n o t b e reached. After a p ro longed p e r i o d 
o f economic m ismanagemen t since independence, a series o f economic re fo rms we re 
imp lemen ted s ta r t ing in 1999. As a result, economic performance im p r o v e d and the 
g r ow t h ra te o f r e a l GDP per cap i ta rose f r o m 3.3 percent t o 4 percent be tween 1999 and 
2003. T h e PRSP was f ina l ized in early-2003 and has been p a r t i a l l y imp lemen ted t o date 
a l though full imp lemen ta t ion has been launched in 2005 l . In J u l y 2001, STP h e l d i t s third 
multi-party e lec t ion w h i c h was deemed t o b e fa i r and was conducted peace fu l ly . 
Nevertheless, the p o l i t i c a l economy suffers f r o m i n s t a b i l i t y and, w h i l e a m o r e ac t ive c i v i l 
society has g radua l ly taken fo rm , p o l i t i c a l and c i v i l ins t i tu t ions r em a i n f rag i le . 

2. 
STP i s now at the threshold of a dramatic change with la rge o i l resources 
estimated in its territorial waters. The a r r i v a l o f o i l production, anticipated in 2012, i s 
t h e mos t s ign i f ican t economic event fac ing STP with far-reaching soc ia l and p o l i t i c a l 
imp l ica t ions . T o date, STP has taken several p o s i t i v e and encouraging steps t o prepare f o r 
the a r r iva l o f o i l revenues and t o set up transparent o i l revenue management mechanisms 
that se t i t apart f r o m other resou rce - r ich countries in A f r i c a that have squandered their 
wealth. W h i l e i t i s too early t o j u d g e whether STP w i l l make e f fec t ive use o f i t s o i l 
revenues, the re i s an impo r tan t w i n d o w o f oppo r tun i ty t o p r o v i d e concerted in te rna t iona l 
support t o ensure that o i l w i l l m a k e a p o s i t i v e impac t o n p o v e r t y reduc t ion . 

3. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for STP covers the four-year period 
from FY 0 6 to FYO9. T h e C A S supports the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP and sets ou t the 
p lanned l e n d i n g and non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies o f the W o r l d Bank and the i r in tended results. 
This C A S b e n e f i t s f r om a m o r e robus t analysis and know ledge base o f the coun t ry than 
ex is ted at the t im e o f the p rev ious C A S (FY01-05)2 as a result o f the broader economic and 
sector w o r k that has been conduc ted since then and the m o r e in tens ive d ia logue be tween 
the B a n k and the Government. A b o v e all, the strategy remains tightly focused, building 
u p o n on -go ing ac t iv i t ies and enhancing and deepening the strategy l a i d ou t in the p rev ious 
CAS , as w e l l as building o n the lessons l e am t f r o m i t s imp lemen ta t ion . T h e t w o p r i n c i p a l 
objectives o f the Bank ’s strategy are: 
t o support the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP and strengthen the areas whe re the 
PRSP needs t o b e imp roved , as h i g h l i g h t e d in the JSAN ; and 
t o p r o v i d e assistance t o STP t o ensure tha t i t i s su f f ic ien t ly p repa red t o 
m a x im i z e the bene f i ts o f fu tu re o i l revenues.

I T h e PRSP was promulgated by the President in January 2003, and an update o f the strategy was issued in January 2005. The 
PRSP was discussed b y the Board o f the World Bank on Ap r i l 21, 2005 (Sao Tome and Principe, Joint IDA - IMF Staff 
Advisory Note on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, March 3,2005, Report No. 31726-STP) and i s due to be discussed at 
the Board o f the IMF in mid-May 2005. 
I t was not submitted earlier because the macro-framework was insufficiently 
developed to put the poverty reduction strategy in to full perspective.

As STP i s a tiny country, the Bank’s lending program i s naturally small with 
an indicative allocation of US$5.5 million for F Y O 6 - O S (Base Case). U n d e r the I D A - 1 4 
framework, STP i s cu r ren t ly e l ig ib le t o receive a l l o f i t s F Y 0 6 IDA a l loca t ion o n grant 
terms. The C A S focuses o n just a couple o f selected areas o f in te rven t ion t o m a x im i z e the 
Bank’s impac t and t o ensure comp lemen ta r i ty with other development partners. 
particular, an ove r - r id ing theme o f the strategy i s that the B a n k w i l l assist the Government 
t o “scale-up” f o r the fu tu re era when i t w i l l have high leve ls o f i t s o w n resources f r o m o i l . 
The challenge i s t o de l ive r a p rog ram o f Bank assistance w h i c h encompasses a l im i t e d 
envelope o f f inanc ia l resources but concentrates o n a broader p r o g r am o f ove ra l l support 
i n c l u d i n g p o l i c y dialogue, AAA, ESW, IDF grants and T rus t Funds, as w e l l as the Bank ’s 
r o l e in leve rag ing other donors’ resources.

The World Bank’s program focuses on strengthening the macroeconomic and 
public sector context and building the required institutions and capacity to ensure the 
sustainable use o f future o i l revenues. The specific avenues o f support are: 
(i) con t inue the imp lemen ta t ion o f on -go ing activities, espec ia l ly with respect t o social 
sector service delivery, capac i ty -bu i ld ing 
in p u b l i c 
finance management, 
ins t i tu t iona l support t o manag ing the o i l sector, and f o l l ow - u p o n recommendations 
o f the Bank ’s ESW and AAA. As pa r t o f this, add i t iona l f inanc ing w i l l be 
p rov ided t o the on -go ing IDA projects; and 
(ii) m o v e g radua l ly t o p r o v i d i n g Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Operations (budget support) in 
FY07 , with the ob jec t ive o f strengthening imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP, p repa r ing 
the g round f o r manag ing f u t u r e o i l revenues i n t o the budge t and m a x im i z i n g IDA’S 
impac t . In the p e r i o d lead ing up t o p r o v i d i n g budget support, the B a n k w i l l w o r k 
c lose ly with the Gove rnmen t t o prepare the coun t ry ’s f i d u c i a r y fi-amework and 
ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty f o r the management and imp lemen ta t ion o f budge t support. 
These Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Operations w i l l be triggered by sound macroeconomic, 
p u b l i c finance and o i l management and w i l l be c lose ly l i n k e d t o the PRSP A n n u a l 
Progress Reports and prepared in co l labo ra t ion with donors. 

6. 
The STP context i s subject to several risks. T h e m a i n r i s k comes f r o m the 
po ten t ia l mis-management o f the influx o f the o i l contract signature bonuses and their 
impac t o n p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty . T h e Bank w i l l a i m t o m i t iga te this r i s k th rough ensuring that 
the o i l revenue management f ramewo rk i s respected, that the signature bonuses are 
translated i n t o transparent budge ta ry allocations and by con t inued and concerted e f fo r ts t o 
build ins t i tu t iona l capacity and engage in d ia logue /consu l ta t ion with Gove rnmen t and c i v i l 
society. A l t h o u g h STP has made some e f fo r ts t o diversify i t s exports, i t rema ins ex t reme ly 
vulnerable t o exogenous shocks. T o m i t iga te this risk i t i s v i t a l t o con t inue the course o f 
prudent p u b l i c sector finance management, strengthening capac i ty and inves t ing in human 
and ins t i tu t iona l capital, a l l co re aspects o f the Bank ’s p rog ram . A fu r the r risk i s posed as 
regards the Government’s w i l l ingness and capac i ty t o pursue re fo rms in a sustainable and 
consistent manner. The B a n k p lans t o o f f -se t this risk by w o r k i n g c lose ly w i th the IMF 
and other development partners t o p r o v i d e concerted f inanc ia l and adv iso ry support t o 
ensure that there i s f o l l ow - t h r o u g h o n the r e f o rm p rog ram and tha t there i s su f f ic ien t focus 
o n building capacity. T h e B a n k w i l l con t inue t o pu rsue a f rank and open d ia logue with the 
Government about the impo r tance o f re fo rms in order t o increase inves tmen t and fo re ign

STP’s h is to r ica l evo lut ion has been ve ry much affected b y i t s he r i tage as a 
Portuguese colony. U n d e r Portugal’s ea r ly r u l e , STP became f i rs t one o f the wo r ld ’s 
largest producers o f su ar (in the m id -16 th century) and then a m a j o r p roduce r o f co f fee

independence f o r STP was proclaimed. T rans i t ion t o s ing le -pa r ty M a r x i s t r u l e was almost

de te r io ra t ion during the 1980s and pressure f r o m b o t h the popu la t ion and western donors,

established and the f i rs t multi-party leg is la t ive e lec t ion was h e l d in January 19915.

Since 1991 , S T P has been t rans fo rmed f r o m a M a r x i s t one-party state in to a

a 5 year t e r m in July 2001, in STP’s third m u l t i - p a r t y e lec t ion w h i c h was deemed t o b e 
fair and was conducted peace fb l ly . Since then, the coun t ry has been ruled by a p o l i t i c a l 
cohab i ta t ion with the p res idency held by a semi-independent candidate and the 
parliament d i v i d e d a lmos t even ly be tween the t w o m a i n p o l i t i c a l parties. Nevertheless, 
for such a sma l l country, the p o l i t i c a l scene i s v e r y comp lex . A unity Government ex is ts

The p o l i t i c a l economy suffers f r o m inhe ren t i n s t a b i l i t y due t o the vague separation o f 
powe rs ou t l ined in the cons t i tu t ion be tween the Presidency, N a t i o n a l Assembly and the

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 

8. 
The PRSP was finalized by Government in late-2002, promulgated by the 
President in January 2003 and was partially implemented in the 2003-2004 budgets 
(see foo tno te 1). In January 2005, the Government prepared a set o f annexes t o the PRSP 
m a i n documen t w h i c h p r o v i d e d updates o n the p rev ious t w o years o f macroeconomic 
performance, ind ica to rs and imp lemen ta t ion infrastructure, as well as a summa ry o f the 
new pe t ro leum revenue management law , and a summa ry o f the PRSP imp lemen ta t ion 
experience in 2003-2004. The PRSP and i t s re la ted Jo in t S t a f f A d v i s o r y N o t e (JSAN) 
were discussed by the Boa rds o f the W o r l d B a n k and IMF in April and M a y 2005 
respectively. 
9 . 
The PRSP sets an ambitious policy agenda - with an ove ra l l cost o f about 
US$210 m i l l i o n f o r the f i r s t seven years o f imp lemen ta t ion . I t lays ou t a strategic p l a n 
for pove r ty reduc t ion based o n five p i l la rs : 

a) R e f o r m o f p u b l i c institutions, capacity building, and p r om o t i o n o f a p o l i c y o f 
good govemance; 
b) Accelerated and red is t r ibu t ive g row th ; 
c) C rea t ion o f oppo r tun i t ies t o increase and d i v e r s i f y i n c om e f o r the poor; 
d) Human resource development and access t o basic soc ia l services; 
e) A d o p t i o n o f mechanisms t o mon i to r , assess and update the strategy. 

10. An Action Plan i s attached to the PRSP to put these strategic pillars in place, 
w h i c h has the f o l l o w i n g objectives: (i) a t ta in a GDP g r ow t h ra te o f 5 percent starting in 
2003; (ii) reduce by h a l f the percentage o f the popu la t ion living in p o v e r t y by 2010, and 
reduce th is f igu re t o less than 1/3 by 2015; (iii) p r o v i d e the en t i re p o p u l a t i o n w i th access 
t o basic services by 2015 and h e l p im p r o v e their q u a l i t y o f l i fe ; (iv) cons ide rab ly reduce 
the social and gender gap be tween d is t r ic ts in Siio T om 6 and be tween these and the 
Au tonomous R e g i o n o f P r inc ipe , as w e l l as be tween u rban and r u r a l populations; and 
(v) p romo te and build ins t i tu t iona l capacity and a p o l i c y o f g o o d govemance. 

11. 
The PRSP’s medium-term macroeconomic outlook assumes an average 
growth rate of 4.3 percent during 2005-07, a dec l in ing i n f l a t i o n ra te and b r o a d l y stable 
n om i n a l interest rate, supported by strong f isca l conso l ida t ion . T h e ou t look also 
encompasses con t ro l ove r p u b l i c expenditures w h i l e safe-guarding p ro -poo r spending, a 
prudent mone ta ry p o l i c y , a flexible exchange rate and the imp lemen ta t ion o f a 
comprehensive s t ruc tu ra l r e f o rm agenda that inc ludes a n ew inves tmen t code t o p romo te 
p r iva te investment. 

12. 
The full PRSP i s a result of an extensive consultative process by stakeholders. 
The process was managed by a steering comm i t tee cha i red by the Prime Minister and 
consisting o f representatives o f gove rnmen t and c i v i l society. Nume rous wo rkshops were 
organized f o r c i v i l society, p o l i t i c a l parties and other stakeholders in the six d is t r ic ts o n 
the is land o f Sao T om e and o n the island o f P r inc ipe . A PRSP unit was se t up in the 
Ministry o f P lann ing a n d F inance t o ensure the imp lemen ta t ion and m o n i t o r i n g o f the 

PRSP: a key r o l e o f this unit i s t o coordinate the various ac t iv i t ies o f a l l the M i n i s t r i e s , as 
w e l l as p r iva te sector and c i v i l society, under the ove ra l l f ramewo rk o f the PRSP. 

13. 
The Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of the PRSP. The J S A N 
indicates tha t the PRSP p rov ides a f a i r l y comprehensive set o f ind ica to rs and targets f o r 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ing the sectoral strategies, especially in education, hea l th and 
infrastructure. The se t o f med ium - and long - te rm targets b r o a d l y ta l l ies with the MDG s . 
Some o f the pove r ty targets, however, are m o r e amb i t ious - pa r t icu la r ly the 50 percent 
d rop in p o v e r t y targeted by 2010 - and w i l l require m a j o r sustained e f fo r ts and f inanc ia l 
support. I t i s recogn ized that e f fo r ts are needed t o enhance the qua l i ty and ava i lab i l i ty o f 
ind ica to rs and t o strengthen statistical capacity. The Gove rnmen t i s ta rge t ing the 
strengthening o f i t s PRSP unit t o enhance imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing . 

14. 
The JSAN underlines that the PRSP provides a reliable framework for 
reducing poverty. I t s m a i n strengths are that i t p rov ides a p o v e r t y diagnosis and a 
comprehensive private-sector-led development strategy, pays special a t ten t ion t o cross- 
cu t t ing issues , n o t a b l y governance, and iden t i f ies de ta i led ind ica to rs t o m o n i t o r progress 
in p o v e r t y reduction. The J S A N highlights that there are several areas o f weakness in the 
PRSP and that these c o u l d be strengthened th rough the f o l l ow i n g actions: (i) p r i o r i t i z e 
sectoral strategies and make them fully consistent with the annual f isca l budget and the 
ove ra l l medium-term p o v e r t y a l lev ia t ion strategy, (ii) launch an in -dep th analysis o f the 
impac t o f po ten t ia l o i l revenues o n the economy; and (iii) make an assessment o f the 
red is t r ibu t ive effect o f the proposed reforms, i n c l u d i n g taxation, land red is t r ibu t ion , and 
p r iva t iza t ion . 

15. 
Furthermore, the J S A N underlines the impo r tance o f fu r the r w o r k in securing 
good governance and fighting corruption, espec ia l ly in the con tex t o f rising o i l revenue. 
Trade p o l i c y i s also singled ou t as need ing attention, pa r t icu la r ly given the emphasis o f 
the PRSP o n the need f o r n o n - o i l inves tmen t and the d ive rs i f ica t ion o f p roduc t ion and 
exports. In conclusion, the J S A N highlights two m a j o r issues: (i) the Gove rnmen t must 
succeed in a t t rac t ing a substantially h ighe r l e v e l o f p r iva te inves tmen t and add i t iona l 
donor support t o achieve the desired high GDP g r ow t h ra te targets until o i l p r o d u c t i o n 
starts; and (ii) capac i ty mus t be strengthened t o ensure full imp lemen ta t ion and 
m o n i t o r i n g o f the PRSP.

Macroeconomic Framework 

16. After a prolonged period o f economic mis-management since independence, a 
ser ies of economic reforms were implemented starting in 1999. These a imed at: 
(i) pursuing p ruden t f isca l and mone ta ry po l ic ies ; (ii) im p r o v i n g the e f f i c i e n c y o f p u b l i c 
spending; (iii) l i b e r a l i z i n g the economy by r e f o rm i n g the tariff structure, p repa r ing f o r a 
l ibe ra l iza t ion o f the telecoms sector and p r i v a t i z i n g a numbe r o f p u b l i c enterprises 
(iv) accelerating sectoral re fo rms by deve lop ing n ew strategies in hea l th and education; 
and (v) strengthening human and i n s t i t u t i o n a l capacities, especially in the nascent 
pe t ro leum sector.

17. 
As a result of these reforms, economic performance improved which resulted 
in a more stabilized economy, sustained output growth and lower inflation. The 
g r ow t h ra te o f rea l GDP per capita rose f r o m 3.3 percent t o 4 percent be tween 1999 and 
2003. T h e g r ow t h dynam ic re l ied on a series o f re fo rms supported by the IMF and the 
Bank , an imp rovemen t in w o r l d cocoa prices, and g r ow t h in the tou r ism and cons t ruc t ion 
sectors. I n f l a t i o n was also b rough t under con t ro l and the C P I dropped f r o m 12.6 percent 
in 1999 t o 9.2 percent in 2002. In 2003, the increase in energy prices, pos t -coup social 
expenditures and c i v i l service salary increases con t r ibu ted t o a r ise o f the i n f l a t i o n rate t o 
9.6 percent. 

18. 

2003 as 

I n 2004, r e a l GDP growth i s estimated to be slightly lower (3.8 percent) than 
the expected increase in pe t ro leum re la ted economic ac t iv i t ies did n o t 
ma te r ia l ize . The ove ra l l f isca l d e f i c i t i s estimated t o have increased f r o m 17 percent o f 
GD P in 2003 t o 26 percent in 2004. The external current account d e f i c i t (exc lud ing 
grants) i s expected t o r i s e t o 61.5 percent o f GDP in 2004, f r o m 54.4 percent in 2003, o n 
account o f n ew in f ras t ruc tu re p ro jec ts and the sharp r ise in the o i l im p o r t b i l l due t o 
increases in in te rna t iona l o i l prices. T h i s increase in o i l p r ices in 2004 has affected the 
already f rag i le economy, pa r t icu la r ly because o f the inc reas ing f inanc ia l d i f f i c u l t i e s o f 
the sole e lec t r ic i ty and wa te r company (EMAE) that i s the m a i n consumer o f impo r ted

in t roduced r o l l i n g brown-outs, e f fec t ive ly r a t i o n i n g e lec t r ic i ty since f a l l o f 2004. T h e 
l a c k o f e lec t r ic i ty has reduced the p r o d u c t i v i t y o f b o t h p u b l i c and p r iva te sectors. 

19. 
I n the monetary sector, the Central Bank relied on heavy intervention in the 
foreign exchange markets to avoid a sharp depreciation of the dobra and absorb the 
excess liquidity f r o m the la rge f isca l de f ic i ts and the r a p i d expansion o f b a n k c red i t t o the 
p r iva te sector. The Cen t ra l Bank response l e d t o a d r aw i n g d o w n o f gross o f f i c i a l 
reserves f r o m 4.5 t o 3.2 mon ths o f im p o r t s o f goods and services. 

20. 
Annual GDP growth i s envisaged to slow down in 2005 (to 3 percent) in 
response to tight financial policies under the IMF’s planned PRGF program (see 
paragraphs 22-23), but p i c k up during t h e f o l l o w i n g t w o years t o reach 5.5 percent by 
2007 o n account o f expand ing economic a c t i v i t y in the services sector and pe t ro leum -

percent by end-2007, w h i l e current f o r e i g n exchange r e s e r v e s levels are ensured (3.2 t o

21. 
The gross external financing requirements a re projected to reach $73.5

IMF Program 

22. 
After successfully completing an IMF Staff Monitored Program in 2002 and 
2003, the Gove rnmen t i s cu r ren t ly f i n a l i z i n g an agreement o n a PRGF program. The 
p rog ram i s geared towa rds re-establishing the cond i t ions f o r high and sustained economic 
g r ow t h over the medium t e rm . An ea r ly goa l i s t o correct the f rag i le budge ta ry s i tua t ion 
and widening mac roeconom ic imbalances resu l t ing f r o m the re laxa t ion o f the f isca l and 
mone ta ry po l ic ies t o imp lemen t the 2004 budget. These imbalances came about as the 
2004 budget h a d an t ic ipa ted pe t ro leum bonus signature w h i c h then did n o t ma te r ia l ize 
but spending was n o t adjusted in l ine . The expectation i s that the PRGF w i l l catalyze 
needed f inanc ing f r o m other in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions (no tab ly the A f r i c a n 
Deve lopmen t Bank) and donors t o further accelerate inves tmen t and econom ic growth. 

23. 
The program aims to place public finances back on modern and sound 
grounds while protecting pro-poor expenditures. The tax revenues are t o b e increased 
v i a in t roduc t ion o f n e w tax p o l i c y and tax adm in is t ra t ion re fo rms . Measures are also 
p red ic ted t o im p r o v e p u b l i c expenditure management and c o n t r o l expenditure g row th . In

I t w i l l also undertake a review o f the performance and status o f the p u b l i c a i rpo r t and

that attainment o f i t s pove r ty reduc t ion objectives w i l l depend c r i t i c a l l y o n ma in ta in ing

f inanc ia l po l ic ies unde rp inn ing the PRGF p rog ram .

Poverty 

24. 
The PRSP paints a stark picture o f poverty. 
The 2000-2001 
U N D P / I L O /W o r l d B a n k survey o f l iv ing cond i t ions and the UNDP p o v e r t y reviews 
show that 54 percent o f the popu la t ion l i v e s in pove r ty ; 39 percent are p o o r and 15 
percent are ex t reme ly poo r . S imu la t ions suggest that be tween the la te 1980s and 
2000/01, the share o f the popu la t ion in pove r ty m a y have increased by 6 percentage 
points, f r o m 48 percent t o 54 percent. The PRSP seeks t o reduce the percentage o f STP’s 
p o p u l a t i o n living in p o v e r t y by h a l f by 201 0 and by m o r e than t w o thirds by 2 0 15. These 
goals are very amb i t ious and, i f current trends persist, are unlikely t o b e reached. 
P r e l im i n a r y analysis indicates that the coun t ry w o u l d need t o g r ow at an average ra te 
higher than 8 percent p e r annum (i.e. almost tw i c e the average g r ow t h ra te p ro jec ted f o r 
2005-07) during the n e x t decade t o mee t the PRSP’s amb i t ious pove r ty reduc t ion targets. 
E v e n assuming an amb i t ious g r ow t h rate o f 6.5 percent p e r year f r o m 2004 t o 2010, the 
share o f the popu la t ion in pove r ty w o u l d o n l y b e reduced by about a f o u r t h t o 40 percent, 
well short o f the target in the PRSP. W h i l e a higher g r ow t h ra te i s attainable, i t w o u l d b e 
con t ingen t u p o n the authorities succeeding in a t t rac t ing higher leve ls o f p r iva te 
inves tmen t and add i t iona l dono r support.

I t i s difficult to gauge social and poverty data over time as the analyses a re 
sparse and very weak. Ana lys is suggests, howeve r , tha t several years o f economic

Poverty i s concentrated in rural areas and i s higher among female-headed

The Oil Sector 

28. 
By 2012, i t i s expected that STP w i l l become an o i l producing nation with 
significant revenues. In 2001, STP and N i g e r i a reached agreement o n j o i n t exp lo ra t ion 
f o r o i l in waters c la imed by the two countries. In April 2003, the Jo in t Deve lopmen t 
Zone (JDZ), was opened f o r bids by in te rna t iona l f i r m s . The JDZ was divided i n t o 9 
b locks and negotiations o n b l o c k one we re f ina l ized in the f i rs t quarter o f 2005 f o r $123

the other 60 percent. A n ew r o u n d o f bidding was f ina l ized in la te 2004 o n 5 fu r the r 
b l o c k s but the awa rd o f the b l o c k s has n o t yet been made. 

29. 
The o i l era i s a key development opportunity for STP. Revenues f r o m o i l , gas 
and mining companies, in the f o r m o f taxes, royalties, signature bonuses and o the r 
payments shou ld be an impo r tan t engine f o r economic g r ow t h and soc ia l development. 
But, as experience f r o m other countries has shown, good governance and good economic 
management are c ruc ia l t o sustainable development. STP must f o l l o w th rough o n i t s 
comm i tmen t o f putting o i l revenues t o e f fec t ive use, while ba lanc ing the u s e o f non -

Box 1: The Petroleum Revenue Management L a w 

O n December 29,2004, President de Menezes o f STP signed i n t o l a w a Pe tro leum Revenue Management 
L a w that sets a h i g h in terna t iona l standard fo r con t ro l o f pe t ro leum revenues and transparency. The law , 
w h i c h was adopted unan imous ly by t h e Na t iona l Assembly in la te Novembe r 2004, details the r u l e s f o r 
the rece ip t and u s e o f the pe t ro leum funds to best s e r v e the coun try ’s l o n g t e r m economic development 
goals that inc lude p o v e r t y reduc t ion and good governance. These goals are based o n the Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy Paper o f the coun try . 

The l a w focuses o n crea t ing mechanisms to promo te transparency in the management o f o i l revenue. I t 
creates an o i l fund t o be held by an in terna t iona l cus tod ia l bank and outlines the year ly amounts o f the

Debt Sustainability and the Enhanced H IPC Initiative 

32. 
STP’s debt ratios to exports and Government revenues are among the 
highest in the world, reaching close to 1,000 percent. STP reached the Enhanced 
H P C I n i t i a t i v e D e c i s i o n Po in t in December 2000 and expects t o reach Comp le t ion P o i n t 
by September 2006. At the time o f H I P C D e c i s i o n Point, the debt r e l i e f t o be p rov ided 
unde r H I P C was estimated at US $ 9 7 m i l l i o n in end-NPV t e rm s . Since then, STP has 
rece ived i n t e r im r e l i e f f r o m IDA, the A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t Bank, the OPEC Fund and 
the Eu ropean Un iong . The latest D e b t Sus ta inab i l i ty Ana lys is (DSA) in Append ix 1 t o 
th is C A S indicates that the debt s i tua t ion has worsened compared t o the estimates made 
at D e c i s i o n Po in t . Assuming that STP reaches i t s Comp le t ion Po in t in September 2006, 
the D S A r e s u l t s ind ica te that the NPV o f debt t o exports ra t io after the full de l ive ry o f 
enhanced HIPC assistance w o u l d stand at 274 percent as o f end-2004, as compared w i th 
142 percent p ro jec ted in the dec is ion p o i n t document. 

33. 
Reaching H IPC Completion Point w i l l require maintaining a track record of 
compliance with 
the 
IMF’s planned PRGF program and a successful 
implementation of the PRSP, as w e l l as im p l em e n t i n g the social, f inanc ia l management 
and governance re fo rms l a i d ou t in the D e c i s i o n P o i n t document. The Government has 
progressed s tead i ly towa rds the imp lemen ta t ion o f those re fo rms during 2003-04. T h e 
first year progress repo r t o f the PRSP imp lemen ta t ion sha l l b e prepared in t im e f o r the 
H I P C C om p l e t i o n P o i n t boa rd date (expected September 2006) 

34. 
The updated PRSP includes an action plan in which ensuring debt 
sustainability i s part of the strategy. In this regard, the Government created in la te 
2003 an ex tema l debt management unit at the Cen t ra l Bank. The unit s t i l l needs t o 
develop i t s ana ly t ica l capacity and establish systems f o r the regu la r d issem ina t ion o f debt

i t s debt and t o build capacity in debt management. 

H. Social Sectors

Since its independence from Portugal in 1975 and during the 1980s’ STP had 
among the better social indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. E x t em a l terms o f trade 
shocks, dec l in ing investment in the soc ia l sectors, de te r io ra t ing economic pe r fo rmance 
and weak capacity l e d t o a wo rsen ing o f the socio-economic cond i t ions o f the popu la t ion . 
Bas ic soc ia l services deteriorated s ign i f ican t ly , lead ing t o de te r io ra t ion in hea l th and 
education outcomes. There was a substantial decrease in p u b l i c spending f o r the soc ia l 
sectors in the mid-1 990s but spending leve ls have recove red since then. A l t h o u g h p u b l i c 
expenditure o n hea l th and education i s r e l a t i v e l y high - accoun t ing f o r about 3 0 percent 
o f expenditure - i t i s m a r k e d by la rge ine f f ic ienc ies . Performance o f the sectors i s poor, 
capac i ty limited and access t o services rema ins l o w . 

Recently, Pans Club rescheduling has met with some delays due to hesitation on the part o f some members on rescheduling 
until the EMF program i s approved by its Board.

Today, social indicators are weak. I t i s estimated that 15 percent o f ch i ld ren 
unde r f i v e are underweight, 29 percent are stunted and 4 percent are wasted. Infant and 
c h i l d m o r t a l i t y rates are high at 75 (out o f 1,000) and 95 (out o f 1,000) respectively. L i f e 
expectancy i s 66 years and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y i s estimated t o b e 122 p e r 100,000 l i v e

p o o r l y func t ion ing and o f l o w qua l i ty . Schoo l d rop -ou t rates and repe t i t ion rates are 
high, ava i lab i l i ty o f teachers and teaching materials i s scarce and education outcomes are 
dismal. The delivery o f social services i s constrained by v e r y l i m i t e d Government 
capac i ty t o p l a n and implement social strategies and p rog rams and a weak incen t ive

Box 2: Reach ing the MDGs in the H e a l t h and Educa t ion Sectors 
Ana lys is o f the po ten t ia l o f STP reach ing the health Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs) suggests 
that they are at least p a r t i a l l y achievable: 

The f irs t MDG i s t o reduce c h i l d m o r t a l i t y by two- th irds by 2015, s ign i fy ing the achievement o f 
a drop in in fan t m o r t a l i t y f r o m 75 per 1,000 l ive births (ptlb) in 2002 t o 30 ptlb in 2015; t o 
achievement o f a d rop in m o r t a l i t y among ch i ld ren under f i v e f r o m 95 ptlb t o 38 p t lb , and t o 
increase measles vacc ina t ion coverage f r o m 69 percent t o 100 percent in t h e same per iod . Based 
o n the progress achieved towa rd t h e f i r s t tw o ind ica tors over t h e past decade (a decline in 
m o r t a l i t y o f o n l y 16.9 percent), the MDG goa l i s l ike ly ou t o f reach. The vacc ina t ion rate, 
however, i s already high and full coverage i s achievable by 2015. 
The second MDG goa l i s t o imp rove ma terna l h e a l t h t o reduce by three-quarters, be tween 1990

The f i n a l hea l th MDG goa l i s t o ha l t by 2015 and t o beg in revers ing the spread o f H I V / A I D S . 
The incidence in STP o f H I V / A I D S i s s t i l l re la t ive ly low , presenting the coun t ry w i t h a w i n d ow

invo lvemen t o f a l l other sectors. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the N a t i o n a l A I D S Strategic P l a n shou ld be 
pursued as a ma t ter o f na t iona l urgency. 

As regards t h e education MDGs, the status i s the f o l l ow i n g : 

The goa l f o r un iversa l p r im a r y education by 2015, also re f lec ted in the PRSP goals re la ted t o

There does n o t appear t o b e serious gender gaps in access t o education. En ro l lmen t rates f o r 
boys and g ir ls are equa l at the p r im a r y and secondary levels but a larger p r o p o r t i o n o f g i r ls than

and, in a l l l e v e l s o f education, n o la ter than 2015 . The educational system w i l l need t o establish 
partnerships w i t h c i v i l society and commun i t ies t o achieve t h i s goal.

Education. The education sector i s characterized by a weak structure and 
organization w h i c h nega t ive ly impacts o n the qua l i ty and e f f ic iency o f education. 
A lm o s t one third o f p r im a r y schools operate under a t r i p l e shift system w h i c h means that 
average class t im e i s severely curtailed. The sector emp loys the largest group in the c i v i l 
service but the a b i l i t y o f the M i n i s t r y o f Educa t ion t o use these human resources cost- 
e f fec t ive ly i s hampered by i t s weak capacity f o r personnel planning and management, 
supe rv is ion o f teachers and m o n i t o r i n g resource use. Teachers are de-motivated and 
un t ra ined with the i r salaries corresponding t o a mere 1.5 times the GDP pe r capita, and 
n o career development p a t h in place. 

38 . 
The Ten Year Education Strategy (2003-2013) covers the entire sector and 
emphasizes fou r b road areas f o r action: (i) l a y i n g the founda t ion f o r a better managed and 
integrated six-years p r im a r y education system and f o r the p r om o t i o n o f adult l i te racy 
programs; (ii) im p r o v i n g access t o education irrespective o f gender o r income level;

management o f the system; and (iv) im p r o v i n g service de l ive ry th rough p o l i c y and 
ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms and capacity building. T o address these goals, the PRSP proposes t o 
increase the share o f education in the budget and the re la t ive budgetary a l loca t ion f o r 
p r im a r y education. This in turn w i l l he lp increase and equip classrooms in order t o phase 
ou t two and th ree -sh i f t teaching, reduce reg iona l and income disparities, re ta in m o r e 
teachers th rough be t te r t r a i n i n g and higher salaries and decentralize the education system. 

39. Health. As previously mentioned, health indicators have worsened in the 
1990s with increases in child and adult mortality and child morbidity. Poo r sanitary 
conditions, ma lnu t r i t ion , weak sector management and inadequate a t ten t ion t o p r im a r y 
healthcare are the m a j o r factors con t r ibu t ing t o the wo rsen ing hea l th outcomes. At 
around 80 percent, general vacc ina t ion coverage i s good compared t o o the r countries in 
the r e g i o n but the na t iona l average hides inequ i t ies among districts. M a l a r i a i s the m a i n 
p u b l i c hea l th p r o b l em in the country, i s responsible f o r 65 percent o f a l l hosp i ta l iza t ions 
o f ch i ld ren under 5 and i s the m a j o r cause o f death, espec ia l ly among ch i ld ren unde r 5 
years o f age. STP’s p o p u l a t i o n has one o f the highest rates o f bed ne t u s e in Sub-Saharan 
A f r i c a but o n l y about 45 percent o f babies l e s s than 6 mon ths o f age sleep unde r a 
mosqu i to ne t and o n l y 53 percent o f the nets are impregnated. 

40. 
The health system i s characterized by inequities in availability and access to 
health services, the l a c k o f q u a l i f i e d s t a f f and weak supe rv is ion and m o n i t o r i n g o f the 
system. The M i n i s t r y o f H e a l t h has limited management capac i ty in terms o f planning, 
implementation, m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation. S t a f f capac i ty i s ex t reme ly l o w due t o l a c k 
o f t ra in ing and career structures, as well as an ove ra l l shortage o f staff. L o w salaries, 
scarce data a v a i l a b i l i t y and p o o r u t i l i z a t i o n o f f inanc ia l resources comp le te the d i re 
p ic tu re , To achieve the hea l th goals, the PRSP envisages an increase in the budgetary 
a l loca t ion f o r the hea l th sector. The strategy focuses o n res t ruc tu r ing o f basic hea l th 
services, refocusing care o n preventive approaches and o n the diseases w i th the highest

Governance and Capacity 

46. 
The key constraints facing STP in implementing its reform program stem 
from weak institutional capacity, governance issues, and lack o f skilled human 
resources. W h i l e successive Governments have expressed their comm i tmen t t o r e f o rm 
in general, e f fec t ive and t im e l y imp lemen ta t ion o f measures has suffered f r o m 
insu f f ic ien t techn ica l and f inanc ia l assistance and lack o f p o l i t i c a l w i l l in specific r e f o rm 
areas such as c i v i l service and land re fo rm . Governance issues are a source o f concern 
with the a r r i v a l o f o i l signature bonuses and the future o i l era. A s a consequence, 
im p r o v i n g governance must b e at the fo re f ron t o f the p o v e r t y reduc t ion agenda and 
concerted e f fo r ts are needed t o build strong ins t i tu t ions t o prepare f o r the o i l era. 

47. 
The PRSP recognizes that good governance has a significant impact on 
poverty reduction. 
I t stresses the need t o consolidate the r u l e o f law, i n c l u d i n g 
cons t i tu t iona l reforms t o remove po ten t ia l sources o f c o n f l i c t among the branches o f the 
government. O the r measures considered inc lude bas ing the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly o n 
p ropo r t iona l representation, r e f o rm i n g and re in fo rc ing the j u d i c i a r y by t ra in ing judges 
and c i v i l servants in mode rn law , upda t ing the lega l f ramewo rk and empowe r ing l a w 
enforcement. The PRSP envisages a reorganized p u b l i c sector t o increase i t s e f f ic iency 
and transparency th rough : (i) e l im ina t ing ove r lapp ing func t ions be tween agencies; 
(ii) decen t ra l iz ing and strengthening l o c a l government structures; (iii) w i t h - d r aw i n g f r o m 
p roduc t ive activities; and (iv) r e f o rm i n g the c i v i l service t o enhance the p r o v i s i o n o f 
p u b l i c services. 

48. On budgetary procedures, capacity i s being strengthened in order to improve 
public expenditure management, with m o r e a p r i o r i and pos te r io r i checks. With the 
support o f the IMF, W o r l d B a n k and others, the Gove rnmen t i s m o v i n g ahead with 
re fo rms t o im p r o v e procurement, inven to ry and accoun t ing practices o f government 
assets, receipts and expenses. 
In this regard, the Gove rnmen t w i l l sho r t ly b e g i n the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f an integrated budge ta ry and treasury i n f o rm a t i o n system. Ano the r key 
ac t ion i s the strengthening o f the in te rna l and external aud i t o f gove rnmen t agencies by 
empowe r ing the A u d i t o r General’s O f f ice . The accoun t ing t r ibuna l started i t s ac t iv i t ies 
in July 2003. In tax adm in is t ra t ion and collection, better coope ra t ion and an i n f o rm a t i o n 
sharing system among different directorates and au tho r i t ies have l e d t o imp rovemen ts in 
taxpayer reg is t ra t ion and tax collections. E f f o r t s con t inue t o reo r ien t p u b l i c expenditure 
towa rd the education and hea l th sectors in the con tex t o f the PRSP, and the authorities 
con t inue t o ensure that a l l government f inanc ia l operations, i n c l u d i n g PRSP-related 
spending, are within a s ing le budget framework. T h e Gove rnmen t i s r e f o rm i n g the 
p rog ramm ing and imp lemen ta t ion process o f the PRSP by c rea t ing a PRSP unit within 
the Ministry o f Planning and Finance. N o tw i t h s t a n d i n g t h i s progress, the ove ra l l budget 
framework needs t o be fu r the r strengthened, and the capac i ty o f key m in is t r ies t o 
formulate programs and their associated budgets needs t o b e imp roved . Budget 
execu t ion i s n o t we l l coordinated, with nume rous steps i n v o l v e d in expenditure approval, 
while con t ro l remains weak.

49. 
I n April 2004, an update of the HIPC-AAP revealed that while some progress 
has been made, much more work remains to be done. O n the pos i t ive side, the budget 
fo rmu la t ion i s exhaustive; unified under one budge ta ry system, with l i t t l e re l iance t o 
extra-budgetary processes; and captures app rox ima te ly 9 0 percent o f external support. 
In te rna l arrears are usua l ly cleared within a few weeks. Regu la r in te rna l repo r t ing o f 
budget execu t ion and debt f o l l ow up i s adequate and the yearly books are closed within 
t w o mon ths o f the end o f the f isca l year. A s regards w o r k t o b e done, the H PC - A A P 
suggests that the budget needs t o b e updated t o the mode rn nomenclature system and 
adapt a multi-year approach. A l s o budget execu t ion i s weak: in 2002, i t was 23.2 percent 
o f budge t programmed. Execu t ion i s n o t well coordinated among m in is t r ies , with 
numerous s teps i n v o l v e d in expenditure approval, weak accounting practices (no doub le 
en t ry accounting), and weak a p r i o r i and pos te r io r i controls. Ex te rna l repo r t ing o f budge t 
execu t ion t o the N a t i o n a l Assemb ly 
i s s t i l l unava i lab le and p o v e r t y reduc t ion 
expenditures are n o t yet iden t i f iab le . 

50. Overall, despite some progress, the implementation of the reform program 
has been slow paced in some areas while uneven in others due t o p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty , 
l a c k o f p o l i t i c a l w i l l and l o w ins t i tu t iona l capacity. Re fo rms in a l l areas we re s lowed by 
the d rawn -ou t p o l i t i c a l in-fighting, s ix reshu f f les o r changes in governments be tween 
September 2001 and September 2004 and the consequent general unce r ta in ty .

Productive Sectors 

51. 
Agriculture represented 19 percent of GDP in 2003 with cocoa production as 
the main economic activity. P roduc t ion o f cocoa has been inc reas ing since 2000 as 
in te rna t iona l cocoa p r ices have risen. T h e p o s i t i v e p r i c e t rend has reversed somewhat the 
dec l ine in the cocoa sector w h i c h hampered the economy in the 1990s. 
T h e 
Government’s p rog ram in r u r a l development concentrates o n d i v e r s i f y i n g ag r icu l tu re 
towa rds other crops and p r om o t i n g expo r t linkages. Reduc t ion o f the f o o d im p o r t b i l l i s

supp l ied loca l ly . A m a j o r l a n d r e f o rm p rog ram has been unde rway since 1993, with 
support in the early years f r o m the W o r l d Bank . I t s ob jec t ive i s t o distribute l a n d f r o m 
former state p lan ta t ions t o small-scale farmers in an attempt t o increase and d i v e r s i f y 
ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i o n and increase equity. Howeve r , sma l lho lde r farmers have been 
constrained by a l a c k o f credit, extension services and t ra in ing and by p o o r access t o 
ma rke ts as a resu l t o f inadequate r o a d transport. Fishing licenses have become the 
coun t ry ’s largest source o f fo re ign exchange after cocoa. A three-year f i s h i n g agreement 
was signed with the EU in January 2002 f o r about US$2 .5 m i l l i o n . 

52. 
Increasing labor productivity and diversifying income-generating activities, 
especially in rural areas, i s critical for reducing poverty. The Government’s strategy 
emphasizes needed imp rovemen ts in bas ic roads and ma rke t ing in f ras t ruc tu re f o r 
ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc ts and extension services, the development o f downs t ream agro- 
indus t r ia l ac t iv i t ies as w e l l as tou r ism and fishing ne two rks in the archipelago. These 
actions are n o t w e l l costed o r p r i o r i t i z e d in the PRSP so that their impac t o n g r ow t h and 
p o v e r t y c o u l d b e assessed.

53. 
Industry accounts for 18 percent of GDP but the manufacturing sector i s 
limited to some small factories i n v o l v e d in the agro-industrial sector and other light 
indus t r ia l activities. P r iva t iza t ion o f state companies has s l ow l y proceeded with the 
telecoms company, the state a i r l ine and the na t iona l f u e l company h a v i n g p r iva te cap i ta l

Services - predominantly public administration, tourism and commerce - 
contribute the remaining 63 percent o f GDP. The tou r ism po ten t ia l l i e s in the islands’ 
great na tu ra l beauty, unspo i led beaches, endemic bird species and o l d p lan ta t ion houses. 
Howeve r , tourists are deterred by the islands’ isolation, high ma la r ia rates and p o o r a i r 
access with high a i r fares. T h e Government i s trying t o p romo te eco - tou r ism and some

Box 4: Gender Issues in Sao Tome and Principe 

In June 2004, the Governmen t and the B a n k f ina l ized a Coun t ry Gender Assessment f o r S T P (Report No . 29300- 
STP). T h i s repor t h igh l igh ted that STP has a d is t inc t ive gender p r o f i l e characterized by a d icho tomy be tween the 
o f f ic ia l ly-accep ted gender equa l i ty l aw s and po l ic ies and the actual gender-associated socio-economic status. W h i l e 
gender equa l i ty i s emphasized in the cons t i tu t ion and in the lega l framework , actual prac t ice i s o f ten con trad ic tory . 
A high p ropo r t ion o f households are headed b y women w h o are m o s t l y e i ther s ing le o r l i v i n g in “free un ion” . These 
women are four t imes mo re l i k e l y as m e n to be i l l i tera te . O n the whole, female-headed households tend to b e larger, 
poorer and with lowe r per cap i ta consump t ion than male-headed households. Women’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in dec is ion 
m a k i n g at the loca l leve ls i s marginal and cu l tu ra l attitudes relegate women t o mo re t rad i t iona l roles. W om e n are 
con f ined t o a limited set o f econom ic ac t iv i t ies - usua l ly a f o r m o f se l f-emp loymen t in the i n f o rm a l sector - and they 
have limited access t o p roduc t ive resources. W om e n cons t i tu te the largest segment o f the econom ica l ly inac t ive 
popu la t ion . Am o n g those w h o are econom ica l ly active, women are tw i c e as likely as m e n t o be unemp loyed ; 
spec i f ica l ly a quarter o f women in the labo r force are unemp loyed compared t o ten percent f o r men. Em p l o y e d 
women tend to be concentrated in the i n f o rm a l sector, m a i n l y in commerce and services, while m e n a re l i k e l y t o be 
emp loyed as p u b l i c or p r iva te sector salaried workers. There i s increas ing evidence t o ind ica te tha t domestic v io lence 
rates against women and ch i ld ren are h i g h . 

O n the pos i t ive side, however, several women occupy h igh - leve l dec is ion-mak ing pos i t ions at the na t iona l level, there 
does n o t appear to be any gender gaps in access t o education and hea l th and there i s an o f f i c i a l discourse tha t 
espouses gender equa l i ty . En ro l lmen t rates f o r boys and girls are equal at the primary and secondary leve ls but a 
larger p ropo r t ion o f g i r ls than boys drops ou t . W h i l e there are gaps in l i te racy rates be tween m e n and women in o lder 
age groups, the gap i s r a p i d l y c los ing in younger generations. In terms o f powe r and dec is ion mak ing , women had, o r 
con t inue to have, a s ign i f ican t share at the h ighes t leve ls o f Governmen t . The prev ious P r ime Minister was a woman, 
the current Govemo r o f the Cen tra l B a n k i s a woman, women have headed the M i n i s t r i e s o f P lann ing and Finance, 
Health, Fo re ign Affairs, Education, Cu l tu re and Justice, and women h o l d some senior pres iden t ia l adv iso ry pos i t ions . 
Desp i te this good representation at the h ighes t p o l i t i c a l leve l , the share o f women in the p o l i t i c a l process and 
dec is ion-mak ing i s ve ry l im i t e d at the l ow e r levels. Hence, w h i l e there i s a clear comm i tmen t towards gender 
equa l i ty at the h igher leve ls o f Government, m o r e e f f o r t i s needed t o expand oppor tun i t ies f o r women ’s pa r t ic ipa t ion 
at other levels. 

A s pa r t o f the prepara t ion o f the Coun t ry Gender Assessment, a na t iona l wo rkshop was h e l d in January 2004 in STP 
to discuss gender issues. The main recommenda t ions were to : (i) adopt an in tegra ted na t iona l approach to gender 
issues by deve lop ing a b o d y o f gender-sensitive po l ic ies tha t w o u l d p r o v i d e f o r access t o in fo rma t ion , awareness- 
ra is ing and leg is la t ive re fo rm ; (ii) strengthen ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty t o integrate gender issues i n t o deve lopmen t 
programs and policies; (iii) establish advocacy, soc ia l mob i l iza t ion , in forma t ion , educa t ion and commun ica t ion 
programs o n gender and deve lopmen t issues; and (iv) upda te ex is t ing leg is la t ion and adopt n e w leg is la t ion tha t i s

As the CAS Completion Report in Annex 11 describes, the Bank rebuilt both 
its knowledge base of STP and its relationship with the Government and other 
development actors during the CAS period. The Bank ac t ive ly pursued the p o l i c y 
dialogue in the con tex t o f PRSP p repa ra t ion and H I P C re l ie f , imp lemen ted and prepared

robus t and the Bank ’s p rog ram was inc reas ing ly broadened as the d ia logue deepened 
with Gove rnmen t .

As regards lending operations, the CAS outlined that activities would remain 
limited to the existing portfolio o f t w o projects and two new projects - the Pub l ic 
Resource Managemen t C red i t (PRMC ) and a suppo r t ing P u b l i c Resource Management 
Techn ica l Assistance P ro jec t (PRM -TA ) , w h i c h we re b o t h approved at the t im e o f the

I n the case of the Health and Education Project, the ICR rated the project’s 
outcome, Bank performance and Borrower performance as Satisfactory but OED 
rated each o f these as Unsatisfactory. The analysis o f the p ro jec t was that i t was p o o r l y 
designed, o v e r l y complex, and did n o t take capacity constraints su f f ic ien t ly i n t o account. 
S im i l a r t o the A g r i c u l t u r e Project, the H e a l t h and Educa t ion P ro jec t was approved in 
FY92. The p ro jec t su f fe red f r o m the frequent changes in government and re l iance o n

with m iss ions l a c k i n g the specialists needed t o cover the range o f ac t iv i t ies included.

During the p e r i o d cove red by the CAS , the B a n k imp lemen ted fully the P R M C 
(w h i c h closed in June 2004) and the P R M - T A (w h i c h closed in December 2004). 

61. 
The PRMC was designed as a quick-disbursing operation to fill the financing 
gap for the period 2000-01, and also provided support to the implementation of 
economic reforms. The p ro jec t supported economic re fo rms with the f o l l ow i n g 
objectives: (i) im p r o v e domestic resource mob i l iza t ion ; (ii) strengthen p u b l i c expenditure 
management; and (iii) con t inue imp lemen ta t ion o f the p u b l i c enterprise r e f o rm program. 
The P R M C was imp lemen ted in l i n e with the IMF’s S t a f f M o n i t o r e d P rog ram and a imed 
t o h e l p p ro tec t soc ia l sector expenditures. The I C R f o r the P R M C re f lec ts a m i x e d reco rd

ins t i tu t iona l development modest, and Bank and bo r rowe r pe r fo rmance unsatisfactory 
(OED agreed with these ratings). T h e I C R highlights that the P R M C was w i d e ranging 
and ove r ly ambitious. T h e fast-disbursing nature o f the ope ra t ion ove r o n l y two years 
was too q u i c k f o r the scope o f re fo rms proposed. W h i l e the Gove rnmen t progressed o n

with the imp lemen ta t ion o f tax and tariff r e f o rm measures and the p ro tec t ion o f hea l th

A key conclusion from the experience in STP under the CAS and previous 
operations i s that project support may not be the most effective instrument to 
deliver Bank financing t o assist the coun t ry in mee t ing i t s development challenges. 
Deve lopmen t p o l i c y operations (Le,, budget support) - coup led with appropriate capac i ty 
building activities, techn ica l assistance, analysis, and p o l i c y d ia logue - shou ld be 
considered as a p o t e n t i a l l y m o r e e f fec t ive and e f f ic ien t w a y o f de l ive r ing the Bank’s

D. Assistance Strategy 

71. 
The CAS builds on the experience and 
lessons 
learned from the 
implementation of the m o l - 0 5 CAS and sets ou t a strategy tha t consolidates and 
deepens those ac t iv i t ies already undertaken. T h e tw o p r i n c i p a l ob jec t ives o f the Bank’s 
strategy are: 

(i) t o support the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP and strengthen t h e areas where 
the PRSP needs t o b e imp roved , as h i g h l i g h t e d in the JSAN . 

- 23 - 

(ii) t o p rov ide assistance to STP t o ensure that i t i s su f f ic ien t ly prepared t o 
m a x im i z e the benefits o f fbture o i l revenues. 

72. 
The strategy draws f r o m the wider base o f E S W and AAA that has been 
conducted since the last C A S (the CEM , Pove r ty Diagnostic, Gender Assessment and 
d ra f t DT IS ) . 
I t focuses o n just a few selected areas o f in te rven t ion t o m a x im i z e the 
Bank ’s im p a c t and t o ensure complementarity with other development  partner^'^. This 
se lec t iv i ty i s d ic ta ted by the limited IDA f inanc ia l envelope w h i c h i s available f o r STP 
and by the Bank ’s in te rna l administrative constraints w h i c h a l l ow f o r o n l y a re la t ive ly 
sma l l number o f non - lend ing activities t o be conducted in a coun t ry o f STP’s size14. 

Box 7: Participatory CAS Process 

As noted previously, the CAS i s specifically linked to the PRSP and i s “the Bank’s implementation arm” o f the 
PRSP: in this regard, i t benefits from the participatory process o f the PRSP. T h e CAS team conducted 
preliminary discussions with the Government in December 2004 about the possible strategic direction o f the CAS 
and the overall lending envelope that could be expected. 

T h e CAS team visited Sao Tome in early Apr i l 2005 to carry out consultations w i th Government officials, their 
advisors and staff, as well as w i th representatives o f labor unions, members o f the National Assembly, the 
Federation o f NGOs (FONG), representatives from the Chamber o f Commerce and representatives o f donors and 
international agencies (UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, European Commission, Embassies o f Portugal and Brazil). T h e 
team coordinated very closely w i th a mission from the African Development Bank (AfDB) which was in Sao 
Tome at the same time to discuss their organization’s draft assistance strategy for 2005-2009. T h e team held 
fruitful and frank exchanges with a l l these actors which allowed fo r a better understanding o f the development 
challenges facing Sao Tome and Principe as well as the r o l e o f the World Bank in the country. 

There was general agreement that the World Bank’s focus on building institutional and human resource capacity 
i s critically important. Stakeholders also agreed that the Bank should continue to focus on the sectors where i t i s 
already active although there were demands for broadening the Bank’s financial assistance to cover non-oil 
productive sectors. T h e CAS team emphasized that the proposed budget support operations could assist in 
carrying out needed reforms and interventions in productive sectors but that traditional investment projects in this 
regard would not be possible due to the limited financing envelope available. Moreover, the Bank would continue 
to target its analytical support and policy dialogue on addressing the constraints facing the productive sector 
through identifying necessary reforms for trade facilitation, private sector development and economic 
diversification. Implementation o f the recommendations contained in the Country Economic Memorandum, as 
well as follow-up on the analysis o f the on-going Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, w i l l be especially critical in 
this regard. In particular, there was a strong demand for the Bank and other donors to help with more training and 
more capacity building specifically targeted at income-generating activities to permit a wider set o f employment 
options for the population. T h e CAS team emphasized the goal o f the Bank to enhance its cooperation with other 
donors which a r e active in these sectors. 

As the Bank program does not bring significant I D A resources to the country, the CAS consultations resulted in a 
greater degree o f understanding and ownership o f both the lending and non-lending support which the Bank can 
provide to S T P . Even after o i l revenues come on stream, the Government has indicated that i t i s interested in 
having the Bank play an advisory role i n regard to helping the country successfully manage its o i l revenue. 

73. 
Above all, the strategy remains tightly focused, building u p o n on -go ing 
ac t iv i t ies and enhancing and deepening the strategy l a i d ou t in the p rev ious CAS . In this 
regard, the Bank ’s support w i l l be tw o - f o l d :

An over-riding theme of the strategy i s that the Bank w i l l assist the 
Government to “scale-up” for the future e ra when i t w i l l have high levels of its own 
resources from o i l (as p rev ious ly men t ioned in footnote 3, STP i s expected to rema in an 
IDA b o r r ow e r f o r the C A S period). As part o f this transition, the strategy proposes t o 
p r o v i d e f inanc ia l support th rough Deve lopmen t P o l i c y operations in support o f PRSP 
imp lemen ta t ion , with a view t o preparing the g round f o r manag ing future o i l revenues 
i n t o the budget. T h i s Deve lopmen t P o l i c y L e n d i n g (DPL) w o u l d de l ive r a f o rm o f 
annually-negotiated budge t support t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP, starting in FY 0 7 . 
This w o u l d n o t be a mu l t i -yea r r o l l i n g comm i tmen t that i s usua l ly associated with the 
Bank’s PRSCs since the mac ro t rack reco rd isn’t ye t su f f ic ien t t o justify a med ium - te rm 
comm i tmen t . Rather, i t w o u l d b e a f o r m o f annua l ly - rev iewed f inanc ing that i s de l ive red 
t o support the PRSP p rog ram . T h i s w o u l d rep resen t a t r u e n e w strategic d i rec t ion fo r the 
B a n k p r o g r am w h i c h w o u l d b e t r igge red by sound macroeconomic management and 
progress in p u b l i c finance and o i l management. 

75. 
DPLs are justified as an effective way to deliver necessary financial support 
to the PRSP. G i v e n the sma l l expo r t base o f STP with a concen t ra t ion o n cocoa receipts 
and the unce r ta in ty re la ted t o o i l prospects, the economy i s highly vulnerable t o 
exogenous shocks. E v e n after STP reaches H I P C C om p l e t i o n Point, the coun t ry w i l l 
likely face a s ign i f ican t f inanc ing gap until o i l revenues become available, during w h i c h 
t im e the B a n k w i l l con t inue t o be an impo r tan t partner. A l t h o u g h the share o f STP in the 
signature bonus f o r the first b l o c k i s in the o rde r o f US$49 m i l l i o n , the actual amount 
available t o the 2005 budget i s o n l y $13 m i l l i o n (see foo tno te 8). Mo reove r , the amount 
o f funds available f r o m other o i l bonus signatures i s s t i l l uncertain, as we l l as the timing 
o f the ava i lab i l i ty o f the funds. 
I t is , therefore, impo r tan t that the Bank consider 
p r o v i d i n g some f o r m o f qu ick d isbu rs ing fimding that w i l l a l l ow f o r t im e l y support t o the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP and w i l l strengthen the ove ra l l budge ta ry f ramewo rk as 
preparation f o r the a r r i v a l o f o i l revenues. 

76. 
The DPLs would l ike ly be delivered in FY07 as the current framework in 
STP i s not conducive f o r providing immediate budgetary support f o r the f o l l ow i n g 
m a i n reasons: (i) there i s a need t o strengthen the ove ra l l strategy ou t l ined in the PRSP, 
pa r t icu la r ly t o prepare annual p r i o r i t y ac t ion programs; (ii) a med ium - te rm p rog ram f o r

identify a clear set o f mon i to rab le ind ica to rs a round w h i c h fu tu re budge ta ry support

com ing 12-18 mon ths w i l l be t o h e l p STP prepare the necessary f ramewo rk fo r rece iv ing 
budget support f r o m the B a n k and other donors. 
In the immed ia te future, i t w i l l be 
necessary t o w o r k c lose ly with the Gove rnmen t and other development actors in STP t o 
ou t l ine an annual p r i o r i t y ac t ion p r o g r am f o r the PRSP and i d e n t i f y a set o f mon i to rab le 
indicators against w h i c h budge ta ry support c o u l d b e aligned. This w o r k w o u l d b e ca r r ied 
ou t as pa r t o f the o v e r a l l support t o strengthening the PRSP and progress made o n this 
front c o u l d b e assessed as pa r t o f p repa r ing the A n n u a l PRSP Progress Repo r t (expected 
in April 2006).

77. 
I n addition to support for PRSP strengthening, the Bank w i l l provide 
analytic support and technical assistance to the Government for outlining a 
medium-term program for strengthening the fiduciary framework. An Integrated 
F i d u c i a r y Assessment w i l l b e launched in F Y 0 6 f o r de l ive ry in ea r ly FY 0 7 . Areas o f 
concem f o r this assessment w i l l be the f o l l ow i n g : (i) the budget elaboration process,

DPLs w i l l b e l i n k e d t o progress o n this front. 

78. While i t i s too early to confirm what exact reform measures the DPLs would 
support, i t i s l i k e l y that they w i l l b e linked t o the sequential imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
u n d e r l y i n g re fo rms f o r manag ing the h t u r e o i l i n f l o w s and t o other c r i t i c a l issues such as

DPLs w o u l d con t r ibu te t o mee t ing the expectations o f the p o p u l a t i o n during the t rans i t ion 
p e r i o d t o an o i l economy. 

79. 
I n the nearer-term, i.e. in FY06, the Bank w i l l consider delivering additional

This f inanc ing w o u l d b e re la t ive ly sma l l - n o m o r e than US$1.5 m i l l i o n - and w o u l d

The country financing parameters fo r STP have been prepared and agreed 
upon with the Government (see Annex 10). As p rev ious ly men t ioned in this CAS , 

- 2 8 - 

domestic resources are cu r ren t ly limited and the Government’s budge t i s highly 
dependent o n fo re ign fbnds. Neve r the less , with respect t o cost sharing agreements, as a 
s i g n o f the Government’s comm i tmen t t o i t s development p rog ram (as set ou t in i t s 
PRSP), the Gove rnmen t and Bank agreed that a minimum B o r r ow e r cost sharing o f 10 
percent-which 
has been the n o r m fo r past B a n k projects in STP-would b e maintained. 
Dec is ions rega rd ing the actual cost-sharing percentage under i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec ts w o u l d

g ran ts and recipient-executed t r u s t funds. 

Box 10: Donor Coordination and International Assistance 

S T P has traditionally benefited from one o f the largest amounts o f aid per capita in the world - equivalent to 
U S 1 6 6 per capita in 2002. According to the OECD, net official development assistance to STP reached a peak o f 
US$84 m i l l ion in 1995 but f e l l to about U S 2 5 m i l l ion in 2002 due to the poor quality o f macroeconomic 
management in the 1990s. T h e 2000 Round Table meeting led to pledges o f assistance o f US$49 million, o f which 
US$35 m i l l ion was disbursed. Given the prospects for increases in revenues from o i l , the currently high levels o f 
grants from donors (compared to other low income countries), amounting to about 37 percent o f GDP in 2001 and 
27 percent o f GDP i s 2002, may not be available in the future to the same extent. Nevertheless, i t i s critical for 
STP to maintain donor support un t i l the start o f o i l production. 

Donors’ programs in S T P are poorly coordinated by Government. T h i s situation i s exacerbated b y weak absorptive 
and management capacity in the country. T h e Government aims to improve donor coordination through ensuring 
that activities are a l l aligned to the PRSP and a r e harmonized to the extent possible (the Governance Capacity 
Building project provides specific financial support to this aim). T h e Govemment has requested the Bank to play a 
role in leveraging the assistance of other donors and provide policy and programmatic leadership in some areas, 
notably the social sectors and the o i l sector. 

In order to mobilize better the donor community, the UNDP and the Bank have agreed to work closely together 
with Govemment on organizing a Round Table meeting around the PRSP (the meeting i s tentatively scheduled for 
Fall 2005). T h e PRSP provides an excellent opportunity for more donors to become active in S T P and for existing 
donors to increase their support around the comprehensive PRSP framework. Greater donor dialogue and 
coordination w i l l be necessary between now and the HIPC Completion Point (expected in Ap r i l 2006). 

T h e recognition by STP o f Taiwan in May 1997 has resulted in significant aid flows and the Taiwan aid program i s 
very visible in the country, financing road rehabilitation, hospitals and other infrastructure and supporting the 
social sectors, particularly malaria control. 

T h e impending o i l e ra has greatly increased western strategic interest in S T P - particularly from the U S . T h e U S 
military i s considering setting up a military base in Sao Tom6 and the US govemment i s funding feasibility studies 
on the construction o f a deep water port and the extension o f the international airport’s only runway. USA ID i s 
preparing a proposal to address issues o f governance and efficient u s e o f the petroleum revenues: this assistance 
w i l l l ike ly comprise technical advisors, specifically fo r the implementation o f a more efficient, performance driven 
budgetary process. 

Nigerian and Angolan interest in S T P has also increased. Nigeria i s strongly positioning itself to be the main actor 
in the country. 

T h e Columbia University Advisory Project, led b y Professor Jeffrey Sachs and funded by the Open Society 
Institute, has an active program in support of STP and played a key r o l e in the preparation o f the petroleum revenue 
management law. T h e objective of its work i s to support S T P to develop a new Consensus Plan o f Action fo r 
sustainable economic development, covering the period 2005-2010. T h e work has focused on informing and 
facilitating discussion b y suggesting a number o f specific public investments and policy changes on the part o f the 
Govemment, aiming to lay the foundation o f public services that are needed for a wide range o f private sector 
activity. T h e University o f Columbia intends to concentrate its support on the development o f the required 
secondary laws and regulations for the Oversight Committee and the Public Registry and Information Office 
considered in the petroleum revenue management Law. To this end the University o f Columbia w i l l be working 
with the recently appointed Petroleum Committee o f the National Assembly.

the B a n k w o u l d n o t enable the B a n k t o assist in the f inanc ing o f i n d i v i d u a l projects. 
Gove rnmen t tax revenue in 2003 constituted app rox ima te ly 20.5 percent o f GDP (or 4 1

IV . MANAGING R I S K S 

87. 
The main risk in the short-run comes from the potential mis-management of 
the influx of la rge amounts of money from the signature bonuses of the o i l contracts. 
As with many other countries w h i c h have experienced a huge w i n d f a l l o f revenues f r o m 
o i l , the risk i s that these revenues w i l l either b e p o o r l y spent o r w i l l be m i s d i r e c t e d t o 
expenditures outside the budgetary f ramewo rk . I n this context, governance i s k e y and the 
requ is i te “checks and balances” need t o be in p lace t o ensure that the popu la t ion can 
bene f i t . T h e successful preparation, adop t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f the Pe t ro leum 
Revenue Managemen t L a w m i t iga tes this risk and presents a r e a l oppo r tun i ty f o r STP t o 
show that i t can use i t s w i n d f a l l wisely. The Bank ’s Governance Capac i ty Building 
P ro jec t has the ob jec t ive o f strengthening governance t o off-set th is risk. Mo reove r , 
w h i l e the bonus i s substantial compared t o GDP, the Government i s aware tha t the 
amount and timing o f future bonuses cannot b e dictated o r relied u p o n and that i t w i l l s t i l l 
need t o show comm i tmen t t o the pe t ro leum revenue management l a w in order t o con t inue 
t o bene f i t f r o m dono r resources. 

88 . 
The revenues from the o i l signature bonuses potentially add to the political 
instability and increase social expectations. In other countries, o i l revenues have 
generated soc ia l and d is t r ibu t iona l r isks - such as increased con f l ic t , exc lus ion o f r u r a l 
areas, e l i te capture - w h i c h c o u l d also occur in STP and c o u l d b e exacerbated by the 
coun t ry ’s weak ins t i tu t ions . T h e Bank plans t o assist the Gove rnmen t in m i t i g a t i n g th is 
r i s k th rough ensuring that the revenue management f ramewo rk i s respected, that the 
signature bonuses are translated i n t o transparent budgetary allocations and by con t inued 
and concerted e f fo r ts t o build ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty and engage in dialogue/consultation 
with Gove rnmen t and c i v i l society. The Bank w i l l assist the Gove rnmen t in b e i n g 
transparent and open about i t s management o f the o i l economy th rough ensu r ing that 
consu l ta t ion and i n f o rm a t i o n d issem ina t ion a re broadened and deepened at b o t h the 
cen t ra l and l o c a l government levels. T h e PRSP consultations we re a p o s i t i v e experience 
and have created m om e n t um within the country; the Gove rnmen t w i l l be encouraged t o 
build o n this in the future. The B a n k i s also w o r k i n g c lose ly with the Gove rnmen t and 
other donors o n the e f f ic ien t imp lemen ta t ion o f the ID A - f i n a n c e d Soc ia l Sectors Support 
p ro jec t t o enhance the focus o n the ac tua l service d e l i v e r y o n the ground, thereby 
reduc ing the po ten t ia l f o r soc ia l ins tab i l i ty . 

8 9 . With respect to the implementation of the CAS, the main risks posed are the 
Government’s willingness to pursue reforms in a sustainable and consistent manner 
and i t s a b i l i t y t o m a i n t a i n a stable mac roeconom ic env i ronmen t and focus expenditures 
o n the p r i o r i t y sectors. The Bank w i l l w o r k c lose ly w i th the IMF and o the r development 
partners in o f f -se t t ing th is risk th rough concerted f inanc ia l and adv iso ry support t o ensure 
that there i s fo l low - th rough o n the r e f o r m p rog ram . The H I P C f ramewo rk w i l l also 

- 3 1 - 

fac i l i ta te d ia logue and adherence t o the re fo rms l a i d ou t therein. In the event that there 
are set-backs t o the r e f o rm efforts, the Bank ’s p rog ram w o u l d d rop t o a l o w case one. 
The B a n k w i l l con t inue t o pursue a frank and open dialogue with the Government about 
the impo r tance o f re fo rms in order t o increase investment and fo re ign aid. The C A S 
Progress Repo r t (planned f o r FY07) w o u l d p rov ide the oppo r tun i ty t o re -o r ien t the 
strategy in response t o such a situation. 

90 . 
Even when Government commitment i s present, weak capacity poses a 
significant risk to the successful implementation of the CAS. The Bank ’s Governance 
Capac i ty Building P ro jec t focuses o n a se t o f k e y re fo rms and measures that can 
in f luence the pe r fo rmance o f the p u b l i c sector and that can strengthen the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the PRSP and o f the Bank ’s support program. In the same way, the Soc ia l Sectors 
Support p ro jec t focuses o n strengthening capacity b o t h within Gove rnmen t and among 
non -Gove rnmen t actors w h i c h a re p l a y i n g a r o l e in service delivery. Furthermore, the 
Bank’s In teg ra ted F i d u c i a r y Assessment i s focused o n i d e n t i f y i n g the necessary re fo rms 
and capac i ty building ac t iv i t ies f o r manag ing f iduc ia ry r isks . The B a n k also i s 
coo rd ina t ing with other donors w h o are p r o v i d i n g ins t i tu t iona l development and capacity 
building support in this area. 

91 . 
There i s also a risk posed by the Government’s willingness to wo rk with the 
Bank given that the Bank i s only able to bring low levels o f financial assistance. I t i s 
possible that the Gove rnmen t m a y n o t consider that the f inanc ia l support unde r the C A S 
i s su f f ic ien t f o r them t o inves t in pu rsu ing a long - te rm d ia logue and re la t ionsh ip with the 
Bank . The B a n k p lans t o o f fse t this risk th rough ensuring greater understanding and 
engagement with the Gove rnmen t and stakeholders o n the C A S t o ensure that the Bank’s 
r o l e i s widely seen as bringing t o bear a variety o f other ins t rumen ts o f assistance w h i c h 
are non - f inanc ia l - such as p o l i c y advice, ESW , AAA, support t o PRSP implementation, 
IDF and GEF grants, etc. - and that the Bank has the a b i l i t y t o leverage other donors’ 
assistance. F ina l ly , STP has n o t yet reached Comp le t ion P o i n t in the Enhanced H I P C 
I n i t i a t i v e so there i s s t i l l an impo r tan t w i n d ow o f oppo r tun i ty in the sho r t - run fo r the 
B a n k t o p l a y a key ro le . 

92 . Although STP has made some efforts to diversify its exports, i t remains 
extremely vulnerable to exogenous shocks, especially t o f luc tua t ions in i t s t e rm s o f 
trade and dependence o n the ava i lab i l i ty o f fo re ign aid. In pa r t icu la r , the impac t o f the 
current high o i l p r ices and a poss ib le hrther decrease in the p r i c e o f cocoa present 
s ign i f ican t r i s k s . A s with any economy that i s h e a v i l y concentrated in the p r o d u c t i o n and 
export o f a few goods and services, there w i l l a lways be an element o f v u l n e r a b i l i t y t o 
negative w o r l d c omm o d i t y p r i c e changes. T o m i t iga te th is risk i t i s v i t a l t o con t inue the 
course o f prudent p u b l i c sector 
finance management, strengthening capac i ty and 
investing in h um a n and ins t i tu t iona l capital. G o o d govemance and an attractive 
investment c l ima te can h e l p in diversifying the economy ove r the l o n g run. The Bank’s 
p rog ram as l a i d ou t in this C A S concentrates o n these areas.

V. CONCLUSION 

93. 
The World Bank remains committed to supporting the economic and soc ia l 
development of STP. The key areas o f focus are t o assist the coun t ry in imp lemen t ing 
i t s PRSP and ach iev ing the H I P C Comp le t ion Po in t , ensure s t rong imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
on -go ing ID A - f i n a n c e d projects and f o l l ow - u p o n the recommendations o f the Bank’s 
ana ly t ica l w o r k . As regards future Bank activities, the focus i s on; (i) l a y i n g the 
g roundwo rk ove r the next 12-1 8 mon ths for, thereafter, de l ive r ing the Bank’s f inanc ia l 
assistance in the f o r m o f budgetary support; and (v) suppo r t ing the coun t ry t o prepare f o r 
the a r r i v a l o f o i l revenues and t o strengthen the ove ra l l macroeconomic and p u b l i c sector 
con tex t t o ensure that i t i s conducive f o r the p rope r and sustainable u s e o f fu tu re o i l 
revenues. W h i l e th is strategy i s challenging, i t i s u l t im a t e l y feasible so l o n g as the Bank 
and other development actors can sustain the i r invo lvemen t in STP and bring to bear 
concerted f inanc ia l and adv iso ry support. 

94. 
Beyond this CAS period, it i s expected that STP could have sufficient 
resources in-coming from o i l revenues and may not require financial assistance 
from IDA . T h e B a n k i s preparing f o r th is era by strengthening i t s c l ien t o r ien ta t ion and 
the r o l e o f the K n ow l e d g e Bank with the goa l o f rema in ing active in the coun t ry as 
partners o n fighting pove r ty .

Sao T om e and P r inc ipe (STP) i s one o f the mos t h e a v i l y indeb ted countries

US $ 2 9 4 m i l l i o n as o f end-1999, equivalent t o 6 2 4 percent o f GDP. At tha t time, the ne t 
present va lue (NPV) o f the stock o f debt amounted t o US $ 1 9 0 m i l l i o n , equivalent t o 
1,395 percent o f exports o f goods and services, w e l l above the H I P C th resho ld o f 150 
percent.

STP reached the dec is ion p o i n t under the Enhanced H I P C I n i t i a t i v e in December 
2000. A t o t a l assistance o f US $ 9 7 m i l l i o n in W V terms 26 was c omm i t t e d f o r STP t o

At the time o f the decision po in t , STP was expected t o reach the comp le t ion p o i n t 
unde r the Enhanced H I P C I n i t i a t i v e in 2003, but d i f f icu l t ies in imp lemen t ing a stable 
mac roeconom ic p rog ram have set back the imp lemen ta t ion o f the pove r ty reduc t ion 
strategy and, thus, delayed the comp le t ion po in t . I t i s cu r ren t ly expected that STP c o u l d 
reach the comp le t ion p o i n t in September 2006.29

Impact o f IDA Lending on Debt Sustainability 

9 . 
As presented in f igu re 1, STP’s debt ra t ios are expected t o f a l l t o leve ls b e l ow the 
H I P C threshold once STP bene f i ts f r o m the large o i l revenues expected in 2012. IDA 
lending, w h i c h i s p r o v i d e d in highly concessional terms, w o u l d have a greater impac t o n 
STP’s debt sus ta inab i l i ty during the p e r i o d o f 2005 -1 1, be fo re the a r r i v a l o f o i l revenues. 

10. Under the base case scenario, the I D A - 1 4 envelope f o r F Y 0 6 - 0 8 p rov ides f o r an 
a l loca t ion o f US$5 .5 m i l l i o n f o r STP. P r o v i d e d that STP observes p o s i t i v e pe r fo rmance 

- 6 4 - 

th roughou t t h i s period, IDA a l loca t ion c o u l d b e increased up t o US$7.5 m i l l i o n under the 
high case scenario. 

1 1. 
A c c o r d i n g t o the current I D A - 1 4 guidelines, STP i s e l ig ib le t o receive 100 
percent o f i t s F Y 0 6 IDA a l loca t ion in the f o r m o f grants ( i t s e l i g i b i l i t y f o r g r a n t s in F Y 0 7 
and F Y 0 8 w i l l b e determined at a later point). E v e n unde r such scenario, and assuming 
that the IDA a l loca t ion f o r the f o l l ow i n g C A S p e r i o d i s p r o v i d e d at least as 50 percent 
grants, the ex te rna l debt burden i s p ro jec ted t o r em a i n high. (F igu re 2) 

12. 
G i v e n the sma l l f inanc ia l envelope available f o r STP, the impac t o n the debt 
burden o f p r o v i d i n g the full IDA a l loca t ion as loans w o u l d b e small, but n o t ins ign i f ican t . 
As presented in Figure 2 be low , under the base case scenario f o r the CAS , the NPV t o 
exports ra t io i s estimated at 269 percent at end-2005, and i s p ro jec ted t o rema in above 
200 percent until 2012 w h e n i t i s expected t o reduce s ign i f ican t ly t o 45 percent. M o v i n g 
t o the high case scenario, w o u l d result in a s l igh t increase in the NPV ra t io f r o m 273 
percent in 2007 t o 274 percent. 

13. 
Desp i te the prospect o f large o i l revenues in the future, debt sus ta inab i l i ty remains 
a concern in the near term. Furthermore, in the event that o i l comme rc ia l iza t ion i s 
delayed, IDA f inanc ing in concessional t e rm s , w o u l d b e essential t o reduce STP’s high 
debt burden. Nevertheless, the a r r iva l o f o i l revenues in 2012 w i l l represent an impo r tan t 
structural change in STP’s economy, thus i t s f inanc ia l needs w i l l need t o be reassessed t o 
better re f lec t STP’s p o s i t i o n as an o i l p roduc ing coun t ry .

Debt Sustainability Analysis fo r Low-Income Countries Framework 

14. 
T h i s section presents an analysis o f the p ro jec ted debt p r o f i l e o f STP using the 
L I C f ramewo rk methodology, w h i c h p rov ides f o r a fo rwa rd - look ing analysis o f the 
country’s ex tema l debt sustainability. 

15. 
As p rev ious ly mentioned, one o f the differences with the H I P C me thodo logy i s 
that the debt bu rden ind ica to rs in the L I C f ramewo rk are based o n the q u a l i t y o f each 
countries’ po l ic ies and institutions, as measured by their C P I A rating. In th is context, STP 
i s c lass i f ied as a weak p o l i c y country, o n the base o f i t s 2003 C P I A rate (2.7). Tab le 1 
b e l ow shows the applicable ind ica t ive debt-burden thresholds and compares them with 
the STP’s p ro jec ted average ra t ios f o r the pe r iods 2004 -1 1 and 2012-24:

16. 
As p rev ious ly suggested by the results observed u s i n g the H I P C me thodo logy , the 
L I C f ramewo rk indicates that STP faces a high risk o f distress, even after the full d e l i v e r y 
o f H I P C assistance. Even though debt service ra t ios do n o t signal that a d is t ress s i tua t ion 
i s an immed ia te concem (debt service t o exports r a t i o i s estimated at 1 4 percent as o f 
end-2005 and i s p ro jec ted t o r em a i n b e l ow the debt-burden th resho ld th roughou t the 
p e r i o d o f analysis), the high debt ra t ios s igna l an impo r tan t risk o f debt distress (Table 
2.a). U n d e r the baseline scenario, the NPV o f debt t o exports as o f end-2005 i s estimated 
at 2 4 1 percent, inc reas ing t o 274 percent in 2008 and sharply decreasing t o 19 percent by 
2012. S im i la r ly , the GDP t o exports ratio, estimated at 107 percent as o f end-2005, i s 
p ro jec ted sha rp ly decrease t o 16 percent by 2012. 

17. 
T h e dramatic reduc t ion in the debt and debt service ra t io in 2012 i s an ind ica t ive 
resu l t that STP’s debt sus ta inab i l i ty i s highly dependent o n the success o f the p r o d u c t i o n 
and comme rc ia l iza t ion o f o i l . Any delays in the schedule foreseen w i l l have a s ign i f ican t 
impac t o n the debt burden and w o u l d requ i re STP t o r e l y h e a v i l y o n ex tema l f inanc ing in 
highly concessional terms. 

- 6 6 - 

18. 
Compa r ing the baseline assumptions w i th STP’s h is to r ica l pe r fo rmance reinforces 
these results. Assuming that the k e y macroeconomic variables tha t determine the debt 
dynamics g r ow at the i r h is to r ica l levels resulted in a s ign i f ican t de te r io ra t ion o f the debt 
and debt service ra t ios compared t o the baseline a ~ s u m p t i o n s . ~ ~ As presented in Tab le 2.b 
and Figure 3, the NPV o f debt t o exports i s p ro jec ted t o b e m o r e than 100 percentage 
po in ts higher than the baseline by 2010, rema in ing w e l l above the ind ica t ive thresholds 
throughout the pe r iod o f analysis. S im i la r ly , the NPV o f debt t o GDP ra t io i s p ro jec ted t o 
reach 11 8 by 201 1 and i s expected t o r em a i n at levels above the debt-burden thresholds 
throughout the p e r i o d o f analysis. Such scenario underscores the impo r tance o f rea l iz ing 
the targets set ou t in the baseline, in pa r t icu la r in terms o f o i l - re la ted exports. 

19. 
Furthermore, stress tests pe r fo rmed under the L I C f ramewo rk ind ica te the 
vu lne rab i l i ty o f debt distress t o shocks in exports.36 U n d e r such scenario, STP’s NPV o f 
debt t o exports ra t io i s s ign i f ican t ly affected, reach ing a peak o f 404 percent by 2008, 
m o r e than 100 percent h ighe r than the baseline p ro jec t ion . (Table 2.b and F igu re 3) 

Conclusion 

20. 
STP’s NPV o f debt-to-exports i s estimated t o have increased s ign i f ican t ly since 
the dec is ion po in t . The increase was mainly due t o changes in exchange and discount 
rates, new b o r r ow i n g and l ow e r than anticipated exports. The upda ted D S A underscores 
the importance o f reach ing the H P C comp le t ion p o i n t in order t o reduce STP’s high debt 
indicators, in pa r t icu la r p r i o r t o the “ o i l era”. I t also h igh l igh ts the needs t o consider the 
structural change that the economy w i l l face at the beg inn ing o f the o i l comme rc ia l iza t ion 
phase t o better assess STP’s future f inanc ing needs. 

2 1. 
In addition, the p reced ing scenarios suggest a high risk o f debt distress and a high 
sens i t iv i ty t o the a r r i v a l o f o i l revenues. Even unde r the baseline assumptions, debt ra t ios 
w i l l n o t reach a sustainable l e v e l until the beg inn ing o f the o i l comme rc ia l iza t ion phase; 
any delays in the schedule w o u l d se r ious ly comp rom ise STP’s ex tema l long - te rm debt 
sustainability. In this context, the government faces the challenge o f m a i n t a i n i n g 
responsible f isca l po l ic ies and a c red ib le strategy t o sustain g r ow t h with a v i e w t o 
strengthen STP’s repaymen t capac i ty and reduce v u l n e r a b i l i t y t o shocks, in pa r t icu la r 
exports shocks. E q u a l l y impo r tan t w i l l be the authorities’ e f fo r ts in d i v e r s i f y i n g i t s 
exports base (highly concentrated in services and cocoa exports) t o fu r the r reduce i t s 
exposure t o expo r t shocks and m i n im i z e i t s impac t in the future. 

35 The standard assumptions under this scenario are that rea l GDP grow th , in f la t ion , non-interest current 
account (in percent o f GDP), and non-debt-creating i n f l ow s (in percent o f GDP ) rema in at t h e i r 10- 
year h is to r ica l average. Given STP’s h i g h dependence o n t h e exports g r ow t h in 2012, i t i s further 
assumed that the trade balance as percent o f GD P w i l l also remain at i t s h is to r ica l average. 
36 The s t ress t e s t assumes tha t exports g r ow t h i s one standard dev ia t ion b e l ow i t s h is to r ica l l e v e l du r ing 
the pe r iod 2006-07. This scenario represents a 25 percent p robab i l i ty o f occurrence.
