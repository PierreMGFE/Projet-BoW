EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Achievements, Challenges and Wo r ld Bank Group Role 

i. 

Cambodia has made some significant achievements since the United Nations (UN)-supervised 
peace process of 1991-93. However, after decades of wa r and au tho r i ta r ian government, Cambodia is 
i n many ways s t i l l a post-conflict society and po l i t ica l system. The coun try i s at peace, increasingly 
integrated w i t h the reg ion and the wor ld , and has enjoyed a decade o f large ly unbroken macroeconomic 
s tab i l i ty and grow th . However, the three- fo ld trans i t ion that began in the la te 1980s-from c i v i l war to 
peace, f r om one-party ru le to mu l t i -pa r ty democracy, and f r o m economic iso la t ion t o integration-has 
g iven r i s e to comp lex and o f ten negative forms o f state-society re la t ionsh ip and weak accountability fo r 
the management of pub l ic resources. This Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS), wh ich covers F Y 0 5 to 
FY08, accord ing ly iden t i f ies governance issues as the p r ima ry obstacle to sustainable pover ty reduc t ion 
in Cambodia. 

ii. Strong economic grow th between 1994 and 2003 has been narrow ly based i n a few sectors and 
to date appears to have had l i t t le impact on poverty. The benefits o f g row th have been very unequally 
distributed, w i t h selected geographical areas and a sma l l p ropo r t ion o f the popu la t ion ga in ing far more 
than others. G r ow t h in agr icu l ture (on wh ich the ma jo r i ty o f the population, especially the poor, 
depends) varies grea t ly f r om one year to the nex t but has averaged far be low the g row th rate o f the 
economy as a whole. Ove ra l l g row th i s now l i k e l y to slow as the rap id quota-based expansion o f the 
garment sector in recent years may w e l l reverse in the face o f increased compe t i t ion f r om lower-cos t 
producers f o l l ow i n g the exp i ry o f the M u l t i f i b r e Arrangement (MFA). Fur ther g row th and stronger 
linkages to pove r ty reduc t ion w i l l require urgent ac t ion to imp rove competitiveness and d ive rs i fy the 
sources o f growth, par t icu lar ly in regard to smallholder agr icu l ture and other ru ra l economic activities. 

iii. The Government's development strategy has evolved through a number of documents. The most 
recent-the Rectangular Strategy (RS)-was 
announced b y the new Government that formed in Ju ly 
2004 after a year-long pos t-e lec t ion impasse. This C A S i s in tended to he lp imp lemen t the RS, wh ich 
prov ides a sound diagnosis o f Cambodia's development challenges-particularly 
the central importance 
o f good governance-and a comprehensive l i s t o f actions to tackle these problems, but which, l i k e other 
government strategies before it, s t i l l needs to be translated i n t o p r io r i t ies and implementation. The 
W o r l d Bank, in partnership w i t h other donors, w i l l support the fo rmu la t ion o f the Government's new 
f ive-year p lan fo r the pe r iod 2006-2010. 

i v . 
Over the last decade, uncoordinated and donor- led a id has often slowed o r even undermined 
the evolution of good governance. Increasing recogn i t ion o f this p rob lem l e d in 2004 to a Govemmen t- 
donor consensus o n an agenda f o r harmon iza t ion and alignment, t o wh ich the W o r l d Bank Group has 
con tr ibu ted actively. 
I t i s a cen tra l p r inc ip le o f t h i s CAS to w o r k through strategic partnerships to 
reduce transaction costs, imp rove accountability, and support the development o f core state capacities. 
The f i r s t two sections o f this C A S document are shared w i t h the new coun try strategies o f the As ian 
Development Bank (ADB), UK Department f o r In terna t iona l Deve lopmen t (DFID), and the UN 
Development System (UNDS ) , w i t h whom the W o r l d Bank has collaborated closely. The ADB, Japan 
and the W o r l d B a n k have also wo rked over the last year to imp rove synergies among their programs. 

Lessons Learned 

v . 

D raw ing on reviews and extensive consultations, the CAS reflects three ma in lessons learned: 

- 11 - 

0 The need to focus on governance throughout the country program. Poor governance has been the 
p r ima ry constraint on the impac t o f the W o r l d Bank Group and o f development po l ic ies generally. 

The need to improve donor coordination and partnerships. Poor governance and poor donor 

behav ior have been closely related. Poor governance has encouraged donors to adopt short-term 
approaches to development effectiveness and helped ra t iona l ize uncoordinated aid; insu f f ic ien t 
donor coord ina t ion or outreach to c i v i l society has accentuated the problems o f weak governance. 

0 The need for a clear focus on results. This requires greater criteria-based se lec t iv i ty and a clear 
de f in i t ion o f the expected re la t ionsh ip between inputs, activities, progress indicators and outcomes. 

CAS Ob j e c t i v e s and Resu lts 

v i . ' 
The ac t iv i t ies described in the CAS are intended to contribute t o s ix objectives, wh ich are 
clustered under t w o over-arching pillars. 

v i i . 

Activities under P i l la r I are intended to help implement improvements in govemance that are 
needed if Cambodia is to meet the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs). T o t h i s end, 

the C A S establishes fou r objectives. First, i t w i l l tackle aspects o f economic governance that raise the 
cost o f do ing business, deter investment and trade, and h o l d back strong, broad-based p r iva te sector 
development (PSD). Second, i t w i l l seek to support po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l re forms that he lp the ru ra l 
poo r achieve mo re say in and receive more benefits f r om sustainable natural resources management, b y 
imp rov ing transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the governance o f na tura l resources and land in par t icu lar . 
Third, i t w i l l address core issues o f pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) as a fundamental backbone fo r 
imp roved service de l ivery . I t w i l l do so b y supporting the Government's comprehensive timetable fo r 
P F M r e f o rm and the fo rmu la t ion o f strategies f o r re fo rm o f pay and human resource management. 
Four th , i t w i l l promo te accountability-between 
elected o f f ic ia ls and those responsible f o r de l ive r ing 
services; between citizens and the state; and between those who deliver services and the citizens who 
rece ive them-by 
supporting decentralization and p romo t ing citizens' partnerships 
f o r better 
governance. 

v i i i . 

P i l la r 2 of 
the CAS allocates World Bank activities and resources to supporting the strategy 
development and investments needed to attain the CMDGs. T o these ends, the W o r l d Bank G roup f i r s t 

w i l l encourage the emergence o f ho l is t ic , pover ty- focused approaches to the fo rmu la t ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f pub l ic p o l i c y by suppor t ing the preparation o f the new Na t iona l Strategic 
Deve lopmen t P lan (NSDP 2006-2010). Second, where there are clear gaps in c r i t ica l in fras truc ture and 
human development sub-sectors, the W o r l d B a n k G roup w i l l support the emergence o f a na t iona l ly - 
owned v is ion and strategy through the p rov is ion o f ana ly t ica l and investment services. 

i x . 
I f focus ing o n key governance i s s u e s and supporting e f for ts to attain the CMDG s defines what 
the W o r l d Bank Group w i l l do in the nex t CAS period, wo rk ing through strategic partnerships and 
p romo t ing the development o f na t iona l ownersh ip defines how r e s u l t s w i l l be achieved. The W o r l d 
Bank Group w i l l undertake more active commun ica t ion o f goals and ac t iv i t ies and more systematic 
engagement w i t h c i v i l society and the pr iva te sector stakeholders w i t h i n Cambodia; and w i l l con tr ibu te 
to imp rov ing Government-led coord ina t ion o f ex terna l assistance, either wo rk ing through o r he lp ing t o 
promo te the evo lu t ion o f coord ina t ion structures such as sector-wide approaches (SWAPS) . 

World Bank G r o u p Assistance 

x . 
A m i x o f loans, grants and ana ly t ica l services w i l l be used in pursuit o f these goals. Annual, 
single-tranche Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Cred i ts (PRSCs) w i l l be in troduced to support p r io r i ty 

- 111 - 

re forms in PFM, PSD and land management. Increasing attention w i l l be g iven to po r t fo l io quality, 
w i t h annual rev iews o f performance con tr ibu t ing to improved f iduc ia ry controls. Ana ly t ica l and 
adv isory ac t iv i t ies (AAA) w i l l support the focus on addressing governance impediments to pover ty 
reduc t ion and o n meeting strategy and investment needs in sectors c r i t ica l t o attaining the CMDGs . 
Wherever possible, analytical w o r k w i l l be approached in partnership w i t h the Government, other 
donors and/or c i v i l society stakeholders in order to facilitate consensus-building, donor coordination, 
and government ownership o f po l icy recommendations. The W o r l d Bank w i l l seek to ensure that 
analysis i s commissioned and managed in such a way that i t contributes to the long- term accumulation 
o f na t iona l capacity fo r po l icy-or ien ted economic and social analysis. 

x i . 
Poor governance ind ica tor scores in the Coun try Po l icy and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessment (CP IA) 
has reduced the W o r l d Bank base case lend ing envelope f r om US$70 m i l l i o n per annum in 2002 to 
US$45 m i l l i o n per annum in 2004. A l loca t ion o f Bank resources fo r Cambodia cou ld increase 
s ign i f ican t ly over this CAS period, i f key governance indicators are improved . I t cou ld also decrease i f 
progress i s no t made and there i s a worsening o f governance indicators. The C A S i s intended to support 
government .e f for ts to improve i t s C P I A ratings and thus ga in access to a s ign i f ican t ly h igher volume o f 
IDA resources. 

Agenda fo r Board Consideration 

x i i . 
G iven this assessment and proposal, Boa rd members may w ish to discuss, among others, the 
f o l l ow i n g aspects o f t h i s CAS : 
I s the focus on governance i s s u e s appropriate and adequately fo l lowed through? 
. I s the m i x o f instruments and ac t iv i t ies consistent w i t h this governance focus? 
= H o w does the Bank ac t ive ly manage po ten t ia l risks to the'effectiveness o f i t s investments and to i t s 
reputation? 

CAMBODIA - - COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 

Cambodia's last Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No . 2077-KH), presented to 
the Bank's Boa rd o f D irec tors in February 2000, covered FYOO-03. D u r i n g this C A S pe r iod the 
Government o f Cambodia completed the Na t iona l Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), wh ich 
serves f o r the W o r l d Bank and the IMF as the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 
That document was presented to the Boa rd o f Directors in January 2003. This current CAS w i l l 
cover the per iod f r om FYO5-08. 

2. 

I n the early stages of prepara t ion fo r this CAS, i t was noted that the Asian Development 
Bank ( AD B ) and the UK Department fo r In terna t iona l Development ( D F I D ) were also prepar ing 
their next medium-term country strategies along timeframes that were s im i lar to that of the Bank 
Group . As a concrete step towards donor harmonization, these three donors agreed to fo l low a 
j o i n t country strategy formu la t ion process. As a result, Sections I1 and I11 o f this document are 
also t o b e found in the ADB Coun try Strategy and Program (CSP) and the DFID Coun try 
Assistance P lan (CAP), as i s the first part o f Section VI'. The CAS i s also substantially aligned 
w i t h the Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) o f the UN, wh ich j o i n e d the ADB-DFID- 
W o r l d B a n k partnership i n mid-2004. 

3. 

As pa r t of this strategy prepara t ion process, ADB , D F I D and the Wo r ld Bank organized 
j o i n t consultation workshops w i t h partners and stakeholders-the Govemment, other donors, 
NGOs and c iv i l society, and the pr iva te sector-in October 2003. These were used to i n f o rm those 
present o f the process, and to seek their thoughts o n what lessons the partners shou ld have learned, 
what they should rea l is t ica l ly a im f o r over f i v e years, and h ow they might go about ach iev ing this. 
The three-and 
later four- partners met regu lar ly throughout 2004 to agree upon the common text 
in sections I and 11; to update each other o n developments in their plans f o r lend ing and analytical 
work; and to agree upon an evo lv ing d iv is ion o f labor and a l loca t ion o f " lead donor" 
responsibilities w i t h i n the group, whereby i f one o f the partners took the lead on p o l i c y dialogue 
f o r a g iven sector or sub-sector, the other partners agreed to a l ign their assistance beh ind this lead. 
W i t h the ir strategies large ly in place and aligned, the fou r donors he ld another round o f workshops 
in October 2004, feeding back to the Government, donors, N G O and pr iva te sector actors h ow they 
had attempted to act on the discussions o f the previous year.

There have been a number of benefits of this process. There i s less dup l ica t ion and fewer 
gaps in terms o f the sectoral coverage o f the four partners' programs vis-&vis Cambodia's needs 
and pr ior i t ies . The partnership process has reduced the transaction costs f o r government partners, 
who have been able to engage in a more rounded debate in mu l t i la tera l discussion w i t h the fou r 
donors than wou ld have been possible in fou r separate sets o f b i la tera l discussions: i t has also 
helped t o ensure greater coherence and consistency in the messages that the fou r donors (and by 
extension, the donor commun i ty) send the Government - and other Cambodian stakeholders - 
about the ir objectives and requirements. With other partners in the pr iva te sector, c i v i l society and 
the donor community, t h i s approach has either s im i la r ly helped to reduce the t ime and e f fo r t 
requ ired to achieve input t o the coun try strategy (CS) preparation process, and/or created 
opportunities fo r consultation where they s imp ly might no t otherwise have been present 
previously. I t can also reasonably be argued to have had an impor tan t demonstration effect, as an 
early manifestation o f donors' professed in ten t ion to a l ign and harmonize the ir assistance. 

' T h e only difference i s that sections J (Medium-Term Economic Outlook) and K (Debt and Creditworthiness) have 
been added to Chapter I, and section B to the discussion o f risks in Chapter VI, as these sections are required in a 
Bank Group CAS.

Against this i t must be acknowledged that the transaction costs fo r the four partners 
themselves have in a l l l ike l ihood been the same o r greater than w o u l d have been the case i f they 

had prepared their ow n stand-alone country strategies. The process has probab ly added to the staff 
time costs and overa l l leng th o f the process. However, a l l fou r partners consider this an acceptable 
pr ice to pay f o r the gains made.

A. 

DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT 

6. 

Cambodia i s at a crossroads in i t s development as i t moves away f r o m a pos t-con f l ic t 
situation and towards a more norma l development paradigm. Over tw o decades o f iso la t ion and 
con f l ic t , wh ich ended o n l y in 1991 w i t h the signing o f the Paris Peace Agreements, devastated 
much o f the country's physical, social and human capital, fo rc ing the na t ion t o s ta r t f r om scratch in 
rebu i ld ing i t s infrastructure and ins t i tu t ions . 

7. 

M u c h has been achieved in recent years. Cambodia has made impor tan t progress in 
ensuring peace and security, rebu i ld ing institutions, establishing a stable macroeconomic 
environment, and a l ibe ra l investment regime. No tw i ths tand ing these achievements, the 
development agenda remains daunting. Poverty rates rema in very h igh-w i th 
around 3 5 4 0 
percent o f the popu la t ion rema in ing be low the poverty l ine , and 15-20 percent in extreme 
poverty-and 
inequa l i ty appears to be increasing. Recent economic g row th has been na r row ly 
based, and has no t l e d t o a significant reduc t ion in poverty. Ach iev ing many o f the Cambodia 
M i l l e n n i um Development Goals (CMDGs) w i l l be d i f f icu l t . 

8. 

With peace and macroeconomic s tab i l i ty n ow more f i rm l y entrenched, the country has the 
oppor tun i ty to make far reach ing economic reforms to achieve sustained socio-economic 
development. Within this context, i t augurs w e l l that the Government has developed a 
comprehensive r e f o rm agenda as set out in the Second Socio-Economic Deve lopmen t Plan, (SEDP 
11) 2001-2005, NPRS 2003-2005, and the Rectangular Strategy f o r Grow th , Emp loymen t E q u i t y 
and E f f ic iency (RS) to meet the CMDGs . 

B. 

ECONOMIC GROWTH 

9 . 

Re f lec t ing prudent macroeconomic policies and favorable external developments as 
indicated b y significant a i d i n f l ow s and the signing in 1996 o f a b i la tera l trade agreement w i t h the 
US , Cambodia's gross domestic product (GDP) grew b y an average 6.8 percent f r om 1999 to 
2002, compared to 5.6 percent f r om 1995 to 1998. H a v i n g peaked at 10.8 percent in 1999, GDP 
grow th declined consistently, f a l l i n g t o 5.3 percent in 2003. G r ow t h in 2003 was h e l d back by the 
SARS outbreak and an t i-Tha i riots, w h i c h adversely affected tourism. The fac t that i t took one 
year to f o rm a new government after elections in Ju ly 2003 also dampened the business 
environment. O n the pos i t ive side, agr icu l tura l produc t ion staged a strong recovery f r om a 
drought-induced decline in 2002, and the export-oriented garment indus try expanded strongly. 
Over the past decade, the indus tr ia l sector was the ma in engine o f growth, w i t h industry's share o f 
GDP increasing f r om 13 percent in 1992 to 26 percent in 2002, and that o f agr icu l ture f a l l i n g f r om 
48 percent to 33 percent during this per iod . The manufacturing subsector was the largest 
contributor to incremental GDP, w i t h garments being the key d r ive r o f such grow th . T o u r i sm also 
contributed s ign i f ican t ly t o growth, w h i l e agriculture has g rown modestly, lagg ing beh ind 
popu la t ion growth. G r ow t h recovered to an estimated 6 percent in 2004, ow i n g t o a strong 
performance by the tou r ism and cons truc t ion sectors, and despite the s lowdown in agriculture. 
There are fears o f a sharp s lowdown in 2005 w i t h the phasing out o f the M u l t i f i b r e Arrangement 
(MFA) at the end o f 2004. The 2005 g row th rate i s expected to drop t o about 2.7 percent w i t h a 

reduc t ion in exports. G row th in services and construction are also expected to slow, but the impac t 
w i l l be somewhat offset b y strong grow th in tourism. 

10. With Cambodia’s economy rema in ing h igh ly dollarized, the authorities have had limited 
scope to emp loy trad i t iona l tools f o r monetary management. As a result, prudent f isca l po l icy has 
been the k e y to ensuring p r ice stability, and Cambodia has achieved rates o f i n f l a t i o n w e l l be low 4 
percent since 1999, aside f r om an exogenously induced increase in 2004. However, w i t h demand 
for r i e l con t inu ing to increase w i t h economic growth, the authorities have o f late also been 
in terven ing in fore ign exchange markets to stabilize the exchange rate. As a result, the exchange 
rate rema ined broad ly stable at around 4,000 r i e l s per U S do l lar i n 2003, w i t h in f la t ion averaging 
o n l y 0.5 percent. However, the Government’s revenue performance in 2003 deteriorated due t o a 
drop in trade and excise taxes despite recent efforts at im p r o v i n g tax administration and collection. 
The fa l l i n revenues widened the overall f isca l de f ic i t to 7 percent o f GDP in 2003 f r om 6.7 
percent i n 2002, and reduced spending in the p r i o r i t y sectors o f health, education, rural 
development and agriculture. The f isca l de f ic i t declined, however, in 2004 t o 6.9 percent o f GDP, 
re f lec t ing a projected improvement in the revenue-to-GDP r a t i o f r om 10.4 percent in 2003 to 10.9 
percent i n 2004. As i n recent years, large a id i n f l ow s he lped finance the de f ic i t . Despite a modest 
decrease in the trade de f ic i t , the current account de f ic i t (exc lud ing o f f i c i a l transfers) widened to 
10.2 percent o f GDP in 2003 f r om 9 percent i n 2002, ow i n g to a narrower services surplus as 
receipts f r o m tour ism moderated, before dec l in ing s l igh t ly t o 10 percent in 2004. The de f ic i t was 
financed through pr iva te and o f f ic ia l transfers and cap i ta l in f lows . Gross fore ign exchange 
reserves at US$737 m i l l i o n at the end o f 2003 were su f f ic ien t to cover almost three months o f 
impor ts . 

11. 

Cambodia must resolve several structural constraints to economic growth. The ex is t ing 
sources o f g row th are na r row ly based o n garments and tourism. Prospects fo r garments are, 
however, uncertain w i t h the phasing out o f the MFA. N e w sources o f g row th must be tapped to 
achieve the 6-7 percent g row th target in the RS and find employment f o r the estimated 250,000 
persons entering the labor market each year. With 90 percent o f the poor l i v i n g in ru ra l areas, 
p romo t ing agriculture i s considered to be the best strategy t o accelerate growth, absorb a large part 
o f the g r ow i n g labor force, and address pover ty more d irec t ly . Ag r icu l tu ra l production, however, 
remains fa r be low po ten t ia l due to l o w p roduc t iv i ty and constrained access to arable land and 
markets. Ach iev ing new, o r diversified, sources o f g r ow t h w o u l d require s ign i f ican t ly h igher rates 
o f p roduc t iv i ty and investment. However, prospects f o r a s ign i f ican t increase in pub l ic investment 
are l im i t e d ow i n g to a very l o w govemment revenue base. On the other hand, pr iva te investment i s 
hampered b y infrastructure bottlenecks (par t icu lar ly in powe r and transportation), a weak and 
sha l low f inanc ia l system, a l a c k o f sk i l led labor, and weaknesses in governance rang ing f r om an 
ine f fec tua l p o l i c y and regulatory environment and poo r service delivery, 
t o bureaucratic 
ine f f ic iency and endemic corruption. A l l o f these serve to s ign i f ican t ly increase transaction costs, 
weaken business confidence, produc t iv i ty , and competitiveness o f the economy. W h i l e gains have 
been made i n structural re forms over the last decade - par t icu lar ly those re la t ing t o trade, pr ice 
and exchange rate l ibera l iza t ion , tax and f inanc ia l sector reforms, and pr iva t iza t ion and leasing o f 
state enterprises - the p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l setting in almost a l l sectors o f the economy merits 
substantial re form . Progress has been par t icu lar ly s low in lega l and j u d i c i a l reforms, fo rc ing the 
pr iva te sector to operate under uncertain market rules. A strengthened revenue mob i l iza t ion e f fo r t 
w i l l also be cruc ia l f o r the Government to increase social spending and imp rove the qua l i ty o f 
pub l ic services. The new Government has moved q u i c k l y to address some o f these issues, 
par t icu lar ly reduc ing the cost and time associated w i t h im p o r t and export procedures and company 
registration, and in r a t i f y i n g Cambodia’s accession to the W o r l d Trade Organization (WTO). 
W h i l e benefits f r om the la t ter are expected t o be w ide rang ing - w i t h more than 40 pieces o f 
leg is la t ion re la t ing to commerc ia l transactions to be adopted over the com ing years - strong e f fo r t 
needs to be placed o n proper imp lemen ta t ion o f the leg is la t ion i f the benefits are to materialize.

POVERTY' 

- 4 - 

12. 

Despite data l im i ta t ions , there i s consensus on the pr inc ipa l characteristics o f pover ty in 
Cambodia. Around 35-40 percent o f the popu la t ion has expenditure levels be low the national 
expenditure poverty l ine , w i t h 15-20 percent in extreme (or food) poverty. Poverty in Cambodia i s 
overwhe lm ing ly rural, w i t h poverty headcounts ranging f r om a l o w o f 10-15 percent in Phnom 
Penh to 40-45 percent i n the rura l areas, reaching 70-80 percent in some areas around the Ton le 
Sap Basin. Despite re la t ive ly robust g row th over the past decade, o f f i c i a l figures suggest that the 
incidence o f poverty declined on ly modestly f r om 39 percent in 1994 to 36 percent in 1999. This 
i s due t o a range o f factors inc lud ing the narrowness o f the existing sources o f growth, w i t h few i f 
any backward linkages to the domestic economy; a l a c k o f in tegra t ion o f the poor to the 
mainstream economy; poor qua l i ty o f and lack o f access to social services; l a c k o f access to credit; 
a lack o f equitable access to land, forestry and fisheries resources; and a lack o f e f fec t ive vo ice f o r 
the poor (par t icu lar ly m i n o r i t y groups and women) in the decisions that shape their l ives . 

13. 

Progress in reduc ing human or non-monetary dimensions to pover ty has been m ixed . 
There has been considerable movement toward attainment o f universal p r ima ry enrolment, w i t h 
the net p r ima ry school enrolment rate increasing to 89 percent ( f r om 76 percent in 1997); but, due 
to a comb ina t ion o f ch i ldren who en ro l l but drop ou t and those who never enro l l , Cambodia 
remains o f f- track regarding the C M D G f o r universal pr imary completion. The qua l i ty and 
a f fo rdab i l i ty o f education have improved, but further progress i s needed. There remains 
s ign i f ican t gender inequa l i ty in education, w i t h girls curren t ly accounting f o r o n l y 39 percent o f 
lowe r secondary school enrolment and su f fer ing h igher drop-out rates. The population's health 
status i s l ow , w i t h child mo r ta l i ty estimated to be 118 per 1,000 l i v e births. Da ta as o f the mid- 
1990s show a high maternal mo r ta l i ty rate o f 437 per 100,000 l i v e births. A round 85 percent o f 
deliveries take place at home and sk i l led personnel attend t o less than h a l f o f a l l deliveries. There 
i s also an unmet demand f o r f am i l y p lann ing services that has led to a popu la t ion g row th rate o f 
about 2.4 percent per year, aggravating pover ty and increasing the pressure o n na tura l resources. 
A l though Cambodia has the highest H I V / A I D S in fec t ion rate in Asia, i t has made substantial 
progress, w i t h the adult prevalence rate dec l in ing f r om 3.3 percent in 1997 to 2.6 percent in 2002. 

14. 

Poverty pro f i les suggest that income inequa l i ty has increased, especially in ru ra l areas. 
S low agricultural g row th has exacerbated income inequa l i ty . Despite government commitments, 
inequalities are also pervasive in the status o f m i n o r i t y groups, hill communities, those displaced 
b y con f l ic t , and women. Various pover ty assessments indicate that pover ty increases w i t h 
household size and number o f children; b y occupation, the pover ty headcount i s highest where the 
household head i s engaged in agriculture. W h i l e households headed by a single woman are no t 
s ign i f ican t ly poorer than others (at least in terms o f income or consumption recorded in the sample 
surveys), they are often more vulnerable, hav ing less l a n d and labor resources and thus more need 
to r e l y more on cop ing strategies that are risky o r that reduce their odds o f escaping pover ty over 
the l o n g term (such as se l l ing assets, o r pulling ch i ldren out o f school and sending them to work) . 
Educa t ion plays an impor tan t ro le in pover ty . Poverty rates are s im i lar when the household head 
has n o schooling o r p r ima ry schooling on ly , and are s ign i f ican t ly lowe r when the household head 
has secondary, technical, o r h igher education. 

15 . 

A significant number o f peop le are also chron ica l ly vulnerable, m o v i n g i n t o and 
ma rg ina l ly out o f pover ty over the course o f the ir l ives . The poor also experience a high degree o f 
f o o d insecurity, even in provinces w h i c h en joy a r ice surplus. The ADB-sponsored par t ic ipa tory 

T h e most current multi-partner poverty assessment i s summarized in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 
(NPRS), wh ich i s the Government's poverty reduction strategy. M u c h o f t h i s analysis i s in turn based on the W o r l d 
Bank Poverty Assessment o f 1999. As an inpu t to the preparation o f their CSP, ADB prepared a review o f the state o f 
knowledge o f poverty in Cambodia to summarize the findings in NPRS and f rom other sources. T h i s review w i l l be 
an inpu t in the next j o i n t poverty assessment, expected in 2005, wh ich w i l l update poverty l ine estimates (and pu t 
them on a much more robust footing) f r om mid-2005, based on analysis o f Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey 
(CSES) 2004 data. 

- 5 - 

pover ty assessment o f 2001 indicated that the poor feel disempowered and l a c k confidence in loca l 
and p rov inc ia l administration. Limited access to land and natural resources, phys ica l infrastructure, 
and basic social services were highlighted.3 M a n y also iden t i f ied the erpsion o f f am i l y and 
commun i ty relationships as a ma jor concern. Health shocks due to accidents and illness are 
repeatedly mentioned as a leading cause o f vu lnerab i l i ty and poverty. Households spend a large 
propor t ion o f their income o n health care and a single health shock can be f inanc ia l ly d e v a ~ t a t i n g . ~

Progress in Ach iev ing the Cambodia M i l lenn ium Development Goals. W h i l e Cambodia 
has made some progress towards achieving some o f the CMDGs , a t ta in ing many o f the targets w i l l 
be d i f f i c u l t . Cambodia i s l i k e l y to meet the C M D G target f o r universal p r ima ry enrolment, but not 
o f completion. However, meeting the targets fo r secondary education ( inc lud ing female secondary 
school enrolment) seems un l ike ly . There has also been some progress towards achieving health- 
related goals, but at current rates, the increases are probably no t su f f ic ien t to meet the CMDGs . 
The coun try i s , however, l i k e l y to meet i t s C M D G target o f reduc ing HIV prevalence rates b y

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT 

17. 

The Paris Peace Agreement o f October 1991 in i t ia ted the process o f recovery and na t ion 
building in Cambodia. With UN involvement, the first multi-party elections were h e l d in Ju ly 
1993. In September 1993, a new Cons t i tu t ion was adopted, w h c h established the Government o f 
Cambodia as a mu l t ipa r ty l ibe ra l democracy under a constitutional monarchy. Cambodia i s a 
signatory to the M i l l e n n i um Dec lara t ion and i s a party to the six m a i n in terna t iona l human rights 
instruments. 

18. 

Three ma in po l i t ica l parties have dominated Cambodian po l i t ics over the last decade: the 
Cambodian People’s Party (CPP), the U n i t e d Fron t f o r an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia (FUNC INPEC) and, more recently, the Sam Ra insy Par ty (SRP). Since the 
first mandate o f the Government, three other nation-wide elections have been organized, inc lud ing 
the first commune elections in February 2002. 

19. 

A l though the CPP dominated the elections he ld o n Ju ly 27, 2003, i t did no t w i n the two - 
third ma jo r i ty requ ired under the cons t i tu t ion to f o rm a government on i t s own . A new 
government was fo rmed on Ju ly 15, 2004 after protracted negotiations between the CPP and 
FUNC INPEC (wh ich at one t ime also represented the interest o f the SRP) o n f o rm i n g a coa l i t ion 
government. During this period, the Na t iona l Assembly did no t meet, and n o leg is la t ive business 
was transacted. Apa r t f r om the general c l ima te o f uncertainty created by the pro longed hiatus, a 
number o f problems affected the ac t iv i t ies o f a l l development partners, inc lud ing : (i) the absence 
o f an authorized budget, wh ich l im i t e d the capacity to bo r row f r om donors, as w e l l as meet some 
p o l i c y measures; and (ii) the i n a b i l i t y to pass leg is la t ion required to meet tranche cond i t iona l i ty 
under program loans. 

20 . 

The forma t ion o f a new Government o n Ju ly 15, 2004 nevertheless represented a ma jor 
step fo rwa rd in the p o l i t i c a l development o f Cambodia. W h i l e government fo rma t ion has taken a

very l o n g time, i t has taken place through a process o f dialogue, where a l l outstanding differences 
between the po l i t ica l parties were apparently resolved, and w i thou t recourse to the violence that 
characterized the previous election outcomes. The new po l i t ica l environment has also been 
underpinned b y the recent abdication o f King Sihanouk and the peaceful coronation o f his son, 
Prince Sihamoni. Democratic developments are also ga in ing ground in other areas. The commune 
elections o f 2002 represent an important step in a comprehensive program o f po l i t ica l , 
administrative and f inanc ia l decentralization. There i s also increased par t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society 
and N G O groups in various areas o f pub l ic concern and a re la t ive ly underdeveloped media i s 
beg inn ing to exercise i t s new ly won freedom. However, c i v i l society organizations face 
s ign i f ican t challenges in accessing in forma t ion , dialogue and in participatory processes. The 
Government's capacity to engage in po l icy dialogue w i t h c i v i l society i s growing, but participatory 
mechanisms have yet to be mainstreamed i n t o pub l ic p lann ing or mon i to r ing processes.

GOVERNANCE AND INST ITUT IONAL CAPACITY' 

21. 

M o s t institutions in Cambodia were barely func t ion ing when the Government began i t s 
first mandate in 1993. A l though Cambodia has made impor tan t progress in rebu i ld ing institutions, 
the coun try continues to operate far be low i t s economic and social potential due to weak 
governance. K e y areas o f governance requ ir ing reforms include: addressing corruption, the lega l 
and j u d i c i a l system, pub l ic financial management, pub l ic administration, and loca l governance. 
The Government i s w e l l aware o f these challenges and has proposed reforms in k e y p o l i c y 
documents inc lud ing the Governance A c t i o n Plan (GAP), SEDP 11, NPRS and RS. Despite much 
e f fo r t be ing devoted to p o l i c y formulation, the imp lemen ta t ion o f reforms has been slow. There i s 
also need f o r enhanced participation o f ordinary citizens in public-decision mak ing so as t o

inconsistencies in legislation, limited transparency in leg is la t ive processes, weak capacity to dra f t

and corrup t ion in the jud ic iary , the need f o r r e f o rm o f the Supreme Counc i l o f Magistracy, the

Corruption. Weak ins t i tu t ions and l im i t e d mechanisms o f accountability, wh ich are 
legacies o f Cambodia's recent history, contribute to high levels o f corruption. A l though d i f f i c u l t 
t o quantify, the evidence suggests that corrup t ion seriously constrains economic growth, pr iva te 
sector development (PSD), and pover ty reduction. A recent study o f the country's competitiveness 
iden t i f ied the cost o f corrup t ion as the single most impor tan t constraint faced b y the pr iva te sector 
in do ing business in Cambodia! Other surveys also indicate corrup t ion to b e a key concern o f 
households, firms, pub l ic officials, NGOs and  academic^.^ 

27. 

Gaps in the lega l framework and weak implementation and enforcement o f ex is t ing 
regulations and laws have hampered an t i-corrup t ion efforts. A l though some progress has been 
made in establishing a Na t iona l Audit Au tho r i ty and in in troduc ing procurement procedures in 
most m i n i s t r i e s , the existing dra f t l a w o n a n t i - c om p t i o n needs to be brough t i n t o compliance w i t h 
in terna t iona l best practice (such as re f lec ted in the U n i t e d Nations Conven t ion Against Corruption) 
and enacted. 

28 . 

Decentralization.' The Government sees decentralization as cruc ia l t o the strengthening 
o f loca l voice in the Government and im p r o v i n g pub l ic service de l ivery . W h i l e the ho ld ing o f 
commune elections was an impor tan t f i rs t step, further e f fo r t i s needed to expand opportunities f o r 
citizens to influence and participate in governance. Curren t ly the commune councils con t ro l very 
l im i ted resources resu l t ing in l o w leve ls o f imp lemen ta t ion o f services and investment. They s t i l l 
l a c k the authority, administrative capacity, and f inanc ia l resources to accelerate development at 
the ir level, and have l im i t e d means f o r dispute resolution. Government p o l i c y o n deconcentration 
has no t yet been c lear ly articulated and there i s a need f o r stronger harmon iza t ion between 
decentralization and deconcentration policies. An e f fo r t i s currently be ing made t o arr ive at a 
comprehensive perspective f o r decentralization and deconcentration.

GENDER ASSESSMENT9 

29 . 

Cambodia has among the lowes t levels o f gender equity in As ia as measured by the 
gender-related development index (0.557) and the gender empowerment index (0.364)". Social 
attitudes and trad i t ion deem women t o be o f l ow e r status. The consequences o f these trad i t iona l 
attitudes are c lear ly manifest in the s ign i f ican t gender inequities in educational attainment and

In Cambodia, decentralization re fe rs to the transfer o f governmental powers, mandates and resources from central 
government to sub-national authorities; while deconcentration refers to assignment o f cen t ra l administration to a 
lower level of administration.

levels o f literacy, h igher rates o f c h i l d labor, gender inequities in access to pub l ic services, and l o w 
representation in decision-malung positions. Human pover ty i s also greater among Cambodian 
women than men across a l l economic groups." 

30. Women make s ign i f ican t contributions to the national economy and the incomes and we l l- 
be ing o f their households. Women comprise 54 percent o f the agr icu l ture and fisheries workers 
and the ir incomes prov ide more than half o f household expenditures. Within the context o f a shift 
t o a market economy and PSD, women have made s ign i f ican t gains in securing pa id employment 
in recent years. These gains have, however, been l im i t e d to the garments indus try whose 
immediate future i s uncertain. The garment sector employs re la t ive ly better-educated young 
women and a substantial number o f ru ra l households receive regular income transfers f r om their 
daughters. Outside o f agriculture and garments, women are p r im a r i l y self-employed in small, 
in fo rma l enterprises and comprise 49 percent o f self-employed r e t a i l traders. 
In add i t ion to 
cu l tu ra l ly prescribed notions o f "male" and "female" occupations, the lowe r levels o f l i teracy and 
education o f women make i t d i f f i c u l t f o r them to compete. L a c k o f access to, or con tro l over, 
produc t ive resources and services inc lud ing credit, land and l a n d titles, agr icu l tura l inputs and 
extension services are c r i t ica l gender issues. 

31 . 

A l though progress i s be ing made in responding to gender inequities in the social sectors, 
serious gaps remain. In education, wh i le there i s increasing gender equ i ty at the p r ima ry school 
leve l , severe disparities persist at h igher levels o f schooling, and the female c h i l d labor rate o f 50 
percent in the 14-17 age group i s considerably higher than the ma le c h i l d labor rate o f 36 percent. 
In health, although progress i s be ing made in rebu i ld ing c l in ica l hea l th services, Cambodia's 
maternal mo r ta l i ty rate remains one o n the highest in the reg ion at 437 per 100,000 l i v e births, 
suggesting the need f o r increased attention to reproductive hea l th and imp roved access to health 
in fo rma t ion and services. 

32. Women are under-represented in bo th elected and appointed positions as w e l l as in mid to 
high levels o f the c i v i l service. O n l y 8.5 percent o f the commune councilors and 12.2 percent o f 
Na t iona l Assembly members are women. This under-representation o f women i s d irec t ly related 
to the l o w number o f women candidates in party l i s t s . Cambodia's nascent lega l framework 
affords many rights to women yet most are unaware o f such rights. General weaknesses in the 
j u d i c i a l system together w i t h their l o w social status leave women w i t h l i t t l e lega l protection. As a 
result women are h i g h l y vulnerable to tra f f ick ing , domestic violence and rape. The lega l standing 
o f women in proper ty disputes i s also a concern. W h i l e some progress in formu la t ing po l ic ies 
p romo t ing gender equality has been achieved, mainstreaming gender continues t o b e a serious 
challenge, and the po l i t ica l w i l l to implement such policies remains weak.

PRIVATE  SECTOR'^ 

33. 

The pr iva te sector in Cambodia i s dominated b y the i n f o rm a l sector, w h c h accounts f o r 
over 80 percent o f non-pub l ic sector GDP and close to 90 percent o f employment. M u c h o f 
i n f o rm a l sector ac t iv i ty i s concentrated in agriculture. The i n f o rm a l indus tr ia l sector accounts for 
almost h a l f o f to ta l indus tr ia l output and supplies ma in ly the domestic market. 
I t has been 
estimated that more than 90 percent o f enterprises in Cambodia are sma l l (less than 100 
employees) operating en t ire ly in the in fo rma l sector. Some 7,000 pr iva te enterprises registered 
w i t h the Ministry o f Commerce constitute the fo rma l pr iva te sector. The f o rm a l pr iva te sector has 
been na r row ly focused on garments and tourism. Fore ign direct investment (FDI) has p layed an 
impor tan t ro le in developing the f o rm a l private sector and i s the m a i n source o f exports. However, 
since the late 1990s, FDI has been on a dec l in ing trend. The pr iva te sector i s constrained in i t s

managerial s k i l l s and; (v) l im i t e d access t o land, in fo rma t ion and compe t i t ive markets. 

34 . 
F i rm - leve l surveys reveal that complex registration and l icens ing procedures and 
associated fo rma l and in fo rma l charges are s ign i f ican t burdens. Because o f the high costs, 
enterprises have an incentive t o rema in in fo rma l to avo id these costs. Exporters comp la in that red 
tape associated w i t h export processing causes s ign i f ican t delays. Registered enterprises also face 
an increased tax burden ow i n g to the country’s l im i t e d tax base, wh i le smugg l ing f r om 
ne ighbor ing countries negatively impacts on domestic manufacturers. Poor transport infrastructure 
and uno f f ic ia l tolls, and the h i g h cost o f e lec tr ic i ty due to a l a c k o f generating capacity also 
increases the cost o f do ing business in Cambodia. L a n d tenure issues, due to the l o w leve l o f land 
titling, dissuades investment in agriculture, wh i le a lack o f access to credit, especially f o r Sma l l 
and M e d i um Enterprises (SMEs), constrains pr iva te sector growth. SMEs are also constrained b y 
a l a c k o f a development strategy f o r the sector, weak entrepreneurial s k i l l s and accounting 
standards, and l im i t e d access to market in fo rma t ion and technology. 

35 . 
The RS reiterates the ro le o f the pr iva te sector as the main engine o f growth, employment 
generation and pover ty reduction, and comm i ts the Government to addressing the above 
deficiencies. PSD has taken o n an added sense o f urgency in the context o f the phasing out o f the 
MFA quota system, the need to raise competitiveness in light o f WTO accession, and the high 
rates o f unemployment among the new entrants t o the labor market. In response, the Government 
has launched a comprehensive PSD program w i t h a focus o n trade facilitation, SM E development 
and enhancing pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in infrastructure (PPI) prov is ion . A number o f re forms have 
already been in troduced to reduce the cost and t ime o f export and impo r t transactions, remove 
disincentives f o r S M E formalization, and transparency in managing PPI. A ma jor challenge w i l l

ENVIRONMENT’3 

36. 

Environmental Management. Cambodia’s economy depends heav i ly o n agriculture, 
fisheries, and natural resources and i t s unique eco-system centered on the Ton le Sap Basin. Y e t 
environmental management in Cambodia i s weak and the lega l framework f o r environmental 
management does no t meet the country’s needs. In fo rma t ion and sector guidelines are lac lung on 
c ruc ia l aspects such as allowable forestry cut, fish yields, and groundwater resources. Poor 
stakeholder par t ic ipa t ion also weakens community-based management. The 
roles and 
responsibilities o f the environmental agencies at various levels need to be c lar i f ied , g iven that up 
t o 14 agencies are invo lved in the management o f the Ton le Sap Basin. Management capacities are 
pa r t icu la r ly weak at p rov inc ia l level, fo rc ing cruc ia l environmental management decisions to be 
made at the na t iona l level. The Government’s listing o f key environmental challenges inc lude : (i) 
decreasing forest cover, wh ich reduces b iod ivers i ty , increases erosion, accelerates r i v e r siltation, 
and worsens f lood ing ; (ii) untreated wastewater; (iii) unsustainable irr iga t ion ; ( iv) i n l a n d fisheries 
and coastal resources degradation; and (v) poor pro tec t ion o f b iod ivers i ty and protected areas.

Over 20 percent o f incomes o f poor households are sourced f r om the commons, ma in ly

development agenda since i t w i l l prov ide Cambodia w i t h the economies o f scale and opportunities

membership in the Association o f Southeast As ian Nations (ASEAN). Cambodia i s also pursuing 
other efforts to harmonize trade and investment policies in the context o f A S E A N and the A S E A N 
Free Trade Area (AFTA). Finally, w i t h the M e k o n g R ive r prom inen t ly defining the region’s water

MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

40. 

The medium-term grow th projections in the NPRS Annual Progress Report are realistic 
only assuming deep and consistent implementation of the structural reform agenda. Even taking 
implementation o f the r e f o rm agenda as the base scenario, annual GDP g row th i s no t expected to 
reach 6 percent until 2008, and the annual average g row th rate over the 2005-2008 pe r iod w i l l be 
o n the order o f 4.6 percent. This i s in sharp contrast w i t h the 1999-2002 period, in w h i c h annual 
GDP grow th averaged 6.8 percent. At the same time, as a small economy vulnerable to exogenous 
risk as we l l as opportunity, the med ium term macroeconomic ou t look i s subject to considerable 
uncertainty. 

41. 

The Cambodian economy entered a new phase in 2005 w i th the decline of 
the garment 
sector, wh ich had accounted fo r more than three-quarters of exports over the past several years, 
due to the term ina t ion of 
the quota system. The s lowdown i s expected to dampen g row th in 
services, and poss ib ly construction, but the impac t w i l l be somewhat offset by the tou r ism sector, 
w h i c h i s expected t o continue t o expand by more than 20 percent per annum f r o m 2005-2008. The 
performance o f the agr icu l tura l sector, acknowledged to be Cambodia’s comparative advantage, i s 
l i k e l y to improve modestly over the nex t fou r years, g iven a robust r e f o rm program. However , the 
variance o f g row th at the sub-sectoral leve l has been high, and concerns about l o w p roduc t iv i ty in 
crops and depletion o f resources in fisheries are l i k e l y to dominate the prospects f o r the med ium 
term. Thus, even w i t h the r e v i v a l o f reform, per capita gross national income i s expected t o 
improve on ly modestly f r om US$320 in 2005 to US$340 in 2008 (Table 1).

The slowdown in growth, however, is not expected to cause either a balance of payments 
o r a f isca l cr is is . The current account balance ( inc lud ing o f f i c i a l transfers) i s expected to improve 
over the med ium te rm as the slight deterioration in the trade balance (as impor ts o f garment-related 
produc t ion materials w i l l slow w i t h the decline in the demand f o r garment exports) i s more than 
offset b y g row th in tour ism and some grow th in private and o f f i c i a l transfers. Domestic investment 
i s expected t o recover over the per iod wh i le in f la t ion i s l i k e l y to rema in l o w and steady. O n the 
f isca l side, the Government has comm i t ted to a re fo rm program that promises to increase the 
revenue-to-GDP r a t i o modestly f r om 12 percent in 2005 to 13.1 percent in 2008. With a steady 
expend ture- to-GDP ratio, the overa l l f isca l de f ic i t ( inc lud ing grants) w i l l improve f r om 3.8 
percent in 2005 to 2 .9 percent in 2008. 

43. 

However, strengthening revenue mobilization in the context of an improved pub l ic 
f inanc ia l management system is c r i t ica l to enable debt servicing as we l l as implementation of the 
Government’s national development strategy. Steady improvements in revenue po l icy and 
administration are necessary to ma in ta in debt sustainability. Strengthened tax and customs 
administration, coupled w i t h more compe t i t ive procurement and greater oversight over 
government contracts, w i l l improve revenue p roduc t iv i ty and expenditure e f f ic iency , b o t h o f 
wh ich are needed to enable the Government to fund i t s pover ty reduc t ion program. 

44. 

A strong program of structural re fo rm -as articulated i n the Govemment’s RS-is needed 
to boost grow th rates over the coming several years and beyond, given the unfavorable pr iva te 
sector environment. The Government has launched a comprehensive PSD program, focus ing o n 
attracting investment, generating employment, trade fac i l i ta t ion , SME promotion, and f inanc ia l 
sector development. The Government i s also comm i t ted to a more dynamic ru ra l sector by 
developing an agr icu l tura l program that improves access to land; improves water management; 
strengthens linkages to markets; reduces costs through greater infrastructure investments; and 
develops a better framework f o r the de l ivery o f demand-driven services to enable farmers to 
respond to market opportunities. Imp lemen ta t ion o f these measures w o u l d broaden the g row th 
base and have d irec t impacts on poverty reduction. Assuming r a p i d imp lemen ta t ion o f these k e y 
structural and sectoral reforms, and development o f programs to imp lemen t others, inc lud ing lega l 
and jud ic ia l , pub l ic f inanc ia l management, and c i v i l service re form , rea l GDP g row th i s expected 
to recover gradua l ly over the med ium term. 

45. 

The downside risks inherent in a non-reform scenario are considerable. Fa i lure t o rev ive 
the r e f o rm p rog ram cou ld see g row th stagnating at 3 to 3.5 percent over the m e d i um term. At the 
same time, debt dynamics are sensitive to g row th rates over the med ium term. The l a c k o f 
structural r e f o rm w o u l d undermine the g row th rates needed to underp in sustainable debt servicing. 
A fa i lure to imp rove revenues w o u l d further undermine sustainable debt serv ic ing and w o u l d l im i t

DEBT AND CREDITWORTHINESS 

46. 

The most recent debt sustainability analysis concludes that in the medium-term 
Cambodia’s debt stock and f low burden is sustainable, provided reforms, especially on the f isca l 
f ron t , are im~1emen ted . l~ Sens i t iv i ty analysis shows that g iven concessional rescheduling and a 
baseline r e f o rm scenario, total pub l ic sector debt-to-GDP (in net present value or NPV terms) 
w o u l d decline to about 31.7 percent in 2008 and 26 percent in 2013. Under a non-re form scenario 
in wh ich l o n g term GDP g row th i s considerably be low the baseline scenario, the NPV o f pub l ic 
debt to GDP w o u l d on ly deteriorate to about 37 percent in 2008 and 34 percent in 2013.15 

47. 

Cambod ia ’spub l ic extemal debt of ~ $ 3 . 1 b i l l ion in 2004 has an estimated nominal value 
of 67.9 percent of GDP (56.8 percent in NPV terms). Domestic pub l ic debt, a l l denominated in 
r ie l , represented l e s s than 5 percent o f GDP. Nea r ly two- th irds o f total external pub l ic debt i s owed 
to the U n i t e d States and the Russian Federation. As other external debt i s h i g h l y concessional, debt 
sustainability i s a func t ion o f the u l t ima te terms o f the ongo ing restructuring talks w i t h b o t h 
countries. I t i s possible that b i la tera l agreement cou ld be reached in 2005. I f a concessional

DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND STRATEGY 

50. 

The Government’s development strategy, as reflected in the RS (Box l), draws o n the 
SEDP I1 and the NPRS and i s a synthesis o f pr ior i t ies o f these documents.16 The SEDP I1 i s a 
comprehensive development program focusing on promo t ing growth, reg iona l integration, and 
reducing poverty. I t serves as the Government’s pr inc ipa l p lann ing document. NPRS i s closely 
based on SEDP I1 and elaborates the pover ty reduction agenda, p rov id ing a framework f o r support 
b y in tema t iona l development partners and a comprehensive set o f mon i to r ing indicators towards 
achieving the CMDGs . The NPRS iden t i f ies eight p r io r i ty pover ty reduc t ion outcomes, each w i t h 
detailed actions: (i) ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability; (ii) im p r o v i n g r u r a l l ive l ihoods ; (iii) 
expanding j o b opportunities; ( iv) imp rov ing capabilities; (v) strengthening ins t i tu t ions and 
imp rov ing governance; (v i) reduc ing vu lnerab i l i ty and strengthening social inc lus ion ; (v i i ) 
promo t ing gender equality; and (v i i i ) focusing on popu la t ion through maternal health, increased 
access t o education, and r u r a l opportunities.

environment t o implement the strategy, and o n p romo t ing economic g row th through agriculture

and human resource development. Wh i le , conceptually sound, the RS curren t ly lacks an action 
plan, and i s in need o f p r io r i t iza t ion and costing. T o imp lemen t the development v is ion set out in 
the RS, the Government and development partners have agreed to prepare a single p lann ing 
document, the Na t iona l Strategic Development P lan (NSDP), f o r the per iod 2006-2010. 

B. 

RESOURCE MOBILIZATION AND INVESTMENT 

52. 
The NPRS and RS are predicated o n an average annual rea l GDP g row th rate o f 6-7 
percent. This w o u l d require a substantial increase in the p roduc t iv i ty and volume o f investment, 
f r om a projected 20 percent o f GDP in 2004. Moreover, the actions and investments enumerated 
in the NPRS ca l l f o r f inanc ing in excess o f US$1.5 b i l l i o n over 2003-2005. 
In the face o f 
increased compe t i t ion f o r concessionary aid, there i s then a need to redouble e f for ts to mob i l ize 
domestic revenues to finance grow th and pover ty reduction. As ind ica ted in the RS, this wou ld 
require a significant e f fo r t to improve the co l lec t ion o f tax and non-tax revenues, by reduc ing 
corrup t ion and tax evasion, dismantling the structure o f tax exemptions, broadening the tax base 
and strengthening tax and customs administration. A complementary p r i o r i t y i s to improve the 
effectiveness o f spending b y l i n k i n g expenditures more t igh t ly w i t h p r i o r i t y outcomes. There i s 
also a related need t o imp rove the investment climate and reduce the costs o f do ing business f o r 
the pr iva te sector. 

C. 

THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE 

53. 
Ex terna l assistance has contributed to the imp lemen ta t ion o f a l l ma jor pub l ic sector 
development projects in Cambodia. F r om 1992 to 2003, O D A disbursements to the country 
reached US$5 .2 b i l l ion , w i t h 28 percent f r om mu l t i la tera l sources, 64 percent f r om b i la tera l 
sources, and 8 percent f r om NGOs. Grants account f o r 80 percent o f O D A . In 2003, about 
US$546 m i l l i o n in O D A was disbursed, equivalent to near ly 8 percent o f GDP. Pledges made 
during the annual Consultative Group (CG) meetings have increased f r om US$471 m i l l i o n in 1999 
to US$548 m i l l i o n in 2000 and US$635 m i l l i o n in 2002. Based o n a rev ised de f in i t ion o f ODA , 
donors pledged US$504 m i l l i o n in 2004 .” O n a per capita basis, Cambodia has received 
s ign i f ican t ly more O D A than other low - income countries during the past decade. Aid in f lows 
were m a i n l y used to imp rove health and education, r e b u i l d physical infrastructure, and f o r 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity building. G iven Cambodia’s substantial f inanc ia l needs, i t s l im i t e d capacity 
to mob i l ize domestic revenues, and the narrow pr iva te sector base, i t w i l l continue to depend 
heav i ly o n O D A in the med ium term. However, measures to boost external resources need to b e 
matched b y improvements in the efficiency, in teg r i ty and effectiveness w i t h wh ich these resources 
are used.

A k e y p r i o r i t y i s strengthening the capacity and effectiveness o f the Government in a id 
management l i n k e d to the CMDGs , so as to achieve greater ownership and development impact. 
W h i l e a i d coord ina t ion i s the mandate o f the Counc i l f o r the Development o f Cambodia (CDC), 
there i s need to strengthen links and harmonize procedures w i t h other key agencies concerned w i t h

ex is t ing weaknesses, s ign i f ican t portions o f O D A are handled off-budget and are therefore d i f f i c u l t 
to account for . There i s also a need f o r imp roved donor aid coord ina t ion t o enhance development

has fragmented assistance and l im i t e d i t s impact. The m u l t i p l i c i t y o f implementation and f inanc ing 
structures has undermined the development o f government systems and has increased the costs of 
p rov id ing assistance to Cambodia. Furthermore, d i f fe r ing p o l i c y prescriptions by development 
partners have sometimes undermined the achievement o f sustainable and u n i f i e d development 
policies. 

55. 
A number o f in i t ia t ives are, however, curren t ly underway to promote better development 
partnerships. These inc lude measures t o imp lemen t t h e Rome Dec lara t ion on Harmon iza t ion ; the 
restructuring o f the existing Government-donor Technical W o r k i n g Groups (TWGs) at the sector 
and thematic leve l ; the harmonization o f country strategies by ADB, DFID, the UN and the W o r l d 
Bank and the coordination o f their programs based on comparative advantage; and a greater 
reliance o n sector w ide development programs. ADB, Japan and the W o r l d Bank have worked 
closely to strengthen the synergies among their programs at the operational leve l . The 
Government has also collaborated w i t h the ADB and the W o r l d Bank in preparing a report on 
Standard Operating Procedures fo r imp roved implementation o f donor projects. The preparation 
o f the N SD P 2006-2010 also provides an oppor tun i ty f o r ensuring greater development impac t b y 
increasing government and donor harmon iza t ion around a un i f ied development framework t o

ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 

56. 
The SEDP I1 and NPRS processes in troduced new approaches and themes t o development 
p lann ing in Cambodia, inc lud ing : (i) open and extensive par t ic ipa t ion o f stakeholders; (ii) 
engagement o f v i r tua l ly a l l l ine agencies in the process; (iii) greater focus on key crosscutting 
themes, inc lud ing governance, pub l ic sector performance, and PSD; and ( iv) use o f agreed 
indicators l inked to the CMDG s to mon i to r progress in pover ty reduction. 

57. 
D u r i n g the first quarter o f 2004, a process to assess the f i r s t year o f NPRS imp lemen ta t ion 
was j o i n t l y undertaken b y the Government and key donors. Pr inc ipa l observations on the SEDP I1 
and NPRS processes included: (i) weaknesses in costing and pr ior i t iza t ion , (ii) l a c k o f adequate 
linkages between strategies and budgets and thus the need fo r a MTEF; (iii) need t o broaden 
government responsibility, owne rshp and coordination; ( iv) need to build na t iona l capacity f o r 
pover ty mon i to r ing as w e l l as evaluation o f k e y programs and policies; and (v) fur ther elaboration 
o f pro-poor ru ra l and infrastructure development strategies. Development partners o f ten took the 
lead in developing the strategies, reduc ing government input and pr ior i t iza t ion . 

58. 
The RS represents a serious attempt b y the Government to demonstrate ownership o f the 
development process. I t builds o n a sound diagnosis o f the causes o f pover ty and iden t i f ies 
governance as the most impor tan t pre-cond i t ion t o economic development. The RS, however, 
appears ambitious in i t s g row th targets g iven the l i k e l y s ign i f ican t negative impac t o f the phasing 
out o f the MFA on grow th-w i th 
the la t ter projected to s low down to 2.3 percent in 2005-and 
the 
l a c k o f any immediate alternative to garments as a dr iver o f growth. 

I V . THE WORLD BANK GROUP IN CAMBODIA-BUILDING ON EXPERIENCE 

5 9 . 

The present CAS reflects lessons learned since the last CAS was prepared in 2000. In 
do ing so, i t has benefited f r om the findings o f a C l ien t Survey in 2003 and a Ju ly 2004 O E D 
rev iew o f the process leading to the produc t ion o f the NPRS (Cambodia's first PRSP). I t has also 
drawn o n a Country Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew (CPPR); a 2000 Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion 
(CAE); project-specific reports; and a C A S Comp le t ion Report (CCR) that rev iews progress 
against the last CAS (Attachment 1). 

- 1 6 - 

60. 
The f i n a l source of lessons was f r om extensive consultations o n strengths and weaknesses 
observed to date and new coun try strategy priorities, h e l d w i t h the Government, other donors, c i v i l 
society and the pr iva te sector and conducted in partnership w i t h ADB, DFID, and the UN system 
over the course o f 2003-2004 (Box 2). These assessments pa in t a reasonably consistent picture of 
the strengths and weaknesses o f the strategy o f the W o r l d Bank Group since 2000. The result i s a 
re la t ive ly high degree o f confidence in the lessons learned and the pr ior i t ies f o r future 
development cooperation between the Bank Group and Cambodia. 

61. 
By and large, the Bank was able to accomplish most of the ind iv idua l tasks se t out in the 
2000 CAS, although w i t h some delays and slippages. These inc luded helping the Government to 
prepare k e y po l ic ies (e.g., the Hea l th Sector Strategy, the NPRS, and a p o l i c y and lega l framework 
f o r land management); and imp rov ing sectoral indicators (e.g., increased percentage o f passable 
roads; expanded access to water and sanitation). In addition, the W o r l d Bank Group was also able 
to achieve some goals that were no t anticipated at the t ime the C A S was w r i t ten ( fo r example, 
responding rap id ly and e f fec t ive ly to a request fo r assistance in the aftermath o f the devastating 
floods o f 2000). 

62. 
However, these achievements d id no t appear to add up to a s ign i jcan t impact on broader 
development outcomes. The rev iew by the W o r l d Bank concluded that w h i l e the foundations o f 
the last CAS-governance, 
service de l ivery and investment climate-were appropriate and rema in 
so today, good de l ivery o f the program did no t lead to the broader change in outcomes that were 
anticipated at the outset. The incidence o f pover ty does no t seem to have declined; the base f o r 
economic g row th continues to be h i g h l y concentrated and fragile; corrup t ion remains widespread 
and systemic; and, w i t h a few exceptions, social development indicators have shown l i t t l e sign o f 
improvement. T h e p rog ram o f analytical and advisory activities (AAA), l i k e the lend ing po r t fo l io , 
cou ld have benefited f r om more focus and selectivity (a prob lem n ow addressed by the move to 
the AAA cyc le approach, whereby studies are chosen as part o f a process lead ing i n t o advisory 
wo rk and lend ing operations). The CCR also concluded that the pr imary analytical gap recognized 
b y the country team i n retrospect was better analysis o f h ow governance problems manifest 
themselves in p o l i c y development and implementation. 

- 17 - 

63. 
In terms o f how the W o r l d Bank approached imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy, the 
comm i tmen t in the C A S to work through strategic partnerships o n l y began to materialize late in 
the C A S period, in part because the planned expansion o f the W o r l d Bank's field presence did not 
beg in until FY02. This impression was con f irmed in the C l ien t Survey, in wh ich the Government, 
other donors, the pr iva te sector and NGOs reported perce iv ing the W o r l d Bank as overstretched 
and lack ing the focus needed to be f u l l y effective. Overall, the conclusions o f the CCR are quite 
s i m i l a r to those drawn prev ious ly in the 2000 C A E (Box 3), po in t ing to the h i g h leve l o f 
in trac tab i l i ty o f many o f these country-contextual barriers to a id effectiveness. 

64. 

Projects implemented by the Wo r ld Bank faced pa r t icu la r problems in three sectors 
(namely forestry, demobilization, and economic management capacity bu i ld ing) . In each case, the 
roo t cause o f the problems has been poor governance. Imp lemen ta t ion has suffered either because 
Bank preparation and implementation have proceeded w i thou t evidence o f any government 
champions fo r re form , or indeed because the incentives f o r resisting r e f o rm were extremely strong. 

65. 

As the forestry reform agenda -ag reed by Govemment and donors in 1997/98--faced 
problems in implementation, prompting donors to exit the sector, the Wo r ld Bank's support fo r 
ra t iona l iza t ion of 
the concession system became a foca l po in t fo r debates regarding forest 
management. In the absence o f a common understanding o f the r e f o rm agenda and the ro le o f the 
W o r l d Bank-supported project, the dialogue between the W o r l d Bank and the Government o n one 
hand, and the W o r l d Bank and NGOs o n the other, became increasingly contentious. Experience in 
forestry suggests that the W o r l d Bank needs to ensure that i t s support to re fo rm i s part o f a w e l l 
defined, strategic approach based on consensus among development partners. In the case o f 
par t icu lar ly challenging reforms, ma in ta in ing consensus requires that the strategic approach be 
rev is i ted frequently, and adjusted as necessary, to integrate increased understanding o f the 
obstacles to and opportunities f o r reform. 

66. 

I n other unsatisfactory projects-notably 
the Demobilization and Reintegration Project- 
the ma in lesson is that, under conditions of weak govemance, n o m 1 supervision systems need to 
be beefed up i f t h e Bank is not to face an unacceptably h igh level o f f iduc iary risk. In the case o f 
demobilization, in wh ich the W o r l d Bank l e d a donor group f inanc ing the costs o f demob i l iza t ion 
and reintegration o f veterans, in tens i f ied supervision l e d to a declaration o f misprocurement and 
the program stalled. With very l im i t e d transparency and weak accountability widespread in 
Cambodia, the W o r l d B a n k cannot leave i t to government systems, many o f wh ich are very young, 
t o carry the burden o f protecting investments against leakages. As such, the W o r l d Bank has 
in i t ia ted a detailed f iduc iary rev iew o f i t s operations, w h i c h w i l l i n f o rm the design o f much more 
extensive and care fu l mon i to r ing systems. 

67. 

F ina l ly the experience of 
the Economic and Pub l ic Sector Capac i ty-Bu i ld ing Pro jec t 
implies that projects should only be introduced when there is a consensus shared w i t h the 
Govemment, regarding the necessity of p r i o r reforms. In this project, imp lemen ta t ion was delayed 
because there was n o progress on the reforms wh ich had been established as preconditions f o r the 
project. Be fore designing a program, there i s a need to make a realistic appraisal o f the degree o f 

- 1 8 - 

h igh- leve l commitment to the reforms that are agreed. When such an assessment o f government 
ownership i s missing, the W o r l d Bank i s better advised to seek to develop i t through partnerships, 
AAA wo rk and Technical Assistance (TA) fo r capacity and consensus building be fore p lann ing 
s ign i f ican t lend ing projects. 

68. 
These j n d i n g s are broadly i n l ine w i th those found in reviews of development processes, 
and the effectiveness of development assistance, in Low Income Countries Under Stress (L ICUS ) 
(Box 4) . Cambodia has had a d i f f i c u l t past, re turn ing to the international commun i ty o n l y s l igh t ly 
over a decade ago. The W o r l d B a n k Group w i l l thus need to be comm i t ted to and engaged in 
consistent, long- term dialogue w i t h the Government i f d i f f i c u l t governance issues are to be 
tackled. I t w i l l be impor tan t to develop a clear understanding o f the social and p o l i t i c a l dynamics 
o f governance and r e f o rm in the Cambodian context and to adopt a realistic and pragmatic 
approach in addressing these issues. 

69. 
Re f lec t ing o n the successes and failures o f the per iod since the last CAS was written, the 
W o r l d Bank Group has drawn a number o f key lessons f o r the next CAS period: 

0 The need to focus on govemance throughout the country program. This reflects the 
observation that a poor governance environment (weak capacity, the strong b l o c k i n g in f luence 
o f vested interests operating through a system based on patronage, weak lega l pro tec t ion f o r 
the poor, and a pr iva te sector impeded b y high levels o f bureaucratic in terven t ion and 
uno f f ic ia l charges) has been the primary imped imen t to greater impact, b o t h o f the program o f 
the W o r l d Bank Group and o f development po l ic ies more generally. The need to focus o n 
governance i s re in forced b y the Government's ow n analysis and statements; governance is , f o r 
example, at the core o f the RS. In Cambodia's case, i t also brings the coun try strategy i n t o 
alignment w i t h the in terna l ins t i tu t iona l procedures fo r performance mon i to r ing and 
performance-based resource a l loca t ion w i t h i n the W o r l d Bank Group. Cambodia's scores f o r 
three o f the f i v e governance ind ica tors remained large ly the same or dec l ined between 1999 
and 2003, w i t h slight increases in o n l y tw o dimensions (the top l e f t quadrant in F igu re 1). In 
comparison w i t h other IDA countries, Cambodia i n 2003 did as w e l l o n macro, structural and 
social equity issues, but scored less w e l l than the average f o r IDA recipients in a l l f i v e 

- 19 - 

governance criteria. As a result, the W o r l d Bank's overa l l IDA a l loca t ion f o r assistance to 
Cambodia has been reduced. I n comparison to 2002 when the W o r l d Bank pledged US$70 
m i l l i o n , at the 2004 C G Mee t ing i t was able to pledge on ly US$45 m i l l i o n per year. The CAS 
i s designed to he lp the Government improve i t s governance indicators in the C P I A ratings so 
that in the future, as Cambodia implements the program l a i d out in the RS, i t w i l l be able to 
access a s ign i f ican t ly higher volume o f IDA resources. 

0 

"Demand side" approaches to good governance (bu i ld ing broad constituencies f o r re fo rm 
through outreach t o c i v i l society and the pr iva te sector, e.g., through the prov is ion o f 
in fo rma t ion and organizational tools) are an essential complement to more common "supply 
side" approaches t o good governance, but one that the W o r l d B a n k ( l ike most donors) has 
large ly neglected t o date. 
In the nex t CAS period, the Bank w i l l strive t o establish the 
p r inc ip le that the intended beneficiaries o f W o r l d Bank assistance have the r i g h t to know what 
i s prov ided to the ir government and how i t i s used. The goa l i s t o close the accountability 
loop , ensuring that the Cambodian people are able to h o l d the Government-and 
the W o r l d 
Bank-accountable 
f o r the assistance provided; and that the Government, f o r i t s part, comes to 
see i tse l f as accountable to i t s citizens, and no t just to external donors.

The need to improve donor coordination and partnerships. Poor governance and poor donor 
behavior have been closely related. Poor governance has encouraged donors to adopt short- 
term approaches to development effectiveness (e.g., stand-alone projects o f ten managed by 
fore ign consultants) and enabled them to get away w i t h uncoordinated aid. Conversely, poor 
donor coordination and inadequate outreach t o c i v i l society have accentuated the problems o f 
weak governance (by impos ing high transaction costs f o r a l l stakeholders; p rov id ing 
con f l ic t ing messages to the Government and underm in ing the evo lu t ion o f a government- 
owned v is ion o f development; and c los ing o f f opportunities f o r learning, scaling up o r 
building e f fec t ive constituencies to tackle the most challenging reforms). The CAE , and to an 
extent also the OED evaluation o f the NPRS process, h igh l igh t the need f o r TA to be care fu l ly 
designed so as to re f lec t and contribute to ex is t ing ins t i tu t iona l arrangements. The l im i ta t ions 
o f project implementation units are n ow recognized: m o v i n g beyond this insight i s however 
d i f f i c u l t and calls fo r tailored approaches. W h i l e much progress has been made, sector 
coordination arrangements are s t i l l at a f a i r l y early stage in Cambodia. (The te rm "sector-wide 
approach" o r SWAP i s used in this CAS as i t i s understood in Cambodia, namely to imply that 
there i s a Government-owned sector strategy and program around wh ich the ma jo r i ty o f donor 
support i s planned. I t does not, as in some other countries, necessarily imply reliance o n 
coun try systems.) The W o r l d Bank began to adopt a partnership approach in 2002; t h i s 
evo lved rap id ly in 2003 and continues t o develop, but more i s needed. T h i s has been and w i l l 
continue to b e facilitated by the much-enlarged f i e l d presence. The W o r l d Bank Coun try 
O f f ice has expanded f r om 9 to 28 staff members ( inc lud ing a significant intake o f na t iona l 
professionals) over the last tw o years. 

0 The need f o r a clear focus on results. This requires a number o f interrelated changes, 
beg inn ing w i t h greater selectivity. T o be effective, the W o r l d Bank needs to establish, and 
stick to, thought-through cr i ter ia f o r choosing what i t w i l l and w i l l no t take o n w i t h the 
resources available. I f the CAS document i s to be used as a t o o l f o r mon i to r ing results, there 
i s also a need to build stronger, results-focused cross-sectoral teams. The numerous sectoral 
indicators and outcome areas in the previous CAS discouraged cross-sectoral approaches in 
implementation. F ina l ly , results-based performance necessitates a clear de f in i t ion in the C A S 
o f the expected relationship between the W o r l d Bank inputs and activities, intermediate 
progress indicators, and outcomes (Figure 2).

These three themes-potential 
impact o n governance as the unifying c r i te r ion f o r selecting 
activities, wo rk ing through strategic partnerships as the approach, and a focus o n results-will be 
used t o explain the content o f the program. The f o l l ow i n g chapter elaborates on the sectors, 
issues, m i x o f instruments, and M&E arrangements in reference to these three over-arching 
themes. Attachment 2 presents the program and the expected resu l ts o f t h s CAS . 

V. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. 

THE GOVERNANCE CHALLENGE, THE CMDGs AND SELECTIVITY 

CRITERIA 

71. 
I n designing the new CAS, a strong se t of selectivity c r i te r ia has been rigorously applied 
to the choice of new activities. O f the various cr i ter ia that have in f luenced the selection o f 
activities, inc lud ing the requirement that activities are f i rm l y embedded i n the Government’s 
Rectangular Strategy and are in areas o f W o r l d Bank comparative advantage, an impor tan t cr i ter ia 
i s that the CAS should display a thematic focus and structural coherence. I f the various activities 
are to add up to more than the sum o f their parts, then they need to re f lec t a un i fy ing , under ly ing 
structural log ic . 

72. 
Central to this CAS is the fact that poor govemance is the fundamental brake on Bank 
Group effectiveness and the achievement of development outcomes in Cambodia. The focus o n 
governance i s thus the primary f i l t e r to guide the selection o f issues and instruments. There are 
tw o parts to this governance focus: 

0 First, the Bank should choose to w o r k in those sectors in wh ich govemance constraints are the 
c r i t ica l limiting factor, and in wh ich these governance constraints have s ign i f ican t strategic 
importance f o r the overa l l na t iona l agenda (as defined, f o r example, by the ir importance in 
retarding progress towards the CMDGs) . 

0 Second, the Bank should d i f feren t ia te between sectors (in terms o f the l e v e l and f o rm o f 
resources allocated), based o n an assessment o f the strength o f government comm i tmen t to 
r e f o rm Where comm i tmen t i s apparent, the Bank w i l l support a defined r e f o rm agenda and 
iden t i f ied champions f o r r e f o rm w i t h s ign i f ican t loan and grant resources, inc lud ing fast- 
disbursing PRSCs. Where such commitment has yet to develop, the Bank w i l l seek to foster a 
momentum f o r r e f o rm p r im a r i l y through the deployment o f analytical and advisory services, 
donor coordination, and well-designed TA. Choosing to focus o n sectors in w h i c h there 
appears to be evidence o f government commitment clearly makes good sense in terms o f a 
results-based CAS ; those sectors w i t h domestic champions are more l i k e l y t o move ahead, and 
to deliver on CAS outcomes, than those w i thou t champions. 

73. 
O n the basis o f these first tw o governance-related criteria, the B a n k G roup w i l l focus o n 
the f o l l ow i n g fou r areas o f governance reforms in t h s CAS: 

0 Seek to improve the environment f o r PSD, o n the grounds that the pr iva te sector w i l l need to 
p lay the central ro le in ach iev ing poverty-reducing g row th and because i t i s clear that 
governance constraints (cumbersome, non-transparent and corruption-prone 
lega l and 
regulatory frameworks w h i c h impose unnecessary costs o n f irms) are curren t ly the p r ima ry 
obstacle to competitiveness, investment, employment and p r o f i t in Cambodia. Par t icu lar ly in a 
pos t -MFA w o r l d in w h i c h garment-led g row th i s l i k e l y to s low or reverse, at least i n i t i a l l y 
Cambodia cannot a f fo rd t o continue to put obstacles in the way o f economic d ivers i f ica t ion 
and expansion. 

- 22 - 

Continue to engage in natura l resource management (NRM) on the grounds that secure 
access t o l a n d and transparent management o f national resources in the pub l ic interest are o f 
v i ta l d irec t importance to Cambodia's ru ra l ma jor i ty ; and because the ma jor constraints upon 
the sustainable and pro-poor management o f such resources are roo ted in weak transparency o f 
state processes and a l a c k o f accountability on the part o f state actors. 

Support PFM reform because fundamental weaknesses in PFM constitute the primary 
bottleneck to improved de l ivery o f basic services to the poor . I t i s clear that poor governance 
-- as w e l l as a lack o f transparency and accountability in the co l lec t ion and allocation o f pub l ic 
finances, the ins t i tu t iona l iza t ion o f rent-seelung in service de l ivery as a consequence o f the 
system-wide inadequacy o f pub l ic sector salaries -- i s central to the problems in the de l ivery o f 
those services needed to meet basic needs and accumulate human capital. 

Continue t o support decentralization, and complement this with additional interventions 
designed to promote cittzens' partnerships for better governance. Decentralization has the 
potential t o improve governance across a broad range o f state functions, b y bringing decisions 
about p lann ing and budgeting closer to those affected, and shortening the l i n k s in the chain o f 
accountability. However, rea l iz ing this po ten t ia l requires sustained support to the institutions 
and processes o f loca l governance. Increasingly, the Bank w i l l seek to complement support to 
the "supply side" o f governance w i t h complementary interventions wh ich build up (w i t h 
in fo rma t ion and ins t i tu t iona l development) the capacity o f citizens, i n d i v i d u a l l y and in c i v i l 
society organizations, t o h o l d po l i t ic ians and government o f f ic ia ls accountable f o r p rob i ty and 
effectiveness i n the performance o f their duties. 

74. 

Thus, draw ing on lessonsffom experience in Cambodia and i n other L ICUS , the Bank w i l l 
approach the design and delivery of AAA services w i th the p r ima ry goals of constructing shared 
understanding of and commitment to a reform program. In recent years, this approach has been 
used successfully in Cambodia w i t h respect to PSD (in w h i c h an investment c l ima te report has l e d 
i n t o the de f in i t ion o f a PSD r e f o rm agenda); and pub l ic f inanc ia l management (in wh ich the 
IFAPER generated findings wh ich prov ided the basis f o r an agreed P F M r e f o rm program, 
launched b y the P r ime Minister in December 2004). Cambodia i s at an earlier stage o n t h i s 
con t inuum w i t h regard to land management (a Poverty and Soc ia l Impac t Ana lys is (PSIA) on 
social land concessions and other AAA w o r k on land issues are be ing used in an e f fo r t to develop 
government comm i tmen t to well-managed and transparent l a n d titling and land red is tr ibu t ion 
programs); and decentralization (in wh ich a consor t ium o f donors are supporting the development 
o f a government-led v is ion and strategy fo r sub-national government). 

75. 

These areas of govemance-the creation of an enabling environment for pr iva te sector 
investment and employment, improved management of na tura l resources, increased transparency, 
eficiency and pro-poor bias 
in pub l ic f inanc ia l management, and decentralization and 
accoun tab i l i ty -a re a l l f i rm l y embedded in the RS. The choice o f these areas i s no t intended to 
suggest that other aspects o f governance ( fo r example, strengthening the Na t iona l Assembly) are 
any less important. N o r does the choice o f activities in this C A S im p l y that governance i s the o n l y 
development challenge in Cambodia. However, as i s increasingly clear f r om popular po l i t ica l 
debate in Cambodia and f r om numerous pieces o f analysis (conducted b o t h b y the Bank Group and 
b y others), good governance i s an impor tan t precond i t ion to g row th and sustainable pover ty 
reduction, w i thou t wh ich l i t t l e progress can be expected. Re f lec t ing the conclusions o f the CAE , 
CCR and other reviews, the W o r l d Bank Group i s thus attempting to bring a much more rigorous 
assessment o f the po l i t ica l dynamics f o r and against p o l i c y change t o bear o n i t s decisions 
regarding w h i c h sectors to support and how . 

76 . 

The focus on govemance in this CAS also provides some guidance to wha t w i l l n o t be 
included in the Bank Group's program , and h ow i t w i l l approach certain problems. The basic 
premise unde r ly ing the choice o f sectors i s that they are impor tan t f o r pover ty reduction; that 
governance issues are c r i t ica l to improvements in sectoral performance; and that the W o r l d Bank 

- 23 - 

Group thinks i t i s in a pos i t ion to help address these governance issues. T h e Bank w i l l engage in 
those sectors in w h c h there are credible s i g n s o f a domestic leadership fo r reform. Where there i s 
n o such ind ica t ion o f ownership, the Bank w i l l no t comm i t significant lend ing resources, but w i l l 
instead adopt an intermediate approach: i t w i l l either: (i) await evidence o f pos i t ive change, and/or 
(ii) deploy AAA in an e f fo r t to build the in fo rma t ion base and partnerships necessary to in i t ia te 
re form , and/or (iii) support the development o f demand-side pressures f o r re fo rm b y building the 
capacity o f citizens and c i v i l society organizations to press claims f o r social accountability (in part, 
b y putting in place mechanisms to prov ide intended beneficiaries o f W o r l d Bank-financed projects 
w i t h the in fo rma t ion that w i l l enable them to h o l d the Govemment, and the W o r l d Bank, 
accountable f o r management and results). 

77. With respect to WR fo r example, the W o r l d Bank w i l l f o l l ow a three-pronged strategy. 
First, i t w i l l address L JR i s s u e s under each o f the other fou r governance objectives (such as PSD 
and land) i f such issues become s ign i f ican t constraints f o r attaining those objectives. Second, i t 
w i l l understand better the needs o f the poor f o r jus t ice and h ow they are curren t ly be ing served, f o r 
example b y alternative forms o f dispute reso lu t ion systems, and aim to strengthen those systems. 
And f ina l ly , i f the W o r l d Bank sees some signs o f commitment and ownership o n the 
Govemment’s side to tackle the system-wide r e f o rm o f state institutions, then i t w o u l d be open to 
p rov id ing support to that r e f o rm process. At the December 2004 C G Meeting, the Government 
agreed to pass some basic laws necessary f o r developing a sound lega l and j u d l c i a l system and f o r 
fighting corrup t ion (Box 5 ) . M a n y o f these laws have been under preparation fo r a l o n g t ime w i t h 
support f r om many donors, inc lud ing Japan and France. The preparation o f these laws i s be ing 
mon i tored closely b y the Govemment and donors and progress appears to be on track f o r the laws 
be ing passed during 2005. 

78. 

In add i t ion to the above governance theme, a second set o f cr i ter ia has been app l ied to 
ensure that the Bank w i l l support areas c r i t ica l to meeting the country’s MDGs. In these areas, 
W o r l d Bank support w i l l also b e integrated i n t o the Rectangular Strategy and w i l l be in areas o f 
W o r l d Bank comparative advantage. I t w i l l also fill c r i t ica l gaps in either strategy fo rmu la t ion or 
f inanc ing in those sectors or sub-sectors in wh ich due to l a c k o f the requ ired f inanc ing and/or 
strategy, Cambodia i s un l ike ly to meet the relevant CMDG(s) f o r that sector.

B. 

BANK GROUP ACTIVITIES AND PARTNERSHIPS 

P i l la r 1: Removing the Governance Constraints to Atta in ing the CMDGs 

80. 
The f i rs t p i l l a r of 
the CAS w i l l d irect Bank G roup activities to tackling the govemance 
constraints that hold back inclusive, sustainable growth and p ro -poo r sew ice delivery. I t w i l l 
attempt this through support to PSD, NRM, PFM and the extension o f decentralization reforms, 
coupled w i t h new mechanisms f o r establishing social accountability. 

81. 
To date, Cambodia’s economic g row th has been re la t ive ly r a p i d but h i g h l y concentrated, 
w i t h l im i t e d gains in terms o f employment or incomes f o r the poor. F o l l ow i n g the end o f MFA at 
the end o f 2004, g row th i s l i k e l y to s low . The challenge i s thus to cushion the f a l l and then 
accelerate the recovery in g row th rates, wh i le d ivers i fy ing the sources o f g row th so as to make i t 
more sustainable and inc lus ive . W h i l e there are a number o f barriers that must be overcome to 
achieve this goal ( inc lud ing poor infrastructure, a generally l o w leve l o f s k i l l s in the workforce, 
etc.), issues o f economic governance - inadequate lega l and inappropriate regu la tory frameworks, 
lack o f transparency and access to in forma t ion , and above a l l corrup t ion - are c lear ly c r i t ica l ly 
impor tan t in deterring pr iva te investment and reducing Cambodia’s competitiveness. In particular, 
the management o f Cambodia’s abundant natural resources curren t ly suffers f r om a pronounced 
lack o f transparency and accountability. As a result, Cambodia has benefited less than i t should 
f r om the exp lo i ta t ion o f these resources, and few o f these benefits have reached the poor. The 
Bank Group w i l l address b o t h (i) the governance constraints to pr iva te sector-led economic 
growth; and (ii) the specific issues o f governance in NRM, w i t h a focus in the la t ter case o n state 
land management and ach iev ing security o f access to resources f o r poor r u r a l households. 

82. 
At present, l o w leve ls o f transparency and accountability in the pub l ic sector, combined 
w i t h l a c k o f resources and capacity, result in very l o w standards o f state service de l ivery . At the 
same time, the state’s fa i lu re to prov ide an adequate lega l and regulatory environment prevents the 
pr iva te sector f r om fulfilling i t s po ten t ia l t o p lay a ro le in the p rov is ion o f accessible, h igh-qua l i ty 
social and economic services. The CAS w i l l tackle the fundamental governance issues 
underpinning l o w coverage and qua l i ty o f basic services b y : (i) he lp ing to establish the basic 
ins t i tu t ions and po l ic ies needed f o r transparent and e f fec t ive management o f pub l ic finances and 
pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships; and (ii) supporting the emergence o f accoun tab i l i ty f o r p lann ing and 
resource management at the loca l leve l . 

83. 
In approaching the f o l l ow i n g fou r governance objectives, i t i s impor tan t t o differentiate 
between those tw o objectives-namely, 
pr iva te sector development and pub l ic f inanc ia l 
management-in w h i c h there are reasonably well-developed sector strategies and programs in 
place, and wh ich are ready to move i n t o the implementation phase; and the rema in ing tw o 
objectives-natural 
resource management and loca l governance and accountability frameworks- 
in wh ich strategies and programs are at much earlier stages o f development. In the case o f the 
latter, much o f the ac t iv i t ies under the Bank CAS w i l l be oriented towards f irs t establishing a 
consensus and basic framework f o r the strategy and programs. The results ma t r ix in Attachment 2 
makes clear that during this C A S period, more rap id progress towards development outcomes i s 
expected in respect to PSD and P F M than i s expected in respect to NRM and social accountability. 

- 25 - 

CAS Objective 1: Promote Private Sector Development for Poverty Reduction 

84. 
The f i rs t CAS objective i s to support the Govemment ’s strategy to reduce poverty through 
export-led growth of 6-7 percent pe r annum - a comm i tmen t that has been l a i d out in successive 
p o l i c y statements, inc lud ing the NPRS and the RS. Cambodia i s takmg impor tan t steps towards 
this goal, notably b y j o i n i n g the WTO. However , t o convert market access opportunities i n t o 
employment at levels and wages that reduce pover ty requires substantial improvement in the 
domestic investment climate. T o date, a weak investment c l ima te has resulted in very narrow 
growth, high levels o f in forma l i ty , and a drop in FDI. M a l u n g gains w i l l require: (i) remov ing 
governance-related constraints (particularly corruption) that limit f i rms ’ produc t iv i ty ; (ii) bu i ld ing 
ins t i tu t ions t o enable export diversification; and (iii) strengthening the pr iva te sector ro le in pub l ic 
service de l ivery by imp rov ing transparency and compe t i t ion (Table 3). 

Tab le 3: Address the Governance Imped iments to P r iva te Sector Development 

85 . 

These reforms have become par t icu lar ly urgent in the pos t -MFA wor ld , in w h i c h the loss 
o f garment quotas cou ld result in a collapse in Cambodia’s g row th rate. The W o r l d Bank Group 
w i l l he lp the Government to establish a p o l i c y and regu la tory environment w h i c h w i l l sustain and 
build o n Cambodia’s current comparative advantage in corporate social responsibility. This w i l l 
i n v o l v e b o t h (i) ma in ta in ing Cambodia’s pos i t ion in what i s in effect a niche market f o r garments 
produced in compliance w i t h core labor standards;18 and (ii) increasing the competitiveness o f 
Cambodian products in international markets b y reduc ing the costs o f do ing business in Cambodia. 
These reforms w i l l be supported b y a series o f Poverty Reduc t ion Support Credits (PRSCs) 
proposed f o r FYO6-FYO8 (see Section V.D and B o x 8). 

18 

The Government has ra t i f ied a l l o f the core labor conventions except No. 182 on the Wors t Forms o f Ch i ld Labor, 
wh ich i t does not p lan to ra t i fy until i t i s able to implement the convention on Minimum Age. The Government i s 
seeking L O assistance in implementing the conventions. A l though labor market regulations provide l im i ted 
protection to a small segment o f the workforce, progress has been made in the enforcement o f labor standards, 
par t icu lar ly in the garment sector. 

- 26 - 

86. 

Improvements i n govemance, therefore, must be a t the heart of Cambodia’s PSD strategy. 
The Government appears comm i t ted t o this path. S im i la r commitments in the past, however, have 
no t been realized and stakeholders must now focus on results to re ta in c red ib i l i ty . The Bank w i l l 
he lp b y using the full range o f pr iva te sector ins t i tu t ions w i t h i n the B a n k Group (including, f o r 
example, 
IDA, IFC , and MPDF) , and b y he lp ing align donors and the pr iva te sector, wo rk ing 
w i t h i n the PSD TWG ( fo r wh ich the Bank Group and ADB serve as the lead donor facilitators). A 
detailed description of the W o r l d Bank Group’s strategy f o r pr iva te sector development in 
Cambodia i s prov ided in Attachment 8. 

81 . 
The Bank Group w i l l help the Govemment convert WTO and AFTA opportunities into 
p r iva te sector growth. T o do so i t w i l l support a grant-based operation (the Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and 
Competitiveness Project) w h i c h aims to reduce the t ime and cost o f administering exports and 
imports, de l iver ing b o t h a strategy to extend Cambodia’s gains in corporate social respons ib i l i ty in 
a free-trade environment, and tools to better manage Cambodia’s du ty exemptions granted to 
fore ign investors. 

88. 

Diversifying the sources of grow th is perhaps the most d i f f icu l t challenge. A t trac t ing new 
investment and building ins t i tu t ions that integrate rural, in fo rma l and new sectors i n t o Cambodia’s 
export-oriented economy w i l l require substantial progress in lega l and j u d i c i a l re fo rm . This in turn 
w i l l requ ire b u i l d i n g pr iva te sector awareness and voice. The Bank Group w i l l : (i) he lp the CDC 
create a viable Investment Promo t ion Agency; (ii) w o r k o n trade-supporting networks to he lp 
Cambodian producers meet the needs o f fore ign n iche markets; (iii) build the vo ice o f the pr iva te 
sector by strengthening business associations and building supply chain linkages; and ( iv) assist in 
d ivers i f ica t ion through I F C investments. 

89. 
Acute needs fo r better infrastructure and pub l ic services can be met most eficiently 
through a pub l ic-pr iva te response based on transparent, competitive, well-designed partnerships. 
Serious governance problems have prevented Cambodia f r om f u l l y bene f i t ing f r om P P I t o date. 
The Bank Group w i l l support imp lemen ta t ion o f a new p o l i c y toward PP I and supporting lega l and 
regu la tory changes. 
90. 
Improvements in govemance require ca re f i l and open monitoring if they are to succeed. 
The B a n k Group w i l l he lp through a second Investment C l ima te Survey (assessing changes in the 
perceptions o f the pr iva te sector) and continued I F C support to the Pr iva te Sector F o r um (wh ich 
supports dialogue between the pr iva te sector and the Government). The MPDF w i l l he lp develop 
codes o f ethics in the pr iva te sector and attempt to catalyze a broad discussion o f pr iva te sector 
governance. 

91. 
Wh i le the Bank is not actively engaged o r intending to become actively engaged in 
f inanc ia l sector reform-where 
the leading donors are the ADB and IMF- i t 
is mon i tor ing 
progress towards strengthening anti-money laundering ( AM L ) systems w i th in Cambodia. The 
Government has g iven h i g h p r i o r i t y to the dra f t ing o f the AML L aw , w i t h technical assistance 
f r o m the IMF. The dra f t law , based o n the UN M o d e l Leg is la t ion f o r c i v i l l aw jur isd ic t ions and 
the eight Special Recommendations against the f inanc ing o f terrorism, i s curren t ly under rev is ion 
b y an in ter-m in is ter ia l wo rk ing group. The draft, w h i c h i s l i k e l y to be submitted t o the Na t iona l 
Assembly during 2005, addresses An t i -Money Launde r indComba t ing F inanc ia l Te r ro r ism 
(AMLKFT) preventive obligations related to customer due diligence, record-keeping, in terna l 
controls, repor t ing o f suspicious transactions, and the setting up o f an independent f inanc ia l 
in te l l igence unit. Even i f Cambodia i s on the r i g h t track, however, precaution i s recommended 
since the imp lemen ta t ion o f the law , i f approved, can be complex. Furthermore, the Government 
has no t yet ra t i f ied the UN V ienna Conven t ion 1988 o n t h i s matter, nor has i t ye t established a 
F inanc ia l Intelligence Unit. 

92. 
The Wor ld Bank Group w i l l integrate programs f r om different agencies w i th in the Bank 
G roup to address pr iva te sector issues. The activities o f the various agencies o f the B a n k Group 

- 27 - 

have as far as possible been coordinated and mainstreamed in the design o f this CAS so as to 
max im ize in terna l complementarities and m in im ize gaps in the overa l l program. Thus I F C 
remains f u l l y engaged to build on the momentum i t s program has developed to support Cambodia’s 
g row ing pr iva te sector through a m i x o f investments and advisory activities. T h i s w i l l invo lve : (i) 
con t inu ing to wo rk to improve the investment climate through the Pr iva te Sector Forum; and (ii) 
con t inu ing t o support the c r i t ica l wo rk o f MPDF-an 
IFC- in i t ia ted , managed and funded PSD 
fac i l i ty- in building the capacity o f Cambodian entrepreneurs and SMEs. F ina l ly , I F C i s expected 
t o continue making investments in a range o f sectors-including 
in the f inanc ia l sector, general 
manufacturing, tourism, infrastructure and other sectors-to 
demonstrate that there are viable 
business opportunities i n the country.

MPDF , a mu l t i-donor funded in i t ia t ive o f the IFC , specializes in promo t ing the 
development o f SMEs. MPDF has been supporting the S M E sector in Cambodia, L a o PDR and 
V ie tnam since 1997 through a broad range o f programs. These programs w o r k synergistically at 
three levels. At the m i c r o level, the fac i l i ty helps companies in key sub-sectors t o improve their 
operations and access financing. At the meso level, the f a c i l i t y helps small and med ium 
entrepreneurs by imp rov ing the capacity o f those who prov ide services to them - banks, 
m icro f inance institutions, business consultants, business associations and management trainers. At 
the macro level, MPDF collaborates w i t h government, the pr iva te sector, donors and c i v i l society 
to imp rove the business climate. MPDF’s donors are the ADB, Australia, Canada, Finland, IFC , 
Japan, the Netherlands, N ew Zealand, Norway , Sweden, Sw i tzer land and the United K ingdom . 

CAS Objective 2: Improve Natural Resource Management 

94. 

Improved economic growth, par t icu lar ly broad-based ru ra l growth, w i l l depend c r i t ica l ly 
on increased ag r icu l tu ra l produc t ion through, inter a l ia , enhanced management of natural 

resources. Over the past decade, Cambodia has achieved overa l l f o o d se l f-su f f ic iency , However, 
several areas o f Cambodia rema in f o o d insecure, and agr icu l tura l g row th has been substantially 
h igher in ne ighbor ing countries. The Government has ind ica ted that agr icu l tura l g row th rates o f 5 - 
6 percent per annum w i l l be requ ired to support i t s overa l l economic g row th and pover ty reduction 
objectives through an increasing shift f r om subsistence to market-oriented agriculture. The RS 
focuses o n improvements in agr icu l tura l produc t iv i ty and d ivers i f ica t ion through improvements in 
the overa l l investment c l ima te f o r agribusiness (see Ob jec t ive 1 ) ; mo re equitable access to, and 
management o f na tura l resources, inc lud ing land; and increased use o f imp roved agricultural 
inputs and technology. 

95 . 

I n this context, the second CAS objective is to support improvements i n the management of 
Cambodia’s abundant na tura l resources to better contribute to sustainable ru ra l growth and 

poverty reduction. W o r k i n g w i t h our partners in Government, c i v i l society and other donors, the 
W o r l d Bank w i l l he lp reorient p o l i c y and practice towards greater sharing o f the responsibilities 
and benefits associated w i t h NRM w i t h loca l stakeholders. The Bank ’s program w i l l focus o n 
im p r o v i n g the security o f access o f the poor to land and forests, resources wh ich are cruc ia l to 
ru ra l livelihoods, through mechanisms wh ich increase transparency and par t ic ipa t ion in NRM 
(Table 4). Th is w i l l complement ADB’s focus o n investment support to i r r iga t ion and UK DFID’s 
focus on fisheries and general ru ra l livelihoods, and w i l l fac i l i ta te closer co l labora t ion w i t h F A 0 
in supporting ru ra l strategy and p o l i c y development. 

96. 

The Bank w i l l actively support the agr icu l tura l TWGs as the basis fo r developing sector 
programs and identifying ma jor po l icy issues fo r Govemment-donor dialogue. The Bank’s 

analytical and f inanc ia l support f o r land, forestry and b iod ivers i ty management w i l l be developed 
w i t h the TWGs f o r L a n d (Germany and W o r l d Bank as lead donor facilitators) and Forestry and 
Env ironmen t (Denmark as lead donor fac i l i ta tor) . The Bank w i l l also be an active participant in 
the TWG f o r agr icu l ture and i r r iga t ion (Aus tra l ia and France as lead donor facilitators). 
expected that some NRM issues iden t i f ied b y the TWGs w i l l f o rm par t o f the Government’s po l icy 
agenda to be supported through the PRSCs (Section D be low) . The W o r l d Bank w i l l also 

I t i s

emphasize partnerships w i t h c i v i l society groups wo rk ing in NRM so as to bo th benefit f r om their 
f i e l d experience as w e l l as strengthen their capacity to support rural communities. 

Tab le 4: Imp rove Accountability and Transparency in NRM 

97. 
The Bank w i l l j o i n the wo rk of other donors in assisting the Govemment to strengthen the 
overa l l framework fo r management of land resources. The basic requirements fo r e f fec t ive land 
use management are s t i l l under development in Cambodia. Up to 80 percent o f Cambodia’s l a n d 
area i s technically under state management, however there are n o current land use, land capab i l i ty 
o r l a n d c lass i f ica t ion maps available to guide land use and allocation decisions. W o r k i n g in 
con junc t ion w i t h Canada, Finland, Germany and Australia, the B a n k w i l l support development o f 
b o t h the in fo rma t ion base, as w e l l as the decentralization and deconcentration o f land use p lann ing 
and allocation to communes, districts and provinces through support under the ex is t ing and second 
phase o f the L a n d Management and Adm in is tra t ion Project (LMAP) as w e l l as the planned L a n d 
A l loca t ion f o r Social and Economic Development Pro jec t (LASED ) . 

98. 
Ensuring security of 
tenure is important to protect livelihoods of 
the poor and to 
encourage investment in productivity improvements and d ive rs i jca t ion . LMAP, co-financed w i t h 
Canada, ’ Germany and Finland, w i l l continue t o support land registration in l i n e w i t h the 
Government’s goal to complete this process f o r the entire coun try b y 2015. A series o f studies 
under LMAP w i l l iden t i fy constraints to the operation o f l a n d markets, inc lud ing issues o f taxa t ion 
and urban and peri-urban planning. LMAP 11, starting in 2008, w i l l further strengthen pr iva te 
proper ty rights (par t icu lar ly among vulnerable groups) and imp rove land use planning. In order to 
re in force the ab i l i ty o f the poor to defend their property rights, the Bank w i l l continue to support 
administrative dispute 
reso lu t ion 
through Cadastral Commissions under LMAP, w h i l e 
imp lemen t ing a Justice fo r the Poor study to better understand h ow the rights o f the poor can be 
better represented in the j u d i c i a l system. 

99. 
The Bank w i l l support development of 
land a l loca t ion mechanisms wh ich promote 
smallholder based ag r icu l tu ra l grow th . Abou t 12 to 15 percent o f Cambodians are estimated t o be 
landless and a larger propor t ion has insu f f ic ien t land ho ld ings to support their households. At the 

- 29 - 

same time, the Government i s faced w i t h decisions regarding the a l loca t ion o f the large areas of 
state lands consistent w i t h pover ty reduction, economic g row th and environmental sustainability 
objectives. There i s l i t t l e in fo rma t ion on the trade-offs between various pr ior i t ies o f land use, so 
several studies w i l l be carried out w i t h the L a n d TWG in 2005 to assess the r o l e o f land allocation 
to smallholders in the context o f an increasingly trade-oriented r u r a l economy. Building on the 
results o f these studies, L A S ED , starting in 2006, w i l l assist the Government to develop 
transparent, community-based mechanisms t o implement i t s po l icy f o r allocation o f land to the 
poor through Social Concessions. 

100. Management of Cambodia’s considerable forest areas fo r 
the benefit of 
local 
communities, state revenues, and biodiversity conservation represent a ma jor challenge. Forest 
management i s a par t icu lar ly contentious issue in Cambodia and there i s general recogn i t ion o f the 
need to build o n the recent Independent Forest Sector Rev iew to develop a common, strategic 
agenda to ensure b o t h sustainability and broader sharing o f benefits in forest management. The 
Bank w i l l support the Forestry TWG in carrying out studies and proposals t o build consensus 
around a program to improve governance o f forestry resources. A Poverty and Env ironmen ta l 
Nexus Study w i l l prov ide more in fo rma t ion o n the relationship o f loca l communities to common 
property resources, such as non- t imber forest products and fish. Based o n the resource p lann ing 
and transparency elements in troduced under the Forest Concession Management Project, the Bank 
w i l l focus i t s support on broader stakeholder engagement in a l l aspects o f forestry management, 
inc lud ing mon i to r ing and enforcement activities. The entry po in t fo r add i t iona l Bank support w i l l 
b e through grant fund ing f r om JSDF and other sources to d irec t ly support the Government and 
NGOs to develop approaches w h i c h strengthen the ro le o f communities in management o f forest 
resources. Add i t iona l areas o f support w i l l depend on progress in de f in ing w i t h the Government a 
common, strategic agenda wh ich attracts support f r om a number o f donor and, po ten t ia l ly , N G O 
partners. 

’ 

101. 
The Bank w i l l also support the Govemment’s capacity to wo rk w i t h other partners to 
strengthen biodiversity protection. Cambodia has benefited f r om substantial assistance f r om 
international conservation NGOs; however, i t s extensive protected areas and protected forests s t i l l 
represent a ma jor management challenge. The ongoing B iod ive rs i ty and Protected Areas 
Management Learn ing and Innova t ion Project i s building the Government’s capacity to develop a 
Na t iona l Protected Areas System through an i n i t i a l focus on management p lann ing and 
demarcation in V irachey Na t iona l Park. Fu ture assistance w i l l he lp the Government to build o n 
this experience, and that o f i t s in terna t iona l partners, to develop a more sustainable basis f o r 
b iod ivers i ty conservation. A detailed description o f the W o r l d Bank’s strategy f o r environmental 
sustainability in Cambodia i s prov ided in Attachment 5 . 

CAS Objective 3: Improve Public F inanc ia l Management for Pro-poor Service Delivery 

102. 

The th i rd CAS objective is to support core elements of the Govemment’s reform agenda by 
strengthening the pub l ic sec tor ’s f inanc ia l management capacity, wh ich is a c r i t ica l foundation fo r 
better pro-poor service delivery and reducing corrup t ion . The Bank, j o i n t l y w i t h other 
development partners, w i l l support reforms that a im to reconstruct the ins t i tu t iona l underpinnings 
necessary fo r a more e f fec t ive and accountable pub l ic administration. These e f for ts w i l l focus o n 
strengthening PFM , m o v i n g towa rd the establishment o f a meritocratic c i v i l service, and 
increasing accountability to Cambodian citizens (Table 5). The Bank w i l l also support increased 
transparency and accountability in P F M b y j o i n i n g w i t h other development partners in building the 
capacity o f the Government’s na t iona l audit authority. 

103. 
The Bank w i l l continue to support strong partnerships in P F M through the SWAP 
established in 2004. Ten development partners have worked closely w i t h the M i n i s t r y o f 
Economy and Finance to develop a r e f o rm program and have agreed to w o r k j o i n t l y in a SWAP to 
coordinate their support f o r the program. Partners w i l l j o i n t l y mon i to r performance against an 

- 30 - 

agreed framework through the P F M T W G (co-facilitated by IMF and ADB). The Bank w i l l also 
manage a mu l t i-par tner P F M Trust Fund financed b y Australia, the UK, EU and Sweden. 

Table 5: Improve Public Financial Management 

104. 
T h e Bank ’s support to the Govemment on P F M reform w i l l focus on building a credible 
budget and improving in tema l control and f iduc iary accountability. The cornerstone o f the 
program i s the Government’s P F M Re fo rm Program (PFMRP), launched by the Pr ime M in is te r in 
December 2004. This presents a detailed, p r io r i t ized and sequenced ac t ion plan, incorporating the 
recommendations o f the j o i n t AD B -W o r l d Bank Zntegrated F iduc iary Assessment and Pub l ic 
Expenditure Review 2003 (IFAPER). Stage 1 o f the PFMRP attempts to make the budget a 
credible instrument f o r the strategic and operational management o f pub l ic resources b y ensuring 
that i t delivers resources pred ic tab ly and re l iab ly to line ministry managers. Stage 2 aims to 
improve in terna l con tro l (ho ld ing resource managers accountable). Stage 3, b u i l d i n g on better 
budget management, wou ld strengthen the linkages that make the budget a re l iab le instrument o f 
pro-poor p o l i c y implementation. I t i s expected that Stages 1 and 2 (and part o f Stage 3) w o u l d 
correspond to this CAS period. 

105. 
The Bank w i l l use a combination of instruments to assist the Govemment to implement its 
PFMRP . Three Pover ty Reduc t ion Support Credits (PRSCs) over FYO6-08 w i l l be deployed to 
support, inter a l ia , high l e v e l P F M po l icy reforms, corresponding w i t h the f irs t three stages o f the 
PFMRP. The B a n k w i l l also support Stages 1-3 v i a a Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management and 
Accoun tab i l i ty Pro jec t (PFMAP) . A grant f r om a mu l t i-donor Trust Fund w i l l assist strengthening 
o f the capacity o f the Na t iona l Assembly and Senate to exercise oversight o f pub l ic finances. 
Further ana ly t ica l and advisory services-in 
the f o rm o f hea l th and education PETS and a f o l l ow - 
up IFAPER -w i l l support the r e f o rm program. 

106. 
The Bank w i l l support c iv i l service reform w i th a focus on introducing the pr inc ip les and 
practices of a mer i tocra t ic c iv i l service, using a two-pronged approach. At the m in is t ry level, the 
Bank w o u l d support ra t iona l iz ing curren t ly ad hoc and non-transparent salary supplementation 
practices and imp lemen ta t ion o f merit-based pay and employment p i lo ts that have the po ten t ia l to 
serve as models f o r w ider c i v i l service reforms. This w i l l b e in troduced selectively in key 
m i n i s t r i e s starting w i t h p i lo ts in the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, and tw o o r three other ministries and w i l l 
be gradually phased in the other ministries over time. In parallel, at the who le o f Govemment 
level, the Bank i s also helping to develop a strategic c i v i l service pay and employment r e f o rm 
p o l i c y that w o u l d pay more to p r i o r i t y staff, redeploy c i v i l servants to high p r i o r i t y activities, limit 

- 3 1 - 

the overa l l size o f the c i v i l service, and strengthen c i v i l service management by im p r o v i n g 
establishment con tro l and en forc ing merit-based recruitment and promotion. 

107. 
I n c iv i l service reform, the Bank w i l l focus on ana ly t ica l and advisory services un t i l the 
reform p lan is in place. W o r k i n g j o i n t l y w i t h other development partners, the Bank w i l l prov ide 
coordinated technical assistance f o r c i v i l service reform, especially o n the issues that intersect 
PFM and c i v i l service reform. Ana ly t ica l and advisory services w i l l focus o n service de l ivery 
surveys (c i t izen scorecards f o r key sectors), im p r o v i n g transparency and strengthening the vo ice o f 
citizens. 

CAS Objective 4: Support Decentralization and Promote Citizens’ Partnerships for Better 
Governance 

108. 
The Constitution provides fo r a partnership w i th citizens to strengthen accountability. 
Cambodia’s framework o f accountability, der ived f r om the Constitution, i s based o n three key 
relationships o f accountability: (i) between elected o f f ic ia ls and those responsible f o r de l iver ing 
essential services to citizens; (ii) between citizens and the state; and (iii) between those who 
de l iver services and the citizens who receive these services. The w o r k under this objective i s 
concerned w i t h a l l three o f these relationships (Table 6). The primary investment vehicle w i l l be 
projects at the commune level-the 
lowes t leve l at wh ich citizens interact w i t h the state, elected 
representatives, and service providers. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also invest through a pro jec t to 
imp rove social jus t ice and access to in forma t ion . Ana ly t ica l wo rk and partnerships w i l l support 
the evo lv ing v is ion fo r deconcentration and decentralization and w i l l contribute to establishing an 
enabling environment f o r c i v i c engagement. The W o r l d Bank w i l l w o r k w i t h other donors to 
agree o n a p la t fo rm approach to supporting accountability through p i l o t i n g tools f o r in formed , 
constructive, and peaceful engagement in the three relationships o f accountability. 

Table 6: Support Decentralization and Promote Citizens’ Partnerships for Better Governance 

- 32 - 

109. A conducive po l icy and 
legal framework 
is essential fo r c lar i fy ing 
the fu tu re 
deconcentration and decentralization strategy and the enabling environment for citizens’ 
partnerships. The Government’s evo lv ing deconcentration and decentralization strategy and 
corresponding lega l frameworks w i l l need to c la r i fy fu ture roles and responsibilities o f the state, 
service providers, and elected stakeholders at a l l levels down to the village, and the steps needed to 
translate the v is ion to rea l i ty . Coordination o f the donor support f o r this process i s through the 
Deconcentration and Decentralization TWG in wh ich the Bank w i l l participate ac t ive ly and 
contribute analytical work . The Bank’s w o r k w i t h c i v i l society and on social accountability w i l l 
also evolve along w i t h the agenda. Ana ly t ica l work on the enabling environment f o r c iv ic 
engagement w i l l iden t i fy the constraints, pr ior i t ies and c r i t ica l elements needed to foster 
constructive, free, and peaceful engagement. The Bank w i l l w o r k w i t h the wider donor 
commun i ty to encourage sw i f t passage o f a Freedom o f In fo rma t ion A c t and An t i -Co r rup t ion L aw . 
In the dra f t ing in FY05 o f a new N G O law , the Bank w i l l encourage an intensive consultative 
process and w i l l o f fe r technical assistance and advice to b o t h the Government and N G O 
commun i ty to ensure that such a law, i f passed, fo l lows g loba l best practice in p rov id ing an 
enabling environment f o r c i t izen participation. 

110. 

The Bank’s p r ima ry investment support to decentralization is through the ongoing Rural 
Investment and Local Governance Pro jec t (R ILGP , FY03-FY06), and a fu tu re planned R ILGP II. 
R I LG P supports improved l o c a l govemance as a foundation f o r sustainable development and 
poverty reduc t ion by strengthening the new ly decentralized development process at the commune 
leve l and p rov id ing grants f o r p r io r i ty ru ra l infrastructure and related pub l ic goods iden t i f ied 
through this loca l p lann ing process. M o r e specifically, R I LG P aims t o support imp roved loca l 
governance through: (i) enhancing the inclusiveness, transparency and accoun tab i l i ty o f the new ly 
decentralized loca l government ins t i tu t iona l structures and processes at the commune and province 
levels; and (ii) strategic p o l i c y studies t o i n f o rm the ongoing dialogue o n deconcentration reforms. 
A fo l low -on project ( R L G P I1 FY07) w i l l be the Bank’s ma in lend ing support to the new 
decentralized mechanisms once they are clarified. This project w i l l build on lessons being learned 
f r om other decentralized projects in Cambodia and elsewhere o n h ow t o strengthen the vo ice o f 
communities through building and supporting community-based organizations so that they can 
influence even more h ow the funds are used to better address their needs and pr ior i t ies . 

11 1. 

The rights of ord inary citizens must be better protected, and conjidence needs to be bu i l t 
i n the justice and dispute resolution systems, so that people are able to par t ic ipa te in partnerships 
fo r accountability. The Justice f o r the Poor Project (FY07) w i l l increase the access o f poor people 
and communities to justice. This w i l l explore opportunities bo th t o increase citizens’ access to the 
fo rma l j u d i c i a l system-through 
lega l rights awareness, increased access to in forma t ion , and other 
approaches-and w i l l enhance the capacity f o r in fo rma l o r alternative dispute resolution. The 
project design w i l l draw o n the analytical w o r k already in i t ia ted (FYO5-06), and coord ina t ion w i t h 
the Government and other donors through the Lega l and Jud ic ia l R e f o rm TWG. 

112. 

The Bank w i l l help enhance the eflectiveness of accountability processes a t na t iona l and 
sub-national levels by involving citizens more strategically. Technical advice and resources to 
design and p i l o t tools t o he lp citizens and c i v i l society organizations contribute cons truc t ive ly and 
e f fec t ive ly to im p r o v i n g accountability w i l l be integrated in to , or alongside, Bank- funded projects. 
The new education project, f o r example, includes p i lo t ing and expanding commun i ty scorecards to 
measure qua l i ty o f service de l ivery at the commune level. A lso , the w o r k o n PFM w i l l inc lude 
activities to he lp na t iona l- leve l elected representatives understand and in terpre t pub l ic budgets. A 
proposed operational p l a t f o rm supported by DFID and other donors w i l l prov ide assistance to the 
Government or donor s ta f f designing projects, and to c i v i l society groups who w i s h t o p i l o t new 
tools, scale up successes, and t o disseminate lessons o f good practice i n c l u d i n g g loba l experience. 
I t may also, w i t h DFID funding, open a Centre wh ich w o u l d act as the operational hub f o r C i t izen 
Partnership in Better Governance ac t iv i t ies and be a resource center fo r c i v i l society. 

- 33 - 

113. Access to information is a prerequisite fo r func t ion ing accountability mechanisms and fo r 
enabling citizens to exact accountability. The Bank w i l l promo te access to in fo rma t ion in four 
ways: (i) through analytical wo rk o n grass roots media, channels o f communication, and 
constraints o n access to accurate and balanced in fo rma t ion through the proposed Justice fo r the 
Poor and Commun i ty Empowerment grant; (ii) the Bank i s exp lo r ing the opportunities f o r a grant- 
funded p i l o t project to support the development o f l o c a l o r commun i ty radios; (iii) the lega l and 
po l icy aspects o f access to in forma t ion w i l l be explored, analyzing laws on, f o r example, freedom 
o f in forma t ion , broadcasting, N G O laws, and the interface between citizens and the state in the 
decentralization and deconcentration strategy; and ( iv ) b y rev iew ing h ow the proposed j o i n t 
resource centers mentioned above cou ld be used to promote better access to in forma t ion . 

P i l la r 2: Supporting the Strategy and Investments Needed to A t ta in the CMDGs 

114. 
The Government intends to use the NSDP (2006-2010) to imp lemen t the v is ion l a i d out in 
the RS and to attain Cambodia’s MDGs. As discussed earlier, wh i le Cambodia has made some 
progress towards achieving some o f the CMDGs , a t ta in ing a number o f the targets w i l l be d i f f icu l t 
and w i l l need a more concerted e f fo r t b y a l l . Cambodia i s l i k e l y to meet the target f o r universal 
pr imary school enrolment; however, meeting the targets f o r secondary education ( inc lud ing female 
secondary school enrolment) seems un l ike ly . W h i l e some progress has been made toward 
achieving health-related goals, at current rates, the increases are no t su f f ic ien t to meet the CMDGs . 
The C M D G target o f reduc ing HIV prevalence rates b y 2015 should be achieved although HIV 
transmission patterns are shifting, w i t h most new in fec t ions occurr ing among marr ied women and 
their children. Furthermore, increasing you th risk behavior, and i l l i c i t drug use among you th cou ld 
act as a new po ten t ia l dr iver o f H N transmission. 

115. M e e t i n g the C M D G target o f ha lv ing the popu la t ion in pover ty b y 2015 w i l l require 
considerably faster economic grow th and a more pro-poor orientation to that growth. In add i t ion 
to the governance reforms needed to create an enabling environment o f shared g row th and pover ty 
reduction, Cambodia w i l l also need to continue to make massive investments in infrastructure 
prov is ion and management to improve access and reduce costs since i t lags beh ind most other 
countries in the Reg ion in the quantity and qua l i ty o f infrastructure services (Figure 3). W i thou t 
this, i t w i l l be d i f f i c u l t f o r Cambodia to f u l l y integrate w i t h reg iona l and g loba l markets and to 
reduce the costs o f do ing business and increase i t s competitiveness.

CAS Objective 5: Support the Formu lat ion and Implementation of a Government-led Strategy 
and investment Program for Achieving the CMDG s 

116. 
The Bank w i l l support the s h i j i towards govemment ownership of the development agenda 
by fac i l i ta t ing the prepara t ion and implementation of 
the next f ive-year national strategy fo r 
grow th and poverty reduction. Cambodia has found i t hard to iden t i fy and assert i t s ow n 
development strategy. This i s in part due to decades o f war and authoritarianism wh ich have l e f t 
Cambodia w i t h weak forma l ins t i tu t ions o f the state and a loose ly structured c i v i l society. 
However, i t i s due also in part to high levels o f a id dependence and donor approaches wh ich have 
limited and at times undermined the development o f core government capacities f o r setting and 
imp lemen t ing strategy in the face o f numerous, sometimes incompa t ib le donor-led interventions. 
The Bank w i l l seek to foster deeper and broader government ownership o f the NSDP, and w i l l 
support greater inc lus ion o f c i v i l society perspectives in these processes (Table 7). 

Tab le 7: Support the Fo rmu la t ion and Imp lementat ion of a Government- led Strategy and 
Investment P rog r am fo r A t ta in ing the CMDGs 

117. 
The Government and donors have agreed that f r om 2005 there w i l l be just one, pover ty- 
focused, five-year NSDP (2006-2010) w h i c h w i l l replace SEDP I1 and NPRS and operationalize 
the Government’s RS, using the CMDG s t o frame de f in i t ion o f a med ium- term M&E framework. 
Spec i f ica l ly , the Bank w i l l : 

Support the preparation and subsequent imp lemen ta t ion o f the new NSDP in ways that 
promote greater government ownership, and that contribute to more systematic and sustainable 
capacity development. W o r k i n g in partnership w i t h others through a new TWG, B a n k support

p o l i c y issues . As part o f this effort, the Bank w i l l w o r k w i t h others to mainstream gender 
considerations in the planning, implementation and mon i to r ing o f national development 
strategies, wo rk ing through the Gender T W G and us ing an IDF grant to support studies, 
budget analysis and mon i to r ing (Attachment 7) . 

Build greater technical capacity in Cambodia to collect, analyze and use data on poverty and 
socio-economic development. Fac i l i ta t ing the development o f partnerships around key pieces 
o f AAA work , the B a n k w i l l seek t o foster a shared understanding o f poverty, enabling a l l 
stakeholders to engage f u l l y in debates concerning government strategy. 
In 2005, the Bank 
w i l l carry out a na t iona l Poverty Assessment that w i l l build l i n k s between donor research, 
government and independent research institutes, and c i v i l society, and wh ich w i l l draw 
together and synthesize a variety o f quantitative and qua l i ta t ive insights i n t o poverty. (These 
inc lude the CSES 2004; mixed-methods research i n t o household pover ty dynamics - the 
M o v i n g out o f Pover ty Study, and the Participatory Pover ty Assessment around the Ton le 
Sap). 

W o r k i n g w i t h UNDP in particular, the W o r l d Bank w i l l he lp coordinate donor support to 
b u i l d i n g the technical and ins t i tu t iona l strengths o f na t iona l actors in conducting pover ty- 
related M&E and analysis. An IDF grant w i l l be used to build up the technical and managerial 
strengths o f the Na t iona l Ins t i tu te o f Statistics (N IS) , he lp ing i t to develop a regular schedule 
o f core data co l lec t ion exercises (such as a CSES every 3-5 years), backed b y predictable

C A S Objective 6: Support w i th Ana ly t ica l and Investment Services those Under-funded Sectors 
and Sub-sectors C r i t i c a l to Ach iev ing the CMDGs 

118. 
The Bank w i l l help to f inance the achievement of the Cambodian MDGs w i t h investments 
in human development and infrastructure, p rov id ing a partnership r o l e b y supplying analytical 
inputs and investment in support o f those aspects o f the NSDP wh ich are curren t ly under-funded 
o r where progress i s regarded as par t icu lar ly important. In some cases, this invo lves supporting 
sectors w h i c h prov ide a v i ta l ro le in enabling the achievement o f development outcomes (the 
CMDGs), and wh ich are at present under-funded re la t ive to other sectors. In other cases, Bank 
contributions to well-established r e f o rm programs a im to sharpen the pro-poor focus o f service 
de l ivery . Support to human development and infrastructure p rov is ion w i l l be channeled b o t h 
through projects that were prepared in the c los ing years o f the previous C A S that w i l l prov ide 
results over the new C A S pe r iod (wh ich amount to some US$120 m i l l ion ) , and through new 
lending (Table 8).

119. 

The Bank’s p rog ram i n health and education w i l l focus on the tw in goals of increasing 
equity in access to services, and improving quality and eficiency of services to the poor . This w i l l 
be achieved through support f o r sector-wide programs consistent w i t h government pr ior i t ies and in 

- 36 - 

coord ina t ion w i t h other donors as w e l l as through strengthened pub l ic administration and 
financial/expenditure management and targeted support f o r interventions that address constraints 
to access f o r the very poor. 

120. 
In education, the Bank w i l l support the M i n i s t r y o f Education, You th and Sport’s 
Educa t ion Sector Support Program (ESSP) to expand access, w i t h special focus on the poor and 
underserved communities. The Bank w i l l strive t o (i) address supply- and demand-side barriers to 
education; and (ii) promote more efficient, decentralized mechanisms t o nurture improvements in 
educational qua l i ty . 
In higher education, the Bank w i l l a im to strengthen the ins t i tu t iona l 
framework t o achieve improvements in qua l i ty assurance and accountability i f the necessary sector 
governance reforms are undertaken as expected. The m a i n instrument w i l l be the Education Sector 
Support Project (appraised j o i n t l y w i t h the ADB’ s education program to ensure alignment and 
complementarity). The Bank i s undertaking an ambitious technical and advisory services agenda, 
including a PETS, a rev iew o f educational quality constraints, an analysis o f pr iva te costs to basic 
education, an impact evaluation o f scholarships as a mechanism to lowe r demand-side barriers to 
schoo l ing and a rev iew o f options f o r incen t ive structures to attract, retain, motivate and develop 
qua l i f ied teachers. As discussed above, the Bank w i l l w o r k to support the Education SWAP 
developed under the Education TWG, f o r wh ich UNESCO i s the lead donor facilitator. 

121. 
In health, Bank support to the sector w i l l continue to be articulated ma in ly through the 
Hea l th Sector Support Project (HSSP), wo rk ing in co l labora t ion w i t h a l l .other key donors through 
a sector-wide approach. In particular, the Bank w i l l support the Government’s commitment t o 
prov ide affordable hea l th services to the poor b y rev is ing the system o f exemptions and pay ing 
(through equ i ty funds) f o r services rendered to the poor in pub l ic fac i l i t ies . This i s complemented 
b y e f for ts to improve service quality, reduce the burden o f in fec t ious disease, and improve sector 
capacity and performance. In a po l icy that also supports CAS Ob jec t ive 3 ( imp rov ing service 
de l ivery through P F M reform), the w o r l d Bank w i l l continue to support the ADB-sponsored 
in troduc t ion o f performance-based contracts w i t h NGO s in the hea l th sector (an in i t ia t ive wh ich 
has imp roved pub l ic sector performance and health outcomes, par t icu lar ly w i t h regard to maternal 
and c h i l d health services). A PETS w i l l be carried out in coord ina t ion w i t h the M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th 
and other sector partners. Ana ly t ic wo rk w i l l support the fu ture development o f the health sector 
strategy, w i t h a particular focus on imp rov ing the impac t o f the hea l th sector strategy and pub l ic 
expenditure on C M D G targets f o r c h i l d and maternal mor ta l i ty . Thls analysis w i l l i n f o rm a Hea l th 
Sector Support Program I1 ( l ike ly after the CAS pe r iod in FY09) designed to he lp attain these 
goals. As discussed above, the Bank w i l l prov ide enough resources to support the development o f 
the SWAP j o i n t l y w i t h DFID and w i t h WHO , w h i c h i s the lead donor fac i l i ta tor f o r the TWG o n 
health. 

122. 
The Bank’s infrastructure program-including both ongoing and new operations -w i l l 
continue to support the economic growth agenda and the achievement of the CMDGs. The Bank’s 
investment program w i l l support government-owned strategies and w i l l b e an in tegra l part o f the 
overa l l donor e f for t , w i t h a focus o n the core infrastructure f o r agr icu l tura l g row th and access by 
the poor to basic infrastructure services. Interventions w i l l support decisive shifts towards a sector 
w ide approach (supporting the development o f sub-sector strategies and med ium- term investment 
and maintenance programs, in the framework o f the na t iona l development strategy). Three 
ongo ing lend ing operations-Provincial 
and Per i-Urban Water and Sanitation, P rov inc ia l and 
Ru ra l Infrastructure, and Ru ra l E lec tr i f ica t ion and Transmission-are 
in early stages o f 
imp lemen ta t ion and w i l l run through much o f the C A S period. A l l three focus o n addressing 
urgent p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l issues in these sectors. 

123. 
In the energy sector, the Bank w i l l support updating the national power development 
master plan; fac i l i ta te improvement o f sector governance and increased compe t i t ion f o r pr iva te 
par t ic ipa t ion in power supply; and continue assistance to ru ra l e lec tr i f ica t ion and, through GM S 
power trade in i t ia t ives , least-cost power supply (e.g., cross-border interconnections) t o ma jo r 
urban centers. W h i l e offshore o i l and gas has recently been discovered, i t i s no t k n ow n h ow large 

- 37 - 

o r economically viable the deposits w i l l turn out to be. The energy sector rev iew w i l l examine t h s 
issue and may lead to Bank AAA w o r k in support o f the development o f a transparent f isca l 
management and regulatory framework. Transpor t sector operations, framed w i t h i n the parameters 
o f a roads SWAp , w i l l contribute to government-led and ADB-suppor ted development o f a 
coherent transport strategy, med ium- term investment and maintenance programs, and sustainable 
road maintenance funding. Lend ing w i l l complement the activities o f other donors and focus o n 
secondary, tertiary and ru ra l commun i ty roads. 

124. Water and sanitation sector operations w i l l consolidate ins t i tu t iona l reforms made in 
recent years and assist the Government and mun ic ipa l authorities in p rov id ing Cambodian towns 
and g row ing peri-urban areas w i t h sustainable potable water and sanitation services, 
complementing the ADB’s Ru ra l Water Supply and Sanitation Project (2005). A l l o f these 
infrastructure-related activities w i l l be implemented through the TWG fo r Infrastructure and 
Reg iona l Integration, f o r wh ich the donor fac i l i ta tor ro le i s shared b y ADB and Japan. 
Te lecodZCT operations w i l l focus o n technical assistance to help: (i) develop a telecom regulatory 
environment, consistent w i t h Cambodia’s WTO commitments; and (ii) accelerated improvement in 
ru ra l access to telecom and in fo rma t ion services. 

125. At the regional leve l , wise management o f water resources and par t icu lar ly the M e k o n g 
watershed i s c r i t ica l f o r security and pover ty reduc t ion in Cambodia. As a downstream country, 
however, Cambodia remains vulnerable to upstream developments. The Government gives high 
p r i o r i t y to imp rov ing i t s administrative capacities f o r water resource management and i t s 
barga in ing pos i t ion in the M R C . The Bank has been he lp ing (in cooperation w i t h ADB and other 
donors) to address these concerns through p o l i c y advice and TA at bo th the coun try and reg iona l 
levels, notably through the GEF-funded TA project fo r the M R C Water U t i l i z a t i o n Program. The 
Bank w i l l continue to lead a reg iona l mu l t i-donor cooperative e f fo r t f o r sustainable water 
management and development by developing a broad-based and long- term assistance strategy 
aimed at the ind iv idua l countries and the MRC . In Cambodia, the Bank w i l l he lp to strengthen the 
country’s sector management capacity and (through the MRC ) the operational partnership o f the 
Government w i t h i t s ne ighbor ing r ipar ian countries. The Mekong R i v e r Assistance Strategy that 
the B a n k w i l l develop in partnership w i t h the Commission, ADB and the other donors, w i l l shape 
the strategic framework f o r sustainable reg iona l infrastructure investments (in hydropower, 
navigation, wetland management, bulk water supply, etc.) that can bene f i t Cambodia’s longer te rm 
interests.

PARTNERSHIPS AND AID EFFECTIVENESS 

126. 
The mutually-reinforcing connections between weak govemance and poorly-coordinated, 
donor-dr iven development cooperation have been sketched above. Seeking to break this cycle, the 
Bank w i l l build o n the momen tum f o r a i d harmonization and alignment that has developed in 
Cambodia over the last year under the leadership o f the Government o f Cambodia (Box 6) and 
consolidate recent developments in the Bank’s ow n approach. The CAS e x p l i c i t l y aims t o 
re in force change in the way the B a n k Group does business in Cambodia, by deve lop ing B a n k 
Group activities w i t h i n the framework o f evo lv ing partnerships w i t h the Government, other 
donors, and c i v i l society. 

127. 
This increasingly exp l ic i t focus on partnerships and the move f r om govemance-retarding 
to govemance-enhancing a id modalities emerged as a key theme dur ing the prepara t ion of this 
CAS, and w i l l be made a central p r inc ip le of 
the Bank Group’s work over the next four years. 
During 2004, the Cambodia coun try strategies f o r the ADB, the W o r l d Bank, DFID and UNDAF 
were prepared in unprecedented close cooperation between the fou r partners (as w e l l as regular 
consultation w i t h the Government, other donors, c i v i l society and the pr iva te sector). I t i s hoped 
that t h i s has imp roved their common understanding o f the development challenges in Cambodia 
and their ab i l i ty to adopt a coordinated p o l i c y dialogue, reduce the transaction costs faced b y the 
Government, and, by rep lac ing sometimes contradictory donor negotiations w i t h a co l lec t ive 

- 38 - 

dialogue, enable the Government to develop ownership and cohesion in i t s p o l i c y framework. The 
partnership i s no t exclusive but a nucleus around w h i c h t o build cooperation w i t h other 
development partners, b o t h on the strategic and operational levels. 

128. ADB and the Wo r ld Bank have built upon these discussions by agreeing on areas where 
one among them acts as “ lead agency” in supporting the govemment efforts to develop and 

implement sector strategies. This d iv is ion o f labor between the ADB and the W o r l d Bank, 
designed in order to max im ize the impact o f the a l loca t ion o f the ir comb ined AAA and investment 
services, has been structured according to each o f the ma jor areas o f the RS (Table 9 ) . In areas 
where one agency takes the lead role, the other w o u l d p lay a supporting ro le . 
In some cross- 
cu t t ing areas (e.g., PFM) w h i c h are c r i t ica l to the func t ion ing o f the pub l ic sector and in wh ich 
bo th agencies are already wo rk ing together in a SWAP arrangement, they w o u l d continue to do so. 
The w o r k wou ld o f course b e done through the TWGs and in partnership w i t h the Government and 
a l l other donors. At the request o f the Government and the donor community, the Bank w i l l 
continue t o act as lead donor fac i l i ta tor in support to the government-led process o f harmonization 
and alignment.

- 39 - 

129. 
The key to imp rov ing donor coordination i s an understanding o f the need f o r better 
commun ica t ion among a l l development partners-including 
the Government-and 
the importance 
o f sending clear and consistent messages on the steps fo rwa rd f o r po l icy reform. T o this end, 
ADB, the W o r l d Bank, DFID and the UN System have developed a set o f "Partnership Principles" 
that w i l l serve as a basis f o r the relationships built among themselves and w i t h the Government, 
other international development partners, the pr iva te sector, and c i v i l society (Box 7 ) . The Bank 
w i l l also seek to integrate a strategic and coherent communications element i n t o i t s work, ensuring 
that a l l stakeholders in Cambodia are in fo rmed about the B a n k s activities and the goals that 
underp in them. Such an e f fo r t can he lp to ensure that the Bank closes the accountability l o o p and 
can also p lay a po ten t ia l ly valuable ro le in building a foundation o f in fo rmed debate and broad 
support f o r reforms.

D. 

BANK GROUP PROGRAM 

130. 
The Bank’s lending program fo r Cambodia fo r FY05-08 is presented i n Table 10. 
reflects the Government’s pr ior i t ies as l a i d out in the RS and has been designed after extensive 
consultations w i t h the Government, donors, private sector and NGOs . 
In addition, detailed 
consultations were h e l d w i t h ADB, DFID and the UN System t o c l a r i f y roles and responsibilities. 
Extensive consultations have also been he ld among ADB, Japan, and the W o r l d Bank in fo rg ing 
greater synergies among the three partners at the program imp lemen ta t ion level, especially in the 
area o f infrastructure where these three are the ma jor donor financiers in Cambodia. 

I t 

IDA resources, and the rema in ing US$6 m i l l i o n w i l l come from Cambodia’s allocation. 
No te : In FY09, projects in health, transport and a PRSC are planned. 

131. 
Investment lending w i l l be structured under the s ix CAS objectives described above rather 
than by sectoral lines w i th in the Bank. Wherever a SWAP exists, the investment projects 
described above and summarized in Table 10 w i l l be designed and imp lemen ted through the 
SWAP framework. Where n o SWAP exists, they w i l l b e designed w i t h the in ten t ion o f 
con tr ibu t ing to the development o f a sector strategy and corresponding investment plan. The AAA 
program has been reorganized to bring related s tud ies together under sectoral o r thematic cluster 
headings, w i t h designated s ta f f cluster leaders. 

132. W i th the f u l l support of the Govemment of Cambodia, the Bank’s assistance p rog ram w i l l 
make use of 
the new f lex ib le country f inanc ing parameters, but carefully and according to p re - 
specijled app l ica t ion c r i te r ia . I n d i v i d u a l projects may be financed up to 100 percent inc lud ing 
taxes and duties, based o n m e r i t and jus t i f ica t ion . Co f inanc ing w i l l s t i l l b e encouraged when 
available. Regarding l i m i t s that w o u l d apply to the overa l l amount o f recurrent expenh tures that 
the Bank may finance, there w i l l b e n o coun try- leve l limit, but decision cr i ter ia w i l l be app l ied f o r 
each project and l i n e i t em w i t h due regard to sustainability. The Bank may finance loca l costs as 
needed to achieve pro jec t objectives more e f f ic ien t ly . The Bank w i l l also be able to finance taxes 
and duties, as the tax system i s considered reasonable in Cambodia (Attachment 9 ) . 

133. 
I n add i t ion to the t rad i t iona l investmentprojects, the CAS envisages support to the reform 
program in the fo rm of annual PRSCs. These w o u l d start w i t h FY06 and w o u l d de l iver about one- 

- 4 1 - 

third o f our base case program in the f o rm o f budget support. The objective o f the proposed PRSC 
program i s to support implementation o f the Government’s r e f o rm program b y strengthening PSD, 
imp rov ing access to natural resource assets, strengthening pub l ic sector performance, and 
imp rov ing l o c a l governance (viz., supporting the po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm agenda o f the 
CAS pillars). 

134. 
The December 2004 C G Mee t ing made a strong link between the Government’s 
implementation o f reforms and donors’ contributions, w i t h b o t h the As ian Development Bank and 
the W o r l d Bank reduc ing their pledges because o f poor performance on governance. T h i s , despite 
the fact that Cambodia had satisfactorily implemented the lega l terms and conditions o f i t s 
Structural Adjustment Cred i t and PRGF programs. The Government realizes that i t must move 
f r om announcements to implementation i f i t i s to continue to receive donor support. The PRSC 
process i s designed to strengthen this linkage between results and donor assistance. I t w i l l he lp 
prov ide support to the implementation o f the po l icy agenda l a i d out in the RS and the NSDP so 
that the goals l a i d out in these strategies can be attained. 

135. At the December 2004 C G Meeting, the Government and donors agreed on a key se t o f 
reforms t o be undertaken b y the nex t C G Mee t ing in December 2005 (Attachment 3). This r e f o rm 
program was designed after extensive consultations he ld in the technical wo rk ing groups wh ich are 
l e d b y the Government and inc lude a l l donor partners. I t includes key actions in the areas o f PSD, 
P F M and land management (see B o x 8). The Government i s comm i t ted t o meeting 100 percent o f 
the C G benchmarks and has set up a mon i tor ing mechanism in the f o rm o f a Government Dono r 
Coord ina t ion Comm i t tee (GDCC) that i s to meet on a quarterly basis and mon i tor the who le 
r e f o rm program w i t h a special focus on iden t i fy ing areas o f r e f o rm that are lagg ing and need more 
concerted e f fo r t on the part o f bo th the Government and donors. 
In this regard, the first 
mon i to r ing mee t ing in M a r c h 2005 played a very use fu l r o l e in bringing to the attention o f the 
Government areas that cou ld f a l l behind and needed special attention. M a n y o f the actions agreed 
to at the December C G Mee t ing are cross-sectoral in nature and t h i s mon i to r ing mechanism brings 
an in terna l cohesion to the r e f o rm program that has been lack ing until now . The PRSC process 
w i l l be l i n k e d closely to the mon i to r ing indicators agreed at the C G Mee t ing so that the r e f o rm 
program remains government-owned and l e d and supported b y the entire donor commun i ty 
co l lec t ive ly . 

136. 
The PRSC w i l l focus on the core areas of the Bank Group’s CAS, including pr iva te sector 
development, pub l ic f inanc ia l management, and land management. O f these areas, pub l ic 
f inanc ia l management and pr iva te sector development are the farthest advanced in terms o f 
agreement o n r e f o rm measures. PRSCs wou ld be developed when B a n k management feels that 
there i s a strong l i k e l i h o o d that the re fo rm actions w i l l be undertaken and w i l l be sent f o r Boa rd 
approval once actions have already been undertaken. At the same time, the r e f o rm programs f o r 
the f o l l ow i n g year w o u l d be articulated: the second year actions f o r PSD and PFM are already l a i d 
out (although they may requ ire some fine-tuning) in the ac t ion programs and gradually additional 
r e f o rm programs w o u l d b e added on in other areas. 

137. W e w o u l d envisage broad-based donor support f o r PRSCs either d irec t ly through co- 
f inanc ing (as ind ica ted b y several donors) o r ind i rec t ly through equivalent “results-oriented” 
programs o f their own. In preparing the PRSC, the Bank w i l l continue t o w o r k closely w i t h the 
Fund o n macroeconomic mon i to r ing and the overa l l coord ina t ion o f p o l i c y re form . In particular, 
the Bank’s proposed PRSC i s be ing coordinated w i t h the Funds proposed PRGF arrangement in 
order to prov ide f o r streamlined po l icy cond i t iona l i ty . The timing i s also synchronized, as the 
Fund i s l i k e l y t o g o to i t s Boa rd w i t h the PRGF in October 2005. In addition, the Bank and Fund 
are wo rk ing c lose ly together on tw o core areas o f the CAS (PFM and PSD). 

138. 
T h e j i d u c i a l y environment in Cambodia merits special attention i n the context of 
programmatic lending. The j o i n t W o r l d B a n k -ADB IFAPER 2003, concludes that “weaknesses in 
the pub l ic expenditure and f inanc ia l management systems no t o n l y have high costs in terms o f 

- 42 - 

allocative and operational efficiency, but also create unacceptably high levels o f f iduc iary risk to 
pub l ic funds." Based on this diagnosis the Government, w i t h the support o f i t s partners, has 
developed a sequenced P F M r e f o rm program that i s expected t o y i e l d significant results over the 
C A S per iod in terms o f lowe r ing the overa l l f iduc iary risk leve l . Special f iduc iary measures w i l l 
b e considered in designing PRSC operations. 

139. 
The key principles o f PRSCs w o u l d therefore include: government-owned programs; high 
degree o f po l i t ica l commitment by the Government through a high v i s i b i l i t y program; strong links 
w i t h the pover ty reduc t ion strategy and in tegra t ion w i t h the RS and the NSDP; a id to b e p rov ided 
based o n actions already taken, thereby re in fo rc ing the l i n k s between imp lemen ta t ion o f re forms 
and donor support; alignment o f donor support beh ind a common r e f o rm agenda; reduced 
transactions costs o f de l iver ing aid; so l id mon i to r ing o f results; and safeguards to reduce f iduc ia ry 
risks. 

140. 
Ana ly t ica l and Advisory Activities (AAA). 
The Bank w i l l continue to undertake a 
s ign i f ican t program o f AAA that w i l l be clustered around the tw o pillars (and the s ix objectives) o f 

- 43 - 

the CAS to underpin our ongoing p o l i c y dialogue, project preparation activities, and push fo r 
donor coordination and a i d effectiveness (Box 9 ) . 

141. 
The AAA w o r k w i l l be structured according to the AAA cyc le approach, whereby the 
inputs are chosen to max im ize results. Each ac t iv i ty i s chosen, designed and imp lemen ted f r om 
the outset as part o f a thought-through med ium- term strategy that builds partnerships and leads 
i n t o more detailed advisory work , lend ing operations, and better a i d coordination. Examples f r om 
Cambodia o f the successful app l ica t ion o f such an approach inc lude PSD and PFM re form , in b o t h 
o f wh ich core E SW products (the Investment C l ima te Assessment and the IFAPER, respectively) 
l a i d the groundwork f o r a government r e f o rm program and supporting Bank investment project. 
Ths approach aims to m in im ize the number o f stand-alone studies (wh ich the CCR and C A E 
found to be o f l im i t e d value), instead in tegra t ing AAA w o r k more seamlessly w i t h advice on 

- 44 - 

po l icy reforms, investment operations, and a id coordination. The Pub l ic Expenditure Track ing 
Survey (PETS) in education i s another example o f AAA w o r k c lear ly designed f r om the s ta r t to 
have a strategic input to sector dialogue and po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l re form . W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te 
support w i l l be integrated w i t h other AAA w o r k to support the six C A S objectives. 

142. 
I n line w i th this approach and w i th the recommendations of 
the Bank’s LICUS review 
(Box 4 above), the Bank w i l l seek to undertake analytical wo rk as pa r t of (either leading or 
supporting) multi-partner teams, using the opportunity of analytical exercises to build consensus 
and institutional capacity around problem iden t i jca t ion and policy options. One o f the first such 
opportunities w i l l be in the preparation o f the Poverty Assessment, in w h i c h the Bank w i l l attempt 
t o draw in a broad range o f partners (the Government, other donors, NGOs and independent 
research institutes) to produce a synthesis and further elaboration o f the state o f knowledge o f 
pover ty in Cambodia. This pover ty assessment w i l l , i t i s hoped, prov ide the analytical foundation 
f o r the p o l i c y actions iden t i f ied in the new NSDP (2006-2010). 

143. 
The Bank w i l l also ensure that i t draws on up-to-date socio-political analysis throughout 
the implementation of 
the CAS. Once again, the L I C U S rev iew suggests that the understanding 
obtained f r om such analysis i s l i k e l y to be extremely impor tan t in an environment w i t h weak and 
vo la t i le institutions. I t suggests that an accurate assessment o f the governance environment and o f 
the po l i t ica l risk factors should underpin the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank’s program and the 
understanding o f the prospects f o r achieving development outcomes.

LENDING SCENARIOS AND PERFORMANCE MONITORING INDICATORS 

144. 
In FY05 , Cambodia’s IDA allocation i s $38 m i l l i o n . F o r FYO6-08 (the I D A 1 4 period), the 
annual a l loca t ion o f IDA resources to Cambodia w i l l b e determined through the performance- 
based a l loca t ion system under the I D A 1 4 p o l i c y framework, and i s expected to be in the range o f 
US$25 m i l l i o n to US$45 m i l l i o n . The actual IDA a l loca t ion cou ld be at the lowe r end o f this 
range, due t o the volume reduction based on debt sustainability (if Cambodia i s determined to be a 
highly debt-distressed country, i t w i l l receive an amount wh ich i s 20 percent lowe r but on grant 
terms) and other adjustments. In the outer years o f this C A S pe r iod lend ing amounts are ind ica t ive 
on ly , and actual amounts w i l l depend o n Cambodia’s performance, i t s performance re la t ive to the 
performance o f other IDA recipients, the amount o f ove ra l l resources available t o IDA, and the 
terms o f f inanc ia l assistance prov ided (grants versus loans). Three i l lus tra t ive lend ing scenarios 
have been developed f o r FYO6-08 and are presented in Tab le 11.

F. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

145. 
The Government recognizes the need to build i t s ins t i tu t iona l capacity in development 
management and in M&E o f the imp lemen ta t ion and outcomes o f i t s plans and strategies. 
Towards this end, the restructured Government-donor TWGs w i l l support imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
RS through development o f ac t ion plans and indicators at the sector and thematic level, w h i c h w i l l 
be j o i n t l y monitored. The Bank Group w i l l ac t ive ly support the leadership o f the TWGs in wh ich 
i t participates (Table 12) in developing sector performance mon i to r ing frameworks, ensuring that 
i t measures and assesses results in a manner w h i c h complements the wo rk o f other donors and 
broader sectoral and cross-government ownership o f M&E. 

146. 
The CAS w i l l be monitored by the C o u n t y Team once a year. 
In addition, ADB, DFID, 
UN and the W o r l d Bank w i l l j o i n t l y mon i to r and evaluate sectors in wh ich they are invo lved . 
Tw ice a year, these four partners are comm i t ted to meeting and discussing progress in 
imp lemen t ing their strategies, inc lud ing progress against outcomes and progress in w o r k i n g w i t h 
other development partners. The j o i n t rev iew w i l l also rev is i t the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
partnership principles. In another tr ipar t i te partnership discussed previously, the ADB, Japan and 

- 46 - 

the W o r l d Bank are comm i t ted to meeting in-coun try tw ice a year to mon i tor their programs and 
forge greater synergies in the implementation o f these programs. The tr ipar t i te partners have 
already me t f o r tw o successive years in Tokyo to improve a i d coord ina t ion and they p lan to 
continue w i t h t h s very use fu l exercise o n an annual basis. And f ina l ly , and most importantly, the 
bulk o f M&E w i l l continue through the TWGs and the Government’s annual commitment to 
reforms w i l l be implemented through the TWGs and mon i tored o n a quarterly basis through the 
GDCC and through the m id - te rm (half-yearly) in fo rma l C G Mee t ing and the annual C G Meeting. 
The Harmon iza t ion A c t i o n P lan and Partnership Principles (Box 6 and Attachments 6 and 7) w i l l 
also be mon i tored o n a s ix-mon th ly basis j o i n t l y w i t h the Government and the donor community 
w i t h a v iew t o s ign i f ican t ly imp rov ing the effectiveness o f the a i d p rov ided to Cambodia.

147. 
The Wo r ld Bank w i l l also continue to assist the strengthening of po l icy analysis and 
results-oriented po l icy and management systems w i th in the Govemment, building on i t s ongoing 
wo rk in re fo rm ing PFM and developing the links between PFM and cross-government, poverty- 
focused planning. Fu ture support to the development o f government capacities in the collection, 
analysis and use o f po l icy-re levan t socio-economic data (in planning, targeting, and po l icy and 
program M&E) w i l l be a strategic p r io r i ty , and w i l l invo lve building mu tua l ly - re in fo rc ing linkages 
between a number o f t r u s t funds designed f o r this purpose and core W o r l d Bank Group AAA and 
lending operations. All these activities w i l l be care fu l ly coordinated w i t h the ac t iv i t ies o f other 
donors seeking to support the development o f government capacities to mon i to r and use pover ty 
data. The objective w i l l be to he lp develop a sector-wide approach t o such support.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 

148. 
The Wo r ld Bank ’s po r t fo l io includes 13 active credits to ta l ing US$305 m i l l ion and 1 9 
grants to ta l ing US$14.8 m i l l ion . Curren t ly there are three p rob lem projects, wh ich account f o r 23 

- 47 - 

percent o f the po r t fo l io in number and 10.6 percent in commitments. The Economic and Public 
Sector Capacity Building Project (EPSCBP) 
i s rated unsatisfactory bo th in terms of 
imp lemen ta t ion progress as we l l as development objectives, and the Ru ra l Investment and L o c a l 
Governance Project (R ILGP) and the Forest Concession and Con t ro l P i l o t Project (FCCPP) are 
b o t h ra ted unsatisfactory o n implementation aspects alone. An attempt to restructure the EPSCBP 
i s ongo ing and remedial measures are be ing implemented o n the R ILGP . The FCCPP w i l l close on 
June 31, 2005. There are currently no projects po ten t ia l ly at risk. The realism and proac t iv i ty 
indices stand at 100 percent and 50 percent, respectively. The rate o f disbursement in FY03 and 
F Y 0 4 averaged 27 percent and 30 percent, respectively, mos t ly due to the large number o f o l d 
projects in the por t fo l io . 

149. Despite a good disbursement ra t io in previous years, there are a number of generic issues 
that affect por t fo l io performance. The January 2004 CPPR and a recent f iduc iary rev iew o f 120 
contracts in four projects iden t i f ied the f o l l ow i n g issues: s low and cumbersame procurement, weak 
f inanc ia l management, delayed prov is ion o f counterpart funds, weak mon i to r ing and evaluation 
systems, poor qua l i ty o f wo rk execution, and po ten t ia l leakages o f funds. 

150. 
To address these issues a t the country level, the Wo r ld Bank Group has completed an 
IFAPER and a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). The IFAPER iden t i f ied p r i o r i t y 
issues in the r e f o rm o f pub l ic finances and pub l ic administration--notably o n the c r i t ica l 
importance o f creating an adequately remunerated, meritocratic c i v i l service. The key f ind ings o f 
the CPAR are that the legislative and regulatory framework govern ing procurement activities i s 
fragmented and incomplete; knowledge o f procurement procedures i s weak in many sector 
agencies; and accountability mechanisms are almost inexistent. F o l l ow i n g discussions w i t h the 
W o r l d Bank on the findings o f these assessments, the Government has recently launched a P F M 
R e f o rm Program w h i c h w i l l address the systemic issues raised (P i l lar 1, CAS Ob jec t ive 3). 
Fa i lu re to comp ly w i t h this agenda w i l l push the W o r l d Bank ’s program in Cambodia i n t o a l o w 
case. 

151. W h i l e these measures are intended to gradually 
imp rove the Government’s ow n 
procurement practices and f iduc iary controls, the W o r l d Bank Group i s also talung i t s o w n 
measures to insulate (to the extent possible) W o r l d Bank- f inanced projects f r om the corrupt 
environment in wh ich they operate. 
In consultation w i t h the Government, the W o r l d B a n k 
undertook an in-dep th F iduc iary Rev iew o f fou r projects in Cambodia that represent about 20 
percent b y number and 25 percent b y value o f the current po r t fo l io . The objective o f the F iduc iary 
Rev iew was to iden t i fy h ow and at wh ich stages o f the pro jec t cyc le leakages o f funds may occur 
and to design measures to m in im ize leakages. The w o r k was conducted in tw o stages by a j o i n t 
team f r o m the W o r l d Bank‘s Coun try Team and the Department o f Ins t i tu t iona l In teg r i ty (INT) 
over the per iod July-December 2004. Experience gained f r om s i m i l a r programs in Indonesia and 
V ie tnam was used and the methodology employed was that in use b y INT to detect indicators o f 
fraudulent practice and other irregularities in the absence o f any specific p r io r allegations. 

152. 
The recently completed F iduc iary Rev iew con f irms that our regular procurement and 
f inanc ia l management procedures are no t always su f f ic ien t to prevent leakages and misuse o f 
funds. Clear indicators o f collusion, fraud and poor qua l i ty o f execution, ma in ly on sma l l 
contracts, and weak f inanc ia l management were uncovered. 

153. Consistent w i t h the focus o f this CAS on governance issues and g iven the need to 
s ign i f ican t ly reduce the f iduc iary and other r i s k s t o the por t fo l io , the W o r l d Bank intends to take a 
number o f add i t iona l steps to safeguard the activities i t finances. These w i l l be agreed w i t h the 
Government and incorporated in project documents and agreements, and include: 

Identify spec@ an t i-corrup t ion measures as p a r t of 
the pro jec t readiness c r i te r ia f i l t e r . 
These w o u l d inc lude iden t i fy ing and addressing project-specific f iduc iary risks, empower ing

Improve social and environmental safeguards. T o make e f fec t ive use o f the W o r l d B a n k s 
social and environment safeguards, the W o r l d Bank w i l l rev iew the Government’s capacity to 
implement safeguard policies, support the development and imp lemen ta t ion o f national 
safeguard policies, and establish 
improved mechanisms fo r repor t ing and hand l ing 
complaints.

Agree w i th the Govemment 
to enhance disclosure beyond the Wo r ld Bank’s own 
requirements b y rou t ine ly d isc los ing annual procurement plans, annual f inanc ia l statements 
and audit reports, and m id - te rm rev iew reports. The W o r l d Bank w i l l in add i t ion develop

o f the in fo rma t ion be ing disclosed and to he lp mon i tor in tegn ty and outcomes in W o r l d B a n k

Strengthen the Wo r ld Bank Group ’s own supervision mechanisms. The W o r l d Bank has 
substantially increased the s ta f f and f inanc ia l resources i t devotes to p o r t f o l i o management in 
Cambodia and i s ra is ing the awareness o f task team leaders o f the need to pay increased 
attention to risks o f corruption, w i t h procurement, f inanc ia l and operations specialists placed 
in the f ie ld . The W o r l d Bank also intends to conduct ongoing f iduc iary rev iews o f the lund 
recently undertaken to i d e n t i f y and address problems, i f necessary b y redesigning ongo ing 
operations. I t w i l l also assess the risk o f corrup t ion in i t s operations more systematically, and 
focus i t s supervision on those operations most at risk. 

Better enforcement. The W o r l d Bank i s f o l l ow i n g up systematically o n cases o f non- 
compliance, in teg r i ty issues and audit findings, and has taken and w i l l con t inue t o take strong 
remedial measures. This was shown in the case re la t ing to the Demob i l iza t ion and

VI. RISKS19 

A. 

R I S K S FACING THE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF CAMBODIA 

154. 
T h e successfil implementation of 
the Govemment's RS is subject to a number of risks. 
Cambodia i s at a c r i t ica l junc ture as i t moves away f r om a pos t-con f l ic t situation and towards a 
more norma l development paradigm. The full engagement o f Cambodia in regional and w o r l d 
relations has reduced po l i t ica l uncertainty and contributed to imp roved p o l i c y pred ic tab i l i ty , but i s 
also fo rc ing the na t ion to abide b y new pressures. The j o i n t strategies o f ADB, DFID, the UN 
system, and the W o r l d Bank have been designed w i t h measures aimed at m i t iga t ing , or managing 
these risks. 

155. Cambodia's g loba l competitiveness remains f rag i le . Cambodia's economy i s small and 
vulnerable t o shocks. Recent g row th has been heav i ly dependent o n a few sectors such as garments 
and tourism, w h i c h are vulnerable to adverse changes in the g loba l market and po l i t ica l conditions. 
I f Cambodia i s unable to d ivers i fy and broaden i t s competitiveness, prospects f o r economic g row th 
and pover ty reduc t ion cou ld be seriously undermined. The j o i n t strategies are designed to 
co l lec t ive ly m i t iga te t h i s risk b y focusing assistance on im p r o v i n g agriculture sector produc t iv i ty 
and i t s market orientation, infrastructure service prov is ion , f inanc ia l sector development, and 
creating the enabling environment fo r pr iva te sector g row th in general, and SMEs in particular. 

156. Weak capacity i n PFM and inadequate incentives fo r the c iv i l service breeds corrup t ion , 
constraints delivery of key pub l ic services and retards implementation of key reforms. 
Inadequate 
capacity to raise and manage pub l ic finances i s a key constraint o f the Government's ab i l i ty to 
achieve i t s development objectives. This d i f f i c u l t y i s worsened b y l o w pub l ic sector salaries, 
w h i c h force pub l ic servants to depend o n uno f f ic ia l charges o r other income earning opportunities 
to secure a l i v i n g wage. These factors have constrained the de l ivery o f pub l ic services, and made 
corrup t ion a ma jor problem. B y wo rk ing together w i t h development partners o n a comprehensive 
PFM r e f o rm program that incorporates systematic approaches to corrup t ion prevention and 
pos i t ive ac t ion o n the issue o f c i v i l service incentives, the fou r ins t i tu t ions w i l l a im to m i t iga te and 
manage this risk. Support f o r loca l governance i s designed to strengthen loca l voice in the 
Government, imp rove pub l ic service de l ivery and reduce opportunities f o r corruption. 

157. 

T h e var ious govemance initiatives fa l l short of expectations. There i s clear recogn i t ion 
among the Government and development partners that im p r o v i n g governance i s essential fo r 
imp roved development effectiveness. M o s t development partners have increased their focus o n 
governance and have in troduced projects and programs in t h i s area t o help build government 
capacity to govern i tse l f better, as w e l l as mechanisms to boost pub l ic accountability. However, 
governance re forms are a l o n g and complex process that requires deep and mean ing fu l reforms in 
institutions, consensus, strong in terna l conv ic t ion and ownershlp. This w i l l no t be easy and there 
may be a temptation to substitute process f o r genuine re forms i f the comm i tmen t to re forms i s 
weak. T o m i n im i z e this risk, the assistance prov ided by the three ins t i tu t ions w i l l be cond i t ioned 
o n the adequacy o f the r e f o rm e f fo r t in that the nature and vo lume o f assistance w i l l be c lear ly 
linked to progress on reforms. 

l 9 Note that in t h i s CAS the analysis o f risks facing the Government's med ium term goals (part A ) i s common text w i th 
A D B and DFID; Part B addresses t h e specific risks to the t ime ly and effective implementation o f the Bank's 
program. 

- 50 - 

158. Dono r coordination does not improve, and transaction costs fo r 
the Govemment 
increases. Better donor coordination must move beyond better relations and coord ina t ion 
discussions i n t o enhanced impact on the ground. There i s also a risk that the four organizations 
(ADB, DFID, the UN system and the W o r l d Bank) w o r k better together to the exclusion o f 
wo rk ing better w i t h other donors. T o m i t iga te this risk, the fou r partners are comm i t ted to be ing 
inc lus ive : better wo rk ing amongst themselves i s c lear ly understood as be ing on ly part o f a broader 
e f fo r t towards better co l lec t ive wo rkmg amongst a l l donors in Cambodia. Recent in i t ia t ives at 
restructuring the TWGs and on harmon iz ing donor procedures are also meant to m in im ize these 
risks and improve the effectiveness o f aid de l ivery . 

159. 
Increased complexity of projects causes de ter iora t ion in qua l i ty . The qua l i ty o f the 
p o r t f o l i o o f the four partner ins t i tu t ions may deteriorate w i t h increased comp lex i ty o f issues . 
Policies, institutions, and human resources are re la t ive ly weaker in Cambodia than in other nations 
w i t h less traumatic histories. The j o i n t strategies w i l l he lp m i t iga te this risk by con t inu ing to 
prov ide adequate TA to support project preparation, and human resource and ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
building. There w i l l also be a greater emphasis o n participatory principles i n v o l v i n g a l l 
stakeholders in the design, implementation and mon i to r ing o f projects. 

B. 

R I S K S FACING THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THE BANK GROUP CAS 

160. 
Imp lemen t ing the CAS faces bo th in terna l and external risks. These inc lude r i s k s related 
to the Government and other stakeholders. 

161. Govemment Risks. The greatest risk to the achievement o f the C A S objectives i s that the 
po l i t ica l w i l l to address 
issues o f governance w i l l no t be for thcom ing and sustained. 
Imp lemen t ing true governance reforms w i l l require long - te rm and enthusiastic government 
engagement, and wh i le the Government has shown the commitment t o addressing many issues , 
recent po l i t ica l developments show that the Government’s pos i t ion can be frag i le and there i s some 
danger that lack o f po l i t ica l cohesion cou ld undermine the commitment and resolve t o pursue 
reforms. Vested interests may also continue to hamper attempts to implement the r e f o rm program. 
In addition, the Government w i l l need t o de l iver an ambitious series o f P F M and PSD re forms in 
order t o reach the ir g row th targets and m i t iga te the g row th and poverty impacts o f the end o f the 
MFA. An extremely large Government w i t h diffuse responsibility, l im i t e d capacity and l a c k o f 
progress in c i v i l service r e f o rm are further r i s k s . Las t ly , government revenues a n d o r donor 
support are s t i l l insu f f ic ien t to raise government wages to a leve l that i s adequate enough to reduce 
dependence on patronage. The W o r l d Bank w i l l address these issues by building coa l i t ions f o r 
r e f o rm through wo rk ing w i t h champions f o r reforms. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also w o r k to gradua l ly 
build commitment in areas where champions are curren t ly lack ing and ensure that resources 
comm i t ted are con tr ibu t ing su f f ic ien t ly to the achievement o f results. 

162. Other Stakeholder Risks. G iven the leve l of ac t iv i ty in the donor commun i ty in Cambodia, 
there i s a risk that wh i le donors comm i t t o the governance agenda in principle, they w i l l , in 
practice, continue to prov ide large amounts o f assistance w i thou t a strong focus on results. There 
i s also some danger that stakeholder expectations w i l l no t be met, par t icu lar ly in d i f f i c u l t r e f o rm 
areas l i k e forestry, and the W o r l d Bank w i l l b e blamed. O n the basis o f experience during the last 
C A S period, i t i s necessary to consider the poss ib i l i ty o f d i f f i c u l t relationships w i t h NGO s and 
c i v i l society groups, and to think about h ow t o avo id a n d o r m i t iga te the r i s k s that t h i s w o u l d 
entail. The W o r l d Bank w i l l m i t iga te these risks by constant communication w i t h donors and c i v i l 
society o n many levels, Le., ge t t ing agreement o n a more focused r e f o rm agenda through the C G 
Mee t ing process, alignment t o the NSDP and sectoral strategies, mu l t i-donor par t ic ipa t ion i n the 
PRSC program, and h igh- leve l management support and communication w i t h donor head offices. 
In addition, the Bank Group w i l l increase commun ica t ion and outreach to ensure that i t s role, 
challenges, and r i s k s are w e l l understood.

V I I . CONCLUDING REMARKS 

163. The W o r l d Bank rev iew o f Cambodia's development progress and prospects produced 
before the last (December 2004) C G Mee t ing concluded that Cambodia was "at a crossroads." I t 
cou ld choose either to exp l ic i t ly and who le-hea ted ly embrace re form , o r to continue w i t h the path 
taken, wh ich has no t yet l e d t o significant or sustainable pover ty reduction, and i s increasingly 
un l ike ly to do so in the pos t -MFA wor ld . T h i s CAS i s intended to support the Government in 
choosing and f o l l ow i n g the harder pa th o f systematic re form . I t i s intended t o build o n the lessons 
the Bank Group has learned to date and to support recent pos i t ive developments in government 
commitments and in imp roved donor behavior. In do ing so, i t aims t o bring the Bank Group's

A. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This CAS Comp le t ion Report evaluates the effectiveness o f the W o r l d Bank's last Coun try 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Cambodia. T h i s CAS was discussed on February 7 , 2000 and was 
intended to cover the per iod F Y O O - F Y O 3 . However , elections in m id-2003 resulted in a po l i t ica l 
impasse w h i c h was on ly resolved w i t h the forma t ion o f a new coa l i t ion Government i n Ju ly 2004, 
almost a year after the elections. The formu la t ion o f a new C A S has also been delayed somewhat to 
re f lec t an agreement reached in 2003 among the As ian Development Bank (ADB), UK Department 
fo r In terna t iona l Development (DFID) and the W o r l d Bank Group, in wh ich they comm i t ted 
themselves to a process o f preparing their new country strategies j o i n t l y , w i t h common consultations 
and shared analytical text. T h i s report accordingly describes the imp lemen ta t ion o f the W o r l d Bank 
country program in Cambodia up to the per iod o f w r i t i n g in early M a r c h 2005. Append ix 1 
summarizes the progress made towards the ma in goals set ou t in the CAS and the lessons learned. 
Appendices 2 and 3 compare planned and actual de l ivery o f lend ing and non-lending assistance, 
respectively.

Cambodia was devastated b y po l i t ica l violence in the 1970s. C i v i l war ended in 1975 in the 
v ic to ry o f a gue r i l la movement (the Khmer Rouge) that sought t o uproo t a l l pre-existing social and

However, Cambodia i s s t i l l in many respects a pos t-con f l ic t country in wh ich fo rma l 
ins t i tu t ions o f the state rema in weak re la t ive to (po l i t ica l ly unstable) i n f o rm a l ins t i tu t ions o f patronage

that drove economic g row th are n ow threatened b y the end o f the M u l t i -F i b e r Arrangement (MFA) on 
December 31, 2004. There i s urgent need f o r a more d ivers i f ied , inc lus ive and sustainable pattern o f 
economic growth, and f o r dramatic improvements in de l ivery o f basic services. The latter w i l l requ ire 
fundamental re forms in pub l ic f inanc ia l management (PFM) and the pay and management o f c i v i l 
servants.

The 2000 CAS aimed to support the transition o f Cambodia’s development e f for ts f r om a 
pos t-con f l ic t focus o n reconstruction and rehab i l i ta t ion to a focus on sustainable grow th and pover ty 
reduc t ion over the medium to long-term. G iven the large number o f donors and limited con tr ibu t ion 
o f Bank f inanc ing to total o f f i c i a l development assistance (ODA ) in Cambodia (about 10 percent), the 
CAS correc t ly iden t i f ied the need f o r enhanced partnerships and donor coordination as fundamental to 
im p r o v i n g development effectiveness in Cambodia. The CAS p r io r i t ized outcomes related to 
governance, service delivery and the investment climate. These were f u l l y consistent w i t h 
Cambodia’s ow n p r io r i ty development objectives. The CAS also prov ided a well-structured 
framework f o r mon i tor ing implementation progress, inc lud ing anticipating a “results framework” w i t h 
Bank-specific and more general indicators f o r each area o f proposed assistance. 

5 . 

The CAS Comp le t ion Report concludes that the CAS program was delivered b y and large as 
anticipated, albeit w i t h a significant number o f projects slipping b y a year or more, and some be ing 
dropped. Even a l low ing fo r the delay in implementation, i t appears that de l ivery o f the program 
resulted in very uneven progress towards C A S outcomes. The importance o f addressing governance 
and developing and sustaining broad partnerships f o r r e f o rm were iden t i f ied in the CAS, b u t were no t 
e f fec t ive ly operationalized in part because o f a lack o f full understanding o f the nature o f the 
governance challenge, and in part because the f ie ld presence required t o lead or participate in 
partnerships was late in developing. T h e approach adopted was also somewhat piecemeal, spreading 
the Bank Group’s resources too th in ly across too many sectors. 

B. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

6. 
In 2000, the CAS c i ted the Government’s P la t form on the Second Term (1998-2003) as the 
main reference po in t in iden t i fy ing the long- term strategic goals o f the Roya l Government o f 
Cambodia (RGC). The p la t fo rm focused o n reduc ing pover ty by : (i) safeguarding social s tab i l i ty and 
security; (ii) b u i l d i n g human capacity; (iii) strengthening infrastructure and fostering an environment 
f o r pr iva te investment; ( iv) f u l l y pro tec t ing and preserving the natural environment; (v) enhancing 
na t iona l revenues in the context o f a fully accountable and transparent f isca l po l icy ; and (v i) 
encouraging the pr iva te sector as an engine o f growth, investment and employment creation. W h i l e 
no t c i ted in the CAS document, the p l a t f o rm was consistent w i t h Cambodia’s First Socioeconomic 
Development P lan (SEDP1) cover ing the years 1996 to 2000 wh ich in add i t ion placed emphasis o n 
addressing constraints to rural pover ty reduction. 

7. 

F r om this set o f objectives, the C A S chose to support three key p i l lars : namely, imp roved 
governance, access to service de l ivery f o r the poor, and an imp roved po l icy environment f o r pr iva te 
sector development. The choice o f these three areas as pr ior i t ies f o r long- term development was 
sensible, and remains so today. As the Government fur ther expanded on i ts development pr ior i t ies (in 
the Second Socio-Economic Development P lan (SEDP2) in November 2002; the Na t iona l Pover ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy (NPRS -Cambod ia ’s PRSP) in M a r c h 2003; 
the Cambodian M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goa l Report (CMDGR ) in Ju ly 2003; and the Rectangular Strategy in 2004), these three 
pillars remained relevant and compatible w i t h what the Government and i t s partners saw as p r i o r i t y 
needs. 

8 . 

The med ium- term r e f o rm strategy o f the Government, as 
l a i d out in the Le t ter o f 
Development Po l icy that accompanied the FYOO SAC, was 
to 
increase domestic revenue 
mob i l iza t ion , 
improve 
inadequate and 
ine f f ic ien t pub l ic expenditure management and 
environmentally unsustainable forest management, and r e f o rm the pub l ic sector.

C . CAS OUTCOMES 

P i l la r I : Good govemance 

9 . 

Despite important progress in revenue mob i l iza t ion and the ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r land 
management, progress in other aspects o f governance was less than had been anticipated in the CAS . 

10. 
Progress i n tackling pub l ic sector corrup t ion focused p r ima r i ly on analyses and strategies, 
w i t h l i t t le evidence of enforcement o r results. A l though no t o f f i c i a l l y ranked b y Transparency 
International, po l ls o f perceived levels o f corrup t ion ( inc lud ing the Bank ’s ow n G loba l Po l l ) place 
Cambodia amongst the most corrupt countries in the region. A corrup t ion diagnostic in M a y 2000 
introduced improved methodologies f o r analyzing impacts o f corruption, but the Government chose 
n o t to disseminate the report and there was n o f o l l ow up. Some training was prov ided t o government 
staff in accounting and aud i t ing procedures and project f inanc ia l management systems were 
implemented in a l l Bank-financed projects. W h i l e a Governance A c t i o n P lan was completed w i t h 
Bank assistance by January 2001, dissemination was limited and there has been l i t t l e progress in key 
actions (e.g., the passage o f an anti-corruption l aw or impos i t ion o f administrative sanctions when 
corrup t ion was verified). In terna t iona l accounting standards were adopted in 2003 and laws o n audit, 
customs and budget d isc ip l ine were promulgated but have yet to b e thorough ly implemented. The 
Na t iona l Audit Au tho r i ty was established in late 2001 and, w i t h donor assistance, i s gradually gaining 
capacity. 

11. 
F rom 2004, there has been some progress in developing RGC commitments to and programs 
fo r tackling corrup t ion . T h e Bank has used key pieces o f h igh-qua l i ty AAA, prepared w i t h an active 
e f fo r t to inc lude partners, to he lp establish a government-owned r e f o rm program. An Integrated 
F iduc iary Assessment and Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iew (IFAPER) l e d t o the development o f a ten- 
donor sector program o f sequenced P F M reforms; an Investment C l ima te Assessment similarly l a i d 
the groundwork f o r an RGC program o f r e f o rm o f the environment f o r pr iva te sector development. 
The B a n k s report to the C G meeting “Cambodia: A t the Crossroads” in December 2004 helped to 
establish a common donor perspective o n the centrality o f governance re forms f o r Cambodia’s long- 
term development ’. 
12. 
Progress i n legal and jud ic ia l reform was very limited. 
Several donors are p rov id ing 
technical assistance to support the de f in i t ion o f legal regulations w i t h the ongoing development o f 
cr im ina l , c i v i l , and commercial codes. A dra f t mu l t i-year leg is la t ive r e f o rm program tabled at the 
2001 C G meeting was f ina l ized in 2001 and Cambodia acceded to the N ew Y o r k Conven t ion on 
Fore ign Arbitral Awards the same year. T h e Counc i l f o r Lega l and Jud ic ia l R e f o rm was established 
in June 2002 as a senior-level coord ina t ing mechanism f o r national ins t i tu t ions invo lved in lega l and 
j u d i c i a l re form . In terms o f assistance to RGC institutions, a Roya l School f o r Magistrates was 
established and a new, mo re compe t i t ive and transparent salary structure outside the very l o w c i v i l 
service pay scales was adopted f o r judges and prosecutors. Problems are however systemic and w i l l 
require complementary “demand-side’’ interventions (that i s , interventions to he lp strengthen the 
capacity o f non-state actors e f fec t ive ly to demand state de l ivery o f the r u l e o f law) . 

13. 
During the f i rs t three years o f the CAS period, the Bank carr ied ou t in terna l diagnostic 
assessments o f Cambodia’s ex is t ing lega l and jud ic ia l systems and assisted the R G C in i t s e f for ts to 
formulate i t s forma l Lega l and Jud ic ia l R e f o rm Strategy and accompanying dra f t A c t i o n Plans. This 
Strategy was adopted in June 2003 and the Short- to Med ium -Te rm A c t i o n P lan in November 2004. 
During the 2000-2003 period, the Bank also helped to lead the donor w o r k i n g group o n Lega l and 
Judicial Re fo rm ( i n i t i a l l y a sub-committee o f the Dono r W o r k i n g Group o n Govemance), 
notwithstanding the obvious difficulty in organizing these e f for ts f r o m Washington. A planned 
project, however, did not ma ter ia l ize because o f g row ing concerns w i t h i n the Bank regarding a lack o f

- 5 5 - 

senior-level RGC commitment to the implementation o f a concerted lega l and jud ic ia l r e f o rm agenda 
w i t h i n the Execu t ive and Judicial branches o f the Government. 

14. 
Some m i l i tary demobilization occurred, but the donor-supported process came to a ha l t due 
to misprocurement. I n i t i a l progress (in Bank- led donor coord ina t ion and AAA f o r the design, 
imp lemen ta t ion and evaluation o f a p i l o t program f o r 1,500 soldiers) l e d to the development o f a full- 
scale program f o r the demobilization o f another 30,000 soldiers, supported by US$42 m i l l i o n f r om 
f i v e donors ( inc lud ing a US$22.4 m i l l i o n Bank credit, w h i c h had no t been anticipated in the CAS). 
With the trans i t ion f r om p i l o t to full-scale project, demob i l iza t ion became much more problematic. 
Irregu lar i t ies in the registration database raised concerns regarding the po ten t ia l con tr ibu t ion o f the 
program to broader defense re form . The program has been stalled since June 2003, when the Bank 
declared misprocurement f o r a major contract f o r motorcycles prov ided as part o f reintegration 
assistance. In total, 16,500 soldiers were demob i l ized w i t h some reintegration assistance, but w i t h the 
suspension o f government implementation, mon i to r ing has no t been su f f ic ien t to determine the 
current status o f the former soldiers and their families. The demob i l iza t ion program did no t inc lude 
any systematic land allocation. Demob i l iza t ion does appear to have contributed to reduction in 
defense expenditures ( f r om 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 2.8 percent in 2002), although the lack o f 
transparency around all defense spending i s such that the accuracy o f these figures must be treated 
w i t h caution. 

15. 
Pub l ic administration reform has lagged, relative even to the modest objectives se t a t the time 
of the CAS. A med ium- term v is ion wh ich articulates the r o l e o f the c i v i l service, consistent w i t h on- 
go ing decentralization and f isca l constraints, has yet to be completed. There i s an on-going program 
f o r de f in ing c i v i l service s ta f f ing requirements, supported b y the Bank, wh ich cou ld prov ide the basis 
f o r adjusting the pub l ic sector wage bill, inc lud ing d i f feren t ia t ion o f wage leve l , in l i n e w i t h 
func t iona l needs. However, a s i m i l a r scheme ( fo r “P r io r i ty M iss ion Groups”) approved b y the 
Counc i l o f M in is ters in late 2002 has been rudderless. Bank support ( inc lud ing AAA and a credit to 
support the Econom ic and Pub l ic Sector Capacity Building Project to train c i v i l servants) has 
proceeded despite a d i f f i c u l t po l icy dialogue. Fundamental disagreements based on the opposition o f 
vested interests to r e f o rm delayed and undermined the Bank ’s ab i l i ty to support the r e f o rm agenda 
and the func t iona l analysis planned fo r 2004 was no t carr ied out. Nonetheless, a c i v i l service census 
was completed in 2000 and 9,000 irregular or “ghost” workers were iden t i f ied and removed f r om the 
payro l l . 

16. 
Mo re progress has been seen w i th regard to domestic revenue mobilization. Fo rma l domestic 
revenue co l lec t ion increased f r om 9 percent o f GDP in 1999 t o 12 percent in 2002; the share o f non- 
tax revenues has increased f r om 2.7 percent o f GDP in 1999 t o 3.2 percent o f GDP in 2002, but there 
i s considerable r o om f o r improvement in b o t h tax and non-tax revenue co l lec t ion g iven inferences 
about i n f o rm a l revenue collection. 

17. 
In the forestry sector, revenues declined f r om 0.3 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 0 .1 percent o f 
GDP in 2002, re f lec t ing the sharp decline i n forestry’s con tr ibu t ion to GDP ( f r om 3.4 percent o f GDP 
in 2000 to 2.2 percent o f GDP in 2002), even though roya l ty rates have been established at 
US$54/cubic meter. These declines were due in part t o the suspension o f logg ing and l o g transport 
wh ich the Government imposed f o l l ow i n g delays in the imp lemen ta t ion o f concession ra t iona l iza t ion 
and concerns vo iced b y donors and NGOs that commerc ia l logg ing was no t be ing e f fec t ive ly 
controlled. A Rev iew o f Sustainable Forestry Management Plans requ ired under the Forest 
Concessions Sub-decree resulted in several cancellations (the number o f concessions dec l ined f r om 
25 in 2000 to 8 in 2003). A new Forest L a w was promulgated in 2002 and a Commun i ty Forestry 
Sub-decree in mid-2003, and the Government has comm i t ted t o the development o f a Na t iona l Forest 
Po l icy . The R o y a l Government’s o f f i c i a l independent forest mon i tor , G loba l Witness (GW), was 
replaced by SGS towards the end o f the CAS per iod (SGS’ appointment was con f irmed in December 
2003). T h i s f o l l ow e d tw o years o f accusations and counter-accusations regarding access to and 
release o f in forma t ion , government’s commitment to enforcement, and specific allegations against 
government o f f ic ia ls . Concerns were raised b y NGO s that the new mon i to r wou ld no t aggressively 

- 56 - 

seek out forest crime as GW had. The qua l i ty o f forest c r im e repor t ing and fo l low -up has been 
irregular, and prosecution insu f f ic ien t to serve as an e f fec t ive deterrent. 

18. 
Bank support to the forest sector was based o n AAA, carried out p r i o r to the CAS period, 
wh ich focused o n ra t iona l iz ing the concession management system, w h i l e a Learn ing and Innova t ion 
Cred i t (and cond i t iona l i ty under the SAC) supported the Forestry Concession Management Project. 
T h i s was another d i f f i c u l t re fo rm area, once again due to resistance f r om vested interests, b u t also due 
to the Bank operating in the middle o f a h i g h l y contentious dialogue between the Government and 
international NGOs. Despite reasonable progress on many elements o f the r e f o rm agenda, a complex 
environment undermined a collaborative and pos i t ive r e f o rm process and the Bank frequently found 
i tse l f under attack (most recently in a G loba l Witness report o f November 2004). The Bank 
contributed to funding f o r a mu l t i-donor rev iew o f the forestry sector: the recommendations arising 
f r om this rev iew are n ow being discussed between the Government and donors through the f o r um o f 
the sectoral Technical W o r k i n g Group (TWG). 

19. 
Overa l l allocative efJiciency of pub l ic expenditure has improved, but actual disbursements 
are often low, late and unpredictable. To ta l expenditures achieved s l igh t ly over the budget target in 
2002 w i t h 113 percent. Budgetary allocations to p r i o r i t y sectors increased f r om 2.3 percent to 3.6 
percent o f GDP between 2000 and 2002: wh i le cash disbursement to these sectors remained slow, 
reaching less than 30 percent o f the budget p lan f o r the health and education m in is tr ies in mid-2003, 
progress has been made since then, w i t h the 2002 and 2003 back log cleared in these sectors, together 
w i t h most o f the 2004 budget. Overall, however, progress in this area has been l im i ted , despite a high 
qua l i ty Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iew carried out just p r io r to the CAS. Some progress has been made 
where other donors (IMF and- ADB) have been active under the IMF-coord ina ted Technical 
Cooperation Program (TCAP) and some pub l ic expenditure management training has been prov ided 
under the TCAP . However, these developments have no t resulted in substantial improvements in the 
budget management process (although ADB - funded TA has supported the preparation o f MTEFs f o r 
tw o m in is tr ies-educa t ion and health-with 
additional ministries to be added over time) and, in 
general, f inanc ia l management processes and procedures rema in opaque and inadequate. An 
Integrated F iduc iary Assessment and Pub l ic Expenditure Rev iew in 2004 prov ided fo l low -up to 
TC A P and established the basis f o r targeting direct Bank support through a more focused, 
programmatic P F M R e f o rm Program (PFMRP) launched b y the Prime M in is te r in December 2004 
and supported by 10 donors. 

20. 
The legal and institutional framework fo r land administration and management improved 
significantly over the CAS period. A new M i n i s t r y o f L a n d Management, U rban P lann ing and 
Construction (M LMUPC ) was established in 1999 and consulted w i t h various stakeholders in the 
preparation and promu lga t ion o f a new and comprehensive L a n d L a w in 2001. An in ter-m in is ter ia l 
Counc i l f o r L a n d Po l icy , hosted at M LM U P C , has helped to integrate a l l land-related issues and 
prov ide a po l icy , regulatory and imp lemen ta t ion framework f o r a l l agencies. The Ministry has been 
strengthened and, w i t h considerable donor assistance ( f r om W o r l d Bank, ADB, GTZ and Finland), 
has s ign i f ican t ly expanded t i t l i n g activities and disseminated in fo rma t ion on l a n d po l ic ies and 
regulations. However, land t i t l i n g ac t iv i t ies rema in l im i t e d in coverage, despite the creation o f a 
Na t iona l Cadastral Commission w i t h operational un i ts at the national, p rov inc ia l and d is t r ic t levels in 
2002. 

21. 
The M i n i s t r y has started w o r k o n land use planning, establishing guidelines f o r Par t ic ipa tory 
L a n d Use P lann ing (PLUP) and an in ter-m in is ter ia l task force to coordinate issues re la t ing t o land use 
planning, p r io r i t iz ing the enforcement o f p lann ing processes in economically impo r tan t areas o f the 
country. Land disputes rema in a concern, par t icu lar ly between loca l communities and forest and 
economic concessions. The 2001 L a n d L a w includes provisions fo r limiting the size o f economic 
concessions and fac i l i ta t ing red is tr ibu t ion o f state lands to farmers through social concessions. The 
sub-decree in support o f social concessions was passed ahead o f expectations in M a r c h 2003 and 
some p i l o t activities are under formu la t ion : the Bank supported these w i t h a Pover ty and Social 

- 57 - 

Impact Analysis in 2004. A framework f o r economic concessions was elaborated in June 2003 and a 
national W o r k i n g Group on Economic Concessions was established t o address k e y concems. 

22. 
The Bank has prov ided substantial support to the development o f land p o l i c y through AAA 
and through lend ing to support the Land Management and Adm in is t ra t ion Project (LMAP). L M A P 
has become the Government's p r ima ry mechanism fo r coord ina t ion o f land-related in i t ia t ives 
( inc lud ing German, Finnish and more recently, Canadian assistance in add i t ion to that prov ided b y the 
Bank). A technical wo rk ing group has been formed to complement the project coordination 
mechanism and assist the Government and donors in formu la t ing a more forma l , sector-wide 
approach. Technical assistance f r om the Bank and ADB helped the Government develop a Land 
Po l icy , a L a n d L a w and several sub-decrees on land tenure and security. M a p p i n g and registration 
has proceeded in p i l o t areas as the basis fo r the design o f the LMAP. Regular stakeholder 
consultations have been an impor tan t element o f the program. 

P i l la r 2: Greater access fo r the poor to basic social services and economic opportunities 

23. 
Progress in social service de l ivery has generally been mo re pos i t ive than in the core areas o f 
governance re form . However, improvements in physical fac i l i t ies and personnel tra in ing have 
outpaced gains in the accessibility and maintenance o f services w h i c h have been undermined b y 
corrupt practices wh ich increase the costs o f fac i l i ty construction, reduce the funds actually received 
at the po in t o f service delivery, and impose uno f f ic ia l costs on use rs o f hea l th and education services. 

24. 
Although Cambodia's health indicators remain extremely poo r , improvements have occurred 
in several indicators, reflecting good progress i n reform of 
the sector. The Hea l th Sector Strategic 
Plan fo r 2003 to 2007 has p r io r i t ized health service improvements and i s be ing used as the basis fo r 
sector f inanc ing w i t h broad donor and N G O support. A l though the Bank contributed to the 
development o f the strategy, this con tr ibu t ion was l im i t e d b y the absence o f regular, in-coun try staff 
engagement. This was addressed later in the CAS period, when a new s ta f f member was recruited and 
began par t ic ipa t ing ac t ive ly in the hea l th sector TWG . The Bank's m a i n con tr ibu t ion to the progress 
made in strengthening the framework f o r health service de l ivery was through: (i) AAA wh ich 
focused o n health care financing: and (ii) lend ing under the Disease C o n t r o l and Hea l th Development 
Project and subsequently the Hea l th Sector Support Project. 
Ins t i tu t iona l capacity and health 
infrastructure have steadily improved. Re tra in ing o f pub l ic sector hea l th staff has been in i t ia ted as 
planned, although redeployment has yet to be carried out. The funding o f communicable diseases 
programs has increased s ign i f ican t ly w i t h support f r om the G loba l Fund and IDA grants: but, wh i le 
the ava i lab i l i ty , pr ice and qua l i ty o f medicines have improved, shortages o f essential drugs are s t i l l 
encountered in hea l th centers and re ferra l hospitals due to unpredictable budget disbursement and 
procurement delays. Budge t implementation-and 
s low and uneven disbursement o f the recurrent 
budget in particular-is 
a serious and long-standing constraint. W h i l e per capita contact rate w i t h 
health services has increased (to 0.38 percent in 2002), i t i s s t i l l much lowe r than WHO-se t 
international standards f o r l o w income countries (0.6 percent f o r the rural areas and 1 percent f o r 
urban areas). T h e regu la tory framework f o r pr iva te prov is ion o f hea l th services-identified 
as a 
p r io r i ty in the sector plan-is 
s t i l l to be developed. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs to households 
rema in high at US$34 per capita per annum. 

25. 
Educational outcomes also reflected good progress. The Educa t ion Sector Support Strategy 
has prov ided a framework f o r donor and N G O support and fac i l i ta ted mon i to r ing and supervision o f 
sectoral progress, he lp ing the M i n i s t r y to make e f fec t ive use o f increasing budget allocations (wh ich 
rose to 15.7 percent o f to ta l government recurrent expenditure). Ne t enrolment rates in 2001/02 were 
s l igh t ly higher than C A S targets (e.g., p r ima ry education rates o f 87 percent, compared to 85 percent 
target: and female l ow e r secondary enrolment rates o f 16 percent, compared to 15.5 percent target). 
Increases i n enrolments, however, have brough t about increases in the overa l l pupi1:teacher ra t io 
levels (now at 5 7 : l ) . E f fo r ts at accreditation at the tertiary leve l foundered in 2002, when the Counc i l 

- 58 - 

o f M in is te rs became heav i ly invo lved in the accreditation o f ind iv idua l institutions; a Sub-decree i s 
n ow issued f o r each pr iva te ins t i tu t ion o f higher learning. 

26. 
The Bank's program in support o f education was sound, although-as 
in much o f the Bank's 
coun try program-in 
this per iod quite heav i ly oriented t o analysis and p i lo t ing , taking the f o rm o f a 
Learning and Innova t ion Loan (LIL), in the f o rm o f the Education Qua l i ty Improvement Project 
(EQIP), w h i c h has fostered greater professional dialogue o n h ow t o improve schools. Enro lmen t rates 
have increased and repe t i t ion rates fa l len in school clusters supported b y the project. The project 
AAA associated w i t h preparation o f higher education sector credits led to the promu lga t ion o f a 
Decree o n Accreditation, although there are concerns regarding the independence o f the accreditation 
committee under the current ins t i tu t iona l arrangements. An Educa t ion Sector Support Program was 
developed and has become the mode l f o r coordinated, government-led sector programs. As in other 
sectors, a l a c k o f in-coun try presence l im i t e d the Bank 's capacity to contribute to po l icy dialogue. 

27. 
There was significant upgrading of 
roads before and dur ing the CAS period. The Bank 
con tr ibu ted to the building or rebu i ld ing o f rural roads (a ma jor strategic development p r i o r i t y o f the 
Government), and helped to establish guidelines f o r future transport sector re fo rm through the Road 
Rehab i l i ta t ion Project (although project imp lemen ta t ion was delayed b y complications in the 
procurement process and i t i s no t yet clear h ow operation and maintenance f inanc ing w i l l be assured). 
A transport strategy adopted in 2002 provides some c la r i f ica t ion regarding management roles f o r 
national, prov inc ia l , and ru ra l roads. This has enhanced coord ina t ion between the relevant 
government ministries, although the ro le o f the m i l i t a r y in road rehab i l i ta t ion activities remains a 
contentious issue. Despite these improvements, the qua l i ty o f transport infrastructure remains a 
serious constraint to growth. A road maintenance fund was established in 2002 based o n revenues 
f r om tax o n fuel but an effective mechanism f o r management o f the funds has yet to be established, 
and contracting f o r road works remains nontransparent. The anticipated SWAP f o r roads was n o t 
introduced. 

28. 
Urban water supply and sanitation coverage improved over the CAS period. Access t o safe 
water supply in 2000 (30 percent) exceeded the target f o r 2002 (17 percent), implying that i t should 
be possible to reach the Cambodia MDG target o f 50 percent b y 2015. However, Cambodia's sectoral 
performance indicators rema in amongst the lowes t in the wor ld . Through the U rban Water Supp ly 
and Sanitation Project, the Bank supported water supply ava i lab i l i ty in Phnom Penh. The number o f 
metered water connections increased and unaccounted water consumption dropped dramatically, 
wh i le average ava i lab i l i ty increased to meet and exceed the CAS target o f 16 hours per day. The 
Phnom Penh Water Au tho r i ty i s seen as a real success story, inc lud ing the p i lo t ing and evaluation o f 
innova t ive mechanisms f o r ensuring access to water supply and sanitation f o r poor communities. D u e 
to delays in de l iver ing the Prov inc ia l and Per i-Urban Water Supp ly Project (o r ig ina l ly part o f the 
P rov inc ia l Infrastructure Project), the Bank has no t contributed d irec t ly to prov inc ia l t ow n and ru ra l 
water supply and sanitation access in the ways o r ig ina l ly anticipated in the CAS . Pr iva te investment 
in water supply and sanitation has increased l i t t l e due to the absence o f appropriate regu la tory 
framework; a regulatory body was eventually established in Ju ly 2003. 

29. 
Electricity provision also improved. An E lec t r ic i ty A c t passed in February 2001 established 
ins t i tu t iona l roles and a new lega l and po l icy basis f o r e lec tr ic i ty generation and d is tr ibu t ion . The 
Government's rural e lec tr i f ica t ion strategy (comb in ing grid expansion w i t h support 
t o the 
development o f small, independent producers) has resulted in some improvements in coverage and 
reduc t ion in prices: despite this, e lec tr ic i ty remains extremely expensive compared to ne ighbor ing 
countries. The f inanc ia l pos i t ion o f the state-owned E lec tr ic i t6 du Cambodge (EDC) remains 
precarious due p r inc ipa l ly to h i g h e lec tr ic i ty produc t ion costs (based almost exclusively o n impo r ted 
f u e l o r IF'P-purchased power, b o t h payable in U S dollars) and a past o f poor co l lec t ion o f government 
arrears. As the Ru ra l E lec tr i f ica t ion Project anticipated f o r F Y O l was no t approved until FY 0 3 (due in 
large part to complications w i t h potential co- f inanc ing arrangements), the Bank has no t con tr ibu ted 
d i rec t ly to e lec tr ic i ty access. However, po l icy advice and studies during project preparation have 
d i rec t ly contributed t o imp rov ing EDC ' s f inanc ia l pos i t ion .

Income eaming opportunities in ru ra l areas have improved somewhat w i t h overall grow th 
and improvements i n infrastructure (w i th more ru ra l roads and some increase i n the area under 
i r r iga t ion ) , despite l im i ted progress i n agriculture. A l loca t ion o f investment expenditure t o ru ra l areas 
has increased s l igh t ly (ma in ly financed through OD A ) and can b e expected to increase more rap id ly 
as the commune councils elected in 2002 have increased the po l i t ica l vo ice o f r u r a l communities and 
increased the focus o f the Government and donors o n supporting decentralization through investment 
support ( inc lud ing direct funding o f commune investment budgets through the Seila program). The 
Bank prov ided direct support to ru ra l income earning opportunities and l ive l ihoods through a number 
o f projects, inc lud ing the on-going Ag r icu l tu ra l Improvement Project and the Northeast V i l lage 
Development Project. In response to the large floods in 2000, a F l o o d Emergency Rehab i l i ta t ion 
Project and supplemental Social Fund Project were appraised in F y O l to support reconstruction o f 
rural and national roads, i r r iga t ion systems and schools. A commun i ty-dr iven Ru ra l Investment and 
L o c a l Governance Project f o r support to the new commune councils was approved in FY03 . Overa l l 
f o o d security has been maintained and income earning opportunities have increased in some ru ra l 
areas. However, significant constraints-weak governance, an unattractive environment fo r pr iva te 
investment, vu lnerab i l i ty to natural disasters, and l im i t e d access to land and other produc t ive inputs- 
have limited overa l l g row th in agriculture and natural resources to average annual rates o f o n l y 3.2 
percent per annum (compared to the CAS target o f 4.5 percent). Ag r icu l tu ra l d ivers i f ica t ion has been 
limited w i t h r ice and fisheries produc t ion con t inu ing to account f o r 33 percent o f agr icu l tura l and 
natural resources GDP (compared t o 38 percent in 2000). W h i l e specific data i s n o t available, the 
contrast between slow g row th in agriculture and r a p i d g row th in manufacturing and services makes i t 
l i k e l y that the rural-urban income gap has expanded considerably. 

P i l l a r 3: Policy environment that encourages pr iva te investment and entrepreneurship 

31. 
There have been on ly very l im i t e d gains in the environment f o r pr iva te sector development 
over the CAS period, despite some improvements in leg is la t ion and regulations. Impo r tan t gains were 
made in trade relations through b i la tera l agreements (e.g., quota agreements w i t h the U S and EU f o r 
garments and footwear), mu l t i la tera l agreements w i t h ASEAN , and accession t o WTO in September 
2003'. Financial sector r e f o rm has improved the foundations o f the sector (wh ich rema in qu i te 
shallow, w i t h bank deposits representing o n l y 12 percent o f GDP and commercial bank loans o n l y 8 
percent o f GDP). A poo r ly defined and corrupt lega l system and high levels o f b r ibe ry and r e d tape 
rema in serious constraints to business ac t iv i ty . Some d ivers i f ica t ion in the sources o f economic 
g row th occurred w i t h stronger g row th in services (ma in ly tourism) and manu fac tur ing (ma in ly 
garments, wh ich grew b y an average o f 18 percent per annum and account f o r over 75 percent o f 
exports). However, the problems w i t h the overa l l investment c l ima te were re f lec ted in the l im i t e d 
g row th in total investment (16.6 percent o f GDP in 2002 compared to a CAS target o f 22 percent) and 
in the con t inu ing decline o f FDI (wh ich contracted b y 22 percent in 2002). Apart f r om the problems 
arising f r om underdeveloped ins t i tu t ions f o r transparent and e f fec t ive economic governance, g row th 
and d ivers i f ica t ion in the Cambodian economy are also constrained b y inadequate infrastructure and 
s h i f t s in regional and g loba l trad ing opportunities. 

32. 
Support to the pr iva te sector has focused o n coord ina t ion and capacity building to enhance 
s k i l l s and increase the ab i l i ty o f the pr iva te sector to engage in p o l i c y dialogue. A regular pr iva te 
sector f o r um was established by the Government w i t h a f u l l - t im e fac i l i ta tor prov ided by IFC . The 
F o r um meets tw ice a year w i t h the P r ime M in is te r and his cabinet and more frequen t ly w i t h relevant 
l i n e ministries to address constraints in the business environment. M P D F has ac t ive ly supported the 
forma t ion and consolidation o f business associations, inc lud ing silk weavers and other SME-based 
enterprises. W o r k o n the framework f o r leasing began towards the end o f the CAS period. 
App l ica t ions fo r I F C equ i ty par t ic ipa t ion increased w i t h expansion o f the MFDF o f f ice in Cambodia, 
but the number o f qua l i fy ing sponsors remained l ow , due in part to weak corporate governance and in 
part t o the small size o f most Cambodian enterprises (and the forma l pr iva te sector as a whole). 
' Cambodia was amongst the first LDCs to j o i n the WTO. Accession was made possible w i th an extensive 
program o f support trough the Integrated Framework mechanism.

A h igh -p ro f i le piece o f AAA wo rk on the investment climate, f ina l ized in August 2004, 
quan t i f ied and p r io r i t ized the various barr iers to investment and growth. I t also helped s t a r t to change 
the perceptions o f the pr iva te sector i n Cambodia w i t h regard to the Bank, perceptions wh ich had 
i n i t i a l l y been marked b y tension because o f the B a n k s ro le in supporting a t igh ten ing up o f tax 
concessions g iven out under the previous investment law . The analytical wo rk conducted towards the 
end o f the C A S per iod has helped to improve the tone o f this relationship, as pr iva te sector actors 
have begun to see the Bank as a strategic a l l y in tack l ing the systematic problems they faced. I t also 
galvanized a comprehensive government response in the f o rm o f a 12-po in t program. The prob lem 
that emerged f r om the analysis as the most serious obstacle to pr iva te sector development-that o f 
trade administration-is 
n ow addressed through a sub-sector SWAp , supported by a mu l t i-donor 
partnership wh ich includes the Bank. 

34. 
Pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion i n infrastructure (PPI) increased but w i t h l im i t e d scope g iven the 
continued lack o f transparency in contracting, par t icu lar ly f o r large-scale transport and tour ism B O T 
activities. The Bank supported several workshops and TA inputs lead ing to the preparation o f a 
Coun try Framework Paper f o r PP I in FY02 . However, i t was on ly towards the end o f the CAS per iod 
that the Govemment requested additional assistance in developing the lega l and regulatory framework 
fo r PPI. The geographical spread o f pr iva te investment has increased f o r small and med ium providers 
o f e lec tr ic i ty and potable water services. The law o n concessions has been drafted and i s scheduled 
fo r adoption in 2005. 

35. 
Management o f Cambodia’s cu l tura l heritage has 
improved, although this remains 
concentrated o n the A n g k o r temple complex w i t h l i t t l e management o r development o f other sites. 
N o comprehensive conservation program has been implemented and cu l tura l tour ism development has 
been pursued p r im a r i l y through large scale wholesale concessions rather than community-based 
activities. There has no t been any IDA assistance f o r cu l tura l heritage management, although I F C 
did support investment in a ho te l in S iem Reap. 

Other CAS outcomes 

Na t iona l capacity fo r poverty monitoring has improved somewhat but poverty data remains 

36. 
underdeveloped. A Pover ty M o n i t o r i n g and Analysis Technical Unit was established w i t h UNDP 
support in the Ministry o f Planning, but the tra in ing o f ind iv idua ls under the project large ly fa i led to 
add up to a sustainable improvemen t in ins t i tu t iona l capacity. Cambodia’s first par t ic ipa tory poverty 
assessment was carr ied out in 2001, and a pover ty map, p rov id ing headcount estimates down to the 
commune leve l , was prepared based o n 1997 household survey data. However, the quantity and 
qua l i ty o f basic survey data rema in far short o f what i s needed. The Bank stepped in to prov ide gap- 
filling f inanc ia l and technical support to the UNDP- funded 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey: 
wh i le t h i s i s undoubtedly techn ica l ly superior to the previous surveys, the i n a b i l i t y to compare the 
results (due out in m id-2005) w i t h those obtained in 1993/94, 1997 and 1999 makes i t very hard to 
establish poverty trends. 

37. 
The launch o f the Na t iona l Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy (NPRS 2003-05) in 2003, combined 
w i t h the comp le t ion o f Cambodia’s f i rs t MDG report in 2003, p rov ided a framework and i n i t i a l 
impetus f o r better linking development assistance to development outcomes. Assistance prov ided b y 
the Bank Coun try Team to central and l i n e m in is tr ies in the preparation o f the NPRS-including 
assistance w i t h in tegra t ion o f par t ic ipa tory approaches-laid some foundations f o r cross-government 
planning. However, a year o f po l i t ica l deadlock before and f o l l ow i n g the Ju ly 2003 elections meant 
that the imp lemen ta t ion o f re forms l a i d out in the NPRS (requ ir ing the in tegra t ion o f budgetary, 
pub l ic investment, C G and O D A management mechanisms and enhanced capacity in l i n e m i n i s t r i e s ) 
stalled. A change in NPRS leadership as the new Government formed, comb ined w i t h the ro l l -ou t b y 
the new Govemment o f i t s latest v is ion document (the Rectangular Strategy), p rov ided the final b l ow 
to the p r o f i l e and imp lemen ta t ion prospects o f the NPRS.

38. 
Towards the end o f the CAS period, donors who had in earlier years supported parallel 
exercises in med ium- term strategy development or M&E (see paragraph 46 below) made a pub l ic 
commitment to prov ide support to one national strategy process and document. The Government in 
December 2004 launched the process fo r the preparation o f the new five-year Na t iona l Strategic 
Development Plan (NSDP 2006-2010). In Ma rch 2005, the Ministry o f Planning created a new TWG 
to coordinate in ter-M in is ter ia l and Government-donor in terac t ion during NSDP preparation. 

D. BANK PERFORMANCE 

39. 
Under the CAS, de l ivery o f outputs (lending and non- lend ing support) was broad ly achieved, 
albeit w i t h slippages occurr ing in each year. Outputs were generally o f good qua l i ty and achieved the 
relevant anticipated CAS results. The Bank was also responsive t o c l ien t needs b y de l iver ing non- 
programmed services. However, the Bank did no t pe r fo rm very w e l l in the areas o f partnership and 
o u t r e a c h 4 e s p i t e a very good CAS consultation process. This reflected, in large part, the failure to 
anticipate the resources required b y the f i e l d o f f ice to support these activities w h i c h was no t 
s ign i f ican t ly expanded until the end o f the CAS period. These deficiencies were re f lec ted in the 
d i f f i c u l t process o f developing and generating support f o r the NPRS, d i f f icu l t ies wh ich m irrored 
problems o f donor coordination and poor understanding o f the PRSP agenda amongst the 
Government, donors, NGOs and the media in Cambodia. This-and 
other aspects o f the CAS in 
wh ich partnerships were d i f f i c u l t to build o r sustain-reflects 
in large part the inadequate f i e l d 
presence o f the Bank during the first few years o f the C A S period. Over the last tw o years, however, 
staff strength has increased f r om 2 to 28. 

Por t fo l io p e l f o m n c e 

40. 
The Government implemented the reforms needed to keep Cambodia in the base case 
scenario o f US$270 m i l l i o n over the four year period. Fourteen o f f i f teen new projects programmed 
in the CAS were delivered, though several slipped between years, and some slipped ou t o f the i n i t i a l 
CAS pe r iod i n t o FY04. Four out o f f i v e projects w h i c h had qua l i ty at entry reviews were rated 
satisfactory. The active p o r t f o l i o grew f r om 10 t o 18 projects, and f r om US$245 to US$364 m i l l ion , 
supporting a sectorally and geographically diverse range o f activities. Po r t fo l io performance was 
generally good in terms o f disbursement rate, but a number o f generic issues-lack 
o f transparency 
and s low and cumbersome procurement, weak f inanc ia l management, delayed p rov is ion o f 
counterpart funds and weak evaluation and mon i to r ing systems-threaten p o r t f o l i o quality. Towards 
the end o f the C A S pe r iod the po r t fo l io contained as many as fou r p rob lem projects (accounting f o r 15 
percent o f the por t fo l io) , ma in ly in " d i f f i c u l t " sectors (forestry and demobilization). T o address these 
issues at the coun try level, the Bank Group has completed an Integrated F iduc iary Assessment and 
Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iew (IFAPER) and a Coun t ry Procurement Assessment Repor t (CPAR). 
Quarterly p o r t f o l i o mon i to r ing was in i t ia ted w i t h the Government and a j o i n t po r t fo l io strengthening 
program iden t i f ied w i t h ADB (although imp lemen ta t ion o f the latter was delayed). 

41. 
An ambitious program o f 18 AAA products was delivered, inc lud ing several h igh -p ro f i le 
studies and strategic documents (e.g., support f o r the Governance A c t i o n Plan and the Integrated 
Framework f o r Trade). Cross-sectoral country team support was prov ided to the preparation o f 
Cambodia's I-PRSP and NPRS, the Joint S ta f f Assessment, the IFAPER, and in support o f the Bank 's 
ro le as co-chair o f C G meetings. IDA, M P D F and I F C wo rked closely to develop a program f o r PSD 
inc lud ing assistance to banks and S M E s (MPDF) and fac i l i ta t ion o f the Private Sector F o r um (IFC). 
The Bank also supported the Integrated Framework studies wh ich led to Cambodia's WTO accession 
and delivered a detailed assessment o f the constraints to enhanced competitiveness and investment, 
which-as w i t h the I F A P E R - e v o l v e d d i rec t ly i n t o a government r e f o rm program and mu l t i -dono r 
support program. The Bank has also supported an imp roved framework f o r pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in 
infrastructure. 

- 62 - 

42. 
U t i l i z a t i o n o f trust fpnds (wh ich amounted to US$11 m i l l i o n b y the end o f the CAS period) 
was constrained b y l im i t e d knowledge and understanding o f trust fund opportunities w i t h i n the 
Government and amongst project counterparts. O n l y 4 o f the 14 new operations had forma l co- 
f inanc ing or para l le l financing arrangements, further limiting resource mob i l iza t ion . 

43. 
The Bank demonstrated an ab i l i ty to respond to urgent needs and unforeseen opportunities: 
f o r example, b y p rov id ing emergency assistance f o r rebu i ld ing flood-damaged infrastructure in 2000 
(v ia a supplemental Social Fund credit and a stand-alone F l o o d Emergency Rehab i l i ta t ion Project 
credit), and by assisting Cambodia’s accession to WTO w i t h technical support under the Integrated 
Framework and WBI seminars. 

Consultation, outreach and a id coordination 

44. 
The preparation o f the CAS inc luded several consultations w i t h the key stakeholders and an 
inven tory o f development issues as v iewed b y communities. Commun i ty- leve l consultation during 
imp lemen ta t ion invo lved three commun i ty-dr iven development projects wh ich worked o n the basis o f 
loca l demand3. 

45. 
I t i s impor tan t to h igh l igh t that the Bank’s engagement in forestry and demob i l iza t ion d id 
invo lve consultation among key stakeholders even be fore the iden t i f ica t ion o f projects. However, the 
Bank did no t anticipate a need f o r a systematic approach to engaging c i v i l society. In retrospect, this 
m igh t have fac i l i ta ted broader understanding o f the Bank’s position4. At least tw o projects d id 
demonstrate satisfactory consultative process f r om the design stages. In LM A P , the Bank and the 
imp lemen t ing Ministry consciously inc luded NGOs and commun i ty representatives in the preparation 
o f the project i t s e l f . A s i m i l a r e f fo r t was made in the education project (EQIP) and in the preparation 
o f NPRS. O n the other hand, several other Bank in i t ia t ives during the CAS per iod cou ld not generate 
su f f ic ien t par t ic ipa t ion f r om key stakeholders. 

46. 
Despite the recogn i t ion in the CAS o f the importance o f b u i l d i n g partnerships, resources 
devoted to this were grossly inadequate until late in the CAS period. The CAS noted that Cambodia 
was no t a C D F country, but i t did emphasize the impor tan t r o l e o f the Bank in strengthening donor 
coord ina t ion and encouraging partnerships. However , this emphasis was no t reflected in the results 
framework through specific mon i to r ing indicators, and the CAS document, wh i le discussing SWAPS 
extensively, made scant reference to the process o f developing the PRSP framework f o r development 
assistance, despite the fact that the I-PRSP and PRSP were b o t h deliverables under the CAS program. 
CGs in Paris, Tokyo, and Phnom Penh were e f fec t ive forums f o r exchange o f views between the 
Government and donors and prov ided the basis f o r focusing the r e f o rm agenda and establishing 
wo rk ing groups to ma in ta in dialogue between the annual C G meetings. However, w i t h the exception 
o f a j o i n t po r t fo l io strengthening program w i t h the Government and ADB, and support f o r the dra f t ing 
o f the I-PRSP and W R S , t h i s “architecture” was no t supported w i t h on-going support to the 
Government to develop mechanisms f o r improved O D A management until later in the C A S period, 
when the Bank prov ided strong support to the development o f a government-led Harmon iza t ion and 
A l ignmen t r e f o rm agenda. The Bank has also been active in the TWGs o f those sectors in wh ich i t 
participates; has participated, w i t h ADB, DFID and (towards the end) the UN system, i n a j o i n t 
country strategy preparation process; and has begun t o develop, w i t h ADB, an agreement w i t h Japan 
on the coord ina t ion o f large-scale f inanc ia l assistance. 

These development projects were: the Soc ia l Fund, Northeast V i l lage Deve lopmen t and Educa t ion Qua l i ty 
Improvement. Other projects have engaged l o c a l commun i t ies on a less systematic basis. 
A l though systematic engagement o f c i v i l society was n o t anticipated in the design o f the demob i l iza t ion 
project, such consu l ta t ion did develop once the pro jec t started. Th is consultation, and the structured 
inc lus ion o f c i v i l society in the pro jec t mon i to r ing process, were ins trumen ta l in he lp ing the Bank t o 
understand and s ta r t addressing the prob lems that emerged. The broader conc lus ion - that there was 
untapped po ten t ia l t o imp rove the effectiveness o f aid de l ive ry (and service de l ive ry more broad ly) b y 
p rov id ing a larger r o l e f o r c i v i l society - has been an impo r tan t lesson learned dur ing thus C A S per iod . 

- 63 - 

47. 

Outreach was another area in wh ich performance was unsatisfactory in the early years of the 
per iod under rev iew (despite high quality consultations carr ied out during the preparation o f the 
CAS), but imp roved towards the end. The fa i lure to develop a systematic approach f o r outreach to 
NGOs, the pr iva te sector and the media resulted in l im i t e d understanding o f the Bank’s activities and 
l im i t e d trust in the Bank’s motives, due in large part to a partial or incorrect understanding o f the 
Bank’s pos i t ion and ro le in the re fo rm process. A lack o f deliberate e f for ts at engagement w i t h these 
groups was in sharp contrast to the Bank’s perceived close relationship w i t h a Government wh ich 
many in c i v i l society v iewed as inherently corrupt and more o f ten part o f the p rob lem than the 
solution to Cambodia’s challenges. As a result, in the most d i f f i c u l t areas o f p o l i c y re form , the Bank 
soon came t o be perceived as the impediment to progress b y NGOs (in forestry), the pr iva te sector (on 
the L aw on Investment) and the media (in regard to demobilization). Over the last one to tw o years, 
however, the practical constraints on outreach have been gradually addressed as the Coun try O f f ice 
has expanded. A l l reports are n ow produced in b o t h Khmer and English and a much larger volume o f 
in fo rma t ion on Bank projects and policies i s now available on the website. The Pub l ic In forma t ion 
Center (PIC) receives some 300 visitors per month. 

48. 

The l im i ta t ions in partnership and outreach were clearly seen in the NPRS preparation 
process. The I-PRSP, prepared b y the M i n i s t r y o f Economy and Finance, was v iewed as a good 
document but w i t h very l im i t e d l i n e m in is t ry engagement. Preparation o f the Second F ive-Year Plan 
(SEDP2) more or less concurrently w i t h preparation o f the full NPRS gave r ise to a broad consensus 
amongst donors and NGO s that the Bank and IMF were impos ing another strategy document on 
Cambodia. A l though i t was agreed w i t h the Government and ADB (wh ich supported SEDP2 
preparation) that the PRSP w o u l d become the implementation p lan f o r SEDP2, in fact the two 
documents lacked complementarity, re f lec t ing the l im i t e d in terna l iza t ion o f the SEDP2 strategies in 
the Government and the fa i lure o f the tw o lead donors to coordinate the overa l l strategy processes5. 
This situation was aggravated b y UNDP ’s subsequent focus on MDGs, elaborated outside b o t h the 
SEDP2 and NPRS frameworks. G iven this context, and concerns that the NPRS w o u l d b e a Bank- 
IMF document, the Bank decided to take a less direct supporting ro le and worked closely w i t h other 
donors and some NGOs to support a government-led process. W h i l e there i s s t i l l c r i t i c i sm o f the 
preparation process, the Government’s leadership was f i rm l y established and most donors, inc lud ing 
the more skeptical ones, began ac t ive ly supporting the NPRS as a framework f o r enhanced donor 
coordination-until, 
as described above, the elections, po l i t ica l impasse and launch o f the Rectangular 
Strategy rendered i t increasingly irrelevant. 

49. 

The preparation o f the new Na t iona l Strategic Development P lan provides an oppor tun i ty to 
improve on the practices associated w i t h the SEDP2 and NPRS (and the Cambodian Millennium 
Development Goals Report o f 2003). B o t h donors and the Government have p u b l i c l y stated that there 
w i l l be just one national document f o r the 2006-2010 period, and have started to pu t in place the 
ins t i tu t iona l arrangements to make this possible. 

Ove ra l l assessment of the pe$ormance of the CAS 

50. 

Performance under the CAS b y the end o f FY03 re f lec ted de l ivery o f outputs and 
achievement o f results broad ly as anticipated, bu t w i t h very l im i t e d impac t o n Cambodia’s 
development outcomes, inc lud ing pover ty reduction. Task teams e f fec t ive ly delivered the agreed 
program, albeit w i t h some s ign i f ican t delays, w i t h generally good qua l i ty . M o s t self-evaluation 
results indicators were thus met. However, Cambodia’s very l im i t e d progress towards expected 
outcomes in tw o o f the three pillars o f the C A S (governance and pr iva te sector environment), together 
w i t h poor performance in reduc ing pover ty despite re la t ive ly high growth, suggest either 
shortcomings in the assessment o f the enabling environment, and/or poo r design or imp lemen ta t ion o f 
key aspects o f the program. 

The process o f NPRS preparation and i t s relationship to SEDP2 i s reviewed in detail in an OED assessment, 
conducted as a country case study in a rev iew o f experiences w i th PRSP formulation. This assessment 
was finalized in July 2004. 

- 64 - 

51. 
In attempting to iden t i fy the key factors that l im i t e d progress towards CAS outcomes, the 
Coun try Team has iden t i f ied weaknesses in the development assistance framework, and weaknesses 
in the governance framework. These two key limiting factors iden t i f ied b y the country team in the 
CAS Comp le t ion Report were clearly iden t i f ied in the CAS . However, ambitious plans to build donor 
partnerships through sectoral approaches and to continue outreach activities in i t ia ted during CAS 
consultations were no t backed up w i t h adequate resources until late i n the CAS period. These plans- 
and associated CAS resource a l loca t ions -ce r ta in ly did no t adequately anticipate the demands o f 
supporting a PRSP process. Outcomes and results in and constraints to private sector development 
were c lear ly specified in the CAS, but w i t h l im i t e d l inkage to sectoral activities and w i t h results 
indicators de f ined based on sector-specific rather than cross-cutting approaches, even though the 
issues iden t i f ied affected a l l sectors. 

52. 
G iven the weak overall governance environment in Cambodia, the k e y determinant o f 
sustainability i s the demand f o r CAS-supported outcomes amongst k e y stakeholder groups. Po l i t ica l 
w i l l f o r r e f o rm i s l im i t e d g iven the strength o f vested interests w i t h i n and outside the Government. 
Broader-based demand f o r reforms i s required as a complementary force to dr ive and sustain the 
r e f o rm process, and to ensure the maintenance o f service provision. The ab i l i ty o f c i v i l society to 
e f fec t ive ly demand and mon i tor the qua l i ty and quantity o f services f r om the Government i s limited 
(re f lec t ing the legacy o f th i r ty years o f continued po l i t ica l violence), but growing, and needs to be 
supported. 

53. 
The p r ima ry analytical gap recognized b y the country team in ex-post assessment was better 
analysis o f h ow governance problems manifest themselves in the po l icy development and 
imp lemen ta t ion processes, inc lud ing in the context o f Bank- funded projects. In a pos t-con f l ic t society 
such as this, the Bank ’s ab i l i ty to influence results o n the ground requires that i t s l im i t e d resources be 
focused where there i s the po l i t ica l w i l l and ab i l i ty to imp lemen t re form . Poverty analysis, too, cou ld 
have been stronger during the CAS period. A l though there were significant weaknesses in 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the 1999 household survey, l i t t l e e f fo r t was made during the CAS per iod to extract 
in fo rma t ion t o assist in understanding household status, and n o supplementary poverty analysis was 
carried out. F ina l ly , gaps in the analytical process were as impor tan t as gaps in analysis. With the 
exception o f the Integrated Framework f o r Trade, the IFAPER and the investment/private sector 
development assessment, analytical wo rk was no t carr ied out in a f u l l y par t ic ipa tory manner wh ich 
l im i t e d opportunities to build broader consensus around k e y reforms and activities. 

54. 
Extemal factors wh ich l im i t e d rea l progress inc luded h i g h l y centralized decision-makmg 
processes and l im i t e d h igh- leve l commitment to reforms in troduced by Bank lend ing or AAA. L o w 
c i v i l servant s a l a r i e s prov ide l i t t l e incentive to innovate or overcome ins t i tu t iona l or po l i t ica l 
impediments. Capacity constraints, par t icu lar ly in terms o f empowerment o f lowe r leve l and sub- 
na t iona l government staff, limit the ab i l i ty o f projects to catalyze broader change w i thou t direct buy- 
in f r om the highest levels, wh i le systemic, centralized corrup t ion creates incentives t o resist changes 
in troduced b y new po l ic ies o r projects.

Zntemal factors wh ich l im i t e d progress inc luded insu f f ic ien t f i e l d support f o r the partnership

The rev iew o f the last CAS provides several overa l l conclusions: 
service de l ivery and investment climate- 
were appropriate and rema in so today. However, de l ivery o f program outputs did no t lead to 
the broader impac t anticipated in the CAS-as

implementation o f new laws, po l ic ies and strategies, and b y the l im i t e d catalytic effect o f 
project approaches o n overa l l service delivery. 
. The pr imary impediment to greater impact was 
the poor governance environment, 
characterized b y the capacity o f vested interests to b lock reforms operating through a poo r ly 
paid, patronage-based c i v i l service system, weak lega l protections f o r the poor, and a pr iva te 
sector characterized b y h i g h levels o f bureaucratic in terven t ion and uno f f ic ia l charges. 
. Poor donor coordination accentuated the problems o f weak govemance b y : p rov id ing 
con f l ic t ing messages to the Government; preventing the sharing o f experiences f o r scaling up; 
impos ing high transactions costs f o r a l l stakeholders; and f a i l i n g to build effective 
constituencies f o r most challenging reforms. 

A stronger country team approach was needed to better u t i l ize the CAS document as a t o o l f o r 
mon i to r ing progress. The large number o f self-evaluation indicators and outcome areas 
discouraged cross-sectoral approaches in support o f the three pillars o f the CAS. 

A lack o f selectivity in the Bank's program resulted in too broad a spread o f analytical and 
investment activities, w i t h reliance on a high number o f L I L s . These characteristics o f the 
Bank program made i t harder to manage, and imposed h i g h transactions costs o n the 
Government. 
A number o f lessons learned emerge that are o f value f o r formu la t ion o f the new CAS: 
. The need to focus directly and consistently on govemance as the overa l l cross-cutting theme 
throughout the coun try program, i f Bank activities are to have greater impac t o n results. The 
need to focus on governance i s re in forced b y the Roya l Government's ow n analysis and 
statements (it i s , f o r example, at the core o f the Rectangular Strategy). 
I t i s impor tan t to 
recognize that governance re forms inev i tab ly take longer than anticipated, g iven resistance to 
change by vested interests w i t h i n and outside government. "Demand side" approaches to good 
governance (building broad constituencies f o r r e f o rm through outreach to c i v i l society and the 
pr iva te sector, e.g., through the p rov is ion o f in fo rma t ion and organizational tools) are an 
essential complement to mo re common "supply side" approaches to good governance, and 
one that the W o r l d Bank Group needs t o strengthen in future. 
. The need to improve donor coordination and partnerships. Poor donor coord ina t ion and 
inadequate outreach to c i v i l society have accentuated the problems o f weak governance and 
contributed to l o w levels o f a id effectiveness. A serious commitment t o wo rk ing in a 
partnership-focused approach requires a much larger field presence. The CAS consultation 
process should prov ide the basis f o r continued consultations rather than b e focused o n the

Env i ronmen ta l Sustainability in Cambodia 

State o f the Environment 

1. 
Cambodia’s economy depends heav i ly on agriculture, fisheries, and na tura l resources. 
The ag r icu l tu ra l sector accounts fo r a third o f GDP, but reliance on na tura l resources i s even 
h igher in r u r a l areas, where they p rov ide fo r much d irec t household consumption, and serve as a 
safety ne t when other sources fa i l . A lmos t a l l ru ra l people engage in some fish harvesting, and 82 
percent o f na t iona l energy consumption measured in 1995 was in the f o rm o f fuel wood. The 
unique eco-system centered on the Ton le Sap Bas in supports a fishing indus try wh ich alone 
prov ides an estimated 40-70 percent o f Cambodia’s p ro te in in take and 5 percent o f GDP, and 
upon wh ich approximately 1.7 m i l l i o n people (14 percent o f the to ta l population) depend. 

2. 
Env i ronmen ta l pressures have been exacerbated b y the high popu la t ion g row th rate (2.8 
percent over the last two decades), ow ing pa r t ly to the baby boom that fo l lowed the Khmer rouge 
era. These pressures have led to a h igher demand f o r na tura l resources, especially land. I f 
imp rope r ly managed, widespread land grabbing i s l i k e l y w i t h severe impacts on poor and 
vulnerable groups. Rap id urbanization has also put increasing pressure on the mun ic ipa l i t ies , 
w h i c h have to manage bo th so l id waste and wastewater generated b y residents. Furthermore, 
transboundary issues invo lv ing i l lega l logg ing and w i l d l i f e trade are also o n the r ise despite the 
agreement in 2001 among Cambodia, L a o PDR, and V ie tnam to promo te in terna t iona l 
cooperation in environmental protection.

The importance o f na tura l resources and environmental management in Cambodia has 
been recognized in the fo l low ing key na t iona l po l ic ies and leg is la t ion : (i) Na t iona l Env ironmen ta l 
A c t i o n P lan (NEAP ) cover ing the pe r iod f r om 1998-2002; (ii) Second F i v e Year Socio-Economic 
Development P lan (2001-2005); (iii) L a n d and Forest Policies; ( iv ) Roya l Decree o n the Creation 
and Des igna t ion o f Protected Areas, 1993; (v) Env ironmen ta l Pro tec t ion and Na tu ra l Resources 
Management A c t 1996; (v i ) Sub-decree on Water Po l lu t ion Con tro l , 1999; (v i i ) Sub-decree on 
So l id Waste Management, 1999; (v i i i ) Sub-decree o n Env ironmen ta l Impac t Assessment, 1999; 
and ( ix ) Sub-decree on Air Po l lu t ion and No ise Disturbance Control, 2000. 

5. 

Ye t environmental management in Cambodia remains weak. The lega l framework fo r 
environmental management does no t yet fully meet the country's needs, and prac t ica l 
imp lemen ta t ion measures inc lud ing coordination and enforcement l a g behind. A l though many 
env ironmen ta l ly unsustainable forest concessions have been cancelled, i l lega l logg ing and land 
grabbing continues. In fo rma t ion and sector guidelines are lack ing on c ruc ia l aspects such as 
a l lowab le forestry cut, fish yields, and groundwater resources. The roles and responsibilities o f 
the environmental agencies at various levels need t o be c lar i f ied ; as many as 14 agencies are 
invo lved in the management o f the Ton le Sap Basin. Management capacities are par t icu lar ly 
weak at loca l levels, fo rc ing many environmental management decisions to be made centrally. 
A l though 20 percent o f ru ra l cash incomes der ive f r om common access resources, poor 
stakeholder par t ic ipa t ion weakens community-based management. The Government has released 
many pr iva te fishing concessions in the Ton le Sap to communities, but the regu la tory framework 
and loca l capacity fo r management are insu f f ic ien t ly developed.

Decreasing Forest Cover. Forestry has made a re la t ive ly sma l l con t r ibu t ion to bo th 
na t iona l revenue and to GDP, n o t exceeding 4 percent and 8 percent respectively since 
1994. A l though g row th in other sectors o f the economy have con tr ibu ted to the decline o f 
forestry growth, the f a l l in logg ing revenues and increase in the vo lume o f timber 
extracted during the 1990s are more a consequence o f weak governance. The 
Government responded w i t h a crack-down on i l lega l loggers and sawmills, and closed 
many commerc ia l forest concessions, but longer- term comm i tmen ts are s t i l l needed. 

Pressures f r o m various factors contribute to the loss o f forest cover in Cambodia: (i) 
many forms o f land concessions; (ii) popu la t ion g row th and increasing demand fo r land; 
(iii) unsustainable types o f agriculture; ( iv ) encroachment o n seasonally forest, wetland, 
and protected areas; and (v) impac t f r om development ac t iv i t ies e.g., mining and quarries 
fo r construction and extraction. 

0 Waste and Wastewater Management. U rban popu la t ion g row th has averaged 3.5 
percent per annum in the last t w o decades. In 2002, rough ly 800 tons o f so l id waste were 
collected every day in Phnom Penh, the largest c i t y in Cambod ia w i t h over 2 m i l l i o n 
people. I t has been estimated that a l i t t l e over 80 percent o f a l l so l id waste i s collected 
and disposed o f w i t h i n Phnom Penh. This ra t io drops s ign i f ican t ly in other ma jor cities. 
Sewage and wastewater treatment and disposal are unable t o meet the g row ing popu la t ion 
needs. I n Phnom Penh, the sewerage system has no t been ma in ta ined f o r more than three 
decades and 80 percent o f sewers are b locked o r severely damaged. Sewerage coverage i s 
on ly about 10 percent, and o f the 194 factories in the c i t y assessed in 2000, on ly e igh t 
had on-site p r ima ry treatment and their e f f luen ts generally exceeded Cambodia's water 
qua l i ty standards. During the d ry season, untreated sewage i s d i rec t ly discharged in to 

- 93 - 

rivers, and during the wet season a m ix tu re o f sewage and s torm water backs up in to 
houses in l ow - l y i n g areas, pos ing s ign i f ican t hea l th r i s k s . 

In land Fisheries and Coastal Resources Degradation. Cambodia has the fou r th largest 
freshwater f ishery in the world, after China, Ind ia and Bangladesh. This i s remarkable 
g iven Cambodia’s popu la t ion re la t ive to these countries, and i s possible large ly due to the 
p roduc t iv i ty o f the Ton le Sap Basin. O f f i c i a l figures record an increase in freshwater fish 
catches since 1980, but true trends are d i f f i c u l t to determine g iven that much small-scale 
freshwater f ish ing does no t appear in na t iona l statistics. Popu la t ion growth, especially in 
the Ton le Sap basin where around 40 percent o f households are d irec t ly dependent on 
fishing, suggests that the r i s e in fishing e f for ts may have outstripped the g row th in 
catches over recent years. The marine fish catch has dec l ined f r om a h i g h o f 40 to 36 
b i l l i o n tons between 1990 and 2000. The i l lega l use o f destructive fishing tools and 
methods has undermined the long - te rm sustainability o f fish and marine resources. This 
w i l l have adverse imp l ica t ions on the l ive l ihoods o f people whose da i ly consumption and 
cash income depend on these resources. 

Poor Protection of Biodiversity and Protected Areas. Cambodia has one o f the highest 
protected area coverages in the reg ion (18.3 percent), but insu f f ic ien t resources have been 
allocated t o the responsible agencies at the na t iona l and loca l levels to carry out the ir 
duties. There are many settlements w i t h i n and around protected areas, and over- 
exp lo i ta t ion o f forest resources i s common. Protected areas are no rma l ly surrounded b y 
forest and other land concessions, mak ing i t very d i f f i c u l t t o ensure protection. Few 
protected areas are pa tro l led on any consistent basis, and ongo ing surveys and trade 
research revea l that w i l d l i f e populations are being poached at an a larm ing rate. 

Recently, the Government established a protected forest system f o r conservation o f 
w i l d l i f e and forest cover ing 1.03 m i l l i o n ha. These protected forests are under the 
ju r isd ic t ion o f the M i n i s t r y o f Ag r icu l tu re Fores try and Fisheries, whereas other protected 
areas are under the respons ib i l i ty o f the M i n i s t r y o f Env ironmen t . I t remains to be seen 
h ow the t w o agencies w i l l coordinate and wo rk together to strengthen their pro tec t ion 
e f for ts . 

Weak Environmental Znstitutions and Instruments. The Government has put in p lace 
many fo rwa rd - look ing environment legislations and po l ic ies , but inadequate resources, 
inc lud ing human, financial, and phys ica l resources have been allocated t o imp lemen ta t ion 
and enforcement. In 2001, M O E received a budget o f on ly U S $ 1.25 m i l l i o n o r about 0.3 
percent o f to ta l government expenditure. I t i s c r i t ica l that innova t ive sustainable 
f inanc ing o f env ironmen ta l pro tec t ion be iden t i f ied . Payment fo r eco log ica l services 
might p rov ide a v iab le op t ion fo r the Government to consider. 

In add i t ion t o resources, better env ironmen ta l governance needs to be p rov ided in t e rm s 
o f clearer mandates and guidelines f o r imp lemen ta t ion o f new legislation, and 
coord ina t ion between management agencies. The existence o f numerous agencies 
invo lved in the management o f the Ton le Sap Bas in and the d iv is ion o f protected area 
management between tw o separate m in is tr ies are examples o f overlapping jur isd ic t ions . 
C la r i f ica t ion o f respons ib i l i t ies and transparency in management transactions w i l l ensure 
proper accoun tab i l i ty and reduce the incidence o f abuses. Appropr ia te regu la tory 
frameworks at the loca l leve l are also needed to address na t iona l- leve l po l ic ies and

Cambodia has a considerable na tura l resource base that has the po ten t ia l to p rov ide 
sustainable benefits to the poor . Since the Cambodian economy depends heav i ly on na tura l 
resources, economic g row th and pover ty reduc t ion can be s ign i f ican t ly undermined b y the ir over- 
exp lo i ta t ion and degradation. The CAS c lear ly recognizes the importance o f NRM and the key 
linkages between na tura l assets and pover ty reduction. Objective 2 o f the f i rs t CAS P i l la r 
spec i f ica l ly supports the improvement of 
transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the governance of 
na tu ra l resources, ensuring security of access to land fo r smallholders and supporting 
improvements in state land management. The expected outcomes and the proposed instruments 
supporting the CAS objectives are l is ted in Tab le 2.

Declaration by the 
Royal Government of Cambodia and Development Partners 
on Harmonization and Alignment 

Introduction 

The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) and Cambodia's development partners declare 
their willingness to create an effective development partnership based on mutual commitment, 
trust, respect and confidence. We do so in the interests of the people of Cambodia-aiming 
to 
reduce poverty, improve our collaboration and sustain development gains towards achieving 
Cambodia's Millennium Development Goals. The objective of this Declaration is to enhance aid 
effectiveness through harmonization and alignment of donor and RGC practices and procedures 
to achieve quality outcomes and greater development impact. 

The spirit of this understanding follows from the Royal Government of Cambodia 's statement at 
the Fourth Consultative Group (CG) Meeting, A New Development Cooperation Partnership 
Paradigm for Cambodia (May 2000), the work of the OECDl DAC, the resolutions of the 
Monterrey Consensus (March 2002), and the Rome Declaration on Harmonization (February 
2003). This Declaration has been developed following discussions and exchanges at four 
Harmonization and Alignment Workshops held in Cambodia during January - October 2004 to 
implement the Rome Declaration's commitments. 

We the Royal Government and the development partners of Cambodia are committed to the 
Rome Declaration on Harmonization and through this Declaration express our willingness to 
support the following: 

Rome Declaration #I : Ensuring that development assistance is delivered in accordance with 
partner country priorities, including poverty reduction strategies and similar approaches, and 
that harmonization efforts are adapted to the country context. 

In Cambodia, we will align our programs to existing government strategies such as the 
Rectangular Strategy (RS), the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NRSP) and the Socio- 
Economic Development Plan I1 (SEDPII), and we will work together to help the government 
produce an integrated National Strategic Development Plan NSDP (2006-2010). 

Rome Declaration #2: Reviewing and identifying ways to amend, as appropriate, our individual 
institutions' and countries' policies, procedures and practices to facilitate harmonization. 
In 
addition, we will work 
to reduce donor missions, reviews, and reporting, streamline 
conditionalities, and simplify and harmonize documentation. 

In Cambodia, we will turn best practice in the following areas into common practice: 
. working towards Sector Wide Approaches where appropriate, and in all cases we will 
harmonize our resources, provision of TA and channels of delivery around one 

- 109 - 

strategy; strengthening the involvement of civil society - as appropriate - to support 
the activities of government and donors in achieving the goals identified by the 
government in its national polices and strategies; 

working to improve the government systems--such as procurement and financial 
management-to international standards so that we can adopt them; and 

Harmonizing, streamlining and simplifying donor requirements 
formula tion/ missiondprojectdworksh op/rep orting etc. 

through joint 

Rome Declaration #3: 

Implementing progressively-building on experiences so far and the 
messages from the regional workshops-the 
good practice standards or principles in 
development assistance delivery and management, taking into account specific country 
circumstances. We will disseminate the good practices to our managers and staff at 
headquarters and in country offices and to other in-country development partners. 

In Cambodia, we will produce a Partnership Report every six months for the Consultative 
Group meeting and the mid-CG Meeting. These reports will take stock of progress and will 
enable government and donors to share emerging good practices with the donors’ 
headquarters and with the international community. 

Rome Declaration #4: Intensifying donor efforts to work through delegated cooperation at the 
country level and increasing the flexibility of country based staff to manage country programs 
and projects more effectively and efficiently. 

In Cambodia, we will encourage all development partners to look at ways to provide 
assistance through delegated cooperation -- especially those donors without an in-country 
presence. 

Rome Declaration #5: Developing, at all levels within our organizations, incentives that foster 
management and staff recognition of the benefits of harmonization in the interest of increased 
aid effectiveness. 

In Cambodia, this will mean that increasingly we will recognize and reward results achieved 
through collaboration rather than the number of inputs. 

Rome Declaration #6: Providing support for country analytic work in ways that will strengthen 
government’s ability to assume a greater leadership role and take ownership of development 
results. In particular, we will work with partner governments to forge stronger partnerships and 
will collaborate to improve the policy relevance, quality, delivery, and efficiency of country 
analytic work. 

In Cambodia, we will make efforts to have all analytic work carried out in harmony with the 
relevant sectoral TWG, fhereby avoiding duplication, and achieving government ownership 
and building government capacity. Furthermore, both the RGC and donors recognize the 
importance of civil society in undertaking policy research and dialogue. Donors will support 
the government in fulfilling its responsibilities to undertake open, inclusive and respectful 
consultations with Cambodian civil society when undertaking studies or developing policies. 

- 110- 

Rome Declaration #7: Expanding or mainstreaming country-led efforts (whether begun in 
particular sectors, thematic areas, or individual projects) to streamline donor procedures and 
practices, including enhancing demand-driven technical cooperation. 

In Cambodia, this will mean that we will make efforts to provide Technical Assistance 
necessary for meeting capacity development needs identified at the sector/program level 
and within the framework o f the relevant sectoral TWG -- and where appropriate, in the 
context o f a Sector Wide Approach-so as to move towards more integrated and demand- 
driven technical assistance and more sustainable capacity. 

Rome Declaration #8: Providing budget sector, or balance of payments support where it is 
consistent with the mandate of the donor, and when appropriate policy and fiduciary 
arrangements are in place. Good practice principles or standards-including alignment with 
national budget cycles and national poverty reduction strategy reviews-should be used in 
delivering such assistance. 

In Cambodia, in addition to the actions spelled out in point 8, we will make efforts to provide 
full information to RGC on ODA flows (including contributions to NGOs) in a timely manner, 
to enable integration into budget cycle, improve predictability o f resources, provide more 
medium-term indication of donor support to Cambodia, in the context of the Medium Term 
Expenditure Framework. 

Rome Declaration #9: Promoting harmonized approaches in global and regional programs. 

In Cambodia, we will aim to do this in the context o f the Mekong River Commission, GMS, 
ASEAN and other regional fora. 

THE WAY FORWARD 

We, the Royal Government and the development partners of Cambodia express our willingness 
to implement the RGC’s National Action Plan on Harmonization and Alignment and to monitor 
progress in implementing the Plan, which will be reported through the Consultative Group 
process twice a year. 

On its part the Royal Government of Cambodia will undertake the necessary reforms to 
enhance transparency and accountability especially in the areas of procurement, financial 
management and reduction of corruption. 

We, the development partners will aim to make the planning and delivery of our assistance 
more transparent so that we can increase the accountability of all development actors and to 
improve aid effectiveness to maximize its benefits for the Cambodian people.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2. 

Cambod ia i s among the world’s least developed countries as a result o f decades o f conflict, 
in te rna t iona l embargo, and post-war population growth. T o address deep, mu l t i-d imens iona l poverty, 
p r iva te sector g row th i s needed to p rov ide economic opportunity, to deliver pub l ic services, and to 
p rov ide the revenue base needed to ensure sustainable development. 

T h e legacy o f conflict. Decades o f war, ru inous po l ic ies and embargo destroyed the ins t i tu t iona l 
fabr ic o f c i v i l society and commerce, as w e l l as the human talent on wh ich entrepreneurship i s based. 
Wa r and embargo disrupted the development o f social ins t i tu t ions and fo rma l and in fo rma l rules that 
p rov ide the f ramewo rk f o r trade and investment. 

N a r r o w g row th based on a n extremely small fo rma l p r iva te sector. The ma jo r i ty o f the 
popu la t ion i s rural, and linked to subsistence agriculture, wh ich has g rown at less than 2 percent per 
year over the past ten years. An estimated 80 percent o f fam i l ies headed b y someone emp loyed in 
agr icu l ture are poor . Acco rd ing t o Cambodia’s Labo r Force Survey, the manu fac tur ing sector 
employs less than n ine percent o f the workforce, compared w i t h over 70 percent in agriculture, 
forestry, and fisheries. A large share o f the p r iva te sector operates in fo rma l ly , con t r ibu t ing m i n im a l l y 
t o the tax base and fac ing l im i t e d access to f inance and trade. 

Ex t reme dependence on one export sector, a n d substantial risks. The remarkable g row th o f the 
garment sector since 1995 demonstrated the po ten t ia l impac t o f pr iva te sector development o n 
pover ty . Garment sector exports grew f r om US$28 m i l l i o n in 1995 to approximately US$2 b i l l i o n in 
2004, emp loy ing over 270,000 people. B y the end o f 2004, after several years in wh ich the annual 
quota increase was near the 14 percent m a x im um allowed, Cambodia had become one o f the 20 
largest exporters o f garments to the U S market. However , the quota system under wh ich Cambodia’s 
exports f lour ished has g iven way to a h igh ly compe t i t ive marketplace in wh ich Ch ina i s expected t o 
increase i t s market share to 50 percent. Cambodia n ow faces s ign i f ican t risks because i t s garments 
comprise 7 6 percent o f i t s exports and i t produces many o f the same commod i t ies as Ch ina . In the 
Investment C l ima te Survey, on ly 16% o f the sample actually exported. 

- 113 - 

0 Poor infrastructure . Cambodia’s l o w income, l o w popu la t ion density, and h is to ry o f con f l ic t are 
re f lec ted in the poor coverage, qua l i ty and e f f ic iency o f much o f i t s infrastructure. The services that 
ex is t are ma in ly concentrated in urban areas, and the substantial ru ra l popu la t ion suffers f r o m lack o f 
access to markets, unsafe and unre l iab le water supplies, and dependence on t rad i t iona l biomass forms 
o f energy or high-cost alternatives. 

0 Dec l in ing FDI over the past decade. FDI has declined steeply since 1996, when in f lows reached 
near ly US$300 m i l l ion . F D I i n f l ow s fo r 2003 were US$87 m i l l i o n (Wo r ld Deve lopmen t Indicators). 

11. 

THE OPPORTUNITY 

3. 
Past performance provides hope tha t the pr ivate sector w i l l respond robustly to a n 
imp roved investment climate. The fo rma l pr iva te sector, and par t icu lar ly the manu fac tur ing sector, was 
v i r tua l ly non-existent fo l low ing Cambodia’s f i r s t elections in 1993. Indus try cons t i tu ted just 15 percent 
o f output, among the wor ld ’s lowest. The 1995 Survey o f Establishments ind ica ted that on ly 829 
businesses in Cambodia employed 10 o r more employees, and garment exports were US$26 m i l l i o n . The 
Government responded t o the challenge o f peace b y embracing the market, open ing the economy to 
p r iva te and fore ign investment by d isman t l ing much o f the central p lann ing and state-trading 
infrastructure, se l l ing state-owned enterprises, establishing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , l ibe ra l iz ing trade 
and free ing prices. The response f r o m investors was robust. Jo in t ventures and FDI pro jec t commitments 
exceeded US$2 .2 b i l l i o n f r om 1994 to 1996, p r ima r i ly in to garments, cons truc t ion and tourism. Progress 
was ha l ted in 1997, due to a comb ina t ion o f po l i t ica l violence and a lack o f progress in further 
strengthening governance. 

I n a l im i ted numbe r o f sectors, innovat ion and rap id g row th has taken place. As a resu l t o f the 
comb ina t ion o f market oppor tun i ty and evo lv ing lega l environment, Cambodia emerged as a home o f 
some o f the wor ld ’s more innova t ive pr iva te enterprises. Ac leda Bank was one o f the wor ld ’s fastest 
g row ing m icrocred i t institutions, and one o f the f i r s t m icrocred i t ins t i tu t ions to evo lve f r o m NGO to 
full commerc ia l bank license. Ru ra l e lec tr ic i ty enterprises emerged to p rov ide power to ru ra l 
commun i t ies despite the absence o f a na t iona l gr id . H i g h l y innova t ive experiments were undertaken, 
w i t h ADB support, on the outsourcing and in-sourc ing o f pub l ic hea l th services. 

Ga rmen ts sector. The garment sector i s less demanding o f longer- term f i x e d cap i ta l investment, and 
i s therefore more l i k e l y to g row w i thou t a well-developed lega l framework and f inanc ia l market. The 
sector has g rown phenomenally due to pre feren t ia l access to 26 countries (Generalized System o f 
Preferences), and par t icu lar ly favorab le treatment f r om the EU and US . In 1999, Cambodia entered 
i n t o the US-Cambodia Textiles Agreement, wh ich provides fo r a quota on tex t i le and apparel impor ts 
f r o m Cambodia and reduced t a r i f f rates on U S exports to Cambodia. The Agreement created an 
incen t ive to imp rove wo rk ing conditions by p rov id ing fo r an annual increase in quota o f up t o 14 
percent i f labor conditions were found to comp ly w i t h core labor standards embedded in Cambodia’s 
Labo r L aw . Cambodia’s exports to the U S increased b y 200 percent during the first tw o years o f the 
Agreement. B y 2004, Cambodian exports t o the U S alone exceeded US$1.5 b i l l ion . Cambod ia i s 
n ow attempting t o compete in a pos t -MFA environment w i thou t bene f i t o f quota a l loca t ion b y 
pos i t ion ing i tse l f as a destination that protects core labor standards. I t i s rece iv ing techn ica l support 
f r o m the In terna t iona l Labo r Organization’s Be t ter Factories Campaign. A recent FIAS survey 
suggests a pos i t ive market response, but one that i s cond i t iona l o n improvements in cost structure. 

Tour ism . Cambodia i s blessed t o have one o f the seven wonders o f the ancient w o r l d that continues 
to attract visitors f r o m around the wo r ld . Cambodia received 1.06 m i l l i o n tourists in 2004, a 50 
percent increase f r o m SARS-a f fec ted 2003, and peak mon th ly tour is t arr iva ls have increased b y 

- 114 - 

around 20,000 each o f the past tw o years to 120,000, lead ing to a massive ho te l construction boom in 
S iem Reap. A l though there has been a considerable increase in tourist-related construction in the 
S iem Reap area, there i s broad consensus- that the po ten t ia l fo r cu l tu ra l and eco-tourism, as w e l l as 
backward linkages to handicrafts and art, have n o t been tapped. China, whose citizens have increased 
the ir leisure expenditure, i s curren t ly on ly the seventh largest source o f tourists to Cambodia beh ind 
South Korea, Japan, USA, UK, Tha i land and Taiwan. The issue o f creating a sustainable tou r ism 
indus try that w i l l e f fec t ive ly incorporate linkages to the agr icu l ture sector and the preservation o f 
Cambodia's tour is t assets remains a challenge fo r the indus try and the Government.

0 T h e agro- industr ia l sector arguab ly has the highest potent ia l fo r creating broad-based 
employment. Ag r icu l tu ra l output i s substantial, pa r t icu la r ly in r ice and seafood, but a large share 
o f output i s no t commerc ia l ly marketed but sold in fo rma l ly to Tha i land or V ie tnam due to 
fragmented markets and uncompe t i t ive domestic supply chains. Fou r - f i f ths o f the exportable r ice 
crop i s sold as unprocessed paddy. H a l f o f arable land i s underutilized, and 80 percent o f the 
popu la t ion l ives in the provinces w i t h the ma jo r i ty invo lved in the agrarian sector. 

In f ras t ruc tu re and construction. Cambodia's infrastructure indicators per capita are the lowes t 
in the region, fa l l ing beh ind L a o PDR. There i s substantial po ten t ia l t o increase b o t h pub l ic and 
p r iva te investment, and there has been a h is tory o f p r iva te par t ic ipa t ion par t icu lar ly in mob i le 
te lecom and power. As described be low , a lack o f transparency and corrup t ion in infrastructure 
deals appears to be the key constraint. 

0 Extractives. In terna t iona l f i r m s have discovered quantities o f off-shore o i l and gas reserves that 
are be l ieved t o be commerc ia l ly viable. W h i l e prev ious ly these had been located in zones subject 
t o te r r i to r ia l dispute, recent discoveries are c lear ly in Cambodian te r r i to ry . Recent interest has 
been shown in mining m inera ls in the N o r t h East o f Cambod ia and exp lo r ing the po ten t ia l o f o i l 
deposits close to the Ton le Sap lake. The lack o f a transparent lega l and regu la tory structure fo r 
managing the concessions appears to be a constraint. 

0 Services. The pace o f urban iza t ion has increased, crea t ing an increas ing ly v iab le urban market 
w i t h gradua l ly increasing purchasing power . This has l e d to rap id g row th o f re ta i l trade. 
However , this remains in i t s in fancy . There are n o mode rn forma t supermarkets or shopping

THE K E Y CHALLENGES 

4. 
Sustained h igh g row th would requ i re a mo re conducive environment fo r p r iva te sector 
development and long-term investment. The Govemment and donors ca l led fo r a renewed emphasis on 
sustainable g row th in the 2002 Consultative Group meetings, and the W o r l d Bank G roup has been 
wo rk ing toward these objectives. In 2003, the W o r l d Bank supported an Investment C l ima te Survey in 
2003 o f 502 enterprises in 10 sectors in f ive ma jo r Cambodian cities: Phnom Penh, S iem Reap, Kampong 
Cham, Sihanoukville, and Battambang. These enterprises ranged in size f r o m m ic ro (fewer than 10 
employees) to large (over 100 employees) and inc luded b o t h domestic f i r m s and those w i t h fore ign 
ownership. 

The Produc t iv i ty Challenge 

5. 
T h e key challenge i s to raise product iv ity levels to a l low mo re g row th and employment, o r 
in the case o f the garment sector, to re ta in existing employment. The results o f the I C A ind ica te that 
to ta l factor p roduc t iv i ty i s 18 percentage po in ts be low Ind ia , 24 po in ts be low China, wh i le rough ly even 
w i t h Bangladesh. Because o f i t s scarcity, the p roduc t iv i ty o f cap i ta l i s high. However , TFP i s brought 
down b y labor produc t iv i ty , wh ich i s rough ly 65 percent beh ind Ind ia , 62 percent beh ind China, and 
about 10 percentage points be low Bangladesh. Labo r costs are low , but do n o t compensate fo r l o w 
p roduc t iv i ty levels.

0 T h e p r im a r y constraints a re governance-related. Cambodia f i r m s iden t i fy corrup t ion as their 
lead ing constraint. Fou r - f i f ths o f the pr iva te sector sampled acknowledges the necessity o f pay ing 
bribes, and 7 1 percent o f large firms repor t that these payments are frequent. The pr iva te sector 
estimates that uno f f ic ia l payments cost f i r m s an average o f 5.2 percent o f to ta l sales revenue. 
Business's v iew o f agency in teg r i ty i s a larm ing ly negative, w i t h the Jud ic iary and Customs v iewed 
the most negatively. Compar ing these ratings to results f r om a related 1999/2000 survey, perceptions 
o f corrup t ion have no t improved . U n f a i r and in fo rma l compe t i t ion and the func t ion ing o f the

0 T r a d e fac i l itat ion processes a re pa r t icu la r ly constraining, w i t h the second longest clearance times 
after Pakistan and some o f the highest observed incidences o f uno f f ic ia l costs in any ICA. W i t h i n 
Cambodia's regu la tory environment, impo r t and export processes were iden t i f ied as hav ing the 
highest uno f f ic ia l costs at the t ime o f the survey (June 2003). The B a n k supported a 2003 Va lue 
Cha in Ana lys is wh ich found that the cause o f h i g h trade costs was n o t re la ted to any one par t icu lar 
ins t i tu t ion , but rather the cumu la t ive impac t o f over lapp ing institutions, each o f wh ich requ ired 
streamlining. 

0 W e a k governance o f pub l ic-pr ivate partnerships and concessions. The ins t i tu t iona l framework 
fo r pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in in fras truc ture (PPI) in Cambodia has been weak, as manifested b y a lack o f 
c la r i ty over roles and respons ib i l i t ies w i t h i n and between various government agencies w i t h respect to 
PPI design, procurement, approvals and implementation, a general l a c k o f transparency in the 
hand l ing o f dealings between the pub l ic and pr iva te sectors, and spec i f ica l ly in the nego t ia t ion and 
management o f contracts between government and investors, f r om the in i t ia t ion o f a po ten t ia l pro jec t 
through the construction, imp lemen ta t ion or transaction t o the operation o f the p ro jec t - few i f any 
concession agreements o r negotiated contracts have been made available f o r audit o r pub l ic scrutiny. 

- 117 - 

0 Closed, non-transparent transactions characterized most p r iva te in f ras t ruc tu re concessions. 
The consequences o f these problems inc lude non-bankable projects, h igher than necessary p r ices to 
consumers in the Cambodian economy, and a lack o f in fo rma t ion on the value-for-money received b y 
the public and the RGC f r om infrastructure projects, due to the inab i l i ty t o assess the full value set o f 
risks and the d is tr ibu t ion o f revenues and p ro f i ts in concessions. 

0 A lack o f credible lega l institutions. Progress i s be ing made on commerc ia l laws and regulations, 
but j u d i c i a l capacity, remuneration and in teg r i ty are n o t be ing addressed. This has restricted the 
ab i l i ty o f the f inanc ia l sector to expand services to even 10 percent o f the pr iva te sector, and 
undermines investor confidence. Lega l decisions are seen in the pr iva te sector as arbitrary and 
subject t o capture. Cred ib le alternatives to the courts f o r the reso lu t ion o f commerc ia l disputes have 
no t been ins t i tu t iona l ized . 

The Diversijication Challenge 

6. 
T h e second challenge o f p r iva te sector development i s to b roaden the base o f economic 
opportun ity and jobs. 
The pr iva te sector i s excep t iona l ly narrowly-based. 
The garment sector 
contributes near ly fou r - f i f ths o f Cambodia's to ta l o f f ic ia l exports, yet, emp loymen t and the great ma jo r i ty 
o f enterprises nume r ica l ly are concentrated in agriculture and agro-industry,' wh ich exports l i t t l e and has 
less than h a l f the labor p roduc t iv i ty o f the garment sector. F o r reasons o f equity, risk, and pover ty 
reduction, the coun try needs a broader base o f firms and sectors that operate at higher p roduc t iv i ty levels. 
F r o m a cost and resources standpoint, Cambodia may have a comparative advantage in agro-industry. 
However , ru ra l markets are fragmented, w i t h the bulk o f sales made to loca l ind iv idua l consumers.

T h e third challenge o f pr ivate sector development i s to p lay a ro le in imp rov ing access to 
efficient and affordab le water , electricity, transport, and telecommunication services. This can 
have m a j o r impacts on Cambod ian l iv ing standards and on the investment c l imate . E f f ic ien t 
in fras truc ture i s essential to sustain economic g row th and indus tr ia l competitiveness. Cambodia has one 
o f the lowes t e lec tr i f ica t ion rates outside sub-Saharan A f r ica ; i t has n o power transmission system and has 
n o large generation capacity. Where e lec tr ic i ty i s available, f i r m s and ind iv idua l consumers face some o f 
the highest energy prices in the wor ld . Cambodia has the least developed road ne two rk in the reg ion w i t h 
the smallest percentage o f paved roads. 

9. 
I t i s d iff icu lt to see how Cambod ia can address these backlogs in a short per iod using 
in te rna l resources alone. 
Inadequate domestic revenue mob i l iza t ion and skewed pub l ic expenditure 
allocations have kep t Cambodia heav i ly dependent on fo re ign a id fo r f inanc ing the p rov is ion o f basic 
goods and services. A 2002 study revealed that 65 percent o f the costs o f a l l in fras truc ture projects to be 
undertaken between 1999 and 2001 had n o iden t i f ied source o f funding.’ Further, government resources 
are able t o cover less than one- th ird o f the to ta l annual cost o f rehab i l i ta t ion and m a i n t e n a n ~ e . ~ There i s 
g row ing recogn i t ion around the wo r ld that the pr iva te p rov is ion o f infrastructure, w i t h i n an appropriate 
contractual and regulatory framework, can o f fe r services at lowe r unit costs, w i t h faster implementation, 
reduced who le l i f e costs, better risk allocation, better incentives to perform, imp roved management o f 
qua l i ty , enhanced public management, and at times generate revenues. The need fo r e f f ic iency in service 
de l ive ry i s a key dr iver fo r change and creates an oppor tun i ty fo r grow th . A number o f in terna t iona l 
f i r m s have already made substantial investments in power, telecom, transport, and airports. 

10. 
Howeve r , PPI practices prevent Cambod ia f r om enjoying the benefits o f p r iva te 
part ic ipat ion . There i s a general lack o f transparency in the nego t ia t ion and management o f contracts 
between government and investors. Few i f any concession agreements o r negotiated contracts have been 
made available fo r review, pub l ica t ion , audit, o r pub l ic scrutiny. S ign i f ican t gaps pervade in the lega l 
framework in a number o f sectors, w i t h some over-arch ing sector laws s t i l l in draft, and persistent 
bypassing o f ex is t ing laws and processes. Scant respect i s pa id to exam in ing and documen t ing contingent 
and ongo ing l iab i l i t ies taken o n by the pub l ic sector. P lann ing processes across sectors are generally 
inadequate, and as a result, p r iva te f i r m s frequen t ly present unso l ic i ted offers independent o f sector plans 
o r in con f l ic t w i t h prev ious ly negotiated concessions. L i t t l e aud i t ing o f concessions takes place p r io r to 
o r after implementation. In several sectors, there are mu l t ip le agencies p rov id ing oversight, licenses, and 
permissions t o operate, but l im i t e d coord ina t ion between them. In some instances, o f f i c i a l l y designated 
roles and responsibilities have been over-r idden b y more senior ind iv idua ls . The powe r sector i s we l l -

0 Evo lv ing lega l infrastructure . Lega l and jud ic ia l r e f o rm has been an area o f s low progress over the 
past f i v e years, but there are ind ica t ions that CY05 may see the development o f a more conducive 
regu la tory framework . At the t ime o f w r i t ing , the f o l l ow i n g laws had either already been presented to 
Parliament or were in an advanced stage o f the d ra f t ing process: the Company Law , the Inso lvency

Cambodia: Debt Sustainability 
(IMF, August 2004) 

1. 
Under the staff‘s baseline scenario, Cambodia’s debt i s expected to be 
sustainable.’ The baseline scenario assumes sustained real GDP g row th o f 6 percent, export 
g row th o f 9 percent, and b road ly stable foreign a id in nom ina l U .S . dollars. O n the fiscal 
front, budgetary consolidation i s expected to begin w i t h the 2004 budget, wh ich w o u l d 
require discretionary tax revenue measures and improvements in tax and customs 
administration. 

A. The Current Situation 

2. 
Cambodia’s total external public debt was $3.0 billion (71 percent of GDP) at 
end-2003, of which $1.9 billion was owed to the United States and the Russian 
Federation. Other external debts were owed largely to mu l t i la te ra l creditors o n highly 
concessional te rms . Domestic pub l ic debt, a l l denominated in loca l currency, accounted fo r 
about 5 percent o f GDP. 

3. 
Restructuring Cambodia’s debts to the United States and the Russian 
Federation in highly concessional terms, which together account for 64 percent of total 
external debt, i s cr it ica l fo r securing debt sustainability. The baseline scenario assumes 
that agreement i s reached with the U . S . by mid-2004 o n comparable t e r m s t o the 1995 Paris 
C lub agreement (Le., f l o w rescheduling o n Naples te rms ) . I t assumes a 40-year maturity, a 
16-year grace period, and an in te res t rate o f 3 percent. Similar t e rm s are assumed o n the debt 
owed to the Russian Federation, after an i n i t i a l up f ion t discount o f 70 percent. The 
restructured debt wou ld amount to $1.7 b i l l i o n at the end o f 2004. The to ta l stock o f 
outstanding debt at the end o f 2004 w o u l d amount to $2.1 b i l l i o n (46 percent o f GDP), o r 
29 percent o f GDP in n e t presen t value (NPV) t e rm s . 

B. Public Debt Sustainability 

4. 
Cambodia’s stock of public debt i s projected to decline after an initial increase 
from 34 percent of GDP in 2004 to 35 percent of GDP in 2006 in NPV terms. In the 
baseline scenario, total pub l ic sector debt in N P V t e rm s i s expected t o f a l l t o 16 percent by 
2023 i f the p r ima ry de f ic i t i s kept to about 2% percent o f GDP over the medium t e r m and to 
about 3 percent o f GDP in t h e longer run. The N P V o f the debt-to-revenue ra t io at 
237 percent in 2004 i s high, re f lec t ing the weak revenue base. Hence, fa i lu re t o imp rove 
revenue co l lec t ion steadily over time w o u l d undermine pub l ic debt sustainability. 

Standard Fund templates fo r l o w income countries and sens i t iv i ty tes ts are used to assess 
Cambodia’s debt dynamics. Tests i n v o l v e applying temporary deviations o f key variables 
f r om the baseline w i t h magnitudes based largely o n h is to r ica l deviations.

Sens it iv ity tests suggest t h a t the deb t dynam ics a r e vu lne rab le to a r e a l

the long te rm . A one- t ime 3 0 percen t r e a l dep rec ia t ion in 2004 (test BS) w o u l d increase the 
NPV o f the deb t - to -GDP r a t i o f rom 3 4 percen t o f GDP in the base l ine to ove r 50 pe rcen t o f 
GDP , and the N P V o f the debt-to-revenue ra t io t o m o r e than 300 pe rcen t in the m e d i u m te rm . 
A 10 percen t o f GDP increase in deb t-crea t ing f l ow s in the f i r s t p ro jec ted year (test B6), such 
as might arise fiom a n unexpec ted rea l iza t ion o f con t ingen t l iab i l i t ies , w o u l d increase the 
NPV o f the deb t - to -GDP and debt-to-revenue ra t ios t o 40 pe rcen t a n d 2 7 0 percent, 
respec t ive ly . I f the r e a l GDP g r ow t h ra te were to f a l l by two s tandard dev ia t ions f i o m i t s 
recen t average (test B4), w h i c h corresponds b road ly t o the d i f fe rence be tween the GDP 
g r ow t h shown in the non-ad jus tmen t scenario and the base l ine p resen ted in the m a i n text (see 
paragraph 14), the N P V o f the debt-to-revenue ra t io w o u l d reach abou t 2 4 0 pe rcen t in the 
m e d i um te rm . 

C . E x t e r n a l D e b t Sus ta inab i l i ty 

6. 
I n the base l ine scenario, a l l deb t ind ica to rs a r e p ro jec ted to im p r o v e ove r t ime . 
The N P V o f the deb t - to -GDP ra t ios are expec ted t o f a l l b e l o w 20 percen t , the NPV o f the 
deb t- to-expor ts ra t ios t o f a l l b e l ow 30 percen t and the deb t serv ice- to-expor ts r a t i o w o u l d 
dec l ine t o b e l o w 2 pe rcen t in the l o n g run. 

7. 
T h e deb t dynam ics a r e most vu lne rab le to a r e a l dep rec ia t ion a n d expo r t 
decline. A one - t ime 3 0 pe rcen t r e a l dep rec ia t ion w o u l d push up the NPV o f the deb t - to -GDP 
r a t i o t o abou t 45 percen t in the near te rm . A one- t ime t w o standard d e v i a t i o n shock in 
exports, w h i c h i s abou t t w i c e as la rge as the shock assumed in the non -ad jus tmen t scenario in 
the m a i n text, w o u l d ra ise the deb t serv ice- to-expor ts r a t i o t o 4.8 pe rcen t compa red with 
3 .4 pe rcen t in the base l ine scenario, and the NPV o f the deb t- to-expor ts r a t i o w o u l d r ise t o 
91 percen t compa red with 5 8 percen t in the baseline scenario in 2013. E v e n then, these ra t ios 
are n o t high enough t o threa ten ex te rna l v i a b i l i t y . 

D. Conc lus ion 

8. 
T h e k e y vu lne rab i l i ty in Cambod ia ’s deb t dynam ics i s i t s w e a k f isca l revenue 
base. W h i l e the n om i n a l s tock o f deb t and serv ice paymen ts are modes t re la t ive t o GDP , the 
revenue base, cu r ren t ly a t 1 1 percen t o f GDP , m a y pose d i f f i c u l t i e s in se rv ic ing debt. A
