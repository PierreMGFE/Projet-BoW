EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

D u r i n g the late 1980s and most of the 1990s, domestic and regional military strife led 
to deep macroeconomic imbalances and weakened economic activity in D j ibou t i . A p ro longed 
c i v i l war d is rup ted v i t a l economic sectors and imposed a heavy cost o n the budget. War in 
ne ighbo r ing countries l e d to a large i n f l u x o f refugees, putting an ex t ra bu rden o n already 
stretched p u b l i c services. F isca l mismanagement and wan ing dono r suppo r t compounded the 
impac t o f these shocks lead ing t o a b u i l d - u p o f Government arrears o f some 30 percent o f GDP 
by 2000. The Cu r rency Board Arrangement l im i t e d the possibility o f the use o f mone ta ry 
ins t rumen ts in mac roeconom ic management. GDP g r ow t h averaged less than one percent during 
th is period, compared with an average popu la t ion g r ow t h rate o f 2.8 percent per annum fu r the r 
deepening pove r ty . 

.. 11. 

D u r i n g the past four years-the period of the last CAS-good progress was made in 
addressing many of these problems. Supported by an IDA F isca l Conso l ida t ion C red i t (FCC), 
and an IMF Poverty Reduc t ion and G r ow t h F a c i l i t y (PRGF), f isca l a n d s t ruc tu ra l r e f o rm 
measures succeeded in h a l t i n g t h e de te r io ra t ing macroeconomic s i tua t ion and reve rs ing the build 
up o f domestic arrears. These measures inc luded c i v i l service downs iz ing , a far-reaching 
pens ion r e f o rm that placed the system o n a m u c h stronger footing, im p r o v e d management o f the 
p o r t and a i rpo r t fac i l i t ies by en t rus t ing i t to a p r iva te in tema t iona l investor, and strengthening o f 
p u b l i c expenditure ins t i tu t ions . 

iii. However, this improved macro economic stability, while critical, i s not sufficient to 
deal with the deep structural problems of poverty and income distribution and take the coun t y 
low social and economic equilibrium. Desp i te i t s high p e r cap i ta income 
out of 
the trap of 
(US$920 in 2004) that places i t in the r a n k s o f l o w m idd le - income countries, D j i b o u t i has an 
ex t reme ly high inc idence o f p o v e r t y (42 percent absolute and 75 percent re la t ive p o v e r t y rates), 

and a v e r y low l e v e l o f human development as indicated, among others, by one o f t h e lowes t 

schoo l en ro l lmen t and highest m o r t a l i t y rates in the wo r ld . At the same t ime , high wage rates in 
the f o rm a l sector create serious p rob lems o f non-competitiveness and skewed income 
d is t r ibu t ion . A l l these factors have con t r ibu ted to l o w g r ow t h and emp loymen t c rea t ion and 
wou ld , in the future, con t inue t o limit the p o s s i b i l i t y f o r D j ibou t ians t o b e n e f i t f r o m emp loymen t 
oppo r tun i t ies that w o u l d be generated f r o m the envisaged ex tens ion o f t h e p o r t and the 
development o f an associated free trade zone. 

iv. 

Djibouti’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), presented to the Boa rd on June 
S, 2004, identifies an ambitious four-pronged strategv. T h e strategy a ims at: (i) strengthening 
competitiveness f o r h ighe r and sustainable g r ow t h by pe rseve r ing with o v e r a l l mac roeconom ic 
stability, while accelerating s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms t o create a be t te r inves tmen t c l ima te for p r iva te 
investment; (ii) accelerating human deve lopmen t th rough im p r o v e d schoo l en ro l lmen t and 
q u a l i t y o f education, strengthening the hea l th care system, b roaden ing the soc ia l safety net; and 
imp lemen t ing the na t iona l gender strategy; (iii) p r om o t i n g reg iona l and l o c a l development t o 
reach ou t t o poo r urban neighborhoods, nomads, and iso la ted r u r a l commun i t ies ; and (iv) 
im p r o v i n g governance and public sector management through greater transparency and 
accountability. 

v. 

The planned CAS for the period FY06-OS i s broadly aligned w i th the ma in p i l la rs of 
the PRSP, building on the achievements of 
the previous CAS , which has also focused on the 
same areas. Solid pe r fo rmance has been ach ieved unde r the p rev ious CAS , marking a clear 
departure f r o m the past: a l l p rog rams were, or are expected t o be, comp le ted o n o r ahead o f time; 

11 

p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance im p r o v e d d rama t ica l ly mee t ing a l l p o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance targets; and 
eve ry p ro jec t i s expected t o meet i t s developmental objectives. T h e p lanned IDA p r o g r am w o u l d 
support the pillars o f PRSP th rough lending and non - lend ing serv ices . The competitiveness 
pillar w i l l b e suppo r ted through: (i) a p ow e r and water sector p ro jec t t o l ow e r u t i l i t ies ’ cost and 
extend service d e l i v e r y t o the poor, and (ii) a p a r t i a l r i s k guarantee t o the concession o f the r a i l 
link t o E t h i o p i a in support o f the p o r t to complement the p rev ious r o a d co r r ido r p ro jec t . Support 
t o the human deve lopmen t pillar w i l l consist o f (i) a second education p ro jec t (APL), f o l l ow i n g 
o n a f i r s t successful project; (ii) a s k i l l s development and emp loymen t c rea t ion project, and (iii) 
an emergency f loods rehab i l i ta t ion project. Support to the governance p i l l a r focuses on providing 
assistance t h r o u g h IDF grants t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f the ac t ion p rog ram and recommendations 
o f the C o u n t r y F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessmen t (C F A A ) and C o u n t r y Procurement 
Assessment R e v i ew (CPAR). 

vi. 
This CAS argues for a more active incomd ren t distribution policy (more so than the 
PRSP) as a critical policy reform area to reduce poverty, because Djibouti’s skewed income 
distribution impedes the trickle down of the benefits of growth to the poor, and because, in the 
case of a rent-based economy l ike Djibouti, it w i l l continue to act as a major constraint to 

growth itsew D j i b o u t i i s essentially a rent-based economy, w i th ren ts deriving f r o m i t s 
geographical and geopo l i t ica l p o s i t i o n con t r ibu t ing a m u c h la rge r share o f GDP than ag r icu l tu re 
and industry. At present, most o f the rent (revenues f r o m the port, r e n t o f military bases, and 
grants and assistance), essentially channeled th rough the budget, i s cap tu red by the c i v i l service 
in the fo rm o f high p u b l i c wages (the average public wage i s 9 -10 t imes GDP pe r capita). This 
deprives the m a j o r i t y o f the popu la t ion f r o m bene f i t ing f r o m p u b l i c services, such as education 
and health, because the excessive size o f the p u b l i c wage b i l l (50 percent o f the budget) leaves 
n o r o o m f o r im p r o v i n g service de l ive ry beyond i t s v e r y l o w leve l . In a d d i t i o n t o c r ow d i n g ou t 
soc ia l expenditures and inves tmen t in human capital, the ove rs ized wage b i l l c rowds ou t 
inves tmen t in p h y s i c a l in f ras t ruc tu re that fb r the r d r ives up the cost o f d o i n g business. T h e fixed 
exchange ra te p o l i c y emanating f r o m the Cu r rency B o a r d Arrangements, keeps r e a l wages high 
as i t shelters i t f r o m any adjustment th rough general p r i c e increase. Taken together, these factors 
impede g r ow t h and emp loymen t and, in turn, hurt the poo r . 

vii. W i th rents associated with the port and the m i l i ta y bases, and foreign a id expected to 
continue to be the major drivers of Government revenues and GDP, the only policy option 
available to the Government in the short run to improve poverty and income distribution i s to 
f i n d ways to reduce pub l ic sector wage expenditures and redistribute these towards social and 

infrastructure expenditures. This can b e ach ieved th rough the comb ina t ion o f an adjustment in 
the exchange rate, an e x p l i c i t reduc t ion in wages, and a restructuring o f the size and compos i t ion 
o f the c i v i l service. T h e C A S proposes to i n t e n s i f y the p o l i c y d ia logue with the authorities t o

and other 
f inanc ing 
facilities 
i s also an 
impo r tan t source. This i s reflected in the la rge 
share o f the service sector in the economy, 

Box 1: H istor ica l Background 

France established the port o f D j ibou t i in 1892 as a 
coaling station for ships traveling to its possessions in the 
Indian Ocean and Far East. Four years later, D j ibou t i 
became a French territory. In 1977, after 80 years o f 
colonial rule, Djibouti gained independence from France. 
At the time o f independence, an agreement between 
France and D j ibou t i provided for a French military 
presence and development assistance, including sizable 
budgetary support. 

1.3 

W i th a per capita income of US$920, D j ibou t i i s classified as a low middle-income 
country. Yet, it has a very high level of poverty (42% absolute and 75% relative) and some of 

the poorest social indicators i n the world. T h i s paradox i s exp la ined essentially by the fact that 
w h i l e a la rge pa r t o f the economy i s based o n ren ts (de r ived f r o m the po r t , military bases ren ta l 
and donors f inanc ia l support), and channeled m a i n l y through the budget, a s ign i f ican t part o f th is 
ren t i s passed o n t o Gove rnmen t employees th rough high wages, l e a v i n g insu f f ic ien t resources 
for soc ia l expenditures, soc ia l t rans fe rs and p u b l i c investment. 
Because o f the ma rg ina l 
con t r ibu t ion o f the primary and secondary sectors in the process o f p roduc t ion , Gove rnmen t 
expenditure p o l i c y i s the primary ins t rumen t ava i lab le f o r ach iev ing i n c om e re -d is t r ibu t ion in the 
short- t o med ium - te rm . A c h i e v i n g a better i n c om e distribution must b e at the heart o f the 
Government’s p o v e r t y reduc t ion strategy, g i v e n the p r e v a i l i n g degree o f p o v e r t y and l o w l e v e l o f 
human cap i ta l development in D j i b o u t i . T h i s im p l i e s a need f o r d i f f i c u l t p o l i c y actions i f the

Djibouti’s political system remains, however, relatively open, with a n elected president, 
a Pa r l iamen t and a jud ic ia ry . The executive re f lec ts a sharing o f p ow e r b e tw e e n the tw o m a j o r 
ethnic groups with h ighe r representation o f the Issas in t h e Government, c i v i l service, and the 
ruling party. This powe r sharing i s subject to sporadic resentments (and challenges) by the 
A fa rs . W i d e l y acc la imed re fo rms toward a m o r e meritocracy-based access t o c i v i l service and

1.6 
Djibouti’s international relations and partnerships strengthened in the last 3 years and 
a re expected to deepen during the CAS period. In add i t ion t o D j i b o u t i ’ s s t rong h i s t o r i c a l

also creates the r i s k o f t a k i n g the pressure o f f the much-needed reforms, a possibility that the 
Gove rnmen t and the donors shou ld gua rd against. 

1.7 
Commercial relations with E th iop ia (currently capturing more than 60 percent of the 
Djibouti’s po r t traffic) have become easier. T h i s f o l l ow e d the s igna ture in April 2003 o f an

C. SOCIAL CONTEXT 

1.10 Djibouti’s social indicators rank 157 th among 1 7 4 countries on the UNDP’s H u m a n 
Development Index. Desp i te recent progress in expand ing access, D j i b o u t i ’ s educa t ion system 
i s s t i l l n o t on t rack to mee t the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goa ls (MDGs). I l l i t e r a c y i s ex t reme ly 
high, especially f o r w om e n (85 percent). About 50 percent of children still do not attend 

3 

school, and mo re than 20 percent of those enrolled do not complete the s i x years of primary 

education. The re are also la rge inequa l i t ies in access to education services: en ro l lmen t varies 
w i d e l y across i n c om e leve ls , gender, and regions. Mo reove r , the system i s v e r y cos t ly due t o the 
high unit costs for schoo l cons t ruc t ion and teacher salaries. Un fo r tuna te ly , desp i te the enormous 
needs, the budge t does not have m u c h room for add i t iona l expenditures since education 
expenditure a l ready accounts f o r close t o 27 percent o f D j i b o u t i ’ s la rge budget size o f 3 0 percent 
o f GDP. These constraints render the achievements o f the MDGs n e a r l y imposs ib le (see Tab le 
1, o n cost o f ach iev ing educa t ion goals). 

1.11 T h e health situation i s also very difficult. L i f e expectancy, as an ove ra l l hea l th 
indicator, i s estimated at 49 years, one o f the shortest in the wo r ld . Infant m o r t a l i t y i s at 103 pe r 
1,000. The imm u n i z a t i o n ra te i s o n l y 45 percent, and m a l n u t r i t i o n i s a serious problem, with 
ind ica t ions that 14 percent o f ch i ld ren unde r the age o f f i v e su f fe r f r o m acute ma lnu t r i t ion , and 
3 1 percent f r o m ch ron ic ma lnu t r i t ion . D ia r rhe ic illnesses and acute resp i ra to ry in fec t ions are the 
mos t c omm o n causes o f infant mo r ta l i ty . Ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y ra te i s high at about 7 p e r 1,000 
l i v e births and for ex t reme ly p o o r w om e n this rate i s as high as 9 percent. 

1.12 Wide gender gap and Fema le Genital Mu t i la t ion (FGM) a re major social 

developmental challenges. W om e n represent a v e r y vu lne rab le segment o f the popu la t ion . The 
disadvantaged status o f w om e n i s re f lec ted in the gender gap ind ica to rs in a l l soc ia l areas as 
ind ica ted above. High female m o r t a l i t y rates can b e a t t r ibu ted t o high f e r t i l i t y rates, anemia 
caused by ma lnu t r i t ion , w h i c h are in turn exacerbated by the w idesp read p rac t ice o f female 
c i rcumc is ion . N i n e t y - f i v e percent o f young girls be tween 6 and 9 years o f age have undergone 
FGM. In f ibu la t ions , the m o s t severe and h a rm f u l f o r m o f FGM, are the m o s t w i d e l y practiced. 
T h e y are k n o w n t o cause serious l i f e l o n g nega t ive phys ica l and psycho log ica l impacts. T h i s also 
increases the i r vu lne rab i l i ty t o H I V / A I D S in fec t ion . 

1.13 A law prohibiting the practice of FGM was adopted in 1995, but has proved difJicult to 
enforce because of 
the private nature of 

the procedure. T h e N a t i o n a l Strategy f o r the 
In teg ra t ion o f W om e n in Deve lopmen t (SNIFD), adopted by the new M i n i s t r y o f W o m e n A f f a i r s 
in 2002, inc ludes the fight against this p rac t ice as one o f i t s pillars. The re have also been several 
recen t ly organized wo rkshops and awareness campaigns i n v o l v i n g r e l i g i o u s leaders, l o c a l and 
in tema t iona l NGOs, UN agencies, and Gove rnmen t o f f i c i a l s to help stop the practice. 

The Qat Problem i s not adequately addressed. Considerable t i m e and resources are

11. POVERTY AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION-THE PARADOX OF HIGH INCOME PER 
CAPITA AND HIGH AND INCREASING POVERTY 

Recent data’ show that poverty in D j ibou t i i s both extremely high and on the rise. In 

2.1 
2002, about th ree - fou r ths (74.4 percent) o f the popu la t ion l i v e d unde r re la t ive p o v e r t y l i n e and 
42.2 percent unde r extreme poverty, as compared t o 64.9 percent and 34.5 percent, respectively, 
in 1996. Su rveys show that the most dramatic poverty inc idence i s in r u r a l areas, whe re 83 
percent l i v e s in extreme pove r ty . Howeve r , D j i b o u t i - V i l l e shelters the largest numbe r o f p o o r 
peop le and con t r ibu tes by itself-65 
percent and 57 percent-to 
re la t ive and extreme pove r ty , 
respectively. T h e EDAM I S study indicates that the inc idence o f re la t ive and extreme p o v e r t y i s 
the strongest among households whose heads are unemployed. Unemp loymen t , w h i c h i s 
estimated at 6 0 percent, contributes about 65 percent to extreme pove r ty . W h a t exp la ins the 
apparent pa radox o f a re la t ive ly high GNI p e r cap i ta o f about US$920, w h i c h places D j i b o u t i at 
close t o middle income countries, and i t s high and inc reas ing poverty ra te that places i t among 

the poorest? The main explanation of such a paradox lies in the sensitivity of poverty t o income 
distribution and on D j ibou t i ’s budget structure wh ich is biased against the poo r . 

2.2 

One of the strongest results of the two poverty studies i s the sensitive linkage between 
poverty incidence and income distribution. The 2 0 percent upper income household has a n 

average expend i tu re e igh t t imes h ighe r than the l ow e r qu in t i le . F o r l o w p o v e r t y lines, the studies 

no te that poverty is more sensitive to changes in expenditure inequality than t o changes in mean 

expenditures. I f the Gini I n d e x o f expenditure d i s t r i b u t i o n increases by 1 percent, ceteris 
paribus, the extreme pove r ty index i s estimated to increase be tween 1 t o 4.2 percent3. The p o o r 

are more affected by changes i n expenditure inequality than by changes in mean expenditure. 

This im p l i e s tha t an economic g r ow t h that i s accompanied by increased i n e q u a l i t y has the 
po ten t ia l to b e an “immiserating” g row th . This h igh l igh ts the c r i t i c a l impo r tance o f an ac t ive 
income red is t r ibu t ion p o l i c y that should accompany, if not even precede growth, in o rde r f o r 
D j i b o u t i ’ s p o v e r t y reduc t ion strategy t o b e effective. T o reduce ex t reme p o v e r t y t o the PRSP 
goa l o f 19.3 percent in 2015, the PRSP i t s e l f unde r l ines the need f o r “an annual r e a l g r ow t h ra te 
o f GDP p e r cap i ta o f 2.5 percent in 2005 -10 and o f 3.5 pe rcen t in 2010-15, [comb ined with] a 
regu la r reduc t ion o f inequa l i t ies o f 2 percent pe r year.” G i v e n the unce r ta in g r ow t h prospects 
that are h e a v i l y dependent o f external factors, re -d is t r ibu t ion m u s t b e an impo r tan t part o f short- 
t e rm agenda o f p o v e r t y reduction. 

2.3 

Labo r market distortion, high pub l ic sector and civil service wages, and the size of the 
Government’s wage b i l l explain a great deal of the poverty and income distribution problem i n 

Djibouti. Pove r ty i s s t rong ly re la ted t o unemp loymen t in D j i b o u t i . U n em p l o ym e n t has reached 
60 percent up f r o m 44 percent in 1996, and has a high inc idence among the p o o r (66 percent), 
and the ex t reme ly p o o r (72 percent). D j i b o u t i has a d u a l labo r ma rke t with about 7 0 percent o f 
the emp loyed in the fo rma l sector. F i f t y - f i v e percent o f those emp loyed in the f o rm a l sector are 
c i v i l servants. W h i l e unemp loymen t i s at 6 0 percent, the average wage in the formal sector in 
D j i b o u t i remains v e r y high. T h e persistence o f this pa radox i s l a r g e l y exp la ined by the high

2.4 
H i g h Government wages impact negatively on the poor by expanding the size of 
the 
pub l ic wage b i l l and crowding out other Government spending on basic services and direct 
transfers to the poo r . D j i b o u t i has, indeed, one o f the largest wage b i l l s among i t s comparators, 
in pa r t icu la r w h e n cons ide r ing the l o w service de l ive ry l e v e l . I t constitutes abou t 15 percent o f 
GDP, 60 pe rcen t o f to ta l f isca l revenues, and h a l f o f budget expenditures4. Cons ide r ing the v e r y

Th e political economy of such a reform i s obviously difficult as i t runs against the 
immediate interest of thepub l ic sector elite itsew But i n a c t i o n also has a high cost that D j i b o u t i 
p o l i c y makers need t o consider seriously. 

The high l e v e l and structure o f c i v i l p a y has been inhe r i ted f r o m the F rench co lon ia l adm in is t ra t ion and has l i t t l e 
changed since. By v ir tue o f D j i b o u t i ’ s Currency B o a r d s y s t em ( the n om i n a l exchange ra te has n o t changed since 
1971, i n f l a t i o n i s on ly about 2 percent, w h i c h does l i t t l e t o adjust d ow n the rea l wages as in other deve lop ing 
countries. 
Since mos t o f the Government revenues are in do l lars o r indexed t o i t and, a pa r t f r o m wages, mos t o f other 
expenditures are essentially impo r ted are in fore ign currency, a deva lua t ion w o u l d reduce the re la t ive s u e o f the

spending.

2.6 

In a d d i t i o n t o crowding ou t social expenditures, the oversized wage b i l l crowds out 
investment in infrastructure that could directly and indirectly benefit the poor through 
employment and growth. High p u b l i c wages and salaries also negatively affect 
the overall 
competitiveness of the economy and hinder growth. Red is t r ibu t ion in D j i b o u t i needs to go h a n d 

in hand, i f n o t precede, g row th . 

2.7 

I n the past, the inflexibility of wages and attendant wage b i l l have led to major 
structural f isca l imbalances, and the continuous avoidance of addressing the problem upfront 
has only shifted i t s effects to increase in other prices and further accumulation of arrears. A 

g r ow i n g p o p u l a t i o n and higher needs for p u b l i c service have exacerbated the f isca l s i tua t ion ove r 
the years. G i v e n D j i b o u t i ’ s cu r rency boa rd system, which excludes money c rea t ion t o finance

arrears, and/or a n increase in taxes and surtaxes, re f lec ted in h i g h e r prices, espec ia l ly o n services 
and service inputs, such as electricity, water, and pe t ro leum p roduc ts (surtaxes have, f o r

be tween 1978 and 1984 (with an average 4.2 percent g r ow t h pe r annum). This was boos ted by 
la rge p u b l i c inves tmen ts financed by generous external grants. But i t was n o t sustainable f o r

3.3 

Because of 
the currency Boa rd limitations on f inanc ing the large deficits through 
monetary creation, f isca l deficits were ultimately ‘ffinanced” by the accumulation of domestic 
arrears on payments of wages, pension funds contribution, and to private sector and pub l ic 

entities. This, in turn, l e d t o a loss o f c r e d i b i l i t y o f the state and an escalation in the use o f a d h o c 
procedures, such as uncon t ro l led advanced payments, that o f t e n c i rcumven ted the n o rm a l 
accoun t ing and con t ro l system. Mo reove r , such procedures reduced 
transparency and 
accountability, con t r ibu t ing to fu r the r overruns and distrust f r o m D j i b o u t i ’ s deve lopmen t 
partners w i th decrease in grants and external financing. 

T o address the destabilized and deteriorating economic situation, the Government 

3.4 
started an adjustment program in 1996, supported, first, by an IMF S tand -By A r rangemen t 
(SBA ) during 1996-1998. A tempo ra ry res to ra t ion o f f isca l balances was ach ieved th rough la rge 
cuts in p u b l i c expenditures and a f i rs t wave o f military demob i l iza t ion . But t h i s was n o t 
sustained as the budge t p o s i t i o n deteriorated again in 1999, and domestic arrears increased aga in 
t o reach m o r e than 27 percent o f GDP . G r o w t h ra te was also s l ow at 1.5 percent in spite o f the 
d ive rs ion o f a l l E t h i o p i a n transit trade f r o m E r i t rea po r ts t o the p o r t o f D j i b o u t i . 

3.5 

To enhance the stabilization effort, only partially successful under the SBA, the 
Government initiated a medium-term structural adjustment program (1 999-2002) supported by 

an IMF P o v e r t y Reduc t ion and G r o w t h Fac i l i ty (PRGF). T h e Gove rnmen t requested IDA ’S 
support t o i t s adjustment program. This was p r o v i d e d th rough the F i s c a l Conso l ida t ion C r e d i t in

3.6 

T h e F isca l Consolidation Credit focused on a core of 
interrelated f isca l consolidation 
actions to restore f inanc ia l and budgetary discipline; contain and reduce the wage bill; 
improve expenditure management systems; and strengthen f inanc ia l management of

Box 2: Djibouti’s Pension System Reform 
Under the FCC and w i th technical assistance from the World Bank, the 
Govemment undertook a comprehensive reform o f the pension system. T h e 
reform included a range o f corrective measures covering the parametric, 
financial and institutional aspects o f the pension system. The parametric 
reform comprised (i) unifying and extending the vesting period to 25 
years to be eligible for a fu l l retirement pension; (ii) extending the 
minimum age o f retirement from 50 to 55 years; (iii) changing the 
calculation mode o f k t u r e pension to using an average o f salaries earned 
over the last 10 years o f work, compounded b y a percentage o f a l l 
contributions; (iv) changing the r u l e s for cumulative pensions (c iv i l 
servants, Parliamentarians, and cabinet Ministers); (v) introducing a tax on 
pensions o f 15 percent; and (vi) ensuring a minimal yearly pension o f DF 
170,000 to guarantee a social safety net to pensioners. Part o f the 
outstanding stock o f Government a r rea rs to the pension funds were covered 
b y the FCC and since then, 
the Government resumed its regu lar 
contribution and effective payments to pension funds. T h e institutional part 
o f the reform included the merging into one single institution o f the 
different pension funds, but due to design problems i t didn’t progress as 
expected. Completing t h e merger o f the pension funds and expanding 
coverage are reminding challenges for the Government.

Over the past 4 years there has been progress in stabilizing the budget, pa r t ly in 
response to the fiscal consolidation efforts and higher port activities, and partly owing to the 
windfall from the regional security situation and the establishment of new foreign military

I V . DJIBOUTI POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY (PRSP) 

A. VISION, OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY 

4.1 
The Country Vision. As stated in i t s recen t PRSP, Djibouti’s poverty reduction strategy 
aims to foster economic growth by imp rov ing the country’s overall competitiveness and building 
human capital t o achieve a substantial reduction in income poverty and unemployment, and 
improve l i v i n g conditions fo r a l l citizens. The PRSP i s structured around a long-term v is ion that 
builds on the country’s s treng ths : i t s geographic location, and i t s port. The targeted reduction in 
poverty i s predicated o n enhancing the conditions fo r stronger, more equitable and sustainable 
growth. 

4.2 
The Objectives. The PRSP objectives are as follows: (i) to reduce the incidence o f 
extreme poverty f rom 42.2 percent in 2002 to 36.1 percent in 2006, to 27.9 percent in 2010, and 
to 19.2 percent in 2015; (ii) to increase the average rea l GDP g row th to 4.6 percent in 2004-06, 
to 5 .5 percent in 2006-10, and to 6.5 pe rcen t in 2010-15, while simultaneously reducing the 
inequa l i t ies in income distribution by an average 2 percent per annum during 2003-15; (iii) to 
increase gross p r ima ry school enrollment f rom 42.7 percen t in 2001/02 to 73 percent in 2005/06, 
and to achieve universal enrollment by 2015; (iv) to reduce the infant mo r ta l i ty rate f r om 103.1 
per thousand in 2002, to 75 per thousand in 2006, and to 50 per thousand in 2015; (v) to reduce 
the infant-juvenile mo r ta l i ty rate f rom 124.5 p e r thousand in 2002, to 85 per thousand in 2006, 
and to 70 per thousand in 2015; (vi) to reduce the matemal mo r ta l i ty rate f r om 690 per 100,000 
l i v e births in 2002, to 570 in 2006, and to 400 in 2015; and (vii) t o stabilize the rate o f 
prevalence o f H IV at approximately 3 percent by 2015. 

4.3 
The Strategy. The PRSP res ts on four ma in pillars. T h e f i r s t p i l l a r seeks to s treng then 
the country’s competitiveness and to create conditions conducive to a strong and sustainable 
economic growth through (i) the pursuit o f fiscal prudence and overall macroeconomic stability; 
(ii) the implementation o f structural reforms to attract p r iva te investment, inc lud ing the rev is ion 
o f the legal and jud ic ia l framework (an investment climate assessment i s planned fo r FY08); (iii) 
the promotion o f D j i b o u t i as a competitive economic and financial hub; and (iv) the reduction in 
the costs o f production factors through improved efficiency o f investments in the infrastructure 
sectors (water, power, transport). The secondp i l la r aims to accelerate the development o f human 
resources through the implementation o f social programs aimed at reducing poverty and gender 
disparities. In particular, the a im i s to: (i) improve the coverage and qua l i ty o f health care and 
education; (ii) reduce unemployment through the development o f labor-intensive activities, 
micro-finance provision, and j o b training, (iii) se t up social safety ne ts f o r the most vulnerable 
segmen ts o f the population; and (iv) implement the national gender strategy. The third pillar 
focuses o n regional and loca l development through investments in water and basic services in 
poor neighborhoods located in ru ra l and urban areas o f the country. The fourth p i l la r seeks to 
improve govemance and public sector management. The p r i o r i t y w i l l be to s t reng then the 
transparency and accountability o f public expenditure management to imp rove i t s distributional 
and efficiency impact on the poor. 

B. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC 

PROSPECTS UNDER THE C A S PERIOD (2005-08) 

10 

4.4 

I n the base case medium-term scenario, Djibouti would witness a relatively improved 
growth rate ow ing to the higher investment in the po r t and the pursuit of reforms a im ing to 
improve the efficiency of 

investments. A surge in p r iva te inves tmen t due t o the cons t ruc t ion o f 
the n ew m o d e m p o r t in Do ra leh and a higher p u b l i c investment in support o f the Government’s 
PRSP are expected t o boos t g r ow t h during the p e r i o d 2005-08 t o an average ra te o f 4 pe rcen t a 
year, at a h i g h e r pace than in the past, but less than the 4.6 percent pe r annum o n average 
an t ic ipa ted in t h e PRSP. I n f l a t i o n i s expected to r em a i n at i t s current average o f 2 pe rcen t as 
l o n g as the cu r rency b o a r d i s maintained. 

F isca l consolidation would be pursued to offset pressures on pub l ic finances stemming 

4.5 
from the PRSP implementation. The pursuit o f the budge ta ry conso l ida t ion e f fo r t (ba r r ing an 
expected s l ippage during the f i rs t h a l f o f 2005 w h i c h corresponds t o the P res iden t ia l e lec to ra l 
pe r iod ) shou ld resu l t in achieving a surplus in the primary budge t close t o 4 percent o f GDP o n 
average p e r annum. Such a surplus i s also needed t o ensure a con t inued imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
Gove rnmen t plan for clearing domestic arrears. F i s c a l conso l ida t ion w i l l b e achieved th rough 
e f fo r ts o n both expenditure and revenue sides. On the revenue side, add i t iona l e x t em a l 
disbursements o f military bases ren ta l l i n k e d t o n ew military agreements with the U n i t e d States 
and France (representing about 3 percentage p o i n t s o f GDP o n average p e r annum), w i l l 
ma te r ia l ize ove r the p ro jec ted period, and tax revenues are p ro jec ted t o r em a i n stable b e f o r e the 
n ew VAT i s in t roduced and implemented. On the expenditure side, t o t a l expenditures l e v e l w i l l 
r em a i n o v e r a l l stable. A shift in the structure o f expenditures t ow a r d h ighe r cap i ta l spend ing 
l i n k e d t o PRSP imp lemen ta t ion w i l l b e par t ia l ly balanced by l ow e r current expenditures t h r o u g h 
the pursuit o f re t i remen t programs and military demob i l iza t ion and the ra t iona l iza t ion o f o the r 
non -wage cu r ren t expenditures. 

Cu r ren t account pressures would intensifjl f inanc ing needs, but the external debt-to- 

4.6 
GDP ratio w i l l remain stable over the period 2005-2008. Total f inanc ing needs are expected t o 
increase f r o m US$135 million in 2003 t o US $ 1 6 4 m i l l i o n by 2006, and dec l ine thereafter t o 
reach U S $ 129 m i l l i o n by 2008. Higher current account de f ic i ts during the PRSP imp lemen ta t ion 
p e r i o d (2004-06) w i l l b e financed th rough add i t iona l extemal assistance, m o s t l y in the f o r m o f 
o f f i c i a l g r a n t s . A d d i t i o n a l n ew lending i s expected t o b e nego t ia ted o n concessional terms. 
F isca l conso l ida t ion efforts and p ruden t b o r r ow i n g shou ld h e l p m a i n t a i n Gove rnmen t debt-to- 
GDP t o sustainable leve ls (with external debt ave rag ing 68 pe rcen t o f GDP during the p ro jec ted 
period). The base case scenario also envisages a steady i n f l o w o f f o r e i g n d i rec t investment, 
a l though the pace w i l l c r i t i c a l l y depend u p o n maintaining the investors’ con f idence in the 
Government comm i tmen t t o enhance competitiveness, r u l e o f l a w and economic and soc ia l

B. OUTCOMES IN THE AREAS OF FISCAL CONSOLIDATION, COMPETITIVENESS AND GROWTH 

RESUMPTION 

5.4 

I n the second area of strategic focus of 
the CAS i.e., restoring economic growth 
through improvement of 
the port-linked infrastructure and structural adjustment and fiscal 
consolidation, macro stability was re-established and GDP pe r capita re-commenced its 
growth, but the impact on poverty reduction was rather disappointing. T h e IDA- f inanced 

Emergency Road Co r r ido r Rehabilitation p ro jec t and a supp lemen ta l c red i t t o th is project, we re

I n the a r e a of structural reforms, IDA-Jinanced Fiscal Consolidated Credit supported 
the most c r i t ica l policy reforms over the past four years, in particular in the area o f pension 
system reform, arrears management and clearing, and pub l ic enterprises r e f o rm (section 111). 
Djibouti's fiscal situation has been brought closer to stability, with improved-though 
f rom satisfactory-public 
f inance management. Since 2002, Djibouti's GDP per capita g row th 
has reverted to a positive trajectory after a long pe r iod o f decline. However, the impact on 
pove r ty has b e e n disappointing with the dramatic worsening o f pove r ty indicators between 1996 
and 2002 (section 11). With n o indication that this tendency has been reve rsed during the CAS 
period, the pressing need to confront upfront and actively the income d is t r ibu t ion p rob lem in 
D j i b o u t i i s underscored.

C. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 

5.6 
Portfolio management over the past CAS period improved dramatically. The project 
po r t fo l io showed a dramatic turn around with a l l po r t fo l io indicators turning from highly 
unsatisfactory to satisfactory o r highly satisfactory. Ratings for development objective and 
implementation progress o f a l l projects in the po r t fo l io are currently satisfactory. 
The 

disbursement ra t io has progressively increased to reach 28 percent in FY04, compared to o n l y 6 
percent in FYOO and to the target o f 18 percent se t in the CAS. Disbursement lags have b e e n 
reduced significantly, and project implementation time and e f f ic iency have also improved. In 
particular, the Education project w i l l be closing a year ahead o f schedule leading the w a y to an 
earlier than expected start of the second phase o f the Education APL. The implementation o f 
b o t h the International Corridor project and the Social Development and Pub l ic Wo rks project 
progressed m u c h better and much faster then planned; and the Boa rd approved tw o supplemental 
credits o n June 5,2003 and June 26,2003 respectively fo r these projects.

Factors that have contributed to the improvement in the quality and speed of 

implementation include: (i) focused, and s imp le r design o f the p ro jec ts adapted t o l o c a l 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity; (ii) a m o r e in tens ive supervision o f the p o r t f o l i o with a p rob lem - 
s o l v i n g approach, supported by closer invo lvemen t o f the Coun t ry Managemen t Unit and an 
excellent d ia logue with the Government; and (iii) a m o r e p roac t ive and p ro fess iona l Ex te rna l

they arose. 

VI. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. CHOICE OF FOCUS OF THE NEW C A S 

6.1 
D u r i n g the consultation process, the Bank team and the authorities discussed two 
options as to how to focus the CASp rog ram t o bring about higher effectiveness g i v e n the la rge 
demand fo r IDA support and the l i m i t e d available IDA allocation. 

Th e f i rs t option was to target the CAS program to one of the fou r p i l la rs of the PRSP 

6.2 
that the Gove rnmen t and IDA considered the mos t impo r tan t (e.g. soc ia l development), t o bring 
about a c r i t i c a l d i f fe rence in this pa r t icu la r area. 

6.3 

Th e second option was to cover more areas of 
the PRSP, a t the cost of spreading 
resources more thinly, using small but strategic interventions of mixed lending and ESW in 
each of 

the important areas. T h e ob jec t ive w o u l d be t o bring B a n k good practices and 
know ledge t o bear in m o r e than one area o f the PRSP, and to unlock higher mobilization of 

donor partner resources and assistance in these sectors. Several donors have experienced s low 

imp lemen ta t ion o f the i r programs due t o d i f f i c u l t i e s in d ia logue o n c r i t i c a l sectoral p o l i c y and 
ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm areas. Some donors have expressed interest in IDA’s i n v o l v em e n t in the i r 
area o f invo lvemen t /suppo r t because of: (i) I D A ’ s compa ra t ive ly g o o d q u a l i t y sector work (on 
education, wa te r and sewerage, energy, transport and the port, p u b l i c enterprise re fo rm , the 
pens ion system, C F A A and CPAR); (ii) I D A ’ s re la t ive ly good d ia logue o n c r i t i c a l s t ruc tu ra l 
issues advanced unde r the F C C process; and (iii) the good m om e n t um and exce l len t 
co l labo ra t ive sp i r i t and t rus t p r e v a i l i n g be tween the Government and the Bank . 

The second option i s favored. 

6.4 
I t w i l l allow the Bank to build o n the p rev ious C A S 
program, which was essentially in l i n e with the PRSP p r io r i t ies , the reby a l low ing , t o a ce r ta in 
limit, f o r the needed c r i t i c a l mass to a t ta in the deve lopmen ta l ob jec t ives o f the program and 
create the desired changes and improvements. 

B. ALIGNMENT TO THE PRSP PILLAR OF IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS, GROWTH AND INCOME 
DISTRIBUTION 

6.5 

Th e envisaged CAS program 
i n support of 
the PRSP p i l l a r of growth and 
competitiveness involves several interconnected actions, building on the investment and 
structural adjtlstment programs started under the previous CAS. Spec i f ica l ly , i t invo lves : (i) 

m o v i n g a step W h e r in addressing f isca l consolidation, im p r o v i n g competitiveness, and i n c om e 
d is t r ibu t ion - - th is would b e ca r r ied ou t t h r o u g h a comb ina t ion o f fu r the r w a g e b i l l adjustments t o

the res t ruc tu r ing o f utility sectors (powe r and water) t o reduce the cos ts o f d o i n g business and 

15 

im p r o v e access o f the poor to these essential p u b l i c services; (ii) sus ta in ing development and 
im p r o v e d managemen t o f the E th iop ia Djibouti transport in f ras t ruc tu re in support o f p o r t 
activities, the econom ic backbone f o r g r ow t h and employment; and (iii) voca t iona l t r a i n i n g t o 
enable l o c a l w o r k force take advantage o f sp i l love r ac t iv i t ies related t o the expansion o f the po r t . 

6.6 
B.1 Assistance in support of wage bill reduction and expenditure restructuring 
reform: A s h i g h l i g h t e d above (Section 11), the re la t ive size o f the p u b l i c wage b i l l in the budget 
i s too high, m o s t l y driven by an average high wage o f about 9 t imes the GDP pe r capita. This 
limits severely t h e fiscal r o o m t o hire m o r e teachers and hea l th professionals and t o p r o v i d e 
transfers and assistance to the poorest t o meet the PRSP and M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals. 
There are r e a l l y no other op t ions than t o t radeo f f high wages t o h i g h e r recruitment. This i s 
possible through the comb ina t ion o f res t ruc tu r ing (less o f adm in is t ra t ive and secu r i ty pe rsonne l 
and m o r e o f p u b l i c service professionals) l ow e r rea l wage leve ls th rough any p o l i t i c a l l y feasible 
comb ina t ion o f d i rec t n om i n a l wage cuts, and adjustment o f the exchange rate. In a d d i t i o n t o the 
direct effects o f this reform, these actions c o u l d also reduce business costs, enhancing growth 
th rough i m p r o v i n g competitiveness, and p r o v i d e f isca l space also f o r r a i s i n g inves tmen t and 
maintenance expenditures in the phys ica l in f ras t ruc tu re base, thereby reach ing and b e n e f i t i n g the 
p o o r b o t h d i r e c t l y and ind i rec t ly . 

6.7 

P lanned IDA assistance. On the analytical and technical side, IDA assistance w o u l d 
consist o f economic and sector wo rk and technical support cove r ing the c r i t i c a l aspects o f the 

wage b i l l res t ruc tu r ing reform. T h i s inc ludes a C E M based o n a series o f focused ana ly t ica l

lending side, IDA assistance w o u l d consist, under a high case scenario, of a second f isca l 

consolidation c red i t , suppo r t ing the second phase o f re fo rms unde r taken under the FCC , 
focusing o n wage b i l l and public expenditure restructuring.

B2. Restructuring the utilities sector as a means of enhancing competitiveness and

surtaxes6). I D A has played a leading ro le in assisting the Government in assessing the financial 
performance o f t h e power and water companies through the FCC. The two sector strategy notes 
o n power and water and PRSP wo rk have identified an action p lan fo r b o t h sectors focusing o n 
the fo l low ing key objectives: (i) imp rov ing the efficiency and f inanc ia l performance o f the 
u t i l i t i e s through restructuring and p romo t ion o f private sector participation; (ii) addressing key 
service-delivery constraints through rehabilitation o f networks and p ro tec t ion o f resources; and 
(iii) exp lo r ing n ew resources for water supply (e.g., desalination) and powe r generation (e.g., 
renewable energy and interconnection possibilities). 

Box 4: Competitiveness Indicators I n Djibouti 
H igh wages and high wage bilL An I M F survey was conducted to compare wage and price levels in Djibouti, Addis 
Ababa (Ethiopia) and Sana’a (Yemen). T h e survey revealed that Djibouti’s wages are much higher than those o f 
neighboring countries. A t 1999 exchange rates, wages in Djibouti were 3 to 6 % times the level o f those in Ethiopia 
and Yemen. T h e differentials were generally higher for skilled and semi-skilled employees (public servants, and hotel 
and restaurant staff) than for unskilled workers (manual laborers and domestic servants). The apparent insensitivity o f 
wage rates to the high level o f unemployment may reflect the benchmark established b y the dominant public sector, 
which accounts for approximately ha l f o f the total reported wage earner population (or almost three-quarters when 
public enterprises are included in the public sector). In 1998, the average wage rate in Djibouti’s c i v i l se rv ice was 
indeed about 45 percent above the average wage rate o f workers in the private sector and public enterprises. Estimated 
average salaries for public sector employees were more than five times the level in Ethiopia and about four times the 
level of comparable employees in Yemen. 
High utilities prices. Djibouti faces high production costs associated with u t i l i ty prices. In particular, the price o f the 
kW/hour for industries was about 26 cents in 2000, and the cost o f telephone calls abroad ranged from more than 
US$1 per minute to neighboring countries to almost US$3 per minute to Europe, and US$ 4 to the United States. 
Utilities are expensive primarily because o f high wages, a large tax burden, and poor management practices. When 
looking at public en te rp r ise accounts, i t appears that wages and salaries o f public enterprises range from 3 1 percent o f 
value added for Djibouti-Telecom, to 77 percent for the airport. T h e wage b i l l o f the electricity company was 5 1 
percent in 2000. Poor collection rates and fraud a re other problems faced b y some public enterprises, including the 
electricity and water company. 
H igh service prices. Higher prices o f transport contribute to the fact that road traffic between D j ibou t i and Ethiopia i s 
mostly handled b y Ethiopian companies, which pay lower wages to the i r drivers than those paid to D j ibou t i drivers. 
Other p r ices o f services (recreational, tailoring, shoe repairing, apartment rents) are much more expensive in Djibouti. 
As a result, the ratio o f non-tradable p r ices to tradable pr ices i s higher in D j ibou t i than in i ts two neighboring 
countries. 
High Real exchange rate (REER). Following the depreciation o f the U S dollar in effective terms, Djibouti’s real 
effective exchange rate depreciated between 2002 and 2004 b y about 30 percent. Despite t h i s depreciation the REER 
remained overvalued compared to the early 1990s (over 20 percent). Such an overvalued exchange rate continues to 
undermine the country’s overall competitiveness. 

6.9 
Planned IDA assistance would consist o f a dual power and water project. The I D A 
con t r ibu t ion towards this project i s expected to b e about US$7 million. In addition, a GEF grant 
towards renewable and energy e f f ic iency improvement i s being pursued and would be in the 
range o f US$2.5 to US$3.5 m i l l ion . The power sector-related components w o u l d inc lude a sma l l 
inves tmen t in the distribution network in D j i b o u t i -V i l l e to rehabilitate and extend the ne two rk t o 
un-served residential consumers, as we l l as to the commercial district; and the construction o f a 
small wind farm to se rve an in te r io r town. The water sector component w i l l focus o n i n i t i a t i n g 
protective measures o f the aquifer that se rves 70 percent o f D j ibou t i ’s population. However, 
although the Bank’s contribution to the c r i t ica l needs o f the water sector are limited due t o the 
constraints o f the IDA envelope, the Bank w i l l wo rk closely with the EU who i s preparing a 
large water sector investment project (US$20 m i l l i o n ) and has requested that i t s p ro jec t b e linked

to the Bank’s activities in te rms o f overall development objectives (see below under the 

ins t i tu t iona l component). Another component w i l l focus on the ins t i tu t iona l restructuring o f the 
power and water u t i l i t ies and the associated regulatory frameworks. 
IDA involvement in the 
sectors’ ins t i tu t iona l restructuring builds o n the wo rk undertaken under the FCC . In addition, the 
EU, the larges t donor in the water sector, has requested Bank leadership in sectoral reform, and 
i s conditioning the release o f i t s investment fbnds on the implementation o f reforms in the sector. 

Box 5: U t i l i t i e s ’ Unit Performance Compared to MNA’s Good Practice 
T h e price for electricity and water in D j ibou t i i s much higher than in other countries in the region, and 
also when compared to good general industry practice more generally. Average electricity tariffs in the 
region range from US#9ikWh to industry and US#6kWh to households in Yemen; U S # 6 kW h to 
industry and households in Jordan and US f6 .9kWh to industry and US#9 .5kWh to households in 
Morocco. In Djibouti, the average selling price i s US#20kWh, but commercial customers including 
small en te rp r ises pay as much as US#32/kWh and the Office National des Eaux de D j ibou t i (ONED) 
pays US .4 lkWh . The same applies to the water sector, where the lowest tariff to households reaches 
US#35 /m3 , compared to US#25/m3 in Yemen; US#22/m3 in Jordan, and US#20/m3in Morocco. Good 
practice in electricity i s an average ta r i f f o f between US#10-15kWh. I t i s more d i f f icu l t to have a 
benchmark for water s ince i t varies greatly w i th the source and amount o f water resources. 
T h e sectors also suffer from overstaffing, which i s o f serious concem, given the h igh cost o f labor in 
Djibouti. Measured in relationship to number o f connections, the D j ibou t i Electricity Authority (EDD) 
has 3 1 connections per employees whereas good practice i s 70- 100. Measured slightly differently for 
the water sector, ONED has 21 employees per active 1,000 connections, while good practice i s in the 
range o f 4 to 6. 

6.10 B3. Development and rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure in support of the 
Port of Djibouti as the engine of economic growth and employment: Djibouti has put the 
development o f the po r t and the transport sectors at the hea r t o f i t s pove r ty reduc t ion strategy. 
The potential o f the po r t as an engine o f g row th looks clearer today than in the mid-1990s when 
the po r t was los ing most o f i ts transshipment t ra f f ic to other competing ports in the region. The 
situation i s much imp roved today because o f the sharp increase in p o r t t ra f f ic f o l l ow i n g the 
Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998, combined with the rehabilitation o f the road link t o Ethiopia, 
wh ich was supported by IDA’S emergency Road Corridor Rehab i l i ta t ion Project and a 
supplemental credit, as we l l as the Government’s decision to transfer the po r t management to a 
private operator. This stimulated considerably port ac t iv i ty ( t ra f f ic increased by 165 percent 
be tween 1997 and 2002), and more than compensated fo r the drop in transshipment. 

6.11 The f i r s t challenge fo r D j i b o u t i i s to preserve the E th iop ian t r a n s i t t ra f f ic by improving 
the attractiveness and competitiveness o f the port, as well as i t s transportation log is t ica l l i n k s 
w i t h i t s hinterland. The second challenge i s to max im ize the port’s significant g row th and 
employment potential by regaining and expanding i t s share in transshipment and diversifying 
related business, inc lud ing a potential f ree trade zone (FTZ). 

6.12 
Improvement in b o t h physical infrastructure and the institutional setting are needed fo r 
the po r t o f D j i b o u t i to p lay i t s ro le as the gateway to and from i t s hinterland, especially vis-a-vis 
Ethiopia. Regarding the port, a new o i l terminal i s being built at the Do ra le site with private 
financing to alleviate the operational constraints posed by the o l d o i l fac i l i t ies in the current po r t 

site. 

6.13 A long-term plan to develop the D j ibou t i -Add is Ababa Co r r ido r started with the I D A - 
supported rehabilitation o f the D j ibou t i -Ga la f i road, encompassing also the development o f the 
r a i l link be tween Djibouti and Addis. The European U n i o n i s also f inanc ing a h ture improved 

18 

road link between D j i b o u t i and Addis Ababa, in addition to i t s financing o f emergency repairs to 
the r a i l link t o bring i t up to an acceptable l e v e l fo r efficient and safe operations. 

6.14 On the ins t i tu t iona l side, D j ibou t i ’s decision to have a partnership with the private sector 
in po r t and a i rpo r t management has been successful thus far, and lays the ground fo r more such 
partnerships. Preparation i s underway fo r a concession scheme fo r the r a i l link between D j i b o u t i 
and Addis Ababa through the privatization o f “Chemin de Fe r Djibouto-Ethiopien ”, a j o i n t - 
national company operating the 800-kilometer r a i l link be tween D j i b o u t i and Addis. 
Governments in b o t h countries n ow sponsor this scheme. 

Box 6: Development o f the Port o f Djibouti 

D j ibou t i has put the development o f the port and the transport sector at the heart o f its poverty reduction strategy. T h e potential 
of the port as an engine o f growth looks clearer today than in the m i d 1990s when the port was losing most o f its transshipment 
traffic to other competing ports in the region. T h e sharp increase in port traffic following the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 1998, 
combined with the rehabilitation o f the road link to Ethiopia, which was supported b y IDA’s emergency Road Corridor 
Rehabilitation Project and a supplemental credit, as well as the Government’s decision to transfer the port management to a 
private operator stimulated considerably port activity. Total port traffic rose to 5.97 m i l l ion tons in 2003, compared to 4.55 
m i l l ion tons in 2002 and solely 1.7 m i l l ion in 1997, which more than compensated for the drop in transshipment. The challenge 
for D j ibou t i i s to f i r s t preserve Ethiopian t rans i t t r a f i c b y improving the attractiveness and the competitiveness o f the port and its 
logistics links w i th its hinterland, and then to seek to diversify the port’s business. 

Strengthening the competitiveness of theport of Djibouti and logistics links with its hinterland. Improvement o f both physical 

infrastructure and institutional settings i s needed for the port o f D j ibou t i to play its role as the gate to and from its hinterland, and 
mainly Ethiopia. On t h e port side, a new o i l terminal i s being bu i l t at Dorale site w i th private financing to alleviate the current 
operational constraints posed by the old o i l facilities in the current port site. A long-term plan to develop the Djibouti-Addis 
Corridor started w i th the IDA ’s supported rehabilitation o f the Djibouti-Galafi road and i t also encompasses development o f the 
ra i l link between D j ibou t i and Addis. T h e European Union i s financing a future improved road link between D j ibou t i and Addis 
Ababa along the same route as the existing ra i l link via Ali-Sabieh in D j ibou t i and Dire-Dawa in Ethiopia. The E U i s also 
financing emergency repairs to the ra i l link to bring i t up to an acceptable level for efficient and safe operations. On the 
institutional side, Djibouti’s decision to have a partnership w i th the private sector in port management was so far successful and i t 
lays the ground for more such partnerships. Preparation i s underway o f a concession scheme for the ra i l link between D j ibou t i 
and Addis through the privatization o f “Chemin de F e r D j ibou to -E th iop ien (CFDE) ”, a joint-national company operating the 
800-kilometer ra i l link between D j ibou t i and Addis. T h i s scheme i s now sponsored b y Governments in both countries. A 
national road strategy aimed at improving the institutional arrangements o f the road sector including road management and 
financing o f road maintenance i s being carried out under the emergency road corridor rehabilitation project. T h i s CAS proposes 
support in this area through a Partial Risk Guarantee in support o f the concession to the privatization o f the CFDE, and a 
transport strategy study. 
Diversifying the port’s business and related activities. T h e Government and the private operator o f the port have set as a 
strategic goal to increase Djibouti’s share in the very competitive regional transshipment traffic. T h e construction w i th private 
participation o f a new deepwater container terminal at Dorale s i te along w i th an industrial and commercial free zone i s on their 
agenda. W h i l e the activities o f this proposed port are rather capital than labor intensive, a successful f ree zone should be a 
significant source o f employment. I f this ambitious project d id materialize, for i t to benefit the economic and social development 
of the country, special attention should be focused to train a qualified labor force on one hand, and to reduce t h e extremely h igh 
cost o f labor in Djibouti on the other hand. T h i s CAS supports address the first area through the proposed Partial Risk Guarantee. 

6.15 Planned IDA assistance w o u l d cons is t o f an I D A p a r t i a l r isk guarantee, w h i c h cou ld b e 
matched by t h e same amount f rom E th iop ia w i th which coordination i s under way, to the

c. ALIGNMENT TO THE PRSP PILLAR OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY 
ALLEVIATION 

6.16 The focus o f the previous CAS o n human development was also aligned with what 
subsequently became the second pillar o f the PRSP. This CAS continues IDA support in the 
same area covered in the previous CAS w i t h additional lending except in health, where two 
operations (Health Sec tor Development; and H IV /A IDS ) have just s tar ted and their 
implementation should cover the required IDA support in this sector over the next four years. 

6.17 C1. Continuing support for an accelerated school access and improvement agenda: 
The f i r s t phase o f D j ibou t i ’s School Access and Improvement Adaptable Program Lending 
(APL), the f i r s t IDA project in education, i s being completed one year ahead o f schedule with 
significant and encouraging resu l ts in several areas: (i) increased enrollment with a primary gross 
enrollment ra t io (GER) o f 52 percent compared to 39.5 percent at the s ta r t o f the project in 2000; 
(ii) decreased grade repeater rates f rom 10 percent to 7 percent; (iii) increased ava i lab i l i ty o f 
textbook at a ra t io o f 1:l; (iv) increased 
teacher training; (v) rev ised curriculum; and (vi) 
achievement o f a l l the triggers agreed upon to move the second Phase o f the APL. 

6.18 P lanned IDA assistance w o u l d consist o f a second accelerated school access and 

improvement p ro jec t fo r the second phase of 

the education APL. The objectives o f this p ro jec t 
are to expand coverage o f qua l i ty basic education through targeted activities which contribute t o 
increased access and retention rates o f the system, and to further reduce repe t i t ion and drop-out 
rates. The specific objective o f this phase i s to increase the enrollment t o 70 percent by 2008, 
with special emphasis on girls education, in l i n e with the PRSP targets. IDA w i l l w o r k closely 
with other donors to mob i l ize additional financial resources fo r reaching this target. An 
Education Sector Strategy Assessmen t w i l l be prepared in FY07. 

6.19 C2. Continuing support fo r employment generation and direct support to the poor: 
With respect to employment generation and social development, the last CAS p rog ram consisted 
o f the consolidation and expansion o f a Social Development and Pub l ic Wo rks Program. The 
program contributed to poverty reduction through: (i) construction and rehab i l i ta t ion o f social 
and economic infrastructure in the poorest neighborhoods with a direct impact o n the living 
conditions o f the poor (such as street works, drainage, water and sanitation systems, 
loca l 
markets, schools, and health care facilities), while at the same time, o f fe r ing employment 
opportunities; (ii) supporting commun i ty development through social mob i l iza t ion programs and 
inves tmen t g r a n t s for the creation o f commun i ty facilities; and (iii) ins t i tu t iona l capacity building 
by developing the capability o f small loca l p r iva te contractors to enable them to bene f i t f r om 
opportunities offered by the po r t development, the military bases and other activities; and also 
imp rov ing the institutional capacity o f the Government, communities and NGOs to design and 
implement poverty reduction interventions. 

6.20 One o f the m a i n factors characterizing the unemployment situation in D j i b o u t i i s the lack 
o f basic skilled labor and the lack o f t ra in ing to address this problem. Addressing th is 
impediment to employment wou ld enable labor force to better take advantage o f ex is t ing and 
potential se rv ice activities developments, in particular that o f construction and other services 
related to the military bases, and transport related to the port, as well as t o the po ten t ia l demand 
f r om i t s ongoing expansion and possible f ree zone development. 

20 

6.21 P lanned IDA assistance wou ld consist o f a credit focused o n employment creation with 

tw o components: (i) rehabilitation o f basic se rv ices (in particular water and sewerage system) in 

one o f the poorest districts (the Cartier Dariba); and (ii) financing o f a sma l l focused Vocational 
T ra in ing project to enable unemployed young people to take advantage o f expected employment 
opportunities linked to the development o f the port. IDA support w i l l continue in the area o f 
pension system reform (under the Planned second Fiscal Consolidation Credit) and an 
employment strategy note (CEM). 

6.22 C3. Providing support to poor victims o f the flood: The PRSP highlights the 
vu lne rab i l i ty o f D j i b o u t i to various natural disaster dangers and emphasizes need fo r developing 
prevention and management capacity. An Emergency Floods Rehab i l i ta t ion project fo r $6.4 
m i l l i o n was approved in September 2004 to assist the Government o f D j i b o u t i in helping people 
hurt by t h e floods that devastated the reg ion in April 2004, that impacted about 15 percent o f the 
population, o r about 100,000 people. M o s t o f the affected popu la t ion l i v e s in the poorest areas. 
Support w i l l be given to rehabilitate social and economic infrastructure (e.g., housing, schools, 
medical centers) that was damaged. The project also includes technical assistance to support 
short and long - te rm disaster prevention management plans. 

6.23 C4. Providing support in other key problematic social areas: As identified above 
(paras. 1.10-1-14), women in D j i b o u t i bear additional disadvantages and bu rden that the PRSP 
recognize as key hurdles in the way o f uplifting the we l l being o f the who le society. The PRSP, 
however, does no t deal adequately with the Qat issue, because the re i s less internal consensus 
about the problem. 
IDA assistance under the CAS program will, never the less , address b o t h 

issues . 

6.24 Planned IDA assistance to furthering the gender agenda: The UNDP and U N F P A are 
providing assistance to the Ministry o f Gender, ma in ly in capacity building. The IDA - f inanced 
Social Development and Public Works project p rov ided credit to micro-enterprises, many o f 
wh ich a re run by women. The Planned new Social Development and Pub l ic Wo rks I1 credit 
wou ld fo l low step. The f i r s t School Access and Improvement p ro jec t under the previous CAS 
has met i t s exp l ic i t targets fo r reducing the gender gap in schooling. The second School Access 
project, under this CAS w i l l further a id in this e f fo r t with s t i l l greater emphasis o n girls 
schooling. The Hea l th project, currently under implementation, also aims at reducing the high 
rates o f infant and matemal mo r ta l i ty . A coordinated e f fo r t w i l l b e made with donors to support 
NGOs in the on-going pub l ic awareness and education campaign f o r the e l im ina t ion o f FGM 
practice. 

6.25 Planned I D A assistance to address the Qat problem: IDA efforts w i l l a im at building 
consensus in the country o n the importance o f this i s s u e in terms o f i t s serious social and 
economic consequences. An assessment o f the social and economic imp l ica t ions o f Qat impo r t 
and consumption at the household and macro leve ls w i l l be made within the framework o f the 
programmed wo rk o n pove r ty assessment. 
IDA w i l l raise the i s s u e mo re p rom inen t ly in i t s 
p o l i c y dialogue with the authorities. IDA w i l l j o i n other donors in the e f fo r t o f ra is ing awareness 
about the ha rm fu l effects o f Qat consumption and p rov ide support t o na t iona l in i t ia t ives to 
address this problem.

D. ALIGNMENT TO THE PRSP PILLAR OF PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE 

6.26 T h e PRSP emphasizes governance imp rovemen t as one o f the m a i n p i l l a r s o f 
deve lopmen t and p o v e r t y reduction. In this agenda, governance imp rovemen t i s de f ined b r o a d l y

6.27 Two key I D A f iduc ia ry activities, a CFAA and a CPAR, have been f ina l ized in add i t ion t o 
a Pub l ic Expenditure Review. These constitute a s t rong basis f o r i d e n t i f y l n g imp rovemen t areas 
and a concrete p r o g r am o f actions that the authorities are willing t o unde r take t o m o v e f o rw a r d

E. LENDING SCENAR IOS AND TRIGGERS 
6.31 The base-case lending program of about US$31 million w i l l fully utilize Djibouti’s 
IDA indicative allocation for the next four years*. The base case i s predicated o n continued 
satisfactory macroeconomic management and good po r t fo l io performance. The CAS does no t 
envisage a low case scenario because of: i) negligible p robab i l i ty o f base case triggers no t being 
met; (ii) the small size o f IDA allocation in the base case; and (iii) t h e rema in ing lending 
program beyond FY05 i s essen t ia l ly in education and poverty alleviation. The alternative 
lending case scenario i s thus limited to a high case scenario. 

6.32 The high case lending scenario would provide for US$9 million above the base case 
I t w o u l d consist o f a pove r ty reduction credit in support o f scaling up the f isca l consolidation 
agenda started during the last CAS with a F isca l Consolidation C red i t (FCC). The second FCC 
w i l l focus on public expenditure restructuring with emphasis on the wage b i l l (structure o f c i v i l 
service and wage l e v e l adjustment) with the objectives, as h igh l igh ted above o f : (i) creating 
needed fiscal room for higher pub l ic service spending, (ii) im p r o v i n g income d is t r ibu t ion and 
direct t rans fe rs to the poor; and (iii) enhancing ove ra l l competitiveness o f the economy. The 
triggers fo r the high case scenario w o u l d consist of: satisfactory IDA p o r t f o l i o performance with 
no more than two p rob lem projects in the po r t fo l io ; satisfactory progress in imp lemen ta t ion o f 

’ Out o f the project cost o f USS6.4 million, $3.2 m i l l ion i s in the fo rm o f a grant, and an equal amount i s in the fo rm o f an I D A

F. IDA LENDING TERMS AND DJIBOUTI’S INFLATED GNI PER CAPITA 

6.33 D j ibou t i G N I p e r capita of US$920 has became higher than the operational cutoff for 
eligibility for 40-year IDA funding of US$S95 over the past three years. T h i s high l e v e l o f GNI 
pe r capita in do l la r terms i s t o a la rge extent a r t i f i c i a l l y i n f l a t e d by the ove rva lued exchange rate. 
I t does n o t re f lec t the extent o f p r e v a i l i n g p o v e r t y in D j i b o u t i as h i g h l i g h t e d above. Un less the 
Government addresses the unde r l in ing factors o f i t s i n f l a t e d GNI p e r capita, i t w i l l dep r ive 
Djibouti f r o m the needed IDA softer terms. This i s in add i t ion t o the b e n e f i c i a l im p l i c a t i o n that 
such p o l i c y r e f o rm c o u l d have in co r rec t ing the income d i s t r i b u t i o n b ias against the p o o r as 
discussed in section 11. 

G. COORDINATION W ITH DEVELOPMENT 

PARTNERS 

6.34 Quite in contrast with the improvement in IDA portfolio performance and dialogue 
with the Government, many partners express frustration about dijjficult policy dialogue and 
slow project implementation. Several la rge and c r i t i c a l p ro jec ts have been in the p ipe l ine f o r a 
l o n g t im e w i t h o u t ma te r ia l iz ing . P o r t f o l i o pe r fo rmance i s also un -even across partners. T h i s 
underscores the need t o assess donors’ co l lec t ive experience with D j i b o u t i and share lessons o f 
wha t has w o r k e d w e l l and wha t did n o t as the donors c omm u n i t y prepares t o p ledge i t s fu tu re 
assistance t o D j i b o u t i ’ s PRSP during the Consu l ta t ive G roup (CG) mee t ings t o b e o rgan ized th is 
summer. 

6.35 
Th e PRSP preparation and consultation process, i n which donors were associated, 
offered a good opportunity for a shared understanding of 
the Government strategy and 
priorities. Th rough i t s PRSP, D j i b o u t i has i t s f i r s t comprehensive and consistent v i s i o n and 
strategy o f development and p o v e r t y reduc t ion since independence. T h e PRSP processes l e d 
donors t o start re focus ing the i r assistance o n a m o r e i n f o rm e d basis a long the Gove rnmen t 
p r io r i t ies . The process has also fo rced the s ta r t o f a m o r e ac t ive coo rd ina t ion among the dono r 
commun i ty w h i c h shou ld i n t e n s i f y at the Consu l ta t ive G roup m e e t i n g tha t w o u l d b e cha i red by 
the W o r l d Bank. IDA would w o r k w i th dono r agencies t o ensure that: (i) p o l i c y o r i n s t i t u t i o n a l 

24 

advise i s m u t u a l l y consistent; (ii) investment programs addressing the p r io r i t ies o f the PRSP are 
consistent and d o no t overlap; (iii) donors share sectoral and economic analysis and information; 
and (iv) IDA and donors operational procedures (e.g., for procurement, accounting, and audit) 
are as standardized as possible to ease project implementation. 

6.36 

This CAS, prepared in close collaboration with the donor community, i s designed to 
complement and support other donors’ effort. 

(see section VI-A). I t specifically arranged some 
o f the lending and non-lending operations to address problems that constrain other donors 
support (as i s the case with the water and power project for example) and use any comparative 
advantage IDA m igh t have to help in this regard. As shown in the CAS resu l ts ma t r ix (Annex 
B9) there are already many syne rg ies between IDA assistance and other donors’ proposed 
interventions. These w i l l be further c la r i f ied as donors’ consultation on de f in ing respective 
assistance to the PRSP investment program progress. 

6.37 
M o r e specifically, the W o r l d Bank w i l l continue i t s strong collaboration w i th the IMF 
and w i l l ensure that a consistent message i s conveyed on the macroeconomic, pub l ic finance 
management and other structural reforms. The planned second Fiscal Consolidation Credit 
(FCC) w o u l d reinforce and complement the IMF’s potential PRGF p rog ram as i t was the case 
with the f i r s t FCC . O n other areas, such as in the water, power, and transport sectors, IDA’S 
assistance b o t h in lending and in analytical (AAA) w o r k i s being prepared in close collaboration 
with the EU and complements i t s investment and assistance in sector re fo rms as we l l as the 
AfDB’s intervention in the energy sector. The Bank i s also supporting in -coun t ry a id 
coordination l e d by other donors through sector-level technical assistance (e.g., D j i b o u t i 
education loca l donor group led by France). There i s also close collaboration w i th the UN, the 

Cuisse F runca ise de Developpement and other donors in imp rov ing Govemance. 

V I I . MANAGING 

THE R I S K S 

7.1 

T h e realization of Djibouti’s pove rv reduction strategy, and the effectiveness of 
this 
CAS which is aligned to it, are subject to several external and in te rna l risks. The PRSP 

recognized up f ron t most o f these r i s k s . 

7.2 

Djibouti’s exposure to external risk i s h igh because its economy depends mainly on the 
po r t and its development; the rental of m i l i ta ly bases; and grants and soft f inanc ing from 
donors-all of which are subject to high geo-political uncertainties. Regarding the port, the 

surge in g row th since the mid-1990s o f p o r t activities w i th E th iop ia was attributable to the 
E t h i o p i f i r i t r e a war, and subsequent reliance o f E th iop ia o n the D j i b o u t i port fo r mos t o f i t s 
imports and exports. T o limit the r i s k o f the reve rs ib i l i ty o f the increase in i t s share in E th iop ia 
trade traffic, D j i b o u t i needs to improve the ove ra l l competitiveness o f the po r t by reducing costs, 
and imp rov ing infrastructure l i n k s (road and railways) to Ethiopia. In t h i s respect, the on -go ing 
effort to expand transport infrastructure with direct f inanc ia l pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the E th iop ian s ide 
raises the stakes o f the latter in maintaining continuous bus iness and limits this risk. A s f o r the 
prospective development and expansion o f port as a transshipment hub, i t i s s t i l l awa i t ing the 
conclusion o f a deal with a foreign private investor. The ren ta l o f the newest military bases (the 
U S and Germany bases) wh ich constitutes an impo r tan t additional source o f revenue to the 
Government and influences the development o f m a n y service activities, i s also subject to 
unpredictability, even though more in the longer te rm than in the near term , given the con t inu ing 
regional ins tab i l i ty in the Middle East. 

25 

7 . 3 

Th e f inanc ing of 
the PRSP investment program hinges on important contributions 
from donors in the form of grants, which, if not forthcoming in the amounts envisaged, could 
jeopardize f isca l sustainability and/or the PRSP investment p rog ram . T h i s risk and i t s effects 

w i l l b e h o p e f u l l y adequately addressed by D j i b o u t i ’ s partners during the planned Consu l ta t ive 
G roup M e e t i n g in support o f the PRSP. D j i b o u t i w o u l d m i t iga te th is r i s k s ign i f ican t ly by 
addressing i t s s t ruc tu ra l adjustment r e f o rm t o boost confidence o f i t s partners in the effectiveness 
o f the i r support and foreign investors o n the competitiveness and l o n g t e rm economic, soc ia l and 
p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty o f the country. 

7 .4 

CAS implementation i s also subject to two major internal risks. F i rs t , there i s the risk 
that the Government may move too slowly or not at a l l with respect to the next phase offiscal 

consolidation and restructuring. F a i l i n g t o take these decisions and im p l em e n t i n g such re fo rms 
w o u l d shed m o r e unce r ta in ty o n the attainment o f the PRSP objectives in terms o f basic service 
d e l i v e r y and be t te r income and ren t d is t r ibu t ion . I t w o u l d also de lay the necessary adjustments 
needed t o im p r o v e competitiveness and thus deter po ten t ia l FDI, and d im i n i s h dono r support. 
The envisaged high-case scenario lending (FCC 11) w o u l d p rov ide , a l o n g with expected la rge r 
support f r o m D j i b o u t i ’ s other partners, b o t h techn ica l and f inanc ia l assistance t o h e l p w i t h e r 
d o w n the soc ia l costs o f th is reform, and enhance i t s soc ia l and p o l i t i c a l feas ib i l i ty . 

7.5 

Th e other source of 
internal risk i s related to the capacity to implement and monitor 
Djibouti’s poverty reduction strategy, which implies a large increase in the pub l ic investment 
program in a situation of relatively low skill levels and limited administrative and management 

capacity. The risk i s no t s ign i f ican t with rega rd t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S p rog ram 
(section V). 
Howeve r , 
the 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity constraints can p o t e n t i a l l y limit the 
Government’s a b i l i t y to u t i l i z e fully and e f fec t ive ly increased support f r o m o the r donors. IDA 
w i l l keep this broader issue unde r review.

** Djibouti's portfolio has no unsatisfactory project and no problem projects. The 
percentage of project at risk is driven by only one project-specific risk flag for 
two of the projects in the portfolio. This one risk flag triggers the qualifier 
problem project as it adds to the two automatic country risk flags (Country 
Environment and Country Records Risk Flags). The problems are being 
actively dealt with and shall be resolved on time.
