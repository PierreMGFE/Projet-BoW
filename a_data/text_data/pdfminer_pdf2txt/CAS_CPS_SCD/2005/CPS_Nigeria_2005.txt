NIGERIA AT A TURNING POINT 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A National Comprehensive Framework for Reform, Growth and Poverty Reduction. In M a y 2004, 

N ige r ia launched i t s strategy f o r g row th and poverty reduction, the Na t iona l Econom ic Empowermen t 
and Deve lopmen t Strategy (NEEDS) and the state-level State Econom ic Empowermen t and 
Development Strategy (SEEDS). The NEEDS i s based on three p i l lars : (i) empower ing people and 
imp rov ing soc ia l service de l ivery , (ii) g row ing the pr iva te sector and focus ing o n non -o i l growth, and 
(iii) changing the way government works and imp rov ing governance. Over the past tw o years, 
N ige r ia has made good progress imp lemen t ing key reforms, pa r t icu la r ly in macroeconomic 
management and the fight against corruption. 

A development challenge of global significance. Despite the re fo rm efforts, N ige r ia s t i l l faces 

s ign i f ican t challenges in accelerating growth, reducing pover ty and mee t ing the M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals (MDGs). N ige r ia i s A f r ica ’s most populous country, but 70 m i l l i o n o f i t s 
popu la t ion l ives in poverty. On ly Ch ina and Ind ia have more poor people. Lagos State, just one o f 
N iger ia ’s 36 states, i s larger than each o f 32 A f r ican countries. A f r ica ’s attainment o f the MDGs 
depends on N iger ia ’s success. 

Nigeria’s reform efforts and development challenges need strong international support. Even w i t h 

recent high o i l prices, N iger ia ’s shor t fa l l in development f inanc ing remains large. N ige r ia receives 
on ly US$2 per capita in O f f i c i a l Deve lopmen t Assistance (ODA) compared to an A f r i c a n average o f 
US$28 and faces negative ne t transfers o f US$1.3 b i l l i o n annually, g iven curren t levels o f debt 
servicing. Yet, s ign i f ican t pub l ic f inanc ing i s needed to ease the economy’s enormous infrastructure 
needs and make progress in human development. N ige r ia w i l l requ ire a marked increase in external 
a id in f lows - through increased IDA and DFID assistance, and debt r e l i e f - t o be able to unleash 
g row th and meet key MDGs. 

World Bank Group / DFZD Partnership. The W o r l d Bank G roup and DFID recogn ize that N ige r ia i s 
at a turning po in t , one that requires a significant, consistent response f r o m the in terna t iona l 
community. Responding t o the Paris Dec lara t ion o f 2005, the t w o organizations a i m t o continue to 
build a successful partnership in support o f a coun try- led approach to g row th and pove r ty reduction. 
The W o r l d Bank Group and DFID a im to broaden this partnership - inc lud ing w i t h the UN, other 
mu l t i la tera ls and bilaterals - to increase donor harmon iza t ion and enhance a id effectiveness. 
The Strategy. The CPS proposes to step up f inanc ia l and technical assistance t o s igna l strong support 
fo r the Government’s r e f o rm e f for ts and he lp finance investment necessary t o remove obstacles to 
g row th and development. The CPS proposes specific ac t iv i t ies to support the Federa l Government and 
selected we l l-per form ing states (lead states), and targeted MDG - re la ted ac t ion elsewhere. W o r k w i t h 
the Federal Government w i l l be in fou r areas: (i) f inanc ing investments in in fras truc ture (especially 
power, gas infrastructure and transport); (ii) f inanc ia l and technical support t o imp rove accountability 
and transparency and to fight corruption; (iii) technical assistance and adv isory services on investment 
c l ima te and po l ic ies to stimulate pr iva te sector led grow th ; and ( iv ) support t o na t iona l in i t ia t ives fo r 
human development, pa r t icu la r ly those a imed at fighting H I V / A ID S , strengthening the hea l th system 
and supporting the know ledge economy. 

In lead states, f inanc ia l and technical assistance w i l l seek t o leverage state e f fo r t and resources to 
boost economic ac t iv i ty and imp rove social service de l ivery . State in terven t ions w i l l be designed to 
support state development strategies and w i l l he lp create a mode l o f g r ow t h and development that can 
be scaled up. In i t ia l ly , the W o r l d Bank and DFID propose t o wo rk in up t o s ix lead states, chosen on

N ige r ia 

the basis o f the i r governments’ commitment to reforms - especially in the area o f budget and f inanc ia l 
management, transparency and fighting corruption. 

In the rema in ing states, the strategy i s to impac t more d i rec t ly o n the l ives o f poo r people and their 
access to soc ia l and produc t ive infrastructure, goods and services. Focused programs w i l l wo rk w i t h a 
range o f stakeholders - in close cooperation w i t h UN agencies and others - on specific MDG - re la ted 
issues, such as girls’ education, maternal health, rou t ine immun iza t ion o r access t o safe water. An 
impor tan t aspect o f wo rk in these states w i l l be to strengthen voice and demand f o r change among 
service users and communities. 

A d is t inc t ive feature o f the CPS strategy i s the variety o f aid instruments i t w i l l be able t o o f fe r at 
d i f feren t levels o f intervention. 
Interventions at the federal leve l w i l l con t inue to be predom inan t ly 
Specific Inves tmen t L o a n ( S I L ) projects. Lead states w i l l be able to access a “performance package”, 
a more programmatic, cross-sectoral approach to bo th ana ly t ica l wo rk and financing, d raw ing in bo th 
IDA and DFID resources. I t i s foreseen that Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP)-type operations w i l l 
emerge fo r the lead states. With increased accountability and e f f ic iency o f pub l ic expenditures across 
a l l levels o f government, i t i s expected that the basis fo r using budget support instruments in some 
lead states w i l l b e established p r io r to the end o f this CPS pe r iod (a l though budget support i s no t 
anticipated during th is CPS period). In other states, support w i l l target d irec t impac t o n the l ive l ihoods 
o f poor people through na t iona l ly designed Commun i ty D r i v e n Deve lopmen t (CDD)- type projects in 
the social and produc t ive sectors and MDG - re la ted programming, pa r t icu la r ly through the UN, c i v i l 
society and the pr iva te sector. B o t h at the federal and state level, the CPS w i l l he lp strengthen 
dialogue between Government and c i v i l society and build coa l i t ions o n economic reforms, 
transparency and accountability. 

The CPS resonates w i t h key elements o f the A f r i c a Comm iss ion report, inc lud ing i t s support fo r 
pr iva te sector g row th and i t s emphasis on new investments in infrastructure, agr icu l ture and human 
development. The CPS’s push fo r increased resource f lows to N ige r ia i s also in l i n e w i t h the 
Commission’s repor t fo r increased resource f lows t o A f r ica , inc lud ing through debt re l ie f . 

Risks. N iger ia ’s reformers have the necessary po l i t ica l w i l l and a broadening consensus and 
constituency f o r sustaining change. However, g iven N iger ia ’s history, today’s r e f o rm e f for ts are high 
r i s k hence the W o r l d Bank ’s and DFID’s strong comm i tmen t to p rov ide support to N ige r ia in i t s 
e f for ts to sustain reforms wh i le m i t iga t ing r i s k s . A key risk i s that the po l i t ica l landscape and 
comm i tmen t to re fo rm may shift, par t icu lar ly after the 2007 elections. The CPS w i l l support 
Government in comp le t ing the reforms i t has initiated, and support N ige r ian c i v i l society in 
strengthening i t s capacity to demand change o n accountability, transparency and service de l ivery . 
The in terna t iona l commun i ty can also he lp pro tec t against the eros ion o f gains b y p rov id ing greater 
mo ra l and f inanc ia l support t o N iger ia . G iven N iger ia ’s re l iance on o i l , i t w i l l n o t be free f r o m the 
risk o f strong negative external shocks. N ige r ia i s curren t ly building up reserves to smooth i t s 
expenditure p ro f i le and sustain g row th in the longer-term. The Government has b u i l t a strong 
relationship w i t h the IMF o n macroeconomic management that w i l l he lp m i t iga te r i s k s associated 
w i t h external economic shocks.

I. A N OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS 

1. 
N ige r ia ’s current po l i t ica l and economic transformation provides an oppor tun i ty to assist 
A f r ica ’s mos t populous na t ion to turn i t s economy around to achieve sustained economic and social 
development. N ige r ia i s a reg iona l giant; a g row ing and prosperous N ige r ia m o v i n g towards 
ach iev ing the MDGs wou ld translate to gains in social and economic progress f o r the who le region. 
However , the challenges fac ing N iger ia ’s reformers are form idab le and success i s n o t assured. T o 
enhance the chances for success: (i) the imp lemen ta t ion and support fo r re forms need to continue; this 
wou ld be strengthened i f reformers are able to show early results; and (ii) the in terna t iona l commun i ty 
needs to ensure that Nigeria’s economic p rog ram i s adequately financed. This w o u l d requ ire an 
increase in new commitments and a reso lu t ion o f Nigeria’s debt problem. 

Political and Economic Reforms in Nigeria 

2. 
In April 2003, N ige r ia successfully he ld i t s second consecutive na t iona l elections, fur ther 
conso l ida t ing the transition f r om m i l i ta ry to democratic c i v i l i a n ru le that began in 1999. Ins t i tu t ions 
and mechanisms for accountability and good governance are be ing strengthened; a v ib ran t press and 
c i v i l society groups are emerging and ga in ing strength. Na tura l ly , after more than three decades o f 
m i l i ta ry dictatorship, N iger ia ’s democracy remains fragile; and ethnic and re l ig ious tensions f l a r e up 
f r o m t ime t o time. The nex t Presidential elections are scheduled f o r 2007 and President Obasanjo w i l l 
no t run. M u c h therefore depends o n whether his successor w i l l continue to imp lemen t the ongo ing 
po l i t ica l and economic reforms. 

3. 
N ige r ia i s ga in ing respect and in terna t iona l standing as a leader in A f r ica . President Obasanjo 
has become Cha i r o f the A f r ican U n i o n (AU). N ige r ia has become a lead ing p laye r in the 
Commonwealth, in the N ew Partnership f o r A fr ica ’s Deve lopmen t (NEPAD), in the Econom ic 
Commun i ty o f West A f r ican States (ECOWAS ) and p lays an impor tan t ro le in peacekeeping 
throughout A f r ica . 

4. 
Econom ic reforms are ga in ing momentum. 
The second Obasanjo adm in is tra t ion has 
assembled a h igh ly competent, professional group o f reformers that i s imp lemen t ing po l ic ies to: (i) 
strengthen governance and fight corruption, (ii) g row the p r iva te sector; and, (iii) empower peop le and 
imp rove soc ia l service de l ivery . The process i s slow and gradual, g iven the dep th o f ins t i tu t iona l 
deterioration caused b y years o f mismanagement and rampant corruption. However , the Government 
i s show ing strong resolve, and re fo rm imp lemen ta t ion i s generally on track. 

5 . 

Po l icy imp lemen ta t ion in 2004 signaled a clear break f r o m past practices and, in particular, a 
break f r om a 30-year h is tory o f uncon tro l led booms and busts cycles caused b y o i l p r ice fluctuations. 
Macroeconomic po l icy imp lemen ta t ion was commendable. F o r the f i r s t time, N ige r ia successfully 
implemented a f isca l ru le de - l ink ing the budget f r om current o i l prices. A l l three tiers o f government 
prepared the ir budgets based o n an o i l pr ice o f US$25 a barrel, and in e f fec t s ter i l ized a s ign i f ican t 
po r t ion (about US$6 b i l l ion ) o f the o i l w ind fa l l . Prudent f isca l po l icy , comp lemen ted b y tight 
monetary po l icy , a l lowed the Government t o achieve the key objectives o f i t s 2004 program, name ly 
t o restore macroeconomic stability, enhance p red ic tab i l i ty and transparency o f po l ic ies and reduce the 
economy’s vu lne rab i l i ty to o i l p r ice shocks. 

6. 
Real GDP i s estimated to have g rown about 6%, the consolidated government f isca l surplus 
rose to 10% o f GDP on a cash basis, compared to balance in 2003, annual i n f l a t i o n decelerated 
sharply f r om 24% at end 2003 to about 10% at end 2004, no tw i ths tand ing increases in pr ices o f fue l 
products fo l low ing progress on deregulation and l ibe ra l iza t ion o f the downs tream pe t ro leum sector. 

Country Partnersh ip Strategy

N ige r ia 

Para l le l improvemen t in N iger ia ’s 
terms o f trade strengthened N iger ia ’s ex terna l position: 
in terna t iona l reserves rose t o US$17 b i l l ion , equivalent to 6.5 months o f impo r ts pro jec ted fo r 2005l. 

7. 
N ige r ia has also made good progress in imp rov ing governance and transparency and fighting 
corruption. First, the budget i s more transparent; allocations are w ide ly published, so that citizens can 
better h o l d o f f ic ia ls accountable. Second, a “Due Process” Unit in the Presidency ensures that pub l ic 
money cannot be disbursed fo r investment unless procurement procedures have been respected. 
Third, the Government has made an impressive s t a r t on imp lemen t ing the Ex t rac t ive Industries 
Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI), setting an example across A f r ica . Among other things, full audits o f 
o i l sector accounts f o r the last three years wou ld be available before end-2005. Four th , the Econom ic 
and F inanc ia l Cr imes Comm iss ion (EFCC) i s successfully pursuing co r rup t o f f ic ia ls . 
Indeed, the 
Government has begun 2005 w i t h an in tens i f ied e f fo r t on the fight against co r rup t ion and t w o Federal 
M in is ters have recen t ly been removed. 

8. 
The focus over the last 18 months has r igh t ly been on macro-s tab i l iza t ion and better 
governance. Howeve r the Government i s n ow pay ing more a t ten t ion t o s truc tura l constraints to 
g row th and soc ia l development. N ew in i t ia t ives in the social sectors in the Federa l Government’s 
2005 budget inc lude : (i) increased funding fo r the Un ive rsa l Bas ic Educa t ion program; (ii) a 
na t ionw ide feed ing program in basic schools; (iii) a special p rog ram t o encourage girl’s pr imary 
education; and, ( iv ) a new p rog ram fo r accelerated achievement o f Hea l th MDGs. The President has 
also launched a renewed e f fo r t on safe water. Ac t ions to encourage p r iva te sector g row th include: (i) 
unbundling o f the power parastatal ahead o f divestiture, passing a landmark Powe r B i l l t o underp in 
and accelerate transformation o f the e lec tr ic i ty sector; (ii) leg is la t ing t o p romo te development o f the 
domestic gas sector; (iii) l ibe ra l iz ing the downstream pe tro leum sector; ( iv ) re-starting the 
pr iva t iza t ion o f the telecommunications parastatal NITEL; and, (v) increas ing funding t o address key 
infrastructure constraints. 

9 . 
Leg is la t ion i s be ing put in place to make re forms more d i f f i c u l t t o reverse. K e y elements 
include: a F isca l Respons ib i l i ty B i l l fo r a l l tiers o f government that enshrines the o i l -p r ice based 
f isca l ru le and best practice in f isca l transparency, coord ina t ion and mon i to r ing ; a Procurement B i l l to 
make pub l ic procurement compe t i t ive and more open; and an EITI b i l l t o ma in ta in transparency o f o i l 
revenues. 

10. 
N iger ia ’s economic ou t look in 2005 is , on balance, pos i t ive . On the macroeconomic front, i f 
the current pace o f re fo rm i s maintained, rea l GDP i s pro jec ted t o g row at about 7% o n the basis o f 
h igher crude o i l and gas produc t ion and non -o i l GDP g row th o f about 5%. The ex terna l current 
account surplus i s expected t o w iden and gross in tema t iona l reserves t o increase b y about US$17 
b i l l ion . There are nevertheless some short-term risks. O i l and gas ou tpu t c o u l d be a f fec ted b y social

N ige r ia ’s re fo rm e f for ts need in terna t iona l support. In the past, the percep t ion o f o i l wea l th 
and o f entrenched corrup t ion has tended to d r ive donors away. Today, N ige r ia receives on ly US$2 
per capita in ODA compared to the average fo r A f r ica o f US$28 per capita. I t i s regarded as serious- 
underaided, an ‘a id ~ r p h a n ’ ~ . As a result, ne t transfers w i t h the rest o f the w o r l d are negative and 
average minus US$1.3 b i l l i o n annually. O n the other hand, o i l exports p rov ide N ige r ia w i t h an 
impor tan t source o f fo re ign exchange. G iven that o i l pr ices are curren t ly h igher than ever and 
expected to stay high f o r some time, N iger ia ’s o i l revenues are pro jec ted t o g row f r o m an annual 
average o f about US$15 b i l l i o n between 2000-2003 to about US$36 b i l l i o n annua l ly between 2005 
and 2008. 

13. 
N i g e r i a needs in terna t iona l f inanc ia l support in spite o f rising o i l revenues f o r three reasons. 
First, g iven the large population, pervasive pover ty and the depth o f soc ia l and economic decay 
resu l t ing f r o m years o f mismanagement, N iger ia ’s needs f o r development f inanc ing s t i l l far ou ts tr ip 
i t s pro jec ted domestic financing potential. Add i t iona l fo re ign f inanc ing i s essential i f the economy’s 
enormous in fras truc ture needs are to be met and progress made in power, transport, education, hea l th 
and safe water. The macroeconomic analysis presented in the f o l l ow i n g section show that in order to 
make adequate progress towards achieving the MDGs, N ige r ia w i l l requ ire add i t iona l external 
f inanc ing averaging about US$6.4 b i l l i o n annually between 2005 and 2008. Second, N iger ia ’s 
economy i s heav i ly dependant on oil, and i t wou ld be dangerous fo r N iger ia ’s po l icymakers t o assume 
that o i l pr ices w i l l rema in at their current levels inde f in i te ly . They s imp ly cannot spend a l l o f the 
w ind fa l l o i l revenue. They need to build reserves t o avo id a huge con trac t ion when o i l prices decline. 
N iger ia ’s large and increasing fore ign reserves indicate good po l icy . The size o f donor programs in 
infrastructure, health, education and ru ra l development shou ld be based on a med ium - te rm v is ion o f 
the country’s needs and n o t b y short-term variations in o i l prices and the country’s reserves. 
Na tura l ly , this excludes the few donor programs that spec i f ica l ly a im at suppor t ing stabilization, and 
therefore shou ld vary to o f fse t swings in in terna t iona l prices. Third, the size o f donor f inanc ing 
provides a s igna l o f support f o r reforms. N iger ia ’s economic performance has imp roved s ign i f ican t ly 
over the last t w o years and mer i ts strong support f r om the in terna t iona l commun i ty . 

14. 
Increasing support and external f inanc ing f lows t o N ige r ia requ ire ac t ion o n at least three 
interrelated fronts: (i) increasing new f inanc ing f r o m N iger ia ’s external partners, inc lud ing IDA and 
DFID; (ii) ra is ing IDA coun try performance ra t ing b y sustaining the imp lemen ta t ion o f governance 
reforms; and (iii) reduc ing N iger ia ’s external debt burden. 

15. 
As key external partners, IDA and DFID w i l l expand the ir f inanc ia l support t o N ige r ia under 
the CPS. The ind ica t ive two-year IDA lend ing p rog ram (FY06 and FY07) includes f ron t load ing o f

based o n fur ther annual assessment o f p o l i c y performance and the m id - te rm rev iew o f the CPS.

N ige r ia has been reclassified f r om a “blend” to an “ IDA -on ly ” coun try . N ige r ia meets a l l 
three cr i ter ia f o r I D A - o n l y status: l o w GNI per capita, lack o f creditworthiness and a track reco rd o f 
good po l icy performance. I t i s curren t ly the poorest coun try in the wo r ld that i s n o t c lass i f ied as IDA- 
on ly . 
I t s pe r cap i ta income i s on ly US$350, considerably be low the I D A - o n l y cu t -o f f leve l o f 
US$895. N i g e r i a i s no t cred i twor thy since i t does no t have the ab i l i ty to service new ex terna l debt at 
marke t interest rates over the l o n g term. As a result, i t cannot access pr iva te cap i ta l markets o r IBRD 
and has no t bo r rowed f rom IBRD fo r over a decade. 

17. 
N ige r ia has the po ten t ia l to re-enter the group o f m idd le- income countries (MICs) and rega in 
access to in terna t iona l f inanc ia l markets. In the l o n g run, i t w i l l achieve this through sustained and 
strengthened p o l i c y performance and increased external support. However, f o r the medium-term, 
I D A - o n l y status provides the appropriate framework to support N iger ia ’s progress towards ach iev ing 
the MDGs. The N ige r ian Government has requested this change in status f o r three reasons. First, i t 
wou ld p rov ide a signal to donors and alert them o f the need f o r increased f inanc ia l support. Second, i t 
sends a message w i th in N ige r ia that i t i s a very poo r coun try - despite be ing o i l wealthy. This w i l l 
he lp them in commun ica t ing the need o f r e f o rm and that N ige r ia shou ld avo id non-concessionary 
lend ing o r repea t ing the boom-bust mistakes o f the past. Third, i t has the advantage o f better terms o f 
IDA credit. 

18. 
N iger ia ’s to ta l pub l ic debt, estimated at about 72% o f GDP at the end o f 2004, w i l l impede i t s 
progress in a t ta in ing the MDGs. Domestic debt (about 22% o f the total) i s be ing addressed as part o f 
the Government’s reforms. A so lu t ion i s needed f o r that owed t o external creditors, ma in ly the Paris 
Club4. 

19. 
T rad i t iona l Deb t Sustainability Ana lys is (DSA ) suggests that, at current o i l prices, neither 
external no r f isca l sustainability i s an issue f o r N iger ia . However , this analysis i s ex treme ly sensitive 
to assumptions about future o i l prices. I f o i l prices f a l l b y some US$4 pe r ba r re l be low current 
projections, N iger ia ’s debt becomes unsustainable. Moreover , N ige r ia cannot ma in ta in external and 
f isca l sustainability and make appreciable progress o n the MDGs. Results o f a D S A incorpora t ing the 
add i t iona l government spending needed to reach key MDG goals show that even w i t h outstanding 
fu ture economic performance and sustained high o i l prices, i t w i l l be v i r tua l ly imposs ib le f o r N ige r ia 
to meet the MDGs and simultaneously lowe r i t s indebtedness t o sustainable leve ls (de f ined as 
60% o f GDP). On the f isca l front, although high o i l prices prevent the emergence o f a f isca l gap 
before 2012, a significant gap w i t h net present value o f US$50 b i l l i o n 5 develops over the IO-year 
MDG horizon, 2005-2015. Moreover , much larger f isca l gaps w i t h ne t present va lue o f US$90 
b i l l ion , appear as early as 2008, when o i l prices are lowe red by one standard dev ia t ion o f h is to r ica l o i l 
prices. This shows that a negative price-shock cou ld qu ick ly tr igger a debt and macroeconomic cr is is 
and deal a severe b l ow to re forms (see Annex 4). 

20. 
Reduc ing debt may also he lp t o reduce cap i ta l flight. There i s evidence t o suggest that 
N iger ians are ho ld ing s ign i f ican t amounts o f money abroad. A t t rac t ing some o f this cap i ta l back to 
N ige r ia cou ld have pos i t ive effects on investment, g r ow t h and emp loymen t creation. Emp i r ica l

evidence also indicates that, as the debt to GDP ra t io rises above 60%, cap i ta l flight i s induced. This 
imp l ies that an agreement to reduce N iger ia ’s debt wou ld he lp t o “crowd-in” repa tr ia ted capital, and 
so have a larger e f fec t on grow th . 

21. 

A large debt burden gives the w rong signals to po l icy makers. N ige r ia needs pe r iod ica l ly to 
save o i l w ind fa l ls - as i t i s do ing right now - but the issue o f debt repayment can threaten t h i s 
practice. When o i l prices are high, the debate about saving the w ind fa l l to cush ion an eventual pr ice 
decline becomes confused b y the issue o f debt repayment. There i s a strong incen t ive t o po l icymakers 
t o spend rather than save w ind fa l ls , thus perpetuating the boom-bust cycles that have characterized 
economic management in N ige r ia fo r many years. Cleaning the slate wou ld remove this source o f 
macro-po l icy weakness. 

22. 

President Obasanjo has made debt reduc t ion a key ob jec t ive o f his adm in is tra t ion . A pos i t ive 
decision on debt re l ie f wou ld p rov ide a strong signal o f support fo r the reforms. I t w o u l d enhance the 
reformers’ c red ib i l i ty and imp rove prospects fo r sustaining o f the re forms beyond the general 
elections o f 2007. The N ige r ian Government has made clear that i t w i l l use any resources released 
through debt r e l i e f to finance MDG - re la ted expenditures. 

23. 

T w o impor tan t issues are de lay ing a reso lu t ion o f N iger ia ’s debt prob lem . First, N ige r ia does 
no t have a fo rma l program w i t h the IMF, wh ich i s usually requ ired b y the Paris Club. Since early 
2004, the Fund has mon i tored on a quarterly basis the N ige r ian economic r e f o rm program. The 
enhanced surveillance program has helped the Government t o achieve commendable results in terms 
o f monetary and f isca l s tab i l i ty . The N ige r ian authorities have ind ica ted the i r w i l l ingness t o move to a 
non- f inanc ia l arrangement approved b y the Fund when such an arrangement becomes available. 
Second, there i s concern that debt re l ie f to N ige r ia w i l l create a p rob lem o f “mo ra l hazard”. N ige r ia 
should aspire t o becom ing cred i twor thy because fore ign savings w i l l be requ i red t o lift N ige r ia to 
m idd le- income status over the medium-term. Creditors wo r ry that p r o v i d i n g debt r e l i e f to N ige r ia 
today cou ld in f luence fu ture behavior, and promote a cu l ture o f lack o f respect f o r hono r ing contracts. 
In recogn i t ion o f this, N ige r ia i s f u l l y servicing i t s debt to the London Club as w e l l as i t s mu l t i la te ra l 
debt. 

24. 
N ige r ia and i t s b i la te ra l creditors and donors are discussing issues pe r ta in ing t o debt re l ie f and 
increased assistance. There are good prospects fo r increased support f o r N iger ia , especially since the 
UK has made A f r i c a a p r io r i ty area fo r attention b y the G8 and EU during i t s pe r iod o f leadership o f 
bo th in 2005. The UK i s l o o k i n g to wo rk w i t h other governments in focus ing a t ten t ion on A f r ica ,

Po l it ica l Economy and Social Context 

The “o i l curse” led to many years of political and economic destabilization, including

decades of military rule. This became the most s ign i f ican t factor underp inn ing N ige r ia ’s po l i t ica l ,

fundamental and inter-related constraints that N ige r ia must overcome i f i t i s to meet the MDGs:

Mismanagement o f the country’s o i l resources also resulted in s ign i f ican t env ironmen ta l

The incentives f o r states - pa r t icu la r ly the po l i t ica l leaders - t o engage w i t h a r e f o rm agenda have

fighting corruption, imp rov ing the ir pub l ic expenditure management and strengthening the ir capacity 
to deliver services. Though con f l ic ts can mar the federal-state relationship, the Federa l Government 
and some states are p lac ing more attention o n building consensus and coo rd ina t ion between the

severe household 
impacts 
particularly affecting women and children. 
T h e study found that 87% o f household heads were 
farmers who were often dependent on remittances from 
ill or deceased family members. Social capital was by 
far the most important asset for households coping with 
t h e impact o f AIDS. However, 50% o f households had 
gone in to debt, mostly to in forma l credit associations, 
following a death in the family. There is a dearth o f 
formal care and support options w i th a need to 
strengthen local support networks.

This i s pa r t icu la r ly true o f agriculture, and sub-sectors such as cocoa, co t ton and o i l . M o s t non -o i l 
sectors have n o t succeeded in mov ing to higher value added activities. Furthermore, g r ow t h has 
h is to r ica l ly been too volatile. With l ow g row th and inadequate d ivers i f ica t ion , i t i s n o t surprising that 
unemp loymen t rema ins high, estimated conservatively at about 10.8%’ but be l ieved t o be more 
accurately in the range o f 40-50% in key urban centers and amongst new graduates. 

Competitiveness of Nigeria’s economy has declined steadily and, wh i le N ige r ia i s the second 

4 1. 
largest economy in Sub Saharan A fr ica , i t i s one o f the least competitive, rank ing 93 ou t o f 104 
countries on the g loba l competitiveness indexg. This reflects fou r ma in constraints. 

42. 
First i s the real exchange rate appreciation over time”, o r the “Du tch disease” phenomenon, 
wh ich has weakened the non -o i l sectors. The mismanagement o f o i l revenues, and spec i f ica l ly the 
adverse effects of large fore ign exchange in f lows during o i l p r ice booms, has produced a h is to r ica l ly 
h igh ly unstable and unpredictable macroeconomic environment. 

43. 
Second, N ige r ia has a huge infrastructure deficit. Poor in fras truc ture has h indered non -o i l 
g row th in many cases and s ign i f ican t ly increased the costs o f do ing business in N ige r ia . In the power 
sector, where t h i s de f ic i t i s perhaps the most binding on economic ac t iv i ty , per capita consump t ion i s 
about 8 l k W h compared to 288kWh in Ghana and 355kWh in Ind ia . Businesses common ly repor t 
ou tpu t losses due t o power deficiencies o f up to 30%. Similarly, poo r road in fras truc ture i s estimated 
to exact an annua l cost o f about 3% o f GDP. Imp rov ing in fras truc ture i s c r i t ica l f o r rap id g row th o f 
N iger ia ’s economy, and therefore fo r achieving the income pove r ty MDG. I t i s also essential fo r 
hea l th and education services t o be prov ided and accessed b y poo r N iger ians and therefore fo r 
achieving hea l th and education MDGs. Reduc t ion o f c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , f o r example, depends d i rec t ly o n 
improvements in water supply and sanitation. 
Improvements in energy services also con tr ibu te 
d irec t ly to reduc ing smoke-induced respiratory in fec t ions and t o the time, e f fo r t and interest that 
ch i ldren can g i v e to education. Over one- th ird o f ru ra l educational and hea l th establishments in 
N ige r ia do n o t have e lec tr ica l connections. 

44. 

Third i s policy instability which, coup led w i t h a burdensome and inadequately coordinated 
regulatory and lega l framework, has created a hos t i le business environment. The Government has 
attempted unsuccessfully to compensate business operators f o r the lack o f competitiveness through 
the use o f high tariff and non - ta r i f f barriers t o protect domestic industry. Weak governance fur ther 
compounds 
the effect o f these constraints o n the economy’s competitiveness and secures 
opportunities f o r rent-seeking behavior. Concerted ac t ion i s requ ired o n several fron ts and through a l l 
tiers o f government.

A fou r th constraint i s inadequate access to medium- and long-term finance. M o n e y and 
securities markets are underdeveloped, and the po l icy env ironmen t does no t p rov ide adequate 
incentives fo r a strong in termed iary function. M o r e than 9 5% o f c red i t p rov ided t o the p r iva te sector

The Government’s reform program i s beg inn ing to tackle these unde r ly ing constraints t o

In 
particular, the Governmen t i s : 

Con t inu ing f isca l prudence and building a cushion o f reserves during per iods o f high o i l 
pr ices . This i s essential fo r ma in ta in ing a compe t i t ive and stable rea l exchange rate; 
Acce lera t ing i t s program o f investment in infrastructure, especially power , na tura l gas 
and transport. This w i l l reduce the cost o f do ing business and ensure that r u r a l producers 
are linked to markets. In parallel, Government i s putting in place po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions 
t o ensure adequate maintenance o f infrastructure; 
Strengthening govemance and f igh t ing corrup t ion , extending t h i s t o areas that d i rec t ly 
a f fec t the country’s competitiveness - e.g. po r t concessioning and customs reforms; 
Im p r o v i n g the business environment b y reduc ing po l icy-re la ted costs and r i s k s such as 
corrup t ion , red-tape and administrative barriers, a weak lega l system, inadequate 
p ro tec t ion o f property rights, inadequate enforcement o f t a r i f f s and p o l i c y and other 
uncertainties associated w i t h exchange rate and other prices; and, 
Re fo rm ing the f inanc ia l sector such that i t i s more stable and e f f ic ien t . Simultaneously, 
the Government i s p i lo t ing specific programs on: access t o cred i t f o r small-scale, 
env ironmen ta l ly sustainable infrastructure investments b y Fadama farmers; commun i ty 
f inanc ing fo r small-scale mining ac t iv i t ies in the so l id m inera ls sector; and comme rc ia l ly 
sustainable f inanc ia l services to micro-, small- and medium-enterprises. 

Shared growth in N iger ia - a role for agriculture. Un lock ing the po ten t ia l o f sectors (such 

47. 
as agriculture) on wh ich the poor depend i s cruc ia l to ach iev ing ‘shared g row th ’ in N iger ia . 
Ag r icu l tu re i s the mainstay o f the ru ra l economy and, since mos t o f N iger ia ’s poo r l i v e and w o r k in 
ru ra l areas, the hea l th o f the sector i s fundamental to pover ty reduction. As a large economic sector 
(some 30% o f GDP), agriculture affects g row th o f ou tpu t and the expenditure side o f the economy 
through consump t ion (65%-70% o f GDP), p rov id ing par t o f the incomes o f an estimated 75% o f the 
popu la t ion - pa r t icu la r ly among the poor. T rad ing and processing produce also supports a s ign i f ican t 
p ropo r t ion o f the urban poor. 

48. 
In the past, N ige r ian agr icu l ture has per formed poo r ly as a resu l t o f “resource curse’’ effects 
o f o i l and inappropriate po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions . Since democracy returned, agr icu l ture has 
per formed better. 
In the f i v e years to 2003, the sector grew by 4.6% p.a. With l im i t e d technical 
change, in an attempt to produce more and ma in ta in l i v i n g standards (as c rop pr ices have n o t kep t 
pace w i t h inflation) farmers have increased the cropped area. 
In the short- t o medium-term, the 
current g row th in agriculture w i l l continue. But in the longer-term, dec l in ing l a n d fe r t i l i ty due to 
shorter fa l low periods, l ow use o f p roduc t iv i ty enhancing technology, labo r shortages w i t h rising 
labor costs and ageing farmers w i l l present form idab le barriers t o g row th o f output. Unsustainable 
water use has also cost agriculture dearly; there were 26,000 sq. km o f degraded lands in 1993-95 - a 
near n ine - fo ld increase in 20 years. 

49. 
F o r bringing benefits to the poor and the broader economy, a turn-around in agr icu l tura l 
p roduc t iv i ty w i l l be necessary in N iger ia . Greater p roduc t iv i ty can generate h ighe r incomes f o r the 
ru ra l poor, reduce the cost o f consump t ion f o r the urban poor, stimulate indus t r ia l iza t ion through 
reduc ing the cost o f r aw materials a n d o r increasing expor t l e d grow th” .

This strategy, and the imp l ied need fo r higher levels o f support, i s developed around a

economic in fras truc ture deficit, 
par t icu lar ly in the power and roads sectors, and p rov ide basis fo r 
increased access t o basic social services. Pub l ic investments wou ld also catalyze p r iva te investments 
inc lud ing in infrastructure. Pub l ic investment wou ld average about 11% of GDP and pr iva te 
investment about 14.5% o f GDP annually over the pe r iod f r om 9.3% and 13.0% respectively in 2004. 
At the same time, gross na t iona l savings wou ld decline to about 20.9% o f GDP annua l ly compared to 
27.1% in 2004, in order to accommodate rising per capita consumption. 

56. 
W i t h pub l ic expenditures rising to make progress o n the MDGs and mo re a id resource f lows , 
some degree o f rea l exchange rate appreciation can be expected. Con t inued prudent f isca l 
management-in particular, adherence to the o i l -p r ice based f isca l rule, tight monetary po l icy , and

can de l iver a substantial agriculture g row th dividend.

111. COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT AGENDA: NEEDS AND SEEDS 

A New Framework for Reform, Growth and Poverty Reduction 

62. 
The N E E D S and state-level SEEDS form the national framework of Nigeria’s home-grown 
poverty reduction strategy. The development o f the NEEDS en joyed strong ownership. I t underscores 
the Government’s comm i tmen t to an ambitious development agenda that aims to p lace N ige r ia on a 
pa th o f sustainable long- term g row th and poverty reduction, through changing attitudes and behaviors 
as w e l l as po l ic ies and legislation. In M a y 2004, President Obasanjo o f f ic ia l ly launched the NEEDS , 
although imp lemen ta t ion o f key elements began in mid 2003. M o s t o f the 36 state governments have 
prepared and are beg inn ing to implement their SEEDS - though progress varies. The in terna t iona l 
commun i ty recognizes that NEEDS and SEEDS present a s ign i f ican t shift in the coun try ’s agenda and 
a coherent f ramewo rk for fu ture increased engagement. I t also prov ides a r a l l y i n g p o i n t f o r donor 
coord ina t ion and harmonization. 

63. 
The N E E D S honestly and se l f-cr i t ica l ly assesses pover ty and the lack o f g row th in N iger ia , 
the ir causes, and the challenges con fron t ing the nation. W h i l e highlighting N iger ia ’s potential, 
NEEDS po in ts out that N ige r ia i s currently one o f the weakest economies in A f r i c a (a l though the 
second largest in sub-Saharan A fr ica) , and one o f the poorest countries in the wo r ld . Acco rd ing t o the 
NEEDS , ach iev ing the MDGs i s a c r i t ica l challenge fo r N ige r ia . Therefore, N E E D S places g row th o f 
the economy f i r m l y at the centre o f i t s agenda. There i s a clear recogn i t ion tha t sustained pover ty 
reduc t ion w i l l not be achieved w i thou t improved economic performance, pa r t icu la r ly in the non -o i l 
economy in w h i c h mos t o f the poo r participate. 

64. 
N E E D S Vision. The NEEDS sets out a v is ion f o r wea l th creation, emp loymen t generation, 
pover ty reduc t ion and value reorientation. NEEDS i s founded o n three pillars: (i) empower ing peop le 
and building a social contract; (ii) p romo t ing pr iva te enterprise; and, (iii) chang ing the way 
government works. 

65. 
Empowenngpeople and building a social contract. N E ED S seeks imp roved access t o health, 
basic education, safe water, welfare, employment and security 
through empowerment and 
par t ic ipa t ion . I t proposes a social charter wh ich recognizes the right o f N ige r ians to government 
services and accountability. In education, the po l icy t h r u s t includes the p rov is ion o f unh indered access 
to Un iversa l Bas ic Educa t ion (UBE) to a l l ch i ldren o f school-going age. I t seeks the establishment 
and maintenance o f qua l i ty standards through appropriate cu r r icu la and qua l i ty con tro l . N E ED S calls 
f o r capacity building in post basic education and t ra in ing f o r the know ledge economy. In health, key 
elements inc lude reduc ing the disease burden o f malaria, TB, W / A I D S and reproduc t ive hea l th 
related illnesses. NEEDS ca l ls f o r improved ava i lab i l i ty and management o f hea l th resources 
(financial, human etc). The Federal Government’s hea l th r e f o rm p rog ram w i l l support the 
development o f imp roved p r ima ry hea l th care services at state leve l w i t h a special emphasis on 
rou t ine immun iza t ion . N E ED S anticipates the preparation o f de ta i led sector strategies that w i l l 
c lear ly delineate the roles and responsibilities o f the three tiers o f Governmen t in service prov is ion . 
This should e l im ina te waste and dup l ica t ion o f e f for t . Sector programs for these strategies are t o be 
p r io r i t ized and costed and pub l ic spending fo r services increas ing ly based on performance 
benchmarks. This pillar recognizes that success in de l ive r ing the soc ia l charter w i l l depend o n close 
co l labora t ion between a l l stakeholders: federal, state and loca l governments as w e l l as the pr iva te 
sector, NGOs and the in terna t iona l commun i ty . The N E ED S also envisages the crea t ion o f a strong 
safety ne t program f o r pa r t icu la r ly vulnerable groups.

Promoting private enterprise to foster growth of the non-oil sector. The N E E D S p r io r i t izes 
imp rov ing per formance in agriculture and S M E s in order to build a stronger connec t ion between 
grow th , emp loymen t and poverty reduction. Pr iva te sector led g row th and a sound macroeconomic 
f ramewo rk are considered key elements o f N iger ia ’s economic transformation. 
Speeding up 
pr iva t iza t ion , de-regulation and l ibera l iza t ion are impor tan t pr ior i t ies . The N E E D S emphasizes the 
impor tance o f a conducive business environment fo r fo rma l and in fo rma l enterprises and ou t l ines a 
p rog ram o f ins t i tu t iona l and administrative re forms to reduce the cost o f do ing business in N ige r ia . 
These inc lude : r e f o rm o f business regu la t ion and reg is tra t ion processes, taxes, k e y trade fac i l i ta t ion 
services inc lud ing customs, ports administration, and related f inanc ia l and service prov is ions . The 
structure o f the tax system i s be ing s imp l i f ied and appropriate incentives are be ing in troduced to 
encourage business ac t iv i ty . Tax adm in is tra t ion i s be ing overhauled and modernized. In para l le l , 
N ige r ian ports are be ing concessioned to increase the ir e f f ic iency and reduce h idden costs t o pr iva te 
operators. Customs reforms are addressing corruption, addressing s ta f f 
t ra in ing needs and 
modern iz ing operations. 

67 . 

The N E E D S stresses the importance o f economic infrastructure - transport, power , and 
telecommunications - wh ich are the ma jo r bottlenecks f o r p r iva te sector l e d grow th . Pr iva te 
p rov is ion o f in fras truc ture and pub l ic pr iva te partnerships w i l l be encouraged. L a w s t o imp rove 
compe t i t ion and protect consumer welfare in industries p rov id ing infrastructure services are t o be 
enforced. Im p r o v i n g ru ra l infrastructure and programs o f ru ra l access and m o b i l i t y are assigned high 
p r io r i ty . The N E E D S stresses the importance o f a strong f inanc ia l system, w i t h b igge r asset volume, 
ins trumen t d ive rs i ty and an incen t ive structure in support o f g row th in the rea l sector. The 
government has ra ised the minimum cap i ta l requirements f o r banks f r o m N 2 billion t o N 2 5 b i l l i o n in 
a ma jo r in i t ia t ive t o reduce r i s k s posed to the system b y unsound banks. The N E E D S comm i ts the 
government t o d ive rs i fy ing the economy away f r om o i l , gradua l ly l ibe ra l iz ing impo r ts and 
strengthening N iger ia ’s par t ic ipa t ion in reg iona l integration. 

68. 

Changing the way that government works. As par t o f value reorientation, the N E ED S 
emphasizes the break f r om “business as usual”. I t spells out an amb i t ious agenda f o r fighting 
co r rup t ion and addressing the issues related to a large and under-per form ing pub l ic sector. The 
N E ED S states c lear ly that government must change t o a l low space f o r the p r iva te sector t o func t ion 
e f fec t ive ly and inves t in people and in the de l ive ry o f services. Government ins t i tu t ions are t o be 
restructured, 
r igh t-s ized and re-professionalized 
to 
imp rove 
the ir performance. 
Enhanc ing 
transparency and accountability in resource use and dec is ion mak ing are considered c ruc ia l in mak ing 
government perform. Under the Procurement B i l l subm i t ted t o the Na t iona l Assemb ly in January 
2005, a Pub l ic Procurement Bureau i s to be established t o oversee imp lemen ta t ion o f new 
procurement regulations that in troduce open and compe t i t ive processes f o r pub l ic procurement. 
Re forms o f jus t ice adm in is tra t ion and the po l ice w i l l strengthen the wo rk o f targeted an t i-corrup t ion 
agencies such as the In terna t iona l Centre fo r the Preven t ion o f Crime (ICPC) and the Econom ic and 
F inanc ia l Crimes Comm iss ion (EFCC). Econom ic Coo rd ina t ion w i l l be imp roved b o t h across the 
Federal Government and between the d i f feren t tiers o f government. State governments are f o l l ow i n g 
suit and are addressing the issues o f more e f fec t ive government in the i r o w n SEEDS. Such 
improvements in coord ina t ion and func t ion ing w i l l c a l l f o r stronger mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion 
systems served b y h igh-qua l i ty data that are generated, analyzed and disseminated through the tiers o f 
government. Building greater f isca l respons ib i l i ty , i n i t i a l l y through a pact w i t h a l l states, and through 
a B i l l t o be passed in the Na t iona l Assembly in 2005, w i l l p rov ide a strong basis fo r strengthening 
systems and coord ina t ion across tiers o f government.

The Government has set up a Pres iden t ia l Imp lemen ta t ion Comm i t tee t o take fo rwa rd the

Tangible Progress on Implementing the NEEDS and Improving Governance 

70. 
NEEDS accurately diagnoses the key development constraints fac ing N i g e r i a and proposes a 
sound agenda to address them. 
Imp lemen ta t ion nevertheless presents several challenges: weak 
capacity, N iger ia ’s h is tory o f poo r po l icy and strategy imp lemen ta t ion and the resistance to re fo rm 
f r o m vested interests. While re fo rm imp lemen ta t ion to date has been impressive, there have also been 
set-backs. Tak ing a long- term perspective, con t inu ing the process o f “value reor ien ta t ion” and 
embedding key reforms that can carry beyond the 2007 elections are essential i f the constraints to 
re fo rm are to be overcome.

social charter f o r human development and empowerment as ou t l ined in N iger ia ’s homeg rown pove r ty 
reduc t ion strategy - the NEEDS . 

76 . 
I t i s essential that every aspect o f the CPS and each in terven t ion in terna l ize an understanding 
o f the po l i t ica l economy and works to unb lock the three unde r ly ing constraints h igh l igh ted ear l ier - 
mismanagement o f o i l revenues, weak fo rma l accoun tab i l i ty and transparency, and poo r non -o i l 
grow th . The CPS w i l l be implemented during the po l i t ica l uncertainty o f general elections in 2007 in 
wh ich President Obasanjo w i l l no t run. Hence, a key ob jec t ive o f the CPS i s to support r e f o rm e f fo r ts 
and ensure that they are sustainable over the med ium term. The key objectives o f the re fo rms - 
empowerment, g row th and good governance - have broad support among the N ige r ian popu la t ion . 
However , p ow e r f u l interest groups are los ing econom ica l ly and po l i t ica l ly and are resistant t o change. 
This resistance i s l i k e l y to increase du r ing the e lec t ion process. In v iew o f this, the Government, the 
W o r l d Bank G roup and DFID agreed on the fo l low ing : 

The W o r l d Bank Group and DFID shou ld use the occasion o f this CPS t o send a s trong 
signal o f support fo r N iger ia ’s reforms; 
The CPS should iden t i fy some early tang ib le results (“quick wins”), espec ia l ly in the area 
o f infrastructure, in order to he lp demonstrate benefits f r o m reforms; 
The strong partnership between Government, the W o r l d B a n k and DFID shou ld be 
extended t o inc lude other members o f the in terna t iona l community’2, c i v i l society and 
p r iva te sector groups. This w i l l create space fo r voices supportive o f m o v i n g N i g e r i a 
fo rwa rd in a way that benefits a l l Nigerians; 
DFID - w i t h other members o f the in terna t iona l commun i ty - w i l l support the e lec t ion 
process; 
The CPS should iden t i fy pe r fo rm ing states - lead states - and wo rk c lose ly w i t h them, thus 
he lp ing spread the support fo r re forms beyond the Federal Government; 
Partnership w i t h the legislature should be strengthened (e.g. through WB I and DFID 
programs); and, 
A communications strategy should be an in tegra l par t o f the CPS. 

77. 

The po l i t ica l r i s k s are high (see risk section), but the po ten t ia l gains f o r N i g e r i a and the who le 
reg ion are also great. Therefore, the W o r l d Bank G roup and DFID have agreed tha t the t ime i s right 
to increase support for N iger ia . A mid-term review o f the CPS w i l l be carr ied ou t a f ter t w o years o f

p rov ide an oppor tun i ty to assess results and adjust the strategy in response t o lessons learn t as w e l l as 
in response to economic and po l i t ica l developments. 

’’ Other development partners - the UN and the ADB among others -have given strong support in response to the CPS for 
moving towards a jo in t donor strategic framework i n support o f NEEDS and SEEDS and intensifying further on jo in t

Box 7: Partnership for Impact - WB / DFID 

Effective support for Nigeria's development agenda w i l l benefit from working towards collaborative advantage among development 
partners, based 011 comparative strengths. We recognize the following, though not necessarily exclusive, strengths: 
World Bank Group - global analytical capacity, informed by worldwide experience and lessons leamed, substantial financia 
and staffresources; ccuvening power of a multilateral institution; and, direct engagement with organized p r i m sector (E). 
DFID - specialist country analytical capacity, including work on political economy issues; work on the demand-side of rights and 
governance with direct engagemeat with non-govemment stakeholders (parliamentarians , c i v i l society, private sector); flexible 
use of grant resources; rapid global access to expertise; readiness to test new ideas or ways of working; intanational access 8s a 
CWEU government agency; sustained field-level presence; and, experience of inter-sectoral analysis and working. 
These strengths are h i a y complementary and w i l l be effectively inter-woven to deliver greater impact. I t i s anticipated that enhanced 
development effectiveness w i l l require continued joint analysis, maintaining a common understanding and prioritization in policy 
dialogue with governments. We anticipate that the CPS w i l l benefit from a combmtion of separate and joint products or forms of 
support. 
In addition to enhanced impact at federal and state level, i t i s expected that t h i s w i l l reduce the transaction costs to 
government of engaging with its development parmers. 
Th e agencies will work together to build a stronger field presence for sustained policy dialogue and development effectiveness. 
based on DFlD's existing redona1 presence. We w i l l have a joint framework for engagement in up to six lead states over the CPS 
period. 
'Ihe two agencies w i l l implement the joint strategy in support of the three common outcomes. T h i s w i l l involve agencies assuming 
leadership on particularly secton, recognizing and supporting the comparative strength of other development partners in the process, 
though t h i s may involve joint working. An indicative list includes: 
World Bank Group- Public service reform, procurement reform, infrastructure, investment climate. education, urban water, 
DFLD - Health, HIVIAids, rural watcr, security, making markets work better for the poor, coalition building on key growth and 
economic analysis and policy dialogue. 
governance issues across government and non-government stakeholders, rapid response to TA requests from Federal 
GoVCIUmUlt 
Outcome coordinators. Both agencies w i l l seek to broaden the. parmership with other development partners - under a govenuaeot-led 
We w i l l continue to pmue greater convergence on seategy and joint working arrangements over the CPS period, a key role for joint 
strategy - building on the interested already shown by the UN, the ADB and others in response to consultation on the CPS. 
Furthermorr, interventions acrcss members of the World Bank Group - IDA, IFC. WBI, M IGA -have a CDmplemeatary role to play in 
delivering the strategy. 

Lessons f rom Joint I n t e r im Strategy and DFID CSP 

78. 

The CPS builds upon an assessment o f imp lemen ta t ion experience o f the World B a n k Group 
and DFID since 1999. A detailed account o f this assessment i s contained in the I n t e r im Strategy 
Comp le t ion Repor t (see Annex 2). The ma in lessons are summarized be low : 

I n 1999 there was an overestimation of the scope for progress and a concomitant 
underestimation of the political economy challenges in N ige r ia . The p o l i t i c a l economy o f 
N ige r ia was no t a central part o f the strategic analysis at the beg inn ing o f the pe r iod o f 
c iv i l ian ru le . I n particular, the ways in wh ich established interests and re la t ions o f powe r - 
revo lv ing ma in ly around the o i l economy but extending i n t o the p o l i t i c a l sphere -have 
h is tor ica l ly impeded change and ma in ta ined and entrenched inequa l i ty were la rge ly 
overlooked. The degree o f ins t i tu t iona l deterioration, the entrenchment o f co r rup t practices, 
the lack o f accoun tab i l i ty and transparency were greater than i n i t i a l l y imag ined . The W o r l d 
Bank's absence affected i t s know ledge base and the po r t fo l io contracted be fo re 1999 
p rov id ing very l im i t e d experience on h ow t o engage o n re form . 
Strong ownership, a clear govemment agenda and commitment are prerequisites to effective 
interventions and support. Suppor t ing the Federal Government in areas where there i s high 
leve l o f comm i tmen t brings results (e.g. the areas o f transparency, c i v i l serv ice re form) . 
Experience at state leve l also strongly suggests that state government comm i tmen t and 
capacity i s c r i t ica l f o r successful projects and e f fec t ive support. 
The quality of policy dialogue and project preparation and implementation strongly depends 
on the quality and scope of analytical work (AAA). Con t inued ana ly t ica l work i s needed t o 
upgrade the qua l i ty o f the dialogue w i t h the federal and state governments, espec ia l ly 
regarding the use o f the o i l resources ( f isca l management and l inkages w i t h domestic

industry) and non -o i l growth. AAA w i l l be par t icu lar ly impo r tan t in wo rk ing d irec t ly w i t h 
states and in imp rov ing the relationship between the Federal Governmen t and the states. 
The la rge number of states (36), unclear division of responsibilities and poor relationships 
across govemment tiers have afSected the quality and efectiveness of assistance. A t temp ts to 
guarantee na t iona l coverage d i lu ted the resources available f o r each state. This reduced 
impac t and leverage to seek significant ins t i tu t iona l improvements. F i x e d comm i tmen ts per 
state, pe r project, introduced r ig id i t ies and jeopardized imp lemen ta t ion progress and lowe red 
disbursement ratios. Assistance fo r the de l ivery o f basic services was pa r t icu la r ly affected. 
The Govemment and the Wor ld Bank lacked the tools to manage the risks of the program . 
Past experience shows that projects tend to stall, leav ing substantial resources stranded. 
F l e x i b i l i t y should a l low the country team and Government t o reallocate resources to 
pe r fo rm ing non-per form ing projects/states. 
Few tangible results in the short-term limited the scope for reform. Focus o n tangible results 
has to d r ive the re fo rm program, inc lud ing results that can build momen tum f o r a change in 
po l i t ica l behaviors. This requires no t to be hindered b y the lack o f “modern” leg is la t ion . 
Progress in procurement and energy has been possible even when m o d em lega l frameworks 
are lack ing . Also, donor coord ina t ion i s requ ired early o n in diagnosis and design. 

79. 

In addition, the preparation 
o f the CPS built on the lessons 
learned f r om W o r l d Bank assistance 
to other large federal countries, such 
as B raz i l , Ind ia (also d raw ing on 
DFID’s 
experiences), Mex ico , 
Russia. M a i n lessons include: (i) t o 
operate e f fec t ive ly

clear 
d i f feren t ia t ion o f interventions and 
expected outcome at Federal and

and

A Results Based Strategy 

Box 8: Development of the CPS - A participatory approacb 

The CPS supports the Government’s development agenda, as artidat& in the 
NEEDS and SEEDS, which enjoy the strong support of the intanatioaal community. 
The CPS builds on lessons h e d in the Joint Intgim Strategy and DFID’s Country 
Assistance Plan, which i s based on an inte.nsive analysis of the political economy of 
Nigeria that involved a wide-range of Nigerian and i n t e r n a t i d mperis. 
The development of the CPS was a close collaboration among federal and state 
governments with development parmers, particularly the World Bank and DmD. 
The CPS was gradually defined over a series of intensive retreats and meetings. It 
was further articulated by a CPS Core Team that included members from 
Government, the World Bank Group and DFID. Thc team also benefited from 
lesson learning from global experience of other World Bank CASs . 
Strategic propositions were tested with a range “ o f stakeholdas from 
govcmment, parliament, c i v i l society, academia and private sector, at aational, 
fedem1 and state levels. ’Ihc consultations helped to validate the overall strategic 
focus of the CPS and helped the team to reflect on a number of key issues. Close 
consultation on tbe development of the CPS was kept with Fedaal Ministers and a 
number of state governors. 

80. 
D raw ing f r o m the above lessons, the 
proposed strategy 
i s based on 
fou r 
principles: (i) rea l ism about opportunities 
and scope fo r change; (ii) responsiveness 
and Government ownership; (iii) se lec t iv i ty 
fo r impact; and ( iv) ba lanc ing a longer- term 
transformational agenda w i t h the need fo r 
more direct, shorter-term impacts.

economic g r o w t h and meeting the MDGs. The CPS applies se lec t iv i ty in fou r d i f fe ren t ways: (i) i t 
focuses on a sub-set o f issues in the three p r io r i ty areas iden t i f ied b y the N E ED S (see F igu re 3), (ii) i t 
defines outcomes and allocates assistance according to the leve l o f commitment, need and capacity at 
na t iona l and state level, (iii) in addressing MDGs, i t focuses on a few key issues - f o r example, c h i l d 
and ma terna l mo r ta l i ty , girls’ education, €€IV/AIDS, 
safe water - in areas where human development 
ind ica tors are a t the ir worst; and ( iv) i t strengthens incentives f o r states t o demonstrate the ir 
comm i tmen t t o accountability, transparency and service de l ivery . Thus, the strategy sees i t s impac t in 
he lp ing to deve lop - and reward ing - a number o f ‘models’ o f development and g r ow t h in the lead 
states, wh i le addressing progress on the MDGs and public good issues na t ionw ide . Furthermore, a 
key element o f the strategy i s to lever improvements in the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f public 
expenditure to broaden and sustain impact.

118. Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Recent experience in N i g e r i a has shown the 
bene f i ts o f ana ly t ica l and advisory assistance in in fo rm ing pro jec t design and h e l p i n g the Government 
to make s ign i f ican t po l icy achievements. A c l ien t survey also showed that World B a n k adv isory 
services are very h igh ly valued b y Government counterparts. This also been a m a j o r and va lued focus 
o f support f r o m DFID to N ige r ian government, c i v i l society and p r iva te sector stakeholders. 
Ana ly t ica l w o r k w i l l focus on iden t i fy ing and p r io r i t iz ing the constraints to grow th , comb ined w i t h 
the analysis o f the social and pover ty impac t o f po l icy re forms and pub l ic ac t ions designed to 
overcome them. These wou ld embody a mu l t i-sec tora l approach t o i d e n t i f y po l ic ies , pub l ic 
expenditures and investments needed to, fo r instance, achieve growth, strengthening the p r iva te 
sector, and manag ing na tura l resources revenues. M o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion ins trumen ts w i l l also 
receive special a t ten t ion w i th in the program o f AAA. Econom ic analysis and p o l i c y d ia logue become 
even more impor tan t as the CPS intensifies involvement, develops strategic re la t ionsh ips w i t h lead 
states and supports the creation o f models o f g row th and development at state leve l . The CPS 
therefore includes a program o f ana ly t ica l and adv isory w o r k focused on the N E E D S p i l la rs and the 
CPS’s three outcomes. Table 6 presents the core p rog ram (see Annex 5 fo r details). 

119. 
Ana ly t ica l and advisory ac t iv i t ies w i l l underp in the w o r k on each o f the three outcome

T o support the Government e f fo r t in imp rov ing transparency and accoun tab i l i ty , the CPS 
envisages regu lar assessment o f governance and corrup t ion r i s k s , inc lud ing at state leve l . In addition, 
the Pub l ic Expend i ture Management and F inanc ia l Assessment (FY06) w i l l focus o n f isca l

in strengthening parliamentary oversight and W B I w i l l enhance i t s p rog ram w i t h the med ia and the 
academia. 

122. W o r k a t the lead state leve l w i l l require a state specific know ledge crea t ion and po l icy 
dialogue e f for t . Therefore, the CPS includes a state ana ly t ica l and adv isory service fac i l i ty wh ich 
a l lows to de f ine ana ly t ica l areas and tools based on the specific needs and strategic p r io r i t ies o f the 
state as iden t i f ied in their SEEDS. F o r example, depending on the state, this f a c i l i t y c o u l d be used to 
analyze pover ty o r ru ra l development, f inanc ia l sector weaknesses o r e f f ic iency and equ i ty o f pub l ic 
resource use. 

123. Within reg iona l integration, the W o r l d Bank i s supporting e f for ts to reverse trends in l a n d and

land and water degradation. 

124. 
In order to imp rove qua l i ty and ensure a stronger impact, near ly a l l AAA w o r k w i l l be done in 
partnership w i t h state and federal stakeholders building on ex is t ing ins t i tu t iona l capacity. F o r 
example, the C E M wh ich i s to focus o n sources o f growth, trade p o l i c y issues and imp l ica t ions o f the

relevant development partners t o arr ive at a shared understanding and approach w h i l e reduc ing the 
transaction costs for government and other partners. In addition, as part o f the N E E D S and the CPS 
results orientation, instruments - such as investmenthusiness c l ima te assessments, pove r ty surveys, 
mon i to r ing and others - w i l l be used to he lp the Government and o ther stakeholders mon i to r

125. 
IDA Portfolio Management and Performance. Ea r ly results o f the strategy are l i k e l y to be 
achieved mos t ly through the ex is t ing po r t fo l io and non- lend ing activities. These w i l l be impo r tan t in 
he lp ing to embed the gains o f key reforms made b y Government. The curren t IDA p o r t f o l i o fo r 
N ige r ia has 16 projects and a comm i tmen t value o f about US$1.48 b i l l ion . O f this amount, about 
US$258 m i l l i o n has been disbursed as o f M a y 3, 2005. The disbursement ra t io in FY04 increased to 
about 13% f r o m about 3.5% in FY03 and i s estimated to be about 15% in FY05. F iduc ia ry 
comp l iance in FY04 was 100%. A l though the po r t fo l io i s re la t ive ly young (average imp lemen ta t ion 
pe r iod i s 2.6 years), implementation has no t me t expectations. S ix projects have an unsa t is fac tory DO 
o r IP ra t ing . Po r t fo l io analysis has iden t i f ied f i v e systemic factors that hamper imp lemen ta t ion : (i) 
comp lex p ro jec t design, project management, and imp lemen ta t ion procedures; (ii) downs tream delays 
due to premature launch o f projects and consequent underestimation o f imp lemen ta t ion capacity; (iii) 
inadequateAate counterpart funding; ( iv) weak results management, o f ten due t o inadequate 
mon i to r ing and evaluation systems and capacity; and (v) po l i t ica l interference, incen t ives issues, and 
r ig id i t ies in app ly ing performance-based pr inc ip les ( inc lud ing imp l ica t ions f o r less w e l l pe r fo rm ing 
states). Several projects have areas o f overlap (e.g. in states, s i m i l a r activities, CDD) and, thus, 
p rov ide oppor tun i t ies fo r harmonization, consolidation, more e f f ic ien t imp lemen ta t ion and lowe r 
transaction costs. 

126. R igorous analysis and mon i to r ing have been carr ied out since 2003, th rough semi-annual j o i n t 
CPPRs; the latest CPPR was in December 2004. These po r t fo l io rev iews have iden t i f ied systemic and 
pro jec t-spec i f ic issues and set strategic p r io r i t ies and t ime-bound actions f o r sustained p o r t f o l i o 
performance improvement. K e y among these actions are the p o r t f o l i o restructuring, ha rmon iza t ion o f 
the C D D projects, and reso lu t ion o f systemic issues. Project-specific ac t ion p lans have been devised 
and imp lemen ted and have brough t encouraging signals o f imp roved po r t fo l io per formance . To ensure 
the po r t fo l io ’s con t inued improvement fo r fu ture operations the systemic issues are be ing addressed 
through the f o l l ow i n g immediate steps: (i) new operations w i l l s tr ive f o r s imp l i f ica t ion , 
f l e x i b i l i t y 
and imp lemen ta t ion readiness (projects now use a readiness gu ide during prepara t ion t o ensure that 
the pro jec t i s ready f o r imp lemen ta t ion and t o reduce effectiveness delays); (ii) coun try f inanc ing 
parameters (CFP) have been established to he lp harmon ize and ra t iona l ize the f inanc ing o f the to ta l 
coun try program, especially when counterpart f inanc ing issues are acute and po ten t ia l rewards are 
high, e.g. social sector and C D D projects may be f inanced up t o loo%, when appropriate, inc lud ing 
selected on-going projects fo r disbursements go ing fo rwa rd (iii) more f lex ib le and s imp l i f ied W o r l d 
Bank procedures are be ing introduced, inc lud ing disbursement s imp l i f ica t ion , increased procuremen t 
thresholds fo r p r i o r rev iews and harmonized imp lemen ta t ion arrangements; ( iv ) p ro jec t mon i to r ing 
and evaluation systems are be ing strengthened; (v) capacity building and sca l ing up good practices are 
enhanced; and (v i ) projects w i l l continue to be rewo rked in a l ignmen t w i t h the CPS, as needed. 

127. 
The po r t fo l io res truc tur ing underway i s designed to imp rove performance o f p rob lem pro jec ts 
and other p r io r i ty operations in full alignment w i t h the objectives, p r inc ip les and approaches of the 
CPS and NEEDS. A to ta l o f e igh t projects (about 54% o f to ta l commitments) are be ing res truc tured 
and another tw o operations based on the CDD approach are be ing harmon ized and w i l l be adjusted

( i ) restructuring of pr ior ity projects, including non-pelforming projects (tota l US$803m). 
Eight pro jec ts (private sector support, universal basic education, second hea l th systems, 
community-based urban development, and commun i ty based pover ty reduction, HTV /A IDS , 
Lagos u rban transport and transmission development) are be ing restructured. The 
res truc tur ing entails: s imp l i fy ing the pro jec t design, a l low ing greater f l e x i b i l i t y in iden t i fy ing 
the ac t iv i t ies to be financed at state level, strengthening commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion in dec is ion

( i i ) harmonization and gradual consolidation of CDD - type operations (tota l US$430m) . The 
rev iew of the f i v e CDD - type operations showed a dispersion o f activities, uncoord ina ted 
approaches and operational practices and a variety o f imp lemen t ing arrangements w i t h 
d i f fe ren t leve l o f effectiveness and e f f ic iency . As a f i r s t step, the opera t iona l manuals o f the 
projects are be ing harmonized to ensure a consistent approach, based o n lessons learned about 
best prac t ice in N iger ia . A thorough evaluation o f the C D D operations w i l l be ca r r ied ou t in 
F Y 0 6 and w i l l iden t i fy the pe r fo rm ing aspects and approaches wh ich w i l l f o r m the basis f o r

systems and result framework o f specific projects are be ing strengthened and a l igned t o the 
framework o f the CPS. 

Short- and medium-term prospects for IDA portfolio improvements. As a resu l t o f po r t fo l io 

128. 
rev iews and the CPS preparation consultations, there are n ow encouraging signals that the p o r t f o l i o i s 
be ing repos i t ioned in the con tex t o f the NEEDS . The po r t fo l io res truc tur ing and improvemen t 
measures are expected t o trigger: (i) incremen ta l improvements in the shor t te rm (e.g. faster 
implementation, 
increased disbursements, better M&E, especially in the per formance o f w e l l 
pos i t ioned states and federal units); and (ii) v is ib le and sustained gains in the m e d i um te rm (e.g. 
intermediate resu l tdqu ick wins, harmonization, program cohesion at Federa l and State leve l and 
fur ther streamlining of the ex is t ing projects). As the restructured pro jec ts are re la t ive ly young and 
have disbursed on ly a sma l l percentage o f ne t commitments, they stand a good chance o f using 
e f fec t ive ly the undisbursed c red i t balance. As a result, the outcomes o f the c los ing projects, as 
evaluated b y OED, also have a good chance t o gradua l ly imp rove and, thus, reverse N ige r ia ’s coun try 
record on outcomes in the near future. Decen tra l iza t ion and s ta f f organ iza t ion around the CPS, as w e l l 
as the D F I D m o r l d Bank partnership, are essential factors f o r s ign i f ican t ly imp roved po r t fo l io 
performance. The po r t fo l io performance w i l l be mon i to red sys tema t ica l ly w i t h respect t o the 
aforementioned expectations. 

DFZD Portfolio Management and Performance. 

129. 
DFID has managed i t s p o r t f o l i o and 
p ipe l ine to a l ign w i t h the N E E D W E E D S agenda and t o become mo re focused on j o i n t wo rk ing w i t h

coun try- led in i t ia t ive , based o n the SEEDS process that w i l l be amenable t o a mu l t i -dono r approach. 
The new focus has been described in the DFID Coun t ry Assistance P lan (CAP). The CAP became the 
founda t ion fo r wo rk in support o f N ige r ia o n a j o i n t strategy w i t h the W o r l d B a n k G roup (the CPS)

mu l t i la tera ls . Cu r ren t ly about 25% o f DFID Nigeria’s budget f lows through mu l t i la tera ls , inc lud ing 
the W o r l d B a n k and UN agencies. This accounts fo r about 40% o f DFID’s support on human 
development. 

I D A Country Financing Parameters 

131. 
The coun t ry f inanc ing parameters fo r N ige r ia have been prepared and agreed upon b y the 
government (see Annex 6). With regard to cost sharing, g iven the Government’s strong comm i tmen t 
to i t s development program, the W o r l d Bank may finance up to 100% o f p ro jec t costs in N ige r ia . 
These funds w i l l be disbursed to projects selectively, o n a case-by-case basis. The W o r l d Bank ’s 
f inanc ing share wou ld be moderate in key economic in fras truc ture sectors f o r example in power, 
roads and transport, and especially in projects invo lv ing comme rc ia l parastatals. Projects in other 
sectors cou ld be f inanced up to 100% depending o n clear assessment and me r i t . 

132. Recurrent Cost Financing. The W o r l d Bank w i l l also finance recurren t costs on projects. 
This w i l l be app l ied selectively in order no t to compromise f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty or the achievement o f 
ind iv idua l p ro jec t development objectives. G iven the W o r l d Bank ’s sma l l share o f to ta l pub l ic 
f inanc ing in N iger ia , this increased f lex ib i l i ty w i l l no t compromise f isca l sus ta inab i l i ty at the macro 
level. The W o r l d Bank w i l l continue to mon i to r the f isca l and debt s i tua t ion in states, and the i r 
imp l ica t ions f o r recurrent costs financing. Fo r ind iv idua l projects, recurren t costs f inanc ing may be 
a l lowed to de fray the cost o f managing pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . The new approach in the CPS, 
whereby the bulk o f the W o r l d Bank ’s assistance w i l l be to a f ew core states tha t meet cer ta in c r i te r ia 
and demonstrate pruden t f isca l and budget management and a t ten t ion to fiscaVdebt sustainability, 
should p rov ide add i t iona l safeguards. 

133. 
Local Cost Financing. N iger ia ’s f inanc ing requirements c lea r ly exceed the coun try ’s ow n 
resources, even tak ing i n t o account i t s domestic bo r row ing poss ib i l i t ies . W h i l e in terna t iona l o i l prices 
have reached h is tor ic highs in the last fou r years, revenue receipts are ou twe ighed b y the costs o f 
financing development and the need to accumulate external reserves to cush ion against fu ture adverse 
shocks to the economy. In addition, the f inanc ing o f on ly fo re ign expenditures w i l l n o t be su f f ic ien t 
fo r the W o r l d Bank to p rov ide the requ ired resources to projects t o meet the i r development objectives. 
Several projects in the N ige r ia po r t fo l io are in the social sec to rs4ommun i ty development, agr icu l ture 
and urban development-where expenditures are large ly loca l . I t i s also l i k e l y tha t the CPS’s p ipe l ine 
projects w i l l requ ire substantial contracting o f loca l goods and services. There fore the W o r l d Bank 
w i l l finance loca l costs and fo re ign costs in any propor t ions needed and as appropriate f o r ind iv idua l 
projects . 
134. 
Taxes and Duties. N iger ia ’s domestic tax rates are reasonable, tax adm in is tra t ion i s be ing 
strengthened and the federal Government plans t o move to the E C OW A S CET w h i c h w i l l ins t i tu te a 
four band t a r i f f structure (5, 10, 15 and 20). However , impo r t duties o n goods typ ica l ly impo r ted 
under W o r l d Bank-financed projects are generally under 10%. Thus the W o r l d Bank may n ow 
finance a l l taxes and duties15. The W o r l d Bank would, however, consider at the ind iv idua l pro jec t-

Box 14: Outcome-Based Management 

There are three key features o f the CPS which need to be reflected i n the organization for implementation and monitoring team: (i) t h e 
DFID/WB Group partnership; (i) outcome focus; and (hi) lead states approach. A joint management arrangement w i l l therefore be 
established and w i l l comprise a joint management team, joint outcome teams led by Outcome Coordinators, joint lead state teams and a 
partnership coordinator. Although the detailed descriptions of the management arrangement are s t i l l in progress, the following are key 
features: 
The Outcome Team (OT) w i l l be cross-sectoral and include WB Group and DFID staff relevant to the achievement of the 
Outcomes. It i s conceivable that one person may be in more than one team. 
The Outcome Coordinator (OC) w i l l lead the Outcome Team. S h e may be a Program Coordinator or Team Leader in addition to 
taking on the function of OC. There w i l l be one OC for each Outcome Platform and s h e may come from either o f the Partners. 
S h e w i l l ensure that the team shares a vision of the national strategic objectives and the alignment o f the CPS with them, 
coordinates monitoring of outcome/ milestones, ensures that t h e partnership between DFID and t h e World Bank (and other 
donors) works effectively towards outcomes and that i t includes the sustained participation o f t h e Government CPS counterpart 
team. 
Lead State Teams (UT) w i l l be cross-sectoral and include relevant WB Group and DFID staff. T h e LST w i l l be canying out the 
policy dialogue in lead states, based on SEEDS and w i l l identify investment gaps and activities. 
The partnership coordinator w i l l be responsible for coordinating CPS activities with those o f other donors and working to 
facilitate donor harmonization. As the partnership broadens to include other donors, the outcome-based management 
arrangements w i l l also evolve. T h i s w i l l need to be carefully managed and monitored, using the Paris Declaration commitments 
as guiding principles. 

144. 
The CPS p rog ram effectiveness w i l l need to be assessed f r o m the outset. There i s much to 
learn . about w h i c h kinds o f outcomes create the best cond i t ions fo r p roduc ing strategic results. 
Because this cannot wa i t fo r ex post evaluation, intensive ex ante, se l f-eva lua t ion methods w i l l need 
to be used throughou t the CPS period. The na t iona l MDG mon i to r ing system i s un l ike ly t o be f u l l y 
operational at the outset o f this CPS and, even when i t become operational, i t w i l l n o t mon i to r a l l CPS 
performance indicators. The CPS w i l l therefore establish an i n i t i a l M&E lea rn ing based system t o 
track progress and guide performance improvement in co l labora t ion w i t h Governmen t counterparts. 

145. Quar ter ly W o r l d Bank G r o u p D F I D strategy meetings w i l l rev iew p rog ram imp lemen ta t ion 
and progress towards achieving outcomes. Semi-annuallannual j o i n t CPPR (W o r l d Bank/DFID/ 
Government) w i l l be aligned w i t h the results framework, assessing progress in ach iev ing CPS 
outcomes, dea l ing w i t h risks and problems that might h inder achievement, iden t i fy ing systemic issues 
that may a f fec t po r t fo l io performance and fac i l i ta t ing mu tua l accoun tab i l i ty . At m id- term , the CPS 
Progress Repor t w i l l draw on an in-dep th examination o f the CPS outcomes and assess whether they 
rema in relevant t o the longer- term objectives, g iven coun try cond i t ions . A Comp le t ion Repor t w i l l be 
completed at the end o f the CPS imp lemen ta t ion to feed in to the nex t CPS cyc le . 

Communications Strategy 

146. 
The comp le t ion o f the CPS w i l l p rov ide the founda t ion f o r an in tens i f ied commun ica t ions 
strategy in N iger ia . Tha t strategy w i l l a im to communicate an accurate and up-to-date understanding 
o f the W o r l d Bank and i t s ro le in N iger ia ; wh i le in parallel, building an understanding o f DFID and 
the nature o f partnership fo r g row th and pover ty reduction. I t w i l l take f o rw a r d the co l labora t ive 
re la t ionsh ip established w i t h stakeholders during CPS consultations. 

147. 
The CPS w i l l f i rs t be disseminated and discussed w i t h op in ion leaders f r o m fou r key groups: 
academics, the media, parliamentarians, and the p r iva te sector. Since the CPS i s necessarily a “ l i v i n g 
strategy,’’ tak ing shape as i t i s put in to practice, these discussions w i l l con t inue so that key actors in 
a l l fou r target groups are aware o f results on the ground and h o w the W o r l d Bank , DFID and the ir 
partners are mee t ing emerg ing challenges. Meanwh i le , an expanded ne two rk o f Pub l ic In fo rma t ion 
Centers - in Abu ja and in other key urban centers - i s to p rov ide a p l a t f o rm f o r d issem ina t ing the CPS 
and discussing i t s ma in elements. 

148. 
B road ly the three p i l la rs o f the CPS - strengthening governance and transparency, advanc ing 
g row th in the non -o i l economy and imp rov ing pub l ic service de l ive ry f o r human development -

shou ld become a focus fo r development debate in the country; team members shou ld he lp t o i n f o r m a 
na t iona l d ia logue on these cruc ia l issues. An expanded communications e f fo r t shou ld strengthen and 
deepen understanding o f the development program in N iger ia , building a more conduc ive c l ima te f o r 
success. 

149. This p rog ram promises high returns but i s n o t w i thou t r i s k s . F i v e s ign i f ican t r i s k s threaten the 
success o f the p rog ram and The W o r l d Bank and DFID are comm i t ted to suppor t ing N i g e r i a in 
reduc ing them. F i rs t , domestic po l i t ica l support fo r re forms cou ld evaporate, remov ing any poss ib i l i ty 
that the momen tum created b y the Econom ic Team w i l l surv ive the 2007 pres iden t ia l elections. The 
CPS tries t o m i t iga te this risk by : (i) he lp ing the executive and legislature build consensus and 
translate re fo rms i n t o leg is la t ion (e.g. procurement, EITI, and f isca l respons ib i l i ty bills); (ii) 
demonstrating the in terna t iona l community’s strong support fo r reforms, inc lud ing th rough deb t r e l i e f 
and increased f inanc ia l flows; (iii) p rov id ing on-go ing support t o ana ly t ica l w o r k on debt, as 
requested; ( iv ) res truc tur ing the po r t fo l io to achieve “qu ick wins”; and (v) he lp ing t o des ign and 
imp lemen t a communications strategy t o trans form basic attitudes about the r o l e o f governmen t and 
c iv ic society and increasing the demand fo r outcomes. The CPS w i l l wo rk t o p romo te b road na t iona l 
dialogue o n key issues such as service delivery, the management o f o i l resources and non -o i l g row th . 
This w i l l he lp to raise awareness among citizens o f the ir rights to oversee government comm i tmen ts 
in budgets and p lans and to a qua l i ty o f services commensurate w i t h the resources available. 

150. 
Second, N iger ia ’s great ethnic and re l ig ious d ivers i ty carries an inherent risk o f c o n f l i c t that 
has the po ten t ia l to jeopardize development e f for ts . Con f l ic ts in N ige r ia are la rge ly caused b y 
compe t i t ion f o r resources. Fo r example, the con f l ic t in the N i g e r De l ta i s a re f lec t ion o f the desire 
among De l ta inhabitants to re ta in a larger share o f the o i l wea l th produced in the ir reg ion . The con f l ic t 
in Plateau State began as a result o f a dispute between pastoralists and farmers over access t o land. 
Leaders o f ten use ethnic and re l ig ious differences as a way o f j u s t i f y i n g d iv is ive actions and pos i t ions 
wh ich they see as furthering the ir objectives; these can exacerbate con f l ic ts . Governmen t and the 
po l i t ica l leadership, starting w i t h President Obasanjo, are m i t iga t ing this risk th rough p o l i t i c a l 
reforms. Conven ing a Na t iona l Counc i l i s an impor tan t step in mode rn iz ing the cons t i tu t ion and the 
lega l system, and remov ing some o f the causes o f con f l ic t . Strengthening democratic ins t i tu t ions i s 
impor tan t in ensuring that d i f feren t groups have vo ice and can in f luence po l i t ica l decisions w i thou t 
resor t ing to violence. B i la te ra l donors are also ac t ive in the security sector, such as po l ice re fo rm . 
The W o r l d Bank and DFID are increasingly 
in t roduc ing con f l ic t avoidance and reso lu t ion 
mechanisms in the ir projects. F o r example, the Fadama p ro jec t includes spec i f ic mechanisms to 
resolve con f l ic ts over land use. At the same time, the W o r l d B a n k i s suppor t ing the e f fo r ts o f o i l 
companies to establish outreach programs t o bene f i t commun i t ies in o i l -p roduc ing areas. 

15 1. 

Th i rd i s the risk posed by weak institutions, poo r governance and widespread conup t ion . The 
Government’s recent and decisive actions against corrup t ion , and i t s ongo ing comm i tmen t t o building 
pub l ic support fo r i t s an t i-corrup t ion measures, have reduced this risk. At the same time, the CPS 
wants to imp rove pub l ic adm in is tra t ion at the federal and state leve ls and the capacity o f c i v i l society 
and loca l communities to demand change. The selection o f lead states a l lows the CPS to build state 
capacity, avo id dispersion and ga in synergy across operations t o produce i r reve rs ib le results o n the 
ground. B y the end o f the pe r iod the selected states w o u l d be assessed and are expected to become 
e l ig ib le fo r budget financing. The experience o f the lead states w o u l d be transferred gradua l ly t o 
other states. The strategy i s f lex ib le in the a l loca t ion o f resources t o accommodate the speed and 
qua l i ty o f imp lemen ta t ion in projects o r states and/or any drastic shift in the basic economic 
parameters.

152. 
Fourth , the incentives f o r states to engage w i t h a re fo rm agenda have been weak, w i t h the 
comm i tmen t t o re fo rm at state-level large ly dependent on the pred ispos i t ion o f the governor. This 
inherent f rag i l i ty may increase after the 2007 elections, when at least 20 n ew governors w i l l be 
elected. Comm i tmen t to re fo rm has already proved problematic w i t h regard t o W o r l d B a n k and DFID 
support t o some states. The Government has recognized this as a risk t o na t iona l development. I t s 
w o r k on ,po l i t ica l reform, the f isca l respons ib i l i ty B i l l and the SEEDS benchma rk ing process are 
no tab le examples o f concrete steps i t has taken to ease this problem. The CPS w i l l l o o k t o support 
such in i t ia t ives wherever possible. W h i l e the po l i t ica l economy risk at state l e v e l rema ins high, 
incentives w i l l be introduced to encourage state governors t o build a cons t i tuency f o r imp roved 
service delivery, transparency and accountability. The lead state approach, i n c l u d i n g the f l e x i b i l i t y to 
w i thdraw , w i l l con tr ibu te to m i t iga t ing this risk. 

153. 
F@h, N iger ia ’s economy remains vulnerable t o o i l pr ice shocks. A sharp f a l l in o i l prices 
wou ld increase the f inanc ing gaps and make i t much more d i f f i c u l t to achieve the p rog ram objectives, 
especially those re la t ing to the MDGs. The Government, w i t h techn ica l suppor t f r o m the IMF, i s 
addressing this b y deve lop ing a macro-economic framework that expressly takes i n t o account o i l pr ice 
vo la t i l i ty . B y basing spending decisions on the long-run p r ice o f o i l , N i g e r i a i s building reserves 
when market prices are high that w i l l be used when the prices fa l l . The W o r l d B a n k and DFID are 
also he lp ing Government to reduce this risk b y wo rk ing w i t h other donors to ensure that adequate and 
f lex ib le f inanc ing i s made available to the N ige r ia program. 

154. Working in partnership i s n o t w i thou t i t s ow n peculiar r i s k s . W h i l e b o t h the W o r l d Bank 
and DFID curren t ly have excellent relations w i t h the Government, there i s a r i s k tha t this may change, 
pa r t icu la r ly after 2007. The partners w i l l need to ma in ta in pos i t ive engagement w i t h t h i s and any 
fu ture administration. Where th is proves problematic, the W o r l d Bank w i l l m i n im i z e exposure b y 
shifting to a low-case scenario wh ich recovers much operational con t ro l o f resources f r om 
government hands and shifts investment to non-government agencies do ing commun i ty development 
w o r k towards MDGs. DFID wou ld also rev iew i t s a l loca t ion t o consider whe ther i t can con t inue to 
demonstrate impact. As w i t h the W o r l d Bank, i t w i l l shift resources f r o m Gove rnmen t support t o 
securing more d irec t impacts through c i v i l society organizations and the p r iva te sector, wh i le 
in tens i fy ing wo rk o n the demand side o f governance around key issues. 

155. During the CPS period, the W o r l d Bank and DFlD w i l l w o r k t o strengthen the par tnersh ip - 
recogn iz ing that this i s an area open to some risk g iven the differences in the t w o organizations, the ir 
procedures and a id instruments. Jo in t imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing team arrangements (see 
B o x 14) has been de f ined and a Partnership Coord ina tor w i l l be assigned - using a Partnership 
Results Framework gu ided b y Paris Dec lara t ion indicators (see Annex 7) - t o manage this risk wh i le 
deve lop ing partnerships w i t h the UN and others. Outcome Team charters cu t t ing across partner 
agencies w i l l be established t o de f ine the v is ion and norms fo r j o i n t de l ive ry o f outcomes and fur ther 
deve lop ing j o i n t programming. A n ew l y established j o i n t management team w i l l meet pe r iod ica l ly 
w i t h the Government and convene regu lar ly to mon i to r the de l ive ry o f resu l ts and progress o n the 
partnership. 

156. A m id- term rev iew o f the CPS (by end o f F Y 0 7 ) w i l l a l l ow the partners t o take s tock o f the 
progress made towards ach iev ing the outcomes, propose appropriate rev is ions and in t roduce greater

Executive Summary 

1. 
This Comp le t ion Repor t (CR) takes stock o f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the past Jo in t I n t e r im 
strategies fo r N iger ia . I t s assessment and conclusions have in fo rmed the p repa ra t ion o f this Coun try 
Partnership Strategy (CPS). When the Bank came back to N ige r ia in 1999, as a democ ra t ica l ly elected 
government took power, several factors handicapped the extent and qua l i ty o f i t s support: (i) lack o f 
qua l i ty ana ly t ica l work, due t o disengagement f r o m the country; (ii) b road and un -p r io r i t ized 
Government po l icy guidelines; (iii) s ign i f ican t ins t i tu t iona l de ter iora t ion a f ter two decades o f m i l i ta ry 
rule; and ( iv ) lack o f a comprehensive evaluation o f the prev ious B a n k exper ience . Unde r these 
circumstances, Bank assistance was o f ten opportunistic, dispersed, and n o t s t ruc tu red around c lear ly 
ar t icu la ted mon i torab le objectives. 

2. 

W i t h time, however, and despite a re la t ive ly young po r t fo l io , s ign i f ican t achievements have

However, attempts to assist a large number o f states w i t h i n a s ing le p r o j e c t f o r the de l ive ry

greater emphasis on o i l as a d r ive r in the economic trans forma t ion o f the c o u n t r y th rough the various

Some key lessonshecommendations f r om the CR are: 

At the Strategic Level: 

Concentrate assistance in pockets o f high comm i tmen t l i k e the Federa l government and a few 
selected states 
Stress AAA as the basis fo r a scaled-up po l icy dialogue and imp roved p ro jec t preparation. 
Leverage Bank assistance against Government resources and those of other donors by 
con t inued support fo r the improvement in the management o f pub l ic resources 
Use the oppor tun i ty o f a Coun try Partnership Strategy t o develop rea l is t ic c r i te r ia t o assess 
progress in N iger ia . 
Increase support to remove the barriers t o economic g row th as a means t o reduce pover ty 
na t ionw ide (infrastructure, macro-grow th links) 
Do n o t l i m i t assistance t o the management o f energy resources but rather exp lore the 
po ten t ia l d irec t contributions the energy sector can make t o economic grow th , as i t i s n ow 
be ing exp lored in the case o f gas. 
M a i n t a i n a produc t ive engagement in the coun try and make sure that the in terven t ions can

I. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS-OUTCOMES 

4. 

The incom ing c i v i l i a n adm in is tra t ion in 1999 sought a s ign i f ican t reversa l o f fortunes in a 
w ide range o f fronts: h igher economic growth, imp roved governance, arresting the de ter iora t ion o f 
basic social indicators, and better management o f o i l resources. The progress has been s low due 
ma in ly t o the s ign i f ican t ins t i tu t iona l deterioration that had taken place; however, pos i t ive changes 
are clear and evident, especially a f ter 2003, when the c i v i l i a n government was reelected. Econom ic 
g row th has p icked up; the macroeconomic s i tua t ion has been stabilized; and, the s tock o f in terna t iona l 
reserves has increased. M o s t impor tan t ly , the Government o f N ige r ia has produced a home -g rown 
development strategy (NEEDS) and has taken a fo rce fu l stance in fighting co r rup t ion and im p r o v i n g 
governance. These developments are reported in greater de ta i l in the m a i n tex t o f the CPS. 

11. INTERIM STRATEGY OUTCOMES 

5 . 

This chapter evaluates the impac t o f the B a n k assistance f r o m 1999 t o the present. The B a n k 
Boa rd last discussed a C A S in April 1993. Since the democra t ica l ly elected Obasanjo adm in is tra t ion 
took powe r in 1999, the Boa rd considered an I n t e r im Coun t ry Strategy N o t e dated M a y 11,2000. An

I n t e r im Coun ty Assistance Update dated M a y 21, 2001 and an I n t e r im Strategy Upda te dated 
February 13,2002 fo l lowed . The Second Jo in t I n t e r im Strategy Progress Repo r t was considered b y 
the Boa rd in June 2004. 

The I n t e r im Coun try Strategy No te and the fo l low -up updates targeted assistance t o three objectives: 

Imp rov ing governance and economic management 
Suppor t ing economic g row th 
Empowermen t o f the popu la t ion through better services. 

6. 
Moreover , the 2002 JIS mandated focused attention to Lagos. The f o l l ow i n g p re l im ina ry 
observations p rov ide a framework fo r understanding the achievements and l im i ta t ions o f assistance t o 
N ige r ia during this period. They also i l lus tra te the d i f f icu l t ies w i t h assessing achievements and 
impac t in N iger ia . 

7. 

The Government’s Development Strategy has emerged more clearly only towards the end 

of the period. A f te r com ing t o power the c iv i l ian adm in is tra t ion was n o t in a pos i t ion to deve lop a 
de ta i led development strategy; i t lacked the supporting ana ly t ica l w o r k and the techn ica l capacity t o 
d o so. Furthermore, the Bank lacked ana ly t ica l w o r k to guide i t s ow n p rog ram and p ro jec t designs. 
N E ED S wou ld no t be developed u n t i l 2004. In the absence o f c lear ly defines spec i f ic objectives and 
targets, i t has been d i f f i c u l t fo r the Bank to evaluate the effectiveness o f the p rog ram in the various 
updates o f the I n t e r im Strategy. The lack o f clear targets has led to subjective and nega t ive 
evaluations b y the donor commun i ty o f progress made in changing ins t i tu t ions in N ige r ia . The donor 
commun i ty p laced too high expectations on what the c i v i l i a n government cou ld do. 1 

The Bank did not take stock of the lessons from past involvements on a timely basis. The 

8. 
B a n k had been very active in N ige r ia during the 1980s and ear ly 1990s2, cove r ing health, education, 
roads, agriculture, electricity, water and sanitation. However, OED did no t carry out a Coun t ry 
Assistance Evaluation; therefore, a comprehensive rev iew o f the prev ious B a n k invo lvemen t was 
a ~ a i l a b l e . ~ The available in fo rma t ion suggests a l im i t e d impac t w i t h past in terven t ions . 4Arguab ly , 
the l a c k o f a proper evaluation w o r k has hindered the effectiveness o f the current assistance. Some of 
the past lessons had t o be learned again. 

9. 

Very few resources have been disbursed. The B a n k po r t fo l io in N ige r ia i s f a i r l y young and 
available resources have been disbursed s low ly ; therefore, i t i s too early to evaluate the full impac t on 
the ground o f these on-going interventions. 

A. Improving Governance and Economic Management 

10. 
A f t e r a decade o f arbitrary and corrup t m i l i ta ry rule, the ins t i tu t iona l decay in the pub l ic 
sector was pervasive. “Standard procedures in government that he lp ensure good p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion , 
imp lemen ta t ion and accoun tab i l i ty have been igno red f o r so l o n g that they have been la rge ly 

’ The IMF and DFID have made a similar point in the assessment o f their own interventions. 
In the 1980’s the lending portfolio stood at 1 billion dollars a year. 
OED , however, evaluated 8 projects launched before the Bank suspended i t s program in 1995. 
A n internal study o f 2 0 projects initiated between 1985 and 1992 found that 52% were unsatisfactory in terms 
o f impact andor sustainability and 85% o f the projects reviewed had negative sustainability ratings. 
Table 4 o f the appendix shows that only 18 percent o f the committed resources have been disbursed. In fact 
only, two projects approved during this period w i l l have been completed by the end o f F Y 0 5 .

forgotten.”6 Understandably, the Government gave early p r io r i ty to imp rov ing governance and 
reduc ing corruption. Donors, the Bank included’, have p rov ided support th rough ana ly t ica l w o r k and 
techn ica l assistance. The progress has been s ign i f ican t since 1999. The government has been the 
d r i v i n g force beh ind these in i t ia t ives and has had full ownership. The f o l l ow i n g advances can be 
noted: 

11. 
Public procurement shows results. F o l l ow i n g the CPAR o f 2000, the Federa l Government 
has made progress in imp lemen t ing procurement reform. The Budge t M o n i t o r i n g and P r ice 
In te l l igence U n i t (BMPIU), wh ich i s located in the Presidency, has ins t i tu ted “due process” f o r a l l 
contracts and generated s ign i f ican t savings t o t h e budget. I t has issued c ircu lars d i rec t ing the creation 
o f a procurement cadre and the establishment o f procurement units in each Ministry, Depar tmen t o r 
Agency, e f fec t ive ly decentralizing procurement. A Procurement B i l l has been subm i t ted to the 
Na t iona l Assembly. F o l l ow i n g enactment o f the Procurement Bill, a Bu reau o f Pub l ic Procurement 
w i l l be created wh ich w i l l oversee procurement po l icy , ensure quality, launch a b road procurement 
t ra in ing program, and carry ou t procurement audits. A Lagos State Procurement Assessment Rev iew 
was carr ied out in 2003 and makes s im i lar recommendations f o r procurement r e f o rm at the State 
leve l . However , at this stage, imp lemen ta t ion has been s low due to unava i lab i l i ty o f adequate fund ing 
(e.g. IDA funding). 

12. 
Management of Oil resources i s improving. Progress has been made in the management o f 
o i l resources. A pr ice o i l ru le to smooth expenditure in the federal budget was in t roduced in 2004. 
This decision represents a f i r s t step in what can be a more sophisticated macroeconom ic management. 
The coun try can move, f o r instance, to using the non -o i l f isca l de f ic i t as key c r i te r ia f o r 
macroeconomic management. These e f for ts have to be extended t o the state l e v e l f o r the approach to 
be even more effective. The proposed F isca l Respons ib i l i ty B i l l wou ld a l low the federa l and the state 
governments to coordinate f isca l and budgetary po l icy . 

13. 
The government has begun imp lemen ta t ion o f the Ex t rac t ive Industry Transparency In i t ia t ive 
(EITI.) I t s e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion wou ld pu t N ige r ia at the fo re f ron t o f o i l coun tr ies in in t roduc ing

External Control and accountability to Parliament. The federal government has brough t i t s 

15. 
f isca l accounts to date and several states are beg inn ing t o d o the same. Aud i ted f inanc ia l statements 
have been published. The Aud i to r General's o f f ice has made progress towards repo r t ing to

Some 138 func t iona l An t i -Co r rup t ion Units have been created in government agencies. Since 2003, a 
large number o f h igh ly placed government o f f ic ia ls have been taken t o court, inc lud ing ministers,

magnitude o f the challenge ahead fo r the Government, the coun try and the donor commun i ty , and the 
need to mon i to r con t inuous ly the outcomes o f the interventions. 

B. Supporting Economic G row th 

17. 
G r ow t h o f the non -o i l economy during the 1990s was around 3 % p.a., ma rg ina l ly above 
popu la t ion growth. In this decade, non -o i l g row th has increase t o an average o f 4.7 % annually. The 
new c i v i l i a n government sought to move the coun try away f r o m the prev ious strategy o f 
indus tr ia l iza t ion based o n d irec t state investments towards re l iance on p r iva te sector in i t ia t ive . The 
Government and the Bank, lack ing the supporting ana ly t ica l background t o des ign a de ta i led g row th 
strategy, proceeded tentatively, w i t h emphasis o n enterprise pr iva t iza t ion , deregulation, and SOEs 
restructuring. A more de ta i l p rog ram has been un fo ld ing over t ime . With hindsight, the support f o r 
economic g row th cou ld have bene f i ted f r om earlier and more in tens ive sector w o r k and a mo re active 
dialogue w i t h government o n issues o f business env ironmen t and sources f o r growth.' A lso , greater 
attention should shave been g iven to energy resources as dr ivers o f economic change th rough fo rwa rd 
and backwards linkages. On ly , gas received some attention towards the end o f the period. 

18. 

The understanding of how oil impacts economic growth has improved. The understanding 

o f h ow o i l revenues f l o w i n t o the economy has imp roved as a resu l t o f j o i n t ana ly t ica l w o r k be tween 
the Bank and the Government." The use o f an o i l-pr ice-ru le f o r the budget prepara t ion fo l lows f rom 

38% in total commitments have been made to support economic growth. The percentage drops to 31% i f the 
Fadama project (based on a CDD approach) i s omitted.

(2003) and Poverty and Vu lnerab i l i ty (2004). 

Page 5 o f 23 

Annex 2 

the understanding that fluctuations in o i l revenues have negative effects on economic growth. The 
commitment to transparency in the f low o f o i l revenues highlights the importance o f check and 
balances to prevent opportunities for graft and m isuse o f resources. Also, there i s greater clarity about 
the economic opportunities that derive f rom gas, and the current losses and environmental r i s k s f rom 
gas flaring. Moreover, the legal framework to allow private sector involvement in gas i s under 
preparation. Desp i te some progress i t i s necessary to continue the work on the l i n k s between o i l and 
the economy, especially by bringing these issues into the national dialogue on development. I t i s also 
worthwhile to explore opportunities that the o i l industry directly provides fo r the development o f 
local industry. 11 

There is now a better understanding of the requirements for a high rate of sustained 

19. 
growth. Through analysis, dialogue and surveys, the Government, the private sector and the donors 
have an improved understanding o f the barriers to growth, and a sense o f policy priorities has been 
emerging regarding infrastructure, the investment climate, trade and the overall determinants o f 
productivity growth.'* Regretfully, at the present moment there i s not enough o f a track record w i t h 
surveys to know i f the environment has been improving in recent years as a result o f government 
policy. However, the basis has been set to track this progress in the future. An up-coming Country 
Economic Memorandum provides the opportunity to bring together the wo rk that has been done on 
the determinants o f competitiveness in Nigeria. The Bank, jo in t ly w i th DFID, has been supporting 
private sector organizations to dialogue w i th Government on issues o f investment climate. The 
dialogue on growth needs to be scaled-up to motivate national wide debate on the barriers to growth. 

20. 

De-regulation of the telecommunications sector has been very effective. The 

telecommunications sector has been liberalized, a regulator has been put in place, and tele-density has 
increased f rom .4 percent in December 1999 to over 6.5 percent in December 2004. The regulatory 
framework i s state-of-the art. The response o f the private investors has been remarkable. Private 
investments rose f rom $50 m i l l ion at end-1999 to $5.4 b i l l i o n at end-2004, so that the sector i s second 
only to o i l in FDI. This shows in equivocally that the private sector can play a positive ro le in the 
economy. The I FC largest investment in Nigeria i s in telecommunications. The National Monopo ly 
(NITEL) i s being prepared for privatization now. 

21. 

Signifxant progress has been made to improve delivery of electricity services. Reportedly, 

the quality o f the electricity services i s the largest barrier to business in Nigeria. Some improvements 
in service delivery have been made, through the restructuring o f NEPA (the state electricity 
monopoly)--its distribution sector being unbundled in to 11 Distribution Business Units - DBUs (as o f 
Jan 1,2004) and the Transmission Business U n i t has been set up on April 2,2004. Several initiatives 
have been piloted under the Commercial Reorientation o f the Electricity Too lk i t (CREST) program. 
Based on the success o f the pilots, a scale-up program in 8 o f the 11 DBUs i s being undertaken. With 
the passage o f the Energy B i l l (December, 2004), i t i s now possible to unbundle de facto the state 
energy company (NEPA) and engage the private sector in the electricity sector. I FC has been actively 
cooperating w i th the Bank in the re fo rm o f the electricity sector, including preparing the basis fo r 
private sector o f f -g r id investments. Rapid progress i s needed in improving the quality o f electricity 
delivery and extending the coverage throughout the country. 

Privatization has proceeded at a pace slower than initially expected. The Bank and the 

22. 
Government placed a high p r io r i ty on privatization as part o f a growth agenda, wh ich emphasized 

I ' Past efforts in this area did not work satisfactorily. For instance, some o f the refineries are not under operation 
and the country imports gasoline. 
l2 The Bank has produced several private sector assessments and also i s now working on better understanding 
the determinants o f competitiveness, by focusing on value chains. This work i s expected to inform the CEM. 

Page 6 o f 23 

Annex 2 

active private sector participation in the economy. Progress has been very slow. With hindsight, the 
slow progress in involving the private sector in infrastructure service p r o ~ i s i o n ' ~ appears reasonable, 
given (a) the need to provide solid supporting regulatory frameworks upfront and (b) the weak 
international market for basic network telecommunications companies. Slow progress in privatizing 
companies in the productive sectors seems less reasonable, and i s probably due t o entrenched interests 
and lack o f a strong government commitment. The Bank operation supporting privatization has been 
restructured and lower goals were set. I t may we l l have been that the early emphasis on privatization 
proved premature, and a better understanding o f the political economy was necessary. As o f recently, 
the privatization drive has gained momentum. Progress has been made w i th preparing ports, airports 
(starting w i th Abuja) and railway concessions. Also important assets in telecommunications and the 
o i l sector, including refineries, reportedly w i l l be put up for sale. 

T h e Bank re tu rned to agr icu lture w i th a delay. Prior to 1999, the Bank had been actively 

23. 
involved in agriculture. After 1999,14 the Bank took the conscious decision not t o lend fo r 
investments in agriculture until fiduciary issues, related to previous Bank operations, were sorted out. 
A t the same time, the Bank undertook Rural Sector Strategy Study and other analytical work; 
regretfully, their impact on either policy or lending was very limited. A new agricultural sector review 
i s under preparation. The return to lending under FADAMA-I1 emphasizes a C D D approach t o 
address concerns f rom the previous FADAMA-I operation, as conflicts arose amongst different 
beneficiaries at the community level. The CDD approach for the delivery o f agriculture services i s 
experimental, and, henceforth, impact monitoring w i l l be highly important. 

24. 
Also, i t i s recommendable that FADAMA-I1 concentrates on productive investments and 
coordinates w i th efforts to improve rural roads. The previous FADAMA project succeeded in raising 
yields, but products could not be taken to the market because o f lack o f transportation. With 
hindsight, the Bank's support to agriculture could have been more forceful in (a) developing a more 
precise diagnosis and p r io r i ty actions fo r the sector, and (b) carrying out an effective po l icy dialogue 
w i th the government. A more active dialogue could have encouraged the government t o undertake 
more determined actions to introduce some dynamism in to agriculture. The Bank cou ld have found an 
alternative way to address the fiduciary concerns. 

25. 

Support Economic Growth through focus on Lagos State. Lagos concentrates a large share 

o f non-oil economic activity in Nigeria. Support fo r the development o f Lagos has a national impact. 
The 2002 JIS focused on Lagos. The ensuing support has provided the analytical basis to improve the 
public expenditure and procurement practices. Lagos has increased collection o f loca l taxes 
significantly. The Bank i s also supporting improvements to the transport system, inc lud ing roads and 
the port. Regretfully, this assistance has been hindered by a failure o f coordination between the 
federal and the state authorities regarding roads under federal responsibility. Project design should 
have taken into account o f the possible consequence o f the division o f responsibilities o f t h e state and 
federal government. The Bank i s likewise supporting the preparation o f a Development and Poverty 
Reduction Strategy. Lessons f rom the interventions in Lagos w i l l need to be studied carefully as the 
Bank moves to work more directly w i t h other states. 

The workings of the f inanc ia l sector have improved, but access continues to be a problem. 

26. 
The Bank jo in t ly w i th the IMF supported analytical work in the financial sector through FSAP . The 
Central Bank has already begun implementation o f several o f the FSAP recommendations, taking 
steps to strengthen banking regulation. IFC has worked w i th six commercial Banks, comm i t t ing term

The incom ing Government found a disastrous situation: poo r p r ima ry hea l th care services; 
the prevalence of communicable deceases; nu t r i t ion deficiencies; l im i t e d ava i lab i l i ty o f potable water; 
and coverage o f p r ima ry education s l igh t ly above 60 percent b y the end o f the 1990s. HIV/AIDS was

Learn ing to work with and through the communities. The emphasis o n Commun i ty D r i v e n 

Deve lopmen t (CDD) was new. Through t h i s approach, the Government and the B a n k have sought to 
l7 (a) de l iver outcomes o n the ground, such as increases in incomes, pove r ty reduc t ion and access t o 
basic services, and (b) create constituencies f o r the re fo rm o f l o c a l governments. L a c k i n g suppor t ing 
ana ly t ica l work, the Bank re l ied o n the lessons f r om other A f r i c a n countries. Pro jec t design has var ied 
across the CDD operations, wh ich arguably has affected the ir effectiveness.

Results f rom the Commun i ty Pover ty Reduc t ion Project (CPRP) l8 have shown that i t i s

The implementation o f L E EM P and the Urban CDD i s below expectations and w i l l most l ike ly be

besides design issues. For instance, there were delays in taking these projects to the Board. Arguably, these 
delays prevented an earlier and fu l ler implementation o f the C D D strategy.

o n t ime and reach ing i t s intended objectives. This operation was carr ied d i rec t ly by the federa l 
government, the objectives were quite straightforward and the design simple. Reportedly, the OPV 
for ch i ld ren under f i v e has gone up f r om 83% in the base l ine t o 91-95% now . However , WHO 
prov ides m u c h lowe r statistics, at 77-79% and fur ther evaluation i s needed. 

The progress made in improving the delivery of health and education services has been 

30. 
limited. I t i s d i f f i c u l t t o track outcomes in education and hea l th throughout the coun t ry due t o the 
lack o f accurate statistics. However, the Primary Educa t ion Pro jec t I1 (PEP-11) just comp le ted 
generated s ign i f ican t outputs on the ground (a) about 10,OOO primary schools bene f i ted from grants 
f o r self-help improvements based on development plans prepared w i t h commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion ; (b) a 
school based mode l o f teacher professional support was developed; and (c) supplementary read ing 
materials, selected b y teachers, in around 1000 schools were prov ided . Thus, PEP-11 success, a f ter 
res truc tur ing in 2002, contributed to a bo t tom up approach to imp rov ing the educa t iona l system. T o 
assure imp lemen ta t ion o f the Pr imary Educa t ion Project-11 (PEP-11) i t was necessary t o s im p l i f y 
design, skip state governments, and re ly on d irec t transfers to schools and commun i ty par t ic ipa t ion . In 
fact, the self-help component o f this operation was based on a CDD approach and the p ro jec t was 
managed at the federal leve l . However, e f for ts to imp rove the capacity o f the states to manage 
education services have been less successful, as shown b y the performance o f the fo l low -up Un ive rsa l 
Bas ic Educa t ion Pro jec t (UBE.) 

31. 
The 1999 Cons t i tu t ion assigned to states respons ib i l i ty f o r the de l ivery o f soc ia l services. 
Hence, e f fec t ive sustainable interventions to imp rove hea l th and education have t o strengthen the 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the state governments t o manage service de l ivery . Idea l ly , the Federa l 
Government shou ld take the lead in deve lop ing broad ly-owned sector strategies and in providing 
techn ica l assistance t o the states fo r service de l ivery . However, the re la t ions be tween the federa l 
government and the states are strained. The Bank’s attempt t o w o r k d i rec t ly w i t h many states p roved 
daunting, pa r t ly due to rigid and ine f fec t ive pro jec t designs.23 Thus, f o r instance, the resources 
allocated per state per year w i t h i n a pro jec t (UBE) are o f ten sma l l and do n o t p rov ide the necessary 
leverage t o induce the requ ired ins t i tu t iona l changes to imp rove service de l ivery . W h i l e the coverage 
o f numerous states increased supervision e f fo r t and costs, imp lemen ta t ion su f fered because o f the 
unclear respons ib i l i ty o f the federal and state leve l . 

32. With hindsight, an i n i t i a l evaluation o f imp lemen ta t ion r i s k s wou ld have po in ted out: (a) that 
i t i s very cos t ly t o assist many states w i t h i n one project, and (b) that fundamental agreements 
(possibly around a common strategy) between the federal and the state governments are needed t o be 
e f fec t ive in de l ive r ing assistance f o r social services. F o r fu ture effectiveness o f capac i ty building 
e f for ts and ins t i tu t iona l up-grading, the Bank shou ld concentrate i t s w o r k w i t h comm i t ted states. 

Setting the basis for improved delivery of water services. Some Progress was made in 

33. 
imp rov ing de l ivery o f potable water, but achievements o n the g round have fa l len short o f reach ing 
intended objectives. F o r instance, a recent ICR f o r the Sma l l Towns Wa ter Pro jec t h igh l igh ted the 
fac t that the o r ig ina l in ten t to invo lve commun i t ies in the management o f de l ive ry o f water services 
was n o t f u l l y possible, because the federal government did no t transfer ownersh ip o f the assets t o the 
loca l governmen tskommun i t ies . Reportedly, however, the government considers the e f fo r t qu i te 
satisfactory and plans to continue on i t s own, wh ich may p rove the exercise n o t o n l y e f fec t ive but 
sustainable. As t o Bank interventions in large cities, the emphasis has been o n i n v o l v i n g the p r iva te 

the urgency and threat o f AIDS, while not alienating important constituencies sensitive to how the messages on 

AIDS prevention are communicated.

34. 
The Bank supported the government to develop and implement i t s stated priorities. The Bank 
accelerated policy dialogue, AAA and lending as the Government’s re fo rm e f fo r t picked up in 2003. 
Overall, however, the Bank has been cautious in supporting the reform government, raising the 
lending envelops to up to $500 m i l l ion only w i th the 2004 Joint Interim Update. Also, the Bank could 
have move faster and earlier to develop analytical work to support operations and po l icy dialogue. A 
greater effort at dissemination o f analytical work and government achievements was called for. 

A. Quality o f Services 

35. 

Lending Services. F rom a broad perspective, the Bank could have moved more forcefully 
and quicker to support the reform-minded government o f Nigeria. The Bank acted cautiously at the 
beginning, perhaps because o f previous experience. However, i t has been slow in p ick ing up the pace 
in view o f the government’s open commitment to reform. The 2002 JISU update emphasized the 
concept o f a track record and set benchmarks that would eventually place the strategy in a l ow case 
scenario. The 2004 JIT Update was conceived as transitory and d id not depart significantly f o rm the 
past in evaluating the accomplishments and prospects in Nigeria. I t did, however, upgrade the strategy 
to the base case. One o f the key problems that the Bank has faced in Nigeria has been the 
development o f clear benchmarks to assess performance under the present circumstances in Nigeria. 
The tendency has been to expect too much, which may not be warranted on a weak institutional 

environment. T h e consequence has been l im i ted support to a government comm i t ted to re fo rm . 

36. 
As was already pointed out, Bank lending services were dispersed and lacked synergy. This 
has been particularly t rue at the state level, as projects have followed their ow n guidelines in selecting 
states to work with. Additionally, projects sometimes lacked clear and precise development 
objectives, and often proper monitoring and evaluation systems.25 The Bank team has moved to 
address these flaws. This has meant, however, that projects have taken time t o mature and often have 
fallen in to non-performing status. Some o f the initiatives to improve lending services include: 
(i) harmonization and consolidation o f CDD operations; 
(ii) retrofitting management and evaluation initiative; 
(iii) restructuring o f non-performing projects; and 
(iv) re-organization o f projects. 

37. 

W i t h hindsight, the Bank could have acted earlier and more forcefully t o consolidate 
interventions in the strategy and strengthen project design and M&E systems. Some timid initiatives 
were undertaken. The 2002 Joint Interim Strategy Update identification o f Lagos as a p r io r i ty can be 
seen as trying to concentrate efforts in one large and important state. T h e experience w i t h t h i s 

in i t ia t ive i s tha t even in one state, efforts can end up be ing dispersed. Lagos has yet t o develop a 

comprehensive development strategy. Therefore, future targeted interventions at the state leve l have 
to begin w i th development o f vision fo r progress, which can be perfected overtime. The current 
SEEDS initiative could we l l provide such platform. I t has become g radua l ly c lea r to the Bank 

The National Water Project under implementation seeks to invo lve the private sector in the de l ivery o f water 
services.

tha t to be effective in N ige r ia interventions have to be selective, targeted, and, leverag ing pub l ic 
resources. 

38. 
AAA. The Bank sought t o rega in the los t ground and build an adequate know ledge base in 
the country. The AAA has been rather e f fec t ive in o i l , gas, governance, and in iden t i fy ing the 
barriers t o g row th . With some add i t iona l efforts, i t should be possible t o have mo re precise insights 
in to the ques t ion o f how to improve the competitiveness o f the non -o i l economy and upgrade the 
na t iona l d ia logue on growth, use o f o i l resources, and pover ty a l lev ia t ion . S low ly , the know ledge 
base fo r service de l ivery in social sectors has improved, especially in education. There i s also an 
improved understanding o f the pover ty pattems in the country. S ign i f ican t lacunae rema in in: health, 
agriculture, in terna t iona l trade, reg iona l integration, infrastructure, the link be tween non -o i l economy 
and pover ty reduction, po l i t ica l economy, the po ten t ia l f o r the use energy resources f o r growth, etc. 
The fo r thcom ing CEM prov ides the oppor tun i ty to bring together under common ana ly t ica l 
framework e f fo r ts undertaken thus far. 

39. 

However , AAA has n o t always been available t o support lend ing and p o l i c y dialogue. Partly, 
this has been due to the t ime lag in generating know ledge and pa r t ly t o the l a c k o f basic statistical 

in forma t ion . But also, the B a n k has not actively sought to cooperate w i t h other donors in 

knowledge development and sharing. The Bank should have moved mo re aggressively n o t on ly in 
the development of high qua l i ty ana ly t ica l work, but in i t s dissemination. This inc ludes presenting the 
results to the general pub l ic , at home and abroad, w i t h accurate and even-handed evaluations o f the 
programs and achievements o f na t iona l in i t ia t ives . Las t ly , i t i s impo r tan t t o highlight that the last 
C l ien t Survey iden t i f ied ana ly t ica l wo rk as the ma jo r con t r ibu t ion the B a n k c o u l d make to N ige r ia . 

40. 
Country Dialogue. The dialogue w i t h the government began w i t h great expectations as the 
f i r s t democratic government took over power. Then, the dialogue dw ind led . Howeve r , the dialogue 
p icked up after the second e lec t ion (2003.) There are at least t w o reasons that the p o l i c y dialogue i s 
d i f f icu l t in N iger ia . The lack o f background ana ly t ica l w o r k i s c lea r ly a prob lem . Ano the r p rob lem 
arises f r o m the fac t that the Bank o f ten conducts po l icy d ia logue in many countries, especially o n 
macro and g row th issues, around adjustment operations. This i s n o t possible in N ige r ia . The Bank has 
been slow to find alternative avenues. Trying to induce p o l i c y d ia logue and re fo rms through 
investment operations i s d i f f i c u l t and, as in tema t iona l experience shows, o f ten i t does n o t w o r k we l l . 

41. 
In N iger ia , the effectiveness o f the po l icy dialogue has been the h ighes t in the areas o f high 
po l i t ica l commitment-for 
instance, governance and management o f pub l ic resources. In other areas, 
such as non -o i l growth, where there may be a common understanding o f the need t o imp rove the 
business environment o r the qua l i ty o f infrastructure, the barr ier t o effectiveness comes f r o m 
entrenched interests. The Bank cou ld have focused more on he lp ing governmen t iden t i fy the po l i t ica l 
barriers f o r change and build coa l i t ions fo r change. This cou ld have been an op t ion in pr iva t iza t ion . 
Also, at the state level, a more concerted e f for t , perhaps w i t h the concurrence o f o ther donors, cou ld 
have been made to strengthen the reliance o n c i v i l society organizations as key t o generate demand 
fo r change at the loca l levels.

At the strategic Leve l: 

42. 

T h e B a n k needs a strategy on how to ca l ibrate assistance in a d i f f icu l t o r r isky 
environment l ike N ige r ia wh i le ma in ta in ing a product ive engagement. The N i g e r i a experience 

shows that to ta l disengagement f r o m 1995 t o 1999 f r o m N ige r ia had nega t ive consequences, as the 

Page 11 o f 23 

Annex 2 

lack o f updated analytical work and the lack o f a thorough review o f the past interventions reduced 
the effectiveness o f Bank assistance after re-engagement in 1999, leading to dispersed interventions 
and unfocused objectives. Also, i t may have affected the ability o f the Government t o develop a more 
targeted strategy, which the Bank could support. The future strategy needs to guarantee a continued 
basic engagement (analytical work, possible CDD, etc.), even i f the overall assistance were to be 
downsized. Also, i t i s important to select sturdy and sustainable interventions that can withstand the 
vagaries and r i s k s o f future implementation environments. This lesson i s also relevant as we l l fo r the 
direct engagement w i th the states. 

43. 
The Bank should avoid scattered interventions a l l throughout the country and 
concentrate in a few states to be tru ly effective In working w i t h states, the Bank should 

concentrate in a few states and develop modalities o f intervention that assure bo th effective assistance 
and building o f long-term institutions both to improve the quality o f public expenditure and facilitate 
economic growth. In states w i th limited commitment or capacity, the Bank can build C D D 
interventions, w i th simple designs, that work through autonomous management structures to deal 
directly w i t h the communities and bypass local and state bureaucracy. 

44. 
The Bank should target the bu lk of its support to areas in which there i s high level of 
government commitment and actions have been taken o n the ground. This approach has proven 

effective in the areas o f public sector reform, where the analytical work and the technical assistance 
have been effective. Currently, i t makes sense to support the Federal Government where a high leve l 
o f commitment resides. This includes support fo r critical infrastructure, the development o f gas 
resources, transportation, and regulatory and legal reform. Also, i t pays o f f to iden t i fy those states 
where there i s commitment and experience and work directly w i th them and avoid dispersion l i k e in 
the past. Rebalancing o f assistance towards supporting growth related activities seems should be a 
priority. 

45. 

Greater stress should be given to AAA as the basis for policy dialogue and project 

preparations. Continued analytical work i s needed to upgrade the quality o f the dialogue regarding 
how best to use the o i l resources (fiscal management and linkages w i t h domestic industry) and how to 
facilitate non-oil growth especially in agriculture. AAA w i l l be particular importance in working 
directly w i th states and in improving the relationship between the federal government and the states. 
I t i s important to include in this dialogue not just the government but the broad public opinion as we l l 

46. 

The Bank should not shy away of assisting the government in exploring the direct use of 

its energy resources to support growth. Perhaps, because o f past negative experience w i t h direct 
government in industrialization, the Bank has not examined the potential role on energy resources in 
developing the country. Many other o i l countries have benefited f r om the backward and forward 
linkages energy provides. The Bank should assist Nigeria to explore these options. 

47. 

The Bank should seek to leverage its assistance against the government’s resources and 

those o f other donors. The resources the Bank provides are small by comparison to the budgets o f 
the federal and state governments. T o have an impact, the Bank should continue helping the federal 
government and a few selected states improve public expenditure management and service delivery, 
bringing government and donor resources together. 

48. 
The Bank should use the opportunity of a results based Country Partnersh ip Strategy 
to develop criteria, corresponding to institutional capacity and political feasibility, to assess 

progress in Nigeria. I t i s important to be realistic and not generate unreasonable expectations. A 
realistic stance w i l l allow more even-handed evaluations o f the advances made b y the country t o the 
international community. The Bank should likewise not shy away f r om supporting the Government

The incentives f o r states - pa r t icu la r ly the po l i t ica l leaders - t o engage w i t h a r e f o rm agenda have

F ig 1: Emerging State-level Partnership Model: Forms o f Support” 

CPS 

A transformational agenda - Working with a few , ‘lead’ States. Several state governments have 

completed and are imp lemen t ing the ir SEEDS, o r are advanced in the ir preparation, which, 
together w i t h NEEDS f o rm the na t iona l framework o f N iger ia ’s home-grown pove r ty reduc t ion 
strategy. Some states are fighting corruption, strengthening the ir systems and im p r o v i n g service 
delivery, o f ten f r o m a l o w base. The CPS w i l l wo rk w i t h a number o f these ‘lead’ states to 
enable them t o deepen reforms and make more rap id improvements in service de l ive ry . A key 
element o f the strategy i s t o also leverage improvemen ts in the effectiveness and e f f ic iency o f 
pub l ic expenditure to broaden and sustain impac t . This focus and geographical se lec t iv i ty i s a 
rad ica l departure in our way o f work ing , yet one that i s f i rm l y country-led. W o r k i n g w i th a few 
re fo rm ing states was un iversa l ly endorsed during the CPS consultations. State governors and 
the ir o f f ic ia ls in par t icu lar welcomed the focus on the i r plans and pr ior i t ies , ra ther than the ir 
be ing inc luded in an externally-determined pro jec t over wh ich they had l im i t e d con t ro l o r 
commitment. 

The CPS aims to p rov ide incentives fo r a set o f lead states that can demonstrate they are 
comm i t ted to re forms and greater transparency. Thus, the strategy sees i t s impac t in he lp ing 
develop - and reward ing - a number o f ‘models’ o f development and g r ow t h in the lead states. 
The strategy in lead states w i l l also support states to w o r k w i t h loca l governments in deve lop ing 
med ium- term plans. B y wo rk ing t o strengthen accoun tab i l i ty and e f f ic iency o f pub l ic 
expenditures across a l l levels o f government, i t i s expected that b y the end o f this CPS per iod , the 
basis fo r using more f lex ib le instruments fo r assistance, such as budge t support, w i l l be 
established fo r lead states. In this CPS, budget support w i l l n o t be prov ided , though support f o r 
pub l ic expenditure management r e f o rm w i l l enable progress t o be made. Whe re possible, IDA 
and DFID w i l l use SWAPS t o finance social sectors in lead states (where possible, in 
co l labora t ion w i t h other development partners). State leve l engagement w i l l b e in tens i f ied during

Lead State Selection 

Up t o s ix lead states w i l l be selected fo r the CPS. States may be added each year fo r the CPS 
period, depending o n the resource envelope ( inc lud ing that wh ich may be made ava i lab le b y other 
development partners as donor co l labora t ion broadens). 

T w o basic parameters are at the core o f selecting lead states: demand and per formance (Fig. 2). 
States w i l l need to express an interest in cooperation w i t h the B a n k and DFID based on 
transparency, accountability, sound pub l ic resource management and pursuit of the MDGs. The 
government-led SEEDS benchmark ing w i l l indicate states that are comm i t ted t o and demonstrate, 
at a minimum, a satisfactory performance on good governance and service de l ive ry . G iven the 
large number o f states invo lved (28), t h i s process provides a compe t i t ive approach f o r selecting a 
few states and can con tr ibu te to the incentives fo r reform. M a k i n g the SEEDS benchmark ing an 
annual event, where add i t iona l states can enter partnership, w i l l fur ther strengthen incentives.

Comm iss ion and overseen b y the Na t iona l 
Counc i l o n Deve lopmen t P lann ing and the 
Na t iona l Econom ic Counc i l - as a consensus

exercise, signaled in N E ED S as a mechanism fo r setting asp ira t iona l standards f o r pub l ic

f i r s t round o f SEEDS Benchmark ing . The process i s backed b y the in te rna t iona l commun i ty , 
inc lud ing DFID, UNDP, W o r l d Bank, EC, ADB, CIDA. Benchmarks w i l l p rov ide a good

Benchmark ing w i l l be repeated w i t h i n a year, t o measure states’ tra jec tory o f r e f o rm and enable 
others to come o n board. 

The fou r key areas fo r the benchmarks are: 
Policy - ensuring that the state government develops, publishes and imp lemen ts a 
strategy that advances i t s po l icy targets;

b ind ing tool for the implementation o f government priorities; 
Service De l ivery - ensuring government strategies in place to improve service 
delivery, both in terms o f quality and reach; 

Commun icat ion , Transparency and Co r rup t ion - to ascertain that policies are 

planned and implemented in a transparent and accountable manner.

States which d o not have satisfactory performance in the f i r s t year can take effective action to 
raise performance to become eligible in later years, 
fo l low ing subsequent rounds o f 
benchmarking. States on the shortlist that fall-short in the benchmarking exercise and who 
demonstrate a clear willingness to improve performance may be eligible fo r technical assistance. 

Where groups o f s i m i l a r performing states emerge, up to six states w i l l be selected on the basis o f 
their levels o f poverty and population size, in order to maximize impact on shared growth and 
poverty reduction in the CPS period. Mov ing forward effectively w i t h partnership in lead states 
w i l l requ ire a history o f political stability and o f positive cooperation w i th development partners, 
where there has been previous engagement. 

State pa r tne rsh ip process 

The partnership w i th states w i l l be driven by: (i) bu i ld ing a long-term strategic partnership - 
aligned to a common agenda o f achieving the MDGs - as opposed to specific project financing; 
(ii) responding t o States in support o f their own strategies; (iii) providing signficant resources 
transfers, relative to a state budget, that can leverage change; (iv) working towards providing 

budget support; and (v) supporting effective collaboration among tiers of govemment. In order 

to make progress the partnership must develop and provide graduated support accordingly, and be 
co-ordinated w i t h other development partners who work at state-level. 

Aligning support behind State-owned strategies. Based SEEDS, states and the Bank/DFID w i l l 

develop in i t ia l time-bound action plans fo r strengthening systems and delivering services28. In 
addition, DFID w i l l undertake a political economy evaluation o f l ike ly blockages t o effective 
SEEDS implementation that w i l l be used to calibrate demand-side, coalition-building initiatives 
in support o f positive change. This w i l l include an assessment o f the relationship between the 
state and local governments. W B D F I D w i l l then work w i th government to develop 
implementation plans and costs, etc., identifying financing and capacity gaps. The Bank and 
DFID would align support behind these action plans and would provide technical assistance and 
policy dialogue to enable lead states to move forward effectively. 

A differentiated approach to assistance. Choice o f Bank and DFID instruments wou ld be guided 
by the quality o f policies and institutions. T o reduce transaction costs, a standard menu o f 
assistance would develop over time, i.e. off-the-shelf choices fo r States29. In order to harmonize 
support, the Bank and DFID w i l l have a division o f responsibilities w i t h respect t o the menu. 
Assistance w i l l fo l low state priorities and plans. The Bank has a number o f instruments that can 
be deployed, depending on the performance o f a State. These include, a) diagnostic and 

28 Ac t ion plans wou ld bridge the gap (if any) between the strategic pr ior i t ies o f SEEDS and details o f 
s ecific activities required to guide Bank and DFID support. 
"The menu cou ld include: i) T A support (e.g. PEM, educationihealth systems), ii) demand side activities, 
iii) SWAps, iv ) PRSCPRBS (see Figure 1). The a im wou ld be fo r States to graduate f r om TA and sector 
investment instruments to SWAps to more programmatic forms o f donor support over time. The volume o f 
assistance should also increase w i th performance to reinforce the incentives. 

Page 4 o f 5 

Annex 3 

assessment tools, and b) g rad lend ing instruments - TA , SWAPS, PRSCs etc.. DFID has a 
number o f instruments that are not currently provided b y the Bank; including promoting demand 
fo r re fo rm (w i t h the possibility o f more direct relations w i th c i v i l society and the private sector), 
flexible short-term advisory support and provision o f grants. Other donors, such as the UN, E C 
and ADB, have a id instruments that can be amenable to a s i m i l a r approach to state leve l working. 
DFID also has a network o f regional offices that can facilitate state engagement. 

Rigorous monitoring and evuhation. States’ progress against SEEDS targets and action plans 
w i l l be reviewed annually, including through repeat SEEDS Benchmarking exercises. An on- 
going po l icy dialogue w i th states w i l l be facilitated by j o i n t regional offices. I t i s anticipated that 
continued performance by a state, based on annual assessments, w i l l enable them to obtain further 
Bank support to help deliver on their priorities, as a means to strengthen incentives. F lex ib i l i ty 
would be built in to the engagement o f development partners w i th lead states, in order to manage 
potential reversals in state performance and implement an exit strategy. 

Graduation of performing States. During the end-term review o f the CPS, the Bank and DFID 
wou ld review: a) State progress against SEEDS targets and action plans, and b) effectiveness o f 
support to partner States. For those States demonstrating sufficient commitment and progress, 
consideration would be given to graduating them to more flexible instruments on the menu (e.g. 
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)/Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS); see 
Figure 1). The Bank and DFID would then prepare to deliver t h i s phase o f State support, where 
possible in close collaboration w i th other development partners. 

R i s k s 

Commitment to reform at state-level has been largely dependent on the predisposition o f the 
governor. This makes commitment to re fo rm fragile in the light o f the 2007 elections, w i t h at 
least 20 new governors. Variable commitment to re fo rm has proved a problem w i t h bo th Bank 
and DFID support to some states. Wh i le the NEEDS and SEEDS provide a new framework, 
establishing fundamental principles 
for government performance, commitment may be 
ephemeral. The mid-term review towards the end o f 2007 w i l l be c r i t ica l fo r establishing the 
credibility o f any particular state-level partnership. As part o f the in i t ia l engagement process, 
DFID w i l l carry out a po l i t ica l economy assessment to more clearly help understand such r i s k s . 

Support to lead states w i l l have f lex ib i l i ty . New commitments w i l l be on the basis o f continued 
and strengthened performance, highlighted through annual SEEDS benchmarking reviews and 
other measures. The Bank w i l l have a stronger f ie ld presence w i th more intensive management 
o f relations w i th states, jo in t ly u t i l iz ing DFID’s existing regional office infrastructure. As part o f 
addressing po l i t ica l economy constraints, work on the demand-side o f good governance w i l l 
include building transparency, accountability and citizen voice at state-level. This can also 
benefit f rom non-partisan support for greater focus on ‘issues’ in the 2007 election process f r om 
DFID and others. While the po l i t ica l economy risk at state level remains high, progress w i l l be 
made to strengthen the incentives fo r state governors to build a constituency around service 
delivery, transparency and accountability. 

The federal-state relationship can be conflictive. Mo re attention i s being g iven t o bu i ld ing 
consensus and coordination between the different tiers and the Federal Government i s designing a 
system o f incentives and rewards to challenge more states to improve their performance. The 
fiscal responsibility legislation and the SEEDS benchmarking process are key elements in 
bu i ld ing enhanced coordination. The Government i s introducing legislation to make reforms on

Conference i s a welcome development and can further contribute to change in po l i t ica l behaviors.

Nigeria’s Opportunity o f a Generation: 
Mee t ing the MDGs, Reducing Indebtedness3’ 

1. This Annex assesses the resources and actions required to achieve the MDGs in 
Nigeria, w h i l e at the same time reducing indebtedness to a manageable level. Poverty i s 
deep and pervasive in Nigeria, and w i t h about 57% o f Nigeria’s 130 m i l l i o n people l i v i n g 
in absolute pove r ty on ly China and Ind ia have more poo r people. N ige r ia must overcome 
enormous challenges in order to reach the internationally agreed M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals; the resources and actions required are daunting, but the N ige r ian 
government i s showing determination and demonstrating results. However, excellent 
performance and good luck - in the f o rm o f continued high o i l prices - w i l l n o t be 
enough to achieve the MDGS without running up unsustainable debts. International 
support - in the f o rm o f debt re l ie f and new grants - i s necessary to sustain the momen tum 
o f re fo rm and achieve the MDGs. 

A. 

Poverty, Aid and Public Debt 

2. N ige r ia the giant o f sub-Saharan Africa, but i t i s also desperately poor. I t has 

second largest economy and the most number o f people; just over a fifth o f the 
continent’s to ta l population. However, 75 m i l l i o n Nigerians l i v e o n less than $ 1 a day 
and N ige r ia has some o f the worst social indicators in the world; one in f i v e ch i ld ren d ie 
before the age o f five, there are over a m i l l i o n AIDS orphans and in the poorest parts o f 
the country one in f i f t e e n mothers die during childbirth. 

3. N e t transfers to N ige r ia have not just been small, they have been negative since 

the 1990s. In 2003, net transfers per capita amounted t o minus $1 1, w e l l be low the 
average (minus $1.3) and median (approximately $1) levels fo r L I C s exc lud ing N ige r ia . 
The difference i s even more pronounced when grants are included. In 2003, net transfers 
inc lud ing grants per capita to N ige r ia amounted to minus $9 , compared t o an average o f 
$37 and $28 f o r the median L IC . 

4. Meanwh i le , Nigeria’s external public debt - a t 50 percent o f GDP at end-2004 - 
i s we l l in excess o f the 30 percent threshold in the Bank -Fund Deb t Sustainability 

Framework (DSF) f o r low-income countries (LICs). Adding domestic debt in the f o rm o f 
treasury bills and bonds, and domestic arrears t o contractors and o n wages and pensions, 
pushes total pub l ic debt to over 80 percent o f GDP at end-2004. 

B. 

Policy Performance and Challenges 

5 . Recent performance has been commendable. The Na t iona l Econom ic 

Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) was launched in M a y 2004. This i s 
a comprehensive, entirely homegrown, economic re fo rm and pove r ty reduc t ion strategy.

I t i s underpinned b y State leve l strategies (SEEDS). I t i s strong o n analysis, ownership, 
stakeholder consultation and plans fo r mon i to r ing and implementation. 

6. Governance has imp roved . Macroeconomic s tab i l i ty has been restored. This has 
been largely due to prudent fiscal policy, the implementation o f an o i l p r ice based fiscal 
ru le and considerable savings in 2004 ($5.9bn). As a result, in f la t iona ry pressures 
subsided and in f la t ion f e l l to just under 10% at end-2004. Imp roved budget and 
procedures - inc lud ing an MTEF and procurement reforms - have been in t roduced to 
imp rove the efficiency o f expenditure. Moreover, the Obasanjo administration i s taking 
courageous and decisive action against corruption; inc lud ing some ve ry high p r o f i l e 
prosecutions. N ige r ia i s negotiating w i t h the Swiss government to have i l l i c i t l y acquired 
state funds ($500m) returned. N ige r ia i s also p rov id ing global leadership in the 
Ex t rac t ive Indus t ry Transparency In i t ia t ive (EITI). 

7. Conditions a r e also imp rov ing fo r g row th and pove r ty reduction. There has been 

a large increase in investment in infrastructure - notably power and roads. The 
restructuring and privatization o f key u t i l i t ies (power, telecommunications and ports) i s 
accelerating. N ige r ia i s committed to the ECOWAS common external tariff. 

8. T h e r e i s an oppo r tun i ty o f a generation f o r N ig e r i a to convert its “oil curse” in to 

a blessing. The Obasanjo administration i s showing determination t o imp lemen t 
economic reforms and the o i l w ind fa l l provides an opportunity f o r increasing spending on 
the MDGs. M a k i n g visible progress towards MDGs in the most populous coun t ry o f 
Sub-Saharan A f r i c a i s o f significance f o r the who le region. The resources and actions are 
daunting, and w i l l require careful balancing w i t h a goal o f reducing indebtedness. The 
key challenges facing N ige r ia are to: (i) make more e f f ic ien t use o f economic resources 
and assets, (ii) rejuvenate and sustain g row th o f the non -o i l economy, and (iii) seek 
increased international assistance in the f o rm o f debt re l ie f and new grants. 

C . 

The Baseline Scenario 

9. The baseline scenario unde r ly ing the debt sustainability analysis projects g r ow t h t o 
p i c k up to 7-8 percent in 2005-2006 and then stay at 5 percent after 2007 re f lec t ing strong 
non -o i l sector growth31. As described above, the baseline scenario i s predicated on the 
implementation o f prudent macroeconomic policies, and reforms to ensure e f f ic ien t use 
o f economic resources and rejuvenate the non -o i l economy. Other k e y assumptions are: 
(i) o i l prices peak at $46.5 per bbl in 2005, and then decline to $34 per bbl in 2015, (ii) 
real exchange rate appreciates sharply in 2005 and then maintains a sma l l depreciation 
trend, (iii) over the med ium term, fiscal p o l i c y i s consistent w i t h a n o n - o i l p r im a r y de f ic i t 
o f 40 percent o f non -o i l GDP, and ( iv ) the authorities keep external debt service 
payments at their current level, im p l y i n g an annual addition to external arrears o f $1-1.5 
b i l l i o n at a penalty interest rate. 

3 1 The Baseline scenario resu l ts were obtained using the j o i n t Bank-Fund L o w Income Coun try ( L IC ) Deb t 
Sustainability Framework (DSF) template w i th a t ime hor izon o f 2025. 

Page 2 o f 8 

Annex 4 

10. Th e Baseline scenario implies a gradual reduction in bo th to ta l pub l ic debt and 

external debt. The NPV o f external debt falls f r om 38 percent o f GDP in 2005 t o 28 
percent in 2010 and then to 8 percent b y 2025. Similarly, the NPV o f pub l ic debt falls 
f r om 5 1 percent o f GDP in 2005 to 39 percent b y 2010 and 11 percent by 2025. 

1 1. However, this finding i s highly sensitive to o i l prices, w i t h o i l accounting fo r 

80 percent o f consolidated government revenues and 90 percent o f exports. Any o i l p r ice 
decline greater than $4 per barrel -just ha l f standard deviation - w o u l d de ra i l debt 
sus ta inab i l i t y.

costs are those that need to be incurred over and above the Baseline in order t o f u l l y mee t 
the h4DGs set b y 201532. The average total cost i s $12.5bn per year; about $80 per 
person.

per year - about 2-3 percent higher than in the Baseline - wh i le o i l GDP g r ow t h i s the

w i l l erode the external debt-to-GDP ratio w i t h the passage o f time. The highlights o f the 
resu l ts are as fo l lows : 

Compared to the Baseline, the p r ima ry non -o i l de f ic i t i s higher 3-4 percentage 
points o f GDP on average as a resu l t o f the incremental outlays requ i red f o r f u l l y 
meeting the MDGs, but o i l revenues are substantially lowe r as a share o f GDP 
especially in the outer years because o f faster g row th and real appreciation. 

The debt-to-GDP ra t io fa l ls b y 13 percentage points o f GDP in 2005 as a result o f 
automatic debt dynamics. The surplus l e f t over after o i l revenues are used to 
finance the non -o i l primary de f ic i t i s added to the savings cushion (9 .9 percentage 
points) and to “top up” the savings inherited f r om the previous year. 

Pub l ic debt fa l ls below the 60 percent o f GDP threshold in 2005 i t s e l f and 
thereafter f a l l s rap id ly until 2007. In 2008, i t reverses course and returns to the 60 
percent threshold b y 201233. 

0 Cumulative fiscal savings (the cushion) rise to the target o f 20 percent o f GDP in 
2006 and stay at that leve l w i t h the help o f a small amount o f topp ing up. 

An external financing gap appears immediately as savings f a i l to accommodate 
higher p r iva te consumption and reserves are built up. On the pub l ic finances side, 
f r om 2008 onwards, the non -o i l p r ima ry de f ic i t exceeds o i l revenues. Pub l ic debt- 
to-GDP ra t io s t a r t s rising the next year to finance the de f ic i t until i t reaches the 
threshold o f 60 percent b y 2012, the f i r s t year in wh ich a s ign i f ican t f isca l gap 
appears34. 

The fiscal gap grows rap id ly until 2015. I t s net present value i s $50 b i l l i o n at a 
discount rate o f 5 percent, the rate used in the Bank -Fund DSF, far in excess o f 
Nigeria’s external pub l ic debt o f $36 b i l l i o n at end-2004.

~ 

33 The 60 percent public debt threshold i s based upon the 30 percent external public debt threshold in the 
Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries (LICs). I t i s assumed that 
Nigeria can sustain a level o f domestic public debt o f 30%. 
34 A fiscal gap would emerge much earlier i f a lower public debt to GDP threshold closer to what would be 
more acceptable in lower income countries was used for the analysis.

14. T h e projections exacerbate under the assumption o f a n o i l p r ice shock. E v e n 

under the average difference o f $6 pb, wh ich i s a l i t t l e l e s s than the one standard 
deviation o f $8 pb iden t i f ied under the Baseline, the f o l l ow i n g observations indicate a 
r a p i d deterioration in fiscal and debt outcomes compared to the high o i l p r ice scenario: 

0 W h i l e the debt-to-GDP ra t io falls rap id ly to be low 60 percent in 2005 and 2006, i t 
rises thereafter and reaches the binding indicative ce i l ing o f 60 percent by 2008. 

0 The n o n - o i l p r ima ry de f ic i t exceeds o i l revenues b y 2007. There i s n o t enough 
leeway fo r cumulative savings to reach the 20 percent o f GDP target; these leve l 
o f f at 16 percent instead. 

0 A fiscal gap appears as early as 2008, fou r years earlier than w i t h high o i l prices. 
I t grows rap id ly and has a net present value o f close to $90 b i l l ion , mo re than 
tw ice the amount o f external debt at end-2004. 

E. 

Resources and Act ions to achieve the MDGs 

15. Th e analysis shows that excellent performance and good luck - in the f o r m o f 
continued h igh o i l prices - w i l l not be enough to achieve the M D G S w i thou t runn ing 

up unsustainable debts. Further, any negative o i l p r ice shock cou ld q u i c k l y t r igge r a 
debt and macroeconomic crisis that cou ld setback reforms - as shown b y the r ise in the 
net present value o f the fiscal gap f r om $50 b i l l i o n to $90 b i l l i o n - when o i l prices f a l l 
even b y a re la t ive ly modest amount. 

0 N ige r ia should continue w i t h the break established in the 2004 Budge t between 
government spending and current o i l revenues w h i l e mon i to r ing the n o n - o i l 
p r ima ry deficit, and building up a f isca l savings cushion against o i l p r ice shocks. 
With o i l prices expected to be so high above trend f o r the nex t few years, the 

Page 5 o f 8 

Annex 4 

Government’s approach o f devoting a portion o f the o i l p r ice w i n d f a l l to the 
M D G s makes sense. 

0 The government should continue to put in place systems and measures t o ensure 
that these resources as w e l l as any additional resources made available b y the 
donor community are used well. I t has taken several steps t o bring greater 
transparency i n t o pub l ic expenditure and financial management. 

0 N ige r ia also needs to do more to rejuvenate the non -o i l economy, inc lud ing 
con t inu ing to scale up investment in roads, power, ports and water (especially in 
ru ra l areas), accelerating the privatization program (especially for utilities), 
sustaining the financial sector reforms, and implementing the E C O W A S common 
external tariff and remov ing other barriers to investment and trade. 

0 Add i t iona l external funding and donor support w i l l be needed i f N i g e r i a i s t o 
reduce bo th poverty and indebtedness. F ind ing affordable funding sources, 
inc lud ing through a higher grant financing and possible debt reduction, f o r 
f inanc ing the MDGs and related infrastructure in power, transport and water and 
sanitation, w i l l give N ige r ia a chance t o t ru ly grow out o f i t s debt p rob lem over 
the l o n g run.

represents the oppo r tun i ty o f a generat ion fo r N ige r ia to embed systemic reforms and

Page 1 o f 1 

RemarkdExplanation 

100% or high share o f Bank financing i s expected to 
be applied-selectively in i n d i v i d u a l projects on a 
case-by-case basis. Bank financing share wou ld be 
moderate in key economic infrastructure sectors e.g. 
power, roads and transport and especially in projects 
invo lv ing commercial parastatals. Projects in a l l 
other sectors could be financed up to 100% 
depending on clear assessment o f merit. 
Recurrent cost financing w i l l be used selectively in 
order not 
to compromise 
r i s k s 
to 
fiscal 
sustainability, especially at the leve l o f states. The 
Bank w i l l continue to mon i tor the fiscal and debt 
situation in states, and i t s implications for recurrent 
cost financing. 
I n l ine w i t h the proposed country 
partnership strategy (CPS), the Bank w i l l channel 
the bulk o f i t s assistance to a few core states that 
meet certain criteria including demonstrated prudent 
fiscal and budget management, inc lud ing attention 
to fiscaVdebt sustainability; and l im i t interventions 
in other states. This approach provides additional 
safeguards against any r i s k s to fiscal sustainability 
at the state leve l f r om implementation o f this new 
policy. 
In ind iv idua l projects, recurrent cos1 
financing w i l l be applied o n a careful case-by-case 
assessment o f merit tak ing in to account sector and 
pro jec t sustainability issues. 
N iger ia meets requirements fo r loca l cost financing 
The Bank can finance loca l costs in any proportions 
required b y ind iv idua l projects. 

Yes 

State sales tax fo r 
Lagos State 

The Bank may finance the costs o f taxes and duties 
associated w i t h project expenditures, other than the 
state sales tax for Lagos state, since these have been 
judged to be reasonable and non-discriminatory. A t 
the project-level, the Bank wou ld consider whether 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share 
o f project costs.

2. UNDP Response to Joint WBDF ID Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy 

The Joint WBDF ID Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) provides a common p la t fo rm fo r assistance 
to the Government o f Nigeria’s development and reform efforts because i t i s strategically linked to 
three key NEED priorities: (i) Empowering people; (ii) Promoting private enterprise; and (iii) 
Changing the way government works. In the same way UNDP’s country programme has been 
formulated to support NEEDS in four thematic areas including Governance and Human Rights, 
Poverty Reduction, Energy and the Environment, and HIV and AIDS. Thus there i s considerable 
scope for partnership that i s explored in this note. 

Ana ly t ica l wo rk in the areas o f H u m a n Development, Non -o i l G r o w t h and Governance. 

The CPS includes significant analysis in support o f the three NEEDS pillars in partnership 
w i th Nigerian institutions and other development partners (poverty assessment, Health country 
status report, Education Report, State Specific Analytical Work, Labor Market, Financial 
sector analysis, Source o f growth etc). UNDP has produced several useful analytical tools that 
can be useful in enriching these studies (Private Sector Development, Millennium Project, 
various Global and National Human Development Reports); 
Increased resource flows: The strategy i s based on an increased IDA envelope and DFID 
grant assistance. Previous portfolio reviews have identified significant capacity constraints 
especially at the state level. UNDP through i t s past and ongoing activities has gained extensive 
experience in capacity development at decentralized levels. This provides a golden 
opportunity for partnership in improving strategic planning, transparency and accountability at 
federal and state levels and better implementation o f projects and programs; 

A l ignmen t w i t h N E E D S and S E ED S and M D G s : Aimed at embedding the gains o f key 

reforms made by government, t h i s strong country-led framework i s useful fo r harmonization 
o f donor assistance to Nigeria. In addition there i s a newly invigorated focus on MDGs in 
Nigeria and the opportunity to build a global partnership fo r g row th and poverty reduction. 
UNDP has an important role as the coordinator o f the MDGs in the UN System, which 
provides a platform fo r strong collaboration in advocacy and the implementation o f projects 
and programs targeted at the achievement o f the MDGs. 
Increased aid to pe r fo rm ing states: In responding to country-led transformation at the state 
level based on a multi-donor scaling up o f aid to performing (lead) states, WB and DFID are 
laying the groundwork fo r p i lo t interventions that can be replicated. A concentration o f 
resources in performing states demands a h igh degree o f coherence fo r enhanced impact. 
UNDP i s w i l l ing to work together w i th the W B and DFID in states where i t i s present and w i l l 
extend technical support to non-performing to improve performance; 
Increased partnersh ip w i th mu lt i latera ls: UNDP f u l l y supports the CPS focus on jo in t 
working w i th multilaterals and increased coherence w i th other development partners. As the 
focus sh i f ts to fewer, bigger programs and further increase financing through multilaterals, 
UNDP w i l l seek to provide opportunities for partnership in support o f human development 
through the implementation o f i t s innovative poverty reducing interventions as we l l as 
implementing Wo r ld Bank funded projects; 

Increased focus on support to non-oil g row th b y fostering p r iva te sector development. 

Private sector development i s one o f UNDP’s core poverty alleviation strategies. Existing 
interventions for informal sector development and proposed UNDP/UNIDO partnership could 
be explored for j o i n t programming.

Capac i ty development through a series o f N E E D S Imp lemen ta t ion workshops: Topics 

include costing and implementation in a federal system; federal-state relationship for 
implementation and coordination; expenditure tracking and citizens report cards; developing 
and instituting a national M&E system; MTEF. UNDP can contribute constructively to the 
des ign and enhanced participation by CSOs in workshops; 

Strengthen ing donor coordination mechanisms: UNDP i s committed to working w i t h the 

Bank and DFlD to strengthen the existing donor coordination mechanisms and to promote a 
more strategic approach. 

Strengthen ing the mon itor ing of N E E D S and SEEDS: Support to Nigeria’s high-level 

MDG assessment and monitoring initiative and the enhancement o f Nigeria’s monitoring and 
evaluation capacity through improved data collection and reporting which i s envisaged in the 
CPS i s a fruitful area for partnership. UNDP i s already involved in capacity strengthening and 
building o f in-country monitoring and evaluation capacity. Thus the opportunity exists fo r 
greater collaboration to ensure consistency and sustainability o f MDG based monitoring. 

Table 1 outlines some opportunities for partnership including:

N iger ia: Coun t ry Partnersh ip Strategy (CPS) - Part ic ipat ion and Consu ltat ion w i t h 
Stakeholders 
December 2004 - A p r i l 2005 
(Summary) 

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) presents the jo in t Wo r ld Bank Group and DFID36 
support over the coming four years to Nigeria’s development agenda - the NEEDS and 
SEEDS37 and Nigeria’s progress towards achievement o f the M i l l e n n i um Development 
Goals (MDGs) in Nigeria. This note describes the participatory and process followed during 
the preparation o f the strategy. I t also summarizes the feedback received through the stake- 
holder consultations, which provided invaluable insights and helped strengthen the strategy. 

Partnership with Government. At the outset o f strategy discussions, a CPS Core Team was 
formed, which included members o f the Wo r ld Bank and DFID teams and government 
officials f r om the key government agencies. The Core Team worked between September 
2004 and April 2005, holding two team retreats to develop the concept o f the strategy, agree 
on principles and approaches and through regular (bi-weekly) video conferences where the 
details around expected outcomes and the program o f support were elaborated. Nigeria’s 
home-grown poverty reduction strategy - the NEEDS and SEEDS - was the starting po in t fo r 
deliberations on the strategy and a reference point through the preparation. 

Stakeholder consultcrtions. A two round consultation w i th broader Federal and State 
Government, the Legislature, c i v i l society, academia, the private sector, and media took place 
during December 2004 - April 2005. This built on earlier strategy consultations undertaken 
by DFID on i t s Country Assistance Plan f rom May - August 2004. 

I n the period December 2004-February 2005, the CPS team he ld a f i r s t round o f 
consultations. Meetings were held w i th stakeholders in Abuja and Lagos. State level 
consultations were hosted by 4 states Imo, Bauchi, Kebbi and Ogun, where stakeholders f r om 
a l l 36 neighboring states were invited. Thus, the consultation process invo lved more than 5 0 0 
people f r om more than 12 states. The participants included representatives f r om key 
m i n i s t r i e s and agencies o f the Federal Government, the National Assembly, six State 
Governors, two Deputy Governors, the Speaker o f the House o f Assembly, Commissioners, 
senior government officials, academia and more than 300 representatives o f c i v i l society 
organizations at the federal, state and local levels. Discussions were very productive, 
thoughtful and creative; contributions were made on the overall CSP content, the preparation 
process as we l l as specific areas o f focus. In addition, there was strong in te res t among 
participants in further contributing to CPS preparation, as we l l as in i t s implementation, and 
monitoring and evaluation. 

5. 

The discussions were organized around the key CPS focus areas wh ich were based on the 
NEEDS three pillars: (i) improved service delivery fo r human development; (ii) improved 
environment and services for non-oil growth; and (iii) enhanced transparency and 
accountability fo r better governance. Participants were asked t o provide overall comments on 
the proposed strategy framework, approach and to discuss particular issues, such as p r io r i ty 

36 I n N iger ia the Wo r ld Bank Group comprises the International Development Association (IDA), the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Mu l t i la tera l Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the 
W o r l d Bank Institute (WB I) . DFID i s the UK Government’s Department f o r In terna t iona l Development. 
37 NEEDS i s the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy launched in M a y 2004, and 
SEEDS i s the state equivalent. Together they comprise Nigeria’s development agenda. 

Page 1 o f 10 

Annex 8 

issues t o b e addressed, selectivity (focusing on a f ew states and thematic areas of 
intervention), and state selection approaches. Participants were also asked to discuss how t o 
build coa l i t ions and partnerships to achieve results. 

6. 

The f i r s t round o f consultations gave the CPS strong support w i t h f i v e m a i n po in ts emerging: 

con f i rma t ion and elaboration on the fundamental constraints fac ing N ige r ia , on 
mismanagement o f pub l ic resources, lack o f accoun tab i l i ty and transparency and poor 
non -o i l grow th ; 
a f f i rma t ion that the CPS team i s on the right track in selecting p r i o r i t y issues and areas 
f o r in te rven t ion based o n the NEEDS, though m ino r adjustments cou ld be made; 
focus ing o n a few states and responding to the ir ow n p lans and p r io r i t ies t o strengthen 
impac t i s appropriate. State performance and capacity should be used as c r i te r ia fo r the 
selection o f states, w i t h clear indicators, but geographical balance shou ld also be 
considered; 
ava i lab i l i ty and qua l i ty o f in fo rma t ion (federal and state levels) deserves special 
attention; and, 
strong c i v i l society engagement in the CPS preparation, imp lemen ta t ion , mon i to r ing and 
eva lua t ion i s impor tan t f o r success.

9. 

Specific feedback on imuroved service deliverv for human develoument inc luded : the human 
development agenda w i t h i t s “focus on children”, and HIV and A I D S shou ld be strengthened 
to inc lude attention to you th issues, maternal mo r ta l i ty and malaria, basic and ter t iary 
education. Poverty, education and hea l th matters can successfully be dea l t with i f addressed 
in a mu l t i-sec tora l manner (e.g. waste disposal in the case o f health). 

Specific feedback on imuroved environment and services for non-oil growth included: 
focus ing o n non -o i l g row th i s c r i t ica l f o r wea l th crea t ion and increased employment. 
Ag r icu l tu re and S M E s deserve par t icu lar attention; the ma jo r imped imen ts to non -o i l g row th 
are poor infrastructure (ma in ly roads & power) and l im i t e d access t o f inanc ia l services. 
Organized p r iva te sector cou ld demand government make changes in business environment, 
m in im iza t ion o f discretionary powers etc. 

Specific feedback o n enhanced transuarencv and accountability for better govemance 
included: good governance i s based on transparency and accoun tab i l i ty , wh ich cou ld be 
achieved through imp roved budget preparation and implementation, transparent procurement 
and c i v i l society engagement in mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f pub l ic sector performance. 
Strengthening loca l commun i t ies i s c ruc ia l fo r creating demand f o r be t ter governance and 
accoun tab i l i ty at the grassroots level. There i s also an urgen t need f o r lega l and j u d i c i a l 
re fo rm wh ich i s among the key obstacles t o N iger ia ’s development. 

10. A second round of discussions w i t h stakeholders in N ige r ia took p lace at the end of M a r c h 
2005 (and early April w i t h N iger ia ’s Econom ic Management Team) when a d ra f t document 
and feedback f r o m the f i rs t round o f consultations was circulated. The discussions con f i rmed 
strong support fo r the key pr inc ip les and approaches o f the j o i n t WB/DFID Strategy, namely, 
selectivity, targeting f o r results and a l ignmen t w i t h NEEDS /SEEDS . Par t ic ipan ts made 
valuable suggestions o n the cr i ter ia and process f o r selection o f states, result-based 
framework, the p rog ram o f interventions, po ten t ia l r i s k s , M&E arrangements and the r o l e of 
the CSO. A special top ic f o r discussion was imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy and the ro le o f

Annex 8 

d i f fe ren t stakeholders. 
Stakeholders were encouraged t o send in any fu r the r w r i t ten 
comments at the ir earliest convenience to he lp shape a f ina l dra f t o f the CPS. 

11. The f o l l o w i n g key concerns emerged at this stage o f consultations: (i) poo r coo rd ina t ion and 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity o f the Government at a l l levels creates r i s k s f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the CPS, (ii) a stronger pub l ic in fo rma t iodeduca t ion strategy around M D G N E D S B E E D S 
w o u l d h e l p develop pub l ic support and understanding o f Government’s in ten t ions and 
achievements, (iii) weak capacity o f the CSOs, absence o f coa l i t ions deprives them from 
becom ing a strong partner in the development process, f r o m p lay ing an impo r tan t advocacy 
role, ca r ry ing ou t independent assessment o f government performance and d issem ina t ing 
in fo rma t ion t o the pub l ic , ( iv ) huge debt burden remains one o f the key unreso lved issues that 
jeopardizes the ab i l i ty o f the country to move towards ach iev ing MDGs, (v) the r o l e o f med ia 
in M&E i s indispensable and should be strengthened.
