E x e c u t i v e S u m m a r y 

(i) T h e OECS’ countries a r e a t a c r i t ica l jun c tu r e in th e i r deve lopment . Just three decades after 

ga in ing independence, they are struggling to find new sources o f g row th and reduce vulnerability, against a 
backdrop o f an increasingly competitive g loba l environment; the loom ing end o f trade preferences; and 
dw ind l ing o r log- jammed donor resources. These challenges are further compounded by the ir fiscal 
imbalances and high debt ratios and their inherent vu lnerab i l i ty as sma l l is land developing states* (S IDS ) . 
Since the last CAS period, economic indicators have deteriorated and a l l s ix OECS countries are in the top 
fifteen o f the wor ld ’s most indebted (relative to GDP) emerging market countries. The impressive social 
development gains made over the past 30 years now risk being eroded by the current challenging f isca l and 
debt situations and by the economic transformation that may be required to adapt to the changing external 
environment. S i g n s o f the erosion are already emerging in the shape o f rising pover ty in b o t h ru ra l and urban 
areas, disenfranchised you th and high unemployment, and a corresponding increase in crime. The countries 
also face the risk posed by the g row ing HIViAIDS epidemic in the Caribbean. 
(ii) Furthermore, as sma l l states, they face a vu lnerab i l i ty to external shocks, inc lud ing na tura l disasters; 
limited economic d ivers i f ica t ion opportunities and high dependence o n external trade; h i g h cost o f pub l ic 
service p rov is ion due to diseconomies o f scale; and l im i ted capacity in the pub l ic and pr iva te sectors. In a 
few areas, these diseconomies o f scale and capacity constraints have been successfully overcome through 
reg iona l in i t ia t ives and projects. Go ing forward, leveraging reg iona l approaches more aggressively w i l l be 
c r i t ica l to the sub-region’s efforts to rev ive g row th and imp rove competitiveness and reduce vulnerabilities. 
However, a coordinated reg iona l approach by the OECS governments i s o f ten thwarted by differences in their 
electoral cycles and b y traditions o f national sovereignty. 

T h e W o r l d Bank G r o u p S t r a t e g y f o r FY06-09 

(iii) The W o r l d Bank Group’s Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r the Organization o f Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) proposes a new way o f do ing business to he lp these sma l l states meet the challenges 
facing them at th is c r i t ica l stage o f their development. 
I t s guiding pr inc ip les are: (a) supporting reg iona l 
in tegra t ion and coord ina t ion efforts; (b) partnering and harmon iza t ion in b o t h lend ing and ana ly t ica l wo rk 
w i t h other development partners; and (c) active pursu i t o f s imp l i f ica t ion and capacity building in i t ia t ives 
ta i lored to sma l l states. 
(iv) 
The W o r l d Bank Group’s strategy fo r the four years covered by th is CAS (FY06-09) supports the 
sub-region’s development agenda through two ma in p i l la rs : (1) s t imu la t ing g row th and imp rov ing 
competitiveness; and (2) reduc ing vulnerability, by p romo t ing greater social inc lus ion and strengthening 
disaster risk management. 
Recogn iz ing the OECS countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank ac t iv i t ies 
(v) 
w i l l focus, where possible, o n using innova t ive mechanisms to leverage available donor grant f inanc ing across 
the sub-region. Under P i l la r 1, IBRD and IDA support wou ld focus o n s t imu la t ing g row th and 
competitiveness by p rov id ing technical and f inanc ia l assistance fo r pub l ic sector modern iza t ion and 
competitiveness, pub l ic u t i l i t y reform, and s k i l l s enhancement. Ana ly t ica l and advisory ac t iv i t ies to support 
P i l la r 1 wou ld inc lude po l icy notes o n pub l ic sector and pub l ic utility reforms, s k i l l s enhancement, investment 
c l ima te assessments and an OECS f iduc ia ry assessment. Under P i l la r 2, designed to he lp reduce 
vulnerability, the Bank wou ld promote catastrophe risk insurance and environmental management as w e l l as 
continue the dialogue on disaster r i s k m i t iga t ion in i t ia t ives . I t wou ld also support the OECS Governments in 
strengthening social pro tec t ion mechanisms, in par t icu lar addressing vulnerable groups such as you th at risk. 
F ina l ly , the Bank w i l l continue to support c l ima te adaptation measures and efforts at restoring the ab i l i ty o f 

’ For the purposes o f this CAS, the OECS i s defined to include Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, S t . 
Luc ia and S t . Vincent and the Grenadines, a l l members o f the Wo r ld Bank Group. There i s a seventh, full member (Montserrat) and 
two associate members (Angu i l la and the Br i t ish V i rg in Islands) wh ich are overseas territories o f the Un i ted Kingdom. T h i s strategy 
supports both national and sub-regional interventions in the six OECS countries across a total landmass no larger than 2,364 sq. km, 
w i th a total population o f jus t over h a l f a m i l l i o n (a fifth o f the size o f Jamaica, and a quarter o f i t s population). 

T h e Wor ld Bank framework of assistance for small states indicates seven areas o f ac t iv i ty related to the four categories-tackling 
volatility, vulnerability, and natural disasters; strengthening capacity; meeting challenges and opportunities o f globalization; and 
adapting to the changing global trade regime.

na tura l ecosystems to withstand climate va r iab i l i ty effects. Under P i l la r 1 and 2, the sub-region w i l l benefit 
f r om Caribbean-wide analytical wo rk o n social pro tec t ion and pension reform; crime, violence and social 
exclusion; f inanc ia l sector and regulation; health financing; and a i r transport rationalization. Through i ts 
ex is t ing po r t fo l io , the Bank w i l l continue to support bo th P i l lars 1 and 2 through interventions in the areas o f 
disaster risk management, HIV/AIDS, telecommunications l ibera l iza t ion and education sector re form . 
F ina l ly , ongo ing technical support and additional technical assistance fo r improved pover ty and social 
ind ica tor measurement and mon i to r ing and pub l ic finance management i s also envisaged. 
(vi) 
IFC ’s strategy w i l l be to support projects wh ich w i l l enhance the competitiveness o f the OECS 
economies he lp ing them meet the challenges o f globalization, especially trade liberalization, focusing o n 
env ironmen ta l ly sustainable business practices and imp rov ing standards o f corporate governance. I F C w i l l 
seek to finance and partner w i t h those companies able to diversify the region’s sources o f growth, further 
reg iona l economic in tegra t ion ( inc lud ing w i t h the bigger is land economies such as Barbados, T r in idad and 
Tobago, and Jamaica), and develop linkages w i t h the smaller loca l ly based island businesses. Some o f the 
sectors o f focus en ta i l the f inanc ia l sector, infrastructure, services (IT, tourism), and the social sectors. Given 
the par t icu lar issues and constraints faced by is land economies (cr i t ica l mass, collateral), I F C very o f ten 
cannot finance stand alone projects. The ava i lab i l i ty o f grant f inanc ing by no tab ly European donors provides 
an oppor tun i ty to develop some funding mechanism through wh ich donor monies cou ld be used to 
share/lower the commercial risk, and thereby facilitate I FC ’s financing. S truc tur ing e f fec t ive r i s k sharing 
structures w i l l be key to IFC ‘s ab i l i ty to support pr iva te sector development in the OECS countries. F C and 
the Bank w i l l coordinate the ir efforts towards developing e f fec t ive partnerships w i t h the donor commun i ty . 
(vii) MIGA’s invo lvemen t in the OECS reg ion has p r ima r i ly been through technical assistance in FDI 
attraction and the agency i s scheduled to undertake a benchmarking exercise in F Y 0 6 wh ich w i l l focus o n the 
investors’ perspective and w i l l g ive the par t ic ipa t ing countries a comparative v iew o f their competitiveness 
v is-&v is FDI. MIGA w i l l continue to rev iew requests at the reg iona l o r coun try levels as they arise. 

Managing R i s k s 

(viii) The C A S has three scenarios w i t h d i f feren t lend ing volumes and number o f operations. The base case 
(IDA on ly) lending scenario includes operations for a to ta l o f U S $ 51.3 m i l l i o n over 4 years in the l B R D / I D A 
blend countries3. The high case lending scenario consists o f US$52 .1 m i l l i o n in lBRD on ly commitments 
add i t iona l to the base case, bringing the to ta l lend ing envelope to US$103.4 m i l l ion . In the l o w case (IDA 
on ly) scenario, the Bank wou ld support operations fo r a to ta l o f U S $ 3 1.2 m i l l i o n in the IDA blend countries4. 
K e y r i s k s are (i) the lack o f sustained OECS Governments’ commitment t o restore f isca l and debt 
sustainability; (ii) natural disasters and other exogenous shocks (i.e. o i l p r ice and interest rate increases) wh ich 
cou ld further exacerbate these countries’ vu lnerab i l i ty ; (iii) l im i ted Governments’ commitment to advance 
force fu l ly o n reg iona l coord ina t ion and integration; and (iv) weak project imp lemen ta t ion capacity. 
( ix) 
The CAS program seeks to manage r i s k s through care fu l selection o f triggers and mon i to r ing o f 
progress, continued support fo r disaster risk preven t ion and m i t iga t ion , and a focus o n capac i ty-bu i ld ing at 
b o t h the na t iona l and reg iona l levels. M o r e emphasis than was g iven in the past w i l l be comm i t ted to 
ensuring that Bank-supported interventions are designed to benefit f r om broad consultative processes 
invo lv ing c i v i l society and the pr iva te sector. In addition, t h e Bank w i l l continue t o pursue outreach efforts to 
c i v i l society to encourage an understanding o f the development challenges fac ing the sub-region and to build 
consensus around needed reforms. 

By virtue o f the small states exception, Dominica, Grenada, St. L u c i a and St. Vincent and the Grenadines are IBRD / IDA blend 
countries even though their incomes are well above the I D A cutoff. For them, the IDN I BRD lending ratio has traditionally been set at 
5 0 5 0 . St. Kitts and Nevis has graduated to IBRD-only status since i t s per capita income i s above US$6,000. Antigua and Barbuda, 
with a per capita income o f over US$9,000, has never borrowed from the Bank Group, but has expressed an interest in doing so. 

T h i s includes US$ 15.2 mn from the Regional I D A allocation.

T H E ORGAN IZAT ION OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN STATES 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

I. Overview 

1. 

The s ix members o f the OECS are s im i lar in size, climate, topography and h is tory . They also face a 
number o f common challenges. First, they are a l l seeking new sources o f g row th and a way to reduce 
vulnerability, against a backdrop o f an increasingly competitive g loba l environment; the loom ing end o f trade 
preferences; and dwindling o r log-jammed donor resources. Second, they a l l face f isca l imbalances and h i g h 
debt ratios, compounded by the ir inherent vu lnerab i l i ty as sma l l is land developing states. F ina l ly , the 
impressive social development gains made over the past 30 years now risk being eroded by the current 
challenging f isca l and debt situations and by the economic trans forma t ion that may be requ ired to adapt to the 
changing external environment. 
2. 
Despite the ir similarities, the OECS countries rema in d is t inc t in many ways. In tourism--a f ierce ly 
competitive sector, wh ich accounts for almost 75 percent o f the ir co l lec t ive GDP - -wh i le they share a common 
“Eastern Caribbean destination”, they also exp lo i t their d is t inc t features5. And in the agriculture sector-- 
h is tor ica l ly important, bu t whose produc t ion has been halved as a share o f GDP over the last twen ty years--St. 
K i t t s and Nev is has g rown sugar6; three others (Dominica, St. L u c i a and St. V incen t and the Grenadines) grow 
bananas, wh i le Grenada, until the recent events o f Hurr icane Ivan, had marketed i tse l f successfully as the 
“spice island”, second on ly to Indonesia in g loba l nutmeg production. 
These mu l t i- face ted challenges require the W o r l d Bank Group to design i t s assistance strategy in a 
way that reflects b o t h the na t iona l and the sub-regional development needs o f these countries. This document 
i s organized as fo l lows : The f irs t section presents an overv iew o f the sub-region’s po l i t ica l , economic and 
social context, and discusses some key development challenges. ‘The second section presents the OECS 
Development Charter and progress to date o n i t s implementation, inc lud ing moves towards greater reg iona l 
integration, The third section reviews the lessons learned f r om prev ious Bank invo lvemen t in the OECS and 
presents a strategy fo r the nex t four years. The four th section h igh l igh ts how the Bank wou ld manage r i s k s 
under the CAS .

11. The Country Context 

The Political Context 

4. 
Characterized by po l i t ica l stability, the OECS countries boast open democracies, with strong (over 80 
percent) par t ic ipa t ion in elections. They have retained Westminster-style Parliamentary government systems 
wh ich have no t evolved or been modernized since their establishment, lead ing to c i v i l services wh ich are 
large, bureaucratic and burdensome to the ir sma l l economies. A l l bu t one o f the OECS Pr ime M in is ters h a i l 
f rom strong labour par ty roots. O f the s ix Heads o f Governments, one has recen t ly been elected (An t igua and 
Barbuda), three have recen t ly been returned to o f f ice (Grenada in 2003, St. K i t t s and N e v i s in 2004, and 
Dom in ica in 2005) and tw o (S t . Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines) w i l l seek re-election in the next 
eighteen months. In M a r c h o f 2004, fo l low ing 40 years o f the Bird dynasty, and i ts associated ruinous fiscal 
management and poor transparency7, B a l dw i n Spencer was elected as An t igua and Barbuda’s Pr ime M in is te r 
w i t h a resounding ma jo r i ty . St. K i t t s and Nev is recently returned t h e Pr ime M in is te r , Denz i l Douglas, t o 
power and in Grenada, Pr ime M in is te r K e i t h M i tche l l - - the lone centrist--returned to o f f ice fo r a second term 
w i t h a reduced one-seat ma jo r i ty in Parliament. In Dom in ica , Roosevelt Skerrit was returned to office, adding 
two seats (g iv ing him 12 out o f 20) to h i s Labou r Party’s ma jo r i ty E lec t ions must be ca l led in bo th St. V incen t 
and the Grenadines and S t . L u c i a by 2007. A l l o f the P r ime Ministers, w i t h the exception o f An t igua and 
Barbuda and Grenada, are also the Finance M i n i s t e r s . 

I n the tour ism sector, fo r example, the islands o f St. V incen t and the Grenadines and D om i n i c a do n o t have runways that can 
accommodate large jets, bu t they boast yach t ing and eco-tourism respec t ive ly as the i r o w n n iche markets. S im i lar ly , some islands 
cater to predom inan t ly British marke ts (Grenada), others to the US (St. Kitts and Nev is ) w h i l e others cater t o bo th (St. Luc ia) . 
’ During the 1 9 8 O s , a series o f large p u b l i c investments, surrounded by governance issues, t um e d ou t to be unproduc t ive . A l lega t ions 
St. Kitts and Nev is has recen t ly announced i t s last sugar crop w i l l b e harvested in July 2005. 
o f money launder ing and proven misuse o f the med ica l insurance scheme have also con tr ibu ted to the country’s debt: GDP estimated 
at 142 percent in 2003.

5 . 

The P r ime M in is ters are committed to the Caribbean Commun i ty and Common Ma rke t (CAR ICOM ) 
and the move towards a broader single market and economy under the Caribbean Single Ma rke t and Economy 
(CSME)*. F o l l ow i n g a protracted per iod o f weak leadership at the OECS Secretariat’, the new D i rec to r - 
General has sought t o rev i ta l ize i t s mission and has support f r om the OECS Heads fo r mov ing fo rwa rd w i t h 
reg iona l in i t ia t ives , Funding fo r the secretariat has, however, been sporadic and the OECS authority has no t 
managed to ma tch i t s po l i t ica l commitment w i t h much-needed f inanc ia l support. The Secretariat i s mandated 
to imp lemen t t h e sub-region’s Development Charter wh i le the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) has 
taken the lead o n in i t ia t ives supporting an OECS economic un ion . 
6. 
Ove r t h e past year, the Governments’ commitment to con fron t ing their economic problems has 
strengthened. They now openly recognize that the current economic situation i s unsustainable and have 
started t o take steps to address the challenges facing them. Spurred by the f isca l crisis in Dom in ica , the 
adm in is tra t ion change in An t igua and Barbuda and the devastation caused by Hurr icane I v a n in Grenada, and 
against a backdrop o f diminishing agricultural trade preferences and an increasingly compe t i t ive g loba l 
environment, the OECS Pr ime M i n i s t e r s are interested in exp lor ing new options to revive g row th and deal 
w i t h the ir debt situations. However, many o f them have yet to build the requ ired consensus to implement 
b o l d adjustment programs and to date on ly limited pub l ic consultations have taken place. The OECS 
populace expects high living standards because o f the “demonstration effect” exerted by their strong ties to 
N o r t h Ame r ica through tour ism and m igra t ion . Mee t ing those expectations entails s ign i f ican t pressure o n 
incumbent governments, and opposition parties are qu ick t o seize o n any po ten t ia l signals that d i f f icu l t 
adjustment may be needed. The situation i s further exacerbated by the differences in electoral cycles wh ich 
makes co l lec t ive reg iona l pos i t ion ing challenging. Creating ownership fo r change w i l l , therefore, require 
s ign i f ican t outreach efforts to c i v i l society to i n f o rm them and consult o n existing challenges and options fo r 
addressing them.

Social indicators fo r the OECS countries a re strong and almost a l l o f the ma jo r M i l l e n n i um 
Development Goals have been met. Pr imary education net enrollment ratios, fo r example, are high, between 
84 and 100, and in fan t mo r ta l i ty rates are low , ranging f r om 14 to 22 per 1,000, Drama t ic progress in access 
to improved water source and sanitation has also taken place over the last ten years’O. L i f e expectancy, ranges 
from 71 t o 77 years, comparable to most OECD countries. 
However, despite t h e achievements attained over the past three decades, these social gains risk being 
eroded by fou r key factors. F irs t , the current challenging f isca l and debt situation has made current levels o f 
spending in c r i t ica l sectors such as education and hea l th no longer affordable and po in ts to the need fo r urgent 
reforms t o imp rove e f f ic iency and cost effectiveness. Second, weak educational attainment and a limited 
cu r r icu lum are hav ing a s t i f l ing effect o n g row th and competitiveness and con tr ibu t ing to rising 
unemployment among youth. Third, l o w popu la t ion g row th rates o f less than 0.3 percent and an increasingly 
older popu la t ion (wh ich lead to an increasing e lder ly dependency rate) w i l l require a reor ien ta t ion o f bo th the 
hea l th and education sectors to reflect this demographic shift. F ina l ly , the h i g h and g row ing prevalence o f the 
H N / A I D S epidemic in the Caribbean, i f no t addressed, wou ld reverse gains in the hea l th indicators and have 
grave consequences for ove ra l l g row th and development in the OECS countries.

H e a l th . Hea l th M in is t r ies across the sub-region are grapp l ing w i t h a number o f common issues - - 
re f lec t ive o f the ir sma l l size, dispersed populations and changing demographics--and are seeking ways t o 
de l iver hea l th services more e f f ic ien t ly . The OECS countries are s trugg l ing to address issues in two key 
areas: (1) the wage bill, wh ich accounts for between 60 and 80 percent o f hea l th expenditures, resu l t ing in 
insu f f ic ien t investment in infrastructure and equipment, and (2)the i s s u e o f s k i l l s deficiencies due to the 
m ig ra t ion o f nurses wh ich has resulted in poor facilities and weak p rov is ion o f specialist services: 
The benefits o f reg iona l approaches to common challenges are perhaps nowhere better i l lus tra ted than 
in the hea l th sector. The establishment o f the OECS Pharmaceutical Procurement Service, as a sub-agency o f 
the OECS Secretariat, lowered the cost o f pharmaceuticals across the sub-region by around 40 percent. There 
i s scope to expand th is type o f “collective approach” w i t h i n the sector in areas such as purchasing supplies, 
laboratory services and specialized hea l th service de l ivery through reg iona l arrangements, and in to other 
sectors, such as the procurement o f textbooks. Another pressing reason fo r extensive reforms w i t h i n the 
OECS hea l th sectors i s the demographic and epidemiological transition. The reduc t ion in mo r ta l i ty due to 
communicable diseases, the r ise in l i f e expectancy and the f a l l in fe r t i l i ty rates w i l l have drastic imp l ica t ions 
fo r the p rov is ion o f health care over the next d e ~ a d e ’ ~ . Non-commun icab le diseases and chronic conditions 
such as hypertension, diabetes, strokes and coronary heart disease w i l l be the hea l th challenges o f an aging 
popu la t ion and hea l th sectors w i l l need to make adjustments in their strategies to re f lec t these changes. 
16. 
HIV/AIDS. The W o r l d Hea l th Organization estimates the ove ra l l H I V / A I D S prevalence in the 
Caribbean to be second to Sub-Saharan A f r ica . In the OECS, t h e prevalence i s estimated to be approaching 1 
percent o f the OECS popu la t ion compared to 7.5 percent average fo r Sub-Saharan A f r ica . In sma l l islands 
l i k e those o f the OECS, such an HIV prevalence rate can rap id ly affect the country’s development prospects. 
Furthermore, uncon tro l led spread o f the disease in a s ing le country threatens the success to con tro l the 
epidemic in the w ider Caribbean reg ion because o f the populations’ high mob i l i ty among islands. This i s 
par t icu lar ly the case in the OECS, where, notwithstanding pub l ic in fo rma t ion efforts, the epidemic continues 
to spread f r om high-risk groups to the general population. Furthermore, detection and treatment are stymied 
by under-reporting, an ongo ing stigma attached to those in fec ted w i t h H I V / A I D S and continued r i s k y 
behavior among vulnerable groups such as youth. 
17. 
The leaders o f the OECS sub-region have iden t i f ied the f igh t against H I V / A I D S as c r i t ica l to the sub- 
region’s long- term economic g row th and human development. Fo r i t s part, the donor community, inc lud ing 
the Bank-through 
four projects under the Mu l t i -Coun t ry H I V / A I D S Adaptable Program Lending (APL) in 
Grenada, S t . K i t t s and Nevis, St. Luc ia and S t . V incen t and the Grenadines-has 
ra l l ied to support the OECS 
islands in the ir efforts to curb the spread o f the H I V / A I D S epidemic through increasing awareness o f r isks , 
p romo t ing behavioral change, strengthening treatment and care; and, development o f a sustainable 
organizational and ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r addressing the epidemic over the longer te rm . The complex, 
mu l t i-d imens iona l nature o f H IV /ATDS strategies w i l l demand strengthened ins t i tu t iona l capacity and a 
framework that a l lows cooperation across sectors. E f fec t ive approaches to the HIVIAIDS challenge in the 
Caribbean w i l l also require better coord ina t ion among the various donors and other agencies so that the reg ion 
can benefit f r om an overa l l strategic approach to the epidemic. G iven the debt s i tua t ion fac ing the OECS, 
grant resources should be leveraged where possible. 
Social P ro tec t ion . The OECS countries face a number o f impor tan t socio-economic r i s k s . The high 
levels o f income and consump t ion vo la t i l i ty , due to an array o f ex tema l economic shocks, na tura l disasters 
and domestic po l icy- induced shocks, have translated in to equa l ly high levels o f vu lnerab i l i ty among 
individuals, households and communities. These manifest themselves as chron ic and transient poverty, weak 
human capital development, j o b o r income loss, persistent unemployment, and income insecurity in o l d age. 
Poor families and you th find themselves par t icu lar ly vulnerable, and w i t h re la t ive ly few risk management 
tools at their disposal. 
A l l the OECS countries imp lemen t a range o f programs - b o t h social insurance and social assistance 
- t o m i t iga te these r i s k s , but a number o f structural challenges hamper the ir impact, inc lud ing : (i) overlapping 
and uncoordinated programs; (ii) weak targeting; (iii) inadequate or nonex is ten t M I S systems; and (iv) weak 
implementation capacity. Soc ia l insurance (Le., social security) programs that p rov ide hea l th insurance and 
old-age security, among other things, also con fron t important structural challenges. A vast ma jo r i ty o f the

poo r and in fo rma l sector workers remain uncovered; moreover, i f unreformed, some o f these programs face 
inso lvency in the long - run due to the rap id aging o f loca l populations. A Social Protection Strategy Paper for 
t h e Caribbean i s lay ing the ground wo rk fo r a more strategic approach to social pro tec t ion re fo rm in the 
OECS that includes improved coordination among donors as w e l l as exp lo i ta t ion o f cross-country synergies. 
Increas ing ly ou t o f school and out o f work, you th at risk are also emerging as a significant challenge and 
Governments have expressed the urgent need for interventions that are remedial as w e l l as preventive. An 
increase in, among other things, HIV/AIDS incidence; teenage pregnancies; high school drop out rates; and 
antisocial behaviors o f ten resu l t ing in cr ime have been d irec t ly l inked to this segment o f the population. 
Education. A l though a l l the countries achieved universal p r ima ry enrollment and comp le t ion in 
2000 (the la t ter w i t h the exception o f St. V incen t and the Grenadines, wh ich i s expected to attain this w i t h i n 
the next year), and rap id increases in secondary school enrollment rates are underway (see Table 2), 
comp le t ion rates are lagging, and the qua l i ty o f education remains a ma jor issue. The OECS education sectors 
are ~ e l l - f u n d e d ' ~ bu t poo r ly managed and the outputs do no t re f lec t the considerable pub l ic resources 
dedicated to them. I f the OECS countries f a i l to change some o f the fundamentals (curr icu lum content, 
teacher t ra in ing and equitable access), the gains made in the p r ima ry sector over the last decade w i l l become

Poor education outcomes in the context o f high pub l ic spending ind ica te serious ine f f ic ienc ies in the 
education systems. L o w pupil: teacher ratios, ine f f ic ien t teacher deployment and scant pre-service tra in ing I5 
have combined to raise the personnel costs wh i le constraining the number o f trained teachers in classrooms 
across the region. One outcome o f the l o w qua l i ty and inequitable access t o secondary education in the OECS

are perceived as irrelevant o f ten being taught by unqua l i f ied teachers, and schools wh ich condone corporal 
punishment--are a k e y con tr ibu t ing factors to a r i s e in r isky you th behavior and social exclusion, par t icu lar ly 
among boys. 
The OECS also has a serious shor t fa l l in post-secondary attainment, due in great par t to the poor 
22. 
qua l i ty o f secondary education and an inadequate prov is ion o f ter t iary education. However, as the fo l low ing 
section indicates, a significant share o f ter t iary graduates m igra te abroad w i t h a resulting loss to the pub l ic o f 
r e t u r n s f rom th is pub l ic investment. 
Increasing non-governmental f inanc ing in tertiary education wh i le 
ensuring access to low- income students through scholarships and student loans are hndamen ta l changes 
needed to increase enrollment and equity in the hture.

countries in the w o r l d w i t h t h e highest m ig ra t ion rates”. Four o f the countries also rank among those w i t h the 
highest remittances per capita.” These m ig ra t ion and remittance f lows are s ign i f ican t and p lay an important 
role, g iven the sma l l popu la t ion size and the inherent susceptibility o f sma l l states. There are three broad 
categories o f m igran ts - those who m igra te w i t h i n the OECS, those who m igra te w i t h i n the Caribbean reg ion 
and those who m igra te to O ECD countries - ma in ly the US , Canada and the UK. Extra-regionally, i t has been 
estimated that the OECS commun i ty abroad numbers 200,000 people or about 35 percent o f the population. 
F r om the data available, the ma jo r i ty o f those m igra t ing are sk i l led and post-secondary educated workers, 
many o f whom are jo ined later by their families (more than one- th ird o f the residencies granted in the U S are,

(1) a social d is loca t ion among fam i l ies and 
This departure o f educated migrants has two impacts: 
communities and (2) a reduc t ion in p roduc t iv i ty in specific sectors o f the economy creating labor gaps, 
par t icu lar ly in the pub l ic sector --where capacity i s weak--and the entrepreneurial class. OECS Governments 
are increasingly encouraging return m ig ra t ion as an important source o f s k i l l s , expertise and ideas (Le. b ra in 
gain, c ircu la t ion o r exchange) to be drawn on for national and reg iona l development. 
24. 
In the OECS, remittances have made a healthy con tr ibu t ion to GDP, f r om almost 11 percent in 
Grenada to 3 percent in An t igua and Barbuda, w i t h an average o f around 5 percent across the region, O n the 
pos i t ive side, they represent an impor tan t element o f the safety net fo r the poor and ~ n e m p l o y e d . ’ ~ O n the

wage in the economy to the detriment o f competitiveness. M o r e impor tan t ly , i t i s unclear whether remittances 
can compensate in the long- term fo r the pub l ic investment foregone by governments. A key challenge w i l l be

The OECS countries experienced a re la t ive ly strong decade o f rea l GDP g row th in the 1980s (5.9

percent per year). 
In i t ia l ly , th is decline was large ly caused by a sharp reduc t ion in p roduc t iv i ty g row th 
associated w i t h s h i f t s in the composition o f investment, weakening performance in the export sector, 
compe t i t ive pressures f r om lower-pr iced tourist destinations and a g row ing inwa rd orientation o f the pr iva te 
sector. This trend was exacerbated in the early 2000s by many negative external shocks (natural disasters, the 
9 /11 events, the s lowdown in the g loba l economy, o i l pr ice increases and eroding trade preferences). The 
OECS Governments tr ied to offset the s lowdown and sustain employment as w e l l as meet natural disaster- 
related costs through an expansionary fiscal po l icy , ma in ly through increased pub l ic investments financed by 
expensive commerc ia l bo r row ing (both external and domestic). This created persistent f isca l deficits and 
boosted pub l ic sector debt to some o f the highest levels in the wo r ld . In fou r countries (An t igua and Barbuda, 
Dom in ica , Grenada and St. K i t t s and Nevis) ex is t ing debt l e v e l s are at or in excess o f 100 percent o f GDP. 
The large f isca l and debt imbalances are now further dampening g row th and pr iva te investment. The lack o f 
an enforceable f isca l discipline mechanism in the currency board arrangement and the easy access to external 
credit f rom commerc ia l banks outside the sub-region contributed to weakened f isca l discipline. In effect, the

Macroeconomic performance in the OECS countries imp roved in 2003 and 2004. D r i v e n by a rap id 
expansion in tou r ism in most countries fo l low ing the 9 /11 slowdown, rea l GDP g row th was 3.4 and 3.2 
percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively, despite an active hurricane season in the second h a l f o f 2004. The 
aggregate OECS f isca l balance imp roved f r om -10.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to an estimated -5.6 and -4.9 
percent in 2003 and 2004*O, o n account o f strengthened revenue administration, enhanced expenditure controls 
and some reduc t ion in capital spending. The imp roved f isca l performance and renewed g row th have no t been 
sufficient, however, to steer pub l ic debt to GDP ratios o n a downward pa th (w i t h an OECS average o f 106 
percent o f GDP at end - 2004). 
D r i v e n by the continued g row th in the U S and UK (the sub-region’s m a i n tour ism markets), rea l GDP

g row th i s projected at 3.2 percent in 2005. W h i l e key actions are underway in several OECS h igh ly indebted 
countries to address the f isca l imbalances, the pace o f f isca l conso l ida t ion should be accelerated to place debt 
on a c lear ly downward path, no tab ly by broadening the tax base, inc lud ing through the in t roduc t ion o f a 
broad-based consumption tax (or VAT), streamlining expenditures and strengthening f isca l institutions. Also,

I t i s unlikely that in the highly indebted countries debt can be brough t down purely 
through f isca l adjustment, so a mu l t i-pronged approach, incorpora t ing sustained f isca l adjustment, growth- 
enhancing structural reforms, improved debt management, and possible debt restructuring i s needed.

In Dom in ica , the Government i s already imp lemen t ing such a strategy w i t h the coordinated f inanc ia l 
and technical support f rom the IMF under a PRGF-supported program, the W o r l d Bank and other donors. 
Progress in f isca l consolidation i s expected to continue in those countries that he ld elections in 2004. An t igua 
and Barbuda has announced an ambitious f isca l re fo rm agenda inc lud ing the re in troduc t ion o f a personal

reconstruction and macroeconomic stabilization measures; and St. K i t t s and Nev is has announced the closure

percent o f GDP (Dominica, Grenada, and An t igua and Barbuda) have adopted a more fo rce fu l debt strategy in 
an attempt to bring down their high debt levels and are curren t ly pursuing debt restructuring agreements w i t h 
creditors. The exception i s St. K i t t s and Nev is where the authorities anticipate proceeds over the nex t few 
years f r om the d ispos i t ion o f assets ( inc lud ing land) o f the sugar state-owned company.

Prospects fo r fiscal consolidation in St. V incen t and the Grenadines and S t . Luc ia (the two countries 
w i t h lowe r pub l ic debts) w i l l be in f luenced by electoral cycles (w i t h bo th countries expected to h o l d elections 
no later than 2006); in these countries, the approved budgets suggest easing o f f isca l stances, inc lud ing a 
s ign i f ican t expansion in pub l ic sector investment and w i t h the authorities targeting reduc t ion in the debt levels 
on ly over the medium-term. W h i l e this approach has r i s k s in v iew o f the high vu lne rab i l i ty o f these

Growth and Competitiveness. A secular s lowdown in growth, a rad ica l transformation o f the 
ex tema l environment and debt and fiscal imbalances have combined to create an impera t ive fo r strengthening 
the OECS strategy fo r grow th and competitiveness. A Bank repor t recently completed at the request o f the 
OECS countries2’ presents an overarching strategic framework fo r g row th and competitiveness that cou ld 
serve to guide the various efforts o f the na t iona l and reg iona l authorities, the pr iva te sector and development 
partners to d e f i n e and implement a strategy t o stimulate g row th and improve competitiveness. The report

This strategy wou ld need to inc lude a number o f growth-enhancing interventions: (i) streamlining and 
refocusing the ro le o f government through accelerated f isca l adjustment and pub l ic sector modernization; (ii) 
expansion o f the s k i l l s base and p romo t ion o f innova t ion and technology adoption; (iii) a reduc t ion in the key 
constraints to do ing business; (iv) the reduction o f inwa rd orientation and expansion o f external market 
space;22 and (v) rap id implementation o f free movement o f labor w i t h i n the OECS and C SM E and use o f 
in terna t iona l standards and certifications. Such interventions wou ld support the development o f emerging 
possible new sources o f g row th such as offshore education, health and we l lness tou r ism and high-end IC T . In 
order to b r ing such an agenda to fru i t ion , a concerted e f for t on the part o f the OECS governments, the sub- 
reg iona l institutions, the pr iva te sector and c i v i l society w i l l be required, as we l l as sustained support f r om 
the ir development partners, over a medium term horizon. Given the l im i ted capacity o f the OECS pub l ic 
sectors to address these mu l t ip le challenges, the report proposes a number o f p r io r i ty actions that can be 
addressed over the short- to medium-term: 
Restoring f isca l and debt sustainability and imp rov ing the e f f ic iency o f pub l ic administration. In 
add i t ion to improved debt management, efforts are needed to: refocus and imp rove the strategic 
p lann ing o f pub l ic investment programs and improve pub l ic procurement; re fo rm pub l ic sector wage 
mechanisms to a l ign wage increases w i t h p roduc t iv i ty improvements; re fo rm the tax regime, 
inc lud ing r o l l i n g out the VAT, remov ing non - ta r i f f barriers to trade and reduc ing the u s e o f 
investment incentives and discretionary tax concessions, to leve l the p lay ing field fo r businesses; and 
refocus the ro le o f the pub l ic sector in the management o f the economy, in par t icu lar by reduc ing 
unnecessary layers o f approvals and discretion in the adm in is tra t ion o f regulations, pe rm i ts and 
license administration; 
ra is ing the s k i l l s base by: re fo rm ing teacher tra in ing and deployment schemes; accelerating 
curr icu lum re fo rm in schools and tra in ing institutions; and strengthening the qua l i ty o f p r ima ry and 
secondary education delivery; 
imp rov ing the bus iness environment through: addressing monopo ly p r i c i n g in rema in ing telecom 
segments; imp rov ing oversight o f e lec tr ic i ty u t i l i t ies to reduce costs; formu la t ing and imp lemen t ing 
an air transport compe t i t ion po l icy ; re fo rm ing petroleum p r ic ing mechanisms; upda t ing tour ism 
strategies to target new market segments and strengthening investment and tou r ism promotion, wh i le 
pro tec t ing the natural environment o n wh ich tour ism i s based; and 
establishing and adopting r i s k m i t iga t ion measures to offset the effects o f na tura l disasters, to wh ich 
the small states are pa r t icu la r ly vulnerable. 
33. 
F i n a n c i a l Sector . In the OECS, the f inanc ia l sector i s re la t ive ly deep and has achieved an impressive 
reach, p rov id ing access to some fo rma l f inanc ia l services fo r a very large share o f the population. W h i l e 
banks are generally highly liquid and capital adequacy leve ls have remained stable, a 2003 j o i n t Bank - IMF 
FSAP h igh l igh ted a number o f emerging r i s k s . 
In add i t ion to the concentration o f asset por t fo l ios , in 
par t icu lar large exposures to the pub l ic sector and mortgage market, these include: (i) weaknesses in the 
regu la tory and supervisory framework fo r bank supervision re la t ive to the requirements o f the Base1 Core 
Principles, inc lud ing lack o f enforcement capacity; (ii) weaknesses in fo l low -up actions, as w e l l as inadequate 
frequency o f on-site inspections; and (iii) a substantial share o f non-per form ing loans in An t igua and Barbuda 
(21 percent), Dom in ica (47 percent) and St. Luc ia (24 percent). 
34. 
Perhaps most important among the emerging risks are those associated w i t h the f isca l pressures in the 
region. Several indigenous banks are highly exposed to their loca l pub l ic sector, and the rap id build-up in 
government bo r row ing in some jur isd ic t ions , combined w i t h sizable domestic arrears by these governments, 
raises a key concern that, i f the current s i tua t ion continues o r deteriorates, the central bank may be ca l led upon 
to meet a l iqu id i ty need attributable, d i rec t ly o r ind irec t ly , to government arrears. Such support cou ld pose a 
threat to the c red ib i l i ty o f the currency peg that i s the basis o f the s tab i l i ty in the ECCU . 
35. 
The ro le o f t h e Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in the development o f the f inanc ia l sector 
has been considerable. I t has p laced i tse l f at the service o f the OECS governments in energetically and 
imag ina t ive ly p romo t ing th ree in te r l inked prongs o f f inanc ia l sector po l icy : (i) maintenance o f monetary 
stability; (ii) protection o f the safety and soundness o f the banking institutions; and (iii) market development.

Each o f these contributes to f inanc ia l stability and each i s also needed for increasing the con tr ibu t ion o f 
finance to growth. Emerging r i s k s to the ECCU now ca l l for a renewed e f for t o n the part o f the ECCB to take 
a more for thr igh t r o l e in protecting the soundness o f the OECS f inanc ia l system as a whole. This e f for t w i l l 
requ ire a refocusing o f i t s resources. So far, there has been l im i ted progress in f inanc ia l sector reform. The 
ECC B has rev ised i t s prudential gu ide l ines on capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and corporate 
governance standards in l i n e w i t h some o f the recommendations o f the recently completed FSAP. However, 
revisions to the U n i f o r m Bank ing A c t that was approved by the ECCB ’s Mone tary Counc i l in 2004 have no t 
been enacted by the OECS countries, and the ECCB Agreement A c t has no t yet been amended to enhance the 
ECCB ’s supervisory powers. Wh i le some countries have strengthened the supervision o f the offshore sector, 
there are curren t ly n o plans to a l ign the prudential regimes o f offshore banks w i t h the U n i f o rm Bank ing Act, 
as recommended in the FSAP. 
36. 
Access to f inanc ing remains a constraint for the OECS economies, especially fo r M ic ro , Sma l l and 
Medium Enterprises, (MSMEs,). I s s u e s include: (i) undercapitalized companies; (ii) short term instruments 
used to fund long - te rm needs; (iii) lack o f risk capital (equity and quasi-equity instruments); (iv) l im i ted 
structuring expertise; and (v) underdeveloped f inanc ia l markets w i t h v i r tua l ly n o products other than 
trad i t iona l bank ing products. O f particular concern fo r MSMEs i s the app l ica t ion o f conservative standards fo r 
credit screening such as preference towards successful business establishments and over collateralization. 
A l though there has been some progress in the past couple o f years, the OECS f inanc ia l markets need further 
in tegra t ion and modern iza t ion to e f f ic ien t ly mob i l ize funds f r om larger economies such as T r in idad and 
Tobago, Jamaica, and Barbados. 
The OECS countries have encouraged the g row th o f the ir f inanc ia l sectors to d ivers i fy away f r om 
trad i t iona l agr icu l tura l activities in order to l im i t the economic impac t o f na tura l disasters. In the past, 
in i t ia t ives undertaken b y the OECS countries to promote the f inanc ia l sector w i t h l im i t e d regulatory oversight 
have l e d to a g row th in offshore f inanc ia l in termed ia t ion and w i t h i t attracted f lows o f leg i t ima te and 
po ten t ia l ly i l leg i t ima te capital. The geographic loca t ion o f the OECS countries makes them a strategic trans- 
shipment po in t fo r i l l i c i t drugs f l ow i n g between South Amer ica and the United States and Europe. 
38. 
F inanc ia l regu la tory po l ic ies w i t h i n the OECS countries during the 1990s raised in terna t iona l money 
laundering concerns that are be ing addressed. The Un i ted States Treasury Department issued an advisory 
against An t igua and Barbuda in 1999 because o f concerns over the country’s regu la t ion o f the offshore 
financial 
sector. Be tween 2000 and 2001, the F inanc ia l A c t i o n Task Force o n Money Launder ing (FATF) 
iden t i f ied An t igua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. K i t t s and Nevis, and S t . V incen t and the Grenadines 
as Non-Cooperative Countries o r Terr i tor ies (NCCT) in the fight against money laundering. FATF did no t l i s t 
St. Luc ia as an NCC T . In l igh t o f the international pressure, each OECS coun try has taken important steps to 
build anti-money launder ing and combating the f inanc ing o f terror ism ( AM L /C F T ) regimes in accordance 
w i t h international standards. The OECS countries have enacted o r have taken steps to enact AML and CFT 
legislation, tightened regu la tory controls o n the f inanc ia l sector, especially the offshore sector and established 
financial in te l l igence units to combat money laundering among other measures. Some o f the OECS countries 
have had money laundering prosecutions. In recogn i t ion o f these measures, the Un i ted States w i thdrew i t s 
advisory o n An t igua and Barbuda in 2001 and by 2003 the FATF had removed a l l o f the OECS countries o n 
i t s N C C T l is t . The OECS countries continue to t a k e steps to enhance the ir programs to combat money 
laundering. Challenges rema in in imp lemen t ing AML measures and adopting comprehensive C F T regimes. 
39. 
The W o r l d Bank’s F inanc ia l Ma rke t In teg r i ty O f f i c e (FSEFI) has wo rked w i t h the OECS countries to 
support their A M L / C F T efforts in numerous ways. FSEFI stands ready t o p rov ide additional technical 
assistance as needed. 
Infrastructure. The infrastructure challenge fo r the OECS countries i s no t one o f access but rather 
one o f performance in service delivery, par t icu lar ly in terms o f a f fo rdab i l i ty and f inanc ia l sustainability . 
Reflecting government po l ic ies that have put services high o n the po l i t ica l agenda, the OECS countries have 
been successful in increasing access t o e lec tr ic i ty and water. 
E lec t r i f ica t ion rates exceed 95 percent and access to water i s generally reported to be h igher than 
41, 
access to electricity. 
(Sewage networks, however, are less extensive than water supply networks, and 
wastewater i s o f ten inadequately treated p r io r to discharge, wh ich has detrimental effects o n b o t h hea l th and 
the environment). 
42. 
No tw i ths tand ing these high rates o f access, discrepancies remain, w i t h e lec tr ic i ty tariffs, fo r example, 
in St. K i t ts , St. Luc ia s ign i f ican t ly be low those in Grenada, St. V incen t and the Grenadines, An t igua and

Barbuda, Nevis, and Dom in icaz3 . This can be explained, at least in part, by differences in po l ic ies and 
institutions, that i s , b y decisions on issues such as regulation, pr iva te or pub l ic operation and the extent o f 
compe t i t ion in service provision, and regulation design. There i s a strong pos i t ive corre la t ion between 
measures o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity and measures o f infrastructure performance. 
Te lecommun icat ions a n d U t i l i t ies . The successful l ibera l iza t ion o f the telecommunications sub- 
sector has arguably been the success story in i n f r a ~ t r u c t u r e 2 ~ ~ 
implemented w i t h the assistance o f the W o r l d 
Bank . This was accomplished through the establishment o f the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications 
Au tho r i ty (ECTEL), a regional regulatory agency--which i s be ing further strengthened under a fo l low -on 
FY05 operation and lega l and regulatory reforms in the sector. S im i lar reg iona l regu la tory approaches, wh ich 
promo te e f fec t ive regu la t ion despite l im i ted national capacity constraints, cou ld be adapted w i t h pos i t ive 
r e s u l t s t o the water and e lec tr ic i ty sectors. 
In e lec tr ic i ty , several Eastern Caribbean u t i l i t ies , bo th pub l ic and private, have l i t t l e in the way o f 
regu la tory incentives to optimize their capacity planning, fue l choices, procurement, and other cost dr ivers . 
This contrasts w i t h Barbados and Jamaica, where regulatory agencies e f fec t ive ly supervise the u t i l i t i e s 
p rov id ing incentives fo r increased e f f ic iency and improved service. Private ownership o f u t i l i t ies can also 
help increase e f f ic iency i f the p ro f i t mo t ive can be used to p rov ide incentives to m in im ize costs. The OECS 
entities cou ld consider establishing a reg iona l regulator s im i lar to E C T E L to exert additional pressure fo r 
e f f ic iency o n e lec tr ic i ty companies that are no t curren t ly subject to regulatory oversight. I t seems unlikely 
that any coun try in the OECS possesses the scale and d ivers i ty in e lec tr ic i ty generation to benefit f r om a 
compe t i t ive power market. A better mode l may be to subject the incumbent u t i l i t ies ' generation-capacity 
expansion plans to pub l ic and regulatory scrutiny, and to requ i re them to purchase power f r om independent 
providers in cases where i t can be shown to lowe r to ta l system costs. This approach cou ld resu l t in lowe r 
ta r i f fs and increased opportunities for co-generation and use o f renewable resources. Recogn iz ing the 
importance o f imp rov ing the regulatory environment, Dom in ica i s ac t ive ly pursuing an e lec tr ic i ty sector

W a t e r in the Caribbean, wh ich i s prov ided through government owned and operated water service 
providers, i s an inherently po l i t ica l issue, and reforms that recognize t h i s fact may u l t ima te ly be the ones that 
become sustainable. 
Water de l ivery i s also the worst pe r fo rm ing o f the OECS u t i l i t y sectors and i s characterized by i t s 
ine f f ic ien t operation, ta r i f fs wh ich are o f ten too l o w to recover costs, overstaffing and an inab i l i ty to attract 
finance fo r new investment to improve and extend services. A number o f solutions have been proposed: (i) 
Pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion through operating (lease/affermage)- type contracts that give pr iva te f i r m s true 
management control; require them to meet de f ined targets; and lock - in well-designed t a r i f f and subsidy 
regimes; (ii) Exp l ic i t , targeted subsidies pa id fo r p rov is ion o f outputs, to address social concerns in water 
pr ic ing , and to expand access; (iii) Development agency finance o f capital expenditure, either directly, o r 
through loans to establish subsidy funds; (iv) Government respons ib i l i ty fo r f inanc ing some o r a l l 
investments, either d irec t ly o r through pay ing o f output-based subsidies to expand service; and (v) 
Performance-based contracts fo r de f ined elements o f t h e service, such as meter reading, billing and 
collections. 
I t i s also wo r th no t ing that coastal infrastructure i s par t icu lar ly vulnerable to c l ima te change 
impacts (rise in sea level, increased c l ima te var iab i l i ty) and that the anticipated impacts in saline in t rus ion of 
acquifers caused by sea leve l r ise , w i l l further tax the ab i l i ty t o supply freshwater. 
T ranspo r ta t ion . Overall, there i s scope fo r s ign i f ican t ly imp rov ing the reach and qua l i ty o f the 
transport sector w i t h i n the OECS. Shipping capacity i s adequate and i s p r iva te ly p rov ided in a compe t i t ive 
market. Air transport, however, continues to frustrate the scope fo r g row th and competitiveness and p o l i c y 
changes cou ld s ign i f ican t ly increase the qua l i ty o f service and reduce costs. Other i s s u e s that requ i re attention 
include: (i) imp rov ing safety standards t o comp ly w i t h in terna t iona l requirements; and (ii) enhancing term ina l 
capacity at airports. Roads in the OECS are p o o r l y constructed and represent a s ign i f ican t d ra in o n

The greatest ga in to international transport in the reg ion wou ld come through rap id l ibera l iza t ion o f

as LIAT, which, in their current form, are arguably f inanc ia l l iab i l i t ies and no t assets. However, governments 
are rightly concerned about their ab i l i ty t o ensure re l iab le and adequate a ir services, and wo r ry that a purely 
market-based approach cou ld be too r i s k y . This concern cou ld be addressed by asking airlines to bid on non- 
exclusive contracts, under wh ich they wou ld comm i t to prov ide specific capacities and schedules o n key 
routes in exchange for a subsidy. Compe t i t ive ly awarding such contracts wou ld assure governments that 
services wou ld be prov ided wh i le simultaneously engaging lower and more transparent subsidies than the 
alternative o f supporting na t iona l and reg iona l carriers.

Vulnerability to Na tu ra l Disasters. The OECS countries are among the most disaster-prone in the 
world, by measures such as frequency, popu la t ion affected, and value o f damage. A j o i n t Commonwea l th 
S e c r e t a r i aw o r l d Bank Task Force o n Sma l l States study wh ich comp i led a composite vu lnerab i l i ty index 
places fou r o f the OECS countries in the top 20 (out o f 11 1 developing countries, wh ich includes a l l small 
states) with the rema in ing tw o closely behind in the top thirty. 
Based on the experience since 1970, a large natural disaster, i n f l i c t i n g damage equivalent to more 
than 2 percent o f the affected country’s GDP, can be expected to h i t the reg ion rough ly every 2.5 years. The 
short and med ium- term impacts o f na tura l disasters inc lude (i) an immediate contraction in economic output; 
(ii) a worsening o f external balances; (iii) a deterioration in fiscal balances; and (iv) an increase in poverty. 
The long- term impacts may include (i) environmental degradation; (ii) capital flight, bank and o r balance o f 
payments crises; (iii) c rowd ing out o f produc t ive pub l ic spending due to reconstruction efforts; and (iv) 
increased indebtedness wh ich in tu rn may raise the rate o f interest reduc ing future investment. Depending o n 
the scale o f the disaster, other sectoral repercussions can be fe l t : the destruction o f schools may, fo r example, 
retard educational progress.

In 2004, one o f the most active seasons fo r t rop ica l storms and hurricanes o n record since 1950, tw ice 
as many o f these na tura l phenomena were registered. Hurr icane Ivan, the longest-lasting hurricane since 
1900, devastated Grenada, decimating the housing stock and causing an estimated EC$2bn (US$800 m i l l ion ) 
o f damage (St. V incen t and the Grenadines was also affected by Hurr icane Ivan , though to a much lesser 
extent). In S t . K i t t s and Nevis, Hurr icane George caused more than US$400 m i l l i o n o f damage in 1998, just 9 
years after Hurr icane Hugo . Dom in ica was also recen t ly struck by an earthquake, measuring 6.0 o n the 
R ich ter scale, causing damages estimated at 7 percent o f 2004 GDP. In 2005, the hurricane season began 
earlier than normal, w i t h T rop ica l S torm Emily causing add i t iona l damage wh i le passing over Grenada. 
The cost o f natural disasters to ind iv idua l countries can be substantially mitigated. 
Insurance and 
capital markets can offset losses and the adoption o f good building practices, to in terna t iona l standards, can 
s ign i f ican t ly lowe r the leve l o f impact. Hurr icane I v a n provides a good example: the on ly schools that were 
le f t untouched in Grenada were tw o built w i t h Bank assistance designed w i t h r igorous attention pa id to 
hurricane-proof standards.

Disaster risk m i t iga t ion measures, such as appropriate zon ing and hazard mapping, establishment and 
enforcement o f building codes, and disaster in fo rma t ion mechanisms should be promoted. These measures 
can reduce loss o f l i fe , infrastructure damage, and the cost o f ex-post insurance. Assisting reg iona l co- 
operation and co-ordination o f disaster r i s k m i t iga t ion strategies i s important. The mu l t i la tera l development 
and finance ins t i tu t ions can he lp in this through: the p rov is ion o f technical assistance and f inanc ia l resources; 
p romo t ing t h e exchange o f in forma t ion o n successful practice; and assisting reg iona l co-operation and 
coord ina t ion o f disaster risk m i t iga t ion strategies. Dono r finance fo r m i t iga t ion measures, fo r example in 
infrastructure, in sma l l states subject to repeated natural disasters can have a very high pay-o f f . 
G iven the small size o f their economies, the OECS countries are s im i la r ly susceptible to other 
external shocks. The September 11, 2001 attacks and accompanying f a l l in tour ism ac t iv i t ies had a significant 
impact o n tourism, the most important source o f fore ign revenue. The recent increase in o i l prices has also 
strained these sma l l economies. Fluctuations in rea l interest rates and possible cross-country contagion 
ar is ing f r om bank ing and currency crises are other possible shocks. These vulnerabilities po in t to the need fo r 
the OECS economies to diversify their service export markets; strengthen their f isca l positions and reduce 
debt leve ls ; and reduce r ig id i t ies in their labor markets. 
The United Na t ions Framework Conven t ion o n C l ima te Change (UNFCCC) has iden t i f ied sma l l 
is land nations as amongst the most vulnerable to anticipated impacts f r om c l ima te change. Those impacts- 
likely to h i t coastal areas where a significant share o f economic ac t iv i ty takes place-are 
a result o f 
externalities large ly caused by resource intensive societies w i t h a resultant significant effect o n sustainable 
development in these already frag i le islands. Specifically, in terms o f coastal 
i t i s expected that 
cora l r e e f s w i l l be affected and may collapse, i f seasonal max imum temperature sea surface temperatures 
increase even s l igh t ly . In addition, increases in C 0 2 w i l l affect the ab i l i ty o f r e e f plants and animals to ca lc i fy 
and thus reduce the ab i l i ty o f reefs to grow ver t ica l ly and keep pace w i t h anticipated r is ing sea levels. Also, in 
near-shore mar ine and coastal areas, many wetlands w i l l be affected by changes in s torm surges. These may 
result in large-scale translocation o f populations in l ow - l y i n g areas. Mangroves and coastal lagoons are 
expected to undergo rap id change and perhaps be lost altogether as func t ion ing ecosystems. L ow - l y i n g coastal 
areas and associated swamps cou ld also be displaced by saltwater habitats, d isrup t ing freshwater ecosystems. 
Such changes are likely to result in d is loca t ion o f m ig ra to ry birds and aquatic species that are no t tolerant to 
increased sa l in i ty o r f lood ing and may even force large scale forced resettlement o f coastal areas. 
Ag r icu l tu ra l T rans i t ion . The share o f agriculture as a percentage o f GDP has dropped dramatically, 
f r om 15 percent in the 1980s to 8 percent in 2000, and i t continues to decline. There are two ma in reasons fo r 
this: (i) agriculture as i t i s practiced in the OECS countries i s no longer competitive: f a r m s are very sma l l (2- 
3 ha on average), many soils are degraded and hence p roduc t iv i ty i s very l o w compared to other producers26 
and (ii) the erosion o f EU agr icu l tura l preferences which, u n t i l recently, guaranteed re la t ive ly high prices and 
markets through quotas. Only the very e f f ic ien t producers and marketers can compete in the high vo lume 
non-differentiated markets.

Ag r icu l tu ra l trade preferences are set to end in 2007. Even w i thou t t h i s impend ing change, the OECS 
countries have no t been able to fill the quotas at compe t i t ive prices. The reduc t ion o f EU preferences for 
bananas and sugar in the OECS has created a b ru ta l shock fo r the ru ra l economies. The EU quota preferences 
have created an ago-econom ic environment that was no t conducive to d ivers i f ica t ion neither in production, 
no r in marke t ing or agro processing. A lmos t a l l the food fo r the non-rura l popu la t ion and the ho te l industry i s 
impor ted f r om the USA o r other countries in the Caribbean. I t wou ld appear that the agr icu l tura l po l ic ies o f 
the OECS--to rema in focused o n trad i t iona l crops and to discourage loca l food p roduc t ion and processing in 
par t icu lar high value foods, and perishable fruit and vegetables as w e l l as staples--has failed. The move f r om 
trad i t iona l crops has also been stymied because agriculture i s s t i l l strongly in f luenced by government 
in terven t ion (state production) and p r ~ t e c t i o n ~ ~ . A key challenge w i l l be finding alternative sources o f 
employment fo r the farmers affected by the impend ing change in preferences, estimated to be 15 percent o f 
the to ta l workforce, who are large ly o lder and less educated. In the banana indus try alone, t h e numbers o f 
registered and active growers have dropped f r om around 10,000 to 2,000 and those de r iv ing a l l o r an 
important propor t ion o f the ir earnings f rom bananas have fa l len f r om around 30,000 t o under 6,000. 
T o support agr icu l tura l diversification, Governments cou ld : (i) s h i f t social support t o ru ra l areas f rom 
subsidies fo r particular trad i t iona l crops (bananas, sugar, nutmeg) to fam i ly income support (cash transfers); 
(ii) help attract fore ign investment in agr icu l ture ( for instance returning migrants) to set up o r f inanc ia l ly

participate in sizeable farm en te rp r ises that can t ime ly prov ide the market with qua l i ty produce in su f f ic ien t 
quantities; (iii) help finance tra in ing o f young farmers in modem farm ing and marke t ing techniques; (iv) 
encourage linkages between t h e farm ing sector and the ho te l industry or other commercial pr iva te sector in 
order to create a loca l market fo r loca l produce; and (v) help the small-scale agro-processing sector to 
trans form loca l produce in to products (jams, spices, oils) that can be so ld to v is i t ing tourists o r in ethnic 
markets abroad. Las t ly , OECS countries w i l l have to ensure adequate land u s e p lann ing to protect f e r t i l e land 
from be ing occupied b y human settlements. 
The Bank has no t been active in the agricultural sector in the OECS countries, as there i s significant 
support f rom the European U n i o n through a variety o f specially-established funds such as SFA and 
STA13EX28 Nevertheless, the Bank, in collaboration w i t h FAO /CP Investment Center i s carry ing out a study 
o n successful d ivers i f ica t ion in i t ia t ives in the sub-region. 
Environment. T o rema in competitive in the tour ism industry and to reduce the impact o f climate 
change and na tura l disasters, the OECS countries w i l l have to enhance the ir efforts to preserve and protect the 
na tura l environment. Tou r ism remains highly concentrated in coastal zones, dependent o n the ava i lab i l i ty and 
beauty o f the na tura l assets o f the coast and near-shore marine waters. These coastal areas are also the 
p r inc ipa l sites fo r human settlements and development and poo r ly planned development projects pose a 
g row ing risk to the “health” o f the natural resources and surrounding environment. In seeking growth, the 
OECS needs to ensure that the environment i s no t undermined, cheapening the Caribbean tour ism “brand” in 
the face o f increasing competition. 
The key environmental problems in the OECS are: degradation o f cora l reefs and other highly 
produc t ive coastal and near-shore marine habitats, loss o f marine biodiversity, declines in the environmental 
qua l i ty o f beaches and adjacent waters, a deteriorating landscape and an increasing susceptibility to na tura l 
disasters, Some o f t h e causes inc lude lack o f wastewater treatment, agro-industrial po l lu t ion , agr icu l tura l run- 
off and so i l erosion, and lack o f housing p lann ing and building regulations. The problems are exacerbated by 
t h e weak pub l ic sector capacity to address environmental issues and the anticipated ravages caused by c l ima te 
change. Also, there i s a lack o f f inanc ia l resources to mon i to r and address t h e problems. But there are also 
ma jo r ins t i tu t iona l shortcomings inc lud ing : (i) the lack o f a systematic mon i to r ing program; (ii) weaknesses in 
leg is la t ion and accompanying regulations; and (iii) lack o f transparency and pub l ic disclosure (at least in 
practice). Addressing the i s s u e o f environmental management w i l l no t on ly bene f i t OECS citizens and the 
tourist industry, bu t w i l l also strengthen the island’s de fenses to na tura l hazards. Fo r example phys ica l 
m i t iga t ion measures taken to ensu re that coastal regions are protected f r om erosion w i l l he lp deflect the brunt 
of hurricanes and promo t ing watershed management w i l l protect the reg ion f r om f lood ing . 
There has been progress in some areas o f environmental management in the OECS sub-region, driven 
by (i) what appears to be a g row ing demand for, and pub l ic and p r iva te response to, opportunities in the 
ecotourism n iche market; (ii) enlightened self-interest among tourist operators in pro tec t ing the environment; 
and (iii) a re la t ive ly well-educated popu la t ion becoming more conscious o f environmental qua l i ty concems. 
B u t much remains to b e done, pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f sub-regional-wide mon i to r ing o f c r i t ica l ecosystems; 
po l icy reforms; reg iona l and na t iona l ins t i tu t iona l strengthening; and pub l ic awareness. 
Global climate change i s a ma jo r challenge to environmental sustainability. 
Is land nations, 
inc lud ing those in the Caribbean, are experiencing the brunt o f changes l inked to increased sea levels, 
increased sea surface temperature, reduced precipitation, increased c l ima te va r iab i l i ty and other related 
changes. The impacts o f c l ima te change also affect the na tura l resources o n wh ich key economic ac t iv i ty 
depends, such as f ishe r ies and tour ism . W h i l e many o f these changes are irreversible, some can be m i t iga ted 
and many others w i l l require adaptation measures to cope with the anticipated impacts. The Bank has been 
active in the sub-region through the G loba l Env ironmen ta l Fac i l i ty that funds the Ma ins tream ing Adap ta t ion 
to C l ima te Change Project (MACC ) building ins t i tu t iona l capacity and developing c l ima te change adaptation 
strategies in the Caribbean. M o r e specific c l ima te change adaptation investment projects are under 
development in St. Lucia, Dom in ica and St. V incen t and the Grenadines.

In add i t ion to ongoing M A C C efforts in the region, the Bank w i l l selectively pursue opportunities in 
carbon finance, under the gu ide l ines o f the K y o t o Protocol, that cou ld contribute to ecosystem restoration. A 
pro jec t in T r in idad and Tobago (Nariva Wetland restoration) exemplifies the approach to be taken. 

T h e Ins t i tu t iona l Con tex t 

65. 
The pub l ic sector in the OECS countries has several pos i t ive characteristics, no tab ly the existence o f a 
permanent pub l ic service that provides continuity, ins t i tu t iona l memory and s tab i l i ty at the administrative 
level, irrespective o f who r u l e s at the po l i t ica l leve l ; the existence o f well-established organizational structures 
and ins t i tu t iona l rules and regulations; and the general respect o f the ru le o f law and a high degree o f jud ic ia l 
independence. There i s also l i t t l e evidence o f widespread systemic corruption. However, despite these 
strengths and some OECS countries’ recent efforts to modernize their pub l ic sectors, the latter have fa i led to 
adapt to the changing external environment. Indeed, in order to better compete in the g loba l economy, the 
OECS countries w i l l need to improve their pub l ic sector’s organizational structures and enhance e f f ic iency 
and cost effectiveness o f the de l ivery o f pub l ic services. 
66. 
Feedback f r om consultations w i t h the pr iva te sector iden t i f ied the need fo r a more nurturing 
environment fo r successful pr iva te sector development; and several s tud ies have h igh l igh ted inadequate 
incentives and accountability for pub l ic sector performance, the existence o f weak in terna l con t ro l systems 
and oversight bodies, and inadequate mechanisms for regular evaluation o f policies, programs, projects and 
pub l ic agency performance. In add i t ion to these ins t i tu t iona l problems, serious organizational capacity 
constraints exist. Even though the OECS countries are sma l l and have extremely limited resources, the span 
o f the ir pub l ic sector functions matches that o f many large countries. G iven their size and although most 
governments have undertaken steps to pr iva t ize or commercialize some o f the ir functions, their mandate 
continues to be too w ide vis-&vis their ab i l i ty to deliver o n it. Another c r i t ica l deficiency o f the pub l ic sector 
in the OECS i s the insufficiency o f qualified persons to run the bus iness o f the State-again due to the ir sma l l 
size, wh ich i s compounded by the m ig ra t ion o f sk i l led staff. 
67. 
In several areas, capacity constraints and diseconomies o f sma l l scale can be addressed through 
reg iona l in tegra t ion and cooperation, yet the p r inc ip le hurdles rema in the perceived pro tec t ion o f sovereignty, 
insu f f ic ien t pub l ic in fo rma t ion o n the bene f i ts o f integration, and a w ide gap between po l i t ica l support and 
implementation. The OECS countries have made some progress in reg iona l in tegra t ion and cooperation. 
Recogn iz ing these efforts, under t h e 2002-2005 CAS the Bank has been supporting OECS reg iona l in tegra t ion 
efforts in the areas o f telecommunications, environmental management, H I V / A I D S and education sector 
re form . However, i t i s broad ly acknowledged by clients and donors a l ike that the scope o f reg iona l and sub- 
reg iona l economic in tegra t ion and functional cooperation have no t been exp lo i ted to their full potential. 
68. 
In l igh t o f the above, the Bank has recently been wo rk ing w i t h the ECC B and the OECS Secretariat 
o n the fo rmu la t ion o f an OECS pub l ic sector transformation strategy, pulling together a group o f respected 
change agents f r om the reg ion to present approaches to the Heads. Under th is strategy, pub l ic op in ion p o l l i n g 
o n attitudes towards pub l ic service de l ivery were 
This approach o f t ry ing to crys ta l l ize home- 
g rown strategies offers a mode l for re form in a number o f other areas in the CAS, such as you th and social 
protection. The strategy w o u l d focus on actions to modernize pub l ic administration, enhance g row th 
supporting pub l ic services, ra t iona l ize the de l ivery o f social services through more effective and a f fordab le 
modes o f service delivery, and improve their targeting. In terven t ions cou ld include: refocusing the scope of 
pub l ic sector activities to ma tch capacity; in tens i fy ing e f for ts to reap economies o f scale and imp rove 
e f f ic iency by enhancing reg iona l and sub-regional in tegra t ion and cooperation; comp le t ing ins t i tu t iona l and 
capacity building reforms and imp rov ing the ins t i tu t iona l framework o f human resource management in the 
pub l ic sector; imp rov ing the investment c l ima te to promo te p r iva te sector development; and increasing the 
transparency o f the pub l ic sector by imp rov ing dissemination o f in fo rma t ion to the pub l ic and intensifying 
c i v i l society consultation and participation, inc lud ing the use o f pub l ic service de l ivery “score-cards”. 
Increased reg iona l cooperation and in tegra t ion o f selected pub l ic sector services (e.g., procurement, auditing) 
and regulatory frameworks for pub l ic u t i l i t ies (see para 40) are other c r i t ica l areas fo r pub l ic sector 
transformation in t h e OECS countries wh ich can help overcome their diseconomies o f scale. 

29 As a first step i n this process, the OECS Heads o f Govemment were presented with a note on “Public Sector Transformation”, 
prepared by the ECCB and OECS with Bank support, at the OECS Heads o f Govemment meeting on November 1 1,2004.

69. 
Recogn iz ing the need for a sub-regional organization to assist the OECS countries in their 
development efforts, a series o f institutions were established post-independence, The most recent incama t ion 
o f these i s the OECS Secretariat, wh ich was established in 1981. I t s o r ig ina l mandate, set out in the Treaty o f 
Basseterre, was to promote cooperation and economic integration among the Member States, and defend the ir 
sovereignty, te r r i to r ia l in tegr i ty and independence; this has recently evolved to inc lude a focus on research 
and strategic p o l i c y advice, resource mob i l iza t ion and technical support. 
70. 
F o l l ow i n g a per iod o f weak management, the new Director-General assumed the he lm o f the 
Secretariat, wh ich has 100 s ta f f (ha l f the size o f the Caribbean Development Bank) jus t over two years ago. 
Since then the organization has undergone restructuring to re f lec t the new po l icy and advisory focus o f i t s 
wo rk . The Secretariat’s ab i l i ty to deliver on i ts mandate has to date been severely constrained by: (i) i t s lack 
o f capacity at a l l leve ls ; (ii) i ts l im i ted f inanc ia l resources, exacerbated by members countries’ inab i l i ty to 
pay; and (iii) the lack o f much needed po l i t ica l support to move forward o n reg iona l in i t ia t ives . 
71. 
In October 2002, the OECS Member States ra t i f ied the OECS Development Charter, wh ich was 
developed over several years by the OECS Secretariat and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. The Charter 
maps out, in broad terms , a v is ion for the long- term development o f the OECS and seeks to stimulate a 
dialogue around the fo l low ing : 
The de f in i t ion o f new economic parameters for growth; 
In tegra t ing social and environmental parameters in to the development agenda; 
M o b i l i z i n g a wider cross-section o f donors as partners in the development agenda; and; 
A greater inc lus ion o f the pr iva te sector, c i v i l society and communities. 
W h i l e the core socio-economic development pr ior i t ies contained in the Charter f o rm the framework 
w i t h i n wh ich the OECS Secretariat can begin a dialogue between the sub-region’s Governments and w i t h 
donors, the Charter lacks focus, mak ing i t d i f f icu l t for donors to plan their assistance in l i n e w i t h reg iona l 
p r io r i t ies Cove r ing everything f r om reduc ing pover ty to t h e development o f sports, increasing access to 
qua l i ty education to good governance, the Charter lacks spec i f ic i ty and a p r io r i t iza t ion o f key interventions 
and reforms needed in light o f the OECS countries’ mu l t ip le challenges and l im i ted capacity. 
73. 
There a re a number o f sectoral strategies in place, progress on wh ich appears to be stagnant, and a l l o f 
wh ich have entailed the establishment o f a un i t w i t h i n the Secretariat to address thematic o r sectoral 
challenges, be they environmental management, educational or jud ic ia l re form . Wha t appears to be a 
s tumb l ing b lock , however, i s the ab i l i ty to draw up imp lemen ta t ion plans and po l icy directives.

Progress made on OECS reg iona l in teg ra t ion 

74. 
T o date, there have been limited, but no tewor thy success stories o n reg iona l integration. The Eastern 
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) i s w ide ly recognized as a firm and steady hand o n ma in ta in ing the s tab i l i ty 
o f the EC do l la r and the in teg r i ty o f the OECS members’ bank ing system. Tha t said, no tw i ths tand ing a 
common central bank and a common currency, the OECS countries conduct f isca l po l icy independently and 
the deterioration o f f isca l positions in recent years has re- in i t ia ted discussion among i t s members o n the need 
t o better coordinate fiscal po l ic ies . 
75. 
Subordinating national interests to a reg iona l en t i ty has been fully achieved elsewhere: (i) E C T E L 
(discussed earlier), the world’s f irs t reg iona l telecommunications authority, broke the monopo ly o f Cable and 
W i re less , resu l t ing in greater compe t i t ion and imp roved access; (ii) the OECS Pharmaceutical Procurement 
Service (PPS), a successful reg iona l apparatus wh ich regulates, negotiates and procures pharmaceuticals 
region-wide; (iii) t h e Eastern Caribbean Supreme Cour t (ECSC), wh ich has unlimited ju r isd ic t ion across the 
sub-region’s states and territories; and (iv) t h e D irec tora te o f C i v i l Av ia t ion (DCA), a veh ic le for fac i l i ta t ing a 
co l lec t ive and u n i f o rm approach to c i v i l av ia t ion matters a f fec t ing the Eastern Caribbean.

A l though donor assistance has been dec l in ing to the sub-region30, the OECS i s w e l l served by several 
b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l agencies, inc lud ing the C D B (wh ich also on-lends IDB funds), EU, OAS, the W o r l d 
Bank and the UN, and, for the bilaterals, C IDA , DFID, USAID, China, Japan, Kuwa i t , France, and Taiwan, 
China. W i t h i n the overa l l context o f external assistance, the Bank’s con tr ibu t ion i s re la t ive ly small, 
accounting for around 10 percent o f to ta l disbursements. W h i l e relations w i t h the donor commun i ty are good, 
and the dialogue active, overa l l coordination in the OECS i s fragmented. In some countries and some sectors, 
there i s overcrowd ing (as in the case o f education in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, or regional trade issues), 
w h i l e in other areas (youth) there appears to be a lack o f technical expertise, matched by an absence o f 
resources. Donors and OECS Governments a l ike recognize the need to move beyond meetings and analysis 
t o implementation, bu t the rhetoric has yet to be matched by ac t ion on the part o f b o t h governments and 
donors.

There have, however, been recent pos i t ive moves towards greater coord ina t ion and harmonization. In 
Dom in ica , wh ich has undertaken a ma jor economic stabilization and adjustment effort, the donors have ra l l ied 
to support this program by closely coordinating and p r io r i t iz ing the p rov is ion o f their f inanc ia l support and 
technical assistance to strengthen government capacity for implementation. In par t due to these concerted 
e f for ts and together w i t h government commitment, the Dom in ica program i s being implemented w i t h 
reasonable success. S im i lar ly , in Grenada, fo l low ing the devastation caused by Hurr icane Ivan, donors no t 
on ly turned out in force at two ma jo r donor meetings (one hosted by the Bank in Washington, the other by the 
Government in Grenada), but have also agreed to harmonize procedures, synchronize missions and reporting, 
and select lead donors in the m a i n sectors so as to avo id dup l ica t ion o f efforts. This i s the f i r s t such 
coordinated response to a natural disaster in the Caribbean. 
The Bank i s the on ly ma jo r donor that does no t have a phys ica l presence in Barbados, mak ing 
representation and coord ina t ion more challenging and costly, albeit s ign i f ican t ly cheaper than establishing an 
o f f ice in the sub-region. 
I t should be noted, also, that the Bank does no t lend to Barbados. There are, 
however, numerous fora where donors meet ( inc lud ing the Caribbean Fo rum fo r Development ( former ly the 
CGCED), C D B Annua l Meetings, OECS Secretariat and U N D P Dono r Meetings) and C A R T A C Steering 
Comm i t tee Meetings, and recent efforts to host videoconferenced p lann ing meetings have been w e l l received. 
In add i t ion to greater harmon iza t ion and collaboration w i t h the donors generally, the Bank plans to 
collaborate more closely at bo th the project and analytical and advisory levels, par t icu lar ly w i t h the EU, 
w h i c h has expressed an interest in exp lor ing the p rov is ion o f grant-financed budgetary support against Bank 
and/or IMF programs. In recogn i t ion of the Bank’s technical expertise and g loba l knowledge, the EU i s 
channeling increasing amounts o f (concessional) hnding through the Bank’s projects, using b o t h b i la tera l and 
Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Funds3’. The first o f these Trus t Funds has recen t ly been established in Grenada: the EU 
has allocated €8.4 mn in grant funds for a School Rehab i l i ta t ion Project, t o be administered by the W o r l d 
Bank . The Trust Fund w i l l also cover technical assistance fo r Bank-executed ac t iv i t ies . 

30 Ne t ODA to the six OECS countries, which spiked from US$78 mn i n 2001 to US$121 m n in 2002, decreased to US$49 mn in 
2003. 
3 ’ Since the late 199Os, use of the Bank as a conduit for other donors’ funds has been steadily increasing, from about $ IOm i l l ion in the 
late 1990s to about $450 m i l l i o n i n 2004.

Donors f r om East As ia have played a significant ro le in the sub-region’s development. In the pe r iod 
f r o m 1999 to 2003, Japan disbursed approximately US$116 m i l l i o n to the OECS (US$17 m i l l i o n o f wh ich 
was disbursed in 2003, the most recent f i g u r e s available), w i t h the f ishe r ies sector being the p r ima ry recipient.

NGOs a n d M e d i a . The N G O commun i ty in the OECS sub-region, wh i le vibrant, remains sma l l and 
tends to be commun i ty or country specific in i t s interests. Given i ts size, and resource constraints, there i s 
l im i t e d scope fo r much needed cross-fertilization o f ideas and concerns across islands. Governments have no t 
appeared to consistently inc lude NGOs in the development o f reg iona l strategies and there i s s ign i f ican t scope 
t o increase their ro le in th is regard.

The media, however, wh ich i s deep-rooted w i t h i n OECS society - par t icu lar ly in the area o f rad io 
broadcasts - i s o f ten dependent o n par ty a f f i l ia t ion and can be h igh ly c r i t ica l o f Governments. There are 
around a dozen newspapers across the sub-region, none o f wh ich are dailies. Readership among the m idd le- 
classes i s high and i t i s no t uncommon fo r households to receive two or three competing newspapers per 
week. Coverage tends to be loca l ized and the lack o f a deeply entrenched sub-regional med ia makes the task 
o f mob i l iz ing support fo r reg iona l in tegra t ion more challenging. Wh i le Bank engagement o f t h e med ia in the 
sub-region has been l im i ted in the past, recent Bank efforts to engage the med ia have been successful. An 
OECS pub l ic in fo rma t ion strategy i s curren t ly under development, fo r imp lemen ta t ion through a n ew l y 
established Pub l ic In fo rma t ion Center, based in St. Luc ia . Ongo ing dissemination o f t h e tw o recently

H is to ry o f B a n k Engagement 

91. 
Up u n t i l 1987, the bulk o f Bank lending to the OECS was conducted v i a on-lending f r om lines o f 
credit to the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). The goal o f th is approach was to: (i) channel resources t o 
member countries “at a lower cost than the Bank cou ld do directly”, and (ii) strengthen C D B as a reg iona l 
development ins t i tu t ion . In 1997, th is lend ing approach was discontinued fo l low ing the poor performance o f 
the last three l i n e s o f credit and a reques t f rom the OECS Heads o f Government that the Bank assume direct 
lending. The 2001-2005 CAS was the f irs t CAS to prov ide Bank lend ing and AAA d irec t ly to OECS clients. 
I t had two overarching objectives: (i) reduce income insecurity and vu lne rab i l i ty at the aggregate and 
household leve ls ; and (ii) build human and ins t i tu t iona l capacity. The CAS also ca l led fo r increasing u s e o f 
group operations under sub-regional umbre l la mechanisms (such as hor izon ta l APLs) w i t h the a im o f 
p romo t ing sub-regional integration and achieving cost-effectiveness in Bank operations. F inanc ia l assistance 
was prov ided o n b lend terms (50 percent IDA; 50 percent BRD), under the sma l l is land economies 
exception.

O f the $107 m i l l i o n lend ing program wh ich was envisaged, $79 m i l l i o n (not inc lud ing the HIViAIDS 
program for wh ich the regional commitment was made dur ing the earlier CAS) has been delivered as o f Ju ly 
2005. The ma jo r i ty o f these projects were part o f hor izon ta l APLs or reg iona l programs. Non-programmed 
lend ing comprised the Emergency Recovery operations, the fo l low -on reg iona l telecommunications re fo rm 
project, the fo l low -on St. Luc ia Water Re fo rm project and the Dom in ica Econom ic Recovery Support 
Operation (ERSO) as w e l l as the post-Hurricane I v a n Emergency Recovery loan to Grenada.

There was a significant increase in AAA delivered during the last CAS, the ma jo r i ty o f wh ich was 
core diagnostic w o r k such as PERs, CFAAs and CPARs, the latter two o f wh ich were undertaken and 
presented j o i n t l y as pan-sub-regional analyses, as was the Ins t i tu t iona l and Organizational Capacity Rev iew 
(IOCR)32. A number o f reports, inc lud ing those o n you th and income ins tab i l i ty were prepared fo r discussion 
at the 2002 Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED). The G row th and 
Competitiveness reports were presented at the Caribbean Fo rum fo r Development in Barbados in M a y 2005. 
96 . 
The OECS lend ing and AAA po r t fo l io has benefited

were conducted fo r three o f the projects launched under the 2001-05 CAS and a further two projects f r om the 
previous CAS were evaluated fo r the qua l i ty o f supervision. One Qua l i ty o f ESW Assessment was 
undertaken for the OECS CPAR .

In addition, the sub-region benefited 
f r om a comprehensive Q A G Rev iew o f the Bank’s w o r k in t h e

The C A S Comp le t ion Report (attached in Append ix 1) gives detailed analysis o f the key lessons 
learned over the last CAS period. O n lending33, there i s broad recogn i t ion that the Bank’s technical expertise 
in pro jec t des ign has made a significant con tr ibu t ion to the sub-region’s development. However, pro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion has no t always gone smoothly and a number o f areas were c i ted as con tr ibu t ing to the o f ten 
lackluster imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank projects. One area i s the ove r ly complex pro jec t design, wh ich has l e d to 
leng thy delays in effectiveness and a sense that the project timetable was more Bank-dr iven than client-led. 
This i s pa r t icu la r ly the case fo r APL projects. Wh i le , by using APLs, the Bank captured economies o f scale 
o f preparation and supervision, the OECS clients did no t always capture the reg iona l economies o f scale and 
the opportunities fo r “cross-country learning” inherent in the A P L were no t exploited. Greater attention to 
c l ien t preparedness w i l l be key mov ing fo rwa rd to ensure that reg iona l approaches are more successful and 
that the know ledge gains are fully harnessed. 
The Bank’s procedures are pa r t icu la r ly cumbersome to sma l l states and often, the know ledge o f the 
p le thora o f processes and their paperwork hinges upon the performance o f a Project Management Unit (PMU) 
wh ich in turn may translate to one o r two persons. The absence or departure o f key s ta f f has le f t a 
disproportionate number o f projects pending, further exacerbating tensions between PMUs , Central Tender 
Boards and l i n e ministries. This underscores the need fo r tw o new approaches: (i) simplified procedures 
embodied in simplified instruments, as proposed through the new SCUP (see B o x 7); and (ii) add i t iona l 
t ra in ing in the f iduc iary areas o f f inanc ia l management and procurement fo r f u t u r e operations. Ro l l -ou t o f 
these two elements wou ld ensure that (a) projects are implemented when the c l ien t i s ready and (b) that, once 
effective, the c l ien t has the capacity to bring the projects to t ime ly and successful fru i t ion . 
100. Arguably, where the Bank has had the greatest impac t in i ts lending, has been in two areas. First, 
interventions invo lv ing po l icy reform, such as the Dom in ica ERSO and the E C T E L pro jec t - w h i c h sought, 
respectively, to restore f isca l balance and encourage a resump t ion o f g row th and to dismantle a c r ipp l ing 
telecommunications monopo ly wh i le establishing a regu la tory framework. Second, interventions wh ich 
responded to unforeseen crises-such as the post 9-1 1 Emergency Recovery Loans and the Hurr icane I v a n 
contingency fac i l i ty . The Bank’s wo rk in such situations has been broad ly recognized as demonstrating the 
Bank’s ab i l i ty to bring i ts g loba l know ledge to bear in t h e f i rs t instance and to wo rk f lex ib ly and sw i f t l y w i t h 
b o t h clients and donors under pressure in the second. 
101. There i s s im i la r ly broad acknowledgement fo r the Bank’s ana ly t ica l r igo r in i ts AAA. But wh i le 
AAA i s h igh ly valued by govemments and reg iona l ins t i tu t ions and are w e l l regarded by the academic 

33 I t should be noted, however, that the Bank’s programs have moved relatively swiftly and smoothly compared with other donors’ 
projects.

110. 

In January 2005, the six OECS Heads o f Government, the Governor o f the ECCB and the D irec tor- 
General o f the OECS Secretariat met w i t h the President o f the W o r l d Bank in Grenada. Cognizant o f the need 
fo r increased g row th and improved competitiveness o f their economies, their susceptibility to natural 
disasters, and the po ten t ia l erosion o f social gains, their discussions focused o n the opportunities and 
challenges fac ing the sub-region. K e y among the challenges iden t i f ied were (i) the need to stimulate g row th 
and imp rove competitiveness; (ii) g row ing unemployment, par t icu lar ly among young people; (iii) weak social 
safety nets; (iv) the impac t o f s k i l l s m ig ra t ion and i t s consequences o n the labor market; (v) the need for 
e f f ic iency gains through modernizing the public sector; (vi) the need for increased resilience to natural 
disasters; and (vii) the need to protect the environment. F ina l ly , the challenge o f rea l iz ing reg iona l economies 
o f scale was c lear ly articulated and the example o f EC T E L was lauded as best practice for future 
interventions. 
Against this background, and tak ing in to account the lessons learned f r om the previous CAS, Heads 
o f Government and the Bank agreed on the basic parameters for a new development partnership. 
F o r i ts part, the W o r l d Bank Group would: 
support reg iona l integration through reg iona l interventions - in such areas as catastrophe risk 
insurance; pub l ic sector reform; s k i l l s enhancement and youth-at-risk; and the regulatory framework 
fo r u t i l i t ies ; 
he lp to (i) establish a new partnership between the OECS and the donor community, based o n CD F 
pr inc ip les and (ii) leverage other donor concessional support through innova t ive mechanisms such as 
the creation o f Multi Dono r Trust Funds; 
simplify Bank processes to make them more user-friendly to sma l l states; and 
support capacity building efforts in key areas o f p ro j ect implementation. 
In turn, the sub-region wou ld : 
restore medium-term f isca l and debt sustainability through a m i x o f f isca l adjustment, grow th- 
enhancing structural reforms, improved debt management and possible debt restructuring; 
f lesh out the Development Charter by defining 3-4 key development objectives w i t h clear timelines 
and benchmarks wh ich donors can support, in a coordinated and harmonized fashion, based o n their 
comparative advantage; and 
w o r k closely w i t h the Bank and other donors to un lock h i ther to un-disbursed donor grant f inanc ing 
fo r key projects and programs in the sub-region. 
The Heads agreed o n the need t o re f ine the ir development agenda, p r io r i t iz ing those areas needing 
more urgent attention wh i le incorpora t ing specific outcome indicators and mon i torab le benchmarks. They 
also concurred w i t h Bank management that g iven high debt levels, add i t iona l IBRD lend ing w o u l d exacerbate 
already t igh t fiscal positions and that, wherever possible, concessional resources f r om other donors shou ld be 
dovetailed w i t h the Bank’s well-respected ana ly t ica l w o r k and technical assistance, and IDA financing. 
115. G iven l im i ted resources and weak ins t i tu t iona l capacity, the Bank proposed a number o f ways to 
strengthen coord ina t ion and to take steps to expedite harmon iza t ion efforts. The Bank also discussed a 
number o f measures to simplify procedures wh ich are small-state unfriendly and to take steps to enhance 
capacity building efforts in government, beginning at the pro jec t implementation leve l . This proposed 
approach was echoed in the area o f AAA, where there was general agreement that more “just-in-time” 
analytical wo rk wou ld help to support the ir re fo rm agenda as a complement to diagnostic work .

1 16. Re f lec t ing the challenges l a i d out during the meeting, the lessons learned f r om the previous CAS and 
building o n thematic and sectoral areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage, Bank ac t iv i t ies w i l l be 
guided by three ma in pr inc ip les : 
(i) supporting reg iona l integration and coord ina t ion efforts; 

28 

11 7. 

11 8. 

(ii) partnering and harmonization in bo th lending and analytical wo rk w i t h other development partners; 
and 
(iii) active pursuit o f s imp l i f ica t ion and capacity building in i t ia t ives ta i lored to these small states. 
Specifically, the Bank wou ld seek to strengthen i t s ro le vis-&vis other donor agencies by increasing 
co l labora t ion on convergent sectors o f interest, as i s currently be ing p i lo ted w i t h DFID in the area o f 
education and the EU o n education and IC T . In a s im i lar vein, the Bank wou ld build o n the broad dialogue o n 
s tab i l iza t ion and structural re fo rm measures that took place in Dom in ica in 2004-05; the extensive amount o f 
economic and sector wo rk conducted by the Bank and other donors; and the EU’s expressed interest in 
ma r ry ing t h e EU’s significant concessional resources w i t h Bank technical expertise and l igh ter operational 
procedures. T o p i l o t this approach, a Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Fund wou ld be established to prov ide EU 
complementary f inanc ing to Dom in ica for a re fo rm agenda supported by a PRSC, w i t h a v iew to extending 
th is moda l i ty to other countries in the reg ion i f successful. 
In an e f for t to encourage coord ina t ion and foster transparency around donor activities in the sub- 
region, the Bank w i l l continue to develop and share tools to facilitate in fo rma t ion o n a id f lows . The RedBook 
On l ine--a web-based e-resource for track ing a id f lows and sectoral and thematic know ledge--wh ich was 
designed in co l labora t ion w i t h UNDP , has recently b e e n shared, in a p i l o t form, w i t h donors and w i l l be ro l led 
out to OECS clients in early 2006, complementing the C l ien t Connections track ing system wh ich was 
delivered in late 2004. 
In a continued e f fo r t to simplify and streamline procedures, and to ensu re that e f f ic iency gains in 
pro jec t design and management are achieved, the Bank has proposed a p i l o t o f a S imp l i f ied Coun try Umb re l la 
Program (SCUP - see box 7) in the OECS. 
120. Responding to pervasive weaknesses in the project implementation u n i t s , and in an e f for t to 
ra t iona l ize and harmonize the ex is t ing dup l ica t ive functions undertaken by mu l t ip le m in is tr ies w i t h i n single 
countries, t h e Bank w i l l deliver an intensive tra in ing program in t h e areas o f procurement, f inanc ia l 
management, and project management. The OECS Capacity Building Program w i l l be delivered to bo th 
Project Management Unit s ta f f wo rk ing o n ongo ing projects and to s ta f f w i t h i n l i n e ministries. The Central 
Tender Boards, wh ich have oversight o n their respective country’s procurement, w i l l also bene f i t f r om th is 
tra in ing . 
121. Given capacity constraints w i t h i n these sma l l states and the need to reach a broader range o f 
stakeholders, the Bank w i l l pursue approaches that closely engage reg iona l and na t iona l agencies and actors. 
The recent example o f workshops, focus groups and pub l ic op in ion p o l l i n g used fo r the preparation o f an 
OECS Pub l ic Sector Transformation strategy, undertaken w i t h the OECS Secretariat and the ECCB, i s a 
mode l that the Bank plans to fo l low fo r other AAA activities.

Investment/TA p rog ram wou ld be a reg iona l 
benchmark ing and regulatory assistance project fo r the water and e lec tr ic i ty sectors, building o n the 
successful establishment o f ECTEL , the OECS regional telecommunications regulator, and the nearly- 
completed PPIAF assistance to Dom in ica that has developed a performance-based regulatory regime to 
replace the cost-plus framework. The project wou ld explore reforms in p r ic ing as w e l l as operation and 
oversight o f e lec tr ic i ty and water companies and wou ld undertake a reg iona l and international benchmarking 
o f the u t i l i t ies w i t h the objective o f increasing e f f ic iency and ra is ing awareness bo th in government and w i t h 
the pub l ic o f the re la t ive performance o f the loca l u t i l i ty . 
127. Env ironmen ta l Management Pro jec t . T o rema in compe t i t ive in the tour ism sector, the OECS 
countries w i l l need to enhance the management o f the ir natural environment. This includes (i) strict 
enforcement o f environmental po l ic ies for land u s e planning, urban-rural zoning regulations and landscaping; 
(ii) conservation and expansion o f natural areas; (iii) mon i to r ing o f the qua l i ty o f coastal waters and beaches; 
and (iv) add i t iona l efforts in so l id waste management, waste water treatment and water and a i r po l lu t ion 
control. Moreover, to reduce vu lnerab i l i ty to natural disasters (under p i l l a r 2 below), measures to reduce 
erosion and promote reforestation are also necessary. T o improve environmental management, the project 
wou ld focus o n po l icy reforms, reg ion-w ide mon i to r ing o f c r i t ica l ecosystems and water quality, reg iona l and 
na t iona l ins t i tu t iona l strengthening, infrastructure investments and increasing pub l ic awareness. Cooperation 
w i t h the p r iva te (tourism) sector and communities w i l l be an in tegra l par t o f the program to participate in 
in terna t iona l environmental cer t i f ica t ion schemes. The pro jec t wou ld use a s imp l i f ied lending instrument, as 
described be low , to enable governments to obtain jus t - in - t ime sma l l Bank loans and poss ib ly grants f r om the 
G loba l Env ironmen t Fac i l i ty and other grant agencies. 

Pillar 2: Reducing Vulnerability 

128. The OECS Governments have signaled the ir interest in par t ic ipa t ing in a C AR ICOM -w i d e 
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pro jec t , ins t i tu t iona l iz ing a comprehensive risk management approach. The 
pro jec t w i l l s tr ive to deepen insurance markets to a l low fo r the improved sharing o f insurable and uninsurable 
r i s k s among the pub l ic sector, pr iva te sector, international insurance industry, international capital markets, 
and the domestic 'self-insured' population. The leveraging o f scarce capital to diversify and better spread 
r i s k s , as well as to s ign i f ican t ly increase the e f f ic iency o f risk transfer mechanisms, wou ld requ ire a sub- 
reg iona l r i s k poo l ing mechanism. The C A R I C OM countries have ind ica ted the ir commitment to increase 
the ir l im i t e d leverage wh i le exp lo i t ing the best terms fo r reinsurance pro tec t ion through shared risk 
d ivers i f ica t ion and faster accumulation o f domestic insurance reserves. The project w i l l be designed to ensure 
that the "productive purposes" test i s satisfied and efforts wou ld be made so that repor t ing mechanisms are in 
place to fully ensure that reconstruction o f productive capacity i s the p r ima ry target fo r such funding under a 
pre-planned risk m i t iga t ion approach, and used to reimburse the government fo r budgets displaced toward 
reconstruction due to emergencies. There i s a precedent fo r the Bank p rov id ing assistance fo r p rem ia v ia 
loans (Turkey Narmara Earthquake reconstruction project), but the proposed Caribbean C R I pro jec t i s c lear ly 
more comp lex g iven the mu l t i -coun t ry and shared risk approach proposed. 
129. W h i l e efforts w i l l be focused o n p romo t ing ex post emergency reliefh-econstruction fac i l i t ies through 
insurance pooling, attention w i l l also be directed towards con t inu ing the dialogue w i t h bo th the Governments 
and the international commun i ty to re in force ex ante vu lne rab i l i ty reduction. 
130. Building o n the recent analytical wo rk undertaken through the OECS o n social pro tec t ion strategies, 
the OECS Soc ia l Pro tec t ion p rog ram wou ld have a two-pronged approach: (i) to scale up commun i ty-dr iven 
micro-projects, targeting the poor and vulnerable segments o f the population; and (ii) t o support 
imp lemen ta t ion o f coun try- leve l reforms, inc lud ing imp rov ing systems fo r mon i to r ing and targeting, and 
ra t iona l iz ing o f ex is t ing social assistance programs under one social find. Reforms at the na t iona l l e v e l 
wou ld be supported in d i f feren t phases under an umbre l la OECS program - St. L u c i a i s expected to be the 
first 
"roll-out" country t o receive assistance, where e f for ts wou ld focus o n strengthening the ins t i tu t iona l 
framework. These efforts w o u l d dove ta i l w i t h the ongo ing wo rk at the C A R I C O M leve l o n re fo rm in such 
areas as social insurance and labor mob i l i ty .

The GEF-funded Ma ins tream ing Adap ta t ion to C l ima te Change p ro jec t seeks to assist in the 
incorpora t ion o f climate change concerns in sector and reg iona l p lann ing fo r the OECS nations and t o identify

o f the OECS countries i s their high levels o f debt and consequent weakened (or lack o f ) creditworthiness. At 
the same time, the social and economic restructuring challenges faced by these small states ca l l for continued 
Bank engagement. This engagement should, however, be contingent on progress in imp rov ing f isca l balances 
and reduc ing debt leve ls . O n this basis, Bank assistance to the OECS over the pe r iod FY06-09 wou ld be 
structured along the fo l low ing (See Table 8): 
An ind ica t ive Base Case lending scenario consisting o f about US$51.3 m i l l i o n in IDA resources34 for 
the four OECS blend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines). 
This number inc ludes the estimated IDA country allocations for each o f the four countries during 
FY06-09, and an IDA Regional a l loca t ion o f $15.2 m i l l i o n fo r two reg iona l projects: US$12 m i l l i o n 
fo r Catastrophe Risk Insurance and US$3.2 m i l l i o n fo r Infrastructure and U t i l i t ies Re form . The 
reg iona l project funds, wh ich a re counted as additional to the ceilings established for country 
allocations, must be matched w i t h one-third o f IDA funds f rom those country  allocation^^^. 
A High Case lending scenario consisting o f an additional US$52.1 m i l l i o n in IBRD investment and 
D P L commitments. 
A L o w Case lend ing scenario consisting o f about US$3 1 m i l l i o n in IDA resources fo r the four OECS 
b lend countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines) inc lud ing the 
reg iona l funds mentioned above.)

133. W h i l e most o f the planned operations wou ld be fo r investment lending, the CAS includes in the base 
case PRSCs fo r Dom in ica and possible IDA - f inanced DPLs fo r Grenada, St. Luc ia and S t . V incen t and the 
Grenadines to enable the Bank to support the early phases o f ambitious stabilization and po l icy re fo rm 
programs i f these countries decide to undertake them. Under the h i g h case lend ing scenario, IBRb - f inanced 
development po l icy lending wou ld be available for these four same countries to pursue p o l i c y re fo rm efforts 
in the areas o f g row th and competitiveness and to St. K i t t s and N e v i s and An t igua and Barbuda (wh ich are 
IBRD on ly) to support them in p o l i c y re fo rm programs to restore f isca l and debt sustainability, and to 
stimulate g row th and improve competitiveness o f their economies. 
134. 
The tw o regional projects-catastrophe risk insurance and the reg iona l Pub l ic U t i l i t i e s Project, wh ich 
wou ld seek to duplicate the successful approach employed to establish the reg iona l regulatory au thor i ty in the 
telecommunications sector, ECTEL -wou ld be prepared fo r simultaneous mu l t i -coun t ry implementation. T h e 
other projects wou ld be prepared and ro l led out to countries on a sequential basis, using an A P L approach 
w i t h those countries most ready and interested go ing f i rs t and others com ing on-stream later during the CAS 
per iod . 

34 In l ine w i t h the IDA 14 agreement (cover ing FY06-08), each country’s IDA a l loca t ion i s determined annually us ing 
the performance based a l loca t ion system. Hence, the a l loca t ion numbers in the C A S are ind ica t ive and f o r p lann ing 
purposes; they cou ld s h i f t as a result o f the annual performance o f a l l IDA borrowers, exchange rate fluctuations o r shifts 
in the size o f the to ta l IDA envelope at the t ime o f annual allocation.

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) 

137. During 2003-2005, the Bank prepared a comprehensive ser ies o f ana ly t ica l s tud ies related to f isca l 
and debt sustainability, g row th and competitiveness, the financial sector, pub l ic sector management and social 
protection. The ongoing dissemination o f these reports represents a key instrument fo r p o l i c y dialogue w i t h 
the OECS Governments on the country’s development pr ior i t ies and the Bank’s assistance strategy, and i s 
intended to build broad ownership for economic and social reforms. 
138. The AAA covered by th is CAS w i l l address issues o f economic g row th and vulnerabilities, and w i l l 
p rov ide valuable inpu t to the po l icy dialogue linked w i t h the lend ing program. New AAA wou ld be o f a 
reg iona l nature to capture economies o f scale in the preparation o f ana ly t ica l studies and to strategically 
support greater sub-regional integration and coordination efforts in the focus areas o f the tw o p i l lars . The 
A4.A w i l l be o f tw o types: formal and in forma l . A b r i e f account o f each study i s prov ided be low . Partnership 
w i t h other donors, inc lud ing the CDB , DFID, C I D A and the EU, in the preparation o f AAA w i l l be sought. 
Discussions w i t h a number o f development partners to this effect are ongo ing to avo id duplication, max im ize 
the use o f available technical and financial resources, and build consensus around c r i t ica l po l icy issues. 
139. An OECS po l icy-no te o n S k i l l s Development and Enhancement w i l l be prepared in F Y 0 6 to examine 
the determinants o f education qua l i ty and relevance, focusing in par t icu lar o n the disconnect between labor 
markets and educational content offered at secondary and post-secondary levels. The broad thrust o f the note 
wou ld be to (i) assess the relevance o f the curricula for general secondary and post-secondary vocational 
education in t h e OECS countries to the needs o f a modern and compe t i t ive economy; (ii) examine the 
po ten t ia l fo r increasing pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships in vocational educa t iodsk i l l training, draw ing f r om 
international bes t practice models (e.g. Malaysia, Colombia, Chile); and (iii) ou t l ine the p o l i c y imp l ica t ions 
fo r shif’ting t h e curren t ly supply-driven, pub l ic ly dominated prov ider system to a more demand-driven system 
w i t h greater p r iva te sector involvement. The findings o f this note wou ld feed in to a Caribbean-wide report o n 
Cu r r icu lum Re fo rm and Qua l i ty Improvement (FY07). 
T o help create a pos i t ive enabling environment fo r pr iva te sector driven growth, FIAS recen t ly 
completed a Diagnostic Rev iew o f the 
Investment C l ima te fo r Grenada wh ich prov ided po l icy 
recommendations as an inpu t to the recently completed study o n g row th and competitiveness issues in the 
OECS. S im i lar analyses for the other OECS countries cou ld be undertaken by FIAS at the request of 
Governments as an inpu t to the ir g row th and competitiveness strategies. An OECS Coun try F iduc iary 
Assessment (CFA) w i l l be undertaken (FY07) to rev iew progress in pub l ic f inanc ia l management and 
procurement re fo rm and to iden t i fy rema in ing issues to be addressed. 
141. Given t h e vulnerabilities of the OECS countries, the Bank w i l l continue the in fo rma l mon i to r ing of 
macroeconomic developments. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue i ts ongo ing support (through the M E C O V I 
IDF grant) and p rov ide additional TA for improved co l lec t ion and analysis o f household survey and pover ty 
data to underpin pover ty reduc t ion and social development strategies. The Bank w i l l also undertake just-in-

CAS per iod and other i s s u e s j o i n t l y identified w i t h the authorities. D issem ina t ion o f key ana ly t ica l wo rk w i l l 
be ensured during the C A S pe r iod to build w ide and strong ownership fo r f i r t h e r structural reforms. In 
addition, the Bank w i l l in tens i fy i ts support in the areas o f project and f inanc ia l management, and

developments in infrastructure, health financing, f inanc ia l sector and regulation. 
Established in 2001 and supported by various donors, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank, the IMF-managed 
Caribbean Techn ica l Assistance Center (CARTAC ) i s a regional resource, based in Barbados, wh ich provides 
technical assistance and tra in ing in four core areas o f economic and financial management at the request o f i ts 
par t ic ipa t ing countries: pub l ic finance management; tadcustoms po l icy and administration; f inanc ia l sector 
regu la t ion and supervision; and economic and financial statistics. The OECS countries have benefited 
s ign i f ican t ly f r om th is program, accounting fo r more than h a l f o f the to ta l t ra in ing offered. The Bank w i l l 
sustain i ts support o f C AR T AC through the FY06-09 period, w i t h an JDF grant o f US$1 m i l l i o n approved in 
FY05 . 

BOX 7: INNOVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SMALL COUNTRIES: 
THE PROPOSED SMALL COUNTRY UMBRELLA PROGRAM (SCUP)36 

The proposed Small Country Umbrella Program (SCUP) has been developed in response to the unique demands o f 
small countries for the Bank to modernize its approach to development and to simplify and accelerate the 
disbursement o f Bank financing. The objective o f the SCUP i s to keep the procedures simple, the fiduciary r i s k s low 
and the processing time below three months. Thus, the projects and activities to be financed under t h i s instrument 
would be relatively small, simple to procure and not trigger complex safeguard measures. 
The model for t h i s new instrument for investment operations for small states would allow countries to borrow small 
amounts (up to U S $ 5 million) for projects through a procedure comparable to obtaining a mortgage loan in the USA. 
Governments would be able to apply for small loans/credits under an umbrella program. I t i s anticipated that once 
the umbrella program has been approved, drill-down operations would be approved o n a non-objection basis or 
through delegated authority to the Regional Vice-president. Allowing the Board to approve the operations on a no- 
objection basis or through similar delegation would greatly speed the process o f resource disbursement. 
There would be two approaches to implementing this umbrella program: (i) through a multi-sector country program 
(i.e. one umbrella program for several sectors in one country); and (ii) through a one-sector multi-country program 
(i.e. one sector in several countries or a simplified horizontal APL). The SCUP operations- defmed by the CAS’ 
objectives- would allow the relevant small country authorities to simplify the application process to finance projects. 

Countries’ e l ib i l i ty for the proposed SCUP would be part o f the CAS envelope detailed in Table 8 and stringently 
linked to the overall lending triggers outlined in Table 9 . 

IFC 

147. 
IFC’s strategy w i l l be to support projects wh ich w i l l enhance the competitiveness o f the OECS 
economies helping them meet the challenges o f globalization, especially trade liberalization, focusing on 
env ironmen ta l ly sustainable business practices and imp rov ing standards o f corporate governance. I F C w i l l 
seek to finance and partner w i t h those companies able to d ive rs i fy the region’s sources o f growth, further 
reg iona l economic in tegra t ion ( inc lud ing w i t h the b igger is land economies such as Barbados, T r in idad and 
Tobago, and Jamaica), and develop linkages w i t h the smaller loca l ly based is land businesses. Some o f the 
sectors o f focus w i l l entail: (i) the f inanc ia l sector (corporate finance, 
f inanc ia l services, insurance) w i t h 
emphasis o n operations w i t h a capacity to mob i l ize fimds f r om t h e larger is land economies and receptive to 
creative approaches to reach out to the smaller loca l ly based business operators (MSMEs); (ii) infrastructure, 
favoring Public-Private Partnerships, together w i t h the Bank, to fac i l i ta te the leveraging o f the larger 
economies to address some o f the key i s s u e s related to power, water and wastewater, transport and logistics; 
(iii) services (IT, tourism) through corporate finance deals by the expansion o f the larger corporations active 
elsewhere in the Caribbean, and seek ing to better leverage the OECS loca t ion and language w i t h respect t o the 
U S market, and w i t h a p r io r i ty to clients interested in deve lop ing linkages w i t h the loca l economy (e.g. tourist 
operators w i t h agro/food processing suppliers); (iv) hea l th and education, no tab ly to address the labor s k i l l s 
shortages, and support the e f fec t ive de l ivery o f hea l th services. Catastrophic risk insurance i s another area o f 
focus where I F C w i l l be wo rk ing together w i t h the Bank.

for further development by senior management. Final adoption w i l l be contingent upon Executive Board approval.

148. G iven the particular issues and constraints faced b y is land economies (cr i t ica l mass, collateral), I F C 
very o f ten cannot finance stand alone projects. This i s especially true fo r tour ism and agribusiness projects, as 
i t i s d i f f icu l t to m i t iga te the commercial risks associated fo r example w i t h stand-alone Greenfield ho te l 
projects, The ava i lab i l i ty o f grant f inanc ing by no tab ly European donors provides an opportunity to develop 
some funding mechanism through wh ich donor monies cou ld be used to share/layer the commercial risk, and 
thereby facilitate IFC ’s financing. The ab i l i ty to structure effective risk sharing structures w i l l be key to 
IFC ’s ab i l i ty to support pr iva te sector development in the OECS countries. 
149. 
I F C w i l l also seek to partner w i t h donors to continue i ts non-investment activities, for example to 
max im ize the impac t o f the SME too lk i t , or t o prov ide the necessary bus iness s k i l l s to MSMEs. Adv isory 
Services i s another I F C product wh ich cou ld assist in addressing some o f the regulatory issues in 
infrastructure, complementing PPIAF support.

150. MIGA’s invo lvemen t in the OECS reg ion has p r ima r i ly been through technical assistance in FDI 
attraction and the agency i s scheduled to undertake a benchmarking exercise in FY06 . MIGA has marketed 
i ts guarantee projects to fore ign investors in the region. Past requests fo r guarantees have been mos t ly related 
to infrastructure investments, although no contract o f guarantee has been signed to date. MIGA w i l l continue 
to rev iew requests at the regional o r country l e v e l s as they arise. Curren t ly the agency does no t have any 
active technical assistance programs. 
15 1. Under the G loba l En te rp r ise Benchmark ing Program, MIGA i s p lann ing t o conduct a benchmarking 
exercise o f the Eastern Caribbean States in FY06 , to be funded by the Commonwea l th Secretariat (Eastern 
Caribbean region), wh ich has comm i t ted and rem i t ted to MIGA a grant con tr ibu t ion o f $75,000. The 
benchmarking exercise w i l l focus o n the investors perspective and w i l l g ive the par t ic ipa t ing countries a 
comparative v iew o f the ir competitiveness vis-a-vis FDI. The recen t ly completed As ia benchmarking study 
prov ides an example (http://www,miga,org/screens/pubsroenchmark/asiareport.pdf) o f the format and depth o f 
analysis. MIGA’s on- l ine investment p romo t ion services (www.fdixchange.com and www.ipanet.net) feature 
over 160 documents o n investment opportunities and the related lega l and regu la tory environment in the 
OECS countries.

F IAS conducted a D iagnos t ic Rev iew o f the Investment C l ima te for Grenada in early 2004 and the re 
i s a poss ib i l i ty i t may undertake s i m i l a r reviews in other OECS countries. 

Managing Risks 

153. As h igh l igh ted in the previous CAS, there are two key external factors wh ich pose the greatest r i s k to 
the successful implementation o f the proposed strategy: (i) na tura l disasters - as ou t l ined earlier, the OECS 
islands rema in vulnerable to weather-related shocks such as hurricanes, trop ica l storms and earthquakes wh ich 
cou ld cause significant damage, as witnessed most recently in Grenada. Wh i le the Catastrophe Risk insurance 
pro jec t seeks to m i t iga te against t h e pub l ic sector po r t ion o f the economic burden f r om such events, there i s a 
risk that a natural catastrophe occurs p r io r to t h e project’s effectiveness thus necessitating additional 
assistance. Weather related shocks also have a sp i l lover effect o n c r i t ica l sectors such as tour ism and 
agriculture; (ii) G iven their strong reliance on the rest o f the world, pa r t icu la r ly fo r commodities (both imports 
and exports) and service industries such as tourism, the sub-region i s susceptible to other external shocks such 
as an increase in o i l prices, interest rate increases or a further expansion o f the tou r ism sector in Cuba and 
other competing destinations. W h i l e d i f f icu l t to mitigate, the strategy seeks to manage these r i s k s through i t s 
m a i n focus on reducing vu lnerab i l i t ies and support fo r economic d ivers i f ica t ion and f isca l prudence. 
154. 
A t the country level, Dom in ica has an ongo ing i s s u e to resolve w i t h regard to an outstanding negative 
pledge. The Government has taken significant s teps to c la r i fy and resolve the situation. The l i e n over 
Dominica’s pub l ic assets has l im i t e d impac t o n IBRD debt servicing. The Bank believes that this issue can be 
resolved satisfactorily. 

155. W i t h i n the OECS sub-region i tse l f , a ma jo r risk i s the po ten t ia l deterioration o f the macro situation, 
wh ich cou ld be po ten t ia l ly tr iggered in the event o f any number o f exogenous shocks as ou t l ined above, or in 
the case o f po l icy slippage. The continued build up o f imbalances cou ld impose d i f f icu l t ies for the 
management o f the currency un ion , wh ich has i t s cornerstone in f isca l d isc ip l ine . The triggers fo r the 
proposed CAS lending re f lec t the need fo r res tor ing f isca l balances and reduc ing debt to sustainable levels. 
The high debt l e v e l s necessitate t h e leveraging o f concessional funding to the extent possible and IBRD 

39 

lending i s on ly envisaged after satisfactory progress has been made to improve f isca l and debt sustainability. 
In essence, h a l f o f the po ten t ia l new pipeline in the high case lend ing scenario hinges upon addressing t h i s 
lack o f creditworthiness. 
156. A h r t h e r po ten t ia l risk l i e s in the region’s weak capacity to subordinate na t iona l sovereignty interests 
to reg iona l pr ior i t ies . The benefits o f mu l t i-coun try approaches can on ly accrue i f there i s po l i t ica l w i l l to 
empower reg iona l ins t i tu t ions . S im i lar ly , the lack o f Government commitment to enact social and economic 
transformations tha t these small economies requ i re to a changing external environment also presents a 
challenge. There i s a risk that OECS countries w i l l opt out o f a Bank assistance strategy altogether and turn to 
other sources o f support. The rigorous triggers, wh i le sending a strong message o f “ongoing support under 
re formed circumstances”, may render the Bank’s assistance po l i t ica l ly unpalatable fo r some countries, wh ich 
wou ld have an impac t o n the reg iona l projects be ing proposed. A sustained program o f communications, 
dialogue, and empowerment o f change agents in the reg ion w i l l help m i t iga te these r i s k s . 
F ina l ly , at the l e v e l o f project implementation, w i thou t a comprehensive tra in ing and knowledge 
sharing effort, the development effectiveness o f the proposed projects w i l l be hampered by the current weak 
capacity in a l l areas o f project management. The proposed OECS Capacity Building Program w i l l address 
these weaknesses.

In t roduc t ion 
1. 

The CAS Comp le t ion Repor t (CCR) reviews the experience in imp lemen t ing the Bank’s Coun try 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region, wh ich was presented to the Boa rd in June 
2001 and covered t h e per iod Ju ly 2001 to June 2006. Barbados was inc luded in th is CAS exceptionally to 
a l low the country t o participate in a Bank-supported program o f HIV/AIDS preven t ion and con tro l across in 
the Caribbean region. The focus o f this Report i s on the f i v e OECS bo r row ing member countries - 
Dom in ica , Grenada, St. Lucia, S t . K i t t s and Nevis, and St. V incen t and the Grenadines. The other OECS 
Bank member, An t igua and Barbuda, has never borrowed f rom the Bank although recently i t has expressed 
an interest in the Bank’s assistance. O f these, Dominica, Grenada, St. Luc ia and St. V incen t and the 
Grenadines are IDNIBRD (50:50) blend countries. 
The CCR reflects, to a large extent, the OECS Coun try Program Qua l i ty Enhancement Rev iew 
completed by the Bank’s Qua l i ty Assurance Group (QAG) Panel in December 2004. The Panel rev iewed 17 
lend ing  operation^^^, inc lud ing tw o on-going operations f r om the previous CAS, and eight A A A s ~ ~ The 
Panel rev iew covered 75 percent o f the 20 projects approved under the current CAS . The reviews were 
fo l lowed b y extensive in terv iews o f Bank s ta f f and management; government o f f ic ia ls and other stakeholders 
as w e l l as key donor representatives. 
This CCR concludes that wh i le the Bank has contributed on ly about 10 percent o f to ta l 
disbursements to the OECS sub-region, i t s contributions were significant to the sub-region’s development. 
Specifically, the greatest impact has been achieved in interventions invo lv ing p o l i c y reforms as was the case 
fo r the Dom in ica ERSO and E C T E L projects. The ERSO sought to restore f isca l balance and encourage a 
resump t ion o f growth, and was approved in response to emerging coun try needs; the E C T E L pro jec t--wh ich 
was an ongoing project f rom the last CAS-was 
successful in d isman t l ing a c r ipp l ing telecommunications 
monopo ly and established a regu la tory framework, lead ing to improved services and lowe r prices. In the 
area o f AAA, the Bank’s ana ly t ica l r igo r and po l icy advice are also w ide ly acknowledged as u s e f u l by key 
stakeholders across the sub-region, although i t was suggested that shorter, more t ime ly p o l i c y notes wou ld be 
more appreciated because o f capacity constraints in the OECS, and because o f the need fo r more timely 
analysis. 
This Report i s organized as fo l lows . Section A reviews the OECS’ development goals and their 
re la t ion to the Bank CAS objectives. Section B rev iews CAS outcomes to the extent that available data and 
other in fo rma t ion perm i t . Section C reviews Bank’s performance in de l ive r ing this assistance, inc lud ing an 
analysis o f po r t fo l io performance. Section D discusses consultation and coord ina t ion w i t h other donors. 
Section E summarizes the lessons learned to i n f o rm the preparation o f the new CAS . Annex 1 contains the 
CAS Results Summary Ma t r ix , Annexes 2 and 3 prov ide in fo rma t ion o n planned and non-programmed 
projects and AAA services and actual deliveries respectively.

38 The 17 lending operations consisted o f two OECS-wide projects (telecom reform and protected areas and associated iivelihood), 
one in Dominica (emergency recovery project), four in Grenada (H IV IA IDS prevention and control, education development, disaster 
risk management, and emergency recovery), three i n St. K i t t s and Nevis (H IV /A IDS prevention and control, education, and 
emergency recovery), f ive in St. Luc ia (water sector reform, disaster risk management 11, emergency recovery, education and poverty 
reduction fund), and two i n St. Vincent and the Grenadines (disaster risk management and economic recovery).

OECS’ Development Goals and Bank CAS Objectives 

A. 
5 . 

The 2001-2006 Bank CAS fo r the Eastem Caribbean benefited f rom the ar t icu la t ion o f long- term 
development objectives, formulated by the two key sub-regional organizations, the OECS Secretariat and the 
ECCB . Building o n their wo rPO - -wh ich had fo l lowed a participatory process over an 18-month pe r iod 
invo lv ing the Governments, parliaments, the private sector, c i v i l society groups, the media, donors and other 
stakeholders in a l l OECS countries--the Bank developed i ts assistance strategy, i tse l f emp loy ing an extensive 
consultative approach to underscore country ownership. Other inputs to the development o f the CAS 
inc luded the coun try Medium Te rm Economic Strategy Papers, the Sma l l States Task Force Report, and a 
broad range o f ana ly t ica l wo rk undertaken for the 1998 and 2000 CGCED meetings. The emergent CAS 
sought to build o n these consultations and to avo id dup l ica t ion w i t h other planned o r ongo ing efforts by other 
development partners: i t sought to focus o n areas o f Bank expertise and comparative advantage 
Aligning i tse l f w i t h sub-regional development goals, the Bank’s CAS fo r the Eastern Caribbean had 
two p i l lars : (i) to support reduced income insecurity and vu lnerab i l i ty at the aggregate and household leve ls ; 
and (ii) to support building human and ins t i tu t iona l capacity. The s ix key OECS’ development objectives 
(country goals), iden t i f ied in the CAS, are juxtaposed w i t h the CAS objectives in Tab le 1. 

6. 

B. CAS Outcomes 
7 . 

Ne i ther the CAS no r the OECS’ development objectives made an exp l ic i t link to the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), bu t the objectives overlapped w i t h MDG targets. Overall, the social indicators 
in the OECS are strong and almost a l l o f the ma jor MDGs have been met. Nevertheless, the impressive 
social development gains made in the past 30 years now risk be ing eroded by the current challenging fiscal 
and debt situations (see be low) and by the economic transformation that may be requ ired to adapt to the 
changing extemal environment. S i g n s o f the erosion are already emerging in the shape o f rising pover ty in 
bo th ru ra l and urban areas, disenfranchised you th and high unemployment, and a corresponding increase in 
crime. 

40 T h e document prepared b y the OECS Secretariat and the ECCB that informed the 2001 CAS was further revised and the OECS 
member states ra t i f ied i t as the OECS Development Charter i n October 2002.

8 . 

The OECS sub-region made substantial progress towards achieving a number o f key goals, despite 
the fact that, during the pe r iod o f the last CAS, economic indicators have deteriorated and a l l s ix countries 
( inc lud ing An t igua and Barbuda) are among the top f i f teen o f the world’s most indebted emerging market 
countries in re la t ion to the ir respective GDP. This conclusion i s based o n reviews o f CAS outcomes and 
their l i k e l y impact o n the OECS’ development goals: 
0 To suppor t the OECS goa l of enhanced economic coopera t ion and macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , the CAS 
focused on fos ter ing a favorab le macroeconomic environment. 
In the CAS, direct operations to achieve the s tab i l i ty and g row th objectives were few, However, the 
o 
Bank responded in a t ime ly and appropriate manner to support the sub-region in cop ing and 
adjusting w i t h external shocks in t h e early 2000s. In particular, prev ious ly unplanned Emergency 
Recovery Projects (ERP) (Dominica, Grenada, St. K i t t s and Nev is , St. Lucia, S t . V incen t and the 
Grenadines) were approved in FY02 to he lp the sub-region cope w i t h higher security concerns and 
the impact o f the reversal in tour ism fo l low ing the events o f September 11 2001. The Dom in ica 
ERP closed w i t h satisfactory ratings and the other four w i l l close at the end o f 2005. These other 
projects curren t ly have satisfactory ratings fo r the two development effectiveness indicators - 
achievement o f development objectives and imp lemen ta t ion progress. In addition, 
t h e Bank 
delivered two other prev ious ly unplanned operations to meet emergency needs in the OECS - the 
Dom in ica ERSO in FY04 and the Grenada Hurr icane I v a n emergency recovery in FY05. 
No tewo r thy in the f i rs t instance was the Bank’s par t ic ipa t ion w i t h other mu l t i la tera l and key b i la tera l 
agencies in p o l i c y dialogue and support fo r structural re forms in Dominica, a t ime ly bu t p rev ious ly 
unplanned Bank response to c l ien t needs. In the case o f the support prov ided to Grenada, funding 
was available in a Contingent Fac i l i ty o f the o r ig ina l disaster risk management projects (see below). 
F ina l ly , the Bank provided, as planned, a water sector technical assistance loan in FY02 to St. Luc ia 

44 

and proceeded w i t h the preparation o f a fo l low -up operation in FY05 t o introduce pr iva te sector 
par t ic ipa t ion and to address c r i t ica l water sector needs in the country. 
In terms o f outcomes, macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ( f isca l de f ic i t and debt ratios) worsened during the 
period. A deteriorating trend was exacerbated in the early 2000s by a number o f negative external 
shocks (natural disasters, the 9/11 events, the s lowdown in the g loba l economy, o i l pr ice increases 
and eroding trade preferences). The OECS governments sought to offset the s lowdown and sustain 
employment as w e l l as meet the f inanc ing requirements through expansionary f isca l policies, ma in ly 
financed through increased pub l ic investments funded w i t h domestic and external bo r row ing on 
commerc ia l terms. The large f isca l and debt imbalances are now further dampening g row th and 
p r iva te investment. 
A l though some countries are exercising 
increased f isca l discipline, 
comprehensive adjustment po l ic ies w i t h a mu l t i- face ted approach to address the excessive debt 
overhang wou ld need to be taken. In Dominica, the Government i s already imp lemen t ing such a 
strategy w i t h support f rom the Bank, the other mu l t i la tera l organizations and b i la tera l agencies. In 
Grenada, the authorities have recently announced plans fo r a comprehensive debt restructuring 
package. An t igua and Barbuda has announced an ambitious f isca l re fo rm agenda inc lud ing c i v i l 
service retrenchments and the re in troduc t ion o f a personal income tax; and St. K i t t s and Nev is has 
announced the closure o f the sugar state-owned company wh ich w i l l ease f isca l pressure. 
In particular, the rea l GDP g row th in the OECS was -1.5 percent in 2001. The economy rebounded 
t h e nex t years to 0.7, 3.4, and 3.2 percent during 2002-2004. Together with a g loba l up tu rn in 
economic growth, the economies o f the OECS are projected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2005. Also, 
the overa l l fiscal de f ic i t has improved f rom 10.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a de f ic i t o f 4.9 in 2004, 
w i t h a projected de f ic i t o f 7.1 percent in 2005. Despite gains in terms o f restoration o f growth, debt 
continued to r i s e as a result o f expansionary f isca l policies. The current pace o f f isca l consolidation 
has been insu f f ic ien t to reverse the massive buildup o f pub l ic debt (reachmg 106 percent o f GDP at 
end-2004 compared w i t h 83 percent in 2000). 
Over the course o f the CAS period, the Bank produced a wea l th o f AAA, much o f i t pan-Caribbean 
in nature, in add i t ion to a number o f bo th sub-regional and country-specific studies. No tab le among 
these was the FY05 OECS g row th and competitiveness study, “Towards a N e w Agenda fo r G row th ” 
wh ich was broad ly disseminated across the reg ion t o a w ide and diverse range o f stakeholders. This 
wo rk has already fostered a dialogue around po ten t ia l new sources o f g row th in the sub-region and 
key factors supporting g row th have been re f lec ted in the new CAS . Other donors, no tab ly the 
European Un ion , have already expressed an interest in using a number o f the recommendations o f 
th is study as the basis fo r EU programm ing in the sub-region. A Caribbean Econom ic Overv iew was 
produced and presented in FY02 to the last CGCED organized by the Bank (responsibility fo r this 
event has since been transferred to the CDB , wh ich has renamed i t the Caribbean Forum for 
Development (CFD)). A D iagnos t ic Rev iew o f the Investment C l ima te fo r Grenada was completed 
jus t p r io r to the devastation o f Hurr icane Ivan . In addition, a l l five planned pub l ic expenditure 
rev iews were completed during FY04 and FY05, albeit w i t h delays to t h e anticipated schedule. 
These documents are r i c h in analysis and the authorities cou ld b e n e f i t f r om the analysis at a t ime o f 
emerging macroeconomic imbalance and should u s e these reports as an input fo r widespread 
discussion on po l icy options go ing forward. 
Overall, although i t i s d i f f icu l t t o measure in any tangible way the outcome o f AAA services in any 
precise way, the Q A G Panel men t ioned earlier no ted the Bank’s ana ly t ica l wo rk occupies a special 
leadership pos i t ion in the OECS countries because the governments’ o w n ana ly t ica l capacity i s 
l im i ted , and because most donors also tend to re ly heav i ly o n t h e Bank . K e y stakeholders shared the 
v iew w i t h the Q A G Panel that the Bank’s AAA services a re supportive o f the p o l i c y dialogue w i t h 
the countries and p rov ide a u s e f u l inpu t in to the po l icy agenda. 
The objectives focus ing o n vu lne rab i l i ty measures were no t fully achieved in the current CAS pe r iod 
bu t are expected to be achieved in the nex t CAS period. The Bank approved an IDF grant in FY02 
fo r the OECS -MECOV I as Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion to a sub-regional in i t ia t ive , Support Program for 
Pover ty Assessment and Reduc t ion fo r the Caribbean (SPARC). I t became e f fec t ive in early FY2004 
and agreed ana ly t ica l wo rk i s under way inc lud ing a t ra in ing workshop in April 2005 o n l i v i n g

45 

o 

K i t t s and Nevis and St. Luc ia were not undertaken. Grenada and St. V incen t and the Grenadines 
pover ty assessments were to be undertaken in FY06 . In order to avo id unnecessary dup l ica t ion and 
to promo te donor coordination, the Bank took the decision to support hav ing C D B take the lead on 
pover ty assessment wo rk w i t h f inanc ia l support f rom DFID. 
0 To support the tw in OECS development objectives of (i) increasing p r iva te sector-led economic grow th 
and d ive rs i jka t ion and ( i i ) reducing vu lnerab i l i ty to na tura l phenomena, the CAS focused on support for 
economic diversiJication: 
o The J inanc ia l sector objective o f a jo in t Bank-Fund FSAP was achieved in FY04 . The report 
h igh l igh ted a number o f emerging risks, inc lud ing the impac t that central government f isca l 
pressures a re likely to have o n indigenous banks. Several o f these banks are highly exposed to the ir 
loca l pub l ic sector, and the rap id build-up in government borrow ings in some countries, combined 
w i t h sizable domestic arrears by these governments, raises a key concern that, i f the current situation 
continues o r deteriorates, the central bank may be called upon to meet a l iqu id i ty need attributable to 
government arrears. W h i l e the central bank handles monetary po l icy , pruden t ia l regu la t ion and 
market development, the f isca l po l icy i s set by countries independently. The central bank has revised 
i ts pruden t ia l guidelines on capital adequacy, risk-based supervision, and corporate governance 
standards in l i n e w i t h some o f the recommendations o f the FSAP report. Other areas o f the report 
w i l l need to be enacted by the ind iv idua l governments, inc lud ing u n i f o rm bank ing law and 
supervision o f off-shore banks. A l though the f inanc ia l sector strengthening loan, programmed for 
FY05 , has no t materialized, in fo rma l po l icy dialogue continues w i t h central bank o f f ic ia ls and i s 
centered o n FSAP findings. 
The infrastructure objectives were substantially achieved in telecommunication and progress in other 
areas are expected in the next CAS period. Testament to the success o f the f i r s t project, wh ich 
established the wo r ld 's f i r s t reg iona l telcommunications regulatory agency, a fo l low -on pro jec t was 
approved in FY05 . The f irs t project helped l ibera l ize the sector, increasing ne two rk capacity and 
compe t i t ion among operators. As a result, telecommunication density increased s ign i f ican t ly and 
caused prices to drop fo r most services. Fo r example, average prices fo r calls f r om the reg ion to the 
Un i ted States have been reduced by more than 70 percent since the start o f the l ibera l iza t ion process. 
This f isca l year, the Water Sector Reform pro jec t has produced a sector law, sector investment 
program, and a PSD strategy that w i l l lead to the region's f i r s t pub l ic-pr iva te partnership in water. 
T o buttress the upcom ing transaction, the Bank also passed a Water Supply Infrastructure 
Improvement Project. The investments w i l l double the o f f- take f r om the nation's ma in water supply 
source to re l ieve water shortages throughout the no r th o f S t . Luc ia . 
S im i lar ly , w i t h Bank support, Dom in ica i s ac t ive ly pursuing an e lec tr ic i ty sector re fo rm program to 
imp rove the regu la tory environment. The full extent o f these reforms cou ld be scaled up 
s ign i f ican t ly by ro l l ing - them out to the other countries in a manner s im i lar to that adopted fo r 
telecommunication regulation. 
The environmental management objectives o f consolidating legal, ins t i tu t iona l , and regulatory 
frameworks in the OECS have no t been achieved. The environment study, wh ich was u l t ima te ly 
refocused as a study o n env ironmen ta l ly sustainable tourism, was completed in FY05 , one year later 
than o r ig ina l ly planned. T h e ana ly t ica l report was discussed w i t h the governments and w ide ly 
disseminated to other key stakeholders inc lud ing hoteliers, cruise-ship operators and environmental 
NGOs . I t i s expected that the report's findings w i l l i n f o rm future support in environmental 
management. In addition, the GEF project o n protected areas was also approved in FY05 bu t has 
on ly just started disbursements. Given the importance o f tou r ism in the sub-region -- accounting for 
29 percent o f GDP, 39 percent o f employment and 54 percent o f export earnings -- the Bank needs to 
rema in engaged in the area o f environmental management. 
The disaster r isk management objectives have been substantially met, a l though the catastrophe risk 
insurance project, wh ich was p lanned fo r FY03 , did no t ma ter ia l ize because o f the lack o f a c r i t ica l 
mass o f par t ic ipa t ing countries at the time. The Bank de l ivered t w o disaster risk management 
projects: in St. V incen t and t h e Grenadines, as p lanned in FY02 , and in St. L u c i a in FY04 , two years 
ahead o f the o r ig ina l plan. Grenada already had a pro jec t on-go ing in 2001. Overall, a l l three 
projects under imp lemen ta t ion have satisfactory development effectiveness indicators and are

examples o f good practice bo th in terms o f technical expertise the Bank can p rov ide as w e l l as the 
close accompaniment by Bank s ta f f dur ing implementation 
to p rov ide support to weak 
imp lemen ta t ion units in the countries. During the recent devastation by Hurr icane I v a n in Grenada, 
the on ly t w o secondary schools o n the is land that withstood i t s impact were bo th b u i l t under this 
pro jec t , Given the recent natural disasters ( inc lud ing hurricanes, earthquakes and trop ica l storms, 
there i s n ow renewed in te res t across the w ider Caribbean, inc lud ing the OECS, fo r a catastrophe risk 
insurance program, and the Bank has been asked by C A R I C OM to take the lead in preparing such a 
mu l t i -coun t ry operation . A l l Caribbean countries are also expected to benefit f rom the GEF pro jec t 
o n adaptation to climate change, approved in FY03 , and s t i l l in i ts early stages o f implementation. 
In the ag r icu l tu ra l diversiJication objectives the Bank did no t participate d irec t ly as FA0 and EU 
have taken the lead in this area. The Bank has, however, continued to rema in engaged w i t h clients 
and donors on those areas re la t ing to agricultural diversification, par t icu lar ly the area o f social 
pro tec t ion . 
0 To support the tw in OECS’ development goals of 
( i ) human cap i ta l development and ( i i ) addressing 
pressing soc ia l issues, the CAS focus was to foster human development: 
o 
The education sector objectives o f bu i ld ing on previous projects have no t been fully achieved bu t are 
expected t o be achieved dur ing the next CAS period. The Bank delivered, on time, three education 
projects (Grenada, St. K i t t s and Nev is and St. Luc ia) in FY03 , and, w i t h a one year delay, in St. 
V incen t and the Grenadines (FY04). The programmed education project fo r Dom in ica did no t 
ma ter ia l ize as the coun try focused instead o n stabilization and structural adjustments w i t h support 
f r om the Bank and others. The education projects were developed and ro l led out as par t o f a 
ho r izon ta l APL. A l l four approved projects are expected to achieve their development objectives but 
progress in implementation o f the St. Luc ia and St. K i t t s and Nev is projects has been ma rg ina l ly 
satisfactory. Disbursements have been par t icu lar ly l o w given that the average age o f the projects i s 
2.5 years. As o f July 2005, disbursements were 6 percent in St. Luc ia , 7.5 percent in Grenada, 22 
percent in St. K i t t s and Nevis, and 5 percent in St. V incen t and the Grenadines wh ich i s the youngest 
pro jec t in the education po r t fo l io hav ing on ly become e f fec t ive recently. The l o w disbursement 
reflects the fact that in Grenada, St. Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines, DFID i s f inanc ing 
bo th curr icu la re fo rm and bid preparation fo r c i v i l works; w i t h Bank support focused ma in ly o n the 
latter. W i t h the DFID project nearly completed, imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank components are 
expected to accelerate and become satisfactory. T o expedite progress o n implementation and the 
achievement o f development objectives at th is c r i t ica l time, the team has moved f r om s ix-mon th ly to 
three mon th ly schedules for implementation missions. In t h e case o f Grenada, a ma jo r setback was 
due to the devastation o f Hurricane I v a n and the pro jec t has been re too led to address reconstruction 
needs. 
The St. V incen t and Grenadine project has benefited f r om an exchange o f in fo rma t ion w i t h St. L u c i a 
and St. K i t t s and Nev is project management units. F o r th is pro jec t also, the Bank collaborated and 
coordinated w i t h a l l other donors to discover that there had been uncoordinated duplications and 
remed ia l ac t ion i s be ing taken to better centralize a l l donor education interventions under one 
common un i t . The mode l o f a central pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion un i t w i t h a separate pro jec t 
coord ina t ing unit in t h e Finance M i n i s t r y fo r a l l W o r l d Bank projects i s being p i lo ted in St. V incen t

s im i lar approach i s being implemented in Grenada, and the European U n i o n has recently opted to 
channel i ts funding fo r the education sector through a Mu l t i -Dono r Bank-administered Trust Fund. 
In the area o f AAA, the Bank produced a repor t o n mon i to r ing educational achievement in the 
Caribbean in FY03 , and i ts findings in fo rmed pro jec t designs in the education sector. The Bank has 
also been the lead donor in spearheading the in i t ia t ive to enhance s k i l l s through distance leam ing 
through the establishment o f the Caribbean Know ledge and Learn ing Ne two rk (CKLN ) . 
The health sector objectives are in the process o f be ing achieved. W i t h the exception o f Dom in ica 
for reasons mentioned earlier, the Bank approved HIV/AIDS projects in the other four countries. 
Grenada and S t . Kitts and Nev is were approved in FY03 , one year later than o r ig ina l ly planned. The 
St. Luc ia and S t . V incen t and the Grenadines projects were approved in FY05 . The projects were 
ro l led out as part o f t h e Caribbean hor izon ta l A P L for HIV/AIDS. The outcomes o f the projects are

again too soon to gauge since they are mos t ly at the early stages o f implementation. As o f July 2005, 
the Grenada and St. Kitts and N e v i s projects are rated unsatisfactory fo r the two development 
effectiveness indicators. The two projects in St. Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines are rated 
as satisfactory. Disbursement rates range f r om 0.3 percent in St. Luc ia to 6.5 percent in S t . Kitts and 
Nevis. 
o The soc ia l sector objectives rema in unachieved bu t this i s d i f f icu l t to ascertain given the 
unava i lab i l i ty o f t ime ly and comparable data o n pover ty incidences across the sub-region. An IDF 
grant o n imp rov ing social statistics (MECOV I ) was approved in F Y 0 2 and became e f fec t ive in 
FY04 . W h i l e i ts implementation has been slow, the grant i s expected to lead to better social statistics 
when i t i s completed in two years time. The Caribbean M E C O V I i s a mu l t i-donor e f for t to make 
social data available in the fu tu re . Currently, the estimate i s that a third o f the poo r households 
rema in chron ica l ly poor; the others do no t receive satisfactory incomes. S im i lar ly , pover ty estimates 
range f r om 12 percent o f the popu la t ion o f An t igua and Barbuda, to 25 percent o f that o f St. Lucia, 
to 31 percent o f that o f St. Kitts and Nevis, 32 percent o f that o f Grenada, 3 3 percent o f that o f 
Dom in ica , and 3 8 percent o f that o f St. V incen t and the Grenadines. Pover ty i s prevalent in the ru ra l 
and agr icu l tura l areas and i ts incidence i s higher among the youth, female-headed households, and 
larger fam i l ies . I t i s significantly linked t o the unemployed and to those w i t h l o w educational s k i l l s . 
In t e rm s o f AAA services, the Bank delivered a Caribbean w ide you th and social development in 
FY02 , bu t this did no t lead to any project due to lack o f commitment f r om countries to borrow for 
such interventions. In addition, the Bank also produced a social pro tec t ion strategy fo r Dom in ica in 
F Y 0 4 to prov ide inpu t in to the PRSP the Government i s preparing. The other planned study on 
social pro tec t ion and social safety net mechanisms fo r the OECS w i l l be delivered as a w ider 
Caribbean AAA in early FY06 . M o r e impor tan t ly , although t h e Bank intended to undertake pover ty 
assessments in a l l five bo r row ing member countries, when i t discovered subsequent to the CAS 
approval that the C D B and DFID were j o i n t l y undertaking these assessments in the OECS, i t 
supported CDB ’s tak ing t h e analytical lead. The St. Luc ia Pover ty Reduc t ion Fund closed 
successfully recently and the authorities have expressed an interest to continue w i t h a next phase 
operation. 
0 To support OECS’ development objective of bu i ld ing greater organ iza t iona l capac ig , the CAS focus was 
on fos ter ing ins t i tu t iona l development: 
o The pub l ic sector management objectives have no t been achieved, a l though s ign i f ican t progress has 
been made in Dom in ica since the Emergency Recovery Support Operation (ERSO) was approved in 
FY04 . This operation, wh ich was no t planned, i s another example o f a Bank response to emerging 
c l ien t needs and has been rated as satisfactory in terms o f the t w o development effectiveness 
indicators. The Ins t i tu t iona l and Organizational Capacity Rev iew was completed in FY03 , one year 
later than o r ig ina l ly planned, bu t the five planned pub l ic sector re fo rm operations planned fo r F Y 0 4 
have yet to materialize. Renewed interest, however, spearheaded by the Government o f Grenada, 
has meant that the Bank i s wo rk ing towards preparing and approving these operations under the nex t 
CAS . T o ensure a home-grown pub l ic sector transformation agenda, the Bank has been wo rk ing 
closely w i t h sub-regional change agents--led by the ECCB - to foster development o f the re fo rm 
agenda. The Bank also delivered tw o other U s
 re-alignment o f sub-regional development 
strategy, as planned in FY02 , and country f inanc ia l accountability assessment, as planned in FY03 . 
The p lanned medium te rm economic strategies fo r each country in F Y 0 4 were no t done as t h i s 
respons ib i l i ty was transferred to the C D B as par t o f the broader CFD w o r k program. 
The strategic a id coord ina t ion objective has been pa r t ia l ly achieved bu t i s no longer under the 
leadership o f the Bank. Among the donors, U N D P out o f Barbados has taken the lead in 
coordinating donor activities, bu t in add i t ion the OECS Secretariat now hosts and chairs OECS 
donor meetings once a year. The focus o f these meetings has been o n in forma t ion-shar ing and o n 
the activities o f the Secretariat i tse l f i s o n reg iona l projects as the ind iv idua l governments have

projects at risk (75 percent. In FY05 , this situation improved and the H I V / A I D s projects now account for 
two o f the three projects at risk. Limited disbursements to date, can in part, be explained by the composition 
o f the projects, o f wh ich approximately 65 percent o f commitments are large-scale infrastructure 
components, wh ich have l e s s o f an impact on development outcomes o f the projects. Deficiencies in the 
Na t iona l Tender Boa rd processes have proven to be a bottlenecP2 to procurement and, hence disbursement, 
especially fo r these infrastructure components. The other ‘software’ components o f the projects, wh ich focus 
o n qua l i ty and capacity are progressing we l l , but account for a much smaller po r t ion o f commitments and as 
such are no t necessarily reflected in performance indicators. 
I t i s also use fu l to acknowledge that a l l 
H I V / A I D S programs in the reg ion are mov ing s low ly and a j o i n t analysis w i t h DFID has shown very slow 
movement o f the G loba l Fund resources for HIVIAIDS programs. A l though tender board issues are 
essentially beyond t h e Bank’s control, the Bank w i l l continue to seek to remove bottlenecks by fam i l ia r iz ing 
and tra in ing board members to Bank processes and f iduc iary requirements. Disbursement levels are 
expected to be on track w i t h i n 12 to 15 months. In addition, the C M U i s undertaking a Caribbean Region- 
w ide H I V / A I D S Rev iew o f the ind iv idua l projects and programs against their o r ig ina l objectives, look ing at 
programs available f r om b i la tera l and other mu l t i- la tera l partners: the objective i s to arrive at a coordinated 
approach to tack l ing systemic issues w i t h i n this area. 
Another reason - and a manifestation o f l im i ted available ins t i tu t iona l capacity - fo r implementation 
delays in education and H I V / A I D S prevention and con tro l projects has been the l o n g delays f r om Boa rd 
approval to effectiveness. O f the projects approved dur ing the CAS period, education and H I V / A I D S 
preven t ion and con tro l projects had a median o f 6.7 months to effectiveness, compared to 4.2 mon th med ian 
fo r infrastructure sector projects. W h i l e these projects also had the highest po l icy -mak ing support, typ ica l ly 
at the l e v e l o f the Pr ime M in is ter , the performance o f project teams needed to build support at the 
stakeholder leve l has been lackluster. During the ro l l -ou t o f the CAS, start-up delays were somewhat 
m i t iga ted in infrastructure sector projects by ensuring certain cr i ter ia were in place p r io r to Boa rd approval, 
inc lud ing : terms o f references for consultants, tender documents fo r works, and requests for quo ta t ion for 
goods bu t much remains to be done. A t tach ing draft procurement and f inanc ia l management plans to the 
Minutes o f Negotiations has, however, helped to further reduce t ime between Board approval and 
effectiveness. 
A CPPR undertaken in November 2003 
h igh l igh ted the f iduc ia ry areas o f procurement and 
financial management as w e l l as implementation 
capacity as ongo ing problems. 
Supervision 
in tens i ty was increased, s ign i f ican t ly fo r education 
and health sector projects and, fo r FY05 , significant improvements have already been seen. 
Despite the p rob lem projects in the current por t fo l io , pro jec t ratings and flags are considered to be 
realistic. Generally there are d i f feren t project flags fo r each pro jec t in each year, ind ica t ing that iden t i f ied 
problems are solved o n a project-by-project basis. Three projects in FY05 ma in ta in project flags43 and last 
f isca l year four o f the projects are rated unsatisfactory. Due to in tens i f ied supervision efforts, however, the 
po r t fo l io has improved. The Bank recen t ly has been wo rk ing w i t h Grenada, St. K i t t s and Nev is , and St. 
Luc ia to consolidate the ir Project Management Un i ts and Project Imp lemen ta t ion Units in to one Project 
Coord ina t ing Unit per countrqp4, an area h igh l igh ted in two previous CPPRs as a po ten t ia l way to address 
l im i ted imp lemen ta t ion capacity, pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f f inanc ia l management and procurement.

Consultations w i th other donors. The Bank i s the on ly ma jo r donor w i thou t a permanent presence in 
Barbados, where most donors are based. Nevertheless, the Bank has built on i t s good relationship w i t h the 
donor commun i ty through a comb ina t ion o f high l e v e l v is i ts , audio- and video conferencing. As a resu l t , fo r 
example, discussion i s at an advanced stage to establish a Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Fund to be administered by t h e 
Bank in support o f projects and programs in the sub-region. Dom in ica and Grenada are be ing considered for 
p i lo ts . The Bank i s also par t ic ipa t ing in discussions with the Barbados-based donors in order to harmonize 
donor f iduc ia ry and repor t ing requirements fo r Grenada. 
A id coordination. With the evo lu t ion o f the CGCED ’s scope evolved f r om a pledging fo rum to that 
o f a broader development forum, the Bank’s ro le in a id coord ina t ion d im in ished over time. The Bank 
continues, however, to p lay strategic ro le in support o f the OECS, notwithstanding i t s absence f rom 
Barbados, where the ma jo r i ty o f donors are based. When the CGCED was f i r s t established in the 1970s, i t 
was chaired by the Bank and the fo rum was pa r t ia l ly devoted to a id mob i l iza t ion and coordination. Over 
time, a id mob i l iza t ion was no longer relevant but the re used to be coordination among the m a i n donors 
during the CGCED meetings. F r om 2002, the respons ib i l i ty o f organ iz ing and cha ir ing the CGCED has been 
assumed by the CDB , w h i c h hosted the f i r s t meeting o f the renamed Caribbean Fo rum fo r Development 
(CFD), i s scheduled in M a y 2005. 
A l though no longer convening t h e CGCED, the Bank has continued a coordination ro le in a number 
o f areas, as evidenced by three examples: First, in the f i r s t event o f i t s kind, the Bank moved qu ick ly to 
mob i l ize and coordinate donor support fo r Grenada in the aftermath o f Hurricane I v a n in late 2004. An 
i n i t i a l donor meeting at Bank Headquarters brought together Heads o f Development Agencies w i t h the 
Grenadian authorities and t h e reg iona l and sub-regional stakeholders fo r a pre l im inary discussion o n the 
shorter-term reconstruction and longer-term development p r io r i t ies and funding needs. This event was 
fo l lowed by a Government hosted donor conference in Grenada, wh ich raised over US$lOO m i l l ion . Another 
example has b e e n the deepening dialogue between the Bank and key donors, as noted above, to leverage 
donor grant funds in support o f projects and programs developed by the Bank, ma tch ing concessional 
resources w i t h Bank techn ica l expertise. F ina l ly , the Bank has developed, w i t h U N D P support, a Caribbean 
w ide Red B o o k On l ine that provides an internet-based p la t fo rm fo r know ledge sharing and coord ina t ion 
between development partners.

The preceding analysis supports the continued relevance o f the Bank’s par t ic ipa t ion in the sub- 
region. The Bank’s ab i l i ty to leverage other donor grant funds in support o f projects and programs i t 
prepares using the g loba l knowledge and expertise i ts s ta f f possess i s un ique and h igh ly valued by the 
bene f ic iary and donor countries. 
The fo l low ing lessons emerge f r om the implementation o f the last CAS :

0 T h e areas o f C A S focus a n d the adap ta t ion to emerg ing crises in the O E C S , in general, a n d 
p a r t i cu l a r l y in Dom in i c a and G r en ad a w e r e app rop r ia te . T h e m i x o f intervent ions 
supported the objectives genera l ly we l l . The next CAS w i l l need to build o n the lessons 

learned f rom preparing hor izon ta l APLs sequentially and, in particular, shou ld ensure that the 
benefits reaped by the Bank in preparing hor izon ta l A P L s are accrued to the countries. In the 
past CAS, this has been achieved to an extent w i t h the St. V incen t and the Grenadines education 
pro jec t as in fo rma t ion o n c i v i l works des ign and bid contract samples were shared f rom St. Luc ia 
and St. K i t ts and Nev is project management units. In general, however, hor izon ta l A P L s have 
no t reaped the economies o f scale in capacity-building, information-sharing, and technical 
expertise that had o r ig ina l ly been envisaged. This i s in large par t because t h e regional aspects o f 
the APLs have under-performed. 

0 T h e best results w e r e ach ieved w h e n th e B a n k s ta f f closely accompan ied the 
imp lemen ta t ion w i t h coun t ry counterparts , a n d was ab le to exp lo it th e synergies be tween 
w e l l sequenced ana ly t ica l wo rks , w e l l designed operations, a n d to leverage trust funds a n d 

dono r activities. The experience o f disaster risk management projects and the Dom in ica ERSO 
are examples o f pos i t ive outcomes when the projects are very closely accompanied by close 
Bank s ta f f support and supervision. The example o f St. V incen t and the Grenadines education 
pro jec t shows how important i t i s to coordinate w i t h other donors to avo id w a s t e h l duplications. 
The experience o f Grenada, S t . Luc ia and St. V incen t and the Grenadines are that better results 
are achieved when the Bank leverages other donor funds and activities. With a g row ing debt 
overhang in the OECS countries, the next CAS w i l l serve the sub-region w e l l by using IDA 
resources to leverage available donor grants fo r programs designed and implemented with Bank 
expertise.

w o u l d be a s ign if icant step towa rds address ing the p r o b l em o f capac ity weaknesses in the 

sub-region. Common pro jec t coordinating and management units are be ing p i lo ted in St. 
V incen t and the Grenadines and are expected to be the mode l fo l lowed in Grenada. 
I t i s 
anticipated that this w i l l pa r t ly address the perennial shortage o f sk i l led s ta f f and a l low fo r 
greater synerg ies w i t h other donors. S im i lar ly , wo rk o n harmon iza t ion o f f iduc iary and 
repor t ing requirements fo r Grenada’s reconstruction efforts w i l l be watched closely. I f this can 
be achieved, i t wou ld be wo r th rep l ica t ing in the other countries. 

T h e C A S was no t rea l is t ic enough abou t s ta f f a v a i l ab i l i t y a n d p r o g r amm i n g . Several 

interventions programmed in t h e previous CAS were de l ivered one to three years beh ind 
schedule. This was due to a var ie ty o f factors, some beyond the con t ro l o f Bank team members 
o r management. In some cases, par t icu lar ly fo r some ana ly t ica l work, the slippage was due to 
s ta f f ing and resource issues. Greater attention needs to be pa id to the fact that, w i t h i n the Bank, 
sma l l countries no t on ly o f ten have to compete w i t h larger borrowers fo r the attention o f qua l i ty 
staff, but demand considerable ins t i tu t iona l support wh ich i s very costly., Greater attention also 
needs to be pa id to t h e p rov is ion o f customized products fo r sma l l countries, inc lud ing more just- 
in - t ime po l icy notes. The latter wou ld be pa r t icu la r ly valuable to country counterparts who are 
o f ten the sole po in ts o f contact fo r a p le thora o f donors and are stretched extremely t h i n in the 
OECS.

0 T h e C A S did n o t focus enough on inst itut iona l development in the areas o f B a n k f idu c i a r y 

requ i remen ts . Wh i le ind iv idua l project managers delivered tra in ing o n f iduc iary aspects either 
in a coun try o r across country fo r the same project type (e.g., disaster risk management projects), 
capacity building and knowledge-sharing has been thin. Given the d i f f icu l ty o f f ind ing qua l i f ied 
s ta f f and rap id turn-over o f key s ta f f in the country pro jec t units, the Bank should institute a 
more systematic capacity development program in project management fo r the OECS countries 
and, in this regard, should undertake a comprehensive rev iew o f the e f f icacy o f Project 
Management Un i ts to ensure that capacity-building efforts are more broad ly undertaken.

T h e O E C S countr ies themselves did no t def ine th e i r deve lopment objectives w i t h sufficient 
p r io r i t i z a t ion o r w i t h benchma rks capable o f be ing mon i to red , a n d outcome ind icators . 

A l though the OECS Development Charter broad ly charts a way forward, i t has proved too 
general to se rve as an adequate framework fo r e i ther leveraging reg iona l ism o r fac i l i ta t ing donor 
co-ord ina t ion around a set o f agreed priorities. In a se r ies o f meetings w i t h OECS Heads o f 
Government, the ECCB and the OECS Secretariat, i t has n ow been agreed to coordinate donor 
in terven t ion around a clear se t o f pr ior i t ies w i t h attendant benchmarks and timelines. 

D o n o r co-ord inat ion , wh i l e imp rov ing , has been h is to r ica l ly weak , a n d dup l ica t ion o f 

p rog r am s a n d intervent ions a r e common. The reluctance o f OECS Heads o f Government to 
give respons ib i l i ty to the OECS Secretariat for coordinating donor assistance has meant that ad- 
hoc national agendas have continued to undermine the formu la t ion and implementation o f a 
strong reg iona l agenda. Go ing forward, the decision to h o l d an annual h igh - leve l donor meeting 
w i t h the Heads o f Government w i l l facilitate donor co-ordination around agreed programs and 
principles. 

G i v e n the fac t th a t the O E C S countries a r e among th e most h igh l y indeb ted eme rg ing 
economies in th e wo r ld , g rea te r a t ten t ion w i l l need to b e p a i d to the leve rag ing o f ava i lab le 

dono r g r an t resources. The new CAS should explore t h e establishment o f alternative 
mechanisms, poss ib ly Mu l t i -Dono r Trust Funds, par t icu lar ly w i t h EU involvement, to help 
catalyze the considerable amount o f EU grant f inanc ing (committed bu t no t yet disbursed) 
around c r i t ica l OECS pr ior i t ies . Greater attention w i l l also need to be pa id to wo rk ing w i t h the 
IMF to mob i l ize donor and po l i t ica l support for economic re fo rm and adjustment programs, as, 
for example, was successfully undertaken in Dom in ica last year. 

Po l i t i c a l economy issues need special a t ten t ion in sm a l l states. The fact that the planned 

Pub l ic Sector Re fo rm programs did no t u l t ima te ly ma ter ia l ize under the CAS, h igh l igh ts the 
importance o f wo rk ing w i t h governments, donors and c i v i l society o n innova t ive approaches to 
consultation and consensus-building. The recent analytical w o r k o n pub l ic sector re fo rm wh ich 
has inc luded pub l ic op in ion po l l ing , wo rk ing w i t h loca l ly based change agents to build 
consensus, o f fers a mode l fo r the future which, along w i t h more innova t ive dissemination and 
communication strategies, w i l l need to be addressed in the nex t CAS . 

F ina l ly , g rea te r emphasis i s needed on s imp l i f ied ins t rumen ts a n d s imp l i f ied processes t h a t 

address the rea l i t ies of sma l l states. The proposed SCUP wou ld address a number o f the issues 
h igh l igh ted in th is Comp le t ion Report.

B. Recurrent Cost Financing

Overa l l amount o f recurrent

No country leve '

C. Lo c a l Cost Financing 

A re t h e requirements for Bank 
financing o f loca l expenditures met, 
namely 
that: (i) f inanc ing 
requirements fo r the country's 
development program wou ld exceed 
the pub l ic sector's own resources 
(e.g., f r om taxation and other 
revenues) and expected domestic 
borrowing; and (ii) t h e financing o f 
foreign expenditures alone w o u l d not 
enable the Bank to assist in the 
financing o f ind iv idua l projects. 

D. Taxes and Duties 

A r e there any taxes and duties that 
the Bank wou ld no t finance? 

Yes. 

None. 

T h e Bank m a y finance up to 100 percent o f pro jec t costs o f 
ind iv idua l projects, wh ich wou ld also apply to grant financing. 
In most ind iv idua l projects, the Bank expects to continue 
financing less than 100 percent o f project costs. T h e actual 
cost-sharing percentages w o u l d be determined dur ing the 
preparation o f each project. Recurrent cost financing 
associated w i t h Bank operations i s expected to rema in 
re la t ive ly sma l l in countries where the Bank has a lend ing 
program. The Bank w i l l continue to mon i tor t h e fiscal pos i t ion 
and prospects o f each o f the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) 
countries, and i ts imp l ica t ions for recurrent cost financing in 
these countries. In determining Bank financing o f recurrent 
costs in ind iv idua l projects, the Bank w i l l take in to account 
sustainability issues at the sector and pro jec t leve ls , inc lud ing s 
careful consideration o f implied future budgetary outlays. In 
the case o f An t igua and Barbuda, wh ich i s no t currently a B a d 
borrower, should bo r row ing resume at a f u t u r e date, the 
country's f isca l and debt situation and imp l ica t ions for 
recurrent cost financing wou ld also be examined during projecl 
appraisal. 
The tw o requirements fo r Bank financing o f loca l expenditure: 
are met in the Bank bo r row ing countries. 
Therefore, the Bank can finance loca l costs in the proportions 
needed in ind iv idua l projects. In the case o f An t igua and 
Barbuda, should bo r row ing resume at a f u t u r e date, t h e second 
cr i ter ion f o r loca l cost f inanc ing wou ld also be examined durin 
project appraisal. 

Taxes in the OECS countries are ne i ther excessive nor 
discriminatory; therefore, the Bank may finance taxes and 
duties associated with pro jec t expenditures. T h e OECS 
countries are mak ing efforts (work ing w i t h the IMF and 
C AR T AC ) to improve their tax systems, that are generally 
complex, d i f f i c u l t to administer and non transparent. At the 
project-level, the Bank w o u l d consider whether taxes and 
duties constitute an excessively h i g h share o f projects costs. 

' For the purpose o f the country financing parameters, the Organization o f Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) includes six countries: 
Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, S t . Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and S t . Vincent and the Grenadines, the six independent 
countries o f the OECS and a l l members o f the World Bank Group.

APPENDIX 5: OECS CAS CONSULTATIONS 

Background 
The preparation o f t h i s CAS fo l lowed a continuous and detailed dialogue invo lv ing the Governments o f the 
OECS, sub-regional organizations, development partners, and representatives o f c i v i l society. The process 
entailed two rounds o f consultations: ( i ) In January 2005, a meeting was held in St. George’s, Grenada, 
between the s ix OECS Heads o f Government, the Governor o f the ECCB and the Director-General o f the 
OECS Secretariat and a Bank delegation comprised o f the President o f the W o r l d Bank, the V i c e President 
fo r the L A C reg ion and the Coun try Director, Lead Economist and Sector Leaders o f the Caribbean Country 
Management Un i t . IFC’s Reg iona l representative and the Executive D i rec to r fo r the Caribbean were also in 
attendance; (ii) in M a r c h 2005, dur ing in-coun try consultations, the “Concept Note”, wh ich detailed key 
directions for the C A S was presented to Government and NGOs ( inc lud ing the pr iva te sector, c i v i l society 
and other stakeholders). In addition, the CAS preparations benefited f rom an extensive Coun try Program 
Qua l i ty Enhancement Review, conducted by t h e Bank’s Qua l i ty Assurance Group in November 2004, wh ich 
invo lved meetings w i t h stakeholders, inc lud ing Government and Barbados-based donors. F ina l ly , the 
Lessons Learned and new approaches presented are in formed by the CPPR and supervision missions 
conducted over the last two years. 
The consultations in Ma rch 2005 took place as fo l lows : 
Dom in ica : 
A mee t ing organized by the M in is t ry o f Finance, inc lud ing participants representing the pub l ic 
sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the pr iva te sector. 
St. K i t ts and Nevis: 
Meeting organized by the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, inc lud ing approximately a dozen participants 
representing the pub l ic sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the p r iva te sector. 
In addition: a meeting with the Governor o f the ECCB and his senior advisors was held. 
St. Luc ia : 
A meeting, organized by the Bank ’s Pub l ic In fo rma t ion Center, inc luded participants representing 
the pub l ic sector, NGOs, trade organizations, and the pr iva te sector. A later mee t ing w i t h the 
D i rec to r o f Economic A f fa i rs at the Ministry o f Finance was held. 

St. Vincent and the Grenadines: 
Meeting organized by the M i n i s t r y o f Planning, inc lud ing participants representing the pub l ic sector, 
NGOs, trade organizations, and the p r iva te sector. 
Grenada: 
Mee t ing organized by the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, inc lud ing participants representing the pub l ic sector, 
NGOs, trade organizations, and the pr iva te sector. 
Barbados: 
A meeting hosted by UNDP invo lv ing representatives f r om the Caribbean Development Bank, 
C ID A , DFID, the European U n i o n and U S A I D . 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS RECE IVED DURING THE CONSULTATION PROCESS 
The consultations consisted o f a b r i e f presentation by the Bank team, exp la in ing the proposed assistance 
strategy fo r the OECS, inc lud ing lending and non- lend ing ac t iv i t ies by areas o f intervention; and the 
rationale fo r selection of these areas. This was fo l lowed by comments, questions and answers o n the 
proposed strategy as w e l l as o n broader issues and concerns. 
Overall, the thrust and focus o f the proposed C A S was w e l l received by stakeholders. There was engaging 
discussion about the CAS and add i t iona l ly a number o f areas outside o f the C A S ’ scope wh ich stakeholders 
felt should be national a n d o r reg iona l pr ior i t ies . There was, however, a degree o f skepticism about the 
va l id i ty o f the consultations and a sense that inpu t f rom NGOs in par t icu lar was pro- forma rather than a rea l 
input to the country strategic p lann ing process. NGOs impressed upon the Bank team the need for greater 
inc lus ion in project des ign and implementation.

P ro f i le . An t igua and Barbuda i s a three-island economy (Redonda i s the third) wh ich accounts fo r 
about 25 percent o f the combined Eastern Caribbean Currency U n i o n GDP. Antigua, the largest island, has a 
dry c l ima te and a large number o f wh i te sand beaches. The cu l t iva t ion o f sugar that started in the late 1600’s 
was abandoned in 1969. Aside f rom tourism-the 
island’s most important industry-Antigua and Barbuda’s 
economy depends heav i ly o n the service sector, par t icu lar ly offshore services. The unemployment rate i s 
estimated at 7 percent, pover ty i s estimated to be re la t ive ly low , w i t h a headcount index o f 12 percent, but 
social indicators do no t reflect the high per capita income. Adu l t l i teracy attainment, fo r example, lags the 
other OECS countries. The 2004 U N D P Human Development Report ranks An t igua 55*, out o f 174 
countries. 
Po l i t i c a l Context . Independence: 198 1 Nex t election: 2009. 
In M a r c h 2004, the Un i ted Progressive Party w o n a landslide v ic to ry in the general elections, ending the 
po l i t ica l dynasty o f the Bird family, wh ich had dominated the country’s po l i t ics fo r more than h a l f a century 
and run a populist, non-transparent regime, du r ing wh ich there was a severe erosion o f governance and 
po l icy slippage. An t igua and Barbuda i s curren t ly no t a bo r row ing member o f the Bank due to 
creditworthiness issues and i ts high per capita income. I t has, however, benefited f r om economic and sector 
work, and reg iona l analytical wo rk undertaken across the OECS sub-region and the w ider Caribbean region, 
The new administration has recently made overtures to the donor commun i ty ( inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank) for 
assistance in the area o f macroeconomic management. 
Econom ic Deve lopments a n d Prospects. Rap id pr iva te sector-led g row th in the 1980s, ma in ly 
tourism-sector driven, gave way to pub l ic sector-led growth, accompanied by deteriorating ins t i tu t ions and 
broad f isca l mismanagement. As in the other OECS countries, g row th slowed down considerably in recent 
years due to a comb ina t ion o f exogenous shocks (natural disasters, the impact o f the 9/11 events o n tour ism 
and tightened regu la t ion o f offshore activities) and po l icy slippages during t h e two Bird (father and son) 
administrations, inc lud ing f isca l mismanagement and widespread governance issues. The pub l ic sector has 
been used as an employer o f last resort, w i t h the result that about 40 percent o f the labor force i s employed in 
the pub l ic sector and 60 percent o f government revenues go to meet the wage bill, leav ing l i t t l e room for 
other expenditure. The large f isca l deficits 
that resulted were financed through arrears to b o t h external 
creditors as w e l l as domestic banks, suppliers and the social security system. Con t inued bo r row ing f rom 
select institutions, bo th domestic and external, was secured through earmarking tax revenues to pay debt 
service to creditors and through non-transparent loans (at end-2003, almost 35 percent o f revenues were 
estimated to be earmarked fo r debt service). 
G row th has strengthened since 2003 due to a rebound in tourism, bu t f isca l imbalances rema in very large and 
the debt stock i s high. The pub l ic sector debt stock in 2003 was estimated at 142 percent o f GDP (external 
debt at 75 percent o f GDP). An t igua and Barbuda’s debt p ro f i le i s somewhat d i f feren t f r om the other OECS 
countries. Mu l t i la te ra l debt i s negligible and there i s no debt outstanding to the Wo r ld Bank Group. Deb t 
sustainability analysis by the IMF shows that under a passive scenario, w i t h n o adjustment, the pub l ic debt 
wou ld r ise to over 157 percent o f GDP by 2009. However, i t i s un l ike ly that An t igua and Barbuda wou ld 
find the f inanc ing required by th is scenario. A strong f isca l adjustment, as detailed in the attached table, 
wou ld lead to the pub l ic sector debt ra t io to GDP com ing down to 86 percent o f GDP by 2009. However, 
th is adjustment wou ld require p r ima ry s u r p l u s e s during 2007-09 in the range o f 1.5-3.5 percent o f GDP and a 
comprehensive debt restructuring. 
The new administration that took office in M a r c h 2004 has shown comm i tmen t to address the country’s 
problems bu t the challenges are significant. F isca l imbalances and the leve l o f external debt ( inc lud ing 
arrears) are high. The Government announced an ambitious f isca l re fo rm in the 2005 budget, inc lud ing the 
re- in troduc t ion o f a personal income tax (introduced in April 2005)-and of a mode rn system o f proper ty taxes 
(to become effective in January 2006), and measures to cu r ta i l the g row th in expenditures, inc lud ing a 
significant downsizing o f the pub l ic sector, together w i t h the establishment o f an adequate safety net. Also, 
the authorities recently announced in June that a VAT w i l l be in troduced in 2006. At the same time, new

Annex 1: Country Profile 

1. 

Population: 

71,000 (2003) 
GNI Per Capita: US$3,650 (2004 est. Atlas method) 
Profile. Dom in ica , the most northerly and largest o f the W indwa rd Islands, i s predominately a lush 
mountainous area w i t h p len t i fu l water resources, excellent fo r cu l t iva t ing bananas, wh ich together w i t h other 
agr icu l tura l products are the base o f the economy and i ts largest source o f employment. Mainstream tour ism 
was never developed due to the small number o f white-sand beaches, h i g h ra in fa l l and poor a i r connections; 
however, given i ts other natural characteristics, eco-tourism i s being promoted. Ag r icu l tu re i s the mainstay 
o f the economy and accounts for about 18 percent o f GDP, 60 percent o f to ta l merchandise exports and 
employs 40 percent o f the labor force. The unemployment rate i s estimated to be 25 percent, and the pover ty 
head count index i s 33 percent. Dom in ica ranks 95 th out o f 174 countries in UNDP ’s 2002 Human 
Development Index . 
Political Context. Independence: 1978 Nex t Election: before Ju ly 20 10. 
Dom in ica i s the on ly commonwealth member o f the OECS, and the on ly is land w i t h a substantial surviving 
popu la t ion o f indigenous people, the Caribs. In M a y 2005, the Labour Par ty--wh ich had formed a coa l i t ion 
w i t h the more conservative Dom in ica Freedom Party fo l low ing the death o f the former Labour Party P r ime 
M in is te r - -won twe lve o f the twenty-one seats in Parliament, increasing i ts ma jo r i ty by two seats. The current 
Government has continued the d i f f icu l t economic transition begun by the previous administration. 
Economic Development and Challenges. Fo l low ing a contraction o f the economy o f 9 percent in 
2001-03 and a f isca l crisis in 2003, Dom in ica has made significant progress at macroeconomic adjustment 
and fiscal consolidation. Despite an earthquake that struck Dom in ica in late 2004, the rea l GDP g row th rate 
for 2004 i s estimated at 3.5 percent, on the back o f strong performance by the banana sector, manufacturing 
and construction, and resumed market confidence. W i t h resolute implementation o f the stabilization and 
structural adjustment program supported by the IMF under a three-year SDR 7.7 m i l l i o n Pover ty Reduc t ion 
and G row th Fac i l i ty , an IDA adjustment credit (a US$3 m i l l i o n Economic Governance Re fo rm Cred i t 
disbursed as a s ing le tranche in February 2004), and other donors’ technical and f inanc ia l support, the f isca l 
pos i t ion has strengthened considerably. 

2. 

3. 

The conduct o f f isca l po l icy has been prudent, w i t h large savings realized above programmed amounts o n 
account o f stronger than expected revenues. As a result, t h e p r ima ry balance improved f r om -1.6 percent o f 
GDP in FY2002-03 to a s u r p l u s o f 5.6 percent in FY2003-04, and the overa l l f isca l balance improved f r om - 
5.4 percent o f GD P in FY2002-03 to -1.3 percent in FY2003-04, large ly exceeding i ts -4.2 target. The 
FY2004-05 p r ima ry balance and the overa l l f isca l balance a re projected to reach 2.7 percent and -2.5 percent 
o f GDP, respectively. Reforms o f the tax system (through the in troduc t ion o f a VAT), the pub l ic sector, 
financial management and social security are ongoing. The IMF-suppor ted PRGF program remains on-track 
w i t h the third and four th programs successfully completed in February 2005. 

In April 2004, as par t o f i ts macroeconomic program, Dom in ica launched a debt exchange aimed at reduc ing 
debt to a sustainable l e v e l . The debt exchange o f fe r was closed in September 2004. Thus far, agreements (in 
pr inc ip le) have been reached to restructure about 70 percent o f the e l ig ib le debt. The authorities continue to 
make good fa i th efforts to reach understandings w i t h creditors who have no t yet agreed to participate in the 
restructuring, and have comm i t ted to mak ing payments in to escrow accounts o n restructured terms fo r such 
creditors. Debentures have been issued to creditors w i t h f ina l ized agreements and payments under 
restructured terms started. Tak ing in to account the actual terms o f the agreed restructurings and assuming 
that the rema in ing creditors w i l l accept the o f fered terms, the debt ra t io wou ld rema in sustainable. However, 
the debt trajectory i s very sensitive to the assumed economic g row th rate and p r ima ry surplus (detailed in the 
attached table), Furthermore, rising g loba l interest rates present an add i t iona l vu lnerab i l i ty . 

Under the IDA - f inanced Econom ic Governance Re fo rm Credit, the Government implemented actions to (i) 
restore fiscal s tab i l i ty by imp rov ing f inanc ia l and debt management, and (ii) encourage a resumption of 
g row th by strengthening the f inanc ia l sector, imp rov ing the p roduc t iv i ty o f pub l ic investment and imp rov ing 
the climate for pr iva te investment, Government’s re fo rm e f for ts fo r 2005 under the IMF PRGF arrangement 
w i l l focus o n imp rov ing the f isca l framework and pub l ic finances, and strengthening the social security and 
the financial sector. Specific measures inc lude imp rov ing the regu la t ion and oversight o f non-bank f inanc ia l

Popu lat ion: 

105,000 (2003) 
GNI p e r cap i ta : US$3,760 (2004 est. Atlas methodology) 
P ro f i le . Grenada, wh ich includes the two smaller islands o f Carriacou and Pe t i t Mar t in ique , to i ts 
north, i s the southernmost o f the W indwa rd Islands. Dubbed the “Spice Island”, Grenada was, until late 
2004, the wor ld ’s second largest exporter o f nutmeg and mace. O n September 7,2004, Hurr icane I v a n - o n e 
o f the strongest storms ever to s t r ike the Caribbean region-passed d irec t ly over Grenada, decimating the 
hous ing stock, severely damaging the nutmeg plantations and in f l ic t ing significant damage o n the tou r ism 
sector. An Organization o f Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Secretariat assessment team estimated the 
damage at US$900 m i l l ion , more than 200 percent o f the 2003 GDP, two thirds o f wh ich was housing stock. 
Unemp loymen t rates and poverty levels, already among the highest in the OECS, are expected to worsen as a 
result. P r io r to Hurr icane Ivan, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 13 percent, and Grenada was 
ranked 93rd o n UNDP ’s Human Development Index out o f 174 countries. 
Po l i t i c a l Context . Independence: 1974 Last election: 2003 
F o l l ow i n g the Ma rx is t m i l i ta ry coup and subsequent U S invas ion in 1983, power has fluctuated regu lar ly 
between the N e w Na t iona l Party and N ew Democratic Party, w i t h the former w inn ing the ma jo r i ty o f seats 
during the most recent three terms, albeit by a s ign i f ican t ly reduced ma rg in (one seat ma jo r i ty ) in the most 
recent elections. 
Econom ic Deve lopments a n d Prospects. P r io r to Hurr icane Ivan , the economy was recovering 
f r om the 2001 -02 down turn that affected a l l the OECS countries and progress was tak ing place in addressing 
f isca l imbalances and offshore f inanc ia l sector weaknesses. Aided b y the recovering economy, the central 
government p r ima ry balance improved f rom a de f ic i t o f -14.5 percent o f GDP in 2002 to a s u r p l u s o f 0.4 and 
3.7 percent o f GDP in 2003 and 2004, respectively. This was achieved by broadening the tax base, cu r ta i l ing 
tax and impo r t du ty exemptions and con t ro l l ing expenditures. Pub l ic debt had increased in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, no tab ly in 2002 ow ing to the purchase o f leases associated w i t h pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships 
and the gran t ing o f guarantees. No tw i ths tand ing the f isca l adjustment in 2003-04, to ta l pub l ic debt at end- 
2004 increased to 129 o f GDP. 
F o l l ow i n g Hurr icane Ivan, the near-term economic ou t look i s very d i f f icu l t . The economy contracted by 3 
percent in 2004 and i s expected to expand by on ly 1 percent in 2005’, w i t h depressed conditions in tou r ism 
and agriculture nearly o f fse t t ing the stimulus f r om the construction sector. 
In f la t ion has remained low , 
no tw i ths tand ing large increases in inpu t prices such as construction materials. The external current account 
de f ic i t i s expected to deteriorate sharply in 2005 (to 34 percent o f GDP), as a result o f the sharp increase in 
reconstruction-related impor ts and s low recovery o f exports. Social conditions, already weaker than in other 
OECS countries, deteriorated after Hurr icane I v a n w i t h about 8 percent o f the labor force displaced f r om 
the ir jobs in the immediate aftermath o f the hurricane. 
In the f isca l area, w i t h support from the in terna t iona l commun i ty , the authorities were able t o close the 2004 
financing gap. Non-essential expenditures were reduced, donor pledges o f U S $ l 5 0 m i l l i o n (34 percent o f 
2004 GDP) were mob i l ized qu ick ly at a donors conference held in October 2004 and a fo l low -up fo rma l 
p ledg ing session in November 2004. An Agency fo r Reconstruction and Development was established in 
November 2004 to coordinate domestic and in terna t iona l e f for ts to rebu i ld Grenada. Grenada also accessed 
t h e IMF’s emergency assistance fo r na tura l disasters (US$4.4 m i l l ion ) in November 2004. The W o r l d Bank 
reallocated US$ lO m i l l i o n from ex is t ing projects to address reconstruction needs, and a firther loan o f 
US$10 m i l l i o n (IDNIBRD) f r om t h e OECS Disaster Management Project Contingency Fac i l i ty was 
provided. 

The 2005 budget, approved in April, includes revenue-enhancing measures y ie ld ing over 2 percent o f GDP. 
Yet, the fiscal situation remains cha l leng ing and f inanc ing gaps fo r 2005 and beyond remain. Post-hurricane 
re l ie f and rehab i l i ta t ion expenditures are required, revenues sources rema in weak and the high debt l e v e l s 
require setting t igh t l im i ts to further borrow ing . The f isca l de f ic i t i s expected t o reach 8.5 percent o f GD P in 

Estimates and projections included in this and fo l low ing paragraphs and in attached tables do no t take in to account the impact of 
Hurricane Em i l y which passed over Grenada on July 14,2005. An assessment o f the damage i s underway b y the OECS Secretariat 
( in i t ia l tentative estimates o f the damage were placed at US$107 m i l l ion , o r about 24 percent o f GDP, b y the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, 

91 

2005 (and the p r ima ry balance -2.5 percent o f GDP) and, despite the Government’s revenue e f for t and 
exceptional donor support, a f inanc ing gap estimated at about 4.5 percent o f GDP remains fo r 2005 due to 
high reconstruction expenditures, and o f 12-14 percent o f GDP per year between 2006 and 2009. In t h e 
absence o f debt restructuring, pub l ic debt wou ld continue to r ise , reaching near ly 144 percent o f GDP by 
2009 and pub l ic debt service wou ld range between 32 and 42 percent o f revenue in 2005-09. 

F o r 2006 and beyond, the f inanc ing gaps cou ld be f i l led through f isca l adjustment, cooperative debt 
res truc tur ing agreements and donor support. Fiscal adjustment measures cou ld inc lude imp lemen t ing 
pe tro leum pr ice reform, reducing tax concessions and imp rov ing tax collection; and containing the g row th o f 
non-interest current spending and capital expenditure pr ior i t iza t ion . Deb t sustainability analysis by the IMF 
shows that a comb ina t ion o f f isca l adjustment (w i th a pr imary f isca l surplus reached by 2008 and maintained 
thereafter), a comprehensive debt restructuring in 2005 and additional fore ign grants wou ld reduce the pub l ic 
debt to GDP ra t io gradually (to 100 percent by 2009 and be low 50 percent by 2020) and make the debt 
service burden more manageable (10 to 1 8 percent o f GDP) (see attached table). Even under this scenario, 
the economy wou ld rema in vulnerable and pub l ic debt high fo r many years to come. In particular, the 
comb ina t ion o f high debt, susceptibility to external (economic and natural) shocks and a tour ism dependent 
economy po in ts to an unusually high l e v e l o f risk. 

The authorities recognize that a comprehensive medium-term economic program i s needed to fill f inanc ing 
gaps, restore debt sustainability and ensure medium-term g row th and p lan to design i t w i t h the support o f 
C AR T AC . Already, the authorities are designing a pub l ic sector modern iza t ion program, w i t h assistance 
f r om the W o r l d Bank, to enhance pub l ic sector e f f ic iency and produc t iv i ty , inc lud ing through the 
commerc ia l iza t ion o f pub l ic services and imp rov ing the procurement system. With respect to debt 
management, in October 2004, Grenada announced that i ts debt was unsustainable and that i t planned to 
pursue a cooperative so lu t ion w i t h i t s creditors. Because interest payments o n tw o large international bonds 
were missed in late December, Grenada was downgraded to “selective default’’ by Standard and Poor’s, In 
January 2005, the Government hired lega l and f inanc ia l advisors to help in the preparation o f a 
comprehensive debt reduction strategy. Pending the development and outcome o f the strategy, Grenada has 
discontinued servicing most commercial and o f f ic ia l b i la tera l debt obligations. In April 2005, a creditor 
committee representing a ma jo r i ty o f the country’s commercial debt obligations was formed. A debt 
exchange o f fer to commercial creditors i s expected to be launched in the com ing months. The Government 
has also approached o f f ic ia l creditors to negotiate debt and debt-service r e l i e f o n at least comparable terms. 
Deb t restructuring w i t h b i la tera l creditors i s complicated b y the severance o f d ip loma t ic relationship between 
Grenada and i ts largest creditor, Taiwan, China. A successful outcome o f the debt strategy, wh ich i s 
curren t ly being developed, cou ld considerably narrow the f inanc ing gaps.

L u c i a the biggest exporter o f ag r icu l tu ra l products among the OECS member countries. T h e pleasant c l ima te 
and the sandy beaches have encouraged the development o f tourism, pa r t icu la r ly in the “honeymoon sector” 
w h i c h has become the m a i n fo re ign exchange earner in the economy. Desp i te re la t ive ly s trong social

resu l t ing in worsen ing p r im a r y balances ( f r om 0.2 percent o f GD P in FY 2 0 0 0 / 0 1 t o -5.1 percent in 
FY2002 /03 ) and rising p u b l i c sector debt ( f r om 44 percent o f GD P in 2000 t o 6 4 percen t in 2002).

T h e economy rebounded in FY2003 /04 and FY2004 /05 , w i t h a g r ow t h ra te o f 3.1 and 3.7 percent, 
respectively, sustained by s trong per formance in the tou r ism sector. There was s ign i f ican t f isca l t igh ten ing 
in FY2003 /04 resulting in a p r im a r y balance o f -1.0 percent o f GDP, due t o h i g h e r revenue collection, 
reduced cap i ta l expenditure and a p i c k - u p in economic ac t iv i ty . Howeve r , the p r im a r y d e f i c i t i s estimated t o 
have deteriorated s l igh t ly in FY2004 /05 (-1.3 percent o f GDP), due t o rising cap i ta l expenditure. W h i l e the 
lowes t in the OECS, in 2004 p u b l i c debt stood at 73 percent o f GDP. E x t em a l debt represents 63 percent o f 
to ta l debt. T h e Governmen t has been able t o access the reg iona l cap i ta l marke ts o n increas ing ly favorab le

However , a con t inua t ion o f curren t f isca l po l ic ies w o u l d lead to a n unsustainable l e v e l o f debt, and c rowd -

Econom ic Developments a n d Prospects. L i k e the other OECS countries, the coun t ry experienced 
a n economic g r ow t h s lowdown in the la te 1990s and ear ly 2000s. W h i l e t rad i t iona l ly among the mos t 
fiscally responsible o f the OECS countries, the authorities began in the la te 1990s t o imp lemen t expansionary 
f isca l po l ic ies t o o f fse t the econom ic s lowdown . As a result, the f isca l s i tua t ion weakened since the late 
1990s, and p u b l i c debt has r i s e n r a p i d l y since 1999, ye t rema ins l ow e r than the OECS average. This was 
compounded by the cost o f rehab i l i ta t ion expenditures t o repa ir damage caused by a series o f weather- 
induced na tura l disasters. P u b l i c debt rose f r om less than 50 percent o f G D P in 1997 t o 79 percent o f GD P in 
2004 ( o f w h i c h 32.5 percent i s domestic and 67.5 percent i s external; about 35 percent o f p u b l i c debt i s t o 
comme rc ia l banks). This increase was in large par t due t o the past adm in is tra t ion 's guarantee and, in 1999, 
assumption o f a large p r iva te ex terna l debt o f EC$156 m i l l i o n (17.5 percent o f GDP) f o r the cons truc t ion o f

Econom ic a c t i v i t y rebounded in 2003 and 2004 as a resu l t o f a r e v i v a l o f tourism, w i th rea l GD P g r ow t h o f 
3.4 and 4.3 percent respectively. A modest acceleration (4.9 percent) i s expected in 2005 o n the basis o f 
con t inued expans ion in t o u r i sm and tour ism-re la ted services, a n increase in p u b l i c sector inves tmen t and a 
high l e v e l o f cons truc t ion ac t iv i ty . U n l i k e ne ighbo r ing Grenada, there was l im i t e d damage f r om Hu r r icane 
I v a n (about 5 percen t o f 2003 GDP), In fact, Grenada's demand f o r food, cons t ruc t ion materials and 
transport services has boosted econom ic a c t i v i t y in St. V incen t and the Grenadines. 
A f te r a s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in 2003, f isca l per formance weakened in 2004 as a resu l t o f slower revenue
