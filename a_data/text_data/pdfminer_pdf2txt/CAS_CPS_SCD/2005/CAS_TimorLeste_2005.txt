EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Timor-Leste, the wo r ld ’s newest nation, was created out of ashes. In 1999 the popu la t ion 
vo ted o v e rw h e lm i n g l y f o r the res to ra t ion o f independence f r o m Indonesia, but the ou tcome o f 
the re fe rendum was me t w i t h an orchestrated campaign o f violence and des t ruc t ion in w h i c h 
m o r e than a thousand people los t the i r l ives and the coun t ry ’s in f ras t ruc tu re was l e f t in ruins. An 
estimated 70 percent o f p r iva te homes and p u b l i c buildings were bu rned t o the g round . B r idges 
and p ow e r l ines were demolished, and the telecommunications system was rende red inoperable. 
Va luab le f i les , i n c l u d i n g l a n d and p rope r ty titles, c i v i l registry, and education records were 
destroyed. F o l l o w i n g the ba l lo t , mos t Indonesian citizens l e f t the te r r i to ry , resu l t ing in a severe 
shortage o f q u a l i f i e d and experienced professionals, T h e coun t ry was l e f t w i t h o n l y t w o powe r 
engineers, 2 0 percent o f i t s secondary school teachers, 23 med ica l doctors o f w h i c h one surgeon, 
and n o t a s ing le q u a l i f i e d pharmacist. 

2. 
Given that the country started f rom scratch both physically and institutionally, T imo r - 
Les te has done remarkably we l l . M a j o r steps have been taken t o build the na t ion , and the 
coun t ry has ma in ta ined peace and p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty . F ree and f a i r elections were h e l d and a 
Cons t i tu t ion adopted, w i t h almost a l l the ins t i tu t ions i t mandated n ow created. A N a t i o n a l 
Deve lopmen t P lan (NDP), a S tab i l i ty P rog ram (SP), and Sector Inves tmen t Programs (S IPS )

B a n k and In te rna t iona l M o n e t a r y Fund Boa rds as a Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy. Since the 
res to ra t ion o f independence, the Gove rnmen t has focused squarely o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
NDP and SP. T h e Government has adopted a lega l f ramewo rk f o r pe t ro leum p roduc t ion , 
taxation, and revenue management that i s considered in te rna t iona l best-practice and i s consistent

na t ion ’s pe r fo rmance has been cons ide rab ly better than that o f other pos t -con f l ic t countries. 

3. 
Yet Timor-Leste i s at a cross-road, and progress remains f rag i le . Es tab l ish ing a w e l l - 
f u n c t i o n i n g state w i l l take years, i f n o t decades. T h e coun t ry has made great strides in a short 
time, but m u c h remains t o be done. T imo r -Les te i s among the wo r ld ’s poorest countries, and lags 
b e h i n d the reg ion in ach iev ing the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals. W h i l e pe t ro leum p roduc t ion 
and associated Gove rnmen t revenue have r isen rap id ly , non -pe t ro leum p roduc t ion , f u e l l e d b y a

has mos t l i k e l y increased. Unemp loymen t in u rban areas i s high, especially f o r you th . T h e 
p r iva te sector faces fo rm idab le constraints, and farmers are o n l y s l ow l y ad jus t ing t o the

4. 

Over the past f i v e years, strong partnership w i th donors around a whole-of-Govemment, 
results-oriented framework f i rm l y anchored in the NDP and the SP has been key to T imo r - 

L e s t e ’ s successful nation-building process. Desp i te be ing a sma l l f inanc ia l con t r ibu to r , the B a n k 
has p layed a cen t ra l r o l e b y assisting the Government in f o r g i n g these partnerships. Acco rd ing ly , 
the Bank ’s business m o d e l has evo lved around coordination, sustained b y ana ly t ica l and 
adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA) and mu l t i -dono r grant funds, rather than lend ing . T h e backbone o f this 
approach has been the T rans i t ion Support P rog ram (TSP), n ow k n o w n as the Conso l ida t ion 
Support P rog ram (CSP), a budge t support operation f inanced b y t e n partners and supported b y 
several others as observers. T h e TSP/CSP has focused o n an annual, cross-Government results 
m a t r i x and has been the p r i n c i p a l instrument f o r p o l i c y dialogue between the Gove rnmen t and i t s 
development partners. T h e Gove rnmen t has praised this ins t rumen t f o r respecting ownership, 
building capacity in p r i o r i t i z i n g interventions, sharing lessons f r o m across the wo r ld , e x p l o i t i n g 
the synergies among development partners, and p r o v i d i n g a f r am ew o r k f o r in te rna t iona l 
accountability. 

5 . 

The Bank aims to support Timor-Leste in consolidating its early progress, and moving 
f rom a focus on post-conflict issues to creating the conditions fo r g row th outside the petroleum 

sector and f o r poverty reduction. T o achieve this, the three-year C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy 
(CAS ) w i l l support the NDP and SP objectives o f de l ive r ing sustainable services, c rea t ing 
p roduc t ive employment, and strengthening governance, w h i l e ma ins t ream ing gender and you th 
across these three strategic p i l la rs . T a k i n g i n t o account the lessons learned, the C A S adopts f o u r 
p r inc ip les o f engagement: building ins t i tu t iona l capacity, deepening the results orientation, 
strengthening transparency and commun ica t ion , and conso l ida t ing and ex tend ing the strong 

in te rna t iona l partnerships. The CAS presents a results framework around the three strategic 
p i l la rs , which w i l l be sustained through partnership w i th a host of donors, not jus t Bank 

interventions. The results f ramewo rk w i l l b e translated annua l ly i n t o a results m a t r i x f o r

considers them achievable g iven the comm i tmen t o f the Gove rnmen t and the strength o f 
partnerships. 

6. 

To achieve the proposed results, the Bank G roup w i l l deploy a m ix of multi-sector and 

sector grants and AAA. T h e annual, single-tranche, m u l t i - d o n o r CSP w i l l unde rp in the three-

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presents the Wo r ld Bank’s strategy f o r T imo r - 
Les te f o r FY06-FY08. I t i s the first full CAS f o r T imo r -Les te , f o l l ow i n g the 2000 T rans i t ion 
Suppo r t Strategy (TSS ) . The B a n k began t o prepare the CAS in 2003 but, at the request o f the 
Gove rnmen t , postponed i t s f ina l iza t ion pend ing the comp le t ion o f the Gove rnmen t ’s Sector 
Inves tmen t Programs (SIPS). I n l i n e w i t h the strong partnerships that have been fo rged among 
the Gove rnmen t and donors, this CAS has been agreed b y a l l development partners and the 
Gove rnmen t . I t represents n o t just the Bank ’s e f fo r ts , but the w ide r e f fo r ts o f Gove rnmen t and a l l 
donors, wha t i s k n o w n as the “who le -o f -Gove rnmen t approach.” This re fe rs t o the h i g h l y 
co l labo ra t ive w a y in w h i c h na t ion building has been pursued in the wo r ld ’s newest coun t ry . 

2. 
The CAS incorporates a three-year results ma t r ix . A CAS Progress Repo r t w i l l be 
p repa red in FY07. The three-year t ime f rame o f the CAS covers the rema inde r o f the current

B. Governance 

10. 

There has been significant progress in the creation of the architecture of governance and 
the associated legal and institutional frameworks. T imo r -Les te 's Cons t i tu t ion p rov ides f o r 

separation o f powers, essential checks and balances, and safeguards o f c i t izens rights. At the 
restoration o f independence, the organs o f the State, i n c l u d i n g the Execu t ive , Parliament, 
Judiciary, and, pa r t icu la r ly , the O f f i c e o f the President, ex is ted no t iona l ly , but in some instances 
w i t h o u t the appropriate lega l f ramewo rk , staff, o r even o f f ices and equipment. Since the 
res to ra t ion o f independence, the Gove rnmen t has comp le ted p o l i c y and leg is la t ion f o r these 
entities and endowed them w i t h human resources as w e l l as phys ica l in f ras t ruc tu re . Gu ided b y a 
w e e k l y C o u n c i l o f M i n i s t e r s meeting, the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion has g radua l ly gained capacity, 
a lbe i t w i t h uneven results across sectors. Adm in is t ra t ions w i t h representatives f r o m some 
m in is t r ies have been established in each o f the 13 districts, and the 65 sub-districts have been 
assigned a sub -d is t r ic t adm in is t ra to r and an economic and social deve lopmen t o f f ice r . 

11. 

Steps are being taken to provide fo r the effective checks and balances foreseen in the 

Constitution. The Execu t ive i s the strongest a rm o f the State and needs t o exercise care in 
exe r t ing i t s powe r w i t h respect t o the independence o f o the r state ins t i tu t ions and the media. 
Pa r l iamen t i s g radua l ly enhanc ing i t s a b i l i t y t o oversee the w o r k o f Gove rnmen t . T h e jus t ice 
sector has been hampered by inexpe r ienced s ta f f and weak systems, lead ing t o an u nw i e l d y

func t ions o f human rights comm iss ione r , ombudsman, and a n t i - c o m p t i o n agency, i s about t o

The functioning of both the private and the pub l ic sectors i s impeded by the extremely 

12. 
low l e v e l s of education and professional experience. O n l y 50 percent o f adults are literate, w h i l e 
less than one - th i rd o f adults have some secondary education. T h e l a c k o f capacity i s re f lec t ive o f 
b o t h the re la t ive ly l o w leve ls o f s k i l l s and experience achieved in T imo r -Les te under the 
Indones ian adm in is t ra t ion and the weaknesses o f in te rna t iona l capac i ty -bu i ld ing e f fo r ts . U n d e r

Co r rup t ion i s an area of growing concern. A l t h o u g h n o systematic surveys have been 
ca r r ied ou t to ascertain h ow widespread the p r o b l em i s , co r rup t ion i s pe rce ived b y the T imo rese 
p u b l i c t o be a serious and g r ow i n g p rob lem . Cases o f co r rup t ion have emerged, pa r t icu la r ly in 
procurement, customs, the jus t ice system, and the p r iva te sector. T h e O f f i c e o f the Inspec to r 
General has ac t ive ly pursued a p rog ram o f investigations since i t s establishment in 2000,

have been promulgated, but e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion w i l l demand fu r the r regu la t ion and a 
p roac t ive campa ign o f i n f o rm a t i o n and education. 

14. While the incidence of co r rup t ion may be increasing, there i s also s ign i fcan t and 

growing demand f o r good governance. There i s widespread awareness o f the effects o f p o o r 
governance, pa r t icu la r ly co r rup t ion , based o n experience unde r the Indones ian adm in is t ra t ion . 
Med ia , c i v i l society, and Pa r l iamen t have a l l become outspoken o n governance issues and have 
displayed keen interest in safeguarding pe t ro leum revenues. Associacao HAK has p u b l i c i z e d 
cases o f co r rup t ion in the jus t ice sector. During the budge t r e v i ew in 2004, members o f 
Parliament vo iced the i r dissatisfaction w i t h a r e v i ew process that was deemed too short and that 
does n o t a l l ow dialogue w i t h l i n e M in is te rs . Professional g roup ings have also begun t o act t o 
protect professional and p u b l i c interests. In 2004, lawye rs l o d g e d a comp la in t rega rd ing the l a c k

Box 2: Ensuring Prudent Governance o f Petroleum Revenues 
Over the nex t few decades, T imo r -Les te stands to ga in s ign i f ican t o i l and gas revenues, i n c l u d i n g over U S D

imp lemen ta t ion o f the NDP , i t poses an impo r tan t set o f governance challenges. In te rna t iona l experience suggests 
that countries r i c h in na tura l resources are pa r t icu la r ly susceptible to was te fu l spending and corrup t ion , as 
evidenced b y consistently lowe r per formance in g row th and pover ty reduc t ion than in resource-poor nations. 
I n response to this challenge, T imo r -Les te i s po ised to adopt arrangements fo r pruden t management o f 
pe tro leum revenues fo r the bene f i t o f curren t and fu ture generations. B u i l d i n g upon the successful N o rw e g i a n 
model, the Government has developed a savings p o l i c y and d ra f t Pe tro leum Fund A c t l a y i n g ou t a f ramewo rk f o r

arrangements are consistent w i t h p r inc ip les o f in terna t iona l good practice: 
a) 
A savings po l icy has been adopted to preserve the rea l value o f pe tro leum wea l th b y spreading

The MPF has conduc ted a study o n budget execu t ion processes and causes o f spending

cash in provision of commitments that have been made but not spent du r ing the course of the f isca l year. Under the transitory savings po l icy , t h e 
Government allocated only royalties and the corresponding investment income to oil/gas savings, wh i le petroleum tax revenues were channeled 
to the budget. Given unusually h igh petroleum prices, this resulted in the accumulation of 
large central government cash balances in FY05. 
Together w i th the in te r im o i l lgas savings f rom royalties, these a re expected to be largely transferred to the Petroleum Fund once i t is

I n order to eflectively p l a n combined sources spending and shift a greater p ropo r t ion on 
budget, the Govemment has asked development partners to support such a shift by continuing 
whole-of-Government budget support f o r three more years. C F E T spending (Tab le 1) accounts 
f o r less than 50 percent o f the so-called C om b i n e d Sources Budget, w h i c h amounted t o about 
USD 200 m i l l i o n in FY05. C om b i n e d sources spending inc ludes several o f f -budge t sources: the 
undisbursed balance o f TFET, b i la te ra l dono r funding, and UN assistance (F igu re 2). M a n y o f 
the b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l programs encompass expenditures that constitute core government 
func t ions and are u l t im a t e l y long - te rm l iab i l i t ies , such as pharmaceuticals, educational materials, 
and maintenance. S h i f t i n g these expenditures o n budget w i l l a l l ow the Gove rnmen t t o address

I V . LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE 

42. 

The Bank’s early engagement in Timor-Leste has yielded a multitude of information and 
lessons fo r its w o r k in post-conflict countries. The experience in T imo r -Les te has he lped t o shape 

the Bank’s-and 
the deve lopmen t commun i ty ’s - th ink ing 
o n approaches in pos t -con f l ic t and 
f rag i le states. W h i l e lessons o f experience are s t i l l be ing learned, this section h igh l igh ts some o f 
the successes a n d fa i lu res , w h i c h are equa l ly valuable in gu id ing the Bank ’s strategy go ing 
fo rwa rd . 

A. Strong Partnerships for a Whole-of-Government, Results-Oriented Approach 

F rom the outset, strong strategic partnerships were forged. I n the f a l l o f 1999 , a Joint 

43. 
Assessment M i s s i o n (JAM) was fielded, w h i c h comp r ised equal numbers o f T imo rese leaders 
and representatives f r o m f i v e b i la te ra l donor countries, the European Comm iss ion (EC), UN 
agencies, the ADB, and the W o r l d Bank . T h e J A M i d e n t i f i e d p r i o r i t y recons t ruc t ion objectives 
across sectors and p r o v i d e d estimates o f external f inanc ing needs. As a result, TFET was 
established in Decembe r 1999. Guided b y the April 2000 T S S , this mu l t i -dono r t r u s t fund 
f inanced p ro jec ts in k e y sectors, i n c l u d i n g agriculture, economic and ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
building, education, health, sma l l enterprise development, roads, powe r , water, m ic ro f inance , 
and pe t ro leum sector techn ica l assistance. 

Timor-Leste pioneered the model of focused assistance in a post-conflict transition on the

basis of a T rans i t iona l Results M a t r i x 6 D o n o r partnerships w i t h UNTAET and t rans i t iona l 
Governments we re gu ided b y an ac t ion m a t r i x discussed at the b iannua l development partner

conduc t ing elections, o u t l i n i n g the schedule f o r adop t ion o f the Cons t i tu t ion , and ma in ta in ing

Since the restoration of independence, the Government has taken f i r m leadership over the 
coordination of development activities and chaired the Timor-Leste and Development Partners 

Meeting (T LDPM ) w i t h the assistance of the Bank. Building o n experience w i t h the T rans i t iona l

w h i c h served t o m a i n t a i n the results-oriented approach around a who le -o f Gove rnmen t 
partnership w i t h the dono r commun i ty . T h e m a t r i x and the b iannua l j o i n t donor TSP progress 
missions became the backbone o f p o l i c y dialogue be tween Gove rnmen t and development 
partners. T h e Gove rnmen t has p ra ised the TSP f o r respec t ing ownership, building capacity in 
p r i o r i t i z i n g in te rven t ions , sha r ing lessons f r o m across the wo r ld , e x p l o i t i n g the synergies among

A whole-of-Govemment approach around a results matrix, as embodied in the TSP/CSP is 
c r i t ica l to nation building in a post-conflict environment. The Bank ’s ca ta ly t ic r o l e in 

bringing donors together has been c ruc ia l in fos te r ing a who le -o f -Gove rnmen t approach t o 
development, and shou ld be ma in ta ined independent o f the Government’s b o r r ow i n g p o l i c y . 
Con t inued emphasis o n donor coo rd ina t ion w i l l be c ruc ia l , as the who le -o f -Gove rnmen t 
approach has depended upon active engagement o n the pa r t o f a b road set o f development 
partners w h o together support the Gove rnmen t in imp lemen t ing its po l ic ies . T h e resu l t o f this 
coo rd ina t ion has been fa r greater than the sum o f i t s parts. Th rough the who le -o f - 
Gove rnmen t approach, attention w i l l need t o be p a i d t o eme rg ing issues that w i l l shape the 
coun t ry ’s future, no tab ly you th and gender. 

I t i s important to strike a balance between addressing emergency needs and planning f o r the 

long term. G i v e n the ove rwhe lm ing demands created b y the destruction in 1999, in te rna t iona l 
attention tended t o center o n the emergency. In m a n y instances immed ia te , basic needs in 
pa r t icu la r sectors were met, but the focus o n emergency assistance sac r i f iced longe r - te rm , 
m o r e integrated, sustainable results (Table 3). With hindsight, i t i s clear that sectors that were 
d isc ip l ined ea r ly o n in p lann ing f o r the t rans i t ion , such as health, are reap ing the bene f i ts 
n ow . They were able t o build an ins t i tu t iona l architecture, w i t h associated human resources, 
t o anticipate fu tu re needs. L o n g - t e rm p lann ing i s also impo r tan t t o a v o i d hasty decisions that,

Annual budget support is envisaged to continue under the CSP f o r an additional three

harmonization principles to which many o f Timor-Leste’s development partners are committed. 
Already, a group o f development partners i s collaborating in the context o f PFMCBP

implementation arrangements that w i l l minimize transaction costs for the Government and use, 
where feasible, country systems and processes. A similar approach w i l l be taken to designing and 
implementing the EFA program. I n the context of the CSP, donors have agreed to support the 
improvement o f combined sources budgeting by providing the Government with detailed 
information on annual and medium-term aid commitments and disbursements, with appropriate

A l o n g the rugged southern coast o f T imor-Les te , there are several areas where na tura l gas i s seeping through 
the earth and escaping i n t o the atmosphere. Several o f these gas seeps have been b u r n i n g f o r decades, w h i l e those 
that are no t yet bu rn ing are releasing h a rm f u l greenhouse gases. F o r every cub ic foo t per second o f gas produced, 
these na tura l seeps cou ld produce 250 kW o f power generation fo r about 25 years. Ha rves t ing the emissions f r o m

A demonstration gas seep harves t ing p ro jec t and an associated power p lan t are a k e y feature o f the power sector and

Box 9 : Building Capacity for Planning and Financial Management 
A sound p u b l i c f inanc ia l management (PFM ) system that harmonizes p lann ing , budget elaboration, and budget 
execu t ion processes i s essential to suppor t ing economic g row th and e f fec t ive service de l ive ry w h i l e ensuring proper

rema in weak, resu l t ing in s low budget execution, w i t h heavy costs to service de l ivery and j o b creation. 
The Governmen t o f T imo r -Les te has therefore requested assistance f r om i ts development partners to j o i n t l y 
elaborate a p rog ram o f capacity b u i l d i n g in p lann ing and f inanc ia l management. The proposed P FMC B P aims to 
strengthen the capac i ty o f s ta f f in M P F and in f inanc ia l management func t ions in l i n e m in is tr ies and districts.

w h i c h i s structured around three in terre la ted p i l la rs : systems and processes, attitudes and behaviors, and s k i l l s and 
know ledge . The emphasis o n systems and processes i s meant to ensure that ins t i tu t ion bu i ld ing , as w e l l as 
transparent and e f f ic ien t I T and procedura l systems, are g iven adequate a t ten t ion alongside the acqu is i t ion o f

pub l ic service and in teg r i ty . W i t h i n these three p i l lars , the p rog ram w i l l also seek to emphasize the f o l l ow i n g 
pr inc ip les : per formance orientation, f l e x i b i l i t y , sequencing, and Government ownership. 
The program ’s design w i l l re f lec t the Government’s overarching goals fo r the P F M system, as de f ined du r ing

program w i l l also inc lude on- the- job t ra in ing to build the capacity o f s ta f f to p e r f o rm the ir d a i l y tasks.

VI. RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES 

82. 

The implementation of both Timor-Leste’s NDP and the Bank’s assistance strategy is 

subject to a number of risks. G i v e n the who le -o f -Gove rnmen t character o f the CAS , the r i s k s 
faced by the Gove rnmen t and the B a n k are la rge ly the same. They inc lude (a) f rag i le 
Gove rnmen t imp lemen ta t ion capacity; (b) increased p u b l i c dissatisfaction w i t h Gove rnmen t and 
the associated emergence o f c i v i l unrest and deterioration in security; (c) wo rsen ing o f 
governance and an entrenchment o f co r rup t ion ; (d) fragmentation o f dono r assistance. 

83. 

Government implementation capacity may not improve fast enough to cu rb the increase 

in poverty. Non -pe t ro leum growth, j o b creation, and pove r ty reduc t ion depend c r i t i c a l l y o n the 
effective and e f f ic ien t imp lemen ta t ion o f Government’s rap id ly g r ow i n g budge t w i t h a focus o n

imp lemen ta t ion capacity. The C A S i s designed t o m i t iga te this risk b y focus ing squarely o n 
capacity building across Gove rnmen t f o r p lann ing , budget execution, and m o n i t o r i n g f o r results. 
Sho r t - te rm measures w i l l inc lude the dep loymen t o f in te rna t iona l s ta f f and on - the - job t ra in ing in

Special a t ten t ion w i l l be g iven t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f the cap i ta l development budget, w h i c h

Though Timor-Leste performs very we l l in f iduc ia ry accountability, this comes at a h igh 
cost to service delivery as budget execution is v e r y low . Core expenditure management systems

management benchmarks established b y the H i g h l y Indeb ted Poo r Countries (H IPC ) I n i t i a t i v e

budget execu t ion . T h o u g h comm i tmen t levels are reasonably high across a l l expenditure 
categories, w i t h to ta l expenditures (cash plus comm i tmen ts ) averaging 93 percent in aggregate

active. At end -Ma rch 2005, about USD 3 0 m i l l i o n rema ined undisbursed, and several programs 
w i l l con t inue th rough F Y 0 7 . During 2003, the TFET p o r t f o l i o experienced a pe r iod o f 
he igh tened risk and s low disbursements. Several reasons were iden t i f ied . First, high tu rnove r 
among p ro jec t f inanc ia l and procurement staff around independence tempo ra r i ly affected the 
q u a l i t y o f f i d u c i a r y management. Second, o n the Government’s request, p ro jec t management and 
imp lemen ta t ion were p rog ress ive ly in teg ra ted i n t o l i n e m in is t ry structures; though desirable, this 
shift posed some t rans i t iona l challenges. F i n a l l y , there were d i f f icu l t ies in striking an appropriate 
balance be tween sho r t - te rm phys ica l recons t ruc t ion and med ium - te rm development objectives. 
With concerted efforts t o address these d i f f icu l t ies , a l l projects are n ow ra ted satisfactory in

whether in the p ipe l ine o r active, have been a l igned w i t h the NDP, SP, and S I P S . In add i t ion ,

After the restoration of

that the B a n k w o u l d co- f inance these projects w i t h

I n the near term, recurrent cost f inanc ing i s expected to
