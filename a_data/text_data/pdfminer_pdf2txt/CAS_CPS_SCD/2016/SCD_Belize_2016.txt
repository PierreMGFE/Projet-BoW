OVERVIEW 

1. 
Belize has a rich h istory that dates back thousands o f years . The country was first inhabited by 
the Mayans with records of their presence dating from 1500 BC. The first recorded European settlement 
was established circa 1638 by the British who called the country the Colony of British Honduras. The 
official name of the territory was changed from British Honduras to Belize in June 1973, and full 
independence was granted on September 21, 1981. There were several obstacles in the path toward 
independence, as illustrated by Guatemala's long-standing claim to the entire territory. I t was only in 
November 1980, after several frustrated negotiations with Guatemala that Belizean diplomacy managed 
to obtain international support that led to the United Nations passing of a resolution that demanded the 
independence of Belize, but it was only 
in 1992 that Guatemala formally recognized Belize’s 
independence. 

2. 
After 
independence, Belize successfu lly imp lemented a development strategy wh ich 
emphas ized economic d ivers ification and private sector development at a time where the terms o f 
trade were favorab le to the country . In the mid-1980s, Belize experienced rapid economic growth in 
response to good economic management and a favorable external environment. During 1986-90, real 
GDP growth exceeded 10% per annum on average, with strong contribution from all sectors of the 
economy. Sugar export receipts grew by 80%, production and exports of citrus nearly doubled and that of 
bananas tripled. Tourism arrivals more than doubled and receipts tripled. Led by public infrastructure 
investment and tourism-related construction, construction boomed and boosted trade and transport-
related activities (see World Bank (1992)). 

3. 
In the early 1990s , the economy started to s lowdown as it su ffered from the effects o f a 
recess ion in the US economy . Agriculture and tourism were hit hard and the current account of the 
balance of payments recorded a deficit estimated at 15% of GDP in 1991, up from 5% of GDP in 1990 
(World Bank (1992)). A marked feature of the growth performance of Belize since the 1990s has been its 
high volatility. The small size of the country, its high dependence on exports and imports, and its exposure 
to natural disasters have contributed in different degrees to this volatility. Between 1994 and 2013, for 
example, losses from hydro-meteorolog ical disasters were estimated at US$71 million, with an annual 
average loss of approximately 4% of GDP. I t is estimated that if current climatic trends continue, extreme 
events will become more frequent resulting in greater fiscal impacts. D isasters could have a direct and 
large impact on economic conditions through reduced productivity, unsustainable budgetary deficits, and 
increased national debt due to reconstruction costs. Furthermore, resources appropriated to respond to 
natural disasters reduce the funding available for other development projects.  In addition, 
underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector, directly contributes 
to Belize’s vulnerability to disasters and by extension the country’s economic growth.

4. 
The limited data availab le suggests that poverty levels in Belize are h igh and substantively 
above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean . Since the early 2000s, GDP growth has been 
very close to the rate of growth of the population (estimated at 2.5%) which has led to the almost 
stagnation of GDP per capita for the last 12 years or so. Poverty data, which is available only for the years 
of 2002 and 2009 for the most recent period, show an increase in the share of the population below the 
poverty line from 34% to 42% between these two data points. Poverty is a rural phenomenon in Belize as 
rural poverty rates reached 55% in 2009 as compared to 28% in urban areas. This performance is in stark 
contrast with that of the LAC reg ion as a whole where poverty has declined from 42% in 2002 to 30% in 
2009 lifting more than 80 million from poverty. 

5. 
Based on the data availab le, the incidence o f poverty shows large spatial d ifferences . The 
bottom 40 of the population is mostly situated in rural areas with the highest rates of extreme poverty 
found in the districts of Corozal and Toledo. Poverty seems to be higher in these areas because they tend 
to concentrate households headed by individuals with low levels of schooling , exhibiting lower female 
participation in the labor market and belong ing to ethnic minorities. Income inequality is also moderately 
high with a Gini coefficient of 0.42 in 2009, but this is based on an old survey and the recent stagnation of 
real per capita in the country suggest that this might have increased in more recent years. 

6. 
As a small, open economy , that is also extremely vu lnerab le to climate change and natural 
d isasters , Belize’s ab ility to promote faster poverty reduction and greater shared prosperity will depend 
on how well the country deals with its main sources o f vu lnerab ility . Our findings show that these 
vulnerabilities have exogenous and endogenous reasons. Exogenous factors can be a blessing and 
sometimes a curse. The recent debate on the country’s potential to start exploration of offshore oil is a 
classic example g iven that Belize is also the house of the largest live coral barrier reef in the world. As 
tourism and agriculture are the country’s major sources of income and employment, the dangers 
associated with offshore oil exploration pose serious risks to Belize’s varied ecosystems and to the 
livelihoods of a significant share of the population. 

7. 
Belize’s small s ize is an important exogenous factor that makes the country vu lnerab le to terms 
o f trade shocks and creates output vo latility wh ich can affect long-term growth negatively . As the 
country needs to import most of what it consumes and relies on a few sources of foreign exchange, it 
remains pretty much vulnerable to the fluctuations of commodity prices and the performance of its few 
trade partners. The recessions faced by the US in the early 1990s and recently during the g lobal financial 
crisis and how hard Belize’s economy hurt in the aftermath of these events illustrate this vulnerability 
well. The small size also means that the country has few opportunities to grow (the availability of arable 
land in Belize at 700 Km2 in 2009 is extremely low) as it faces a situation of lack of economies of scale. 
Economic size is also an important predictor for low savings, and the situation in Belize confirms this 
stylized fact. Gross domestic savings have averaged about 10% of GDP in the recent past which is at least 
50% lower than the LAC average of 15%. With limited savings, investments remain low as well, and growth 
prospects conditioned on the ability to innovate, increase productivity, and diversify products and 
partners. Another important exogenous factor that can impact the country’s ability to grow, contribute 
to increase its debt levels, and impact savings is its high degree of exposure to natural hazards. 

2 

 
8. 
Two important endogenous factors that can affect long-term growth in Belize are associated 
with the quality o f its cap ital and labor. This SCD has shown that weaknesses in infrastructure can 
exacerbate the impacts of natural disasters on the economy. In addition, the poor quality of education 
has a direct impact of the quality of the labor force. The lack of secondary road networks and the 
vulnerability of the whole energy sector to strong winds mean that a sing le storm can leave the country 
paralyzed and in the dark for long periods of time, impeding the movement of cargo and people thus 
hurting growth and affecting negatively the livelihoods of Belizean citizens. 

9. 
Growing crime and v io lence and concerns with the lack o f competition and stab ility in the 
financial sector have also been identified as b ind ing constraints to growth in Belize. In addition to 
weaknesses in infrastructure and in the skills of the labor force, several studies have pinpointed crime and 
violence and problems in the financial sector as important deterrents to growth. The analysis in this report 
confirms the centrality of these two factors. The predicament in the financial sector is largely driven by 
the small economic size of the country and the lack of competition in the banking sector – a common 
feature in small state economies that limits the availability of credit to small and medium enterprises. 
Stability issues in the sector complicate matters as these impose non-neg lig ible risks to the health of the 
financial sector. On the other hand, the rise in the inflow of migrants from neighboring Central American 
countries with a history of crime and violence has been raised as a potential cause for high crime rates in 
Belize, but there is not enough evidence to substantiate that claim at this point. Policy interventions that 
could help halt the rise in criminality rates include ramping up the quality of education, keeping children 
at school, promoting education equivalency programs and job training , besides more direct approaches 
such as investing in safe neighborhood programs. 

10. 
Putting Belize back on a path o f faster growth that could unlock faster poverty reduction and 
greater inclus ion will requ ire will requ ire attention to a few areas in need o f b ig push . The approach 
adopted in this SCD to identify priorities to accelerate growth and boosting shared prosperity relied on 
four key considerations (see Figure 01). First, the extent to which improvements in a g iven area would 
have substantial impacts on the twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. 
Second, for a small state that faces important problems with economies of scale, it was important to take 
into account positive externalities and trade-offs associated with any proposed intervention. In this 
context, this SCD has used the existence of complementarity effects and trade-offs as an explicit criterion 
to identify priorities. Third, g iven the observed stop-go pattern of growth in Belize and the country’s 
heightened volatility to exogenous shocks and exposure to natural hazards, sustainability has been an 
important criterion helping to define priority areas of focus. Finally, an additional factor that helped 
identify priorities included the existence of self-reinforcing dynamics, which helped to introduce more 
granularity in the choice of priority areas and allowed the consideration of important nuances in the 
prioritization exercise. In practice, the approach followed three key considerations, as follows. 

3 

 
 
 
11. 
The main areas in need o f a b ig push that cou ld have the h ighest potential impact on the twin 
goals are illustrated in Figure O2 and include:  

i. 
Improving education and skills; 
ii. Addressing crime and violence; and, 
iii. Increasing resilience to climate change and natural disasters. 

Figure O1 : Pr ior it izat ion Cr iter ia 

12. 
Improv ing education and skills wou ld pos itively impact growth, inclus ion , and sustainab ility and 
these pos itive impacts wou ld be rein forced by the adoption o f an appropriate migration po licy . Higher 
learning outcomes, greater equity and access to education would better equip the labor force for the 
acquisition of skills demanded by the domestic labor markets and position them well to compete for 
better-paying jobs if they decide to emigrate. A more educated and skilled workforce would attract a more 
rewarding return to schooling and could help reduce the high reservation wage levels exhibited by 
Belizeans thus contributing to reduce the natural rate of unemployment and lowering the costs associated 
with the provision of social protection. In addition, an appropriate migration policy would ensure that the 
incoming migrants could fill the positions that many Belizeans, particularly young Belizeans, are unwilling 

4 

 
 
 
to fill. A better educated labor force would certainly have a significant impact on poverty reduction, 
especially if education outcomes are significantly improved at the secondary level, besides helping to 
develop greater backward and forward linkages in the economy. The entry points to improve education 
and skills have been amply studied and discussed. They include greater attention to pre-school education, 
ensuring primary and secondary education access for all children, improving teacher training , establishing 
quality assurance and accountability mechanisms to increase learning and improve efficiency, and 
expanding and tailoring existing vocational and training institutions to respond to the needs of the market, 
including training of migrants. 

Figure O2 : Pr ior it ies for Sustainable Growth and Inclusion 

13. 
Address ing crime and v io lence wou ld complement progress in other priority areas with positive 
sp illovers on competitiveness and u ltimately growth . The links with education and skills is obvious as a 
self-reinforcing effect could lead to better inclusion. In the short to medium-term, there are entry points 
around creating income and learning opportunities to steer the youth away from joining criminal 
organizations, creating a safer environment for learning , and ultimately contributing to raise the skills 
profile of the labor force with expected positive spillovers on competitiveness and growth. Finally, it is 

5 

 
 
 
 
essential to preserve the youth and avoid their exposure to crime, which in Belize is extremely high (at 
99% percent) and is believed to be an important risk factor for the perpetration of violence. 

14. 
Strengthening res ilience to natural d isasters and climate change along with improvements in 
the existing in frastructure in Belize are critical to support the twin goals to end extreme poverty, and 
promote shared prosperity in poorer segments o f society. Belize is one of the countries in the world 
which is most affected by weather-related events and other natural hazards. Combined, Belize incurs 
annual losses of close to 4% of GDP due to natural disasters. These losses add to fiscal pressures and 
constrain wealth accumulation. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of 
weather-related events. Poor communities are disproportionately vulnerable to economic shocks and 
reduced mobility – particularly the minority groups in the southern and northern parts of the country. The 
vulnerability in the road networks, due to the lack of redundancy, results in agricultural communities 
unable to access the larger markets in Belize City and Belmopan, students unable to attend schools, and 
goods not able to make it into rural communities. These problems are compounded by the frag ility of the 
energy network that can easily be damaged by severe storms which have hit Belize with frequency in the 
past and should remain a threat in the future. Investing in disaster risk management will help to protect 
the limited assets of poor communities from natural disasters and climate change related events and to 
improve the access and the economic livelihoods of poor and vulnerable communities. 

15. 
Cons ideration was also g iven to structural issues that cut across and wou ld comp lement 
progress in d ifferent areas , and these included :  

a. 
Improving the availability and quality of data  
b . Increasing financial inclusion; and  
c. Safeguarding fiscal sustainability.  

16. 
Belize needs a b ig push to improve the quality and availab ility o f data. In order to become more 
efficient and obtain better results governments need good data. This is true from different ang les and 
perspectives. Data are crucial to allow countries to track where they are in terms of social and human 
development and can help identify which policies work and which do not in promoting growth and shared 
prosperity. Budget decisions and policy choices have long-term effects on a country’s fiscal future and on 
the outcomes that the budget delivers for the country’s citizens. These decisions and policy choices can 
lead to much better results if they are based on rigorous and reliable evidence that can enable the 
government to select, fund, and operate public programs more strateg ically. In the case of Belize, there 
are serious limitations in the quality and availability of social and economic information that prevents the 
governments and prospective investors from making more informed decisions. These limitations can 
affect the effectiveness of government policy and inhibit new businesses. 

17. 
The availab ility o f financial serv ices remains narrow; particu larly to serve small and med ium 
enterprises .  And stability issues in the banking system do not augur well for the health of the financial 
sector. The commercial banking sector mainly focuses on large and medium scale clients.  Thus the options 
for small and medium enterprises to obtain financing from formal financial institutions are limited to 

6 

 
credit unions.  Agriculture contributes nearly 12% of GDP but the market has so far been unable to provide 
any kind of agriculture insurance in Belize. Notably missing financing instruments in the local financial 
markets are: micro-financing , micro-insurance, leasing and factoring . Once financial stability is restored, 
the development of such instruments could support greater access to finance by small and medium 
enterprises and contribute to decreasing the identified credit gap of US$1,141 million for this important 
market segment. Greater financial inclusion can also help raise savings and investments which would have 
a positive impact on growth and shared prosperity. 

18. 
Sustainab le progress towards the ach ievements o f the twin goals o f reducing poverty and 
boosting shared prosperity in Belize will also requ ire prioritiz ing fiscal sustainab ility . As a small and 
largely open economy, Belize is exposed to large terms-of-trade shocks that can introduce output 
fluctuation and affect growth negatively. A sure way to mitigate against external shocks is by building 
fiscal buffers that could help the authorities to keep a counter-cyclical fiscal stance. While the short-to-
medium term outlook for Belize remains broadly favorable, projects financed with PetroCaribe resources 
may become future fiscal liabilities. Continued efforts to promote fiscal consolidation would help create 
fiscal space to finance priority expenditures (on education and resilience, for example) and boost the 
income of the bottom 40% of the population. This is all the more important in view of the potentially 
negative impact on Belize’s public debt levels associated with the imminent need to make compensation 
payments for the nationalized utilities. In that context, Belize would do well in safeguarding fiscal 
sustainability by continuing to seek ways to strengthen its fiscal position and reduce its debt level as a 
share of GDP.  

The Process 

19. 
Consu ltations with stakeholders helped to in form th is SCD. The team has also conducted internal 
consultations with the SCD core team, including expertise from the IFC and MIGA, and with Global Practice 
colleagues. These consultations took the form of brainstorming meetings to collect feedback and inputs 
on the definition and diagnostic of the most binding constraints to growth and proposed areas of focus to 
boost shared prosperity and reduce extreme poverty in Belize. This SCD has drawn on existing material, 
new analyses commissioned for the purposes of this systemat ic effort to understand the main sources of 
growth and prosperity in the country, and crucially in consultations in country with a varied group of 
interlocutors. Throughout the consultations, there was a broad consensus on the diagnosis of the 
challenges faced by Belize and the priorities identified in this report. Above all, there was overwhelming 
recognition of the need to improve the quality of education and skills in the country g iven its spillover 
effects on competitiveness, growth, and crime and violence. 

20. 
Th is SCD is structured in s ix chapters that range from a brief description o f the main features of 
Belize to the d iscuss ion o f priorities for growth and shared prosperity. Chapter 1 presents the country 
context, highlighting Belize’s main features as a small upper middle income country that faces high 
volatility associated with its size and vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Chapter 2 discusses trends in 
poverty and shared prosperity. Chapters 2 through 5 discuss the main underlying factors that have been 
found to influence Belize’s growth performance as well as its economic, social and environmental 

7 

 
sustainability. Each of these chapters discuss in greater detail the nature of the challenges, dig deeper into 
exploring the likely causes of these challenges, and identify policy areas that could be critical for boosting 
growth and inclusion and ensuring sustainability. These chapters also identify knowledge and data gaps 
on areas where new information could help strengthen a diagnosis and inform specific actions in the 
priority areas. The sixth and final chapter has three important and distinctive features. First, it provides a 
synthesis of the analysis and findings of the previous chapters. Second, it provides a discussion of the 
approach used to identify the priorities for action in Belize. And, third, it concludes with a discussion of 
the priorities to boost shared prosperity and ensure economic, social and environmental sustainability in 
Belize.  

A Caveat 

21. 
A caveat to be aware o f at the outset is that there are many in formation gaps in Belize.  There 
have been only two poverty assessments undertaken since the last century (2002 and 2009) and 
information on social indicators, poverty, and welfare is scant. This has limited substantively the diagnosis 
of poverty and shared prosperity trends. In that context, it was not possible, for example, to understand 
better the dynamics of poverty nor its responsiveness to economic growth, nor gauge the contribution of 
different sources of income to poverty reduction. Similar data limitations prevented a more detailed 
assessment of the determinants of income inequality, the role of remittances on labor market outcomes, 
and the public-private wage differentials. Improving the quality of data and statistics on poverty and labor 
could go a long way in allowing a better diagnosis of social conditions in the country while also informing 
critical policy decisions.

A. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

22. Wh ile there is insu fficient data to adequately assess the dynamics o f poverty in Belize, overall 
poverty may have most likely worsened more recently, especially because income per cap ita has 
v irtually stagnated s ince the early 2000s . Summary economic and social indicators are presented in Table 
1. GDP per capita remained virtually flat after 2003 because the economy grew close to –and at times 
even below– the annual rate of growth of population, estimated at 2.5%. During the 2002-2009 period, 
the overall poverty rate increased from 34% to 42%, and extreme poverty increased from 11% to 16%1 . 
R ising poverty has affected all districts; for example, poverty rates have more than doubled in the Corozal 
D istrict, from 26% to 56%, and extreme poverty tripled from 6% to 21%. Corozal was also repeatedly 
impacted by hurricane and flooding , underscoring the population’s vulnerability to disasters. Income 
inequality also remains moderately high with a Gini coefficient of 0.42.  The highest economic inequality 
is concentrated among indigenous Mayan communities 2 . There is also clear evidence of a rural-urban 
divide based on lower education, low female labor participation and belong ing to ethnic minorities.

23. 
The growth pattern in Belize has been erratic and seems to be linked to po litical cycles . Growth 
appears to be closely linked to fiscal spending and the country’s external position. Over the last twenty 
years or so, the evidence shows that the current account consistently moves into deficit during periods of 
accelerated growth and then recovers during recessionary periods. According to the IDB , Belize suffers 
from lack of fiscal discipline with the country’s fiscal problems being more pronounced on the expenditure 
side. The IDB also notes that Belize’s growth accelerations have been fueled and extended by 
unsustainable public investment (Martin and Manzano (2010) p. 14). In addition to poor fiscal discipline, 
Hausmann and Klinger (2007) argue that low savings constrain access to finance in Belize. The country 
also follows a conventional peg to the US dollar which means that, as in other ECCU countries, fiscal policy 
constitutes almost the only available tool for macroeconomic management. Also similar to the ECCU 
experience, the country’s pro-cyclical fiscal behavior in periods of expansion (see Carneiro and Garrido 
(2015)) and overall lack of tax buoyancy, have led to the accumulation of debt which is now close to 75% 
of GDP. 

24. 
An open Upper Midd le Income Country (MIC) with a GNI per cap ita o f US$4,510 in 2013, Belize 
is an open economy that has integrated mostly with the Caribbean rather than with other Central or 
South American countries. Unresolved territorial disputes with Guatemala since Belize’s independence 
in 1981 have slowed progress in reg ional integration solutions. 3  Yet, Belize is a more open economy today 
than many of its comparators.  The average trade openness in Belize from 2003 to 2013 is greater than 
the averages of the Caribbean countries, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the Least Developed 
countries (LDC), Low and Middle Income countries (LMI ), and the world, but remains significantly less than 
the average of the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) (see Figure 2). However, the high openness to 
trade in Belize has been largely driven by imports resulting in relatively lower terms of trade in comparison 
with its peers. 

25. 
Desp ite hav ing a young and quickly growing population – estimated at 340,000 inhab itants in 
2013 – Belize remains sparsely popu lated . The number of Belizeans has been doubling every 30 years 
(Figure 3) 4 and at current rates of growth would double again by 2036 (Figure 4). 5   Strong net immigration

from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has contributed to population growth.  Despite the fast rate 
of growth, however, the country remains very thinly populated. 6  Combining the census data with the 
most recent available information, the best depiction of the distribution of the population of Belize (Figure 
4) confirms that the country is indeed scarcely populated with large swathes of unpopulated land.  
Belg ium has more than 33 times the population of Belize with approximately the same land mass (see

26. With a nominal GDP o f US$1.6 b illion in 2014 (ranked 172th out o f 194 in The World Bank 
Development Ind icators), Belize has a small economy heav ily concentrated on tourism and agricu lture. 
Tourism is the most important industry in Belize, representing 21% of GDP and 28% of employment. In 
2013, Belize received 294,000 tourists, a 6% increase from 2009. This recent growth has been driven by 
North America, with 70% of tourists arriving from the US and Canada. Although the majority of tourists 
arrive by water, the amount of tourists arriving by land has increased by 18% over the same period. 
Agriculture accounts for 13% of Belize’s GDP, 10.2% of its employment 7 and more than 2/3 of its exports. 8 
Some 38% of Belize land areas is suitable for agriculture but only 7% of that is currently utilized for 
farming . Traditionally Belize has grown commercial crops such as sugar and citrus fruits for export to 
Europe and the USA whereas food crops have been traditionally cultivated at a subsistence/small scale 
for local consumption.  Tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner in this small economy, 
followed by exports of crude oil, marine products, sugar, citrus, and bananas. 

27. 
Belize’s total wealth is comparab le to countries o f s imilar s ize and popu lation and is estimated 
at $20 b illion with a per cap ita wealth o f $63,188.  A wealth accounting exercise carried out for this SCD 
reveals that Belize’s total wealth per capita is comparable to that found in its income group, where the 
average for upper middle income countries is $72,700; but it is substantially lower than its reg ional 
average, which is $133,800 for Latin America and the Caribbean.  Belize’s intang ible capital, which 
captures human and social capital, comprises over half of the nation’s total wealth.  Natural capital is the 
second most important component at 40% of total wealth, dominated by the value of its protected areas.  
Produced capital makes up 12% of total wealth, and net foreign assets are quite largely negative (i.e., 
financial liabilities greater than financial assets) at negative $2 billion in total (see Table 2). 9

 Belize derives s ign ificant benefits from the ecosystem serv ices generated by the coral reefs and 
mangroves . I t has been estimated that the value of ecosystem services (fishing , tourism, shoreline 
protection) generated by the coral reefs and mangroves contributes between 15% and 22% of GDP in 
Belize (in the range of US$395–559 million per year) (Cooper, Burke, and Bood (2009)). The Belize Barrier 
Reef not only supports vibrant tourism, fishing industries, and livelihoods for communities, but also 
shelters Belize’s extensive coast from erosion and coastal damage caused by wave action. According to 
the World Resources Institute’s assessment in 2008, approximately two-thirds of the mainland coast is 
protected by coral reefs. The degree of protection varies with reef type, depth and distance from the 
shore, as well as with the elevation and slope of the shore, the geolog ical orig in of the area, and the wave 
energy along the coast. Emergent reefs, such as the Barrier Reef, can mitigate over three-quarters of wave 
energy. Reefs close to shore provide the most protection since waves have less chance to regenerate. 

29. 
As Belize is a country with extens ive, low-ly ing , coastal areas it faces s ign ificant vu lnerability to 
climate related d isasters such as trop ical cyclones and flood ing. Furthermore, the economy is small and 
concentrated with most centers of population located in the most vulnerable areas. The UNFCCC 
recognizes Belize as one of the countries most vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change due to it: 
(i) possessing a long , low-lying coastline, (ii) consisting of over 1,060 small islands, (iii) having the second 
longest barrier reef in the world (and the largest reef in the Western Hemisphere and the Americas), and 
(iv) maintaining 17,276 km2 of forest cover, each of which supports frag ile ecosystems. Thus, the 
vulnerability of the country to the foreseeable adverse physical, environmental, and economic impacts of 
climate change indicates that priority attention must be directed towards the implementation of viable 
adaptation measures targeting the most vulnerable sectors and ecosystems of Belize. 

30. 
The small s ize o f the economy and its domestic markets together with the topographic 
characteristics o f the country expose its vu lnerab ility to economic shocks and natural hazards . The 
smallness and concentration of the economy on tourism and agriculture increase the importance of 
effective trade integration. Low population density creates difficult ies for agg lomeration and scale 
economies making the provision of infrastructure inherently expensive in per capita terms. The country is 
also highly exposed to the elements being vulnerable to hurricanes, tropical storms and flooding due to

its extensive coastline topography. In additional, climate change can bring significant risks g iven the low 
elevation of much of Belize’s land area, the concentration of population in coastal areas, and the reliance 
of the economy on natural resources. 

31. 
Over the past ten to fifteen years , migration to Belize has increased sharp ly , fueled heav ily by 
po litical instab ility and unemp loyment in neighboring Central American countries and Mexico . While 
migrants have been absorbed fairly quickly into the Belizean labor market, native unemployment has 
remained high, creating questions about the role of migration in poverty reduction and shared prosperity 
in Belize. While attributing native unemployment in Belize to high migrant employment may be tempting, 
the data available does not suggest a strong causal relationship between the two phenomena. At the 
district level, native unemployment does not appear correlated to migrant labor market participation. In 
places where migrants appear to access employment opportunities by accepting wages that natives would 
not, the result may be the survival of agricultural and service industries with low and variable profit 
marg ins. I t is possible that firms in these industries would close if they could not rely on migrants and 
instead had to pay higher wages to natives; field research would be necessary to substantiate this claim. 
Thus, migration’s effect on native employment is unclear.

B. POVERTY AND SHARED PROSPERITY 

32. 
Poverty and shared prosperity are thought to have worsened in the wake o f adverse shocks 
that have affected Belize other countries in the reg ion .  Since household surveys used to calculate 
poverty and income estimates are only available infrequently in Belize (2002 and 2009), most of the 
poverty and shared prosperity data are out of data. While robust evidence is not available, there is a 
convergence of factors and related trends that indicate that poverty and shared prosperity outcomes are 
likely to have worsened since the last estimates. This is due for example to the effects of the g lobal 
financial crisis and the several natural disasters faced by the country, and the fuel price rises observed 
between 2008 and 2010. Whereas the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean have experienced major 
advances in pro-poor growth in the 21s t century, the available data on Belize shows poverty at a higher 
level in comparable periods (Figure 6).  This is evident amongst the extreme poor (indigent) and the 
moderate poor which together represent roughly the entirety of the bottom 40% of the population and 
from worsening Gini coefficients in the country (Figure 7).  This performance is in stark contrast with that 
of the LAC reg ion as a whole. Over the 2002-09 period, for which data for Belize is available, poverty in 
the LAC reg ion dropped from 42% to 30%. Roughly speaking , nearly 80 million were lifted from poverty in 
LAC between 2000 and 2012. In 2010, for the first time since comparable records exist for LAC, the 
proportion of people in the middle class exceeded the proportion of poor people. Drawing on the existing 
data, such inflection point remains far away for Belize.

Note: The sum of extreme and moderate poverty in 2009 was 42% of 
the population. Extreme (or Indigent) poverty is defined as $ 2.74 per 
day and Moderate poverty by $ 4.65 per day .  Sour ce: Governmen t

33. 
Economic stagnation, particu larly in some key sectors , and natural d isasters may have 
contributed to an increase in poverty .  GDP per capita remained virtually flat after 2003 because the 
economy grew close to –and at times even below– the annual rate of growth of the population, estimated 
around 2.5%.  The food and fuel price crisis and the g lobal economic recession further aggravated the 
economic situation of the country after 2008.  Despite the higher food prices, key agricultural sectors such 
as bananas, sugar cane, and papaya witnessed an economic slowdown.  Job creation and employment 
also decreased across the board.  In addition to this, several parts of the country such as Corozal, Orange 
Walk and Cayo were hit by severe flooding in 2007 and 2008.  These trends may have contributed to 
increase poverty in the country, although it is difficult to affirm if this is really the case in the absence of 
more recent data. 

34. 
The availab le data suggests that observed poverty levels in the past remained h igh in sp ite o f a 
s ign ificant amount o f resources spent on social protection (estimated to be in excess o f 5% o f GDP in 
2010).  This spending has not translated into results, evidenced by the large number of poor families that 
remained vulnerable in Belize up to when data was available. The Social Protection System in Belize is 
inadequate to address the risks these vulnerable groups face due to poor resource allocation, weak 
targeting , and low program effectiveness. When facing hardship, the poor most often seek informal 
sources of assistance to solve their problems, which underscores the limitations of Belize’s existing safety 
net.

Shared prosperity may have also worsened in Belize. This inference is informed by the contraction 
implied by decreasing average per capita income in the time period (1993-1998) when POVCALNET data 
was available (Figure 8). 10 The bottom-40 is mostly situated in rural areas (Table 2). 11  There are also large 
spatial differences in the incidence of poverty in Belize.  While extreme and moderate poverty increased 
in all districts but Toledo, the poverty headcount as of 2009 varies across districts.  Available data show 
that 46% of the households in Toledo and Corozal —the districts with the highest poverty rate in the 
country—are poor ().  Also, whereas household poverty fell from 67% to 46% in Toledo between 2002 and 
2009, attributed largely to an increase in cocoa production, it more than doubled in Corozal, jumping from 
20% to 46%.  Conversely, the district with the lowest incidence of poverty is Belize City with 21% of the 
households falling below the poverty line. The incidence of extreme poverty is also heterogeneous across 
districts.  The fraction of households that live below the extreme poverty line is almost four times larger 
in Toledo than in the overall country. Similarly, districts such as Corozal, Stann Creek or Orange Walk have 
extreme poverty rates that are above the national average (Figure 10)

Househo lds in rural areas with a larger number o f members headed by ind iv iduals with low 
levels o f education , exh ib iting lower female labor participation and belong ing to ethn ic minorities are 
more likely to be poor.  Looking at the numbers for 2009, poverty –measured at the household level– is 
twice as large among rural households (43%) relative to urban households (21%) (Table 3).  Poverty is also 
correlated with the size of the household: 59% of households with six or more members are poor 
compared to 26% of households with four individuals.  Similarly, the incidence of poverty varies with the 
level of education of the household head.  Half of the households whose heads have none or incomplete 
primary education are poor, a proportion that falls to 18% for those that accumulate secondary education.  
Regarding labor force participation, households where women work are far less likely to be below the 
poverty line.

The existing data shows that the Mayans have the h ighest poverty incidence levels . Breaking 
down the population by ethnic groups Mayans have twice the poverty incidence experienced by Creoles 
in Belize (Table 4) or other ethnic minorities.  Poverty incidence by gender, on the other hand, does not 
seem to indicate any significant disadvantage to women. In fact, the data available shows lower poverty

of poverty, including significant shortcomings in the quality of education, as well as the social policies 
which the Government has pursued to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity are reviewed in 
chapter 5.

Growth Performance – Stop and Go 

38. 
There are two main growth sectors in Belize: agri-bus iness and tourism.  Tourism is the sing le 
most important industry, contributing roughly 28% of employment and 21% of GDP.  The country’s natural 
beauty is the main attraction, making eco-tourism a specialty in Belize which has the world’s most 
important live coral reefs and lush forests that have unfortunately been subject to frequent illegal logg ing 
activity.  Small enterprises play an unusually large role in Belize’s tourism sector, compared with more 
traditional destinations such as The Bahamas and Barbados.  Agriculture, forestry, and fishing were 
traditionally the dominant industry.  Despite a decline in value added as a percentage of GDP from 21% in 
1986 to 13% in 2008, they remain an important source of employment, exports, and value added.  The 
most important crops are sugar, citrus, and bananas.  These have been complemented by industrial 
production, including light manufacturing , mainly of agricultural products. 

39. 
  The tourism sector has strong potential to increase growth and investment in Belize. The sector 
is now operating under the National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan (“The Master Plan”) that sets the 
tourism strategy and objectives through 2030. While the Master Plan envisions a 3.8% CAGR increase in 
the tourism sector by 2030, current estimates put overnight sector growth alone at 9%. Going forward, 
the Master Plan envisions a balancing of the past smaller-scale, boutique tourism model with one 
including more flagship properties.  Belize had not been able to attract larger-scale flagships due to its risk 
profile, recent nationalizations, and non-conducive leg islative framework. The leg islative framework 
would require increased clarity in terms of how FD I is processed and evaluated to create a level playing 
field for both FD I and local investment. Currently 60% of accommodations are owned by local investment 
40% are owned by expatriates. The finalization of the Master Plan has been welcome from investors. 
Belize is also evaluating how to bring more tourists from non-US destinations (like Europe and South 
America) as well as opportunities in medical tourism due to lower relative healthcare costs and proximity 
to US markets. Costa R ica is Belize’s primary competitor, followed by Guatemala. 

40. 
The agri-bus iness sector also exh ib its strong growth potential.  Agri-business potential exists 
where citrus fruit and livestock production could be converted to value added products for exports and 
use in the tourism sector. Value-addition has already begun with sauces and spices but could extend to 
jams, jellies and fruit juices. This would require attracting international buyers, processors and growers to 
Belize. The future growth of agro-processing in Belize will depend on: i) Trade policies in Europe where 
Belize sells most of its sugar due to preferential access (expiring in 2016), ii) an increase in commercial 
food farming requiring inputs such a capital for land development, irrigation facilities, the availability of 
large land parcels without imping ing on protected biodiversity areas, the opening of new export markets 
and, iii) transport, storage and log istic infrastructure for cash crops and processed products. Positive 
developments have already occurred in the market evidenced by diversification into non-traditional crops 
such as papaya, hot peppers and cocoa, two large FD Is in the sugar sector in 2012, Caribbean countries 
exploring supplies from Belize, and reg ional companies looking to expand into the Central American 
market via Belize. 

20 

 
41. 
The o il sector is an ever present option in terms o f d ivers ify ing sources o f growth and revenues 
but it attracts a great deal o f challenges and risks .  Oil production at Spanish Lookout near the inland 
border with Guatemala started in late 2005/early 2006 and now contributes roughly 7% of GDP although 
reserves are dwindling rapidly. Exploration of off-shore oil production opens up significant wealth creating 
opportunities, but it also presents challenges as it would likely impact biodiversity, the coral reef and eco-
tourism, themes which are discussed in chapter 5.  Government oil revenue has been an important 
complement to tax income, although it has been declining rapidly in recent years and now also impacted 
by the recent plunge in oil prices. 12 Food processing and other services comprise the remainder of private 
sector manufacturing activities. The information communication technology (ICT) industry may be 
promising , g iven Belize’s proximity to the US and Belize’s adoption of Eng lish as its official language. 

42. 
Emp loyment has been growing most qu ickly in the serv ices sector (69% o f the total in 2012 vs. 
58.5% in 2000) where the pub lic sector is large and growing rap id ly . The services sector represents 
roughly 45% of the country’s total exports.  I t is also important to underscore that the public sector in 
Belize is large in relation to the economy and has a tendency to grow rapidly. For example, Belize’s public 
sector wage bill is high by reg ional and international standards. 13 Belize’s wage bill increased significantly 
since 2000 partly because of a doubling of the government payroll, including teachers, but as reviewed in 
the next section, educational achievement in Belize remains well below reg ional levels.  The wage bill also 
increased because of very generous salary increases that were well above inflation.  On average, public 
sector wages increased by 5.5% per year during 2000-2013, compared with an inflation rate of 2.1% per 
year during the same period. 

43. 

Per cap ita income growth in Belize has been vo latile relative to other LAC and MIC countries, as 
well as in relation to S IDS .  Two cycles of intense growth are evident in Belize since 1980 (Figure 11).  The 
first was associated with a boom in tourism that was initially financed by FD I flows and, once they dried, 
by a sharp increase in government investment. The expansion in government expenditure quickly shifted 
the public sector from overall balance in the 1980s to a deficit of 8% of GDP by 1993.  This was mirrored 
by an even larger current account deficit. An adjustment program ensued which coincided with stagnant 
per capita income levels (Figure 12). 

12 Dur i ng fi scal yea rs 2009 through 2011 , the Government recei ved a bout $100 mi llion i n revenues from Belize 
Na tura l Energy (BNE), 60% of which was in the form of i ncome ta x, 24% was in royalties, and 16% was in working 
i nteres t a nd produc ti on s ha r i ng.  See Wa ca s ter (2013 ).

44. 
Economic performance during the early to mid -1980s was affected by the sharp deterioration 
o f the country 's terms o f trade and an inadequate domestic po licy response. Economic growth averaged 
only 1.2% per year during that period. In 1984, real GDP growth expanded by 4.4% in the wake of a 
temporary recovery of sugar prices and increases in public expenditures. However, that rate of growth 
was not sustainable since it was achieved by means of expansionary demand management policies that 
resulted in non-sustainable domestic and external imbalances. In 1985, economic growth slowed down 
to 2% as sugar prices and exports fell to their lowest level in six years. The Government responded to the 
deteriorating economic conditions by introducing tight demand management policies designed to 
eliminate domestic and external imbalances.  

45. 
In 1986, the economy recovered as real GDP rose by 5% reflecting the expansion in construction 
and serv ices . Substantial increases in the production of bananas, oranges and grapefruit were achieved. 
In 1987, real GDP expanded by almost 14%. This spectacular growth reflected sharp increases in practically 
all economic activities and was fueled by rapidly expanding exports of bananas, citrus concentrates, 
garments and tourism. The increase in banana output was promoted by the privatization of the industry 
in 1985 which enabled farmers to respond adequately to the higher prices in the preferential UK market. 
The increase in citrus production, in turn, stemmed from the opening of the US market through the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative.  

46. 
In the second half o f the 1980s , real GDP growth exceeded 10% per annum on average, with 
strong contribution from all sector o f the economy . Sugar export receipts grew by 80%, production and 
exports of citrus nearly doubled and that of bananas tripled. Tourism arrivals more than doubled and 
receipts tripled. Led by public infrastructure investment and tourism-relate construction, construction 
boomed and in turn boosted trade and transport-related activities.  

22 

 
 
 
 
 
47. Macroeconomic po licies p layed a key ro le in the improvement o f Belize's economic 
performance during 1985-90. After the successful implementation of a stabilization program supported 
by an IMF arrangement in 1985, Belize made steady improvement in the fiscal performance while 
expanding its infrastructure investment. The real exchange rate depreciated vis-à-vis the dollar and 
private sector activity and capital inflows increased. On the external front, Belize benefitted from a wide 
array of preferential trade agreements and improvements in the terms of trade; as well as the 
depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Official grants also provided the country technical and financial support 
for public investment and other development initiatives.  

48. 
The performance s ince the mid -1980s contrasts sharply with the economic d ifficu lties faced by 
Belize during the early 1980s , a period where sharp declines in export earnings and the Government 's 
efforts to stimulate the economy by running fiscal deficits led to a deterioration of internal and external 
imbalances. Real GDP growth was over percentage points higher during 1986-1990 than in 1981-1985; 
inflation, was almost 4 percentage points lower over the same period; the current account deficit 
improved; and international reserves increased sharply. 

49. 
In the early 1990s , the once favorab le external env ironment turned against Belize. Growth 
slowed in the United States and in Europe, lowering prices for Belize's merchandise exports and 
dampening the demand for tourism. The country's terms of trade weakened, and concessional financing 
dried up. The British Government withdrew its troops, a development that is estimated to have reduced 
gross domestic expenditure by 5%. This reduction amounts to more than the production of the citrus 
industry, Belize's third largest industry, and constitutes a substantial shock. These economic downturns 
were exacerbated by increases in interest rates caused by high fiscal deficits. Beg inning in 1993, the 
economy faced a significant slowdown, and real GDP growth averaged about 2.7% a year, the same rate 
of population growth, leading to the stagnation of income per capita that has lasted until today.   

50. 
Another boom-bust cycle was ushered in the late 1990s with a new round o f government 
expend iture financed principally by foreign borrowing. Both episodes of stop and go growth broadly 
coincided with long stretches of flat per capita income levels in Belize. 14   Per capita income in the country 
has remained stagnant since the early 2000s.  To be sure, the country did double average per capita 
income levels since 1980, but in relation to other LAC countries, Belize’s per capita income performance 
which was average in the 1990s has become a laggard in the 2000s (Figure 12). 

51. 
During the last decade, economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean was very d ifferent 
than the growth experienced in during the 1990s . Moreover, economic development seems very 
heterogeneous in the LAC reg ion, with some countries surpassing previous growth performance and 
others lagg ing behind. Belize has been one of the countries that have backslided during the last decade, 
experiencing slower growth rates than in the previous one (Figure 13).

52. 
Once a top performer, Belize is now lagg ing beh ind due to insufficient structural reforms in a 
number o f areas . In order to have a better understanding of the drivers of economic development of the 
different countries in Latin America during the last decade, Araujo et al. (2015) have revisited the Loyaza 
et al. (2005) study on the determinants of growth in the reg ion, in order to assess which variables related 
to structural and stabilization policies matters most for the growth in the LAC countries. Using 5-year non-
overlapping panel data for a sample of 126 countries during the 1970-2010 period, the study replicates 
observed GDP per capita growth and assess how much of the contribution to predicted GDP arises from 
persistence, structural policies, stabilization and external conditions. The results of the study allow us to 
estimate counterfactual levels of GDP per capita for the LAC countries by benchmarking the determinants 
of growth (Figure 14). In the case of Belize, the study shows that the country was a top performer among 
the LAC countries in terms of the stabilization index, using the variables related to stabilization policies 
(inflation, real exchange rate and banking crisis). With respect to the variables related to structural policies 
(financial development, education, political institutions, trade openness, infrastructure and government 
size), Belize`s index was below the median for the LAC countries (the dotted line).  The analysis g ives a 
sense that more could have been done in the field of structural policies to improve Belize`s economic 
performance in the period.

53. Much o f the stop and go growth can be attributed to poor fiscal d iscip line . Empirical evidence 
produced by the SCD team following the methodology of Frankel, Vegh and Vuletin (2014) suggests that 
fiscal and budgetary policies in Belize have followed a strong pro-cyclical stance during most of the 1990s 
(see Carneiro and Garrido (2015)). This has only recently been converted into a mild counter-cyclical 
stance after 2005 (see Figure 15 which shows Belize as “recent graduate” from pro-cyclical fiscal policy).  
As a result, it has only been in recent years that the Government has been able to support economic 
activity during a downturn without fanning the flames of a boom-bust cycle.  Given a fixed exchange rate 
to the US dollar, monetary policy is not used actively to dampen the business cycle. The outlook beyond 
2015 is for the fiscal primary balance to remain in deficit (currently at 1.5% of GDP in 2014) because of 
expansionary fiscal policies— including wage increases and new projects financed with PetroCaribe

policy buffers needed to help contain downside risks.

The country ’s fiscal s ituation has been characterized by consecutive years o f deficits wh ich 
improved after the deb t exchange in mid -2000s but has started to deteriorate after a second 
restructuring on 2012-13 on the back o f falling revenues from the o il sector. The expansionary policies 
adopted in the 1990s through to the first half of 2000s contributed to a significant deterioration in the 
fiscal account 17 . The fiscal deficit climbed to 10 percent of GDP in 2003 from 2 percent of GDP in 1996. 
Concurrently, the stock of debt soared to over 100 percent of GDP in 2003/4, an increase of approximately 
30 percentage points in 3 years. R ising world oil prices and declining export prices coupled with sharp 
increase in external debt service led to a significant current account deficit which was principally financed 
through a build-up of external public debt. As debt service obligations rose and market financing became 
increasing ly difficult to secure, the government resorted to financing from the central bank, whose 
international reserves fell below one month of import coverage by end-2005. This erosion of reserves left 
the Belizean economy highly vulnerable to both endogenous and exogenous shocks. 

55. 
The bu lk o f the GOB’s revenues are derived from taxes , accounting for approximately 86 
percent o f total revenues in recent years . In spite of the absence of any analysis of the effect of taxation 
on poverty and inequality in Belize, close to 60 percent of taxes are from VAT and tariffs. Income taxes 
which are usually more progressive, accounting for around 28 percent of annual revenues. Revenues from 

16 Bel i ze imports a n average US$84 million of oil per yea r through the PetroCaribe program. The res ulting debt, used 
for i nfrastruc ture projects and balance of payment suppor t, has built up to 9 percent of GDP (see Va rma et a l. (2015)).

the oil sector has been on the decline and it is anticipated that oil revenues will continue to fall, particularly 
in the current context of falling prices as well as capacity constraints at existing wells. In this context, the 
overall structure of the fiscal system on the revenue side is largely regressive. The government commits, 
on average, 14 percent of budgeted expenditure to subsidies and current transfers, which are in 
principle meant to be more beneficial to those at the bottom of the income distribution, however, in the 
absence of a formal targeting mechanism it is difficult to delineate alignment with poverty reduction 
priorities. 

56. 
The stop and go pattern might also be attributed to terms o f trade shocks g iven the 
preponderance o f agricu lture and commod ity exports o f Belize.  Although Belize shows a degree of 
economic diversification which is higher than other small states, the composition of exports is still 
concentrated on primary products and other goods without much technolog ical sophistication (see Figure 
16).  The high openness to trade in Belize has not yet translated into greater export diversification and 
sophistication (see Figure 17) while the country also has one of the highest tariff reg imes in the world 
(Figure 18).  Producers, especially exporters, also faces distortions to incentives and high costs created by 
the high and uneven tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and associated tax policy distortions (see IADB, 
2013b). The limits on export diversification and high costs associated with tariff barriers observed in Belize 
are to a great extent associated with the country’s size, as smaller countries face several challenges to 
diversify and trend to have high tariffs.

The degree o f export d ivers ification in Belize is h igher than what wou ld be predicted by its level 
o f economic development. Figures 19.a and Figure 19.b. the U-shaped relationship between sectoral 
export diversification (Y-axis) and the level of development (GDP per capita on X-axis) for Belize and a few

export basket as they get richer (the negative slop side of the U) until a certain level of development (zero 
slop of the U). At higher levels of development, countries tend to concentrate their exports in some key 
sectors benefiting from the effects of specialization. The Hirshman-Herfindhal Index of export 
concentration (HHI ) 18 in both 2003 and 2013 reveals that Belize’s export basket is diversified relative to 
its level of development. Most importantly, the extent of export diversification has increased in 2013 
compared to 2003 level as demonstrated by the shift of Belize away from the U-shape that indicates a 
reduction in the concentration index (HHI ) from 2003 to 2013.

58. Wh ile Belize shows s igns o f export d ivers ification across products and markets , the 
techno log ical content o f its export remains low. As expected from an economy that specializes in 
agriculture and tourism, the level of complexity of Belize’s export products remains low and its 
composition has not changed much over the past decade. Since 2003, primary products have dominated 
in Belize’s export basket representing more than 50 percent of the country’s exports. More than half of 
the country’s export goods were primary products in 2003 as well as in 2013. Resources based products 
are the second highly exported goods in Belize, although their share dropped from 36 percent of total 
export in 2003 to 25 percent in 2013. High Technology embodied products are the least exported from 
Belize. High technology goods barely represented 1 percent of Belize’s total export in 2003 and

As a small economy , Belize con fronts ind iv is ibilities in the prov is ion o f pub lic goods and services 
includ ing in governance, institutions, and in frastructure among others .  On average, small states spend 
3.7% more of their GDP on producing public goods and services (see Favaro (2008)).  Recent research has 
also shown that there is a clear negative relationship between population size and public 
expenditure/GDP amongst SIDS which is also apparent for Belize (Figure 21). 19 The high fixed cost of 
governance and infrastructure leaves fewer resources for saving .  Gross domestic savings/GDP has 
averaged around 10% in recent years in Belize which is well below the LAC average (Figure 22) whereas 
gross fixed capital formation/GDP in Belize has averaged about 20%.  A domestic savings gap of this 
magnitude predisposes economies to current account deficits and a corresponding buildup of sovereign 
debt, although most SIDS and Caribbean economies are primarily financed through foreign direct 
investment (FD I ) and remittances.  In the case of Belize, capital inflows, especially FD I , are very large 
relative to GDP (Figure 23).  FD I inflows averaged 9.2% of GDP in the country from 2005 to 2012 and 
represented more than 49% of gross fixed capital formation, versus 4.1% and 18% for Latin America.   
Other things being equal, higher FD I would usually be expected to raise the growth rate of a country 
through its impact on productivity.  But this has not always been the case in Belize.  Part of the reason 
might be that earnings from FD I are mostly repatriated (Figure 24) and not reinvested in the country.

Growth Determinants 

60. 
There has been substantive work that relies on the so -called “growth d iagnostic” framework 
attempting to exp lain why per cap ita growth in Belize has stalled .  For example, the Hausmann, Rodrik, 
Velasco (2004) (HRV) framework explicitly attempts to identify the most binding constraint to growth 
which in principle should yield the greatest policy “bang per buck”. 20  In the case of Belize, Hausmann and 
Klinger (2007) undertook a growth diagnostic of the country and their findings are reported in Annex 1.  
The authors conclude that access to finance was the most binding constraint to economic growth in Belize 
in the middle of the last decade.  In particular, they highlight low savings, low access to international 
finance, and the high domestic cost of finance.  These problems were linked to government-led 
investment during expansion periods that induced public deficits, crowding out and the high cost of 
finance. 

61. 
Often cited as a s ign ificant b ind ing constraint to growth , Belize’s financial system is v iewed as 
constrain ing cred it.   Belize has one of the highest spreads between lending and borrowing rates in the 
reg ion reflecting a lack of competition (see Figure 25 and Figure 26). The banking system is highly liquid, 
yet access to finance remains a key constraint for underserved groups. Factors affecting access to finance 
include underdeveloped financial infrastructure, low literacy levels, complex requirements to access 
credit (immovable collateral), few products (little use of factoring or cash flow based lending , prohibitive 
costs of micro-insurance) and, on the real side, few productive activities due to high cost of doing business 
in Belize. According to the IMF (2014), Belize’s financial sector continues to pose non-neg lig ible financial 
stability and fiscal risks, although the gap between non-performing loans (NPLs) and provisions has been 
narrowing . The EMB I spread of Belize remains at high levels, significantly higher than the average for LAC 
or Jamaica. However, g iven the small size of the country, the costs for commercial banks to operate in the 
country are expected to remain high as they actually are in comparable countries which share the same 
characteristics as Belize’s. 

62. 
The excess liqu id ity in the banking system is not accompan ied by pro fitab ility . As argued in a 
recent IMF report, the accumulation of reserves above statutory requirement is a recurrent practice in 
Belize but these reserves are not evenly distributed across banks. One domestic bank accounts for about 
60% of the total. In addition, loan write-offs, high NPLs and increased provisioning are eroding net 
earnings. The banking sector’s returns on assets have become positive in 2013 for the first time since 
2010. The Central Bank of Belize’s new regulation requiring higher provisioning and more stringent loan 
classification, including write-offs, has mitigated some of the risk in the sector but loan concentrations 
remain a concern and an asset quality review of the underlying collaterals could be beneficial to the 
system.  

20 See Ha usmann, Kl inger a nd Wa gner (2008).  As expl a ined i n Ga r r ido, Hami d, a nd Sa l isbury (2014 ), the HRV 
framework appeals to the l ogic of Li ebig’s Law (after German chemist Justus Von Li ebig) also known as the Law of 
Limi ti ng Fac tors a pplied to a gr icultural s cience whi ch s tates tha t a pl ant’s per formance i s a ffected not by the most 
a bundant res ource, but by the mos t defi c i ent one (very much l ike a Leonti ef produc tion function). A pl a nt will only 
yi el d a s much a s the l ea s t a va i l a bl e nutr i ent a l l ows .

63. 
During consultations with stakeholders, the topic o f correspondent banking linkages emerged 
as a s ign ificant concern .  Recent considerations by the U.S. Treasury concerning de-risking measures 
surrounding AML/CFT concerns have resulted in some US banks closing their correspondent banking 
relationship with Belizean banks.  This has raised a high level of concern both for the Government and the 
domestic commercial banks and international banks operating in Belize.  Given the close economic 
relationship with the US and the relative small number of financial institutions operating in Belize, 
reconsidering correspondent banking linkages could have a magnified impact on Belize’ financial sector. 

64. 
 A limitation o f the HRV growth d iagnostic framework, however, is the dynamic nature o f 
constraints.   As some are removed others become binding .  Furthermore, any outstanding or emerg ing 
issue can turn into a binding constraint as a result of policy inaction, policy errors, or some external 

33 

 
 
 
 
factor. 21  In the case of Belize, and since the time in which the HRV growth diagnostic was prepared (2007), 
the high cost of finance has remained a significant constraint in the country, although perhaps less binding 
now than at that time.  While high spreads between savings and lending rates (lack of competition in the 
banking sector) and low access to finance (as reported in Enterprise Surveys to be discussed below) have 
persisted, deposit and savings rates have come down by more than half (Figure 26) and the country has 
benefited from high FD I (Figure 23).  

65. 
Recent research shows that h igh interest rate marg ins , in add ition to other financial sector 
ind icators , affect economic growth negatively . Evidence from ten new EU members on the relationship 
between economic growth and financial sector development shows that the improved efficiency of the 
banking sector has played an important role as an eng ine of growth (Caporale et al. (2009)).  In particular, 
the results show that liquid liabilities, the interest rate marg in and reforms in the financial sector are all 
correlated with economic growth. Further, causality tests between economic growth and the interest rate 
marg ins show that causality runs from banking efficiency to economic growth and not the other way 
around in the EU-10; where a reduction in interest rate marg ins causes economic growth.  Preliminary 
analysis for Belize shows a similar direction of causality. 

66. 
The need to improve competition in the financial sector in Belize has led the Government to 
act.  In this context, a state-owned bank to stimulate greater competition in the banking sector has 
recently been created by the authorities.  The issue here is that the creation of state owned enterprises 
do not resolve the national savings shortage nor do they solve the information gaps that may be behind 
the financial constraints in Belize.  Lending on non-market terms can also easily become a slippery slope 
to lower investment efficiency and possibly bankruptcy. 22 

67. 
A recent update o f the 2007 growth d iagnostic o f Belize has identified d ifferent b ind ing 
constraints to growth . Martin (2015) has used more evidence to update the results of 2007 HRV growth 
diagnostic analysis and has arrived at different conclusions. In the most recent context, the most 
important binding constraint to growth in Belize seems to be related to an apparent anti-export bias in 
public policy that the author associates with an out of date trade policy. Another important constraint to 
growth identified by the author was the bad quality of infrastructure, especially roads and ports, which 
seem to affect the most the two main drivers of growth in the country, agribusiness and tourism. The high 
cost of domestic of finance was also ranked as a persistent constraint to growth, albeit of secondary 
importance now in comparison with the results of 2007. 

68. 
There are, however, d ifferent approaches that po int to additional and equally important factors 
that may be affecting growth in Belize. A different approach to estimate the drivers of economic 
development was undertaken by Araujo et al (2015) which revisited the Loayza, Fajnzylber and Calderón 
(2005) study on the determinants of growth in LAC.  The study aims to assess which variables related to

structural and stabilization policies matter most for growth.  Using 5-year non-overlapping panel data 
during the 1970-2010 period and system-GMM estimation to correct for endogeneity biases, the study 
replicates observed GDP per capita growth and assesses how much of the contribution to predicted GDP 
arises from persistence, structural policies, stabilization and external conditions. The results of the study 
allow estimat ion of counterfactual levels of GDP per capita for the different LAC countries by 
benchmarking the determinants of growth. 

69. 
Accord ing to Arau jo et al. (2015), the most b ind ing constraints on growth in Belize are the lack 
o f structural reforms includ ing the pers istence o f trade barriers .  I f during the 2005-2010 period Belize’s 
trade openness had been the equivalent to the 90th percentile value for Latin America, its real per capita 
GDP would have been 12% higher (see Figure 27). As noted, producers in Belize, especially exporters, 
faces distortions to incentives and high costs created by the high and uneven tariff and non-tariff barriers 
to trade and associated tax policy distortions.  Additionally, excess government size (for example, the high 
public sector wage bill), insufficient infrastructure investments, inadequate access to finance and poor 
school quality were also found to be significant constraints on per capita income growth in the Araujo 
study.  

70. 
In fact, in frastructure quality in Belize appears to be an important constraint in a number of 
areas . Available evidence suggests that the country has been severely affected by a significant contraction 
in public investment and the continuation of extreme and damag ing climate events.  Annual gross capital 
formation/GDP averaged 21.6% from 1991 to 2013 in Belize.  I t was about the same from 2000-2008, but 
it has since fallen to an average of only 16.7% in the most recent period of 2009-2013. Furthermore, the 
proportion of the Belizean road system considered to be in poor or bad condition increased from 12% 
(2007-2008) to almost 60% (2012-2013) (see IDB (2013)).  The quality and maintenance of public 
infrastructure has been affected by both extreme weather events and the need to adjust government 
expenditure g iven high public debt levels.  In addition, investable opportunities (self-discovery) might also 
be affected by factors other than access to or the cost of finance as evidenced by the high annual 
repatriation rates (low re-investment rates) of FD I and the Enterprise Survey findings to be discussed 
below.  The high liquidity of the Belizean banking sector is partly justified by the banks due to the limited 
investment opportunities in the country.

71. 
A th ird approach to economic constraints can be found in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys 
wh ich prov ides firm-level data that benchmark the quality o f the business environment.  As can be seen 
in Figure 28, and from the point of view of the business community, Belize may need to invest in a better 
skilled labor force, lower tax rates, improved access to finance and improved transportation infrastructure 
to strengthen growth outcomes and to get more productivity spillovers from FD I .  Tax rates appeared as 
the top concern to businesses. Rates are actually relatively low as businesses pay 31% of profit in taxes in 
Belize against 48% in average in LAC, according to the Doing Business Report 2015.  However, the private 
sector is demanding to solve underlying structural issues in the business taxation reg ime that hamper 
formal enterprise growth. 23  These include misalignments and inefficiencies of the business tax reg ime 
and discretionary application of tax requirements and exemptions that create an uneven playing field for 
businesses. Note that relative to the rest of LAC and the world, Enterprises find that Belize is most 
constrained by deficient infrastructure. 

72. 
Crime and v io lence is also o ften cited as an important obstacle to bus inesses in Belize. Besides 
being a concern from the social sustainability point of view, crime and violence pose a threat to the 
country’s competitiveness. In 2010, Belize ranked 123rd out of 142 countries g lobally 
in the 
competitiveness index computed by the World Economic Forum (WEF (2011)), with institutional factors 
(including security institutions) considered the fourth most serious concern (this will be addressed in 
greater detail in the next chapter). In terms of the costs of crime and violence to business, the 
performance of Belize is comparable to its neighbors (Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) who 
together with Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela; and, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti and Jamaica are all 
ranked in the bottom 10. In the 2010 Enterprise Survey, over 50 percent of firms in Belize considered 
crime, theft, and unrest a major constraint to their businesses, with nearly 12 percent citing this as the 
principal constraint (World Bank (2010)). Anecdotal evidence obtained from focus group discussions with 
the Belize Tourism Board and the Belize Chamber of Commerce suggests that crime is the biggest threat 
to the tourism industry, which is the leading economic sector in Belize. This perception seems to be in line

with the evidence in Figure 28 which indicates that crime is a bigger problem for businesses in Belize than 
in the LAC reg ion or the world at large. 

73. 
A fourth method for analyzing long run growth determinants is the standard growth accounting 
model emp loy ing a s imp le Cobb -Doug lass production function .  Using this methodology, labor is the key 
factor accounting for growth in Belize, but it is also apparent that the country may be suffering from an 
“efficiency” deficit g iven negative Total Factor Productivity (Figure 29).  This residual outcome may be 
interpreted to mean that productivity spill-overs from relatively abundant FD I in the country are marg inal, 
despite evidence of significant backward and forward linkages from FD I in Belize relative to the Central 
America, the Caribbean as well as South America and Mexico (Figure 30).

Emerging Focus Areas from the Comparative Methods 

74. 
Different sources and methods con firm that growth outcomes in Belize are affected by a 
number o f important factors under the control o f the authorities . These include education and skills, 
access to finance, infrastructure, and crime (see Table 6). The cross-country benchmarking exercise 
confirmed that growth could be boosted with improvements in the quality of infrastructure (especially 
the road network), better access to finance, and a better educated labor force. The analysis of 
microeconomic survey data highlighted crime and violence, as well as the inadequate supply of skilled 
labor, as the main factors affecting firm performance in Belize. There were other factors that were raised 
in some but not all analyses, perhaps due to the use of different methodolog ies and definitions, and these 
included trade barriers, the size of government, the cost of domestic finance, and access to international 
finance. In addition, a limitation of all of the approaches considered is that they fail to sing le out the lack 
of scale as an explicit binding constraint to growth in small economies.

Note: The table shows the main factors that have been found to affect growth according to different methods and approaches. Emerg
of focus are those that appear in at least two different methods. 

Policy Areas that Could Boost Growth 

75. 
Improv ing the q uality o f education will have a beneficial effect on the skills pro file o f the labor 
force and impact growth pos itively through a number o f d ifferent channels . The evidence presented 
above and the results of discussions and in-country consultations with Belizean authorities and 
stakeholders reveals the importance of improving the quality of education. This could have a positive 
effect on skills and competitiveness and ultimately growth. While the quality of education will be 
discussed in more detail in the next chapter, it is important to stress at this point that better learning 
outcomes would position Belizean youth better to find better paying jobs in the domestic labor market or 
in potential markets overseas. To date, returns to skilled labor are concentrated in the public sector, and 
most sectors in Belize rely on unskilled labor. This is likely driven by supply-side constraints in Belize’s 
labor market. For businesses to engage in high productivity activities, a better skilled labor force is 
necessary. While the traditional schooling system of Belize scores high in terms of primary education 
completion rates, it is weak in secondary and almost all other measures of education. Additionally, quality 
and skills are also reported as inadequate by businesses despite rising public spending on education. 
Businesses and consulting services and training providers indicate that recent graduates (both from high 
school and university) do not possess the level of skills required by the job market. This suggests that 
significant investments are required to bridge the skills gap so as to ensure the labor force can meet the 
market demands.  

76. 
Address ing financial inclusion can help increase sav ings and in fluence growth positively through 
investments . During consultations, stakeholders in Belize noted difficulties associated not only with the 
high domestic cost financing , which tends to be a common feature in small states g iven issues of scale, 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but also challenges faced by banks in establishing the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers and the 
profitability of their projects. Bankers cited as common the behavior of loan applicants not willing to 
disclose their information or loan applications without a clear cost-benefit analysis. In Belize, SMEs 
account for 70 percent of private sector employment and incomes, and contribute significantly to the GDP 
(Seepersaud (2012)). At the same time, SMEs have the most difficulty in accessing finance, both due to 
lack of real estate to pledge as collateral and substandard financial knowledge and management capacity. 
Policies that could promote financial literacy and innovative financing for small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs), such as the introduction of factoring and leasing , for example, could go a long way to stimulate 
economic activity.  

77. 
In frastructure deficiencies in Belize present major obstacles to the growth and competitiveness 
o f enterprises and the economy. D iscussions with foreign investors and with government officials 
confirmed that the poor quality of the transport infrastructure in Belize increases costs and causes delay 
in the transport of goods within the country and internationally to neighboring states. In addition, port 
capacity is also very limited with only one port operating in the country and at non-competitive prices, 
thus increasing costs to exporters. According to the Doing Business report, the estimated cost for 
exporting a container from Belize is higher than both the Latin America and Caribbean and OECD averages 
(respectively, $1,355; $1,299; and $1,080). In addition, firm-level data (ES 2011) reveal that 36.4 percent 
of enterprises identify electricity as a major constraint. Electricity rates for commercial and industrial 
enterprises range from USD 0.33 – 0.44, depending on consumption levels. These are considerably high, 
similar to the rates observed in the Caribbean, but higher than rates in Central American countries, which 
rely mostly on hydro sources. Agriculture sector representatives highlight that infrastructure deficiencies 
constrain investments in output growth and hamper the competitiveness of exports due to higher freight 
costs. Consultations with tour operators and other industry representatives indicate that the road 
infrastructure also impacts the growth of the industry. 

78. 
Reducing crime and v io lence can help in many ways , includ ing reducing costs , improving 
productiv ity, increas ing investments and u ltimately growth . The relationship between insecurity and 
development is complex, but in Belize’s recent history, the deterioration in crime rates have coincided 
with somewhat lackluster economic and social indicators. After a period of relatively rapid economic 
growth between 1998 and 2003, Belize’s GDP grew (only 3.1 percent in real terms from 2004 to 2012) 
barely above the 2.65 percent annual growth in the country’s population, with the result that GDP per 
capita has remained broadly unchanged in real terms since 2004. Unemployment , on the other hand, has 
increased from 8 to 14 percent in recent years (and even more among youth, 23 percent of whom are 
officially unemployed), while poverty increased from 33 percent in 2002 to 41 percent in 2009. 
Furthermore, over 60 percent of youth between 14 and 17 years old are not enrolled in school. I t would 
be important to continue focusing efforts to increase the costs to individuals from undertaking criminal 
activities. On the other hand, it is also essential to find ways to increase the benefits to them from 
engag ing in productive activities. This would require a concerted approach to create learning 
opportunities to steer vulnerable youth away from engag ing in crime and illicit activities.  

39 

 
 
C. INCLUS IVENESS 

79. 
The growth model in Belize, although based on popu lation growth , has not been inclus ive 
enough . Rapid population growth, including net migration from neighboring countries estimated at 7,596 
in 2012, 24 has been an important contributor to GDP growth, but also one of the factors behind stagnant 
per capita income and declining wealth.  For example, according to growth accounting results, labor has 
accounted for more than half of all GDP growth in Belize.  But with a population growth that exceeds 2.5% 
per annum, the country needs to grow faster in order for per capita income not to fall.  As seen in Figure 
31, unemployment has been high in Belize and migration is on the rise.  In addition, unemployment is 
considerably higher for women and workers born in Belize (16% in 2012) as opposed to those born abroad 
(8% in 2012). 25  In the presence of a growing supply of labor (with participation rates in excess of 80% for 
male workers and above 50% for female workers) and positive economic growth, one would expect 
different labor market outcomes, with lower levels of unemployment. This section presents a diagnostic 
of Belize’s welfare and labor market indicators, and of the degree of labor content and backward linkages 
of Belize’s exports, suggesting pathways that could boost shared prosperity in the country.  

80. 
In v iew o f the ev idence o f lackluster inclus iveness, th is chapter investigates the extent to which 
labor market outcomes , the ro le o f migration , the nature o f unemp loyment, and the limited existence 
o f backward -forward sectoral linkages p lay a part in the limited shared prosperity performance 
observed in Belize. We are interested in understanding , in particular, the extent to which endogenous 
factors such as labor market institutions, exemplified by high public sector wages that could, for example, 
lead to cueing in the public sector and contribute to a higher than expected unemployment rate.

Labor Market Outcomes Vary by Gender and Ethnicity 

81. Wh ile the private sector is the largest emp loyer in Belize, there is a lot o f variation in 
occupations along gender and ethnic d imens ions . More than half (54 percent) of the labor force worked 
in the private sector in 2014. This is substantially higher than the share of the economically active 
population working in the public sector (14%) or the self-employed (29%) and unpaid family workers (3%). 
While the differences in type of employment are not large, there is wide variation by ethnicity. For 
example, almost half of Mayans are self-employed which is very different from other groups. There is a 
lot of variation in occupational choice by gender and ethnicity. Most women (56 percent) worked as clerks, 
sales workers or in service occupations compared to only 24 percent of men with the same type of 
occupations in September 2014 (Figure 32, Panel A). Also, a larger proportion of women (22 percent) as 
compared to men (14 percent) worked as professionals. Furthermore, there are occupational differences 
by ethnicity with the Mayan minority working primarily as skilled agricultural workers, 45 percent of 
Creole working as clerks or sales workers, and 26 percent of the Garifuna working as managers, 
professionals or technicians – the highest proportion compared to other ethnicities (Figure 32, Panel B).

82. Migrants , representing a fifth o f the labor force, appear to fill a gap in the labor market and 
occupy mostly low skill jobs . Migration in the Caribbean basin is a common phenomenon. Belize is no 
exception – the country has been experiencing net inward migration since early 2000s. While 14.7 percent 
of Belizean population were foreign born, migrants represent approximately a fifth of the labor force. 
Migrants are coming to Belize mostly from Central America – 40 percent of born abroad are from 
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras (Lindauer (2014)).  Migrants tend to have a higher labor market 
participation rate (69%) than locals (65%), and the unemployment rate of foreign born was almost two 
times lower than that of locals – 8.2 percent and 16.2 percent respectively in 2014. As in many other 
countries, migrants tend to fill a gap in the labor market by taking up the low skilled jobs that the better-

41 

 
 
 
 
 
educated locals do not want to – 54 percent of employed migrants had below primary education 
compared to 42 percent of locals (Figure 33, Panel A).

Unemployment: Frictional and Structural 

83. 
Belize su ffers from a relatively h igh level o f unemp loyment for a country that has been growing 
above the reg ional average. Females and youth aged 14 to 24 are particularly likely to face employment 
challenges; 62% of the unemployed population are female and 43% are youth. The variation in 
unemployment rates is highly seasonal, reflecting frictional layoffs associated with the business cycle and 
typically reaching its high during the low tourism season (September) only to decline during peak tourism 
season (April). Since 2012 the unemployment rate has declined by 4 percentage points from 14.1 percent 
in 2012 to 9.9 percent in 2014 (Figure 34, Panel A).  The unemployment rate in Belize is much higher than 
the average unemployment rate in other LAC countries (6.2 percent in 2013) or upper middle income 
countries (5.9 percent in 2013). Furthermore, the majority of the unemployed stay unemployed for more 
than half of the year, e.g . 37.5 percent were unemployed between 7-12 months and 28.9 percent were 
unemployed for more than one year in September 2014. The income growth of the labor force has been 
extremely low: the nominal median monthly income per worker increased from BZ$ 694 in 2003 to BZ$ 
886 in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, median nominal earnings increased annually by 2.8 percent; real 
median earnings grew by a meager 0.9 percent per year (Lindauer (2014)). These trends suggest that 
declining economic growth had direct implications for labor demand which had been decreasing during 
2002-2012 with some signs of recovery thereafter.

84. 
Structural factors , such as a h igher participation rate for women and a rap id popu lation growth, 
help to exp lain why unemp loyment rates are h igh in Belize. Since early 2000s, the population of Belize 
has increased by 40 percent from 238,600 in 2000 to 331,900 inhabitants in 2013 (World Bank (2014)). 
The working age population has been continuously increasing from 63 percent in 2002 to 67 percent in 
2012 (Lindauer (2014)). While fertility rates have been declining – from 3.6 birth per woman in 2000 to 
2.7 birth per women in 2013 – they were much higher than in LAC overall – 2.6 in 2000 and 2.2 in 2013 – 
which has been contributing to population growth. Additionally, there was a slight increase in labor force 
participation from 62 in 2000 to 64 percent in 2014 (Figure 34, Panel B).   The increase in labor force 
participation has been primarily driven by women whose participation rates increased from 39.7 percent 
in 2000 to 48.5 percent in 2014. While overall this is a positive trend, it has not been accompanied by the 
availability of economic opportunities in terms of jobs which have not been created fast enough to absorb 
new labor market entrants. 

Are Workers Cue ing for Jobs in the Public Sector? 

85. 
Youth in Belize have better education outcomes than the rest o f the popu lation. Youth are 
somewhat more educated than the population at large; they are more than twice as likely to have 
completed primary education as other labor force participants (Naslund-Hadley et al. (2013)). As such, it 
is possible that they anticipate wage returns for their higher levels of education, which go unrealized. 
Conversely, employers may see youth as unwilling to work due to their higher reservation wages, or may 
perceive their inexperience as an indication of their lack of skill. 26 Natives’ reservation wages may reduce 

26 The I nter -Amer i can Development Bank’s case s tudy of the Bel traide training program inves tigates the potential 
for more ca refully ca librated s kill s i gnaling mecha nisms to a ddres s the nega ti ve perceptions of empl oyers. The 
Bel tra ide’s Business Process Outsourcing (BPO ) Training program i llustrates the va l ue of improving employability

their labor force participation, thereby creating higher demand for migrant labor. While the low or non-
existent wage returns on education may in part explain the discrepancy between natives expected wages 
and market wages, other determinants—namely inflated public sector wages—may play a role in 
increasing reservation wages, as well. Public sector wage inflation does appear to be a notable fiscal issue 
(IMF (2014b), and substantial evidence exists to suggest a non-neg lig ible wage differential between the 
private and public sectors, though data limitations prevent quantification of that differential (see Lafuente 
(2013)). Available data, however, suggests that this wage differential may not be the main determinant 
of natives’ unsupportable reservation wages.  

86. 
There is not enough ev idence to support the hypothes is that pub lic sector wage in flation’s 
affect in any s ign ificant way natives ’ reservation wages . First, the public sector employs only 14% of 
Belize’s labor force which makes it unlikely that the public sector plays an oversized role in determining 
natives’ wage expectations. Second, access to Belize’s public sector is reportedly transparent and merit-
based; thus, it is unlikely that natives would delay entry into the private sector to await informal access 
to public sector employment. Third, positions in the Belizean public sector generally require higher levels 
of education than those in the private sector; thus higher public wages may be more linked to higher skill 
levels than wage inflation, per se. Data limitations preclude conclusive findings on the impact of public 
wages on natives’ reservation wages and the resultant employment of foreigners. Nevertheless, g iven the 
evidence above, it is unlikely that public wage inflation is the main determinant of natives’ reservation 
wages. In view of this, improving educational quality and private sector skill recognition mechanisms may 
prove to be more effective interventions for addressing the reservation wage gap.

Over the past fifteen years , immigration has contributed s ign ificantly to popu lation growth and 
labor force growth . Belize is an emigrant sending country and, at the same time, one of the three main 
immigrant receiving countries in Central America. The country’s geographical location enhances the 
arrival and entry of immigrants from neighboring countries by sea, land or air. I t is attractive to immigrants 
from the reg ion due to a stable economic situation, higher living standards and job availability. As of 
2012,—the last year for which migration data is available—migrants comprised 20% of the working age 
population and 24% of the employed population. Guatemalans comprised over 10% of the labor force, 
while Salvadorans, Hondurans and Mexicans together accounted for another 6%. These migrants are not 
distributed equally across Belize; 60% are in the densely-populated districts of Cayo and Belize, and 
another 23% are in the sparsely-populated southern districts of Stann Creek and Toledo (Figure 35). 27  

88. 
Belize also receives migrants from outs ide the continent who come to work on the 
entertainment industry and other businesses . Extra-continental labor migrants are primarily temporary 
workers from India and Turkey employed in various casinos and business establishments within the 
Corozal Free Zone. In 2012, the majority (63.4%) were between the ages of 20- 39 years of age earning 
less than $179.99 Belize dollars weekly. Females earn substantially less. Permanent labor migrants also 
come from the Central American northern triang le although the US also contributes to the workforce.

China, India and Nigeria had the highest numbers of extra-continental permanent labor migrants. There 
are no specific programs to recruit workers or regulate working conditions of migrant workers.

Thi s s earch effec t could ea sily then contribute to i nc reasing the "na tural" rate of unemployment.  Traditionally

Al though a pl ausible hypothesis, thi s has not yet been tes ted proper l y for Bel ize. The a bs ence of pa nel data at

89. Migration to Belize is likely driven by a fairly even comb ination o f push and pu ll factors . Among 
the push factors are political instability, widespread gang-related violence and limited employment 
opportunities in prominent orig in countries. Several pull factors likely attract migrants to Belize. First and 
foremost, increased stability and security facilitate more consistent employment in Belize. Second, 
Belize’s proximity and relatively porous borders minimize transaction costs for aspiring migrants, 
especially from adjacent Guatemala. This pull factor manifests in an over-representation of migrants in 
the Belizean district bordering Guatemala. Third, poor land management institutions in Belize enable 
arriving migrants to install themselves on unclaimed land and engage in small-scale agricultural 
production or micro-enterprises. Fourth, Belize has a GDP per capita significantly higher than that of any 
major orig in country, facilitating an improved standard of living for migrants. Belize also has a history of 
being an important transit country for migrants headed to the United States, which may have helped 
initiate migration flows. Though transit to the United States from Belize has become prohibitively difficult 
for undocumented migrants, potential wage differentials, increased security, and widespread opportunity 
have continued to attract migrants from neighboring countries.   

90. 
On the other hand , deteriorating economic cond itions such as h igh levels o f unemp loyment as 
well as lack o f prospects for h igh ly-educated workers are probably stimu lating migratory movements 
o f Belizeans towards the USA, Canada and the Un ited Kingdom (UK). In 2011, for example, the number 
of Belizeans residing in major US cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Miami had reached 
well over 45,000 representing almost 15% of the estimated population of Belize (IOM (2013)). Although 
dated, the information available suggests that those who emigrate are usually among the most educated 
in the country. In the 2000 Census of Belize, 47% of Belizeans emigrants reported having a high school 

46 

 
 
degree or higher. Data from the US Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey (ACS), the 2000 
Census, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) reports as much 
as 87.1% of Belizeans adults age 25 and older who were residing in the US had a high school education or 
higher. The fact that a relative high proportion of Belizeans emigrants possesses a higher level of 
education, may be indicative of a trend that many Belizeans who emigrate for study reasons decide to 
remain abroad after completing their studies instead of returning home. Belize has only had a national 
university since the year 2000; master degree programs, however, are not yet being offered. The findings 
highlighted the fact that the country was exporting its most valuable human resource. I t is obvious that 
this brain drain affects the Belizean labor pool and can lead to a less robust social security system as well 
as possible future spikes in the need for immigrant workers.  

91. 
The comb ination o f substantial levels o f labor migration and moderately h igh levels o f 
unemp loyment has generated several questions about the effect o f migration on Belize’s development, 
particu larly natives ’ emp loyment. This section addresses three key queries about this relationship: 

1. What role do migrants play in the Belizean economy? 
2. What role do migrants play in natives’ unemployment? 
3. Could migration play any other role in Belize’s economic development at this moment? 

a. Migrants May Support Competitiveness in Low-Wage Sectors 

92. 
For a small country with a limited stock o f labor, migrant work can be a so lution rather than a 
prob lem. Data on employment by industry and workers’ country of birth is unavailable, but anecdotal 
evidence suggests that Central American migrants’ employment is concentrated in three areas: low-wage 
services in urban areas, self-employment, and agricultural production (primarily citrus cultivation and 
processing). Particularly in the districts of Cayo and Belize, migrants likely fill service positions that many 
Belizeans, particularly young Belizeans, are unwilling to fill. In the tourism and the citrus industries, the 
probable lower reservation wages of Central American workers may have sustained competitiveness, 
especially as these industries strugg led to recover following Hurricane Dean in 2007. The citrus industry, 
in particular, faces stiff competition from much larger US and Braz ilian producers, but is often the most 
significant element of Belize’s agricultural sector. The ability of producers to rely on foreign workers may 
provide this industry with a cushion against price shocks. More fieldwork would be necessary to confirm 
this hypothesis. 

b. Natives’ Unemployment Is Not A D irect Result of Migrant Employment 

93. 
In the face o f worrisome unemp loyment levels , particu larly among Belizean youth , the 
conclus ion that migrant emp loyment is to b lame is a tempting one. Ev idence to fu lly support this 
conclus ion , however, is relatively poor. The relationship between unemployment and employment of 
migrants by district is weak or non-existent (Figure 36). While the district with the highest proportion of 
migrants also has the highest level of unemployment, nearly half of all unemployed in this district were 
between the ages of 14-24. Given the suspected higher reservation wages of this cohort, it is just as likely 
that migrants flocked to this reg ion in response to unfilled labor demand, particularly in the lowest-wage 

47 

 
occupations. The higher than average level of self-employment (28%) in this district may reflect migrant 
micro-enterprises, so saturation of the private sector by migrants remains debatable. This argument is 
further bolstered by the lack of evidence that inflated wage differentials between public and private sector 
jobs raise the reservation wage of native Belizean youth, who could be holding out for a comfortable 
public sector career opportunity.

94. Wh ile migrants may in some scenarios undercut native wage min imums , thereby contributing 
to native unemp loyment, insu fficient job creation and non -existent skill premiums are much more 
serious drivers o f unemp loyment. Between 2000 and 2012, the number of migrants in the labor force 
increased by around 13,500, or 70%. Over the same time period, the number of jobs increased by 76,500, 
or 107%. 28 This led to an overall decrease in natives’ unemployment, but was still insufficient to provide 
jobs for the youth being rapidly added to the labor force. The need for increased job creation is linked to 
the need for a stronger continuum of jobs that recognize and value skill development. Extremely low 
returns to education reflect immature industries that cannot make use of workers’ skills, as well as skill 
acquisition poorly-aligned with labor market needs. Addressing these challenges through stronger training 
mechanisms would fuel job creation while fostering labor market competition around skills rather than 
low wages. These structural labor market issues underpin Belize’s unemployment challenges, which 
appear generally unrelated to migration.

c. Migrants Will Likely Continue To Fill Low-Skill Positions 

95. Migrants are a comp lement to the local labor force rather than substitutes. Because they 
generally do not speak Eng lish and have low levels of educational attainment, migrants are probably not 
working in sectors that require significant skills. Except through long-term labor market participation, 
which may facilitate skill acquisition in select industries, migrants will probably not be able to acquire the 
select skills that would grant them access to the extremely small skilled labor market in Belize. Future 
migrants will probably feature similar skill profiles to those that have entered Belize over the past decade. 
More restrictive migration regulations that required higher skill levels, if enforceable, would probably 
result in a de facto ban on immigration; skilled workers do not seem to be trying to access the Belizean 
labor market. 

Box 4 : Potent ial Responses to Migrat ion and Unemployment Phenomenon 

Bel i ze’s potential policy responses to mi gration are l imited by poor enforcement capacity on s everal fronts. If 
the government s ought to restr ict mi grant employment i n a n effor t to i nc rease natives’ empl oyment, several 
i ns titutions would need to be s i gnificantly s trengthened. Fi rst, border control between Bel i ze, Gua temala, and 
Mex i co i s notoriously l ax , a nd di fficult due to the ter ra i n. Bolster ing mi gration ma nagement capacity would 
requi re not onl y i nfrastructure i nvestments i n physical border control, but a l so s enior-level dec ision-making 
a round res i dence a nd c i ti zens hi p regul a ti ons , whi ch a re cur rentl y fa i r l y generous , when enforced.  

I t i s not c lea r that reducing immigration fl ows to Bel ize is the r i ght a pproach. What would be best i s perhaps 
improving l and management capacity which in its cur rent form s eems to encourage mi grants (a nd natives) to

Labor Content of Exports and Sector Linkages 

96. 
Exports have been an important generator – and driver – o f wage and emp loyment growth in 
Belize s ince 2007. Indirect exports – that is, domestic inputs of exports – have been more important for 
wage growth than direct exports. In Belize the wages paid to directly produce exports have been 
increasing robustly since 2001. The LACEX data 29 shows that the labor value added (in nominal terms) 

29 The LACEX da ta s et ha s been recentl y a ssembled to compute the (di rec t a nd i ndirect) va lue of the compensation 
of empl oyees l inked to expor ts for ea ch sec tor/country/year (Calì et a l. (2015)). The da ta has been computed on the 

49 

 
                                                             
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly contained in exports achieved an average annual growth rate of 5.6 percent between 2004 and 
2011, reaching $235.8 million. The growth in all the wages paid to produce exports once including those 
for the domestic inputs of exports has been more rapid.  The total labor value added in exports achieved 
an average annual growth rate of 7.3 percent between 2004 and 2011, reaching $370 million. 

97. 
Trade and transport serv ices is the sector with the h ighest labor content in exports , but 
maintains few backward linkages with domestic supp liers in the Belize economy . With $94 million in 
2011, trade and transport is by far the largest contributor to wages among export sectors (Figure 37), 
reflecting the large value of gross exports and a relatively high labor content in exports. This result is not 
surprising , g iven that this sector includes services directly related to tourism, including hotels and 
restaurants, and other auxiliary tourism services, including activities of travel agencies. What is surprising , 
however, is the share of the sector’s labor content explained not by domestic backward linkages but by 
direct exports. For example, only around one tenth of the total labor contained in exports of trade and 
transport is due to labor used by domestic suppliers of this sector – primarily from other private services. 
This suggests little interconnectedness with domestic suppliers outside trade and transport services, and 
that growth in tourism does not necessarily pull other sectors of the economy along with it. 

98. 
Agricu lture, forestry and fisheries and processed foods instead have stronger backward linkages 
with domestic supp liers in other sectors o f the economy. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries and 
processed foods are also important sectors for generating labor compensation through their exports, with 
$82 million and $49 million in 2011, respectively. This is achieved both directly within the sector, and also 
indirectly from other sectors supplying inputs. Both agriculture, forestry and fisheries and processed foods 
rely heavily on trade and transport services (77 percent and 62 percent of domestically supplied inputs 
are of trade and transport services, respectively). Processed foods receives 27 percent of domestically 
supplied inputs from the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector, while agriculture, forestry and fisheries 
receives 14 percent of domestically supplied inputs from other private services. Domestic linkages with 
other sectors, however, are nascent. 

99. 
Non -agricu ltural based manu facturing – includ ing transport equ ipment and mach inery and 
equ ipment 30 – generate labor compensation through their exports ind irectly , with very little d irect 
contribution. Looking at Belize’s exports, in 2011 the country’s main exports of machinery and equipment 
included manufacture of other special purpose machinery (ISIC rev. 3 code 2929) and manufacture of 
instruments and appliances for measuring , checking , testing , navigating and other purposes (ISIC rev. 3 
code 3312). The analysis may be capturing re-exports of these products, where little transformation is

happening between importation and exportation, explaining the low direct contribution. Similarly, 
however, it is labor in services sectors – in particular trade and transport and other private services – that 
benefit from expansion of non-agricultural based manufacturing exports. Nevertheless, the results 
suggests that even if manufacturing exports generate little direct domestic value added, it still generated 
labor-enhancing outcomes due to the backward linkages with services sectors, which are labor intensive 
and important for export.

Although creating few backward linkages, trade and transport serv ices is an important sector 
for producing inputs for other export sectors . Figure 38 shows the counterpart of Figure 37, or how much 
the labor in each sector is used by the other exporting sectors (i.e. the forward linkages). As is typical of 
many economies, labor in the services sectors are the most important contributor to exports once 
accounting for the forward linkages. Trade and transport services pay over $160 million in wages, more 
than half of which is paid by supplying services to other export sectors. What is atypical of many 
economies, however, is the very low forward linkages that all other sectors generate in Belize, where labor 
is not employed to produce inputs for other exporting sectors. This suggests very limited downstream 
connectivity between sectors of Belize’s economy. 

101. 
There are weak forward linkages o f agricu lture and processed foods with tourism activ ities. 
Inputs from agriculture, forestry and fisheries and processed foods represent less than 1 percent of trade 
and transport’s total labor content of exports (or 10 percent and 8 percent of all labor value added inputs, 

51 

 
 
 
respectively). Together with the low backward linkages of tourism, these results suggests room for policy 
to foment usage of domestically produced food as well as other sectors by tourism.

Export Growth Could Boost Shared Prosperity 

102. 
Exports o f trade and transport serv ices are more labor intens ive than other important export 
sectors for Belize, suggesting export growth in th is sector or other sectors that use these inputs 
intens ively wou ld have pos itive income effects in favor o f labor. Figure 39 shows how the labor intensity 
of Belize’s gross exports varies across sectors as well as in comparison to other Central American 
economies. In general, Belize has an average share of labor in exports that is larger than its comparators, 
but there is substantial variation across sectors. For example each $100 of trade and transport services 
exports generates $43 of wages, of which $40 go the workers directly producing these services. This is 
higher than in Costa R ica, Panama, El Salvador and Honduras. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries ($33), 
processed foods ($30), other private services ($40), transport equipment ($24), and machinery and 
equipment ($33) all pay less to labor per $100 of exports.

103. 
Relatively low wages for agricu ltural exporters , and low linkages of trade and transport serv ices, 
may be symptoms o f labor market d istortions . Figure 40 explores how the labor intensity of five 
important export sectors has evolved between 2004 and 2011 and in comparison to other Central 
American economies: trade and transport services; agriculture, forestry and fisheries; processed foods; 
machinery and equipment; and energy extraction. A cross-country comparison of the direct and indirect 
labor intensity of exports can help pinpoint room for policy. The direct value added contribution of 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, for example, pay much lower wages per $100 of gross exports than in 
other Central American countries. At the same time, the labor content in agriculture, forestry and fisheries 
gross exports have also become relatively more reliant on input sectors in Belize.  One explanation would 
be low and declining wages in the sector relatively to peer countries, suggesting possible distortions in 
Belize’s labor market (such as mismatches in the demand and supply of labor, or poor quality of labor 
skills) or that the sector is highly capital intensive. The low backward linkages of trade and transport 
services relative to peer countries suggests room to grow the linkages with domestic suppliers, which may 
be prevented currently by a weak supporting industry. Not surprising ly, energy extraction provides little 
direct, backward or forward returns to labor overall and when compared to reg ional peers.

Like other Central American countries , Belize’s exports rely more heav ily on unskilled than 
skilled labor, suggesting export growth cou ld have red istributive income effects in favor o f unskilled 
labor. Figure 41 splits the total labor content of exports for 2004 and 2011 into skilled and unskilled 
labor. 31 The latter dominates in these countries to a larger extent than in the rest of the world, although 
Belize has a slightly higher share of skilled labor in exports than its comparators with the exception of 
Panama. And similar to all comparators, the share of labor content of exports going to skilled versus 
unskilled workers has remained constant between 2004 and 2011: 22 percent versus 21 percent.

The reliance on unskilled labor is cons istent across export sectors in Belize, with the exception 
o f pub lic serv ices . While the unskilled component continues to be larger in most sectors, there is some 
cross-sectoral variation (Figure 42). Most notably, public administration, health and defense use much 
more skilled labor than other sectors of the economy. This trend is true though to a lesser extent for other 
private services, but trade and transport services are also important employers of skilled labor in Belize. 
For these sectors, the split is even or almost even (either when considering total value added computed 
through the backward or forward linkages method), and is consistent with evidence from other countries 
in the world. At the other extreme, agriculture, forestry and fishing have the lowest shares of skilled labor 
contained in total exports, such that growing these exports may be important for achieving shared 
prosperity in the country.

Policy Areas to Boost Inclusion 

106. 
S ign ificant skill deficits in the labor force represent an important constraint to greater 
inclus iveness in Belize. As discussed in other sections of this SCD , limitations in the quality of education 
and their implications on the skills profile of the workforce are worrisome. As a practical example, 
policymakers’ efforts to transform the country’s Ang lophone population into a premiere call center 
workforce have heretofore been thwarted by the lack of eng ineering , IT and customer skills in the labor 
force (Lindauer (2014)). While employers point to skill deficits as a barrier to growth, returns to 
education—in wages and chances of employment, generally—appear abysmally low. Unemployed and 
employed Belizeans were just as likely to not have completed any education (Figure 43). Our analysis 
shows that unemployment rates are particularly high for those with primary education (15.1 percent) and 
below primary (10.7 percent) as compared to those with tertiary education (5.0 percent) in September 
2014. There is also evidence of positive returns to education only at the secondary level. Naslund-Hadley 
et al. (2013), for example, have found that the return to primary education (which over 80 percent of 
youth complete) was not significantly different from no education at all, and that the return to secondary 
education was only 3.2% compared to no education in 2009. Taken together, these results suggest that 
primary and secondary education are not producing skills valued by the labor market, as few jobs require 
and reward basic education. On the other hand, returns to vocational education were 11.3% and returns 
to university education were 14.6%, suggesting that the demand for high skilled workers and workers with 
job specific skills was high. Focus group discussions with employers show that the education system is not 
producing graduates with either basic or practical or business related skills. Additionally, work ethic and 
honesty present a challenge, especially for potential growth industries such as call centers, indicating that 
socio-emotional skills are also not being sufficiently built in school (Lindauer (2014)).  Investing in 
education and vocational training can have quick and lasting effects on the employability of the local 
population and contribute to increase inclusiveness in Belize.

Po licies that succeed in improv ing educational outcomes and create train ing opportunities in 
techn ical skills cou ld also be optimal in address ing concerns on the migration front. Rather than 
investing in developing sophisticated migration systems, Belize may benefit more from the development 
of vocational training programs calibrated to meet the needs of the domestic labor market. I f these 
training programs increase the wage premium for skills in the private sector and effectively signal workers’ 
skills to employers, they may lead to increases in native employment such that migrants serve as 
complements rather than substitutes to natives in the labor market. Regardless of the speed of this 
potential transition, investments in skill development and private sector growth would appear to be more 
effective policy responses to unemployment than a more rigorous, unenforceable migration policy. 

108 . 

Belize needs a migration management strategy wh ich can in form the development o f a 
comprehens ive national migration po licy . According to the CIA and the IOM, more recently, Belize has 
become a transit point for drugs, arms, victims of human trafficking , traffickers in persons, smugg lers, 
criminals and organized crime. This represents major challenges for national authorities who must 
respond to these activities within a context where material resources and technical capacities (software, 
equipment, technology and appropriate facilities) are limited. There is difficulty in establishing a 
coordinated response to administer the existing immigrant stock, and deal with the increasing temporary, 
permanent, regular and irregular migration. Additionally, the lack of adequate migration policies (strategy 
and planning) constrains the proper management of migration. Belize will continue to be a migrant 
sending and migrant receiving country and as a result of its strateg ic location it will continue to experience 
mixed flows. Therefore, it is important that while establishing a migration policy to deal with the sustained 
flows it must also consider that the immigrant stock in Belize is mature and well integrated. This means 
that the best move towards manag ing Belizean migration in Belize must be done from a holistic position. 

109. 
There is a clear ro le for po licy in ensuring the competitiveness o f Belize’s serv ices sector. A 
competitive domestic services sector is necessary for competitiveness of manufacturing and agricultural 
exports. This is exemplified by the importance of services – in particular trade and transport services and 
other private services – as labor inputs for sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fishers, processed 
foods, and machinery and equipment. This is particularly relevant for g lobal-value-chain-oriented sectors 
that may import foreign inputs and rely heavily on labor and services as domestic inputs. The government 
should look to reduce regulatory policies that act as barriers to services provision, both domestically and 
by international services suppliers. 

110. 
Finally , the government should seek po licies to enhance the backward linkages between 
tourism and other sectors including agricu lture and processed foods. The low backward linkages of trade 
and transport services relative to peer countries suggests room to grow the linkages with domestic 
suppliers, which may be prevented currently by a weak supporting industry. This includes policies to 
strengthen the linkages with sectors including agricultural or processed food inputs, growth of which 
would simultaneously support shared prosperity. Caution is warranted, however, not to put in place 
policies that act as anti-import biases, which would raise agricultural prices in Belize and harm poorer 
populations outside the agricultural sector.

D. SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES 

111. 
The sustainab ility o f growth and the ab ility to boost shared prosperity in Belize cou ld be 
affected by po licy cho ices and inadequate exp loration o f natural riches . For a small and sparsely 
populated country that relies so much on its natural beauty as an eng ine of growth, it is hard to 
disentang le the effects of policies that could affect separately economic, environmental and social 
sustainability. Without carefully weighing the costs and benefits of any g iven growth enhancing 
investment opportunity, one could at the same time affect social and environmental sustainability, as 
illustrated by the current debate on offshore oil drilling in Belize. With that caveat in mind, the main 
factors that could pose sustainability challenges to growth, the environmental and inclusiveness are 
reviewed next. 

Factors that May Affect the Sustainability of Growth  

112. Growth in Belize can be susceptib le to the path o f debt, exogenous shocks that could heighten 
vo latility , and the depletion of resources availab le for investments . Recent decisions to nationalize utility 
companies that had been privatized in the past could limit future growth prospects via an increase in the 
size of public debt that could become unsustainable. At the same time, exposure to terms of trade shocks 
could affect growth performance through an increase in output volatility, whereas the incidence of high-
impact natural disasters and the depletion of natural resources could affect net savings negatively and 
have a deleterious effect on growth. 

Nationalizations and Debt  

113. 
Po licy decis ions taken in 2009 and 2011 to nationalize the telecommunications and electricity 
compan ies have not yet been compensated and could have an impact on the sustainab ility o f debt and 
growth in Belize.  Background analysis for this SCD has assessed the possible impacts of compensation 
payments for the nationalized companies and the possible implications of this on growth and debt 
sustainability. This analysis starts with the development of a baseline for the main macroeconomic 
aggregates of the Belizean economy over the next 15 years that was then used to compare the impacts 
of different options for compensation payments and their financing . In the baseline scenario, medium-
term economic growth is estimated at 2.5 percent per year (see Table 7). A primary government surplus 
of 1-1.2 percent of GDP would allow the public debt-to-GDP ratio to fall slowly from 75 percent of GDP in 
2015 to 70 percent in 2028. Growth in non-oil exports would compensate for the fall in oil exports due to 
lower prices from 2015 onwards and diminishing production from ag ing wells. However, import growth is 
likely to exceed export growth resulting in an expanding current account deficit and increasing foreign 
borrowing by the private sector. FD I is projected to grow more slowly than Belizean GDP. Belize’s fixed 
exchange rate would lead to convergence with US inflation (see Table 7). This baseline scenario provides 
a neutral backdrop to discuss debt sustainability implications of compensation payments. By design, it 
shows the economy in a low-equilibrium growth path, in which most of the macroeconomic aggregates 
remain stable, including the fiscal and current account balance.

Poss ib le scenarios for compensation payments and their financing suggest that Belize could face 
a h igh risk o f debt d istress . Taking the mid-point of the competing claims for simplicity, the Belizean 
government may have to pay the former owners about US$182 million, plus accrued interest for the 
period between nationalization and the payment of compensations. For presentational purposes, we 
assume that the liability for the compensations is reflected in the balance sheets of the two companies 
since nationalization occurred, rather than in the government’s balance sheet. This means government 
debt will be affected only when the government makes payments to the former owners. These payments 
are treated as transfers to the companies, which then transfer the money abroad to the former owners 
in the form of equity outflow. To present the effect of the compensation payments more clearly, we treat 
them as completely additional: interest payments are capitalized, i.e. the Belizean government borrows 
every year additional funds to pay for interest on new debt, while principal payments are rolled over when 
they come due. 

59 

 
 
115. 
The scenarios h igh light the great challenge facing Belize shou ld the courts decide on 
compensation payments s imilar to those s imu lated here. The scenarios have in common a precariously 
slow debt reduction profile with a high risk of debt distress (Figure 44). Sensitivity analysis suggest that a 
real interest rate of more than 6.5 percent on foreign debt, or GDP growth of less than 2 percent per year 
would lead to an unsustainable debt spiral. Domestic financing of the compensations does not provide 
the foreign exchange needed to transfer payments to the former owners, and a draw-down of reserves 
would leave the central bank dangerously exposed to shocks and speculative attacks. Contractionary fiscal 
policy leading to a higher primary surplus could contribute to a faster reduction in debt burden, as long 
as GDP growth could be maintained at 2.5 percent. Policies to spur faster growth would also reduce the 
debt burden.

Notes: The central scenarios are developed using a real interest rate of 4.5 percent for external debt, and 3 percent for domesti c 
debt. For simplicity , we assume that interest accrued for 4 years after the nationalizations before compensation payments are 
made at the (nominal) external debt interest rate of 6 percent. Interest amounts to US$48 million, for a total of US$230 millio n 
or 14 percent of 2014 GDP in compensation payments. The scenarios are the following : Scenar io 1: Foreign-finance d 
instalments. The government of Belize pay s compensations with a net present v alue of US$230 million in equal yearly 
instalments of US$54 million over a period of five years starting in 2016. The outstanding debt continues to accrue interest at 
6 percent per year. The government raises external commercial debt to fund compensations. External commercial debt carrie s 
an interest rate of 6 percent per year. Scenar io 2: Domestically financed instalments. Same as above, but the government 
issues domestic debt to fund compensations. Conversion of compensations into foreign currency for transfer abroad reduces 
central bank reserves. Scenar io 3: Foreign-financed one-off payment. The government of Belize pay s compensations in one 
payment in 2016 with external commercial financing ; one-time transfers to the former owners are made by the companies. 
Scenar io 4: Domestically financed one-off payment. Same as above but payments are made with domestic financing and 
reserve draw-down. Source: Bank staff estimates.

116. 
The use o f funds already set as ide for the compensation and proceeds from re -privatization of 
a majority ownersh ip share cou ld also be feas ib le options . D ividend payments on the remaining 
government share would contribute to debt service payments. In this scenario, the government would 
need a foreign-exchange bridge loan to avoid a risky depletion of central bank reserves: the US$90 million 
set aside for compensation payments are in Belizean dollars and would have to be converted into foreign 
exchange by the central bank, and the sales proceeds may materialize with some delay after 
compensations have been paid. For illustrative purposes, we have simulated such a scenario as well. We 
assume a bridge loan covers the entire compensation payments made over 5 years starting in 2016. The 
loan carries a real interest rate of 4.5%. The government sells a majority stake in the companies for US$50 
million in 2021, which it uses to retire outstanding debt. In this more realistic scenario, the government 
would use the US$90 million set aside for compensation payments to retire domestic debt, while paying 
the actual compensations out of new foreign debt. Overall government debt would increase to 78% of 
GDP in 2020. Sales proceeds from re-privatization would reduce this ratio to 75% in 2021, followed by a 
gradual reduction to 71.5% in 2028. I f the companies could generate foreign exchange dividends, they 
could contribute to a faster decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. 

117. 
Above and beyond these illustrative scenarios, what is certain is that Belize will need to undergo 
a process o f fiscal conso lidation to create bu ffers to pay these compensations . The country has stopped 
generating the fiscal surpluses that it used to enjoy a few years back and is now expected to move into 
deficit territory over the medium term. There are growing pressures on the expenditure side with a major 
boost to the wage bill coming from recent wage agreements that should raise the cost of salaries paid to 
public servants from 11 to 15% of GDP. Growth is expected to pick up and reach close to 3% this year and 
the next boosted by a new sugar plant, but should return to the normal trend of 2% after 2016 in the 
absence of new major investment projects. Given that the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase as 
the result of the nationalizations, one should expect higher debt service payments in the future. 
Depending on the terms of the compensations, as discussed above, some upfront cash payments of 
principal debt will need to be made in the short term and these could be significant. To avoid a sharp drop 
in international reserves, the authorities will need to consider some fiscal tightening to start building fiscal 
buffers that would allow them to pay the compensations.  

High Output Vo latility 

118. 
The h igh vo latility o f growth in Belize cou ld also have a negative effect on the growth trajectory 
and shared prosperity . Work by Ramey and Ramey (1995), Hnatkovska and Loayza (2005) and Breen and 
Garcia-Penalosa (2005) shows that the link between volatility and growth, to a large extent, is driven by 
the level of economic development with the negative effects of volatility being more pronounced in low-
income countries. Gavin and Hausmann (1996) have shown that Latin American economies are both much 
more volatile and much more unequal than industrial economies, and that in fact volatility of the level of 
GDP is positively correlated with inequality. Standard measures of output volatility rank Belize as one of 
the most volatile countries in the world. Output volatility, as measured by the standard deviation of real 
GDP growth, has been high and fairly persistent in Belize. With an average of 4.3% per decade, the 
standard deviation of growth in Belize has been among the highest in the reg ion since the 1970s (see 

61 

 
Table 8). Although some peer countries in LAC have experienced similar average standard deviations in 
the last four decades, much of this performance results from a rapidly declining trend in volatility of 
growth from high values in the 70s (e.g . the Bahamas, Chile, Dominica, Jamaica, Nicaragua, inter alia). 
Conversely, Belize’s standard deviation of growth has remained high throughout, illustrating the 
persistent nature of volatility of growth in the country (Figure 45). Relative to other middle income 
countries, the standard deviation of Belize’s annual growth has been more than double the average 
standard deviation of these countries (Figure 46). 

119. Much o f the vo latility in growth has been attributed to poor fiscal d iscip line, susceptib ility to 
natural d isasters , terms o f trade shocks 32 and relatively weak institutions . Using a variance 
decomposition exercise aimed at identifying which major sector of the economy contributes the most to 
the country’s growth volatility, Longmore et al. (2015) have shown that some 50 percent of that volatility 
can be attributed to covariate terms between the tertiary sector and agriculture, industry, and taxes.  In 
fact, the primary and secondary sectors of the economy account for only 2.4% and 3.3% of the variance 
in GDP growth, respectively. Although the difference between each sector’s contributions to GDP variance 
is large, it come as little surprise g iven that Belize’s service sector has become the largest contributor to 
GDP. Within the tertiary sector of the economy, financial services emerged as one of the main drivers, 
accounting for nearly 10% of volatility. The second and third highest contributions comes from 
transportation/communications and wholesale services at a level of 4.7% and 4.3%, respectively.

120. On the expend iture s ide, vo latility o f growth in Belize is mostly attributed to exports , wh ich 
account for 43.8% o f total output vo latility . The second largest contributor is private consumption, 
accounting for 37.3 percent, followed by imports at 17.6 percent, investment at 2.6 percent, and public 
consumption at 2.3 percent. A positive shock to trading partner’s GDP results in higher growth and the

accumulated impact seems to be pronounced and permanent. Given the structure of the economy this 
effect is likely to take place through the external sector channel, in particular through increased tourism 
demand as well higher merchandise exports – both of which have the potential to raise the level of 
domestic demand.  Consistent with the work of Judson and Orphanides (1999), the analysis in Longmore 
et al. (2015) also finds that a positive domestic price shock leads to a decline in output. As the price of 
goods increase in the economy, consumers quickly switch to cheaper imports either from neighboring 
Mexico or the USA. With a fixed exchange rate reg ime, shock to prices follows a long memory process 
which suggests that the falloff in output will have some amount of permanence as the economy loses 
external competiveness. There does appear to be some amount of procyclicality where a positive shock 
to government expenditure leads to a short-lived spike in output.  

121. Overall, the resu lts suggest that h igher output vo latility is less des irab le than lower output 
vo latility to maintain a h igh growth trajectory . When the economy is experiencing extreme bouts of 
volatility, trading partners’ GDP loses some of its ability to influence domestic activities. This is further 
compounded by the negative effects of inflation, which tends to become more pronounced during these 
episodes. These results have a number of policy implications. First, a strong track record of 
macroeconomic stability will be crucial for raising and sustaining the level of economic growth in Belize.  
With domestic stability assured, the country has a better chance of reaping the benefits of positive shocks 
orig inating from its major trading partners. While the economy is currently on the path to recovery from 
the recent g lobal financial crisis, the external and internal deficits will continue to put pressure on 
macroeconomic conditions, suggesting that additional measures to accelerate the pace of reform will be 
necessary to prevent a long-term fall in standards of living . Second, with the impact of trading partner’s 
GDP weakening during periods of intense volatility, the authorities will have to invest in developing 
countercyclical measures to minimize the duration of bouts of volatility. Further, fiscal policy, as practiced 
in the past is not a good option g iven the limited impact on boosting output.   Finally, the benefits to be 
derived from reducing the level of economic volatility in Belize is quite significant potentially leading to a 
higher level of growth. 

Dep letion o f Resources Availab le for Investments 

122. 
An assessment o f Belize’s Ad justed Net Sav ings shows that the country is currently facing a 
s ign ificant dep letion o f its assets and consequently a gradual decline in the total resources availab le for 
investment. Figure 47 shows the calculation of ANS for Belize in 2013, where gross national saving is 10.5 
percent of GNI .  After adjusting for the consumption of fixed capital (minus 17.5 percent), education 
expenditures (plus 6.5 percent), depletion of natural resources (minus 5 percent), and pollution 
damages 33 (minus 0.5 percent), Belize’s adjusted net saving is about -6 percent of GNI . Belize’s savings 
trend over the past two decades is shown in Figure 46, where the line graphs compares the country’s 
gross national saving to its adjusted net saving from 1990 to 2013.  Looking first at the trend in GNS, 
Belize’s total resources available for investment have been gradually decreasing through these years, 

33 Pol l ution damages include ca rbon emissions a nd exposure to pa rticulate ma tter (PM2.5 ).   Due to mi s sing data 
for 2013 , the 2013 es timate for a ir pollution damages from PM2 .5 i s ga p-filled using Belize’s 2010 es timate.

stabiliz ing around 13 percent over the past five years.   Though ANS generally tracked the movement of 
GNS, it has dropped below or near zero since 2005.  This recent prolonged period of negative ANS suggests 
that Belize is not saving enough (both in gross national savings and in the formation of human capital) to 
offset the depletion of its assets – mainly the depreciation of physical capital and the depletion of its 
natural resources.

123. Wh ile there have been pos itive expend itures in education throughout the period , the 
consumption o f fixed cap ital and natural resource dep letion have become an important factor in 
exp lain ing the negative net sav ings after the year 2000. The bar graphs of Figure 48 further illuminate 
the underlying factors behind the ANS estimates over this time period, where the positive expenditures 
in education add to saving , and the consumption of fixed capital, natural resource depletion, and pollution 
damage reduce saving .  From 1990 to 2000, ANS almost equaled gross national saving because the 
consumption of fixed capital was mostly offset by education expenditure (i.e. , investment in human 
capital).  However the picture changes after year 2000, with a rise in the consumption of fixed capital as 
well natural resource depletion becoming a more prominent component in the late 2000s. For Belize, 
depletion of natural resources basically comprises the depletion of energy resources (i.e. , oil).  These 
factors, in addition to a low gross saving rate, pushed ANS negative in the most recent years despite 
relatively high levels of education expenditures (around 6 percent of GNI ). 

124. 
Belize does not seem to be sav ing enough to o ffset the depreciation and depletion o f its assets. 
Figure 49 compares savings trends of Belize to its reg ional and income group from 1990 to 2013.  The 
average for Latin America and the Caribbean was steady around 8 percent of GNI during this period, 
though dropping slightly in recent years.  The average for upper middle income countries has been slowly

rising during this time, from 12 percent in 1990 to 19 percent in 2013.  As a sharp contrast to these 
aggregate trends, Belize’s ANS was much higher in the 1990s but drastically dropped lower and negative 
over the past 10 years.  This recent trend serves as a warning signal to Belize’s economy that it is not 
saving enough each year to offset the depreciation and depletion of its assets.

Factors that May Affect Environmental Sustainability 

Env ironmental sustainab ility in Belize invo lves enhancing res ilience against climate change and natural 
hazards , improv ing the quality o f in frastructure, and adopting wise po licy cho ices . As in many other 
Caribbean nations, the impacts of climate change can be severe to Belize’s natural resources. In addition, 
the exposure to natural hazards can affect not only natural riches but also destroy and damage weak 
infrastructure. In addition, there are non-neg lig ible risks associated with offshore oil drilling that could 
have catastrophic effects on Belize’s ecosystems with negative spillovers on tourism and fisheries, two 
important eng ines of growth. 

Vu lnerab ility to Climate Change and Natural Disasters 

125. 
The largest Barrier Reef in the occident, the greatest water availab ility per cap ita in Latin 
America, and the presence o f vast trop ical forests covering more than half o f its territory illustrate 
Belize’s natural resource wealth and b iod ivers ity. Relying on these characteristics, Belize has developed 
an export economy centered on tourism and natural resources (from petroleum to marine products). In 
that context, a substantial part of the population depends heavily on fisheries and traditional agriculture. 
Environmental governance in Belize is based on a wide range of national leg islation, multilateral 
environmental agreements, and both governmental and nongovernmental institutions. However, gaps in 
this governance represent an obstacle to sound environmental management in the country (see Figure 
50). The main constraints are a lack of coordination and resources, antiquated laws that fail to address 

66 

 
 
today’s challenges properly, ambitious policies and regulations that are developed but never enacted, and 
the absence of a land use policy as well as a unique authority responsible for water resources management 
(see Martin and Manzano (2010)).

126. 
In add ition , the h istory o f Belize has , in large part, been shaped by its vu lnerab ility to natural 
d isasters . Belize has experienced frequent natural disasters of catastrophic proportions over the last half 
century. Hurricane Hattie destroyed half of Belize City in 1961, killing 400 people and submerg ing Turneffe 
Island and Caulker Caye in 13-feet storm surges. The economic damages estimated at over 600% of GDP 
prompted the Government of Belize to build a new administrative capital 50 miles inland in Belmopan. 34 
In 2000, Hurricane Keith caused damages exceeding 45% of GDP, and one year later Hurricane Iris 
submerged Belize City in 14-feet storm surges and destroyed about 4,000 homes. Tropical Storm Arthur 
in May 2008 caused extensive damages to critical infrastructure and the agriculture sector (World Bank 
(2011a), (2011b)). An average of 3.3% of GDP was lost annually between 1993 and 2012 from disasters 
(see Figure 51). The fiscal impacts of disasters required significant capital expenditures to repair and 
reconstruct damaged infrastructure, resulting in increased debt, large budgetary deficits and unreliable 
funding streams, which collectively can limit sound macro-economic growth.

127. 
Belize’s vu lnerab ility to natural d isasters is exacerbated by the effects o f climate change, as 
natural hazards are expected to intensify both in terms o f frequency and severity. The United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change identified Belize as one of the countries that is most vulnerable 
to the adverse impacts of climate change. More than 50% of the population and business centers are on 
or near the long low lying coastline, most of which is at or near sea-level. The Belizean economy is highly 
sensitive to climate variability due to its dependence on natural resources. Projections suggest that 
frequent heat waves and droughts are expected, including high intensity rainfalls, and rising sea levels, 
which would lead to increased storm surges and riverine flooding .  

128. 
In the face o f Belize’s d isaster risk pro file, common practices to reduce vu lnerab ility can include 
the adoption o f non -structural (e.g. bus iness continuity and crises management p lans) as well as 
structural measures (e.g. retro fitting existing in frastructures).  Such an approach is imperative for the 
country g iven the need to face recurrent events whose impacts are too difficult to be mitigated from a 
physical perspective (for instance, wide spread flooding due to a hurricane) as well as the need to upgrade 
infrastructure that no longer meet the current design needs.

129. 
Climate change cou ld also have a severe impact on electricity generation in Belize. Hydropower 
provided 51% of electricity in 2013. Changes in precipitation and evaporation can affect river flows, 
reservoir inflows and ultimately, power production. Future climate change is likely to lead to greater 
uncertainties over the availability of water for many uses, including energy production, and will pose 
challenges to Belize’s capacity to manage water infrastructure effectively. Future reductions in inflows 
due to climate change could see hydropower production decrease by up to 10%, as early as the 2020s. In 
addition, significant elements of the fossil fuel supply, electricity generation and transmission 
infrastructure of Belize are on, or close to, the coast. These include power stations, substations, and 
sections of the transmission lines. Storage depots for fossil fuels at Belize City Port and Cala Grande in the 
south are vulnerable to coastal storm surges, inundation, sea level rise and coastal erosion. The Caribbean 
Sea has experienced rising sea levels, at a rate of 3.2 mm/year in the last 20 years. A World Bank study 

69 

 
 
concluded that Belize could see a 40% increase in the extent of its storm surge zone this century due to 
sea level rise and land movements. Imported energy from Mexico is also at risk from climate impacts 
occurring there which may not have affected Belize itself. 

Weaknesses in In frastructure 

130. 
Vu lnerab ility to climate change and natural hazards is compounded by weaknesses in 
in frastructure, most notably in the energy sector. Belize’s transmission lines are vulnerable to climate 
impacts as they run through varying geographies rang ing from the coastal plain to lowlands, and the Maya 
Mountains. Hurricanes pose a particular risk to the transmission and distribution system, as evidenced by 
Hurricane Dean in 2007: In the first six hours, the dispatched load decreased by more than half (from 
about 40 MWh to about 16 MWh) mainly due to failure of distribution lines. The system was beg inning to 
recover when the failure of a transmission line brought the system to an almost total blackout.  In some 
instances, there is a lack of knowledge on the exact mechanisms by which a weather event results in 
system outages. In addition, the non-segmented nature of the transmission and distribution network 
means failure in one part of the system can disrupt the national power supply altogether. 

131. Underdeveloped and d ilap idated in frastructure, particu larly in the transport sector, is also a 
key constraint to reduce vu lnerab ility to d isasters . Throughout Belize, critical infrastructure, such as 
public buildings and roads, are in need of rehabilitation or reconstruction. The road network is particularly 
vulnerable due to the lack of redundancy (see Figure 52). 35 Furthermore, roads have not adequately 
incorporated hazard and risk into detailed road designs and this, coupled with inadequate preventive 
maintenance and rehabilitation, results in unsafe road conditions during flooding events. During an 
extended period of rainfall in 2008 an estimated US$11 million in damages were incurred, of which US$5 
million were to road infrastructure 36 . With 70% of the population living near primary and secondary road 
networks, flooding of one section of roadway can cut access and severely disrupt the flow of economic 
and social movement. Of the 3,281 km of road network only 20% are paved and the quality of road 
infrastructure is poor and deteriorating at an increasing rate. According to IADB (2013), the proportion of 
road systems considered to be in poor or bad condition increased from 12% (2007-2008) to almost 60% 
(2012-2013). The Government has prioritized the transport sector in their medium-term investment 
planning , considering its vulnerability and socio-economic importance. 

132. Given Belize’s topography and the poor maintenance o f the drainage systems , flood ing of the 
road network from excess rain fall, storm surge or riverine overflows , resu lts in s ign ificant traffic delays 
and therefore economic impacts due to the d isruption o f the supply chains .  In the case of Hurricane 
Keith (2000), the roads around Belize remained under water for between 3 and 7 days resulting in US$16.1

million in indirect losses. 37  Similarly, after Tropical Depression 16 in 2008, communities near San Ignacio 
had limited access into and out of the municipality as one of the two bridges into the municipality was 
completely submerged for multiple days. 38   

133. 
Against th is backdrop the Government developed the National Climate Res ilient Investment 
Plan (NCRIP) to address the impacts o f climate change on social and economic development. This plan 
was elaborated with support from the World Bank and financial support from the Africa Caribbean Pacific 
(ACP) European Union (EU) Natural D isaster R isk Reduction Program, received through the Global Facility 
for D isaster Recovery and Reconstruction (GFDRR). Adopted on October 2013, this multi-sectoral plan lays 
out priority investments by sector, integrating physical interventions with capacity building activities and 
policy actions, to quantifiably reduce vulnerability and build climate resilience in the country. In the past, 
Belize’s leg islation and policy measures to mainstream disaster risk management (DRM) were fragmented 
and lacked ownership and participation of ministries. To address this disconnect, the NCR IP engaged all 
relevant stakeholders from the beg inning to devise holistic and participatory approaches to address 
climate resilience. Based on the NCR IP, the Government has articulated a medium-term plan that seeks 
to fully integrate climate change adaptation, climate variability, and comprehensive disaster management 
into national development planning processes and actions. 

134. 
Through the NCRIP, the Government made great strides to prioritize road in frastructure 
investments for enhanced climate res ilience. This has been based on two considerations: (a) socio-
economic criticality of the road network; and (b) flood susceptibility of the primary and secondary road 
networks. Criticality of the roads was assessed through a participatory multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) 
process with Government and key stakeholders such as NGO representatives and private sector, while the 
flood susceptibility was carried out using a data-driven analysis. The results from the MCE process 39 and 
the flood susceptibility evaluation were used to identify priority areas for investments. The NCR IP 
identified approximately US$430 million in physical investment needs, of which there is a US$125 million 
financing gap. The World Bank is providing support through a recently approved US$30 million loan for 
the Belize Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project (BCR IP). 

Offshore Oil Exp loration 

135. 
The poss ib ility o f tapp ing on o ffshore o il exp loration as an additional source o f revenues and 
growth has been criticized because o f the potential risks posed to its major sectors o f tourism and 
fisheries and h igh -pro file foreign d irect investments . The tourism sector is estimated to employ some 
28% of Belize’s workforce and was responsible for 21% of its GDP in 2014; fisheries is believed to employ

some 15% of the working population. At least one study estimates that the risk of an oil spill or damage 
to the environment and ecosystems could be bigger than the return that offshore oil exploration could 
bring in the medium in long runs (see Cisneros-Montemayor et al. (2013)). In addition, during 
consultations associated with this SCD , concerns were raised that offshore oil drilling could affect or 
discourage high profile investment projects such as Norweg ian’s cruise ship port in Harvest Caye, 
Leonardo D i Caprio’s proposed development on B lackadore Caye, the proposed Stake Bank cruise ship 
port and resort, and the luxurious 8-star Puerto Azul development in the Northern Two Cayes.   

136. 
The stakes are very h igh as tourism and fisheries emp loy a s ign ificant share o f the popu lation. 
A study by the World Resources Institute in 2008 estimated that the value of the reef and fisheries, 
tourism and shoreline protection contributed $700 million annually to Belize; higher estimates peg the 
value of the reef closer to one billion dollars annually.  Tourism alone brings in $680 million annually and 
by far the biggest and most popular attractions for visitors are the marine protected areas, according to 
the government’s own statistics, as compiled by the Belize Tourism Board.  Commercial fishing brings in 
only about US$14 – $16 million annually for about 4,500 licensed fishermen and their families, but sport 
fishing already provides 2,000 jobs, and the Bonefish Tarpon Trust estimates sport fishing contributes 
about $100 million annually to the Belizean economy.   In terms of employment, government reports 
estimated that 15,000 Belizeans benefited directly or indirectly from fishing activities. 

137. 
The debate on the pros and cons o f o il exp loration v is a v is its impacts on b iod ivers ity and 
tourism sector has been pro fuse in Belize.  These issues have been a part of national discussion as 
evidenced by consistently favorable rulings of high-profile court cases for both NGOs and IPs, local and 
international media attention on marine eco-system and eco-tourism issues, and the consultation and 
engagement process with NGOs initiated by the Government of Belize on its draft Petroleum Exploration 
Zones and Exploration Guidelines. A recent public referendum in 2012 resulted in a 98% vote against oil 
exploration and a subsequent annulment of oil concessions pending environmental impact assessments. 
This decision, however, has recently been relaxed. 

138. 
There have been cons istent mechan isms for consultations with civ il society sponsored by the 
Belizean government. Key mechanisms consisted of public consultations by the Coastal Zone 
Management Authority and Institute (CZMAI ) on the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan and the 
recent release by the Government of Belize of its draft petroleum guidelines for exploration and 
extraction. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan has been mandated under the Coastal Zone 
Management Act and determines the sustainability of coastal land use and outlines recommendations for 
sustainable development along the entire coastal zone in Belize.  The plan makes use of scientific 
geographic information system (GIS) data provided by the Natural Capital Project of Stanford University 
and WWF to develop scenario mapping for conservation, economic development, and trade-offs between 
the two.  The results have been used to inform coastal zone management for the entire Belizean Coast 
that designates areas for preservation, restoration, development, and other uses.   

72 

 
 
 
139. 
In early 2015, consu ltations with NGOs and IPs on the draft Petro leum Exp loration Zones and 
Exp loration Gu idelines reaffirmed concerns on the risks o f o ffshore o il exp loration.  The draft Petroleum 
Exploration Zones and Exploration Guidelines is based on the premise that Belize can be parceled out in 
petroleum concessions. I t divides Belize into four zones: zone 1, where no petroleum exploration is to be 
allowed, and zones 2 to 4, where petroleum exploration would be allowed with varying degrees of 
restrictions and guidelines, ranked based on priority level.  Only the Maya Mountain Massif (with 14 
protected areas) and north Ambergris Caye are listed in zone 1.  Zone 1 also includes most of offshore 
Belize, whereas the atolls and cayes offshore are listed as zone 2, the areas where exploration would be 
allowed with maximum restrictions.  Concerns have been raised that the B lue Hole, one of the greatest 
touristic attractions in the world, is included in the area shaded as zone 2.  Oceana Belize and the Belize 
Coalition to Protect Our National Heritage have called for a complete moratorium on any offshore oil 
exploration in Belize territorial waters.  The Sarstoon Temash Institute for Indigenous Management 
(SATI IM), representing indigenous peoples in Belize, has also openly rejected the draft. The most recent 
concession map shows that the company which had been g iven a contract covering the B lue Hole, Princess 
Petroleum, had relinquished that area, although it retains a concession over adjacent waters.   

140. Historically , petro leum exp loration began in 1938 when Shell was g iven a license to conduct 
exp loration work.  The first oil exploration well in Belize was drilled in 1956 by Gulf Oil in the Yalbac area 
in Cayo D istrict.  Between 1956 and 1982, 41 exploration wells were drilled by major oil companies such 
as Gulf, Philips, Anschutz , Chevron, Esso and Placid.   From 1982 to 1997, only nine further exploration 
wells were drilled by small or independent companies, i.e. , Spartan, Central Resources, Lucky Goldstar, 
Dover and Bright Hawk.  Exploration wells drilled in Belize before 1997 found some oil, but there were no 
commercial discoveries. 

141. 
The first commercial d iscovery came in June 2005 by Belize Natural Energy Ltd . From its first 
exploration well Mike Usher #1 in the Spanish Lookout Community. Belize Natural Energy Ltd. made a 
second discovery in the Never Delay area with the well Never Delay #1.  Both fields are located on the 
marg in of the Corozal Basin, which is a part of the larger Peten Basin extending into Guatemala and 
Mexico. The produced oil is trucked to a gathering facility at the B ig Creek Port for export to the US Gulf 
Coast. A percentage is sold on the local market to a few large scale producers in the agriculture industry. 
The success of BNE made Belize more attractive and allowed the Government to negotiate for more 
favorable fiscal terms in subsequent licenses. 

Factors that May Affect Social Sustainability 

142. 
The main challenge for social sustainab ility in Belize stems from a non -inclus ive growth model. 
In spite of reasonably robust economic growth rates, unemployment remains relatively high in Belize 
while poverty and human development outcomes seemed to have worsened according to the latest data 
available. The most remote and isolated areas in the country tend to have the lowest welfare indicators. 
Education outcomes are poor and returns to schooling almost nonexistent suggesting that urgent 
attention needs to be g iven to reform of the education system. Crime and violence are also high and are 

73 

 
believed to affect disproportionately the bottom 40% - although data collection in this area remains 
difficult and existing household surveys do not seem to capture that effect with precision.  

Remoteness  

143. Non -monetary poverty has increased in Belize suggesting that the poor and vu lnerable su ffer 
d ifferent forms o f deprivations . Widening the lens of household welfare beyond monetary indicators 
illustrates other multiple deprivations experienced by the poor, which limit their economic opportunities. 
For instance, as of 2009, 3% of the extreme poor had health insurance, much less than the coverage of 
the highest quintile (19%). Pre-school enrollment rates of children 3-4 years old from poor households are 
half of that of children from the two top quintiles of the consumption distribution. A gap of similar 
magnitude is also seen for enrollment in secondary education. Furthermore, a relatively larger fraction of 
children 13-16 years old from poor households that are attending school receive primary rather than 
secondary level education, signaling uneven gaps in school performance and attainment and in the quality 
of education. Unsurprising ly, compared to the rest of the populat ion, the housing conditions of the poor, 
including access to basic services such as electricity, are also worse (Table 8).

144. 
The most remote and poorest reg ions of the country tend to have the lowest welfare ind icators. 
The prevalence of low birth weight, a leading infant health indicator associated with development 
difficulties and welfare costs later in life, is high nationally, and more persistent in some of the poorest 
reg ions of the country. Data from UNICEF for the period 2006-2011 shows that 14% of the Belizean infants 
weight less than 2,500 grams, much higher than the low-birth weight rate for the LAC reg ion (8%). Data 
for 2011 broken down by reg ions also illustrate disparities across different parts of the country. For 
instance, Corozal, the reg ion with highest poverty rate (jointly with Toledo) has the highest prevalence of 
low-birth weight (Figure 53, Panel A). Likewise, splitting the sample by quintiles of a wealth index reveals 
that this problem is more persistent for the bottom 40% (Figure 53, Panel B). A similar pattern is observed 
across ethnic groups, with Mayans and Creoles being the more disadvantaged.

SATI IM, the Tol edo Al caldes Association, the Tol edo Ma ya Cultural Council, a nd the Ma ya Lea ders Al liance have 
ma na ged to use the cour t system to protect a nd asser t collective indigenous ownership over ancestral Mayan lands.  
Key cour t ca s es a nd rul i ngs i nc l ude the fol l owi ng: 
I n 1996 , the Ma yan communities l aunched their fi rst legal challenge a gainst the Bel izean government over

Commi s sion on Human Rights (ICHR) a rguing tha t by granting l ogging a nd oil concessions i n indigenous

under the Amer i ca n Dec laration of the Ri ghts a nd Duties of Ma n. I n Oc tober 2004, the I CHR ruled in favor 
of the peti ti oners, concluding tha t the failure of the government to consult with the Ma yan people, and 
the nega ti ve environmental effects ar ising from the concessions, constituted violati ons under international 
huma n r i ghts l aw. 
I n 2007 , the Supreme Cour t determi ned tha t the Ma ya n communities of Conej o a nd Sa nta Cruz hold

pa r ti es to uti lize the proper ty and res ources located on lands bel onging to the communities of Conejo and 
Sa nta Cruz amounts to a vi ol a ti on of the Cons ti tuti on.  
I n 2008, the Supreme Cour t extended the fi ndings with respec t to the communities of Conejo and Santa 
Cruz to a l l Maya vi llages in Tol edo a nd five a dditional Maya vi llages i n Sta nn Creek to the extent tha t the

I n 2010 , the Cour t of Appeal affirmed that a ll Mayan communities i n the Tol edo Distr ict hold customary

A h igh fraction o f Belizean ch ildren under the age o f five show stuned growth .  A leading 
indicator of long-term nutritional status, stunting is a primary manifestation of malnutrition among other 
diseases. In 2011, standardized height for age measures for Belize show that 22% of the children are    
stunted (less than two standard deviations of the WHO Child Growth Standards median), almost twice the 
fraction recorded in the LAC Reg ion (12%). The data also reveals a strong gradient between stunting and 
household wealth, area of residence (higher for rural households) and ethnicity (Figure 54), among other 
socioeconomic factors. This is another indicator of the regressiveness of Belize’s growth model that needs 
to be addressed so that the country can show progress in reducing extreme poverty and improving shared 
prosperity.

Lackluster Schoo l Ach ievements  

146. 
Average measures o f schoo l participation and skills acqu is ition ind icate major needs for 
improvement, with large inequalities across wealth qu intiles and ethn ic groups .  Data from the two 
latest UNICEF’s MICS surveys (2006 and 2011) has consistently estimated primary enrollment to be around 
95%, yet fewer than half of students complete primary on time and many drop out in the transition to 
secondary (Naslund-Hadley et al 2013). As of 2011, 55% of the children of secondary school age actually 
attended secondary or higher. Beyond participation, learning outcomes also appear to be weak.  In 2011, 
only 44 percent of students taking the national primary school examination received a score of satisfactory 
or above, and as discussed earlier, attainment of basic education does not appear to be valued by the 
labor market (Naslund-Hadley et al 2013).  Rather than covering the entire elig ible population, 
participation in primary school is still influenced by family incomes (Figure 55, Panel A). Such a relationship 
is even more marked for secondary education. For instance, one in four children from the bottom 20% of 
the wealth index distribution attend secondary school, compared with more than four out five children 
from the highest quintile (Figure 55, Panel B). Similarly, ethnicity appears to be a strong correlate of 
human capital accumulation (Figure 54, Panel C). These are additional challenges for boosting shared 
prosperity in Belize that may be related to location and geography.

These outcomes po int to challenges o f access , costs , and low quality in the education system.  
In Belize, over 80 percent of primary and secondary schools are privately operated, but most of these 
schools are publicly subsidized.  Relatively high rates of public spending on education, at around 7 percent 
of GDP, have not succeeded in providing universal access or high quality in this system for several reasons. 
In particular, financial allocation mechanisms favored better-off, urban schools until recently, and there 
is very little public quality assurance (Naslund-Hadley et al 2013).  In addition, direct costs of attending 
school are relatively higher than in reg ional neighbors, and the need to pay fees, buy uniforms and 
supplies, and pay for transport (particularly at the secondary level where many do not have access to a 
nearby school) were frequently cited in consultations as significant deterrents to staying in school.     
Opportunity costs may also be high, particularly for poor households that benefit from children’s 
contribution to the family’s livelihood.   A closer look at the issue of child labor is afforded via the 2011 
MICS survey, and specifically at the proportion of children age 5-14 years involved in at least one hour of 
economic and/or 28 hours of domestic work per week. According to this definition, 10% of children in that 
age range are involved in child labor. I t is also clear from the data that child labor is strong ly linked to 
family wealth, school attainment of mothers and ethnicity (Figure 56 and Figure 57).

148. 
Among working-age adu lts, educational ach ievement varies substantively by gender and ethnic 
status , with males largely less educated than females . The highest level of education of the majority of 
the employed (77 percent) was primary school or lower, while only 13 percent had finished secondary 
school and 7 percent had concluded tertiary education in September 2014. Men tend to be less educated 
than women in Belize. For example, the highest education level of 85 percent of men was primary school 
or below compared to 70 percent for women.  Also women were two times more likely than men to 
graduate from tertiary school – 10 vs. 5 percent respectively (Figure 58, Panel A). Additionally, ethnic 
minorities tend to be less educated. For example, the highest education level of 68 percent of employed 
Mayans is below primary (Figure 58, Panel B).

149. Wh ile Belize is on track to meet most o f the 2015 Millenn ium Development Goals (MDGs), the 
social challenges noted above limit progress towards poverty and hunger reduction, one o f the central 
MDGs . The most recent UNDP Progress Report for Belize (2013) states that the country is unlikely to meet 
the first MDG target: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. On the contrary, the same study reports that 
Belize will likely achieve most of the other MDGs, including net primary education enrolment ratios and 
literacy rate (MDG 2) 40 ; gender parity ratio in primary education (MDG 3); infant and child immunization 
rates (MGD 4); skilled birth attendance rate and antenatal care coverage (MDG 5); and slowing of the 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS, providing universal access to anti-retrovirals, significant success in reduced 
mother to child transmission rates and eliminating malaria (MDG 6).  

150. 
Social protection has been a priority in Belize and there are several recent programs that are 
encourag ing. Over the past couple of years, important advances have been made in the area of social 
protection in Belize. In February 2011, the Prime Minister launched Belize’s current flagship safety net 
Program, Building Opportunities for Our Social Transformation (BOOST), providing further evidence of the 

40 W i th rega rd to MDG 2 , note tha t Nä s lund-Hadley, Al onzo, Ma rtin (2013) bel ieve tha t MDG 2 wi ll not be met.

current Administration’s commitment to poverty alleviation. The Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) 
Program, which aims to smooth consumption for poor and vulnerable households while increasing 
investments in human capital investments, namely in education and health, has similar features to other 
CCT programs in the reg ion; however, it also includes a number of unique design elements including a 
differentiated benefit structure by grade and sex to address the opportunity costs of schooling (Table 10) 
as well as monthly payments through the local credit unions promoting financial inclusion (more than 98% 
of beneficiaries receive payments through the credit unions). In April 2013, the program benefitted some 
3,200 households (about 8,016 individuals) that had been targeted through the application of a proxy 
means test designed under the Sing le Information System of Beneficiaries.  

151. 
Better targeting and less fragmentation cou ld increase the effectiveness o f existing social safety 
net programs . Belize has a number of social assistance and safety net programs administered and 
managed by various ministries (Health, Education, Human Development, Agriculture) and non-
governmental organizations.  Subsequently, implementation is fragmented and with scarce budgets and 
the lack of a formal targeting mechanism for most programs, coverage of persons at risk is limited.  
Furthermore, when looking at resource allocation, spending , to some degree, continues to be more 
discretionary rather than programmatic.  As a result, there remains a large emphasis placed on school 
fees/books or scholarships, as well as pensions for public servants.  In 2010, about 1.1% of GDP was spent 
on programs benefitting children aged 6-17 years of age (mostly concentrated in school fees/books or 
school scholarships - and not targeted to the most vulnerable individuals) and about 1.6% of GDP was 
spent on the Public Officers Plan (pension), which only benefits those who have been public servants.

Crime and Vio lence 

152. 
Belize’s homicide rate is h igh in abso lute and relative terms . I t has increased 150 percent 
between 2000 and 2010, from 16 to 41 per 100,000 inhabitants and was the sixth highest in the world in 
2010 (Peirce and Veyrat-Pontet (2013)). Official data from Belize suggest that in 2012 the murder rate 
achieved 42.5 per 100,000 inhabitants— the highest rate on record in Belize which is also higher than the 
average rate for Central America and the Caribbean, ranking  Belize behind only Guatemala, Honduras, El 
Salvador, and Jamaica in terms of national rates. The situation gets worse in Belize City where the 
homicide rate is estimated at 106 per 100,000—a number similar to those observed in Guatemala City 
and San Salvador which are two of the most violent cities in the reg ion. According to data from the U.S. 

80 

 
 
 
Department of State, impunity is also a problem as evidenced by a very low conviction rate; between 1999 
and 2007, for example, only 10 percent of homicide cases resulted in a conviction (U.S. Department of 
State, 2012).  

153. 
Because Belize’s popu lation is small and interconnected , the social consequences o f crime and 
v io lence can be substantive. With a population of 2.7 million, Jamaica has a higher homicide rate—51 per 
100,000—than Belize (UNODC, 2011), but exposure to violence is believed to be significantly higher in 
Belize. According to recent research, 99 percent of Belizean youth have been exposed to violence, 
compared to 58 percent in Jamaica (Gayle and Mortis (2010)). This is significant because, in addition to 
negative psycholog ical effects on individuals, youth exposure to violence is considered an important risk 
factor for future perpetration of violence.

E. SYNTHES IS AND PRIORITIES 

154. 
Belize’s welfare ind icators have not improved as expected for a country that has experienced 
pos itive economic growth for the last 30 years. In fact, over the last 15 years or so, per capita income has 
almost stagnated. As part of the systematic diagnostic of the prospects for sustained growth and inclusion 
in the country, this section first discusses the factors that may help understand why, in spite of positive 
economic growth, Belize has not developed faster, and then outlines areas in need of a big push to 
accelerate progress towards the goals of boosting shared prosperity and reducing extreme poverty. 

Why Hasn’t Be lize Deve loped Faster? 

155. 
Belize is not d ifferent from many other small economies who have their development paths 
cond itioned on both exogenous and endogenous factors . For a small open economy rich in natural 
resources like Belize, a number of exogenous factors could condition its development path. Among those 
one could include size, geography, distance from large markets, and the degree to exposure to natural 
disasters – all of which are outside of the authorities’ control and could affect the country’s growth 
prospects. On the other hand, endogenous factors which could be seen within the purview of government 
policy, could also have a bearing on the country’s growth and shared prosperity prospects. Among these 
endogenous factors one could include the quality and relative abundance of factors of production, namely 
capital and labor, which in turn depend on government built policies and institutions. Development 
prospects would thus be a function of how the country manages these exogenous and endogenous 
factors. 

Exogenous Factors 

156. 
Belize’s g lobal comparative advantage is derived from its natural resource base, wh ich supports 
the tourism and agricu lture sectors , and its advantageous geographical proximity to major markets. 
Belize is famous for its beautiful beach islands on the second largest coral reef in the world, and its dense 
forests, and its cultural and historical heritage dating more than a thousand years. Tourists flock this small 
country to enjoy all this while the agricultural sector thrives with the exports of commercial crops such as 
sugar and citrus fruits. The country is also strateg ically located close to major markets in North, South and 
Central America and this offers the country an opportunity to mitigate risks associated with its small size 
and lack of economies of scale. As discussed in chapter 1, Belize growth performance has been 
characterized by a stop-and-go pattern suggesting that output volatility is an issue that needs to be 
addressed for this small middle income country.  There is not much that can be done to avoid volatility in 
the context of a small open economy, but diversification of trade partners, for example, could help 
mitigate its impact. Small economies also show high vulnerability to external shocks including in terms of 
trade and, depending on their geographic location and topography, natural hazards and climate change 
could also be sources of vulnerability. 41 The frequency and intensity of natural disasters usually 

41 The gl obal economic c risis of 2008-09 , for i nstance, had a ma jor impact on the country, a nd came on the heels of 
other exogenous s hocks i nc l udi ng food a nd fuel pr i ce i nc rea s es of 2008 a nd na tura l di s a s ters . 

82 

 
                                                             
contributes to erode fiscal space and increase debt-to-GDP levels with deleterious consequences for long -
term growth.  

157. With its small territory and popu lation, Belize su ffers with the consequences o f lack o f 
economies o f scale that can act as a barrier to economic growth . Belize’s growth performance is 
constrained by its limited availability of arable land. Despite having a relatively large territorial land mass 
of 22,810 Km2 , only a small fraction (700 Km2 ) is considerable arable. 42 The transmission channels through 
which size could affect growth are complex and difficult to deal with. Small economies are by definition 
also highly open economies which tend to specialize in a few sectors, not by choice but by necessity. They 
tend to import almost everything and have very few sources for obtaining foreign exchange. With 
openness and specialization comes terms of trade volatility, which has been found to lead to output 
volatility (Lederman and Maloney (2012)) which in turn can impact growth negatively if not managed 
properly (Ramey and Ramey (1995)). 43 Small economies also tend to have large public sectors, g iven the 
indivisibilities associated with the provision of public services and the limited diversification of economic 
activity and of the private sector.  

158. 
As in many other small states , the limited level o f sav ings in Belize is an important factor that 
has impacted its growth and development prospects . The literature shows that economic size is an 
important predictor for low savings, and the situation in Belize confirms this stylized fact. As discussed in 
chapter 1, gross domestic savings as a share of GDP in Belize has averaged around 10% in the recent past 
and this is well below the LAC average of 15% and one of the lowest levels amongst comparator countries. 
At the same time, the share of gross fixed capital formation over GDP is close to 20% which is a clear 
indicator of a domestic savings gap that predisposes the country to current account deficits and the 
buildup of debt. Foreign direct investment is an important source of financing in Belize and represents 
more than 49% of gross fixed capital formation (well above the LAC average of 18%), but again as in many 
other small states, FD I in Belize does not generate many productivity spillovers and/or backward and 
forward linkages in the local economy and therefore does not seem to have a significant impact on long-
term growth. 44 

159. 
Vu lnerab ility to natural d isasters and weather shocks can also impact sav ings , contribute to 
increase debt, and u ltimately affect growth negatively . According to at least one international ranking, 
Belize is the sixth most vulnerable country to natural disasters in the world (see Harmeling and Eckstein

(2013)) and faces average annual losses of the order of 3% of GDP stemming from weather events (see 
chapter 4). This type of vulnerability (along with volatility in terms of trade and output) can affect agents’ 
savings behavior negatively. According to the literature, if agents are averse to losses and are constantly 
having to reevaluate their spending decisions by virtue of frequent unpredictable shocks, they may display 
a behavior that favors present consumption with the implication that they will save less and place a lower 
weight on inter-temporal consumption optimization (see World Bank (2015)). In addition, whenever a 
disaster strikes, the government has to either reallocate expenditures to address the consequences of the 
disaster or borrow internationally. In 1961, a sing le event (Hurricane Hattie) caused losses equivalent to 
200% of GDP in Belize while early in the 2000s the debt-to-GDP ratio increased by more than 20 
percentage points as a result of another major disaster. As documented by Worrell (2015), governments 
of small open economies tend to cut capital expenditures first when faced with an adverse shock (such as 
a natural disaster), with negative consequences for long -term growth. 

Endogenous Factors 

160. 
The small s ize o f Belize’s popu lation is a limiting factor that affects its ab ility to grow faster, but 
the low quality o f the labor force is also an important constraint to growth . As discussed earlier, returns 
to education in Belize are low reflecting the low level of technical skills of the labor force. In addition, the 
country has traditionally had high unemployment rates reflecting a high reservation wage level for the 
local workforce which has led to the need to import labor through migration from neighboring countries. 
While there might be several factors at play that may help explain why the local workforce has such a high 
reservation wage, there are issues with the quality of education in the country that could be affecting the 
skills profile of the labor force and limiting the country’s competitiveness and growth potential. 

161. 
Belize has prioritized and invested more in education over the past few years , but the outcomes 
in terms o f education access , quality , and equity have not improved as one wou ld have expected. There 
is a clear evidence linking education to higher individual productivity and earnings (see, for example, 
Becker (1964); and Dogarawa (2011)). Furthermore, the literature establishes a causal link between 
investment in education and wages paid in the labor market (Mincer (1974)), as well as evidence that 
educated people are less vulnerable to preventable diseases, economic fluctuations, more responsive to 
social issues, and less prone to engage in criminal activities (Dowd and Aiello (2009); Carneiro et al. (2005); 
Groot and Brink (2010)). As discussed in Naslund-Hadley et al. (2013), in Belize formal education beg ins 
to pay off with the completion of secondary education. In addition, there is a high payoff associated with 
vocational education (relative to secondary) which is consistent with findings that the labor market in 
Belize needs skilled labor in the areas in which the country is doing well such as tourism (Arcia (2012)). 
However, the evidence shows that only 45 percent of secondary school-aged children attend school, 
substantially below the reg ional average of 80 percent. The proportion of trained teachers at the 
secondary level is also particularly low in Belize. In addition, access and equity outcomes are sub-par with 
preschool, secondary, and higher education having yet to reach the lowest income quintiles while 
attendance at the primary level has actually been on the decline.  

84 

 
162. 
The country ’s vu lnerability to climate change and natural hazards also has a bearing on the 
quality o f its in frastructure and stock o f cap ital. The long low-lying coastal areas are especially vulnerable 
to more intense and frequent tropical storms and hurricanes, flood damage, and rising sea levels. Like the 
rest of the Caribbean, Belize has experienced frequent natural disasters of catastrophic proportions, and 
recently suffered the impact of a Category 1 hurricane (R ichard in October 2010) and widespread flooding 
in 2008. Tropical Storm Arthur (May 2008) caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the agriculture 
sector. Hurricanes Keith (2000) and Iris (2001) each causing damage reaching 45 percent and 25 percent 
of GDP, respectively. In 1961, Hurricane Hattie destroyed Belize City and prompted the Government to 
build a new administrative capital 50 miles inland in Belmopan. Evidence presented in chapter 4 shows 
how vulnerable the energy transmission lines are to strong winds. A sing le major weather event can leave 
and has left significant parts of the country isolated due to power failures and flooded roads.  

163. 
Lack o f competition and stability issues in the financial sector are important factors that have 
been identified as constraints to growth in Belize. The lack of stability in the sector has effected financial 
intermediation, inhibiting economic growth in Belize.  A healthy financial sector can generate a number 
of positive spillovers to the rest of the economy: it mobilizes savings, promotes greater information 
sharing , improves and expands resource allocation and facilitates diversification of management of risks 
(IMF (2015)).  Sustainable financing of the economy and greater financial stability can be achieved by 
sound regulation, ensuring high capital requirements for systemically important banks, improving banks’ 
resolvability and fine-tuning the use of countercyclical measures.  As these measures are strengthened, 
access to finance can benefit from the better quality and cost of service that individuals and businesses 
can receive from the financial institutions.  The lack of stability within the sector has hampered market 
efficiency in Belize which is evident by: the temporary unwillingness to accept term deposits by some 
financial institutions, higher interest rate spreads, and the underdevelopment of short term financial 
instruments to a shortage of long term financing options.   Such evidence suggests the need for immediate 
financial sector reforms to tackle the current vulnerabilities effecting financial stability that could benefit 
and support a more robust foundation for wider, safer, and more efficient access to finance to support 
Belize’s economic growth. 

Prioritization Approach 

164. 
The approach adopted in th is SCD aimed at identify ing areas in need o f a b ig push to accelerate 
progress towards sustainab le growth and boosting shared prosperity. The exercise used to identify these 
areas was firmly anchored on a number of explicit criteria (Figure 59). First, the extent to which 
improvements in a g iven area would have substantial impacts on the twin goals. For example, the analysis 
in chapters 2, 3, and 4 explicitly considered how each of the topics discussed affected the most vulnerable. 
Second, for a small state facing problems of scale, it is important to take into account positive externalities 
and the trade-offs associated with any proposed intervention.  In that sense, this SCD has used the 
existence of complementarity effects and trade-offs as a criterion to identify the areas in need of greater 
attention. Third, g iven the observed stop-go pattern of growth in Belize and the country’s heightened 
volatility to exogenous shocks and exposure to natural hazards, sustainability has been an important 
criterion helping to define priority areas of focus. Finally, an additional factor included the existence of 

85 

 
self-reinforcing dynamics, which helped to introduce more granularity in the choice of areas and allowed 
the consideration of important nuances in the prioritization exercise. In practice, the approach followed 
three key considerations, as follows. 

Figure 59 : Pr ior it izat ion Cr ite r ia 

165. 
First, g iven that the analys is suggested the existence o f recurrent b ind ing constraints to growth, 
reforms that cou ld help break existing v icious circles were identified as areas o f attention . In that 
context, building on the existing strengths and comparative advantages of the country was also 
considered here. The basis for this emphasis stems from taking into account areas that complement 
progress in other areas. This led to the identification of three areas where policy levers could help address 
existing vicious circles: (a) improving education and skills; (b) addressing crime and violence; and (c) 
increasing resilience to climate change and natural disasters. 

166. 
Second , the need for institutional reform was cons idered a sine qua non cond ition for progress 
in other areas that cou ld un leash a v irtuous cycle o f sustainable growth and greater inclusion . A few 
areas that emerged during the stakeholder consultations that would be in need of institutional reform 

86 

 
 
included the taxation system (which is deemed inefficient and unfair), trade policy (which is believed to 
be biased against exports), the efficiency of public spending (which tends to be high and does not translate 
in the delivery public services of good quality), and the ethics and performance of public servants (where 
many thought there was marg in for improvement), among others. A broader focus on improving the role 
of the government in the economy could help spur improvements in competitiveness and increase the 
country’s capacity to save and invest more.  

167. 
Th ird , cons ideration was g iven also to structural issues that cut across and wou ld complement 
progress in d ifferent areas. In some cases, progress would be greatly enhanced if some structural changes 
could be enacted. By their very nature, those changes would have a broad impact on a number of areas. 
This led to the identification of the importance of improving the quality and availability of data to inform 
evidence-based policy making , promoting greater financial inclusion, and safeguarding the country’s fiscal 
sustainability g iven its potential impact on debt sustainability, output volatility, ability to provide quality 
public services, existence of fiscal space to maintain and restore physical infrastructure, for example 
(Figure 60). 

168. 
The identified priorities were also in formed by extens ive consu ltations with stakeho lders in the 
country. In terms of process, this SCD has drawn on existing background analysis and information that 
have helped identify key constraints to economic growth, inclusion, and sustainability, and has 
undertaken consultations with government officials, civil society, private sector and academia as well as 
in the donor community. The Government sees close synerg ies between the SCD and Belize’s National 
Development Plan (Horizon 2030). 

Improv ing Education and Skills  

169. 
Improv ing education and skills wou ld pos itively impact growth , inclus ion , and sustainability, 
and these pos itive impacts wou ld be rein forced by the adoption o f an appropriate migration po licy. 
Higher learning outcomes, greater equity and access to education would better equip the youth for the 
acquisition of skills demanded by the domestic labor markets and position them well to compete for 
better-paying jobs if they decide to emigrate. A more educated and skilled workforce would attract a more 
rewarding return to schooling and could help reduce the high reservation wage levels exhibited by 
Belizeans thus contributing to reduce the natural rate of unemployment and lowering the costs associated 
with the provision of social protection. In addition, an appropriate migration policy would ensure that the 
incoming migrants could fill the positions that many Belizeans, particularly young Belizeans, are unwilling 
to fill. What is certain is that a better educated labor force would have a significant impact on poverty 
reduction, especially if education outcomes are significantly improved at the secondary level, besides 
helping to develop greater backward and forward linkages in the economy, as discussed in chapter 4. 
Education is also a key building block for other priorities, in particular reducing crime and violence, and 
helping keep educated Belizeans in the country. 

170. 
The entry po ints to improve education and skills have been amp ly stud ied and d iscussed. They 
include greater attention to pre-school education, ensuring primary and secondary education access for 

87 

 
all children, improving teacher training , establishing quality assurance and accountability mechanisms to 
increase learning and improve efficiency, and expanding and tailoring existing vocational and training 
institutions to respond to the needs of the market, including training of migrants.  

Figure 60 : Pr ior it ies for Sustainable Growth and Inclusion 

Address ing Crime and Vio lence 

171. 
Recent research has underscored the importance o f core po licies and innovative approaches to 
deal with youth v io lence in LAC. Core policies are those that focus on the first five years of life of the 
child, keeping children in school, identifying at-risk youth who need remedial support, tailoring 
reproductive health services to the specific needs of young people, using the media to educate young 
people, and promoting effective parenting . Innovative approaches focus on developing education 
equivalency programs, job training , and financial incentives for youth (Cunningham et al. (2008)). In 
addition, the literature on crime and social interactions suggest investing in safe neighborhood programs 
with a strong police presence, fostering good police-community relations, reducing the availability and 
use of firearms and providing rehabilitation and second chance opportunities for young offenders 
(Carneiro et al. (2005)).  

88 

 
 
172. 
It is also important to comp lement such efforts with measures to strengthen v io lence 
prevention and law en forcemen t. Crime and violence are on the rise in Belize and represent a growing 
concern for the society g iven their associated high social and economic costs. The homicide rates in the 
country are amongst the highest in the world; at 41 per 100,000 it is more than five times the world 
average. Impunity is also very high with only 10% of homicide cases resulting in a conviction.  Significantly 
lower levels of crime and violence would impact economic growth positively and improve inclusion and 
sustainability in addition to having positive impacts on the twin goals as the bottom 40 percent are the 
most vulnerable to exposed to crime and violence.  

173. 
Address ing crime and v io lence wou ld complement progress in other priority areas with positive 
sp illovers on competitiveness and u ltimately growth . The links with education and skills is obvious as a 
self-reinforcing effect could lead to better inclusion. In the short to medium-term, there are entry points 
around creating income and learning opportunities to steer the youth away from joining criminal 
organizations, creating a safer environment for learning , and ultimately contributing to raise the skills 
profile of the labor force with expected positive spillovers on competitiveness and growth. Finally, it is 
essential to preserve the youth and avoid their exposure to crime, which in Belize is extremely high (at 
99% percent) and is believed to be an important risk factor for the perpetration of violence. 

Strengthen ing Res ilience to Climate Change and Natural Disasters 

174. 
Belize has made great strides to increase env ironmental res ilience but th is remains an 
important priority wh ich will requ ire attention to the country ’s in frastructure. Belize is one of the 
countries in the world which is most affected by weather-related events and other natural hazards. 
Combined, Belize incurs annual losses of close to 3% of GDP due to natural disasters. These losses add to 
fiscal pressures and constrain wealth accumulation. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency 
and intensity of weather-related events. In this context, it is essential to continue to make progress in 
moving from a reactive to a preventive approach to disaster risk management since this will help reduce 
social and economic costs of disasters. This will require constant attention to repair and strengthen 
existing road and energy infrastructure which remain extremely vulnerable to extreme weather events 
and can impose severe losses to livelihoods and economic activity. 

175. Disaster risk management investments (DRM) in Belize are critical to support the twin goals to 
end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in poorer segments o f society. Poor communities 
are disproportionately vulnerable to economic shocks and reduced mobility – particularly the minority 
groups in the southern and northern parts of the country. The vulnerability in the road networks, due to 
the lack of redundancy results in agricultural communities unable to access the larger markets in Belize 
City and Belmopan, students unable to attend schools, and goods not able to make it into rural 
communities.  Investing in disaster risk management will help to protect the limited assets of poor 
communities from natural disasters and climate change related events and to improve the access and the 
economic livelihoods of poor and vulnerable communities. 

89 

 
176. 
In add ition , DRM investments along the transportation network wou ld limit the loss o f 
economic output, improve productiv ity and reduce travel time by improv ing road cond itions and 
reducing traffic interruptions caused by extreme rain events . When the likelihood of damage to 
transportation networks is reduced, economic activity can more quickly return to normal levels. Examples 
from World Bank projects indicate that DRM investments would have the sizable economic benefits. For 
example in the Belize Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project: the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) 
of a sub-project, for a 1 in 50 year rainfall event, ranges from 23% to 26% with different climate scenarios. 
Using a discount rate of 12%, the Net Present Value (NPV) ranges from US$25.7 to US$35.1 million for an 
initial investment of US$13.0 million. 

Cross-Cutting Areas  

Availab ility and Quality o f Data 

177. 
The quality and availab ility o f data can in fluence a country ’s competitiveness and the efficiency 
o f its government, and th is is particu larly important in Belize where there is a dearth o f good quality 
in formation . In a recent survey conducted by the World Bank, 45 Belize is identified alongside other 28 
other countries as having a pronounced inadequacy or deprivation of poverty data. In order to become 
more efficient and obtain better results governments need good data. This is true from different ang les 
and perspectives. Budget decisions and policy choices have long -term effects on a country’s fiscal future 
and on the outcomes that the budget delivers for the country’s citizens. These decisions and policy choices 
can lead to much better results if they are based on rigorous and reliable evidence that can enable the 
government to select, fund, and operate public programs more strateg ically. In the case of Belize, there 
are serious limitations in the quality and availability of social and economic information that prevents the 
governments and prospective investors to make more informed decisions. These limitations can affect 
the effectiveness of government policy and inhibit new businesses. 

Increas ing Financial Inclus ion 

178. 
The availab ility o f financial serv ices remains narrow; particu larly to serve small and med ium 
enterprises . Notably missing financing instruments in the local financial markets are: micro-financing , 
micro-insurance, leasing and factoring .  The development of such instruments could support greater 
access to finance by small and medium enterprises and contribute to decreasing the identified credit gap 
of US$1,141 million for this important market segment. Greater financial inclusion can also help raise 
savings and investments which would have a positive impact on growth and shared prosperity. 

179. 
The creation o f the National Bank o f Belize (NBB) as an option against the lack o f competition 
in the banking sector may not be the best so lution . Operations began in September 2013 and the orig inal 
mandate of the NBB was to offer mortgages for public servants to become first t ime home owners.  
Capitalization of the Bank started with BZ$20 mi from the PetroCaribe fund.  As of June 2015, NBB had

approximately 1,100 clients with an extremely high demand.  The bank offers below market rates for 
lending at approximately 8.73% (domestic banks lending rate ranged from 9.54% to 11.4% in March 2015).   
NPLs have already increased to nearly 9% during the first two years of operations and this suggests that 
the NBB needs to strengthen immediately its reserve management before losses start to increase. As of 
June 2015, they had future intentions to widen the offering of their financial services, akin to a commercial 
bank, by accepting retail deposits, wire transfers, bill payments, offering credit cards and other services. 
The Government of Belize should be mindful of the risks associated that development state banks pose 
to financial sector development. International experience has shown negative outcomes (i.e. economic, 
financial and social value) when state banks actively compete in the same space as commercial banks (see 
Martinez and Vicente (2012)) including crowding out of existing banks especially when lending at below-
market rates. A better solution may be to promote greater stability in existing banks and foster the 
development of other instruments and products besides developing financial infrastructure. 

Safeguard ing Fiscal Sustainab ility 

180. 
Sustainab le progress towards the ach ievements o f the twin goals o f reducing poverty and 
boosting shared prosperity in Belize will also requ ire prioritiz ing fiscal sustainab ility . As argued in 
chapter 4, public debt levels can increase substantially depending on the outcome of court decisions on 
the compensation payments for the nationalized utilities. While the government has made sensible 
provisions to face the costs of the arbitration, the final outcome could require additional funding which is 
hard to predict with precision at this point. In that context, Belize would do well in safeguarding fiscal 
sustainability by continuing to seek ways to strengthen its fiscal position and reduce its debt level as a 
share of GDP. As a small and largely open economy, Belize is exposed to large terms-of-trade shocks that 
can introduce output fluctuation and affect growth negatively. A sure way to mitigate against external 
shocks is by building fiscal buffers that could help the authorities to keep a counter-cyclical fiscal stance. 
While the short-to-medium term outlook for Belize remain broadly favorable, projects financed with 
PetroCaribe resources may become future fiscal liabilities. Continued efforts to promote fiscal 
consolidation would help create fiscal space to finance priority expenditures (on education and resilience, 
for example) and boost the income of the bottom 40% of the population. 

Conclusion 

181. 
Belize has all the means and the potential to boost shared prosperity in a sustainab le way. To 
do so it can build on its strengths and comparative advantages, including making the most of its 
geographic location and cultural proximity to large nearby markets. While Belize has a relatively more 
diversified export basket than its average comparator country amongst the Caribbean and other small 
states, diversifying trade partners is a sure way to shield the economy from exogenous shocks and output 
volatility. Investment in the quality of education would help in different fronts, including reducing crime 
and violence, and creating the conditions to foster innovation with direct positive spillovers in Belize’s 
competitiveness and capacity to generate better paying jobs outside of the public sector. Improving 
management of the country’s natural resources and strengthening resilience with better infrastructure 
would help reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and contribute to sustainable development. The way 

91 

 
forward will not be without obstacles, but lack of political resolve to make progress in addressing the most 
binding constraints to growth and inclusion will only make matters worse. The priorities identified in this 
systematic country diagnostic present a pathway towards sustainable growth, greater inclusion, and 
enhanced shared prosperity.

Annex 1: HRV Growth Diagnostics Framework and its app lication to Belize 1 

Hausmann, Klinger and Wagner (2008) provide useful insights on practical elements for conducting a 
Growth D iagnostic.  I f a constraint is binding , then one or several of the following phenomena can be 
observed, depending on the type of evidence available: 

1. 

The (shadow) price of the constraint is high; 

2. 
Movements in the constraint should produce significant movements in the objective 
function; 

3. 
Agents in the economy should be attempting to overcome or bypass the constraint, and 
these economic actions can be observed; 

Agents less intensive in a binding constraint are more likely to survive and thrive and vice 

4. 
versa. 

A Growth D iagnostic was carried out in Belize in 2007 (See Hausmann and Klinger (2007)).  According to 
the authors access to finance was identified as the binding constraint to economic growth.  In particular, 
they highlight low savings, low access to international finance, and an extremely high domestic cost of 
finance. These were linked to government led investment during expansion periods that induced public 
deficits, crowding out and increased the cost of finance.  The following candidate constraints were 
rejected:   

• 

• 

Not Human Capital: Belize exhibits Low Returns to Education. 

Not Lack of Infrastructure: Belize shows little to no infrastructure congestion. 

• 
No macro instability: The imbalances that led to past growth busts were corrected.  But 
fiscal discipline (that affects savings) has been an issue. 

• 
No government micro-failures: The business environment seeming ly accurate for 
entrepreneurship. 

• 

Self-discovery process not optimal, but affected by access / cost of finance. 

An important caveat regarding the HRV Growth D iagnostic framework applied to Belize refers to the 
dynamic nature of the constraints.   As some constraints are removed others become binding .  
Furthermore, any outstanding or emerg ing issue can turn into a binding constraint as a result of policy 
inaction, policy errors, or some external element.  The implication of this observation is the need for

Annex 2: IFC’s Industry Note on Belize’s Oil Industry 

Crude oil exports amounted to $70.1 million in 2013, (11.5% of total exports), representing the largest 
share of exports and 4.3% of GDP. Since the major revamp of oil extraction in 2005, more than 90% of 
crude oil extracted was exported to international markets.  However, since 2013 oil exports have been 
decreasing steadily due to falling prices, depletion of reserves and lack of new discoveries. In the last year 
oil exports fell by 23.4%, to $11.8 million. According to EIU, oil output is expected to further decline in 
2015-2016.

While the oil sector remains a major prospect for Belize to diversify sources of growth and revenues, 
future exploration developments are facing opposition on environmental grounds, in addition to the 
mentioned challenges with depleting reserves and a lack of new discoveries. Future exploration of off-
shore oil production could create major growth opportunities, but also lead to challenges as it would likely 
impact biodiversity, the coral reef and eco-tourism.  

Belize’s history of oil exploration can be separated in two major periods, 1930s-2000 and post 2000. 
During the first period, 50 exploration wells were drilled, 34 onshore and 16 offshore. Companies granted 
exploration licenses included large oil companies like Shell, Texaco, Chevron as well as smaller companies 
like Occidental Petroleum and Philips Petroleum. None of the explored wells proved to be commercially 
viable. 

99 

 
 
 
 
 
 
In 2005, Belize Natural Energy Ltd. (BNE) made the first commercial discovery of petroleum in an area 
called Spanish Lookout in the Cayo D istrict. This discovery was developed by BNE into Spanish Lookout 
Oilfield, producing an average of 1,700 barrels of oil per day. Another discovery was made in the Never 
Delay area, with crude oil of similar properties 2 , producing 500 barrels of oil per day at its peak. Currently, 
there are 9 companies with exploration licenses that are carrying out drilling explorations with BNE being 
the only crude oil producer in the country.  

Fiscal Reg ime 

Currently, Belize has a hybrid fiscal reg ime, based on a combination of royalty/tax reg ime and production 
sharing reg ime. I t incorporates both production revenues sharing with the government in addition to 
working interest in oilfields and a windfall profits tax.  

Producing companies pay 5 different forms of revenues to the government: 

1. Royalty 
2. 40% income tax 
3. Government Production Share 
4. Revenues from the Government’s 10% working interest in oilfields 
5. Petroleum Surcharge from windfall profits from high oil prices 

In addition to these payments, producing companies pay additional annual licensing and rental fees, in 
addition to a transportation tax 3 .

Annex 3: IFC’s Industry Note on Belize’s Agricu lture and Agribus iness 

Agriculture accounts for 13% of Belize’s GDP, 10.2% of its employment 4 and more than 2/3 of its exports. 5 
38% of Belize land areas is suitable for agriculture and 7% of that is currently utilized for farming.6 
Traditionally Belize has grown commercial crops such as sugar and citus fruits for export to Europe and 
the USA whereas food crops have been cultivated at a subsistence/ small scale for local consumption.  
Mennonites (see Box 1) are the first players in large scale commercial food based agriculture and are at 
the forefront in food exports from Belize.  

Box 1 : Mennonite community in Be lize 

I n 1959 , s ome 3 ,000 Mennonites moved to Bel i ze, hopi ng to s ta r t a fa rmi ng community. They s i gned a s pecial 
a greement wi th the government that exempt them from military service and cer tain forms of ta xation while giving 
them compl ete freedom to fa rm wi thi n thei r communi ti es .  
Si nce then the Mennonite community has grown in s ize and presence, expanding to a reas of Corozal, Orange Walk 
a nd Ca yo, i n a ddition to or i ginal s ettlement by the Ri ver Hondo. Cur rently, the overall Mennonite community has

o Sugar -  $53.7 million 
o Citrus concentrate - $53.3 million 
o Bananas – $44.24 million 7

As per the Govt. of Belize’s National Food and Agricultural policy 2002-20, the focus will be on:  

accelerating the diversification of both local/export-oriented agriculture, promoting agro-
processing and value adding as a means of expanding opportunities and increasing the income of 
the rural sector, actively promoting market/trade expansion both locally and internationally, 
increasing the efficiency, profitability and competitiveness of the sector, and improving and 
conserving the natural/productive resource base to ensure long-term sustainable productivity/ 
viability. 

Belize also has potential in agri-business whereby its citrus fruit and livestock production can be converted 
to value added products for exports and use in its tourism sector. This has started with sauces and spices 
but can extend to jams, jellies, fruit juices and livestock products and go further up the value chain. This 
will require attracting international buyers, processors and growers to Belize.  

• 

The future growth of agriculture and agri processing in Belize will depend on the following : 
• Trade policies in Europe where Belize sells most of its sugar due to preferential access 
Increase in commercial food farming on the lines of Mennonites. This will require 
Inputs such a capital for land development , irrigation facilities 
o Availability of large land parcels without imping ing on protected biodiversity areas 
o Opening of new export markets 
• Transport, storage and log istic infrastructure for cash crops and processed products 
The challenges for IFC to invest in this sector in Belize are the following : 

o 

- 

- 

- Competitiveness: At present Belize depends on preferential access unitl 2016 , e.g . sugar 
Lack of scale: Very few large scale players except the Mennonites 
- Underutilization: Many fruit farms are not fully utilized, e.g . citrus, banana 
Limited FD I except ASR and Green Tropics in sugar sector. Concern over nationalizations , e.g . in 
power sector and telecom sector, by overseas investors  
Environmental concers: some projects negatively impact the environment, e.g . sugar (land 
clearing) and aquaculture (disease) 
Positive development 

- 

- 

- Caribbean countries are exploring supplies from Belize, e.g . Trinidad & Tobago 
- Reg ional agri business companies are coming to Belize to access the Central America market, e.g. 
Grace Kennedy of Jamaica 
Two large FD Is in sugar sector in 2012, ASR of USA and Green Tropics from Guatemala/ Spain 
- D iversification in non traditional crops such as papaya, hot peppers and cocoa 
Import substitution efforts, e.g . soybean production 
Sector challenges 

- 

- Preferential access will lapse after 2016 
- Natural disasters affect investment and output 
- Data unavailaibility

Annex 4 : IFC’s Indust ry Note on Be lize ’s Tour ism Sector 

Tourism is the most important industry in Belize, representing 21% of GDP and 28% of employment. In 
2013, Belize received 294,000 tourists, a 6% increase from 2009. Recent growth has been driven by North 
America, with 70% of tourists arriving from the US and Canada. Average tourist expenditure per day has 
increased by 11% since 2009, totaling $160 per day.  Although the majority of tourists arrive by water, the 
amount of tourists arriving by land has increased by 18% in the same period.  

Belize developed a National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan (“The Master Plan”) in late 2011 that sets 
the tourism strategy and objectives through 2030. The Master Plan envisions a 3.8% CAGR increase in the 
tourism sector by 2030, with a focus on the overnight sector, which currently generates 80% of tourism 
revenue. The Master Plan has identified 6 tourism products upon which to structure the country’s tourism 
offering : i) Cultural, ii) Nature-Based, iii) Sun & Beach, iv) Cruise, v) Nautical, and vi) Leisure & 
Entertainment.   Implementation is expected to be driven by both the government and the private sector, 
with the government providing the necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework and the private 
sector bring ing in investments.  

According to the government, the overnight sector alone is currently growing at a 9% rate. When taking 
all sectors into account, the government expects that the tourism industry could grow by 43% CAGR by 
2030.  

On the private sector side, investments are currently happening in the development of cruise tourism and 
accommodations. For the cruise segment, 2 new ports are being envisioned: one is a private port facility 
in the south for a major cruise line and the other a docking facility in Belize district where cruise ships 
come into port. Belize currently has a tendering port and would need a docking facility to ensure greater 
disembarkation. A bill has already been passed to enable the docking facility and another one is expected 
to facilitate the private port facility.   

On the accommodations front, the number of tourism establishments in Belize have increased by 4% since 
2009 to 757. The government estimates that there are 600 hotels currently, with an average size of 10-12 
rooms. Most consist of boutique properties, offering an intimate environment but fall on the high end in 
terms of cost. 60% of accommodations are owned by local investment 40% are owned by expatriates. This 
model has allowed Belize’s tourism sector to grow at a more sustainable rate compared to Mexico and 
Guatemala, who chose properties with higher room capacity. The boutique model has allowed Belize to 
build on the SME value chain and grow gradually, reflecting the country’s past priorities.  

There has been little infiltration from major hotel chains, with the Radisson in Belize City being the only 
exception. According to the government, the lack of infiltration by major hotel chains is due to the 
saturation of physical planning assets. New destinations require proper planning from which to provide a 
hotel profile. Where there is space to move and grow, it will be possible to look at larger, higher end 
properties.  

The Tourism Master Plan envisions a balancing of the smaller-scale, boutique model with flagship 
properties. Belize had not been able to attract flagship properties due to its risk profile, recent 
nationalizations, and non-conducive leg islative framework. The leg islative framework would require 
increased clarity in terms of how FD I is processed and evaluated to create a level playing field for both for 
FD I and local investment. The Master Plan recognizes that larger scale anchor accommodations are 
needed to target a certain desired market. The finalization of the Master Plan has been welcome from 
investors.  

104 

 
Beltraide, Belize’s investment promotion agency, has facilitated investments in hotels worth US $5 million 
in the past 5 years, mostly in boutique resorts with supporting amenities. There has been a lot of action 
in high-end investments and eco-lodges.  Beltraide has seen most interest come from Americans, but also 
had an I talian Group proposing a major investment of $500 million, which is currently going through the 
necessary environmental licensing procedures.  A few strateg ic investors are also looking at luxury hotels. 
According to Beltraide, the investment pipeline is robust and full.  

Private investment has also taken place on the keys:  a private island was recently purchased by the 
Government of Mexico, which is now also going through the environmental licensing process. A luxury 
hotel line is also looking at another island off of Belize City and is going through the pre-feasibility process. 
I t will then need to go through the environmental assessment process.  

Market Expans ion Issues : 

70% of tourism arrivals in Belize have come from the US and Canada and this continues to be case. All 
major US airlines travel to Belize, which is part of its appeal and competitive advantage. Proximity is a key 
competitive factor for the country. There has been a concerted effort to diversify by looking at South and 
Central America for accessibility. The border crossing through Central America has become a new 
potential for generating more tourism arrivals. Land arrivals have been the fastest growing means of 
arrival in the past 5 years.  

According to Beltraide, Guatemala has usually taken the bulk of Central American tourism. Belize wants 
to engage in this market. The agency feels that multi-reg ional destinations are the way forward to tap into 
the Central American reg ion. There are issues of connectivity, accessibility of road infrastructure and the 
Spanish language.  Tapping into this market would require substantial investment. Belize has not tapped 
into the South American market yet. They are beg inning to look at this potential by examining visa 
requirements.  

Belize has also done little to tap into the European market. The country does not have European carriers 
with direct service or same day connections, creating challenges.  I t has also done little to incentivize 
travel.  

Costa R ica is Belize’s primary competitor, followed by Guatemala. Panama also competes with Belize in 
terms of its progressive product lines.  Beltraide is having conversations about the opening up of Cuba, 
trying to assess how it will affect Belize as destination.  

Emp loyment in the Tourism Sector: 

Employment in the tourism sector has increased by 13% since 2010, employing 18,900 people, according 
to the World Tourism Organization. The Ministry of Tourism puts this figure higher, estimating that the 
sector employs 1 in 6 jobs in the country. Belize has seen growth in accommodations and tour and travel 
services within the country, with incremental increases in both sectors. Given past trends, there are 
opportunities for further employment growth. One limiting factor is that the true economic impact of 
tourism is not known because data collection is a challenge. According to the Ministry of Tourism, Belize’s 
tourism numbers are conservative as they rely on the World Tourism Council, which rates Belize as route 
#8 in terms of employment growth.  

105 

 
 
The Ministry has mentioned that capacity in the tourism sector is an issue. A well-qualified work force is 
critical, but this capacity does not fall under work program of Ministry of Tourism. The Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) has traditionally supported tourism development in Belize and is currently 
involved in the Economic Development Council to look at the institutional arrangement to roll out the 
Master Plan.  

Med ical Tourism: 

Belize has begun exploring the option of medical tourism due to its proximity to the US market and the 
affordability of the healthcare product it provides. Belize hired a consultant from Costa R ica to evaluate 
what it has to offer in this niche and where it can improve. I ts strategy is to learn from those that are doing 
it well is first (i.e Costa R ica), and then differentiate.  

Challenges to developing this sector are leg islation, liability insurance and accredited medical facilities. 
Incentive programs for participation of local practitioners are all in proposal stages with the Ministry of 
health. Beltraide is currently trying to finalize an executive paper in order to proceed with a broader action 
plan with Ministry of Health.  I t is currently facing some constraints in its readiness to promote and 
develop this sector, but it sees potential.
