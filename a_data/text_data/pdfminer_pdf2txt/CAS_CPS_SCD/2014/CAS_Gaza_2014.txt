I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The World Bank Group’s involvement in the Palestinian territories dates back to 1992 when 
it provided the blueprint for donors’ subsequent involvement in the West Bank and in Gaza.  The IFC 
began investing in the West Bank & Gaza (WB & G) after the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, while MIGA 
initiated activities in 1997 with its West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund (IGTF).   

2. 
This proposal for the World Bank Group’s forthcoming engagement during the period FY 
2015-16 has been developed jointly by IFC, MIGA and the World Bank. The last Interim Strategy 
(for the period FY 2012-14) was also a joint product of the Bank and IFC. During its implementation 
period, MIGA’s program grew considerably—both in the West Bank and in Gaza. IFC’s and MIGA’s 
participation in the current strategy has enhanced its emphasis on private sector development. 

3. 
Prolonged conflict and deep-seated uncertainty has required the World Bank to rely on 
occasional interim strategy notes rather than medium-term partnership strategies and frameworks. 
However, Executive Directors have reviewed the program regularly: twice in the intervening two years, in 
May 2013 and May 2014, the Board discussed the program’s implementation in response to political and 
economic developments. The previous strategy was accompanied by a results monitoring framework, 
which the country team used to assess progress and to draw lessons of implementation experience that are 
summarized in this document. 

4. 
In the highly unpredictable operating environment, institution strengthening to build the 
foundation of a strong Palestinian administration has been central to the Bank’s program, while 
IFC has focused on the development of the financial and infrastructure sectors.  The Bank has been 
assisting the Palestinian territories since 1994, with assistance financed from IBRD’s net income, with 
each transfer requiring the approval of the Board of Governors. Leveraging donors’ funds, selective 
engagement and systematic follow-up on implementation have allowed continuity in the program: six 
development policy grants have supported the Palestinian agenda of public financial management and 
fiscal strengthening, while investment projects have helped develop the education, municipal, water and 
social protection sectors. Since 2008, IFC has invested US$269 million to support private firms in the 
financial and infrastructure sectors. 

5. 
The Bank Group’s response to the situation in Gaza is part of this Assistance Strategy. 
Hostilities began in early July 2014 and continued until the end of August. A cease-fire, announced in the 
end of August 2014, has provided the space to provide humanitarian assistance, initiate early recovery 
and plan international assistance for reconstruction. As the humanitarian numbers show, the latest conflict 
is more serious in terms of lives lost, physical destruction and productive losses than any previous conflict 
in Gaza. The World Bank Group (WBG) is supporting the recovery effort led by the Palestinian Authority 
(PA) and WBG response is closely coordinated with other donors. An aid conference, convened by the 
PA, Egypt and Norway is scheduled on October 12, 2014. A MIGA-supported project in Gaza has been 
damaged in the hostilities. Given its current foothold in the financial and infrastructure sectors in the West 
Bank, IFC will focus its Gaza reconstruction efforts in both of these sectors.  

6. 
The Assistance Strategy will balance short-term stabilization and reconstruction activities 
with operations that serve as platforms for maintaining continuous dialogue with the PA and 
donors. This deliberate “twin-track” strategy permits a continued emphasis on longer-term development 
priorities (state building, service delivery and support for private sector-led growth) while also retaining 
the high degree of flexibility needed to respond rapidly to emergency and other immediate needs.  In view 
of the limited financial envelope available, the World Bank will also continue to play a catalytic role 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
among development partners using World Bank-supported operations as opportunities to leverage and 
coordinate additional donor co-financing. 

7. 
The strategy outlined below is aligned with the Palestinian National Development Plan 
(2014-16) and the experience with the Bank group’s previous (FY 2012-14) interim strategy. The 
first pillar remains centered on strengthening public institutions for state building and improving service 
delivery. The second pillar continues to be focused on private sector development—with an added 
emphasis on increasing employment opportunities (through supporting reforms that encourage job 
creation in the private sector.) The same elements that constrain economic growth in the Palestinian 
territories overall affect Gaza even more, with Gaza reconstruction initiatives falling within both pillars. 
The development of this strategy has been informed by upstream discussions with various parts of the 
Palestinian Authority, private sector representatives, civil society and with donor partners. Gender-
informed interventions, introduced in the program during the implementation of the previous strategy, 
will be scaled up based on a gender action plan developed in FY 14.   

II. 

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT 

A. 

Political Developments 

8. 
The Palestinian Authority was established in the West Bank and Gaza shortly after the Oslo 
Accords of 1993. The PA assumed civilian responsibility for most of the Palestinian residents : its 
security powers were limited, however, to the major urban centers. Israel maintained full control of large 
tracts of land around settlements and primary movement axes, leaving 61 percent of the West Bank (so-
called Area C) outside the PA’s reach. Under the Oslo accords, this arrangement was intended as a 
temporary measure, to be replaced by a final-status agreement by the year 2000, but it still remains in 
force. Several peace processes were initiated but none so far have been successful. 

9. 
In November 2012, the UN voted in favor of the Palestinian Authority’s application for 
becoming a non-member observer state. While opening the door to the PA to apply for membership in 
a number of UN agencies, the positive vote put an additional strain on its relationship with Israel. US 
facilitated Palestinian-Israeli peace talks re-started in mid-2013. By the end of March 2014, the peace 
talks began to stall. After Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas forged a unity pact with Hamas (which 
formed the de facto authority in Gaza), Israel suspended its participation in the talks. Political 
developments in the region such as in Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria have added to the 
complexity of the topics being negotiated.  

10. 
A “consensus” Palestinian government was established in May 2014, with a cabinet of 
technocrats, who are not affiliated to any political party, endorsed by both Fatah (the party led by 
President Abbas) and Hamas. The violence that erupted in Gaza in early July 2014 and continued until the 
end of August has put a strain on the consensus government. Service delivery in Gaza is complicated by 
the existence of two distinct public services—one paid and managed by the PA in Ramallah, and the other 
by the de facto authority in Gaza—and the current arrangement is unsustainable.  

11. 
The situation in Gaza is extremely volatile. Even before the crisis, two thirds of the population 
of Gaza was receiving food assistance, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine ran 
eight refugee camps, with schools, medical centers and food distribution points, where more than half a 
million people (28 percent of the population) lived. All movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza 
has been restricted since June 2007 by both Israel and Egypt. Israeli restrictions have been eased since 
2010 for some construction materials, but exports are still virtually blocked from Gaza and must be 
destined for a third country (neither Israel nor the West Bank, which traditionally absorbed 85 percent of 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gaza’s exports.) However, there is little world demand for goods made in Gaza: a few fruits and flowers 
grown in a Dutch-supported project were exported to the Netherlands. The supply of basic necessities was 
restricted with Egypt’s 2013 clamp-down on the tunnel trade (movement of goods through illegal tunnels 
dug under the border between Gaza and Egypt) and prices rose sharply.  

12. 
The recent conflict in Gaza has created a humanitarian crisis and dramatically worsened 
the development challenges.  More than 2100 Palestinians died during the hostilities, and a third of the 
population was internally displaced.  The conflict resulted in massive destruction of infrastructure. 
According to the PA’s estimates, as presented in its report to the Cairo conference on Gaza 
reconstruction, the total damage is close to US$4 billion. These numbers, as well as proposals for 
implementation of reconstruction, are being refined in a full damage needs assessment led by the PA with 
support from the EU, UN and World Bank. Gaza reconstruction will require the PA to agree with the 
Government of Israel (GoI) on an effective entry and access system to allow critical construction 
materials into Gaza, and allowing reconstruction activities to be led by private contractors. The system 
would need to ensure entry of materials under the PA’s leadership, assuring the GoI and donors that 
building materials are used only for the purposes intended. The efficacy and efficiency of this system will 
significantly affect the time and cost of the reconstruction process, but also the accumulating economic 
impact of the conflict.  

B. 

Recent Economic Developments and Prospects 

13. 
The Palestinian economy was slowing down even before the Gaza conflict. Following a 
period of sustained economic recovery during 2007 to 2011 when average yearly growth exceeded 8 
percent, the economy has been struggling. The decline started in 2012 when the overall growth rate 
halved, falling to about 6 percent as a result of a sharp drop in foreign aid. This, against a backdrop of 
ongoing Israeli restrictions and high political uncertainty, led to a significant fall in public and private 
consumption which caused growth rates to continue their decline, down to only 1.9 percent in 2013. The 
economic situation significantly deteriorated in 2014 and preliminary estimates by the Palest ine Central 
Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) indicate that the economy fell into recession in the first quarter of 2014 with 
growth amounting to -1 percent (0.5 percent in the West Bank and -4 percent in Gaza).  The sharp drop in 
Gaza’s growth was primarily caused by the closures of the tunnels with Egypt, which represented the 
main trade channel for imports and exports for Gaza.    

14. 
The economic decline is resulting in growing unemployment. Unemployment reached 26 
percent by the middle of 2014: 16 percent of the workforce in the West Bank and a staggering 45 percent 
in Gaza. At 40 percent each, women and youth have particularly high levels of unemployment. What is 
more, almost 23 percent of the workforce is employed by the public sector, an uncommonly high 
proportion that reflects the lack of dynamism in the private sector.  Labor force participation is low as 
outlined in Table 1 below.

15. 
Even though the Palestinian economy has made considerable progress towards the twin 
goals of eradicating extreme poverty and shared prosperity, challenges remain both on poverty and 
inequality.  The share of people living on less than US$1.25 a day is less than 1 percent and between 
2004 and 2009 (the latest period where numbers are available), the annual per capita income growth of 
the bottom 40 percent of 
the population slightly outpaced the average per capita 
income 
growth.  However, the $1.25 poverty line is not appropriate for the Palestinian situation, as evidenced by 
25.8 percent living in poverty in 2011(latest data available) according to the national, basic-needs based 
poverty line.  In addition, a GINI coefficient of 40.3 percent indicates a significant level of income 
inequality in the Palestinian territories.  

16. 
Israeli restrictions1 on economic activity, in particular those on trade, movement and access, 
are a binding constraint to economic and social progress. These restrictions substantially increase the 
cost of trade and make it impossible to import many production inputs into the Palestinian territories. As 
described above, the restrictions on import and export and on movement of people for Gaza are 
particularly severe. In addition to the restrictions on labor movement between the Palestinian territories, 
the restrictions on movement of labor within the West Bank have been shown to have a strong impact on 
employability, wages, and economic growth. Moreover, Israeli restrictions render much economic activity 
very difficult or impossible to conduct in Area C, comprising 61 percent of the West Bank territory. A 
recent report by the Bank assessed that removal of Area C restrictions would permit an increase in 
Palestinian GDP by an estimated 35 percent.  

17. 
Even before the recent fighting, Gaza’s economy had been unsustainable due to recurring 
conflict and blockade on exports and imports.  Economic activity was paralyzed and infrastructure 
damaged during multiple episodes of conflict.  In the past decade, manufacturing sector employment 
plummeted from 9 percent to 5 percent mainly from the loss of main export markets (Israel and the West 
Bank).  Gaza’s labor force productivity is lower than that in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem, mainly 
because firms there are able to invest less in capital goods. The destruction caused by a series of conflicts 
in recent years, and in particular the last conflict, has seriously reduced the productive capacity of Gaza’s 
economy.

Gaza’s energy crisis has become the primary binding constraint for firms there, second only 
to political instability, resulting from long-term generation capacity deficits and poor distribution 

1  

According to the Government of Israel, these restrictions are for the purpose of enhancing the security of Israel and 
Israeli citizens.

infrastructure. The situation has worsened due to chronic fuel shortage and disruption of fuel supply from 
both Israel and Egypt.  Because they cannot afford their own generators, Gaza’s small and medium 
enterprises have been more adversely impacted by power outages (averaging around eight hours per day 
in 2013) than larger firms and those located in West Bank and East Jerusalem.  The damage to Gaza’s 
only power generating plant during the conflict has exacerbated the crisis. 

19. 
Despite the recession, the PA managed to keep its finances under control in the first half of 
2014. According to the MoF data, the PA’s recurrent deficit between January-June 2014 was 24 percent 
lower than its mid-year budget target mainly due to a better-than-expected outturn for revenues and 
expenditures. The PA has been making efforts to improve revenue performance and reduce the share of 
government expenditure in the economy. Efforts have been geared towards widening the tax base and 
collecting arrears and liabilities from delinquent tax payers. It has continued implementing a Revenue 
Strategy and Action Plan that puts emphasis on tax policy and enforcement measures. If the PA’s ongoing 
efforts to strengthen governance in Gaza succeed, tax revenues could increase significantly as the 
potential tax revenues from Gaza are close to 19 percent of the PA’s total revenues in 2013. No revenues 
currently collected for Gaza’s electricity bill are remitted to the PA, while the PA pays the entire 
electricity bill for Gaza as it is directly deducted by Israel from the PA’s revenues through the clearance 
process. If this were to change, the PA’s projected revenues would increase by at least US$200 million.  
The PA has placed control on the wage bill, which is the largest spending item representing more than 50 
percent of recurrent expenditures. In fact, the wage bill grew by less than 2 percent in 2013 mainly due to 
a zero net hiring policy that the PA has put in place since late 2012. Reducing net lending (utility 
subsidies) continues to be a key priority for the PA. The Bank has recently finalized a study that identifies 
the main drivers of this complex issue, something that was not done before. Based on the 
recommendations of the study, the PA has already taken some steps to reduce net lending. With support 
from USAID, a number of measures are also being implemented by the Ministry of Health (MoH) to 
improve the efficiency of health expenditures in particular through streamlining the costs of outside 
referrals.   

20. 
However, the PA’s fiscal position for the remainder of the year remains highly vulnerable 
due to spending pressures in Gaza. Year-end revenues are expected to be higher than previously 
anticipated due to stronger-than-expected growth in clearance revenues. However, expenditures are also 
expected to exceed forecasts on account of higher-than-expected non-wage spending and net lending. The 
total deficit is expected to amount to US$1.49 billion by the end of 2014 and aid to the public sector for 
recurrent and development spending is projected at US$1.48 billion, which is almost sufficient to cover 
the PA’s regular spending needs. Additional spending on reconstruction in Gaza, however, is expected to 
add significant fiscal pressures that may jeopardize the PA’s fiscal position if additional aid is not 
secured. 

21. 

Despite significant losses in Gaza, the banking sector remains healthy thanks to the efforts 
of the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA). The sector is well regulated by the PMA which has 
steadily been building the capabilities of a central bank. Banks in general are risk averse and profitable 
due to several reasons including cheap sources of deposits and healthy margins. The year -on-year growth 
of the sector’s net assets was 15 percent in June 2014, and its net income grew by 4 percent when 
compared to the same period last year. The banking sector has a high credit exposure to the Palestinian 
Authority and its employees, and the PMA is carefully monitoring related risks. The ratio of non -
performing loans to gross loans continues to be low at 3 percent; however, this is expected to increase due 
to the recent conflict as the capacity of some individuals and businesses to service their loan installments 
has significantly deteriorated. The PMA has already taken measures to deal with the effects of the latest 
conflict on the banking sector. It has recently reached an agreement with banks to reprogram loans 
(principal and interest payments) for six months and waive some fees for the people of Gaza. It has also 
reduced risk reserves from 2 percent of risk weighted assets to 0.5 percent.

Note: The PA has been repaying operational arrears and recording these payments as expenditures. This 
accounting misclassification was fixed in the table from 2014 onwards, but the lack of data on the exact amount of 
these payments in previous years prevented us from fixing this misclassification prior to 2014. 

22. 
Year-end GDP projections indicate that the Palestinian economy will shrink in 2014, but 
growth is expected to rebound in 2015. Projections indicate that the growth rate in the Palestinian 
territories will be about -4 percent in 2014 driven by the recession in Gaza and stagnation in the West 
Bank. Even though reconstruction efforts are expected to start reviving economic activity in Q4, this will 
not be enough to push Gaza’s economy out of recession, and hence, growth in Gaza is expected to be -15 
percent by the end of 2014. In the West Bank, the overall decline in the confidence level and the conflict 
in the city of Hebron that took place in June/July 2014 are expected to have had a damaging effect on 
economic activity during the first three quarters of the year. A slight recovery in Q4 is expected to push

full-year growth rates in the West Bank back to their 2013 level at around 0.5 percent. Encouragingly, 
growth in the Palestinian territories is expected to rebound to more than 4 percent in 2015 assuming that 
large amounts of aid will be channeled for reconstruction. Gaza’s economy is projected to grow by 11 
percent in 2015 while growth in the West Bank is expected to reach just over 2 percent. 

23. 
Despite having to incur additional expenditures to provide immediate assistance to the 
conflict-stricken people in Gaza, the PA is expected to continue reducing the deficit in the medium 
term.  Based on the current projections and thanks to unexpectedly strong revenue performance, the PA is 
expected to reduce its large stock of arrears to the private sector by roughly US$100 million in 2014, 
which will inject some liquidity into the struggling Palestinian private sector. The PA has also recently 
reduced its debt to local banks. The recurrent deficit is projected to keep falling over the medium term 
from 11 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 to 6 percent in 2017.  The overall deficit is also expected to 
drop from 12 percent to 10 percent over the same period. This declining deficit trend is in line with the 
IMF’s assessment. Notably, planned pension system reforms have not been implemented yet due to 
unconducive political economy and social pressures, which is resulting in significant contingent liabilities 
of about US$1.6 billion for the PA’s budget in the medium to long term. 

C. 

Arrangements for Assisting the West Bank and Gaza 

Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank 
24. 
To enable the Bank’s assistance to the Palestinian territories, a trust fund was established.  
The special arrangement was necessary to channel the Bank’s financial assistance because being neither a 
member of the IMF nor the World Bank made the PA ineligible for the sources of financing normally 
available to member countries. First, by Resolutions No. 93-11 and IDA 93-7, a trust fund (then called the 
Trust Fund for Gaza) was established in 1993 and US$50 million was transferred from IBRD surplus. 
Two years later, in August 1995, the Board of Governors renamed it the Trust Fund for Gaza and the 
West Bank (TFGWB) as the territorial scope was modified to cover the area under the jurisdiction of the 
PA.  

West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund 
25. 
Another Trust Fund was established to enable political risk guarantees by MIGA. The West 
Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund (IGTF) was established in 1997 and offers foreign 
investors the coverage against political risks such as convertibility restrictions, expropriation, war and 
civil disturbance or even a breach of a commercial contract that the investor has entered with a 
government. In 2008, the US$ 26 million fund had a key operational regulation change and was able to 
offer political risk insurance to both foreign and local investors. This departed from MIGA's standard 
cover, which applies to cross-border investments. As of September 2013, the IGTF had issued US$18.3 
million worth of guarantees. With the remaining trust fund capacity at US$7.7 million and formal 
applications requiring over US$13 million worth of guarantees currently being underwritten, the IGTF is 
currently unable to accept any new projects until it is replenished.  

Mobilization of Donor Funding 
26. 
The Bank’s assistance from the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank leverages 
substantial complementary resources from donors. In recent years, the TFGWB has been annually 
replenished by $55 million from the IBRD surplus. Investment grants from this trust fund leverage 
substantial (3.8 times) project financing from development partners. (Trust Funds contributed by donors 
that complement grants from the TFGWB are listed in Annex 2). The Bank’s DPGs (typically US$40 
million) from the TFGWB leverage four to five times their amount through the Bank-administered 
Palestinian Reform and Development Plan Multi-donor Trust Fund. Australia, France, Japan, Kuwait, 
Norway and UK are currently active donors to this trust fund, which provides budgetary support to the 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
PA’s reform agenda and supports the same policy areas identified in the DPGs. The Bank monitors the 
PA’s progress against priority economic and institutional and policy actions that it jointly identifies with 
the PA for the purpose of the most recent DPG. It makes regular disbursements, every quarter, upon 
assurance of satisfactory progress of the PA’s reform agenda.  

27. 
Other trust funds contributed by donors complement the Bank’s operations.  
 
To pool donors’ support for infrastructure, a Bank-administered multi-donor trust fund (TF) for 
infrastructure development was established in 2012 with contributions from Denmark, Finland and 
Sweden.  The aim of the TF is to improve the coverage, quality, and sustainability of infrastructure in the 
WB & G through financial and technical assistance to the PA in the water, urban development, and 
energy sectors.  To date the TF has received over US$40 million in donor contributions. 
 
A trust fund financed by Norway (US$3.5 million) has supported analysis of economic and 
sociopolitical developments. A successor trust fund, also funded by Norway, continues this engagement 
and support analytical and technical assistance in the areas of public and private institutions, gender, 
governance, environment and infrastructure development. 

28. 
Donors find World Bank-administered trust funds useful mechanisms to channel their 
assistance, and are utilizing these for Gaza reconstruction. Budget support to the PA from Australia, 
France, Japan, Norway and the UK is flowing through the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan 
Multi-donor Trust Fund (described above). Denmark, Sweden, and Finland are supporting infrastructure 
restoration and service delivery through the multi-donor infrastructure trust fund, and several other donors 
(including France and the Netherlands) have recently expressed their intent to provide additional 
contributions through this mechanism.  

29. 
Donor resources have helped mitigate the PA’s repayment burden of accumulated debt to 
IDA. This debt resulted from the World Bank assistance provided during the period 1999-2003 on IDA 
terms instead of grants provided currently. The World Bank has established a trust fund (Debt Relief 
Trust Fund for the Palestinian Authority) to provide temporary debt relief to the PA from March 1, 2013 
until February 29, 2016 with respect to the outstanding credits from the TFGWB on IDA terms. The 
amount mobilized is being used to buy down 100 percent of the annual principal repayment obligations 
over the three-year debt relief period and 46 percent of the annual service charges. 

III. 

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE OF THE PORTFOLIO 

A. Experience of the Previous Interim Strategy (FY 2012-14) 

30. 
The previous interim strategy, jointly prepared by IFC and the World Bank, was organized 
around two pillars: 

 
To strengthen the institutions of a future state to efficiently manage public finances and 
ensure services to citizens, and; 
 
To support the creation of an enabling environment for private sector led growth.  

The pillars were closely aligned with the four blocks of the Palestinian National Development Plan (2011-
13): the first pillar with the 2011-13 NDP’s ‘governance’ and ‘social’ blocks, and the second pillar with 
the ‘economy’ and ‘infrastructure’ blocks. 

31. 
The Bank Group’s goal of poverty reduction was addressed by the FY 2012-14 interim 
strategy, while the shared prosperity goal was indirectly addressed.  The Bank’s budget support 
operation, and the donor resources that it leveraged, along with the focus on macro-fiscal strengthening 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and public financial management, helped the PA free up resources in order to provide basic services. 
Under the strategy’s first pillar, extremely poor Palestinians were assisted by the World Bank and 
European Union through the Cash Transfer Program, and technical assistance to refine targeting of the 
households that deserve to receive this assistance.  

32. 

IFC’s strategy was driven by ‘staying the course’ with feasible expansion when 
opportunities arose, and therefore focused on investing in sectors that are not as severely 
constrained as others by the restrictions imposed on movement and access. IFC concentrated on 
financial markets (including microfinance) and infrastructure sector (with a focus on telecommunication). 
This strategy enabled IFC to increase its program, with a total of US$175 million (including mobilization) 
being invested by IFC and other investors that IFC brought into the Palestinian territories during the 
strategy period. 

33. MIGA undertook a major business development outreach during the previous strategy’s 
implementation period, after a period of stagnation that followed the second intifada (2000 to 2004).  
With an improvement in the overall investment environment, MIGA complemented IFC’s role in 
attracting private sector investors by providing political risk insurance.  It insured four projects in the 
amount of $7.8 million in agro-industries and manufacturing sectors. As of July, 2014, MIGA has 
conducted an initial preliminary review of 25 projects for US$130 million in investments, and guaranteed 
seven projects for a total of US$18.3 million. 

34. 
A robust set of demand-driven Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) provided policy 
advice. The Bank’s analysis of development challenges through the lens of economic development has 
helped frame the PA’s development agenda as well as those of the donor community and other 
stakeholders. During the last strategy period and through consultation with the PA, the World Bank 
Group produced a mix of reports, policy notes and technical assistance that includes:  

 
The West Bank and Gaza Sources of Growth reviewed the issues faced by the Palestinian 
economy and identified the steps necessary to set the stage of dynamic private sector growth;  
 
The Investment Climate Assessment sought to provide empirical analysis of the investment 
climate under which Palestinian businesses operate, described the key constraints, and identified reform 
priorities for those aspects of the investment climate and constraints which are within the PA’s control. 
 
Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy assessed the extent to which the restrictions 
imposed by the Government of Israel on economic activity in Area C of the West Bank impacts overall 
investment opportunities and growth of the Palestinian economy.  
 
International Good Practices in State-NGO Relations: A Benchmark for West Bank and Gaza and 
Social Accountability in Municipal Services focused on better understanding the services provided to 
private citizens by municipalities and NGOs.  
 
Efficiency of Universal Health Coverage analyzed how to increase efficiency of public health 
expenditures with a view to ensuring fiscal and financial sustainability of proposed universal health 
coverage.   
 
A Study on Microwork supported job creation and poverty reduction in the virtual economy 
through microwork (internet-based outsourcing of back-office functions) 
 
Twice yearly, the Bank reported on Palestinian economic development to the Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee of Donors to the Palestinian Authority. (The World Bank is secretariat to this body which is 
chaired by Norway.) 
 
IFC’s advisory activities mainly provided capacity building to private companies to improve 
access to finance and strengthening the financial sector. These included building capacity in local banks, 
advancing corporate governance, and developing leasing, providing support to Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs), microfinance, bank risk management, secured lending, and housing finance sub -

9 

 
 
 
 
 
sectors.  In FY14, IFC signed an agreement to help Bank of Palestine expand its outreach to SMEs with a 
focus on women. IFC’s advisory services supported the first public private partnership in solid waste 
management in the West Bank.  

35. 
Projects financed from the TFGWB continued to meet their development objectives in FY 
2013-14. The portfolio’s performance was reviewed twice during the previous strategy implementation 
period. If projects went into “problem” status they were restructured -- such as the now closed Village and 
Neighborhood project which had become a problem project in FY 12. Additional financing was used as 
an instrument of choice since it has allowed the Bank to respond rapidly to emerging priorities: projects 
that delivered results on the ground received additional funds to expand the scope of work or to cover 
financing gaps (e.g. Municipal Development project, Cash Transfer project, Palestinian NGO project.)   

36. 
A MNA-wide initiative to make greater use of ICT for citizens’ engagement and monitoring 
was introduced in the program in FY 14 and will be scaled up as new entry points are identified. An 
improved grievance redress mechanism in two pilots (one each in the West Bank and in Gaza) is planned 
in the Cash Transfer Project Additional Financing, with possible scale-up to other governorates depending 
on the context and possible entry points. Tools for citizens’ engagement developed for the Local 
Governance and Services Improvement Program include disclosure and development of local 
development strategic plans, the design of voluntary project support groups, and a grievance redress 
mechanism for the overall projects so that citizens can provide feedback on the quality of services 
provided and local government units’ (LGUs’) responsiveness and efficiency. Project teams are exploring 
the use of citizen surveys using mobile technology.  Identifying which projects lent themselves to this 
new tool (e.g. the second Municipal Development project and Education to Work Transition project) was 
part of the recent review of the country portfolio’s performance.  

B. Lessons of Implementation Experience 

37. 
The Palestinian territories program benefits from a continuous process of reviews and 
assessments. A retrospective of the FY 2012-14 ISN was discussed by the Country Team on March 6, 
2014 and drew the following lessons from implementation experience, which motivated the guiding 
principles of this strategy. 

 
The program’s selectivity principle has served it well. The Bank continued to lead the dialogue 
in the water sector where it has maintained an active presence for the past fifteen years, postponing 
engagement in the health sector until the dialogue was sufficiently advanced, and not engaging in the 
agriculture, transport and justice sectors where others were better placed to provide support . The program 
had mixed results in areas that were new to the program. Re-engaging in the land administration sector 
after six years, a second land administration project was approved in 2012 but shows moderately 
unsatisfactory results and is in the process of being restructured following its mid-term review. IFC’s 
focused and selective approach helped support the private sector in a financially sustainable , high impact 
manner. IFC will continue this selective approach and expand engagements in new sectors depending on 
the improvement in the overall environment.  
 
The volatility of the operating environment requires continuous monitoring . Close 
monitoring ensures that rapid adjustments to the portfolio can be made in response to emergencies, 
deterioration in operating conditions or changes in government or donor priorities. The program’s 
operating environment was hindered by outbreaks of conflict (e.g. Gaza in November 2012) , social unrest 
in September 2012 in reaction to price increases and civil servants’ strikes in October 2012 due to delayed 
salary payments. Only nine of the twenty targeted results were achieved. The protracted financial crisis 
affected outcomes of the first pillar (institutional strengthening for service delivery), where four of the six 

10 

 
 
 
  
 
 
targeted results in the areas of revenue and expenditure management and public financial management 
were not met.  
 
The restrictions on access also impeded the progress of Bank Group financed investments. 
As Israel does not allow free entry of construction materials into Gaza and places severe constraints on 
“dual-use” items both for Gaza and the West Bank, implementing projects required the World Bank’s 
intensive coordination with Israeli authorities and collaboration with donor partners. Despite intensive 
efforts, implementation of the ongoing Northern Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment project and Gaza 
Electricity Network Rehabilitation project has been delayed. Movement and access restrictions impeded 
IFC’s investment in the second mobile operator’s expansion plans into Gaza where telecommunications 
equipment was denied entry for more than two years.  
 
Program implementation adhered to the ISN’s commitment to remaining sensitive to 
gender integration across the portfolio and tracking project achievements by gender wherever 
possible. Of the eight investment projects that were approved by the Board during the previous strategy’s 
implementation, gender disaggregated data is being tracked in seven, and as core sector indicator in five 
of them. IFC has sought to address the gender gap through the financial sector, using both its investment 
and advisory arms. Women constitute 55 percent of the client base of Faten, where IFC has microfinance 
investment. In its advisory work with the Bank of Palestine, IFC supports women-owned businesses and 
women entrepreneurs. 

IV. THE PA’S PROGRAM AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. The Palestinian National Development Plan (NDP) 2014 to 2016 

38. 

The proposed Assistance Strategy has been prepared within the overall framework of the 
NDP 2014-16, which has its overall objectives outlined as “Palestinian sovereignty and realizing 
economic potential, steadfastness and resistance, national unity ending the internal divide, fighting 
poverty and unemployment, effective public institutions and fiscal stability.” The NDP is built upon 
sector strategies that were consulted broadly with public and private sectors and civil society 
organizations, and informed by the experience of the previous (2011-13) NDP. The World Bank and other 
international organizations had the opportunity to review the draft strategy and to provide suggestions. 
The draft plan was posted on the website of Ministry of Planning and Administrative Development to 
allow public access and comments.  

39. 
The NDP’s major thrust is similar to that of the previous National Development Plan for 
2012 to 2014. Good Governance and Institution Building, Social Protection, Economic Development and 
Employment and Infrastructure are the four blocks that define the present NDP. The PA’s emphasis on 
jobs is reflected in the expansion of the previous NDP’s Economic Development block to include 
employment creation. 

40. 
The Assistance Strategy’s pillars are aligned with the NDP’s blocks. Pillar 1 is aligned with 
the NDP’s Good Governance / Institution Building and Social Protection blocks, while Pillar 2 is aligned 
with the Economic Development and Employment and Infrastructure blocks.  

B. 

Development Challenges 

41. 
Poverty programs have been effective in reducing poverty. The PA’s social programs 
(including one of the best cash transfer programs in the region, developed with Bank and EU support) 
have reduced poverty significantly. For instance, simulations carried out in 2011 show that the poverty 
rate would have been 11 percentage points higher in the absence of these programs. 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
42. 
Inequality and shared prosperity remain an issue driven by employment status, regional 
disparities, gender and type of employment: 
 
Poverty rates are highly correlated with employment status and thus with the overall low growth 
of the private sector; 
 
Wide regional disparities still exist between Gaza and the West Bank, with unemployment and 
poverty rates at least twice as high in Gaza; 
 
While gender issues are well-addressed in the education system, very few women are 
working.  Less that 35 percent of women of working age are active in the labor force and , of those, 40 
percent are unemployed, resulting in only one in five women of working age actually be ing employed; 
and 
 
Household income depends on the type of employment with poverty rates among households 
where the head works in the public sector ten percentage points below those headed by an employee in 
the private sector. Similarly, poverty rates for households where the head works in the Israeli private 
sector is lower. 

Box 1. Progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 

The PA has a national strategy to meet the MDG targets by 2015. It is complementary to the National Development 
Plan, but focuses on areas targeted by the MDGs and defines the policies and interventions needed to achieve them.  
 
Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. Even though the proportion of Palestinians whose income is 
below US$1.25 is extremely small, a quarter of Palestinians live in poverty according to the national poverty line 
with the rate in Gaza being twice that in the West Bank (2011 data). 
 
Achieve universal primary education. According to the Ministry of Education, net enrolment in basic 
education rose from 87.5% in 1994-95 to 93.1% for males and 95.9% for females in 2013. Although school 
enrolment has increased in recent years and almost universal literacy has been achieved, student performance 
according to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) scores is only around the regional 
average, with significant room for improvement. 
 
Promote gender equality and empower women. Girls outnumber boys (118%) in secondary education. 
Female participation in the labor market at 18%, however, continues to be much lower than male participation at 
70%. The average daily wage for females is 6% lower than that of males. The proportion of seats held by women in 
local councils also increased from 2% in 2000 to 18% in 2010. However, a large proportion of married women 
continue to suffer from violence the PA has recently joined “The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women” which commits the PA to undertake a series of measures to end discrim ination 
against women in all forms.  
 
Reduce child mortality. The under-five mortality rate was 16.2 per 1000 live births in 2012, with the main 
causes of infant deaths in the West Bank prenatal diseases, congenital malformations and blood poisoning. Child 
mortality rates are significantly higher in Gaza compared to the West Bank.  
 
Improve maternal health. Maternal mortality was 23 cases in 2012. Deliveries under the supervision of 
qualified health teams in the same year reached 98.4%.  
 
Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. The HIV/AIDS infection levels in the Palestinian 
territories are extremely low. There have been no reported cases of cholera, rabies, malaria or poliomyelitis in many 
years.  
 
Ensure environmental sustainability. The proportion of land area covered by forest in 2010 was only 
1.63% of the overall Palestinian territories. Only around 13% of wastewater is treated and a limited 30% of solid 
waste is dumped in landfill sites in a sanitary manner. The per capita share of water is below the standard 
recommended by the World Health Organization.

43. 
The Gaza situation has introduced additional development challenges on the PA. To obtain 
donors’ assistance, the PA is preparing a credible, comprehensive and well-coordinated estimate of 
damages, losses and needs. This will need to be a bottom-up approach, capturing information about the 
effects of the conflict, sector by sector, and aggregating these data to arrive at the total effect on the 

12 

 
 
 
 
economy and society. To address the priorities identified, strong PA coordination of its development 
partners, based on their comparative advantages and ongoing sector engagements , would be necessary. 
The PA would also need to agree with the GoI on a new system for accessing the materials that would 
enable it to lead reconstruction activities through private contractors.  The new system would need to 
allow for efficient and speedy reconstruction by private sector entities under the PA’s leadership; and 
assuring the GoI and donors that building materials are used only for the purposes intended.   

V. DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED ENGAGEMENT (FY2015 – 16) 

A. Guiding Principles 

44. 
Four principles guide the Bank Group’s work in the Palestinian territories. A sustained 
focus on technical work in a highly politicized environment; selectivity based on comparative advantages; 
flexibility; and enhanced focus on jobs.  These principles drive both the “regular” engagement as well as 
emergency operations such as those currently under preparation for Gaza. 

45. 
The Bank Group exercises a technical mandate in an intensely political environment, and 
analyzes development challenges through the lens of economic development. As it has since 1993, the 
Bank Group’s program will continue to focus on laying the foundation for a future Palestinian state by 
relying on WBG comparative advantages – focus on longer term development issues, convening influence 
with development partners, and sector expertise. The Bank’s apolitical stance helps coordinate with all 
parties concerned. 

46. 
The Bank Group’s program will continue to remain selective in deploying expertise in sectors 
where it has a history of engagement and has a comparative advantage. The series of budget support 
operations will continue to concentrate on fiscal strengthening and public financial management, and will 
be complemented by investment projects in higher education, local government, energy, water, and 
municipal development. These will directly benefit the poorest 40 percent as they depend more on public 
services than the rest of the population.  In sectors like primary education, agriculture, transport, ICT and 
justice the Bank will follow other donors’ lead. (Annex 3 summarizes donors’ support to different 
sectors.)  Driven by its mandate, the Bank will continue to be comprehensive and strategic in analytical 
work that helps set the development agenda for the PA and the donor community. Private sector job 
creation will support shared prosperity 
through World Bank 
investments complemented by 
IFC continuing its focus on financial and infrastructure sectors, and looking to expansion in other sectors 
if the operating environment for the private sector improves and opportunities arise. 

47. 
Flexibility--along with a balance between short and medium term needs--will continue to 
drive the Bank Group’s program. The Bank supports the long term structural reforms to build the 
foundation for a strong Palestinian administration. The current environment of uncertainty makes it even 
more important to continue this stream of support. Equally, the program will need to be flexible to adapt 
to sudden changes in a very fragile operating environment. Project designs will be simple, with reliance 
on Additional Financing to scale up assistance to bolster successful components of tested interventions. 
IFC will use a mix of debt, equity and guarantees as instruments of engagement on the investment side.  

48. 
Following the NDP’s lead, the program will place increased attention on jobs. Unable to 
directly create a significant number of jobs in the economy, the Bank and IFC will take follow-up actions 
on the findings of the recently completed assessment of the investment climate. A programmatic dialogue 
on job creation will continue during FY 15, and a private sector project under development will build on 
the results of the Investment Climate Assessment and focus on encouraging job opportunities and 
stimulating entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on youth and women.    

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
49. 
The Bank Group’s response to the Gaza situation is based on the same principles of 
selectivity and flexibility. To accommodate the PA’s request for assistance to Gaza, the FY 15 proposed 
program has been radically restructured.  First an emergency supplemental financing for the latest DPG 
will help finance the PA’s additional recurrent expenditures related to the Gaza situation, primarily in the 
social sectors.  In addition, as mentioned earlier , three emergency additional financings are proposed in 
three sectors where the Bank has experience in Gaza: water, electricity and municipal services. Two 
pipeline operations for health and wastewater treatment in Hebron will also be presented.  While the PA 
appreciates the Bank’s ability to re-program assistance, it has expressed serious concerns about the need 
to postpone key operations in infrastructure, jobs as well as the planned DPG VII to next fiscal year, 
given the limit on financing available in the trust fund.  Without additional funds available for FY16, the 
program will have to be significantly reduced even in the core sectors where the Bank is taking the lead. 
IFC is exploring the possibility of structuring a lending facility with the banking sector that benefits from 
a grant component essential to providing risk mitigation measures needed to provide access to finance for 
the private sector in both in Gaza and the West Bank. IFC will leverage its engagement with the Bank of 
Palestine, which has the largest portfolio exposure to the private sector in Gaza, and with Wataniya 
Mobile Company, which is waiting for the necessary approvals and frequencies to be able to launch its 
operations in Gaza. 

B. Proposed Program 

50. 
Based on these principles and reflecting the PA’s priorities reflected in the NDP, the two pillars 
of this strategy are: 

 

 

Strengthen the institutions of a future state to ensure service delivery to citizens, aligned with 
the governance and institution building, and social protection blocks of the NDP. 
Support private sector led growth that increases employment opportunities, aligned with the 
economic development and employment, and infrastructure blocks of the NDP. 

51. 

The strategy builds on the key elements of MNA’s regional strategy (jobs, growth, inclusion, 
and governance). For example, in the growth and governance areas the Bank will focus on state and 
institution building through macro-fiscal strengthening and public financial management (pillars of the 
ongoing series of Development Policy Grants) in order to free up resources for ensuring service delivery 
and shared prosperity. On inclusion, the Cash Transfer projects will ensure social protection of the very 
poor. 

52. 
The Bank will continue to pursue a long-term development agenda while measuring interim 
results.  The challenge is to keep the focus on the longer term state and private sector building agendas, 
while measuring interim indicators to ensure that the proposed engagement is on the right track.  In the 
consultations with private and public stakeholders, there is a continued call for the Bank Group to focus 
on the big picture and the longer term development agenda through strategic analytical and advisory work 
as well as strategic investments in reform and service delivery.  At the same time, the high degree of 
uncertainty in the program makes it essential to measure progress on a shorter time frame. IFC’s counter-
cyclical role in supporting private investments into the Palestinian territories while other investors remain 
on the sidelines is an indication of its role as a long-term investor. IFC will continue to play this role of 
signaling the long-term potential of both territories, and partner with domestic and foreign investors 
willing to endure the high short-term risks associated with investing there.  Thus, the outcomes stated in 
tables below are those interim ones that can be measured, but they form part of a longer term, more 
strategic framework. 

14 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Pillar 1. Strengthen the institutions of a future state to ensure service delivery to citizens 

53. 
The ultimate goal of this pillar is to assist the PA improve delivery of services, and to help 
Palestinians reap the benefits of the state building measures .  In its 2011 report to the Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee, the World Bank concluded that Palestinian public institutions compare favorably with those 
in the region and beyond. Under this pillar of the strategy, the Bank will help the PA ensure that this 
success translates into improved services for all Palestinians.  Our development policy grants will 
continue to facilitate expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor and development expenditures, while a 
series of specific measures will focus on three sub-goals.  The sub-goals are restricted to what can be 
measured in the brief period of this strategy but form a part of the longer terms state-building agenda that 
is essential for a sustainable Palestinian society.

Outcome 1.1:   Improved fiscal management with a focus on health and electricity sectors 
54. 
Three strands of Bank assistance will help the PA achieve this first outcome of Pillar 1: general 
strengthening of public financial management practice as well as targeted expenditure management in the 
health and electricity sectors where savings maybe possible.  

55. 
The PA’s fiscal management practices will be strengthened.  Being able to manage public 
finances strengthens the PA’s ability to prevent a roll-back of the gains made in institution-building and 
thereby losing what has been painstakingly achieved over the past years.  

 
The Bank, along with the IMF and other partners, will support fiscal strengthening through 
regular policy dialogue, annual development policy and investment operations and AAA. Particularly, the 
sixth Development Policy Grant is supporting policies to boost internally collected revenues and 
containment of the size of the wage bill.  
 
The Bank is helping the PA analyze the cost efficiency and sustainability of public service 
provision, in particular for education, health, electricity and social welfare services; and the fiscal 
implications of internal reconciliation through the Bank's ongoing programmatic Public Expenditure 
Review.  
 
The Bank’s 2013 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA), 
conducted in partnership with donor partners, found progress in comprehensiveness (no extra budgetary 
funds), transparency (budgets documents made public and containing a lot of information), controls ( ex-
ante control by financial controllers for budget and compliance controls) and audit (SAACB methodology 
and capacity, and recently built internal audit). Weaknesses identified in other areas will be strengthened, 
in particular budget execution (no cash planning, arrears generating, no commitment control , see 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monitoring indicator 1) and accounting/reporting (mostly on accuracy grounds despite timeliness of 
monthly reports and near-GFS compliance).  
 
The 2011 financial statements are yet to be issued, and there were a number of “qualifications” in 
the 2010 financial statements audited in 2013. Financial reporting (see monitoring indicator number 2) 
will be strengthened to better manage the costs and pricing of public service provision and move towards 
better performance and value-for-money. The Bank will help further strengthen the capacity of the State 
Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB), one of the best state audit institutions in the Arab 
world.  
 
The Bank coordinates its support to the public financial management agenda with other donor 
partners. While helping strengthen the downstream side of the budget cycle (budget execution, GFMIS, 
accounting and reporting), DfID will continue to support the budget preparation cycle (program budgeting 
and performance), and the EU the internal and external audit functions. 
 
Municipalities’ financial management capacity will be built through the ongoing second 
Municipal Development Project by gradually rolling-out an Integrated Financial Management and 
Information System in selected municipalities.  

56. 
The PA will become better at managing its health expenditures.  In particular, expenditure for 
treating patients outside the Palestinian system—usually in tertiary care—have grown more than ten times 
between 2000 and 2011 (from 8,123 referrals in 2000 costing under US$10 million to 56,468 in 2011 
costing US$125 million), and constituted 36 percent of MoH expenditures in 2011 and 40 percent in 
2012. The referral system is plagued by weak management and old/inconsistent contracts with health care 
providers outside of the Palestinian facilities and has resulted in accumulated unpaid bills to outside 
providers of around US$18 million. In response to a request from the PA, a proposed TA project would 
aim to help the MoH implement the policy recommendations from recent Bank-supported analysis and 
covering areas that could potentially include: assessment of cost effectiveness of developing national 
capacity for treatment against outside referrals for key conditions, technical assistance for rationalizing 
and organizing referrals and the development of a Referral Manual, establishing a system for contract 
management and in-service training for physicians (see monitoring indicator number 3). 

57. 
The PA will improve management of electricity expenditures. Non-payment of electricity bills 
by end consumers as well as municipalities, village councils, and Distribution Companies has led to 
increasing arrears owed to the Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) – the principal supplier of electricity to 
the Palestinian territories. The Government of Israel deducts these arrears from the VAT that it collects on 
behalf of the PA. The PA has introduced a unified electricity tariff, and the Bank’s ongoing projects will 
consolidate supply of electricity from IEC through four major substations. An investment project under 
development will help improve payments for electricity by implementing the recommendations identified 
through the Bank’s ongoing analysis of electricity payments, reducing system losses, improving system 
performance, continue to consolidate supply and, implement a broader range of energy efficiency 
measures (see monitoring indicator 4). It will also help improve the PA’s energy security and control of 
electricity supply by supporting renewable energy implementation.  The push for cost recovery will need 
to be suspended in the short term for Gaza, given the humanitarian crisis.. 

Outcome 1.2:   Increased transparency and accountability in service delivery 
58. 
Three strands of Bank assistance will help the PA achieve this second outcome. First, 
municipalities will adopt practices that make them more accountable. Second, agencies at the apex level 
of the PA as well as NGOs will have improved transparency in their delivery of services. Third, 
transparency in government-wide purchase of goods and services will be increased through continued 
improvement of the procurement system. 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
59. 
Local governments’ accountability in service delivery will be improved. Municipal 
management practices for better municipal accountability and service delivery is being supported by the 
Bank’s ongoing municipal development program (see monitoring indicator number 5). While (the larger) 
municipalities have been strengthened and accessed funds for service delivery, smaller local government 
units (LGUs) and Village Councils have not benefited from the ongoing support. Thus, an investment 
project will strengthen capacity of small LGUs and Joint Service Councils (JSCs) in upgrading both their 
technical capacity and efficacy for citizen engagement and gender inclusion. It will provide incentives for 
small LGUs to coalesce and collaborate to jointly provide services such as solid waste collection and 
transport, extension and/ or rehabilitation of existing water supply and sewage networks, rehabilitation of 
inter-village roads.  

60. 
Service delivery and regulatory agencies at the apex level will become more transparent in 
their transactions. The ongoing Second Land Administration project will assist the Palestinian Land 
Authority (PLA) ensure efficient and transparent land registration operations (see monitoring indicator 
number 6). The PLA, along with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing, the Municipal Development 
and Lending Fund and the Ministry of Local Government will be strengthened as part of an investment 
project to augment municipal capacity for integrated urban planning and increasing the supply of 
affordable housing on a pilot basis in more densely populated areas. On the NGO side, the Bank’s 
ongoing NGO project will incentivize NGOs delivering services to comply with the NGOs’ Code of 
Conduct including financial reporting and hiring practices (see monitoring indicator number 7). 

61. 
The public procurement systems will be strengthened through the adoption of policy reform 
actions supported by the series of Development Policy Grants and through a targeted investment project 
under development.  This will include institution building of the Higher Council for Public Procurement 
Policies and the two central procurement entities (Central Tenders Department at MOPWH and General 
Supplies Department of the Ministry of Finance), strengthening the capacity of the State Audit and 
Administrative Control Bureau for carrying out procurement audits establishing the dispute review units, 
establishing framework agreements, in particular for common-use goods and services, issuing sector-
specific national standard bidding documents(e.g. pharmaceuticals, textbooks, ICT); and putting in place 
a framework for data collection, monitoring and performance bench marking of the procurement system 
(see monitoring indicator number 8.) 

Outcome 1.3:   Improved access to services by the poor and marginalized. 
62. 
Three strands of Bank assistance will help the PA’s effort to extend public services to a greater 
proportion of the poor and marginalized. First, the Bank will help strengthen NGOs’ service delivery. 
Second, the Bank will help the PA target assistance to the most poor. Third, to alleviate the suffering in 
Gaza, Bank interventions will focus on specific improvements to water supply and sanitation services.  

63. 
NGOs’ effectiveness in delivering services will be enhanced. Strong Palestinian charitable 
organizations emerged in the 1960s in the absence of a state, and currently NGOs provide a wide array of 
social services in health, agriculture, early childhood development, mental health, education, care for the 
elderly, environment and services for people with special needs, often supplementing and augmenting 
services provided by the PA. The Bank will continue to support institutionalization of a transparent and 
effective system for identifying NGOs providing critical services, providing them with grants and targeted 
capacity building and effectively monitoring the implementation of these activities (see monitoring 
indicator number 9).   

64. 
Services to poor and marginalized communities will be further strengthened. The ongoing 
Palestinian NGO project will provide grants to NGOs for social service delivery to poor and vulnerable 
Palestinians in unserved and under-served areas. Through the ongoing Cash Transfer Project, the Wor ld 
Bank, alongside the European Union, will mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
subset of the extremely poor and most vulnerable households; and support the Palestinian Authority's 
efforts to target assistance to the most poor (see monitoring indicator number 10.)  

65. Water and sanitation services will be improved in the Gaza strip. A significant shortage of 
water services and a severe deterioration of public health are threatening the lives of Palestinians in Gaza , 
especially of the poor who cannot afford to purchase water from private vendors.  The situation in Gaza 
was already serious before the recent conflict with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that 
Gaza would run out of potable water by 2015. After the conflict, the PA-led assessment estimated that 
more than 80 percent of the water wells were not functioning and about 1.2 million people lacked access 
to water and sanitation services. In addition to ongoing projects, emergency project activities proposed for 
additional financing will rehabilitate damaged water infrastructure to restore basic water supply and 
wastewater services (see monitoring indicator number 11). The Bank’s interventions will help reduce the 
amount of time and financial resources spent by households in Gaza to manage the relatively limited 
supplies of water of variable quality. Wastewater treatment and disposal improvements will reduce the 
contamination of the aquifer on which most Gazans depend for their water supply leading to positive 
impacts on public health.  Although less dire than in Gaza, water and wastewater services are inadequate 
in the West Bank, with per capita water consumption well below WHO-guidelines and only 13 percent of 
wastewater being treated.  The Bank’s interventions will help improve water and wastewater services in 
the Hebron Governorate and a cluster of villages located in the west Bethlehem governorate.  

Pillar 2. Support private sector led growth that increases employment opportunities 

66. 
 Sustainable economic growth and social progress is dependent on a vibrant private sector. 
Private sector job creation is essential to support shared prosperity given the link between employment 
and well-being. The NDP’s ambitious aim to increase employment opportunities by 600,000 during the 
next ten years would require an annual growth rate of 10 percent, or four times the growth rate of 20132. 
The World Bank is not engaged in some of the sectors identified in the NDP for selectivity reasons (e.g. 
agriculture), nor will the World Bank Group’s initiatives lead to large scale job creation. Instead, the 
Bank Group will focus on four areas within its comparative advantage: 

 

 
Innovative approaches to job creation will be introduced by demonstrating untapped opportunities 
in hitherto unexplored sectors; and continuing to strengthen the link between businesses and tertiary 
education institutions so that graduates’ skills match the demands of the marketplace; 
 
IFC’s investments will help spur economic development and provide jobs.  
Infrastructure improvements in water, solid waste and energy will be supported. This will 
improve the business climate and thus support private sector job creation, in addition to directly providing 
employment for construction and maintenance.  Such investments in improved service delivery also 
support shared prosperity by disproportionally benefitting those in the bottom deciles of the income 
distribution;  
The financial sector will be broadened and deepened so that larger numbers of people have access 
to financial services including insurance.   

 

2 During the timetable of the (now-stalled) peace talks, several initiatives to boost the Palestinian economy had been announced. 
The most significant of these is the Economic Initiative for Palestine, declared by US Secretary of State John Kerry. The 
initiative was designed to empower and stimulate a large number of Palestinian and foreign investors to invest US$19 billion 
over the upcoming six years in a broad package of investments in eight vital sectors: construction and construction materials ; 
water; agriculture; industry, tourism; information and communication technology; and energy.

Outcome 2.1 Innovative approaches to job creation introduced 
67. 
Three strands of the Bank Group’s assistance will help the PA achieve this first outcome: identify 
sectors that have the potential to generate jobs without requiring heavy investment, expand employment 
opportunities that rely on technology, and closing the missing gap between skills that tertiary education 
institutions build and what the industry needs.  

68. 
In marginalized rural areas, employment in tourism will be supported. Although both public 
and private sectors are investing large amounts in developing the tourism industry, small communities in 
rural areas are not benefiting from these investments. The Abraham Path is the longest trail in the West 
Bank, attracting thousands of travelers. Combining walking in the West Bank with tourism and 
hospitality in local communities there, experiential tourism has the potential to create employment 
opportunities for homestay hosts, guides, transport providers, and local business owners. The Bank’s 
ongoing project will support the development of walking trails, while demonstrating the employment 
opportunities generated by experiential tourism in rural communities (see monitoring indicator number 
12.)  

69. 
Technology driven entrepreneurship and innovation will be expanded. ‘Microwork’ (online 
outsourcing) is one such area with significant potential to improve income generation opportunities and 
employment—requiring workers to have only computers and internet access for participation. In other 
parts of the world, this sector mainly employs those between the ages of 21 to 35 with a strong 
participation of women. A Bank project under development would conduct training for youth and women 
in online work and mobile computing; and provide training/education capacity in selected organizations, 
while providing matching and seed grants for local online work providers, brokers and intermediaries to 
launch online outsourcing (see monitoring indicator number 13). The Bank will also support higher 
education institutions’ development of curricula for building skills to take on microwork jobs . 

70. 

Tertiary education graduates’ skills will be more aligned to the market’s demands. 
Acquiring these skills will prepare trained workers for the private sector to recruit while addressing young 
Palestinians’ serious employment challenges. Unemployment rates among graduates from both university 
and secondary education institutions are above 60 percent at the age of graduation with only a slow 
decrease over time. As part of its Education For Employment (E4E) program, IFC is identifying areas 
(mainly in banking and ICT) where targeted skills development will meet the market’s needs, develop 
skills frameworks for these areas, establish public and private sector platforms to bridge the skills gap, 
and advocate private sector investment in education, which could also create possibilities for IFC 
investments. The Bank’s ongoing Education to Work Transition Project will continue to support 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transition of young Palestinians attending participating tertiary education institutions by fostering 
partnerships between those educational institutions and employers in order to make study programs more 
relevant to the needs of the labor market (see monitoring indicator number 14.)  

Outcome 2.2 Infrastructure improved to attract private sector investments 
71. 
Energy supply will be increased, including through restoring damaged networks in 
Gaza.  Sustainability within the sector will also addressed, and energy security will remain a significant 
focus – particularly through the development of renewable energy. 

 
The ongoing Gaza Electricity Network Rehabilitation project will continue to rehabilita te and 
expand the electricity networks in Gaza in order to improve reliability and performance.  However, 
Gaza’s electricity network was severely damaged during recent hostilities, affecting even basic levels of 
electricity supply.  Therefore, an emergency additional financing will finance reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of the damaged electricity infrastructure in Gaza (see monitoring indicator number 15). 
 
The ongoing Electric Utility Management project will continue to strengthen key energy sector 
institutions to enhance the performance of the sector.  A new operation, based on recent analysis of the 
electricity sector’s contribution to net lending, will seek to support improved payment for electricity, 
continue to consolidate electricity supply through Palestinian institutions, improve energy efficiency, and 
to improve the overall fiscal sustainability of the sector.  
 
The Bank will also continue to support increased energy security, particularly where energy 
supply supports other basic service provision. This will focus primarily on the development of indigenous 
energy resources, and in particular renewable energy.  The development of a strategy for renewable 
energy was supported by the Bank during the previous strategy period, and the PA’s Green Palestine 
initiative (led by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Palestinian Energy Authority) aims to create both 
high skill and low skill jobs from improved efficiencies in the use of natural resources. The Bank is also 
supporting the private development of a biogas plant at the Zahrat Al-Finjan landfill that could generate 
1.5 MW of electricity.  Meanwhile, inadequate and unreliable power supply in Gaza places at risk the 
operation of the sewage treatment plant constructed with Bank support. Thus, the Bank is assisting the 
Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority and the Palestinian Water Authority to confirm solar 
photovoltaic technology as the most optimal and feasible power supply option for the sewage treatment 
plant in North Gaza, and will continue to support the development of this option. If the opportunity arises, 
IFC will also explore options of participating in the renewable energy sector, primarily through PPPs. 
The Bank Group is also working together to increase private sector participation in the energy sector.  IFC 
is evaluating an investment opportunity in a new US$500 million 400MW power plant in Jenin, while the 
World Bank is seeking funds for a partial risk guarantee to support the same project.  This model of 
support could also be expanded to a range of other smaller renewable energy investments in the West 
Bank, and potentially also in Gaza. MIGA is considering support to equity investors of the power plant 
through reinsurance mobilization. 
 
Lastly, in the event that political constraints to the development of Gaza Marine gas are removed, 
the Bank will seek to increase engagement in support of strong and transparent governance of the 
Palestinian gas sector. 

72. 
The Palestinian telecommunications sector will be strengthened.  
 
Currently, IFC is the lead arranger and manager of the US$125 million syndicated loan to 
Wataniya Mobile Co., the second mobile operator in the Palestinian territories. It is also supporting the 
company’s launch of its operations in Gaza, which is expected to improve communication services and 
lower costs, as was witnessed in the West Bank.  Service in Gaza is expected to double the number of the 
company’s effective subscribers, which currently stands at more than half a million (see monitoring 
indicator number 16).   

20 

 
 
 
 
 

The top telecom sector priorities are the allocation by Israel of adequate spectrum frequencies for 
Palestinian mobile and broadband use, the establishment of an independent regulator along with the 
strengthening of the regulatory framework to ensure competitive growth, increase private participation 
and enable further job creation. Ongoing technical assistance from the World Bank is helping the PA 
assess its telecommunications sector in comparative perspective along with prices, availability of services, 
access and use, and the PA’s policies and regulations and main constraints hindering development and 
growth of the sector (see monitoring indicator number 17). 

73. 
The water and wastewater management sector will be more organized , more capable of 
securing water supply and rights for citizens, and materializing a fair distribution for all purposes. 
Improvements to water supply, wastewater treatment will lower the costs of doing business for the private 
sector, allow for reuse of waste water for irrigation and directly generate employment.  

 
The Bank’s Gaza Water Supply and Sewage System Improvement Project and the Water Supply 
and Sanitation Improvements for West Bethlehem Villages will improve water supply and wastewater 
services to vulnerable communities. 
 
To protect the underlying aquifer and supply irrigation water, effluent reuse from the Waste 
Water Treatment Plant in North Gaza (supported by the AFD and the World Bank) will recover water to 
irrigate agricultural land.  
 
In partnership with AFD, EC, and USAID the Bank’s Hebron Regional Wastewater Management 
Project (under development) will support Hebron municipality and the Palestinian Water Authority to 
treat domestic wastewater from Hebron City (in a first phase) and other communities (in subsequent 
phase) in order to make the treated effluent available for irrigation (see monitoring indicator number 18). 
Additional Financing to the Water Sector Capacity-Building project will strengthen the capacity 
of the Palestinian Water Authority and other stakeholders to more effectively plan, monitor, regulate, and 
implement water sector development both in Gaza and the West Bank. 

 

Outcome 2.3 Financial sector broadened and deepened. 
74. 
Three strands of the Bank Group’s assistance will help achieve this third outcome: increase the 
potential of MSMEs to generate income, develop mortgage financing, and provide political risk insurance 
to attract domestic and foreign investors.  

75. 
The enabling environment for Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs) will be 
further developed.  

 

 
A regional MSME TA facility will help enhance the capacity of MSMEs. The facility is jointly 
managed by IFC and the World Bank and currently supports MSME finance and development across 
seven countries in the MENA region.  
On the advisory side, IFC will continue to work with client banks to develop their SME finance 
products with a special focus on financing of women entrepreneurs.  
 
Building on its successful microfinance investment in Faten, IFC is looking to double its 
financing to the microfinance sector (see monitoring indicator number 19).   
 
Following the PA’s recent approval of the Leasing Law, IFC will work with the Capital Markets 
Authority to develop leasing regulations, help build the CMA’s capacity building and operationalize the 
movable assets registry and continue its support the development of the Secured Transaction Law.  
 
The Bank will help strengthen accounting capacity in general. In partnership with the Ministry of 
Women's Affairs and the Palestinian Association of Certified Public Accountants, the Bank will train 
women in book-keeping skills who will eventually provide bookkeeping services to MSMEs. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
76. Mortgage finance markets will be deepened by providing banks with financing, risk sharing 
facilities and IFC’s advisory services. IFC’s work with the PA’s AMAL (Affordable Mortgage and 
Loan) program is continuing, where origination guidelines were revised to be more in line with the 
market. The Palestinian Monetary Authority is providing capacity building to banks through the training 
program developed by IFC. IFC will continue to build on its existing portfolio of investments and 
advisory projects in the financial sector, which includes an equity investment in the Bank of Palestine, 
trade finance lines with three banks, and plans to explore opportunities to expand into Islamic Banking 
(see monitoring indicator number 20).   

77. MIGA will continue to provide political risk insurance cover, while the Bank and IFC are 
analyzing options and instruments for insuring investments. MIGA will seek to replenish the WB &G 
IGTF, fully allocated now, to continue supporting private sector activity (see monitoring indicator 
number 21). MIGA is also exploring reinsurance opportunities from regional institutions such as the Arab 
Export Credit and Investment Insurance (Dhaman) and Islamic Cooperation for Insuring Investments and 
Export Credit (ICIEC), as well as the private market. MIGA has recently established a trust fund to attract 
investments in fragile and conflict states, which could be used to complement IGTF, though only to 
foreign investors according to the terms of this trust fund.  

C. Cross-cutting Themes in Program Implementation 

78. 
The program will be closely coordinated with development partners through the Local 
Development Forum (LDF). The LDF includes representation from the PA as well as all donor and aid 
agencies, meets roughly once every six months, and has been chaired by the Palestinian Prime Minister 
since October 2007.  In addition, a number of sectoral working groups have also been established, each 
co-chaired by a donor and the relevant PA ministry or agency.   

79. 
The Bank Group will help build partnerships with the private sector.  Recently donors have 
shown greater interest in more coordinated support to private sector growth and job creation agenda, thus 
increasing the activity of the LDF’s Private Sector Working Group.   The public private partnership 
supported by the Southern West Bank Solid Waste Management project (construction by the PA and 
maintenance by a private operator) will serve as a model and reminder to seek similar opportunities 
throughout the portfolio. As mentioned earlier, the Bank is seeking funds to provide partial risk guarantee 
to the PA to provide comfort to private companies interested in investing in the energy sector while IFC is 
exploring options for investment. 

80. 
Integration of women’s empowerment into operations will be stepped up. To enhance the 
World Bank Group’s gender focus a comprehensive assessment of current and planned operational 
activities was undertaken during the first half of 2014, a practical gender action plan was developed and is 
being implemented across the portfolio. Enhancing female employment and making service delivery 
responsive to women’s needs will drive projects’ design and implementation.  
 
In the area of enhancing female employment, the ongoing programmatic jobs dialogue will 
include workshops on addressing binding constraints to women’s employment opportunities. Women’s 
school to work transition will be enhanced through the ongoing Education to Work Transition projec t. 
Sources of livelihood for women will be created through pilot projects including the Abraham Path and 
the Economic Development across Fragile Communities and the planned Online Outsourcing for Jobs and 
Youth Empowerment.  IFC will support programs to enhance women’s access to credit and female 
entrepreneurship. Female entrepreneurship will also be supported through the Government Services for 
Business Development project, which aims to deliver timely business development information, data and 
services targeting women business owners.  

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the area of making service delivery responsive to women’s needs, the Bank will include 
measures to enhance women’s decision-making, design, and consumer voice in urban development, 
energy and water sector projects. For example, the Second Municipal Development project will include a 
female quota in decision-making committees of municipalities applying for funding. The Energy 
Efficiency Action Plan (TA) will conduct quantitative and qualitative data collection to improve the 
understanding of energy consumption behavior of women. The Gaza Water Supply & Sewage System 
Improvement project includes a public awareness campaign targeting women as a subcomponent of the 
project as women play a crucial role in water consumption. Various service delivery projects will also 
collect women’s consumer feedback in citizen satisfaction surveys. 

81. 
Analytical and advisory activities will be strategically selected. The Bank’s analytical products 
will continue to inform project design and analyze emerging challenges. Knowledge products will 
respond to specific requests from the Palestinian Authority such as one recently received to propose an 
institutional structure for excellence in science and its applications in industry. IFC’s advisory activities to 
provide capacity building of private companies will be conducted with a view to improving access to 
finance and strengthening the financial sector, as well as PPPs. 

82. 
All assistance for Gaza will continue to be provided through the Palestinian Authority. 
Project implementation activities will be carried out through agencies of the PA such as utilities, higher 
education institutions and NGOs. Only the designated PA officials will be authorized to withdraw funds 
and sign off on the withdrawal applications. Disbursements for Gaza investment projects will continue to 
adhere to the Bank’s Anti Money-Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorists (AML/ CFT) 
Program.  IFC’s engagement in Gaza’s financial and telecommunications sectors will be through existing 
clients. 

D. Communications and Outreach 

83. 
The Bank Group will engage counterparts in the Palestinian Authority and development 
partners in all stages of preparation of major products. The Bank Group will increase its reliance on 
the internet to increase the availability of knowledge products both locally and internationally and in a 
timely manner. However, face–to-face meetings will continue—not only with counterparts in the PA but 
also in response to specific requests from the media, NGOs and individuals, many of whom follow the 
Bank’s knowledge products on the role of economics in the peace process. Partnership with local 
universities has been helpful for disseminating our products and the Bank will strengthen its relations 
with these academic institutions more systematically. Task teams will engage upstream with ECR staff 
for the most effective communication strategy.  

VI. RISKS 

84. 
The Bank Group’s operating environment is one of high risk. The recent Gaza crisis is a 
reminder of how worsening security challenges have the potential to derail program implementation (as it 
did in 2007-08). During July and August, 2014, the Bank’s office in Gaza within the UN compound had 
to be closed for 63 days, and Bank staff and their families had to remain without electricity and water. To 
mitigate this risk, the Bank has a resident security advisor who is in continuous contact with the UN’s 
security system. The program’s Emergency Response and Business Continuity Plan is reviewed and 
updated frequently.  

85. 
Program implementation is prone to periods of slow-down. Implementation of projects in 
Gaza is adversely affected by conflict such as during the recent eruption of violence. Conflict leads to 
declining private sector confidence and thus impedes IFC’s investments. To mitigate this risk, political 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and security developments are monitored routinely for the Bank Group to remain alert to any situation 
that may require adjustments to its program. The Bank draws upon its experience during 2000-2004, and 
again during 2006 to 2008 when international assistance to the Palestinian territories stalled. Having only 
one channel of providing assistance is risky, so in addition to the Palestinian Authority, the Bank will also 
partner with local communities, NGOs, utilities and educational institutions that can provide continuity of 
support in the event of program disruption due to violence. IFC will continue to play its countercyclical 
and development role in providing long-term financing not otherwise available. In the event that the 
investment climate worsens significantly and hampers IFC’s business development in the areas 
highlighted in this Assistance Strategy, IFC—as it has in the past—will resort to engaging through 
advisory support while focusing on strong portfolio management to mitigate risks on its balance sheet.  

86. 
Continued blockade of Gaza impedes investment projects from achieving their objectives. 
In this regard, maintaining good quality of the Bank’s operational portfolio that is located in Gaza 
remains a challenge.  A number of project implementation units rely on satellite staff in Gaza to supervise 
operations there, and communication between the West Bank and Gaza staff can be extremely d ifficult. 
Furthermore, the supply of goods, especially those required for larger infrastructure operations, requires 
an additional layer of support from the World Bank. For bringing into Gaza materials required to 
implement Bank-funded projects in the Gaza, the World Bank coordinates routinely with Israel’s  
COGAT, the body tasked with managing civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, to explain how the 
project inputs will be used. It is also exploring the possibility of collaborating with the UN Re lief and 
Works Agency, which has a framework agreement with the Government of Israel for moving donor -
supplied goods, to transport project materials from the border with Israel to the project site.  The access of 
materials will be essential also for the reconstruction of Gaza from the recent conflict 

87. 
A recent slow-down in the progress of public financial management reform placed risks on 
previous gains in this area. The Bank’s PEFA Assessment in 2013, conducted in partnership with donor 
partners, found some weaknesses including in accounting/reporting—mostly on accuracy grounds 
including a difference on 2013 monthly fiscal reports, audit qualifications in the 2010 financial statements 
(audited in 2013), while the 2011 financial statements are not yet issued. To mitigate the risk, the Bank 
will monitor PFM arrangements and, along with donor partners, support implementation of the Action 
Plan issued in October 2013. The Bank is providing technical assistance (TA) on downstream budget 
performance (execution, accounting/reporting) while the other donors (DfID and EU) are helping on 
budget preparation and audit. During the past year, the Bank has fielded six TA missions on cash 
planning and accounting/reporting and will continue to provide support in this area. In partnership with 
the EU, the Bank will help the PA to implement an accounting manual under development, and strengthen 
the accounting/reporting practices.  

88. 
Institution-strengthening, central to the Bank’s assistance, is threatened by the PA’s 
continuing fiscal challenges. The Bank has engaged in this long term development agenda since 1992. 
But the PA remains dependent upon high and unpredictable levels of aid. Donor fatigue and reduction in 
donor assistance is a significant source of risk to PA’s finances and the Palestinian economy as a whole. 
Fiscal pressures put at risk the provision of public services by the Palestinian Authority (the first pillar of 
this assistance strategy) and make structural reforms hard to undertake. The Bank mitigates against this 
risk by emphasizing in all development forums the need for donors to maintain their support, without 
which the significant gains in strengthening of public institutions will be lost.
